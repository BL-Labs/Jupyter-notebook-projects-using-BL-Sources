(the oldest merchant in Newcastle), died at his residence, Saville Eow, Newcastle-on-Tyne, at the patriarchal age of 95 years and 7 months. Up to the last his faculties were unclouded, and he quietly slumbered away, free from pain or suffering. Mr. Smith was a gentleman remarkably well informed on almost every topic. His commercial and business qualifications were of a very high order, and his knowledge and advice were always at the service of those who required them. October 13. \u2014 Died, at his residence, at Benwell, near Newcastle on-Tyne, at the age of 83 years, Joseph Straker, Esq., formerly of North Shields, an extensive shipowner and colliery proprietor. Ho was a considerable landowner, and his last purchase (only made a few weeks before his death) was the Stagshaw Close House Estate, near Corbridge. The deceased was retiring in his habits, and seldom took any part in public affairs, except in connection with objects of charity ; and he was a liberal contributor to all societies having for their aim the amelioration of the condition of the poor, by whom he was held in much esteem. His large commercial operations were marked by the strictest honour and integrity, and he had the respect and regard of all with whom he came in contact. October 13. \u2014 Died, at Wentworth Place, Newcastle- on-Tyne, aged 55 years, the Eev. W. Spencer. The deceased was a man of great probity and singular disinterestedness of heart, and will al ways be held in most affectionate memory by the many young men who have passed through his hands, who must feel that they not only owe him much fcr the pains he took in their education, but must look back with pleasure to the time they passed under his hospitable roof, with their labours lightened by his benevolence ajid kindness of disposition.

October 17.\u2014 The foundation stone of the Abbot Memorial Ragged and Industrial Schools, Gateshead, was laid by Mrs. Abbot, with a silver trowel, presented to her by the Mayor (George Miller, Esq.) on behalf of the inhabitants of the borough. The usual cere mony haviDg been gone through, Mrs. Abbot declared the stone duly laid, amid loud cheers. Sir W. Hutt, M.P. for the borough, then mounted the stone, and proposed a vote of thanks to Mrs. Abbot for her gift. A public tanquet was held the same evening, at the Queen's Head Inn, to commemorate the event. Dr. Cook, by general acclamation, was voted to the chair ; Mr. James Davi son was appointed vice-chairman. October 17. \u2014 The will of the late Sir Charles Monck, Bart., of Belsay Castle, Northumberland, was proved in the District Registry of Newcastle-on-Tyne. The personalty was sworn under \u00a390,000. He bequeathed to his grandson, Henry Nicholas Monck, \u00a34,(00, in addition to his provision under the settlement of marriage of his fathei and mother. To his butler he left \u00a3300, and to his housekeeper \u00a360, for their lorg and faithful services, free of duty. His real estate, and the residue of the personal, he bequeathed to his grandson, now Sir Arthur Edward Monck, Bart. There are certain real and landed estates situated at Bolam, Stamfordham, and Whalton, all in Northumberland,* the annual income from which is to accumulate till it reaches the sum of \u00a3100,000 ; his grandson, the present baronet, receiving therefrom, in the mean time, \u00a32,000 per annum. October 19. \u2014 A silver cradle was presented to the Mayoress of Newcastle-on-Tyne. The members of the Town Council of Newcastle subscribed individually for the purchase of a handsome silver epergne, on which was engraved \u2014 \" This epergne was presented by the Town Council of Newcastle to Mrs. Hunter, wife of the Right Worshipful William Hunter, Esq., Mayor of the Borough, on the occasion of the birth of a daughter during the mayoralty of her husband.\" The Sheriff of Newcastle (Mr, Richard Cail) was deputed to make the presentation. October 29.\u2014 A lamentable and fatal accident occured to Colonel Harrison, of the Madras Royal Artillery. He had served in India, Burmah, and China, and returned to England in March, 1866, and lived with his family at Whitburn, in the county of Durham. ' The deceased, in company with Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart.,' Cap tain Williamson, and Mr. Fred. Hume Wilcox, solicitor, of Sun derland, wfnt by invitation to shoot on the Edlingham Estate.

After he had dropped the cartridges into the breech, he closed it, and by the action raised the barrels, when one of them instantaneously went off. The deceased at that time was crossing in aline with the gun, about three yards distant, and the charge struck him on the left leg and he fell. The inside of the leg below the knee was blown away. At the coroner's inquest, the jury returned the following verdict :\u2014 \"Charles Henry Harrison, on the 29th October, 1867, accidentally received injuries from the discharge of a breech-loader, which caused his death, at Edlingham, on the same day.\" \u2014 Deceased was 42 years of age. October 30. \u2014 A destructive fire broke out on a farm at Elwick, about two miles east of Belford, in the occupation of Mr. George Chisholm, when seventy-one stacks of corn were burned, valued at \u00a32,500. The fire was evidently the work of an incendiary. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected mayors :- \u2014 Newcastle, Henry Angus, Esq., mayor ; John Mawson, Esq., sheriff. Gateshead, Robert Sterling Newall, Esq. ; Sunderland, Alrlerman Gourley, Esq. ; Durham, Alderman R. Robson, Esq. * South Shields, Alderman Stevenson, Esq. ; Tynemouth, Edward Shotton, Esq. November 15. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Dryburn, near Durham, H. L. Wharton, Esq., aged 78 years. As a county magistrate and gentlemen he was held in the highest esteem, and amongst the poor he was greatly venerated. To them he was a real benefactor, relieving their wants liberally, and, at the same time, in the most unostentatious manner. November 25. \u2014 Died, after a short illness, at his residence, Oxford Street, Mr. John Sabbage, Chief- Constable of Newcastle-on-Tyne. November 29. \u2014 The foundation stone of a new building, to be used for the Northern Counties' Orphan Institution, was laid by Mrs. Abbot, in the presence of the Bishop of the diocese, the Mayor, the Sheriff, and other members of the Corporation of Newcastle, and a large number of spectators. The site of the building is on the edge of the Town Moor of Newcastle. Mrs. Abbot, the lady who laid the foundation stone, most munificently provided the funds (which amounted to no less than \u00a35,000) required to defray the cost of erecting the building. December 2 \u2014 This morning, the Derwent Valley branch of the North-Eastern Railway was opened for traffic. December 2. \u2014 The Pearl, a steam-tug belonging to the Tyne, went out to sea in a heavy storm, in search of vessels to tow in ; and, after buffeting the waves for some time, watched by numbers of spectators on the piers and banks on the opposite side of the"], [14, "4 historical register op [a.d. 1867. haven, anunusually heavy sea was seen advancing to the steam tug. In less time than it\" takes to write the fact, the mass of water had completely engulphed the boat. For au instant \u2014 and an in stant only \u2014 were seen the spars of the Pearl, and then all was gone. The crew numbered four, viz. : \u2014 Robert Chisholm, captain ; John Chisholm, his brother, fireman; J. Walker, engineer ; and William Forster, a lad about 15 years of age, who had only joined the vessel the day before . December 2. \u2014 This evening, Mr. George Stanley, lessee of the Tyne Theatre, Newcastle-on-Tyne, made his first appearance in the character of Hamlet at that establishment. He was received with repeated rounds of applause ; throughout the performance he rivetted the attention of the audience ; and, at the close of the representation, received a well-merited call before the curtain. The principal scene, between Hamlet and Ophelia, was impersonated to perfection, both by Miss Desborough and Mr. Stanley. December 4. \u2014 Mr. Brewis, solicitor, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, left his home in his usual good health ; and when he arrived at his office, in the Arcade, he began to open and read his letters. While doing so, he was heard to fall by his clerk (Mr. Warter). Turning round, from the other side of a partition, which divided the office, he saw that Mr. Brewis had fallen from his chair, and was lying upon the floor. Mr. Warter immediately raised the poor gentle man's head, and gave an alarm. Medical assistance was sent for, and arrived within a period of ten minutes ; but it was of no avail, Mr. Brewis having died immediately after his fall. At the inquest, held the same day, the jury, through their foreman (Mr. Ralph Thompson, of the Arcade), returned a verdict, \" Died from natural causes.\" December 8. \u2014 On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Jobling, an alderman of Tynemouth, left his residence, Huntingdon Place, Tynemouth for the purpose of visiting his cousiu, Mr. Thomas Jobling, who was indisposed, and who resides at Point Pleasant, not far from Willing ton Viaduct. He remained at the house of his cousin until about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, when he left to catch the train at Howdon. After reaching the railway, he appears to have got on to the down line, and walked between the rails ; when the train, coming from Newcastle, knocked him down and killed him. A verdict of accidental death was returned, after evidence had been given to the effect that deceased was privileged to cross the bridge. The deceased gentleman was held in high esteem. To the poor he was an especial friend. A successful business man, his circumstances were such as to enable him to dispense his charity with an unsparing hand. December 12. \u2014 The remains of the late Mr. Alderman Joblino were interred in the family vault, in Earsdon Churchyard. Not withstanding that the funeral was of a strictly private character a number of gentlemen attended to pay their last respects to the"], [15, "A.D. 1867.] REMARKABLE EVENTS 5 memory of the departed. The funeral cortege proceeded from the residence of the deceased shortly after half- past ten o'clock ; and consisted of a hearse (containing the soffin, which was covered with black cloth and gilt mouldings), four mourning coaches, and fifteen private carriages. The chief mourners were, R. F. Jobling, Esq., Mark Jobling, Esq., and M. W. Lambert, Esq. ; pall-bearers, John Dryden, Esq., Joseph Laycock, Esq., Hugh Taylor, Esq. (Chipchase Castle), T. C. Leitch, Esq., Anthony Davison, Esq., and A. Pring, Esq. ; then followed the fifteen private carriages. The Mayor of Tyuemouth was also present in his carriage ; and with his worship were the ex-mayor (John Hedley, Esq.), and Aldermen Fawcus and Green. There were likewise present in carriages, Dr. Bourne, Alderman Joseph Spence ; Councillors Popplewell, Scott, and Gibson ; Messrs. E. Young, J. F. Spence, Joseph Robinson, R. Swan, J. Swan, W. Beaumont, R. S. Weir, W. Dunn, Jun., &c. ; also, Mr. Redpath, secretary of the Good Design Association (of which the late alderman was one of the vice-patrons, aud a warm supporter), and several of the members. On arriving at Earsdon, they were met by the Rev. R. F. Mason, incumbent, who conducted the funeral service in a very solemn and impressive manner. December 17. \u2014 A frightful and lamentable accident took place on the Town Moor, Newcastle-on-Tyne, whereby eight persons lost their lives, viz. :\u2014 Mr. John Mawson, Sheriff of the town ; Mr. Thomas Bryson, Town Surveyor * P.C. Donald Bain ; James Shot ton, employed by Mr. Turnbull, White Swan Yard ; Thomas Appleby, son of Mr. Appleby, Carliol Street, employed at Mr. Mr. George Hudson's, provision merchant. Cloth Market ; George Smith Stonehouse, a youth, son of Mr. Christopher Stonehouse, clock maker, Bath Row ; Samuel Bell Wadley, son of Mr. Charles Wadley, hat manufacturer, Heywood's Court, and residing at 47, Villa Place ; a man, aged about 40, and about 5 feet 6 inches in height, name unknown. A coroner's inquest was held on the body of Mr. Mawson, the sheriff ; he having had the principal directions in the proceedings. The following gentlemen were sworn on the jury by the coroner of the borough, J. T. Hoyle, Esq : Mr. J. M. Tilley (foreman), Mr. Owen, Mr. W. Guthrie, Mr. W. Brown, Mr. R. Charlton, Mr. J. Redshaw, Mr. J. 0. Sturgeon, Mr. W. Hepple, Mr. R. Cuthbertson, Mr. J. Wheatley, Mr. T. McKay, and Mr. J. Robinson. The Mayor, the Town Clerk, the Under Sheriff (Mr. W. S. Daglish), Dr. White, Mr. Cockroft (Coroner for South Northum berland), the Rev. H, W. Wright, Dr. Bolton, Mr. R. G. Green, Mr. Councillor Dickinson, Mr. Spark, Mr. Tennant, and others were present. From the evidence brought out at the inquest, it appeared that a considerable quantity of a very dangerous material, which, on examination, proved to be nitro-glycerine (for blasting purposes in mines, &c), was stored in a cellar at the White Swan Yard, Cloth Market. On examining the cellar, the police found eight tins. After conferring with the magistrates and Town Clerk, it was order ed to be removed out of the town or destroyed. Not being able"], [16, "6 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1867. to induce the Railway Company to carry it, it was decided to destroy it by removing it to the Town Moor, and emptying it into the earth at a part of the Moor where there was a subsidence in the ground, caused by the workings of the Spital Tongues Colliery. The Sheriff and Mr. Bryson determined to accompany the material to its destination, and see it destroyed. When on their way to the Moor, Mr. Mawson thought it desirable to examine one or two of the cases, for the purpose of ascertaining what kind of instruments would be required for opening them. While this was being done a number of people congregated round the cart which was convey ing the material, and afterwards accompanied it to the Moor. On arriving at the spot on the Moor,which is a little to the west of the Cholera Hospital, there were eight canisters in baskets, and one without a covering of that kind, taken from the cart and placed upon the turf; and, by direction ofthe Town Surveyor and the Sheriff, the cartman, the labourer, Sub -Inspector Wallace, and P.C. 34 A. Donald Bain (who had also been sent on this duty), pro ceeded to draw the corks. Mr. Bryson drew several ofthe corks, a pricker being used for the purpose. They emptied the liquid of the whole nine into the subsidence ofthe earth, and after this was done they found that three of the canisters still felt weighty. The Sheriff thereupon ordered the men to take off the ends, which was done by means of a shovel, when it was found that a portion of the contents had crystallised, and were adhering to the tin. The Sheriff expressed a desire to obtain a piece of the crystallised ma terial, and asked for a piece of paper, but what followed is not known. He said, however, \" Bring them away and we will bury them on the other hill,\" referring to a hill a little further from where they put the liquid material. He also gave directions to Sub- Inspector Wallace to place some soil over the spot into which they had poured the liquid. Wallace immediately engaged himself in this occupation, and Bain, Shotton, Appleby, the Sheriff, and the Town Surveyor, went away to the hill with the three canisters con taining the crystallised nitro-glycerine, for the purpose of burying it. What occurred here is unknown, and probably never will be. The Sub-Inspector had got his task completed, and was about leaving to join the others, when a dreadful explosion took place. Wallace felt the earth shake, and at the same time saw fragments of clothing and other articles flying high up in the air. Though so near to the scene of the explosion, he was happily uninjured himself, his escape being accounted for by the fact that the bank was between him and the explosion. He immediately proceeded to the spot, and, on the west side of the hill, where the explosion took place, found a portion of the body of P.C. Bain dreadfully mutilated and shattered \u2014 the other portions of the body, horrible to relate, being blown away. On the south side of the hill was also a body frightfully mutilated : this was the body of the cartman, Thomas Appleby ; and, near at hand, was the body of Shotton, the labourer, also mutilated. In a hole of the ground,"], [17, "A.D. 1867.] HEMARKABLE EVENTS. 7 immediately above, was a hoy alive, but greatly injured : this was the son of Mr. Wadley, living in Villa Place. The body of another man, unknown, was also found. Mr. Bryson, severely injured, was lying on the side of the bank to the eastward ; and immediately on the top of the bank was Mr. Mawson, who was also much injured. Wallace raised Mr. Bryson, but he was unable to speak Mr. Mawson was able to raise himself up, and sat upon the grass. Wallace, seeing* nothing could be done by himself to aid the unfor tunate sufferers, promptly got into the cab which had brought Mr. Mawson and Mr. Bryson up, and which was waiting some distance off, and drove into the town in order to procure medical aid. Rox burgh, the cabman, when left by Mr. Mawson and Mr. Bryson, was told to remain a few minutes. After waiting for a time, his horses began to get cold and weary, and he got upon the box and drove them about a little. His attention was thus drawn away from what was going on amongst the others. In a short time, however, the explosion took place. The force of it blew him off his seat on to the horses, and also broke the windows of the cab, though he was at least one hundred yards from the spot. On looking round, he saw clothes and one of the canisters flying in the air. He drove Sub-Inspector Wallace rapidly down into the town, and Wallace gave information of the occurrence to Mr. Joseph Fife and Dr. Heath, who immediately proceeded to the scene of the disaster. It was singularly fortunate that, at the moment of the catastrophe, Mr. Walpole, one of the resident surgeons at the Infirmary, was walking upon the Moor, at no great distance from where the explo- sion took place. Dust, stones, fragments of clothing, and other things suddenly surrounded him. Three hundred yards or so from the spot where the proceedings had been going on, he found the foot of a human being \u2014 presumably that of poor Bain ; and shreds of clothing, human flesh, and other matter lay scattered about. Mr. Walpole hurried forward, and discovered Mr. Bryson \u2014 a ghastly spectac'e \u2014 lying in one of the excavations. After those about had recovered their senses, it was proposed that, as Mr. Bryson to all appearance was dead, it would be as well to leave him in the adjoining hospital. Mr. Walpole, however, persevered, adminis- tered stimulants, and upon bis suggestion, the cart which had brought the destructive material to the ground was made a means of conveying those injured to the Infirmary. They were Mr. Bry- son, Town Surveyor * Mr. Mawson, the Sheriff of Newcastle ; and Samuel Wadley, a boy who hsd been a spectator. The boy Wad- ley died about two hours after being admitted into the Infirmary. Mr. Mawson and Mr. Bryson both died tbe following night. The jury returned the following vtrdict : \u2014 \" That death has been caused by the explosion of nitro-glycerine accidentally ; and the jury are unanimously of opinion that the law in reference to the storing of nitro-glycerine has been grossly violated in this case.\" December . 9. \u2014 The Darlington Town Council met for the pur pose of appointing a mayor iu the room of Mr. Joseph Pease, who"], [18, "[a.d. 1867. 8 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF had declined to accept the appointment on account of age and in firmity. There was a full attendance of the members. The Re turning Officer, Mr. J. H. Bowman, presided. Councillor Walton proposed Mr. Henry Pease as a fit and proper person to fill the office. He remarked that Mr. Pease's election would do honour and credit to the town. Councillor Potts seconded the proposition. No other gentleman being proposed, Mr. Pease was declared duly elected. Having made the declaration, the Mayor then addressed the council, remarking that he had at one time thought that he could not, with his many other public duties, accept the appoint ment. He had, however, consented, and would discharge the duties devolving on him to the best of his ability. The Mayor then invited the council to partake of breakfast on the first day of the new year. He did not think it would be necessary in Darlington to go to any place of worship in procession, as was done in some towns on any particular Sunday. Alderman Joseph Pease offered some remarks, with a view of preventing anything being done by the mayor as now proposed, being converted into a precedent, and becoming an expense upon members of the future. The mayor, in reply, said he looked upon the present as a special occasion, being t he first appointment of mayor, and had no intention of setting up a precedent. December 21.\u2014 An alarming fire broke out this morning at the top of Akenside Hill (formerly Butcher Bank,), Newcastle-on-Tyne, causing great destruction of property. It appears that the fire really originated in the warehouse of Messrs. Bell & Duun, ship-chandlers, Queen Street. It was first seen about seven o'clock in the morning by a young man named Richardson, in the employment of Mr. William Southern, timber merchant, whose offices adjoin Bell and Dunn's warehouse. Every exertion was made to extinguish the flames, but it was not till near one o'clock that they were mastered. Every available fire engine was got out, and set to work, having those from Tyne Dock, as well as Gateshead. The cause of the fire is unknown. The cost of the buildings destroyed amounted to about \u00a318,000. December 22. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Eldon Place, Newcastle-on- Tyne, Alderman James Hodgson, Esq., aged 79 years, a magistrate of the borough, Chairman of the Finance Committee ofthe Corpora tion, and one of the directors of the North-Eastern Railway. Mr. Hodgson, for a considerable time, occupied a prominent position in his native town. His father, Mr. Solomon Hodgson, having suc ceeded to the proprietorship of t he Newcastle Chronicle (on the\u00b0death of his father-in-law, Mr. Thomas Slack, in 1784, who originated that newspaper in 1763), continued to conduct the paper until his death in 18U0, at the early age of 40 years. His widow succeeded to the property, which she continued to conduct until 1822, when she died in Union Street, in her 63rd year. From that period the late al derman and his brother Thomas carried on the Chronicle until it"], [19, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1867. was disposed of to Messrs. Lambert. Being thus, as it were, brought up to politics, the deceased took an active part in the discussion of ths various topics of the day as they occurred. He was a keen Liberal in his early years, and supported all the Liberal measures propounded by Earl Grey, Mr. Lambton, Mr. Brougham, and other reformers. He also took a prominent part in affairs ofthe town. He was elected one of the town councillors for St. John's Ward, after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act, in 1835. He was also elected an alderman by the New Council \u2014 an office he retained until his death. He filled the office of mayor in 1811, and was again elected to that honourable post in 1851, on both of which occasions he discharged the duties of his position with a becoming liberality and dignity. December 31. \u2014 This day, was presented to Joseph Hunter, pedes trian postman, at Haltwhistle, a New Year's gift. The subscription, which had been readily raised, amounted to \u00a313 7s. 6d., which was expended as follows, for his benefit : \u2014 A complete suit of clothes, one pair of blankets, a double set of underclothing, overcoat and leggings, new hat, a pair of strong boots, a pair of first-class Hexham tans, a pocket knife, a walking stick, and a purse containing six pounds and one penny. He had, for thirteen years, walked a dis tance of fifteen miles a day, Sundays excepted, over a country, especially in the winter season, almost impassable. He had thus traversed a distance of 40,840 English miles in 4,069 days : a greater distance than the circumference of our globe. He had never been subject to an hour's illness, nor had ever been reported absent from duty. Hunter is a spare man, of remarkably temperate habits, and about 60 years of age. 1868 (January \"J. \u2014 This evening, in the National School Room, Wooler, amidst a crowded assemblage of the towns-people, a beauti ful silver fruit or flower vase was presented by Mr. James Rea, in the name of the merchants and tradesmen of the town of Wooler, to Lady St. Paul, as a token of welcome on her arrival in Glendale after a foreign tour, and a congratulation on her recent marriage to Sir Horace St. Paul, Bart.

Januarys. \u2014 This evening the Mayor of Sunderland, (Alderman Gourley) gave a grand banquet to the Corporation, Magistrates, the Military and Consular body, in the Queen's Hotel.

January 8. \u2014 The Haswell steamer, belonging to Messrs. Hugh Taylor and Partners, made sixty voyages to London and back, from the Wear to the Thames in the preceding year, forty-one of them being from the 20th of May. The average cargo, at each voyage, would be about 850 tons of coals, so that the quantity for the sixty voyages would be about 50,000 tons. January 13. \u2014 Prince and Princess Teck passed through Stockton on their way to visit Earl Vane, at his princely seat at Wynyard. At four o'clock, the time at which the train was due, an immense concourse of people, estimated at from 7,000 to 10,000 had as sembled before the station to obtain a view of the royal party. The Stockton battalion of the 1st Durham Rife Volunteers, under the commandos Captains Faber and Watson, formed a guard of honour to the royal guests from the platform to the carriages outside the station. The Mayor (R. Jackson, Esq.) and the body corporate, in their robes, were also assembled to welcome the Prince and Princess. Amongst those present on the plalform were Earl Vane, Lord Seaham, Lord Powerscourt, Loid and Lady Wenlock, Sir George Wombwell, the Hon. H. Vane Tempest, Marshall Fowler, Esq., J. P., T.

Agreeable to the wishes of the royal guests, no formal address was presented, but on the Prince aud Princess s'epping from the saloon carriage on to the platform, they were introduced by Earl Vane to the Mayor and members ofthe Corpora tion. Princess Mary, addressing the Mayor, said, \" This is the first time I have visited your town, and I am much pleased with its"], [21, "11 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1868 appearance.\" The Mayor then welcomed their Royal Highnesses, saying to the Princess\u2014\" May it please your Royal Highness, on behalf of myself, the Mayor of this borough of Stockton-on-Tees, and the gentleman of the Corporation, I beg permission to offer our congratulations on your safe arrival in the county of Durham, and more especially to bid you welcome to this our ancient borough. I beg to assure your Royal Highnesses of our constant, devoted, and most loyal attachment to the person and throne of Her Majesty, as well as to every member and branch of her family.\" The royal party were then escorted to tho carriages in waiting, when Her Royal Highness the Princess Teck said \u2014 \u25a0\" Mr. Mayor, I beg most sincerely to thank you for these demonstrations of your loyalty. In times like the present, I assure you that it does one good to see such marks of loyalty aud affection.\" His Royal Highness Prince Teck then cordially shook hands with tho Mayor, and briefly thanked him for the welcome given them ; and the party drove off amidst the heartiest demonstrations to the seat of Earl Vane, at Wynyard Park. January 17. \u2014 A public meeting took place at the Old Council Chambers, Guildhall, Newcastle-on-Tyne, for the purpose of form ing a society for establishing a School-Ship on the river Tyne, for the reception of boys who, through poverty, parental neglect, or being orphans, or from any other cause are left destitute and home less. For this purpose, the Admiralty had placed the frigate Diana at the service of the society. The Mayor (Mr. Henry Angus), in opening the meeting, expressed his gratification in seeing such a numerous body of gentlemen gathered together for the purpose of assisting to carry out the object they had in view. He called on Mr. Hall to move the first resolution, who was followed by Hugh Taylor, Esq., the Mayor of Tynemouth (Edward Shotton, Esq.), Mr. C. M. Palmer, Mr. Alderman Dale (South Shields), Mr. D. D. Main, the Rev. Dr. Bruce, Mr, John Straker, the Mayor of South Shields (J. C. Stevenson, Esq.), Mr. E. Glynn, and Mr. Redmayne. Mr. John Ormston proposed, and Mr. George Luckley seconded, a vote of thanks to the mayor for presiding. A subscription list was then opened, which, in a short time, amounted to \u00a31,000. January 22. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Lipwood House, near Haydon Bridge, aged 83 years, John Grey, Esq., for many years land-agent for the Greenwich Hospital Estates. The deceased will always be remembered as a great benefactor to the farming interest ; and his life, which had been spared beyond the allotted term, had been spent in the useful endeavour to increase and multiply the fruits of the earth, whereby man may be sustained. Possessed of a robust constitution, and a strong and vigorous frame, he was capable of undergoing great fatigue ; but the great monetary panic of 1857, when the Northumberland and Durham District Bank closed its doors, was, to use a common expression, \"the first nail in his coffin.\" Being a large shareholder in that unfortu-"], [22, "12 A.D. 1868.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. nate concern, and having implicit faith in its management, he felt the catastrophe most keenly. Finding the infirmities of old age stealing upon him, he gave up his appointment and his residence at Dilston, to reside at Lipwood House, and spend the remainder of his life in retirement and quiet. He was succeeded in the agency of the Greenwich Hospital Estates by his son, Mr. C. Grey. The deceased's eldest son, Mr. Geo. A. Grey, is a most extensive land-agent, and resides at Millfield Hill, near Wooler,and is well known and highly respected for his many admirable qualities. January 22. \u2014 Lord and Lady Boyne gave a grand ball at Brance peth Castle, which was attended by about 150 of the nobility and neighbouring gen ' ry. Amongst those present were the Earl and Countess Vane ; L >rd and Lady Bolton ; Lady Catherine Russell; the Honourable Misses Liddell, Ravensworth Castle ; Mr. I. L., Mrs., aud the Misses Bell, Washington ; Mr., Mrs., and the Misses Webster, Pailion House ; and a host of rank and fashion. January 22. \u2014 The will of Joseph Straker, Esq., of Benwell, Northumberland, was proved in the District Registry, at Newcastle on-Tyne, and the personalty sworn under \u00a3200,000, the executors and trustees being John Straker, Esq., testator's son, and John Coppin, Esq. The will was dated June 30, 1803, and a codicil, June 28, 1867; the testator dying on October 13 following. To his eldest son he bequeathed a legacy of \u00a310,000 ; to his son George the interest of \u00a325,000 for life ; aud the principal to his children ; his estates to his son-in-law, Henry Straker, for life ; and afterwards to the sons of the latter, Joseph and Henry Straker. February 25. \u2014 The Church of St. Barnabas, together with a large burial ground, the gift of the Earl of Durham to the newly formed parish of Burnmoor, near Fence Houses, was consecrated this day by the Lord Bishop of Durham. March 13. \u2014 One of the largest and most brilliant assembleges that has ever been seen within the walls of the Tyne Theatre, New castle, did honour to the prince of comedians, Mr. Charles Matthews. Never, perhaps, in the course of his long and successful career, was the veteran actor more highly appreciated or received with greater enthusiasm. Mr. Matthews played the part of Sir Charles Gold stream, in the comedietta entitled Used Up, and kept the house in a continued roar of laughter from the begining to the end of the piece. March 15. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Eldon Square, Newcastle-on- Tyne, David Blair White, Esq., M.D., in his 68th year. Dr. White seldom or ever took any part in public affairs. His chief delight was in his profession, and how to confer the benefits of his large experience and advice on all who desired it. He was for many years physician to the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Dispensary and Fever House ; and, at his death, was physician to the Newcastle Infirmary and Gateshead Dispensary."], [23, "13 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1868. March 16. \u2014 Died, in the Corporation West End Baths, Sunder land, Mr. George Hardcastle, the well-known auctioneer of that town, at the age of 65 years. For some time prior to his death the deceased had been suffering from heart disease. Before going to the Baths he called at the shop of Mr. Walton, chemist, and left a bottle for some prussic acid, for which he was to call at night ; he also took a single drop at the time, to ease the pain at his heart. He was then told not to follow it by a bath, but this caution he appears not to have heeded. After having been about ten minutes in his bath room, the attendant informed Mr. Crass that she heard a moaning noise in Mr. Hardcastle's bath room ; and, on the bath keeper proceeding thither, he saw Mr. Hardcastle leaning his head on the frame work of the bath. Mr. Crass called for assistance, and deceased was placed on the seat, and partially recovered, while a messenger was sent for a surgeon. Mr, Lang and Dr. Yeld were not long in arriving at the baths, but their services were of no avail. Medical evidence showed that the deceased had had heart disease, and that the prussic acid had not injured him. A verdict of \" Natural Causes\" was returned at the inquest. March 26. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, aged 98, Isabella, widow ofthe late Mr. Matthew Gibson, shoemaker, who died in his 88th year. Mr. John Gibson, of Alnwick Moor, gives the following particulars respecting the ages of other members of the family : \u2014 His mother's father, John Taylor (for 52 years head gardener at Howick Hall), died at the age of 94. He never slept one night out of the parish of Howick. Mr. Gibson's grandmother^Margery Duncan, of Howick, was 96 at the time of her death, her sister 99, their father 101, and their mother 100 ; his aunt was 92 ; and his uncle (John Taylor) died in the service of the Doubledays, of Newcastle, at the age of 90. His mother was the last of her race. April 16. \u2014 A presentation was made to John Eden, Esq., of Beamish Paik, county of Durham, of a magnificent piece of solid silver plate, in the shape of a centre-piece, standing on a plateau of the same material, by his tenantry. Instead of a formal presenta tion in public, this handsome gift was sent direct to his residence with the accompanying letter : \u2014 Easter, 18G8. '* Deae Sib., \u2014 We are deputed by every tenant-farmer on your estate at Beamish, Bishopton, Burdon, Redmarshall, and Westerton, to offer you this centre-piece and plateau of solid silver, as a token of our sincere esteem and respect for you as your landlord, and in recognition of yonr liberality to us in times of agricultural depression. We have purposely abstained from any demonstration of our goodwill to you in the shape of a public presentation, feeling sure that such a course would not be so congenial to yonr feelings as the one we have adopted. It will be gratifying to yon to know that, in many instances, we have had a difficulty in preventing our brother tenants giving more than they could afford, so anxious were they to do you honour. We have no hesitation in saying that the mcney value of this present might have been doubled, had we not studied what we believed would be your wish to restrain within moderate bounds the expression of our regard. In the earnest hope that yon will be pleased to accept this tribute of our respect, and that you may long be spared to us as our landlord, \u2014 Wo remain, &c.\""], [24, "14 A.D. 1863.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. Mr. Eden forwarded the following reply to the douors : \u2014 Beamish Park, April 16, 1868. \" G-entlemen, \u2014 I wish I could find words (satisfactory to myself) to express to you my thanks for the magnificent present you have this day made me. Highly as I appreciate this flattering mark of your esteem, Ifeel still inoro the very kind expressions you have used in making this presenta tion to me. I will ever value it as it deserves, and leave it as an heirloom to my successors ; and I trust it will prove an incentive to them to cultivate the goodwill of their tenants. Where our interests are identical, this should not bo a very difficult task. \" I remain, your obliged Friend, \"JOHN EDEN.\" The well-known firm of Messrs. Reid and Sons, silversmiths, Newcastle-on-Tyne, supplied tho plate, and it amply sustained their high reputation for design and workmanship. May 2. \u2014 An inquest was held on the body of John Cruikshanks, one of the members of the Durham County Constabulary, at Pitting- ton, about four miles from Durham. A constable \"named of Paton, who was stationed at Sherb urn, close to Pittington, had been guilty of some irregularities, and Cruikshanks lodged information with his superior respecting him. Paton was ordered to appear before Lieutenant-Colonel White, at Durham, the result of the investiga- tion being that he received his discharge. About five o'clock, Cruik- shanks and another man named McKay left Durham, and proceeded on their way home. Shortly afterwards, they were joined by Paton, who had remained behind in Durham. There does not appear to have been any altercation on the road, nothing, indeed to indicate the terrible tragedy that was to follow, aud when they arrived at Sherburn Bridge, Cruikshanks desired to turn down the Durham and Sunderland Railway line, as it was a nearer way. Paton, how- ever, stated that he had received some information from the office, at Durham, which he would require to hand over to Cruikshanks, who accordingly accompanied him to the village, McKay going with them. Cruikshanks did not go so far as the house, but remained iu the village, at a distance of 20 or 30 yards ; McKay following in the direction of Paton's house, where he intended calling for tho Police Gazettes. When he got to the house, Paton was coming out by the kitchen door, his right arm being behind his back, when his wife shouted '* He has something !\" This was just after Mckay had sat down. He looked out of the window, and saw Cruikshanks running and Paton after him, towards Mr. Thompson's public- house. He ran to the door, and was just outside, when he saw Paton shoot Cruikshanks as he was entering the dooi of the public- house. After the first shot, Paton fired again. McKay ran towards him, and Paton shot himself. He put the pistol to his ear on the right side, and fired. McKay got hold of him just as he fell. Mr. Shaw, surgeon, when called in, found Cruikshanks dead, and saw Paton a few minutes before he died. The coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against David Paton, so far as the death of John Cruikshanks was concerned. As to Paton's own death, _."], [25, "15 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1868. verdict of suicide, but whether in a sane or insane state of mind when committed, they had not sufficient evidence to show. The men were natives of Scotland, and both married with families. May 2.\u2014 Died, at Scarborough, aged 65, J. W. Carmichael, Esq., artist, formerly of Newcastle-on-Tyne. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to Messrs. Farringdon, shipbuilders, North Shore, Newcastle. From childhood he manifested an ardent love for the art of which he subsequently became so true and faithful an exponent. The deceased left his native town for the metropolis in the year 1848, where he resided till within two years of his decease, when he removed to Scarborough, in order that he might be within sight of the boundless ocean, which afforded him endless pleasure to study and to paint. Up to within a day of his death he was actively engaged in his professional studies. This morning, however, he was suddenly seized with a fit of apoplexy, which abruptly terminated his brilliant career. In private life he was an unostentatious, benevolent, good man, and kind-hearted to a fault. May 12. \u2014 The Tees Valley Railway was formally opened to-day, aud great rejoicing took place along its whole length. The new line commences at a point near Barnard Castle, and passes through a country unrivalled for natural scenery ; and the pleasant villages of Lartington, Cotherstone, Romaldkiu, Mickleton, and its terminus, Middleton-in-Teesdale. June 4. \u2014 Died, at St. Anthony's, near Walker, Newcastle-on-Tyne, aged 37 years, Robert Chambers, the greatest natural sculler the world ever saw. His remains were interred in the Walker Cemetery, on Sunday the 7th June. Rarely has the death of a local man occasioned so much genuine compassion and sym pathy, the very name of Chambers being a household word ; and so long as acquatics are a standard, or even a humble, recreation in England, so long will the name of him, whose decease we now record, be revered and honoured. Most, if not all, of Chambers's friend were at the funeral. Up to a certain time the public were admitted to the death chamber, merely being permitted to glance at the face of one who was dear to them. Near to the head of the coffin sat the widow of Chambers, heart-broken with grief, and weeping bitterly. This was the most striking and sad part of a bitter and melancholy reality. Shortly before three o'clock, the body was screwed down, and conveyed to the front of the house where an impressive hymn was sung by members ofthe choir, the public joining. Tbe pall-bearers were, Mr. Thomas White, Mr. Edward Winship, Mr. A. Thompson, Mr. M. Scott, and Mr. James Taylor The whole of the local Friendly Societies, together with members of the local boating and acquatic clubs walked in proces sion. The number of persons assembled along the whole route, which was over a mile, was calculated to be from 50,000 to 60,000. Such a spectacle has, indeed, never been witnessed in any part of the North, The deceased, whose sterling integrity won for him"], [26, "16 a.d. 1868.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. the happy distinction of \" Honest Bob,\" was born at St. Anthony s, on the 14th of June, 1831. His earlier years were spent at Hawks's, in whose extensive ironworks on the Tyne he worked his way up until he reached the position of a puddler. Having a fancy for the water, and delighting in rowing, he attracted the attention of Harry Clasper, who saw, in his well-built, strong, and muscular form, the elements of a first-class oarsman : he standing about 5 feet 10 inches, and in rowing generally weighed about 11| stones. His after-career, under the guidance of Clasper, was unparalleled. He rowed in 101 races, winning 89 times ; he started 45 times in skiff's, and won 34 times ; he took part in 45 four-oared races, and won 40 ; he rowed in 19 pair contests, and won 15. For six years he held the Championship of the Thames, and was the first Tyne side oarsman that ever won the proud title of the \" Champion of the World.\" June 11. \u2014 The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of Gates head Town Hall took place at three o'clock this day, and by that hour a very large number of ladies and gentlemen had assembled together. For the accommodation of the spectators, two platforms were erected, the one adjoining West Street being set apart for ladies and the members of the Corporation, and the other in Swin burne Place, for gentlemen. Unfortunately, about the end of the proceedings, the platform iu Swinburne Place gave way in the centre. Those that were in the middle, fell down heavily a depth of 10 or 12 feet, several being very much injured, and James Barnett died on the 11th of August, from the effects of the accident. It is almost needless to add that the proceedings connected with the ceremony of the day were not carried out as intended. June 23, \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day, and were remarkably well attended. The Northumberland Plate was won by Captain Gray's Fortunio (Snowdon), beating Tynedale.Taraban, and six others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. C. Percy's Ainsley (J. Hudson), beating Stathconan, Honesty, and four others. Stewards : The Earl of Durham, Earl of Westmorland, Sir F. John stone, Bart., J. Merry, Esq., M.P., M. A. De Montgomery, George Fenwick, Esq., and T. Eustace Smith, Esq., Mr. Thomas Craggs, secretary, clerk of the course, and stake-holder ; Mr. R. Johnson, judge and handicapper; Mr. Marshall, starter. June 27. \u2014 Died, at her residence, Simonburn Cottage, Hums haugh, near Hexham, at the age of 77 years, Mrs. Evans, widow of the late Rev. David Evans, Rector of Simonburn. Few individuals in this district were so much beloved and respected. Asa supporter and contributor to the various charitable and religious objects in the neighbourhood, few, if any, exceeded her. In repairing the chancel of Simonburn Church she expended no less than \u00a3600 ; and although a consistent church woman, the erection of the neat Wesleyan Chapel, at Humshaugh, was, in no small degree, owing to her beneficence and assistance. At a cost of nearly \u00a31,000, she"], [27, "A.D. 1868.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 17 had the water brought into the village, and the block of Almshouses in the centre of Humshaugh, for widows aud single women of that place and Simonburn, bespeak her large-hearted generosity. June 29 \u2014 A very pleasing ceremony took place this day. A deputation waited upon the Rev. Dr. Bruce, to present him with his portrait, painted in oil, by Signor Cecil. The portrait was sub scribed for by a number of old pupils of Percy Academy. The following is the inscription on the plate below the portrait : \u2014 \" Pre sented to the Rev. John Collingwood Bruce, L.L.D., F.A.S , &c, by a number of old pupils of Percy Street Academy, as a token of re spect and esteem, June, 1868.\" Among the subscribers were pupils who attended Dr. Bruce's Academy some thirty years ago, such as John Taylor Ramsay, Esq , Walbottle Hall ; Thomas Ramsay, Esq., Sherburn Green ; Mr. Councillor Daggett, Newcastle ; Mr. James Ingledew, Newcastle ; Mr. J. J. Scott, Newcastle, &c. Mr. Robert Eadie, F.R.G.S., in introducing the subject to the rev. doctor; said that the picture had emanated from a very large number of the doctor's old pupils, who were desirous of testifying their admira tion of his great talents, and the respect they entertained for him in retirement. They wished him every happiness and long life. \u2014 The Doctor feelingly replied, and expressed his thanks to the subscribers for their kindness. July 4. \u2014 Died suddenly, at Darlington, Dr. Clarkson, one of the leading men of the town, who was highly respected, and whose death was much regretted. The deceased was a man of marked ability, and comparatively young. He left a widow and a young family to mourn his loss. July 4. \u2014 Died, at Lemington, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, at the age of 61 years, John Green, Esq., of Newcastle. Mr. Green, who was architect for the Duke of Northumberland, had been making a survey of several works in progress for His Grace at Tyneside. On his return towards Newcastle, when opposite Newburn Hall, where the Walbottle waggon-way crosses the turnpike in an oblique and awkward manner, Mr. Green was thrown from his gig, either by the horse stumbling, or the sudden action of the springs, and was found insensible in the middle of the road, much injured about the face, and with two ribs braken. He was removed to Lemington, and attended by Dr. Davison, of Newburn, and Dr. Armstrong, of Newcastle, up to the time of his decease ; his constituton, from his age, not being strong enough to sustain the heavy shock and injuries he had received. July 21. \u2014 Died, at Kingston, Surrey, aged 70 years, the Rev. Christopher Reed, Vicar of Christ Church, North Shields. The deceased possessed the living upwards of 30 years, having been appointed by Hugh, Duke of Northumberland. During the latter 12 years of his life he had not been in full residence in the parish, owing to ill health, and his duties were discharged by a senior curate. He occasionally visited the parish, and took up his residence o"], [28, "18 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1SG8. at the vicarage, Chirton. The late vicar married a sister of Edward J. Collingwood, Esq., of Lilburn Tower. July 29. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Cleveland Lodge, Great Ayton, aged 71 years, Mr. John Pease, being the oldest member of the Pease family. The deceased gentleman was in his youth associated with the railway and other enterprises which have made the name of Pease famous in the north-eastern part of England. The de ceased gentleman usually resided in Darlington, and was highly respected, and largely engaged in promoting religious, philanthropic, and educational objects. August 2. \u2014 A great fire took place at the Friars' Goose Chemical works, situate on the south side of the river Tyne, causing a heavy amount of damage to the works. The fire broke out a little before ten o'clock in the forenoon, and it burnt until midnight, before it was fairly extinguished, during which time its ravages were dreadful. The whole of the sulphuric acid chambers, with their contents, and the machinery beneath were destroyed. So, also, was what is called the burning house, the laboratory, the joiners' shops, the store houses, the wheelwrights' shop, the blacksmiths' shop, and the reading room and library belonging to the works. The fire, during its progress, sent up immense clouds of smoke, which darkened the sky for many miles around during the whole afternoon. August 2. \u2014 Died, at Chelsea Hospital, where he was governor, at the age of 90 years, Field Marshal Sir Edward Blakeney, G.C.B., and G.C.H. He was born in Newcastle-on-Tyne, and entered the army as cornet in the 8th Light Dragoons in the early part of 1 794. August 18. \u2014 Died, at his residence, in Claypath, Durham, aged 58 years, Mr. J. E. Marshall, solicitor, after a long and painful illness. Deceased was one of the oldest practising solicitors in the city. He was at one time a member of the corporation, and sat in the Council Chamber for many years \u2014 first as councillor for the North Ward, and then as an alderman. At the time of his death he held the following appointments : \u2014 Clerk to the County Court, at Sunderland ; Clerk to the Vestry of St. Margaret's, Durham ; Clerk to the Parish Church of Belmont, near Durham, and Chair man of the Durham Gas Company. August 18. \u2014 Died, at his house, Claypath, Durham, aged 97 years, Mr. Matthew Wardell. The deceased was going about as was his wont until a day or two prior to his death, in the full and unimpaired exercise of all his mental faculties. He was one ofthe leading builders in Durham ; and one of those who served an apprenticeship with him was the Mayor of Durham for 1868 (R. Robson, Esq). The deceased was a Wesleyan of the old school, and was well known and generally respected. August 20.\u2014 Died, or burnt to death, in the awful catastrophe on the Chester and Holyhead Railway, near Abergele, North Wales John Harrison Aylmer, Esq., of Walworth Castle, in the County of"], [29, "A.D. 1868.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 19 Durham, J.P. and D.L., aged 56 years ; Rosanna Louisa Aylmer, his wife, aged 47 years ; Arthur Fitzgerald Harrison Aylmer, of Trinity College, Cambridge, their eldest son, aged 18 years ; and Miss Rosalie Frank, of Dundrum, Ireland, their cousin, aged 27 years. It appears that this accident was caused by a number of waggons belonging to a goods train to Holyhead becoming detached, and running back down the incline, meeting the mail train going 40 miles an hour. The waggon that first came in contact with the mail train was laden with paraffin oil, which, exploding when the collision occurred, the engine, tender, and three first-class carriages were smashed up together and took fire. The whole of the inmates of the carriages, 33 in all, perished. August 26. \u2014 A serious accident occured to Mr. John Hare, of Grey Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, pianoforte-dealer and music- seller, and to whose enterprise the public of this town aud the north of England are indebted for the pleasure of many first-class concerts. It appears that Mr. Hare and his family were staying at Whitley, and that Mr Hare, after being at business in Newcastle, went by train to Tynemouth, proceeded to walk to Whitley, and entered a gateway which led to a shorter route. He walked at a rapid pace, and the night being dark and stormy, he unfortunately walked into a quarry situated at the east side of tho Whitley road. He was so severly injured that he was unable to rise, and lay there helpless until the following morning, between five aud six o'clock, when he was discovered and conveyed to tho Quarry Inn. Fortunately Mr. Field, of Grey Street, was staying there, aud recognised him, and immediately telegraphed for Dr. Heath, of Newcastle ; and, in the meantime, Mr. Fletcher, of Shields was sent for. On the arrival of the medical gentleman it was found that both Mr. Hare's legs were broken above the ankle, and it was found that the spine also was injured, as the unfortunate gentleman complained much of pain in the back. He was, however, quite sensible and able to converse and describe how the accident occurred. After proper medical treatment, and in the course of a few months, he recovered the use of his legs and got quite strong again. Mr. Hare, during his infliction, had the heartfelt sympathy of the public, by whom he is so well known and respected. August 30. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Earsdon, near Tynemouth, aged 79 years, Hugh Taylor, Esq. Ihe deceased was engaged in the service of the second Duke of Northumberland in 1808, as check viewer, and in 1810 he succeeded his father as colliery agent and bailiff of the manor of Newburn. Afterwards Mr. Taylor was named as one of three commissioners who superintended the vast ducal estates, and in the year 1847 he was appointed sole commis sioner by the ever-memorable Duke Algernon. Prior to receiving that appointment, Mr. Taylor had been nominated to the chairman ship of the Coal Trade Association, and for the better part of half a-century he personally superintended and developed the immense"], [30, "[a.d. 1868. 20 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF agricultural and mining resources ofthe Northumberland Estates. Only a man of exceptional powers could have undertaken a task so onerous, yet Mr. Taylor was equal to it. His loss was felt in many circles, but his name is certain to be remembered among those who have brought the trade and agriculture of the north to their present admittedly high state of excellence. His funeral took place on the 3rd September at Newburn church, near Newcastle, the family burial place. The body had been lying at Earsdon, where Mr. Taylor died, since the time of his decease, and had to be removed thence to Newburn. The village of Earsdon had been in mourning during the whole time that his remains laid there. He had lived in the place for the long period of 47 years, and was respected and beloved by every person about it. The priucipal mourners arrived at the house ofthe deceased at ten o'clock, and the funeral proces sion started for Newburn at half-past. It consisted of the hearse and five mourning coaches, and the private carriages of Miss Taylor, of Earsdon, a sister of the deceased ; and of Mr. Stephenson, of Throckley, a near relative. The mourning coaches were occupied by the following gentlemen: \u2014 1st, Mr. C. H. Taylor, Mr. Hugh Taylor, Rev. Hugh Taylor and Mr. John Taylor, nephew of the deceased. 2nd, Captain Lowrey (Throckley), Mr. Charles Taylor and Mr. J. Fenwick. 3rd, Rev. R. Mason, Rev. Robert Scott, Mr. Robert Bell, and Dr. Pyle. 4th aud 5th, tenants and servants of the deceased, namely \u2014 Mr. Storey, Mr. Stuart, Mr. Whitehead, Mr. Watson, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Trove, Mr. Thornton, Mr. Jacob Wilkin, Mr. Patterson, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Geldie. The procession reached Newcastle about half-past twelve. As soon as it entered the town, the bells of St. Nicholas began a mournful peal, which was continued during the whole time the procession pissed through the town. At the end of Neville Street the procession halted, to allow it being augmented by a large party of the family and friends of the deceased residing in this part of the county, and also by a great number of private carriages, which had assembled by pre-arrangement in front of the Neville Hotel. Four mourning coaches were here added to the procession. They contained the following gentlemen : \u2014 Mr. Straker, Mr. Morrison, Mr. R. P. Philipson, Rev. J. D. Clark (Belford), Col. Maude, Mr. Charles Lamb, Mr. C. M. Laws, Mr^ R. Plummer, Mr. Doubleday, Mr. Joseph Snowball, Mr. R. S Johnson, Mr. John Dryden, Mr. Joseph Laycock, Mr. R. Leadbitter, aud Mr. Atkinson.

He (the mayor) had been re quested to bear public testimony to this act of kindness aud generosity ; and he did so with no reluctance, except that of appear ing personally before them. He was sure, however, that he could not do wrong in asking the audience to join him iu thanking Madlle. Titiens for the uoble sentiment that had brought her there that day. Mr. Hare begged him also to thank all present for co-operatiug in the generous sympathy of Madlle. Titiens. February 8. \u2014 The river Tyne was the scene of a great flood this day.

Davis, aged 19; Frank Lewins, aged 17; and Benjamin Green, sailor, John Street, Sunderland, had gone to the South Dock out let for the purpose of bringing a boat of theirs into the harbour, intending to use her for a pleasure excursion on the river next day. As they reached the bar it was dead low water, and there was about three feet sea just outside the pier. Henderson, who had charge of the beat, saw it would be dangerous to enter, and determined to return. For this purpose he was turning the boat, when a sea caught her broadside, and instantly filled her ; the next sea tossing the boat right over. All the five young men were immediately struggling in the water. Green and Lewins contrived to reach tho boat, which floated bottom upwards, and held on to it ; while the three other poor fellows struggled for a short time, and then disap peared iu the darkness of the night. The shouts of the poor drowning men were heard by two pitmen, who were fishing on the North Pier, and they alarmed Mr. Cornish, the light keeper, and some of the North Dock watchmen. A boat was immediately got, and rowed down between the piers, and rescued the two that were hanging on to the boat. The other three, of course, were drowned. Their bodies were afterwards found washed ashore on the beach near Sunderland.

About 2C0 gentlemen sat down to the repast, which was of a most recherche description, aud was furnished by Mr. Gray, of the Adelphi Hotel. The chair was occupied by the Mayor (James Morrison, Esq.), the guest ofthe evening being seated at his right ; and on the right and left of his worship were the Right Hon. T. E. Headlam, Esq., M.P., W. B. Beaumont, Esq., M.P., J. C. Stevenson, Esq., M.P., John Straker, Esq., Chairman of the Coal Trade Asso ciation ; the Right Hon. the Earl of Durham, J. W.

Reverdy Johnson), and a brilliant assemblage of ladies and gentlemen. The Rev. C. Hut chins offered up an appropriate prayer, when the mayor said, that after such an excellent beginning of the magnificent bazaar, which they were met that day to inaugurate, he thought very few words were needed from him. He congratulated them on the mag nificent sight before them, not only in the adornment of the room but in the ten times greater adornment of the ladies who were met there. The purpose for which they were assembled was one that elevated humanity ; and it was most cheering to think that so many people could be brought from their homes to assist in a work of noble charity like that. After a few more remarks, he introduced the American Minister, who, expressing the great pleasure it gave him to be present, said : \u2014 \" I was not aware that I should engage"], [47, "A.D. 1869.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 33 in the opening of this bazaar until yesterday. I was called upon yesterday to speak three times, and I more than fear that I have said ail that cau interest you. How a man can speak so often, so long, and have anything to say afterwards, puzzles me. Of all the institutions which man or woman can adopt, the one in which you are engaged, and for the advantage of which we are here assembled is, in the eye of heaven, as well as in the eye of man, tho most important \u2014 the education of children of both sexes.\" The Mayor then formally declared the bazaar opened. \u2014 Amongst those present at the opening were the ex-mayor (Mr. II.

We have a fine harbour, which has been very much improved of late by the River Tyne Commissioners, and now vessels of the largest tonnage can come in at all times of the tide. We have two extensive piers, and we have 36 feet of water at the entrance to the harbour at spring tides. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that we are a maritime town, and that the number of sailors produced in this neighbourhood is very great. The climate has had the effect of breeding up a race of bold, hardy, and enterprising sailors* Those sailors are to be met with in every clime, and in every country on the face of the globe. There are some very old sailors who now reside among us, and who fought valiantly under Lords Nelson and Collingwood, in the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar ; and I am sure it will warm their hearts to learn that the representative of the great Republic of the West is now an honoured guest amongst us.\" Addresses were then presented by the Town Clerk jfrom the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of Tynemouth ; one from the Chamber of Commerce ; and one from the Shipowners' Society ; after which His Excellency replied, and spoke as follows : \u2014 \" Mr. Mayor and gentlemen, the addresses which you have done me the honour to present I have not seen nor heard till this morning. It is not in my power to reply to them specifically, or, indeed, to notice many of the topics to which they advert. They all are animated by the same spirit, \u2014 that the ties of peace and friend should subsist between your country and my own. You may well be proud of this port and your river. One of your addresses says it is equal in depth and iu capacity for ships of every tonnage to any portion of Her Majesty's dominions. You might, with truth, have gone further, and said that it is equal in capacity to any river or port in the United States ; and, although you are not manufac turers, yet you are the owners of the ships, without which the manufacturers would be scarcely of appreciable value.\" After some further remarks, the proceedings terminated. \u2014 Immediately after wards, the American Minister proceeded to Tynemouth, where he was entertained to luncheon, at the Bath Hotel, by John Straker, Esq., the Chairman of the Coal Trade Association for the Counties of Northumberland and Durham. John Straker, Esq., occupied the chair, and Hugh Taylor, Esq., the vice-chair. On the right of the chairman was the guest of the day ; and, at the head of the table were, also, T. E.

Beverdy Johnson, and said .* \u2014 \" I feel it a great honour to be favoured with his company here to-day, and I am sure I speak the sentiments of everyone here when I say that we are all delighted to see him. Of the energy, skill, and ability of the great American nation all of us have the highest pos sible opinion ; but, if I may be permitted to say so, I think their government shewed peculiar acuteness when they invested His Excellency with the high office he holds, and sent him to this country. For, gentlemen, he has so deepened our feelings of friend ship for his nation, aud caused feelings of regard to arise for himself by his high-minded, straight-forward proceedings, and the good feeling he has, on all occasions, shown since he happily came among us, that, barring our honour, I think there is scarcely any sacrifice we would not make rather than go to war with America.\" \u2014 His Excellency the Ambassador responded in terms similar to those used on former occasions, and, after some other toasts, the company separated. \u2014 After leaving the Bath Hotel, His Excellency and a large party proceeded to the cliffs of Tynemouth, to witness the Life Brigade's operations, and means of saving life from shipwrecks. Having thrown a rocket across Prior's Haven, cradles were attached, and men were drawn backwards and forwards across the haven. Ax-x immense number of persons were present on the sea banks and pier ; the haven was crowded with boats, and the scene was of the liveliest description. At the conclusion of the exhibition, the American Minister paid a high compliment to the Life Brigade, and said : \u2014 \" Probably we may never meet again, but let me, therefore, wish you all success iu your honourable efforts, and bid you a kindly farewell.\" \u2014 The American Minister then proceeded up the river in one of the steamboats belonging to the Tyne General Ferry Company (the Harry Clasper), which had been decorated fer the purpose, and was liberally placed at the disposal of Mr. Johnson by her owners. Two of the directors of the company, viz. : \u2014 Mr. Edward Cranshay and Mr. John Rogerson, and, also, the secretary of the company (Mr. Frank Carr) were on board, and received His Excellency. The Mayors of Newcastle, Tynemouth, and South Shields, and a great many other gentlemen accompanied him on board. The progress up the river was a continued ovation.

Some workmen were employed in introducing iron girders in place of the timber ones, and when lifting one of tho huge iron ribs which span the arches, the chain snapped with which they were lifting it. The men were standing on the scaffold, which was erected about eighty feet from the ground, and when the chain broke they were all knocked down. One of the men rolled over the scaffold, and had it not been for a rope which by chance was hanging over the side, he would certainly have been killed. When he fell, the rope twisted round his leg, aud he hung in mid-air, the rope having formed a slip-knot round his leg, and so prevented him from falling. The men ou the scaffold were paralysed with the occurrence.

September 9. \u2014 A dreadful occurrence took place at Whitley, near Tynemouth. A man named John Dagmore, an engine fitter, had been engaged connecting some piping iu the well attached to the Convalescent Home, when Jane Hall, the Cook at the Home, asked him to draw her some water. She handed a can to him, and while he was lowering it to the bottom of the well, the rope broke, and the can fell into the water. At Dagmore's request, the cook returned to the Home for another can, and returned in a few minutes, but Dagmore was nowhere to be seen. She shouted, and receiving no answer, concluded he had come out of the well and gone to some other part of the premises. Nothing more took place till about an hour afterwards, when Dagmore's employer, wishing to give him some instructions, enquired after him. He was not to be found, and suspicion being aroused that he had fallen into the well, the porter of the house went down the shaft to the depth of 26 feet, when he was stopped by gas, but distinctly saw the body of a man lying at the bottom. He was drawn up again, and an alarm was instantly given ; when Thomas Scott, a man employed about the Home, came hurriedly up to the well, and, in spite of all that could be said to him of the danger he would incur, he insisted upon going down the well. The people at the top, naturally anxious to know how he was faring, called to him, but received no answer ; and, fearing that he had fallen to the bottom, the well was cleared of the gasses, and a young man, named John Rudd, a"], [59, "A.D. 1869.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 41 joiners apprentice, went down with a rope attached to him. On reaching the bottom of the well, he found the bodies of the two men, and succeeded in fastening ropes, by which they were brought to the surface. Several medical men arrived at the place in a short time, but the two poor fellows were quite dead. At the inquest, the jury returned a verdict that the deceased came to their deaths by inhaling carbonic acid gas.

September 13. \u2014 On Sunday night, at half-past nine o'clock, two prisoners, named Thomas Shield and Hugh Screenan, contrived to make their escape from Durham Gaol. The former was waiting his trial for wilful murder at Shield Row, Annfield Plain, committed in August last. It appears they had managed to make a hole in the wall of their cell, and so got out into the yard by means of their bedding and clothes, which they made into a kind of rope to let themselves down. Arrived in the yard, they had to get over an 18 feet wall, which they did by the help of some timber lying in the yard. The prisoner Shield was captured duriDg the night and taken back to Durham Gaol ; the other prisoner escaped. September 14. \u2014 The noble building erected at Whitley for the reception of the convalescent, and named the Prudhoe Memorial Home, was opened this day by Her Grace the Dowager Duchess of Northumberland, in the presence of a numerous and fashionable assemblage of noblemen, ladies, and gentlemen.

To our King we declare our grievance \u2014 from the father of his people we ask redress. With doubt and regret we have heard the declaration of our rector, Henry Phillpotts, doctor in divinity, that the tythe of his parish, affording a temporal remmmation for the services of its priest of four thousand pounds a year, is to be enjoyed by him, conjointly with the bishopric of Exeter, and the spiritual cure of twelve thousand in habitants delegated to a hireling. We humbly represent to your Majesty, that a parish so populous, paying so largely for religious assistance, might claim the advantages of a resident pastor ; we submit the utter impossibility of a bishop in Devonshire having the ability to discharge his duties in Dur ham ; we submit that prebendal stalls, and other religious sinecures, should alone be afforded to create revenues for the heads of the church ; we' declare the cure of souls to be a duty of eternal moment, which cannot be delegated without awful responsibility, which cannot be sacrificed to present consider ation without fearful daring of future account. We invoke your Majesty"], [61, "a.d. 1869.] remarkable events. 43 as the head of our church, graciously to consider our prayers ; and, if expedi ency should require the elevation of our present minister to the episcopal bench, that your royal prerogative may also secure to us a resident rector, whose undivided help may constantly be given in exchange for the secular advantages of this richly endowed benefice.\" September 23. \u2014 A melancholy accident took place this day, by which two men, named Spoors and Carr, lost their lives, by falling from a scaffold, at the new goods station, Newcastle on-Tyne.

The entrance hall of the Castle was converted for the time being into a gorgeous banqueting hall, being decorated with evergreens in truly Christmas character. The chair was occupied by the Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth, and the vice chair by Mr. Henry Wallace, the respected agent of the estate. The chairman was supported on the right by the Hon. H. G. Liddell, M.P., R. S. Newall, Esq., Gateshead ; J. M. Favell, Esq., Eighton Banks ; Rev. H. B. Carr, Whickham ; Rev. Mr. Brewsher, Birtley, \u25a0fee. ; and, on the left, by the Hon. A.

After the usual toasts the chairman pro posed \" The Tenantry,\" coupled with the health of T. Ironside, the oldest tenant of the estate, and, in doing so, said he felt it an honour to have his tenantry with him that day. He hoped they had all enjoyed themselves at the festive board, and in continuation re marked that a great deal had been said and sung about the duties of landlord and tenant, more especially iu the sister kingdom. He thought that a landlord had a right to look for a good tenant, and the tenant to expect a good landlord. A good tenant, iu his esti mation, was one who cultivated his land with industry, and who paid his rent with cheerfulness and regularity. He put his punctu ality in the payment of his rent, as a test whether that tenant was doing well or not on his farm. A man who did not conduct his farm with industry, and pay his rent with punctuality, could not do well. The first duties of a good landlord was to appreciate a good tenant, \u2014 to be willing to entertain his wishes, not to be ex acting in his rent, and to be ready to make allowances for the mishaps which might befall him. In fact, the duty of a landlord might be summed up iu the maxim familiar to them all \u2014 \" Love thy neighbour as thyself.\" He trusted none of them would be able to say that he preached what he did not practise. After alluding to other matters respecting his tenantry, he went on to say that many of their names were contemporary with his own \u2014 Ironside, Pattinson, Hall, Swann, and several others were names the mention of which touched a chord in his heart that vibrated through his physical and moral man. He remembered Mr. Iron side 40 years ago, when he served along with him in the Yeomanry, raised on the Ravensworth estates. He had great pleasure, there fore, in coupling his name with the toast. Mr. Ironsides briefly responded on behalf of his father, and proposed the health of the noble chairman, which was acknowledged by Lord Ravensworth. The chairman next proposed \"Agriculture and Commerce,\""], [65, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 47 coupling it with the names of Mr. Newcome and Mr. Newall, who replied ; and afterwards proposed the health of the Hon.

Mr. Fenwick replied. The chairman then gave \" The Press,\" coupled with the names of Mr. Redpath, of the Daily Journal, and Mr. Rutherford, of the Courant. Mr. Redpath replied. Mr. Wallace humourously proposed the toast of \" The Ladies,\" coupled with the name of the Hon. Miss Liddell, and the ladies of the House of Ravensworth. The Hon. H. G. Liddell responded. The proceedings were then brought to a close.

Atkin son, where every kind of steam joinery work, such as planing, moulding, veneering, sawing, turning, carving, sweep cutting, <fcc, was carried on. Damage to the amount of between \u00a312,000 and \u00a315,000 was sustained. A great deficiency in the supply of water was the cause of the fire being so destructive. February 23.\u2014 The Bellshields Estate, situated near ElsdoD, in the county of Northumberland, and containing about 436a., was sold by auction, and, after a spirited contest, was purchased by W.

At the coroner's inquest, the jury found that William Walton had murdered Ann Walton, and that he was in an unsound state of mind at the time. \u2014 In the case of the husband, William Walton, the jury returned the following verdict : \u2014 \" Died from injuries inflicted by his own hand, he being at the time in an unsound mind.\" March 3. \u2014 Mr. Joseph Pease, Darlington, presented a very handsome benefaction of \u00a3500 to the Newcastle Infirmary.

The sale was attended largely from London and the principal provincial towns, and must have realized a considerable sum. March 14. \u2014 This evening, a most brilliant audience attended the Tyne Theatre, to hear the Italian Opera Company. The principal artistes were Madlle. Titiens and Herr Wachtel. The opera selected was \" II Trovatore,\" and it was received with unbounded favour. The audience in full dress, in the lower circle, presented a gay and gorgeous picture, such as is rarely seen in the provinces. March 16. \u2014 One of the largest sales of landed estates in the county of Northumberland, that has taken place for many years, came off this day, at the auction mart, Token House Yard, London. The officiating Auctioneer was Mr. Samuel Donkin, and the estates offered for sale comprised in the aggregate upwards of 7,000 acres. The beautiful estates of Low Tre**hitt and Snittar, on the banks of the Coquet, comprising in the former 876 acres, and in the latter 330 acres ofthe very best possible land \u2014 whether for grain or green crops \u2014 were offered in one lot, and, after a most spirited competi tion, were knocked down to Mr. Wilkinson Creswell, for \u00a329,000. The township of Ulgham Grange, comprising the Grange Wood of 101 acres, noted for its plentiful supply of game ; the Grange Farm, of upwards of 422 acres, and Farney Beds Farm, of upwards of 314 acres, the whole comprising 863,348 acres of excellent farm land, all in a ring fence, and intersected by the main line of the North- Eastern Railway \u2014 was sold to Mr. Baker Creswell, of Creswell, for \u00a336,000.

K. Spark, Esq., of Darlington, who was the highest bidder at the sale, for \u00a313,300. April 2. \u2014 A coroner's inquest was held this day on the body of Charles Attwell, aged 24, a shoemaker, who died under peculiar circumstances. It appears that he complained of having a chapped lip, caused by the frost, and consulted a surgeon, who ascribed the"], [71, "ST iMREWS CHUTB.CH Ne-wcastle apan.Tyn.fc. .->*\"\u25a0* *1*1 1 I v\\ l.\\;; * c II A I'KI. - F.*,vr IS'n.e Taken down .Imm I '1.111"], [72, ""], [73, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 53 pain and inflammation to arise from poison in the wound. The deceased then remarked that he must have received it from a brass nail which he had been in the habit of putting into his mouth, or else from some poisonous matter contained in the leather with which he worked. After enduring great pain, he died ; and the doctor attributed death to Pyemia, brought on by a poisonous wound. April 5. \u2014 Died, at his seat, Felton Park, Northumberland, Thomas Riddell, Esq., aged 67, the representative of one of the most ancient and honourable of the county families of Northum berland. As a landlord, Mr. Riddell was popular ; his word was his bond ; and his attachments strong to the memories of genera tions upon his extensive estates. Few men have passed away with deeper feelings of gratitude, affection, and regret on the part of those who had to mourn his loss, as a landlord, a neighbour, and a friend to the poor. He was succeeded by his second surviving son, J. G. Riddell, Esq., of Oaksland, Hexham. April 6. \u2014 This evening, the remaining portion of the Chirton Estate was sold, without reserve, at the Commercial Hotel, North Shields.

April 1 2. \u2014 This afternoon, M. Niboyet, vice-consul of France at Sunderland, was presented with an elegant silver epergne by the inhabitants of that borough, as a testimony of their esteem for the manner in which he had discharged his duties as vice-consul for seven years. M. Niboyet received the appointment of first French Consul at Chicago, and left Sunderland for that port. April 16. \u2014 This evening, a public dinner was given to George Hudson, Esq., the \" Railway King,\" by the inhabitants of Sunder land, in recognition of his eminent and valuable services to the town and port of Sunderland. The dinner, which was a magnificent repast, took p'ace at the Queen's Hotel, Fawcett Street, and was attended by about eighty gentlemen including the representatives of the leading interests of the town. The chair was occupied by the mayor of the borough (Aid. W. Thompson), who was supported on his right hand by the guest of tho evening, and the vice-chairs were filled by F. Ritson, Esq., and R. M. Hudson, Esq. The usual routine of toasts having been proposed and responded to, the chair man proposed the toast of the evening, \" George Hudson, Esq,\" in a few complimentary remarks. Mr. Hudson responded, and dwelt at considerable length respecting his first connection with Sunder land down to the pi esent time, and the very many improvements and extensions made by railways and docks, for the benefit of com merce. April 25. \u2014 The marriage of C. T. N. Mather, Esq., at Longridge House, Northumberland, and Beech Grove, Newcastle-on-Tyne, to Miss Annie Liddell, only daughter of Edward Liddell, Esq., of Ben ton Park, Northumberland, took place this day, at Lady's Chapel, St. John's Wood, London. The sells of the parish churches rang merry peals during the day in hor.our of the event. April 26. \u2014 This morning, the marriage of J. W. Spencer, Esq., of Lemington Hall, Captain in the 1st Newcastle Volunteer Regiment of Artillery, to Miss Emily Berkley, daughter of the late Mr. Berkley, of Eland Hall, Ponteland, took place in Newburn Parish Church, and was witnessed by a large assemblage of the friends and relatives of the bride and bridegroom. There were"], [75, "A.D. 1870.] * REMARKABLE EVENTS. 55 great rejoicings in the village of Newburn. As early as one o'clock in the morning, a feu de joie of nineteen guns, from the battery belonging to the Newburn volunteers, was fired from an eminence over the village, and another was fired at five o'clock. The village was decorated from end to end with flags and streamers. There was not a single house without a banner of some description ; and at each end of the village was a triumphal arch. The path from the road to the church was covered with crimson cloth ; and the gay uniforms of the volunteers, the simple costumes of the school children, the wedding garments of the bridal party, and the cheer ful countenances of the large number of people assembled, seen in the bright sunshine of a spring morning, formed a most pleasing picture. April 26. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Bath Terrace, Blyth, aged 74 years, Mr. George Harrison, formerly captain of the Lady Jane whaling vessel, belonging to the Tyne, of which class of men there are now few, if any living. Deceased was born at Hartley in 1796, and was apprenticed on board the Leipsic, of North Shields, in 1809. Completing his apprenticeship at a time when the pres\u00bb gang were in full force, aud having a dislike, common amongst sea men at that time, to the royal service, he was compelled to resort to many expedients to elude their vigilaace. Many of his plans were well designed and cleverly carried out, but he had many narrow escapes before he succeeded in signing articles to serve on board an Arctic whaling vessel. After filling every station, he be came chief mate ; and, in 1827, obtained the command of the whaler Norfolk, of Berwick-upon-Tweed, in which vessel he was very successful for eight years, but was frozen up in 1835. He was also \" wintered\" ia the following year, a year of such unpara lleled severity as to make 1836 memorable in the history of the Greenland fisheries. A large proportion of his crew died ; and all suffered severely from privation and exposure. The result of these two voyages was disastrous to all concerned. The vessel was never again fitted out. Captain Harrison's services were at once trans ferred to the Lady Jane, owned by Matthew Plummer, Esq., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for the next ten years, at the end of which he retired from sea. Captain Harrison possessed an immense power of endurance and indomitable energy and perseverance. On one occasion, which occurred on his last voyage, during a terrific gale, when the Lady Jane was in extreme peril, Captain Harrison ascended the \" crow's nest,\" where he remained for seventy-two consecutive hours, and was only relieved to obtain three hours' rest, when he resumed his place for thirty-eight hours longer, until the ship was out of difficulty, and her passage safe. He was a large shareholder in the Union Joint Stock Bank (Chapman's) at the time of its disaster, and the whole of his hard-earned fortune was swallowed up in satisfying the claims of that unfortunate con cern. He was appointed harbour master at Blyth in 1847, which office he held until his death. His straightforwardness in business"], [76, "56 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1870. affairs won for him the respect of the maritime community visiting the port of Blyth. He was \" every inch a sailor,\" a \" hater of shams,\" warm in his friendships; and his kind disposition endeared him to all who were brought in contact with him. The writer has heard him state that he never saw a ripe gooseberry for twenty-eight years \u2014 meaning that he had been that length of time in the' Greenland seas during each summer. \u2014 \"When shall we look upon his like again 1 \" April 26. \u2014 A shocking accident occurred at the George Pit, Etherley, near Bishop Auckland, by which one man lost his life, and another was dreadfully injured. The unfortunate men named Parkin and Mr. Millan were employed drawing a \" judd\" in that part of the pit called the \" Bottomesis\" when, it is supposed, one of them had struck his pick into the top, and that stone and debris fell in upon them, burying them entirely up. Measures were at once adopted for extricating the sufferers, but it was not until after four hours' labour that McMillan, was released in a desperately exhausted state, being very seriously crushed and bruised. A strong force of men, and the whole of the colliery officials worked hard aud anxiously, but it was not until four o'clock in the morning \u2014 fourteen hours after the accident \u2014 that the body of Parkins was recovered. It was in a leaning position, and, of course, life was extinct. April 27. \u2014 Married, at Brinkburn Priory Church, in the presence of a large circle of friends and relatives, Alexander Henry Brownie, Esq., eldest son of Alexander Brownie, Esq., of Lesbury House, to Mary Isabel, eldest daughter of H. Cadogan, Esq., of Alnmouth. The bridegroom's wedding gift was a dressing case, in gold and crystal. Major Browne's presents to the bride were a set of dia monds, set in gold and blue enamel, and a tea and coffee service, in silver. The other wedding gifts included a great number of beautiful and costly articles, from relatives and friends ; and also a claret jug and biscuit box,, by the villagers of Lesbury. There was a grand ball in the evening, in honour of the occasion, and tea was provided the following day for the villagers. May 6. \u2014 The remains of Viscountess Boyne \u2014 who died at her town residence, Belgrave Square, London, on the 29th April \u2014 were interred this day in the family vault, at the south-east corner of the burial ground connected with Brancepeth church. Shortly after eleven o'clock, the procession issued from the castle keep. First came about 100 of the tenantry, who walked two abreast ; then a couple of mutes ; next, the plume bearer, attended by two pages ; and, finally, the coffin and mourners. Amongst the latter were, the Hon. G. A. Hamilton Russell (son of the deceased), the Hon. Charles Tennyson D'Eyncourt, G. S. Monck, Esq., (cousin of Lord Boyne), the Ven. Archdeacon Waring, W. A. Wooler, Esq., and F. Howard, Esq.

A large orowd assembled in the parish church, which was restored a few years ago by the deceased lady, at a cost of \u00a35,000. The outer coffin was covered with black silk velvet. The inscription was as follows : \u2014 \" Emma Maria, wife of the Right Hon. Gustavus Frederick, seventh Viscount Boyne, born 8th March, 1809; died the 29th April, 1870.\" The vault remained open during the afternoon, and was inspected by some hundreds of people. May 18. \u2014 William Jenkins, a picture frame maker, 59 years of age, living in Ridley Court, Groat Market, Newcastle-on-Tyne, com mitted suicide by hanging himself in his own house. May 19. \u2014 Messrs. T. and W. Smith, shipbuilders, North Shields, presented to the museum connected with the Tynemouth Free Library, two very fine models of Indian merchant vessels, built by them. In addition to their intrinsic beauty and value, the models illustrate the vast progress made in the construction of merchant ships, and represent the class of vessels whose route is by the Cape, and the Suez Canal. One of them is the model of the mer chant ship Blenheim, built in 1850, and to which was awarded a first prize in the exhibition of 1851 ; the other is a model of the Crosby, an iron screw steamer, launched from Messrs. Smith's yard in January, 1870. The models \u2014 especially that of the Crosby \u2014 have been executed with great elaboration, and extreme care and skill has been bestowed on the workmanship. Nothing is wanting ; and the nicety of proportion is remarkable. The stand of the Crosby is of mahogany, and that of the Blenheim rosewood, aud both models are enclosed in glass cases. May 26 \u2014 Married, at Benwell Parish Church, near Newcastle on-Tyne, by the Rev. Mr. Hall, Mr. Lloyd, of the 98th regiment, to Mary Henrietta Allhusen, fifth daughter of C. Allhusen, Esq., of Elswick Hall. There was a ball at Elswick in the evening, many of the leading families of the neighbourhood being present. May 27. \u2014 This afternoon, Mrs. Thirkell, an elderly lady, residing with her daughter, Mrs. Irvine, of Regent's Street, Hartlepool, whilst walking along the edge of the cliff, a short distance from her daughter's house, suddenly became giddy, and fell over upon the rocks beneath. She was picked up and conveyed home promptly, and the services of Dr. Rawlings were sought ; who, on examination, found that her thigh was dreadfully fractured, and she had also sustained other injuries, which caused her death shortly after. She was 75 years of age. June 18. \u2014 Died, Admiral Robert Mitford, of Mitford Castle, in the county of Northumberland, and of Hunmanby Hall, Yorkshire, at the ripe old age of 90 years. The family of Mitford is one of the longest standing in Northumberland. By the admiral's decease, the whole of the Northumberland and Yorkshire estates fell to Major John Philip Mitford, the grandson of the late Captain John Mitford, who was a brother of the admiral's father, Bertram ii"], [82, "58 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870.

July 5. \u2014 The admirable new schools at Percy Main, of which His Grace the Duke of Northumberland laid the foundation stone in September last, were formally opened this morning by Mr. Alderman Hedley. The schools, which form a portion of the scheme of school extension projected by the fourth Duke of Northumber land, are situate contiguous to St. John's Church, Percy Main, and are in connection with the Church of England. The project, which the lametned Duke Algernon did not live to complete, was taken in hand by his successor, and hence the schools are liberally endowed by His Grace as originally contemplated. The schools are fitted with every appliance ; play-grounds are attached, and everything that could be desired to render the building perfect as an educational establishment is provided. July 8. \u2014 A presentation of a handsome sum of money, which had been subscribed by the people of Newcastle, was made this evening, at the Queen's Head Hotel, to Mr. E. D. Davis, late lessee of the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, in appreciation of his character as a man and a citizen, and as a tribute for the admirable manner in which he had conducted that establishment for five and twenty years. A collation was provided on the occasion, at which the gathering of Mr. Davis's friends was very numerous, including Mr. Hugh Taylor, who presided, Mr. E. D. Davis, Mr. J. Cowen, jun., Mr. W. Cockburn, Lieutenant-Colonel Perkins, Birtley Hall ; Captain Hunt and Messrs. W. Punshon, Killingworth ; Councillor George Thompson, J. J. Harrison, John Dobson, W. T. Marshall, F.

Burrell, Broome Park ; D. T. Nightingale, R. Watkin, W. Foulsham, E. Smith, George Stanley, (of Tyne Theatre), Councillor Thos. Robinson, and J. S. Challoner. July 9. \u2014 This morning, about eleven o'clock, an accident oc curred at a large square block of new buildings which were being erected in Gallowgate, opposite the end of Darn Crook, Newcastle, which created a considerable amount of alarm and excitement in the neighbourhood, resulting in the immediate death of one man and the serious injury of a boy. A large cornice, which had been im properly fixed, fell with a crash, and Juried a man named Hewitson, and a boy named Rider, who, on being extricated, were found to be dreadfully mutilated.

This was the commencement of what may prove an extensive inland traffic from the Tyne. Owing to the limited facilities hitherto possessed by the commerce of the port, this class of trade had never been developed. July 12. \u2014 This morning, Henry Clasper, the veteran oarsman, died at his residence, the Tunnel Inn, North Shore, Newcastle-on- Tyne, after a short but painful illness, of congestion of the brain, at the age of 58 years. The deceased had been ailing for some few weeks, but had been able to attend to business. He gradually, however, became much worse, and was compelled to take to his bedroom ; but the illness was not considered by his wife and family to be very serious, and Mrs. Clasper therefore thought it unneces sary to call in the assistance of a medical man at that time. Convulsions having set in, Dr. May, the deceased's regular medical adviser, was at once sent for ; and, on his arrival, found his patient in a low, nervous state ; but the indisposition was not so serious, in the opinion of the doctor, as to cause alarm to the family and friends of the once-famous oarsman. He became considerably worse, aud, gradually sinking, passed quietly and peaceably to his rest, in the presence of his wife ; Mi s Eliza Kyle, Mrs. Strong, Mrs; Watertston, Miss Susannah Clasper, his daughters ; Mr. Robert Clasper, his son ; and Messrs. Davis aud Morrow, two old and intimate friends. On the 17th, the interment took place in the beautiful burying ground attached to Whickham Church, amid such a demonstration of popular respect and good feeling as is seldom accorded to any man. No sooner was it known that the noble old veteran had passed from the scene of his many triumphs, than a very laudable desire was expressed to do fitting honour to his obsequies ; and as Sunday was considerately selected for this purpose, in order more effectually to meet the convenience of the numerous bodies of working men with whom he had for years been on terms of the greatest friendship, it was naturally expected that vast numbers would be in attendance. Never for a moment, how ever, did the promoters of the ceremonial anticipate such a display as was witnessed on the occassion. The invitations extended to watermen and other supporters of aquatics were, as calculated upon, very generally accepted ; but, in addition to these, the townspeople themselves turned out en masse to show their regard for the hero of so many fights. Although the time for moving the body was announced for a quarter to three o'clock, the spectators began to assemble in the neighbourhood of the Tunnel Inn at least two hours previously, and established themselves on every eminence from which a view of the funeral cortege could in any way be obtained. A little before three o'clock the coffin was carried to the door, and conveyed on the shoulders of six stalwart men to the hearse. The pall-bearers \u2014 Mr. James Renforth, Mr. James Taylor, Mr. Thomas Winship, Mr. John MartiD, Mr. Thomas Taylor, and"], [84, "60 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870 Mr. Edward Winship \u2014 having ranged themselves on each side of the profusely-plumed hearse, the vehicle advanced a little in order to allow the relatives an opportunity for taking possession of the four mourning coaches provided for them. Everything being at length in readiness, the grand and impressive music of the \" Dead March in Saul\" was commenced by Stephenson's band, aud the procession then moved onward in the following order : \u2014 Local oarsmen and members of rowing clubs ; the hearse, containing the coffin ; first mourning coach, containing Mr. J.

Clasper, Mr. Robert Clasper, Master Henry Thomas Clasper (sons of the deceased), Mr. Robert Clasper, Mr. Richard Clasper, and Mr. Thomas Clasper ; second mourning coach, containing Mr. George Strong, Mr. John Waterston, Mr. John Waterston, jun., Mr. William Sadler (sons-in law ofthe deceased), Mr. Thomas Clasper, Mr. Robert Clasper, and Mr. Edward Clasper (nephews of the deceased) ; third mourning coach, containing Mr. Joseph Clasper, Mr. Joseph Snowball, Mr. Thomas Clasper, Mr. John Clasper, Mr. John Hawks (Walker), Mr. John Hawks, jun., Mr. Edward Hawks (Newcastle), and Mr. Ralph Grey; fourth mourning coach, cen- taining Mr. Robeit Snowball, Mr. Thomas Henry Ellis, Mr. John Clasper (Gateshead), Mr. John Hawks Walton, Mr. George Mid dleton, Mr. George Heiiry Walton, and Mr. Roger Middleton. Mourners three abreast. The following gentlemen, among others, joined the procession at Deiwenthaugh : \u2014 Mr. John A. Cowen (Bayden Bum), Mi. Richard Bennett, Mr. E. Martinson (Blaydon), Mr. Jamts Wilkinson, Mr. George Parker, Mr. Thomas Walker, Mr. Joseph Armstrong, Mr. Douglass, Mr. Wm. Lawson, Mr. J. Wilson, Mr. T. Daglish, Mr. J. Taylor, Mr. Isaac Johnson, Mr. James Duff, Mr. J. Bagnall, sen., Mr. J. H. Reed, Mr. Lance Jtbling, Mr. Thos. Heine, and Mr. Henry Gascoigne. Private carriage, containing Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun., Mr. R. B. Reed, and Mr. R. S. Bagnall, jun. Eighteen cairiages, containing gentlemen of the neighbourhood, the general public bringing up the rear, walking indiscriminately. The route taken by the procession was considerably changed from that which was at first proposed. It was originally intended to convey the body by the Quayside, Col- lingwocd Street, and Scotswood Road, thence across the Suspension Bridge to Swalwell, and so on to the church at Whickham ; but as it was at the last moment deemed more appropriate to convey it some part of the distance by water, arrangements for that purpose had rather hastily to be made. The thoroughfares to be traversed were Tyne Street\u2014 on a sloping bank, on which was situated the inn occupied by the deceased\u2014 New Road, Gibson Street, New Bridge Street, Grey Street, and Dean Street, and so on to the river, where the company were taken on board tug-boats to Derwent- haugh. From this place the path was over cinder heaps to Swalwell, and then by a long ascent leading to the west end of Whickham \u2014 a distance of seven or eight niles. Notwithstanding the great extent of ground to be traversed, the route was lined"], [85, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 61 with sorrowing spectators throughout, most of whom, despite the almost private life which Clasper led prior to his death, retained a warm remembrance of the virtues and achievements of the deceased. It was truly a grand and impressive sight to witness, and such, in fact, as poor Clasper never dreamt of during his life time. Not fewer than 100,000 or 130,000 persons took part in or witnessed the proceedings. On the procession reaching the Sand hill, it was seen that the people were so densely crowded as to render any further advance almost impossible. Strong detachments of police being brought to' the front, the obstacles were removed, and an opening made along the close to the Corporation Quay, where the body had to be removed from the hearse for conveyance over that portion of the old Tyne course which Clasper had for merly traversed so frequently to victory. The proceedings were closely watched by thousands of people who had assembed on the high and low bridges \u2014 both of which revealed unbroken lines of faces from end to end \u2014 and also by many others who had congre gated on the hill side, beneath the tower of St. Mary's Church in Gateshead, and upon the quays and wharves bordering both sides of the river. Many hundreds having been taken on board the steam tugs Louise Crawshay, Mary Jane, Joseph Cowen, Margaret, and the Prince of Wales, they proceeded, in the order named, towards their destination. Passing the end of the Mansion House, a hymn was wafted across the waters from a party of choristers who had stationed themselves on some timber at the river's brink. Tn due course the boats ran up to the qurys at Derwenthaugh, where Clasper spent many years of his life as a coke burner, and the body, being taken on shore, was carried over the dusty cinder heaps behind the ovens to the hearse in waiting on the road, the path being admirably kept by a party of Durham County police. The procession, on being re-formed, was here joined by the keelmen belonging to the Stella Coal Company, Messrs. Cowen and Co.'s works, and others generally employed at Stella, Blaydon, and Derwenthaugh, and was accompanied by them for the remainder of the distance. The procession reached the gates of Whickham Church precisely three hours after its departure from the Ouse burn. The prettily-situated churchyard was thronged wherever a view of the vast procession could be secured ; the church tower, from which, perhaps, along the whole route, the most extended and complete survey of the sight could be had, being also occupied by spectators. The people preserved the deepest silence as the funeral party entered the building ; and during the time occupied by the Rev. Mr. Taylor in reading the lesson, which he did with deep earnestness, with a clear enunciation, and in a manner calcu lated in a high degree to impress upon the large body of mourners a right and full appreciation of the solemnity and the reality of the service in which they were taking part, a mournful and devotional feeling appeared to pervade the whole congregation. The grave was reached with considerable difficulty, though, as far"], [86, "62 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. as possible, considering the density of the crowd, a path was made for the relatives and more immediate friends of the deceased. But few beyond those at the graveside obtained a glimpse of the coffin. Immediately the relatives departed, the grave was closed, and those who had hoped to have an opportunity of reading the inscription passed on to the adjoining graves, there to read, as hundreds did, the verses inscribed upon the skiff-shaped stone which marks the resting-place of his mother and his brothers : \u2014 \u25a0 Beneath this unassuming stone Lies one, when living, loved by all ; It's thus we dwindle, one by one, Obedient to our Maker's call. His little skiff, his sole delight, Is now deserted \u2014 ca t away ; His sculls he plied with skilful might Are all now hastening to decay. As friend, he was beloved by all ; As brother, none had stronger ties ; But now he's fled this busy world \u2014 He's safely moored beyond the skies. His match with time was ended soon, The stakes were handed o'er with tears ; His death has caused a sudden gloom, Which nought can dissipate but years. It was a gratifying fact that nothing transpired during the after noon that in the slightest degree interfered with the observance of due order and decorum. The utmost propriety of conduct was observed by every one ; few, if any, of the assembled thousands exhibited other than symptoms of sorrow and dejection, or uttered anything but expressions of regret at the loss of so well loved and respected a friend, and of sympathy with the relatives in their bereavement. The career of Clasper was an eventful one. He was born at Dunstan-on-Tyne, in the year 1812. While young, his parents removed to Jarrow, and there young Harry was sent to work in the pits. After a time, he returned to Dunstan, and worked as a cinder burner at the Garsfield coke ovens ; and, later on, when about 20 years of age, he became a wherryman for the same firm. From this period his aquatic career may be said to have commenced. At this time racing boats were heavy and un shapely, and the mechanical genius of young Harry was at once directed to their improvement ; and such genius and perseverance did he bring to his favourite pursuit, that it is a question whether his fame as an oarsman, or his renown as the inventor of the modern racing boat, is the greatest. One of his earliest attempts at boat-building was the \" Five Brothers,\" which he built at nights, after his day's work was done. In this boat, so appropriately named, the crew, consisting of Harry, William, Robert, Edward, and a younger brother as coxswain, he, for years, was victorious at the annual gala on tbe Tyne, commonly known as Barge Thursday. On December 18, 1844, his victorious career was interrupted, he being defeated by R. Coombes, in a skiff race on the Tyne for"], [87, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 63 \u00a3100 ; and in the year following, with his brothers, William and Robert, and his uncle, Edward Hawks, he won the champion prize of \u00a3100 ; and, for the first time, the Championship of the World was wrested from the Thames : one of the defeated crews being Robert Coombes, J. Phelps, T. Goodman, T. Coombes, and D. Coombes (coxswain). On the 29th September, he defeated Thomas Carroll on the Mersey ; and, on November 25, defeated W. Pocock on the Tyne, each match being for \u00a3200. Early in the following year, 1846, he was defeated on the Tyne by Robert Newall, in a match for \u00a3200. In 1848, in the celebrated St. Agnes, he and his brothers, with J. Wilkinson, again won the champion prize on the Thames. On the Tyne, in a match for \u00a3100, on the first day in 1853, he, with his brothers, were defeated by the celebrated Elswick crew, viz. : \u2014 Oliver, Bruce, Winship, and Spoor. On July 22, 1858, Harry won the Championship of Scotland, defeating Robert Campbell, on the Clyde, in a match for \u00a3200 ; and again defeated him, on October 6th, in another match for \u00a3200, on Loch Lomond ; but, on November 9th, 1858, he was beaten by Thomas White, on the Thames, in a match for \u00a3200. The races mentioned are but a few of his principal ones. He was engaged in several afterwards, but age began to tell npon him, and, meeting younger men, success did not crown his efforts, notwithstanding his great abilities as stroke in four-oared craft, in which he was generally victorious. July 12. \u2014 The first train on the Northumberland Central Bail way was run to day. The chairman of the railway, Sir W. C. Trevelyan, Bart., and a number of other railway officials, proceeded in a saloon carriage from Scot's Gap to Rothbury, the natural beau ties of the scenery on the route being greatly admired. \\ July 13. \u2014 At an early hour this morning the body of Mr. John J. Atkinson, the Government Inspector of Mines, was found quite dead at Lumley Thicks. Mr. Atkinson had attended a pic-nic at Lumley Castle, and left that place in his conveyance about half past nine o'clock for his home at Fence Houses. On reaching Lumley Park House, he called on Mr. Crawford, with whom he spent about an hour, and at eleven o'clock he again got into his convey ance to drive home. About one o'clock in the morning, John Ramshaw, miner, was at Lumley Thicks on his way to call the overman of the neighbouring colliery, when he saw Mr. Atkin son's conveyance, the horse standing quietly on the road, and the unfortunate gentleman lying with his head upon the road and his feet fast at the bottom of the vehicle. Having ascertained that he was quite dead, Ramshaw hurried to the house of Mr. Robson, viewer, to whom he communicated the sad news, and who at once proceeded to the spot, had the body driven to his house, and des patched a messenger to Lumley, for medical assistance. It was surmised that shortly after leaving Mr. Crawford's house, deceased had been seized with an apoplectic fit, under the effect of which he"], [88, "64 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. had fallen from the conveyance. The horse seems to have stopped at once, Mr. Atkinson's feet remaining fast in the vehicle. The body was afterwards conveyed to the house of deceased at Fence Houses, Mr. Robson and his wife accompanying it. The deceased had occupied the post of Government Inspector of Mines for the extensive district in which he lived for a period of upwards of a quarter of a century. His skill and general knowledge of the working aud ventilation of mines, together with the ability and energy with which he discharged the onerous duties of his post, had earned for him the confidence and respect of colliery owners and miners alike, and his genial manner and disposition made him a favourite with all classes. Mr. Atkinson was fifty years of age, and left a widow and ten young children to mourn his loss. July 14. \u2014 A little girl, named Catherine Casey, daughter of a hawker, living at Hartlepool, died in great agony, from hydrophobia, caused by the bite of a dog in June last. A few days prior to her death, she had appeared in the County Court, where an action was brought against the owner of the dog, aud damages obtained to the amount of \u00a330. July 17. \u2014 This morning, or on the preceding evening, a female convict, named Mary O'Neil, a married woman, 27 years of age, very cleverly succeeded in making her escape from Newcastle Gaol. At the sessions, held in this town in the latter part of June, she was convicted of stealing a purse, containing 12s., from the wife of a pitman, in Clayton Street, and was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, there beiug several previous convictions recorded against her. When the sentence was pronounced she said, \" Thank you ; that's not nice. It'll do me no good. I'll come back as bad as ever.\" On being removed from the dock she created a disturbance in court by screaming and crying \" Murder\" in the temporary cell in which she was placed. The court had to be cleared of auditors, among whom much commotion was made ; but her cries continued to interrupt the proceedings for a con siderable time, and she had eventually to be removed in a cab to the gaol. She was confined in a cell at the north-west end of the prison ; and by breaking an iron bar out of the window of the cell, she succeeded in reaching the wash-house, to which she could easily obtain access, and then, by getting out of a window, she had managed to climb on to the roof, which is nearly level with the boundary wall. She then fastened a piece of rope to the roof of the wash-house, and got over the boundary wall, a little above the entrance to the gaol, and opposite the Catholic schools ; but as the wall at this part is about twenty-five feet high, and the piece of rope she used only reached a few feet below the top, she must have fallen a great distance on to the flags below, and must, it is sup posed, have sustained some injury. She, however, succeeded in getting away."], [89, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 65 July 23. \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred in the park near Auckland Castle, this morning, by which a footman, named James Preston, in the employment of the Bishop, of Durham, lost his life. About five o'clock, Preston went out to shoot rabbits, in company with a fellow-footman. While traversing the park, he unfortu nately dropped his gun, which exploded, and the charge lodged in the back part of his knee. He was taken to the Durham County Hospital, but expired the .same evening. July 26. \u2014 This evening, the Mayor of Durham (Mr. Aid. John Watson) was presented with a handsome and valuable chain of office, subscribed for by the leading inhabitants of that city. The chain is of 18-carat gold, 44 inches long, and consists of a succes sion of open curb links entwined and surmounted by a scroll-leaf ornament. From the chain is suspended an elegantly-shaped shield of 18-carat gold, with arms azure, cross, or, enamelled in proper colours, and enclosed within a richly-ornamented scroll foliage bor der. The chain and badge were enclosed in a handsome Morocco case, fitted and lined with velvet and satin, and the articles are most chaste and beautiful specimens of the goldsmith's art. The presentation was made by Mr. John Coward, the treasurer, at the residence of the mayor in the North Bailey. Mrs. Mayoress was presented with a handsome gold bracelet, studded with diamonds and turquoises. July 26 \u2014 The will of Admiral Robert Mitford, late of Mitford Castle, Northumberland, and of Hunmanby Hall, Yorkshire, was proved in London by the testator's son-in-law, William Amhurst Tyssen Amhurst, the executor. The personalty was sworn under \u00a335,000. July 30. \u2014 A somnambulist, at Stockton, named William Leng, during one of his nocturnal peregrinations, fell from the top of a flight of stairs, and so severely injured his spine as to cause his death. Av-gust 4. \u2014 A very fashionable company was attracted to the pleasant Tyneside town of Corbridge, by a grand bazaar for the sale of useful and ornamental articles, held in the Infants' School room of that town. For many years past, the old parish church of this ancient town had been undergoing extensive repairs with a view to its entire restoration; and the churchwardens having ex hausted all the funds at their disposal, the bazaar was organized for the purpose of raising sufficient to complete the renovations, and more especially to provide the means of warming the church with Haden's apparatus. In order to carry out the latter work, it was necessary to strip off the greater part of the roof to \" sark\" it, which caused an outlay of \u00a3400. The bazaar was opened iu the morning by a prayer being offered up by the Rev. F. Gipps, M.A., Vicar of Corbridge, after which the Hon. H. G. Liddell, M.P. for South Northumberland, delivered an address. He congratulated I"], [90, "66 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870 them upon the good work in which they were engaged, and he hoped that the appeal made that day would be cheerfully responded to. He concluded by formally declaring the bazaar opened. August 4. \u2014 A new organ, erected in the north transept of St. James' Church, Morpeth, was formally opened by Mr. H. S. Oake ley, Professor of Music in the University of Edinburgh. The in strument was built by Mr. T. H. Harrison, of Rochdale, and its case, which is of stained pine, was so designed as in no way to interfere with the magnificent architectural features ofthe building. The cost was \u00a31,000, and from its size and quality of tone, it ranks as one of the largest and finest organs in the North of Eng land. August 5. \u2014 This evening, Mrs. Hayward, landlady of the Bush Inn, Oakwellgate, Gateshead, whilst in the kitchen, felt a flag on which she was standing move, and immediately with her hand caught hold of the top of the partition of the snug close by, and as soon as she had placed one foot on solid ground the flag fell down a well upwards of thirty feet deep. The place was formerly occu pied by smugglers, and it is supposed they had sunk the well for some purpose or other. August 6. \u2014 This evening, a fire, which lasted several hours and was attended with great destruction of property, occurred at the rag works carried on by Messrs. James M. Frank and Co , in con nection with Messrs. Robert Fraser and Sons, at the High Felling. The premises were entirely new, and the machinery with which the lower portion was filled was also all new. They were connected with the old grease manufactory belonging to the Messrs. Frazer, and the united works had a frontage of about 150 feet in length very near the river side, the grease works being at the west end, and terminating close to the steep gangway which extends from the High Felling steamboat landing stage to the top of the banks, a greater height than the roofs of the buildings immediately below. The works were closed at four o'clock in the afternoon, and when the workpeople had all left, Mr. John Fraser, as usual, spent about half-an-hour in examining the premises, but found no signs of fire and went away with the assurance that all was safe. Shortly after five o'clock, a woman who was passing the place observed flames issuing from one of the windows of the second storey at the north corner of the premises in question, which, as indicated above, stood at the east end and adjoined the grease factory. The woman at once raised the alarm, and the report of the fire spread with great alacrity, and soon brought together a large number of people. At one time, the new jetty leading from the Felling Colliery tramway, and standing at the river-side, was in danger, as were also some cottages near the east end of the building, but fortunately they sustained no damage. The occupants of the cottages removed their furniture. For upwards of two hours a great body of flame could be seen by people a good distance from the scene of the fire, and"], [91, "a.d. 1870.] remarkable events. 67 the banks and quays were crbwded with spectators during the whole of the evening. About seven o'clock the roof fell with a fearful crash, carrying with it the upper portion of the south wall. An hour afterwards the fire was so far subdued as to remove all fears of its extending to the grease works. The premises, stock, and machinery were insured, but not to the full extent of the loss sustained, which was between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000. August 8. \u2014 This morning, the Tyne Champion Four-oared Crew (Messrs. Renforth, Winship, Martin, and Taylor) left Newcastle on-Tyne to fulfil their engagement to row the St. John's (or Paris) four at Lachine, Canada, for a stake of \u00a31,000. About 300 per sons assembled at the Central Station to witness their departure, and loudly cheered the popular oarsmen as they set out upon their long journey. August 8. \u2014 This morning, about one o'clock, a man, named Thomas Rogers, about forty years of age, a mason by trade, who lodged at the Burns' Tavern, Spicer Lane, Newcastle, was aroused by some noise and got out of bed for the purpose of looking out of the window, to ascertain what was the matter. The bed stood on a level with the window, aud as he was looking out he unfortunately overbalanced himself and fell into the lane, a distance of about twenty-six feet. He w*as very seriously injured, especially on the head, and died in about an hour afterwards. August 8. \u2014 This evening, an inquest was held at Tynemouth, on the body of Mr. Samuel Barras, of Park Road, Newcastle, who died on the Long Sands between seven and eight o'clock. Mr. Barras had been bathing from one of Nixon's machines, and had not been long in the water before Mr. Nixon observed him struggling and floating in shallow water, and immediately made to his help. He succeeded in bringing him ashore, but at that time he was in a collapsed and apparently dying condition. Every assistance was got, and endeavours were made to restore animation, but Mr. Barras died a very short time after he was rescued from the water. He had evidently taken a fit. August 9. \u2014 There were great rejoicings at Cramlington, on the occasion of the marriage of Caroline Charlotte Augusta, youngest daughter of the late Mr. Edward Potter, of Cramlington House, to Dr. Wood, of Dunstan Lodge. Flags and banners were displayed in abundance. Admission to the beautiful church was allowed be fore the time fixed for the ceremony, and it was soon nearly filled by a highly-respectable assemblage. Among those present were Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Potter ; Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Burnett, J.P. ; Dr. and Mrs. Bourne * Dr. and Mrs. De Mey ; Rev. W. L. and Mrs. Rinch ; Mrs. Potter, Marine House, Tynemouth ; Mrs. Addison Potter, Heaton Hall ; Mrs. Sopwith, Allenheads ; Captain Briggs and Lieutenant Potter, Her Majesty's 67th Foot ; Mrs. Hind and family ; Dr. and Mrs. Skene ; Mrs. Cochrane, &c. The wedding"], [92, "68 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. party arrived at the church at eleven o'clock. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Dr. Hind, assisted by the Rev. W. S. Wright, M.A., St. Peter's, North Shields. At the conclusion, and as the party left the church, the organist played Mendelssohn's \" Wedding March.\" Dr. and Mrs. Wood, after receiving the congratulations of their friends, left en route for Scotland. August 15. \u2014 Mr. Henry Heavisides, author of the \"Annals of Stockton\" and other works, who died at his residence, Fenkle Street, Stockton, was interrrd in the Holy Trinity Churchyard of that town. The deceased was 79 years of age. His remains were followed to the grave by a large number of his friends, and several of the old inhabitants of the town and district. August 15. \u2014 A lamentable occurrence took place at Roker, near Sunderland, this morning, the victim being a young man named W. Landers, a pupil teacher at a Monkwearmouth colliery school. Landers and a companion named Stoker had gone to Roker Sands to have a morning dip, but the former having ventured beyond his depth, and not being able to swim, was seen by Mr. H. G. Abbs, who was upon the beach at the time, to be in distress, and strugg ling for life. Stoker had also by that time got beyond his depth, and narrowly escaped a watery grave also. Mr. Abbs, who is a Northern Circuit barrister, and son of Mr. Cooper Abbs, clerk to tho Sunderland magistrates, on seeing the heart-rending position of the young men, with great gallantry rushed into the sea, but Lan dei s had sunk to rise no more. * Laying hold of Stoker, Mr. Abbs with difficulty succeeded in getting him ashore, and restoratives from Rock Lodge, the residence of Mr. Abbs, being applied to him, he was slowly but surely restored to consciousness. The melan choly accident occasioned considerable gloom around the neighbour hood throughout the day. August 26. \u2014 The opening services of the new organ of the Rob inson Street Wesleyau Chapel, Sunderland, built by Messrs. Nichol son and Son, Newcastle, were held in that place of worship, Mr. Nicholson, on the occasion of its first public performance, presiding at the instrument. The eminent Wesleyan divine, the Rev. Thos. Vasey, preached an eloquent sermon, which was followed by a collection. August 26. \u2014 The death of Joseph Philip Robson, a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and a poet of considerable merit and reputation, took place this morning, at the age of 62 years. For a lengthened period he occupied a somewhat prominent position in the town \u2014 a foremost rank among men of letters \u2014 having been the author of many literary effusions, besides having contributed a characteristic local letter, under the pseudonym of \" A Retiort Keelman,\" to the columns of a weekly paper. This, with the published poems of Mr. Robson, rendered his name familiar amongst all classes in his native town. Mr. Robson was born in 1808, and spent the earlar years of his career as a mechanic, though he had been well educated,"], [93, "a.d. 1870.] remarkable events. 69 and, indeed, is said to have been an accomplished scholar. At a later period, he discharged the duties of a schoolmaster, in New castle * but in no capacity will he be remembered so well as in that for which his natural genius and his scholarship so admirably qualified him. And he was no less prolific than accomplished. His published works extend over a period of forty years, and include, besides poetical fragments, several poems of great feeling and beauty \u2014 some of them attracting, at the time of their appearance, the notice of several eminent contributors to that department of literature, of which he himself was no mean ornament. He first gave to the world his \" Wild Blossoms of Poesy,\" in 1832 ; but his ability was not fully recognised until the publication of his \" Poetic Gatherings,\" some seven years later. Amongst others of his pro ductions were, \"The Monomaniac,\" \"PoeticPencillings,\" \"Hermione the Beloved,\" and \" Evangeline, with Selections.\" As one capable of expressing his thoughts and opinions in the peculiar dialect of Tyneside, he stood almost alone, and to the cultivation and untiring exercise of that faculty, his fellow-townsmen are indebted for the many pleasing and clever lyrics and prose writings which so largely contributed to the reputation he earned, and which will live long after his departure ; and that his reputation has been well earned will be admitted by all who have ever experienced the pleasure, satisfaction, and edification which a perusal of his writings never failed to afford. August 2 7. \u2014 This forenoon, Mr. Deane, wool manufacturer, Durham, went to bathe at the Long Sands, Tynemouth, and had not been long in the water before he got out of his depths, and was in danger of being drowned. Mr. Ja3. Fry, one of the machine men, rushed into the water and swam towards him. Mr. Deane was lying with his face downwards, and in an apparently lifeless condition. Fry got him righted, and kept him afloat until a boat, manned by Messrs. Jas. Linklater and Robt. Nixon, the other machine men, came up, and in which Mr. Deane was conveyed on shore, where he was attended by Dr. Matthews, and was, through great exertions, brought round. August 31. \u2014 This afternoon, the ceremony of laying the corner stone of a new church, dedicated to St. Matthew, at Silksworth Colliery, near Sunderland, was performed by the Countess Vane, in the presence of a large and fashionable assemblage. The church, which is situated midway between the village of Silksworth and the colliery, is of early English Gothic character, built of lime stone, with freestone dressings ; contains free sittings to the number of 250, and cost \u00a31,800. September 1. \u2014 This evening, the west end of Newcastle was illuminated by a lurid glare, which appeared to have its origin in the neighbourhood of the Elswick Engine Works, and an alarming rumour to the effect that the immense engineering estab lishment of Sir Wm. Armstrong was being burnt down soon spread"], [94, "70 historical REGISTER OP [a.d. 1870. through the town. Many thousands of persons rushed off to the spot in an excited manner from all parts of Newcastle, as well as from Gateshead, from which town the light could also be seen. The glare, which had alarmed so many, was nothing but the blaze caused by re-lighting a furnace which had been out of blast. September 5. \u2014 This afternoon, the foundation stone of a new Wesleyan chapel and school was laid amid great rejoicing on a triangular site near the railway station at Jarrow. The building is calculated to accommodate from 800 to 900 persons, and its estimated cost was \u00a33,000. The ceremony of laying the first stone was gracefully performed by Mr. J. B. Palmer. September 9. \u2014 The Rev. Archibald Jack, of North Shields, died at an early this morning, in his eighty-second year. In 1819, Mr. Jack was ordained as the pastor of the Independent Church at Whitehaven. In 1834, he removed to North Shields, and he con tinued the minister of St. Andrew's Chapel in that tcftvn till about 1867, when age and infirmity led him to resign his charge. He still, however, resided in North Shields, and till within a few months of his decease preached occasionally in one or other of the chapels ofthe neighbourhood. Mr. Jack had been educated at the University of Durham, and at the Theological Hall in Glasgow. He was quite a scholarly man, and many young men, some of whom afterwards occupied high positions indifferent sections ofthe Church, were under his tuition. He was an able preacher, and excelled in the exposition of Scripture, as well as in plain, practical teaching. In the denomination of which he was an honoured member, he was held in the highest esteem by all classes. For upwards of twenty years he was the treasurer of the Durham and Northumberland Congregational Association ; and in 1857 he was elected chair man of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. He was, however, a man of very catholic and genial spirit, and was ever ready to fraternise with Christians of all denominations. His life was blameless, and not a few felt that in his death they had lost a true and wise friend. September 10. \u2014 This afternoon, a grand review of the volunteers of the counties of Northumberland and Durham, assisted by the men of the 98th Regiment, stationed in New*castle garrison, was held on the Town Moor, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and although under unfavourable circumstances, was a completely-successful military spectacle. The phalanx drew many to the scene of the day's operations, and with those who had assembled in advance for the sole purpose of obtaining a good situation, from which an uninter rupted view of the proceedings could be obtained, the attendance of spectatois, considering the threatening clouds and the dampness of tne ground underfoot, was exceedingly large, and gratifvino* to the promoters of the display. The grand stand, the stewards' stand, and the enclosure were open, and received a fair share of patronage, whilst many carriages were drawn up in line."], [95, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 71 September 1 2. \u2014 An extraordinary discovery was made in a house occupied by a Mrs. Armstrong, 96, Mainsforth Terrace, New Hen don, Sunderland. From information which he received, Detective Peacock proceeded thither, and questioned Mrs. Armstrong respec ting the inhabitants of her establishment, and said he wanted to see the woman upstairs. To this she stoutly objected, and finally said if the officer came back at one o'clock he might see her. The detective, however, would not leave, and said he would wait only a quarter of an hour longer. Within this time Mrs. Armstrong promised to bring her downstairs, and went up for the purpose. When she next came down, she was accompanied by a thinly-clad woman of haggard-like appearance, who, on being questioned by Peacock, stated that she had been confined and chained up in bed, and appeared to be giddy when exposed to the open air. The detective intimated to Mrs. Armstrong that he must at once see the bed room \u2014 a request which was reluctantly complied with. On getting into the bed room, the stench was so strong that he was at first obliged to beat a retreat. After he had overcome the effects of the loathsome smell, he observed the whole contents of the room comprised a narrow rude bedstead and a square broken box, which the harmless woman said was used to place her dinner upon. The window was nailed and immovably fast, and ropes were lying about the floor. It was stated that the woman had been there nine years, that her name was Mary Ann Hobson, and some annuity had been left for her maintenance. The woman stated she had been beaten and chained up in a state of nudity, and otherwise badly used. The necessary warrant was got, and she was removed to the Union. September 14. \u2014 Some stir was created in Darlington, on the occasion of the marriage of Mr. Thomas Briggs, son of Wm. Briggs, Esq., of Hylton Castle, Sunderland, High Sheriff of the County of Durham, with Miss Elizabeth Spark. The wedding party proceeded in above a dozen carriages from Greenbank, the beautiful residence ofthe bride's brother, Mr. H. K. Spark, to Trinity Church, where the marriage ceremony was performed. An immense crowd lined the inside and the entrance to the church. The bride, who was splendidly attired, as were also her bridesmaids, was given away by her brother, Mr. H. K. Spark. After the ceremony the wedding party returned to Greenbank, where festivities in cele bration of the event were continued during the day. September 14. \u2014 An accident, of an awfully destructive character occurred at Walker, by the explosion of a steam boiler, whereby four poor fellows lost their lives, and twelve or fourteen others were very seriously injured. The scene of the catastrophe was the iron works of Bells, Goodman, and Co. \u2014 better and more extensively known by the old title of Losh, Wilson, and Bell \u2014 and the manu factory, a very large one, is situated at only a short distance from the edge of the Tyne, and in close proximity to the Walker Alkali Works. This calamity\u2014 which occurred about four o'clock, a time"], [96, "72 historical register of [a.d. 1870. when there could not be less than 150 men engaged in the immedi ate vicinity \u2014 was not accompanied by anything more than a whizzing kind of noise, such as would be caused by an unusually large escape of steam, and heuce persons outside had but very little idea of the awful nature of the catastrophe for a considerable time after it had occurred. When the smoke and steam cleared away, however, aud the workmen had time to contemplate the full effects of the accident, such a scene of spoil and desolation met their gaze as is fortunately very seldom witnessed. The immense boiler had been lifted completely out of its bed, and broken and torn into fragments. September 15. \u2014 This afternoon, the great Anglo-Canadian four oared match between the Tyne champion crew, Messrs. James Taylor, Thomas Winship, John Martin, and James Renforth (stroke), aud the St. John Crew, Messrs. George Price, Samuel Hutton, Elijah Ross, and Robert Fulton (stroke), for \u00a31,000 and the championship of the world, was decided upou the broad waters of the St Lawrence, and resulted in an easy victory for the Newcastle representatives. Immense interest was manifested in the struggle. The question to be decided by the contest was one as to the utility of the different styles adopted respectively between England and America, viz. : the long, steady, sweeping stroke of the Tyne men, whose use of the footboard is so well known, in opposition to the straight-back, short, \" clippy\" stroke, and the rowing from the arms without much assistance from the feet of the St. John men, it being considered that the two fours were pretty equally balanced so far as stamina and experience were concerned. No aquatic struggle on record can compare with that of Lachiue, either in interest or in importance; for none has ever been projected on so imposing a scale, or exhibited in higher efficiency the moral and physical qualities which are essential to first-class rowing and to beneficial rivalry in sport. It w*as an honourable ambition that prompted the original challenge, and it was commendable self-confidence, founded upon a due appreciation of former victories, that led the oarsmen of the Tyne to do battle, under heavy disadvantages, for the honour of the country that gave them birth, and of the river which nursed them on her bosom. September 19. \u2014 The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of a new United Presbyterian Church, took place, amid great rejoicing, at Jarrow. The church, which is 82 feet long, and 54 feet wide, is designed in the pointed style of architecture, and has a spire at the south-west angle 130 feet high. The front of the building has a bold gable 55 feet high to the apex, with a five-light traceried window, below which is a group of doors leading into a central vestibule, on either side of which are the doors leading to the gallery staircase, one of which is in the tower ; along each side of the church is a series of three goblets over triple-light windows, the remaining side windows being formed of double lights, and has accommodation"], [97, "a.d. 1870.] remarkable events. 73 for 900 adults. The cost of the building was \u00a33,700, towards which Mr. John M'Intyre, of Heburn Hall, contributed the hand some sum of \u00a31,000. The ceremony of laying the stone was grasefuly performed by Mrs M'Intyre, after wbich there was a monstre tea party in the Mechanics' Hall. September 24. \u2014 This morning, the old mill at Kepier, near Dur ham, was burnt to the ground. The mill had been working over night, and Mr. Stonehouse, the occupier, was sleeping in an inner room of the place, while his son was left in charge of the mill stones. He had fallen asleep, and the feeding spouts having become empty, the stones grinding together caused the sparks to fly about, and as there were plenty of inflammable articles neir, it is supposed that some of those had caught fire. September 24. \u2014 Mr. James Neilson's hotel, erected by himself in Roker Gill, and largely patronised during the summer months by holiday visitors, was totally destroyed by fire. The house was of wood, and being plentifully seasoned with tar caused the flames to spread with alarming rapidity, to the amazement of its inmates. Everything apparently was safe on the previous evening, but early in the morning Mr. Neilson was roused by his dog barking. On getting up he discovered the room filling with smoke, and on reaching the staircase, found the latter all in flames. By this time the fire had reached the very bed upon which he had just lain, and with all haste Mrs. Neilson was got up and removed to a place of safety, not, however, before the hair of her head had been actually singed. September 27. \u2014 The Social Science Congress, holding their meet- ings in Newcastle-on-Tyne, were invited to Jarrow, to witness the launch of Her Majesty's iron-plated frigate Triumph, and to visit the works of Messrs. Palmer and Go. (limited), at Jarrow, on the river Tyne. The extensive publicity given to the fact that the launch would take place, combined with the fact that a number of the learned savans visiting Newcastle would be present, in addi- tion to the character of the Triumph, had the effect of drawing some thousands of strangers to the young town of Jarrow. Arriving at the works, where signs of rejoicing were seen on all sides, and a great profusion of banners added to the picturesqueness of the aspect, Mr. C. M. Palmer conducted the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, and a numerous party, over the fine Transatlantic emigrant screw steamer, Wyoming, which was lying nearly finished in the large graving dock, and the beautiful decorations of the handsome saloon, and the great size ofthe ship \u2014 her length being upwards of 380 feet, elicited much interest. The party were also conducted on board the noble war frigate Triumph, previous to the launch, and were also shown the other objects of interest in the works. At half-past three o'clock ',he horn blew forth the signal for a general cessation of work to those workmen not immediately con nected with the launches * for, in addition to the great launch at j"], [98, "74 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. about a quarter to four o'clock, a finely-modelled screw-steamer, for the Mediterranean trade, was launched from the slipways to the west of the Triumph. This steamer was named the Lord Alfred Paget, by Mrs. Moody, of the Vicarage, Newcastle. The dimensions of the Lord Alfred Paget were :\u2014 length, 222 feet ; breadth, 28 feet ; and depth 18 feet 7 inches. She is about 1,200 tons register, and was built for a London firm. Directly after the successful launch of this steamer, the company in the yard \u2014 which then numbered several thousands \u2014 made a move towards the great frigate ; but every precaution was taken to keep the general public from cro wd ing too closely round the bows of the ship. A semi-circle guard of the Jarrow Volunteer Engineers, under the command of Major Allison, kept the crowd back ; and their efforts were ably seconded by a numerous posse of county constabulary, under the charge of Mr. Superintendent Salter, of Jarrow, and Mr. Superintendent Squires, of Gateshead. Outside the yard every hill and point from which a view of the launch could be obtained were clad with people, who, in numbers, far exceeded the crowds on any former occasion. At the Howdon and Willington sides equally dense masses crowded the hillsides and the quay walls ; and on the river some steamboats in attendance had heavy freights of spectators. Soon after four o'clock active preparations were made by the strong band of work men attending on the frigate for the launch ; and all having been ascertained to be clear Mr. John Mclntyre, sen., under whose able superintendence the launch was, gave the signal for the last \" dog shore\" to be knocked out, and at ten minutes to five o'clock the huge, yet shapely, mass of wood aud iron began to move on the ways. Just as the Triumph moved, her Grace the Duchess of Northumberland, who was attended on the raised dais by Mr. C. M. Palmer, the Duke of Northumberland, and a brilliant company, calmly and gracefully broke a bottle of wine against the bows of the vessel, and christened her the Triumph, amid the enthusiastic cheers of the assembled multitude The bottle used in the ceremony was very tastefully decorated, and round the neck was a very handsome bouquet of rare artifical flowers. The Triumph moved slowly on the ways for the first few feet, but as her immense weight gained momentum, she glided into the water with great majesty. As she steadied herself in the midstream of the river, the spectators again and again rang forth loud and prolonged cheers, which were as frequently answered by the workmen on board of the floating frigate. The baud of the Jarrow Volunteer Engineers, as soon as the ways were cleared, played a few bars of \" Rule Britannia.\" The launch was in every sense a grand success, and loud were the congratulations which were paid to Mr. Palmer, and to Mr. Mclntyre, to whose long ex perience and skill the success of the ceremony was in no small degree due. Shortly after the launch, the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland left Jarrow for Alnwick Castle, by special train, but a number of invited guests adjourned to the large drill-shed belonging to the Engineers, where luncheon was provided."], [99, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 75 September 29. \u2014 A bazaar in connection with St. Paul's Church, at tbe north end of Darlington, was opened by Mr. Backhouse, M.P., in the Central Hall, amidst a good company. September 29 \u2014 A grand Masonic festival was held in Newcastle, to celebrate the installation of the Right Hon. Earl Percy, M.P., D.G.M.M., as Provincial Grand Mark Master for the Province of Northumberland and Durham. The installation ceremony took place in the hall of the Mark Lodge, Bell's Court, Newgate Street, which is also the hall of the Knights' Templars and Rosicrucians. The Mark Lodge of Northumberland and Berwick, is the oldest lodge in England. The hall had a fine appearance ; the beautiful banners hung in various portions, together with the heraldic bear- ings of the Knights' Templars, which included those of many celebrated personages who have distinguished themselves in the walks of literature, science, and art, giving a pleasing effect to the proceedings. It was expected that the interesting ceremony would have been performed by Earl Carnarvon, P G.M.M. of England, but, owing to unforeseen circnmstances, his lordship was prevented from participating therein. His place, however, was most worthily filled by Bro! W. Beech, M.P., P.G.M.M. of England, and P.G.M. for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The members of the lodges in the newly-formed province met at one o'clock, when the chair was taken by Brother Clapham, P.P.S.W. of Northumberland. The interesting ceremony was performed by Brother W. Beech in an exceedingly impressive manner, and in the course'of his address he alluded to the spread of masonry, and expressed his belief that the craft would be benefitted by the selection which it had pleased the Grand Mark Master to make in the appointment of Earl Percy to fulfil the duties of the distinguished office, inasmuch as his name was honourably associated with the province over which he was called upon to preside, and he felt sure that the brethren knew how to appreciate the Earl's sterling love for the craft. The office was one of considerable responsibility, and required great judgment, tact, and management, but he was certain, from his own personal know ledge, that Earl Percy would be able to discharge the duties in a satisfactory manner. October 1. \u2014 The fine old Border town of Alnwick was visited by their Royal Highnesses Prince and Princess Christian, and as this was the first royal visit with which the town had been honoured for a long time, much interest was manifested in the event. Their Royal Highnesses, who were the guests of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle, are known as Prince Chris tian, of Augustenburg, and Princess Helena, of England, the mar riage of the former with the latter having been celebrated on the 5th of July, 1 866. The visit of the Prince and Princess to Alnwick had been looked forward to by the people of the town with pleasant anticipation, and when it became definitely known that they had accepted the invitation of their Graces, a number of the more loyal"], [100, "76 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. and zealous of the residents of Alnwick at once set about arranging for a public reception of the royal visitors. With this object in view, it was intended to illuminate the town with gas, and decorate it with flags and evergreens. At the request of the Duke, however, this project was abandoned. It was understood that the Prince and Princess Christian, who had been staying with the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland for some time past at Dunrobin Castle, were to depart from Edinburgh by the mail train, which leaves that city at half-past seven o'clock, and reaches Alnwick at ten minutes past ten o'clock, and, accordingly, before that hour, a large number of ladies and gentlemen had assembled on the platform of the station, in the station yard, and on the road from the station down to Bondgate. Soon after the train which runs on the branch between Alnwick and Bilton on the main line had left the latter place at a quarter to ten, the gas over the gateway above alluded to was lighted, and a scene of excitement and animation ensued. The effect of the illumination was extremely pretty, lighting up as it did the entire station with a brilliant blaze, and bringing into view a large assemblage of ladies and gentlemen .After the gas had burned two or three minutes, it was suddenly turned out, the cause of this being a telegraph communication to the station-master to the effect that their Royal Highnesses having been unable to catch the half-past seven o'clock train from Edinburgh, would not leave that place till the departure of the next train at a quarter past ten, which was due at Bilton Junction at ten minutes to one in the morning. The effect of this intelligence was very disap pointing ; but as many present chose to consider it as a ruse adopted for the purpose of clearing a portion of the crowd from the station platform, nearly all remained till twenty minutes past ten o'clock, when the train by which the royal party were expected arrived. As, however, the train did not contain their Royal High nesses, most of those present went disappointedly away to their homes, though many, who had made up their minds to see the Prince and Princess, remained with that end in view. As time wore on, the sight-seers disappeared one by one, and when, at eleven o'clock, a message was received at the station to the effect that the train by which their Royal Highnesses were coming had just left Edinburgh, instead of having departed at a quarter past ten o'clock, and would consequently be three-quarters of an hour late, the num ber was very considerably reduced. At Bilton junction, a large crowd of persons from Lesbury and Alnmouth had also congregated, with the hope of seeing the royal couple pass at ten o'clock, but quickly left when it was found that they did not come. The train containing their Royal Highnesses arrived at Bilton at half-past one o'clock in the morning, and the two saloon carriages in which they and their suite travelled, being at the engine end of the train, were detached without delay and shunted on to the Alnwick branch. Whilst these operations were progressing, the passengers in the train left their places to get a view of the royal travellers,"], [101, ""], [102, "IBI 10s JL i^s !\u00a3 A__H__H'____'_f From"], [103, "5.

The train reached Alnwick station at twenty minutes to two o'clock, at which time a numerous party of sijjht-seers had re-assembled, and as the carriages were drawn alongside the platform a hearty welcome was given to the royal visitors in the loud and continued cheer which was raised. The Duke and Duchess of Northumberland were present on the plat form to welcome their Royal Highnesses. On arriving at the castle, they were met by the Earl and Countess Percy, Lord Algernon Percy, Lady Louisa Percy ; Earl and Countess Grey, from Howick ; Earl and Countess Tankerville, and Lord Ossulston, from Chilling ham Castle ; Lord and Lady Hatherton ; Mr. Charles Littleton ; Mr. William Littleton * Lord and Lady Charles Bertie Percy, and Miss Percy, of Guy's Cliffe ; Earl and Countess Eldon ; Mr. Charles William Orde, of Nunnykirk, and others. October 3.\u2014 This morning, between eight and nine o'clock, con siderable alarm was created in the Tyne Dock by the breaking out of a fire in the hold of the Surates, a full-rigged French vessel, which was discharging Esparto grass near to the entrance of the dock. An alarm was immediately raised, and in a very short time the pumps of the two Tyne Dock steamboats and three or four hose attached to hydrants on the quay jetty were got to play on the burning grass. The efforts of the brigade fortunately prevented the flames from bursting out and endangering the rigging of the Surates, or imperilling the safety of the adjoining shipping. At the first outbreak of the fire, the captain and crew of the Surates scuttled the ship to sink her, but after a time the holes were plugged up. During the whole of the morning dense sinoke and steam issued from the hold of the vessel as the grass '\u2022' smugged\" away, and the water poured on to it was converted into steam. October 4. \u2014 The Duke and Duchess of Northumberland gave a grand concert in honour of the Prince and Princess Christian, when, in addition to the Earl and Countess Percy, Marquis of Lome, Earl and Countess Grey, Earl and Countess Tankerville, Earl and Countess Eldon, &c, a very numerous portion of the respectable inhabitants of the town were present. The Duke and Duchess, together with the Prince and Princess, paid a morning visit to Sir Wiliiam Armstrong, at his residence, Crag Side, Rothbury. On the following days they visited Warkworth Castle, took luncheon in the keep of this grim old border fortress, and inspected the Hermitage, so celebrated from Bishop Percy's famous ballad, and saw many of the noteworthy objects in the vicinity ; and also went to Chillingham Castle, where they saw the unique herd of wild cattle, and the Earl of Tankerville attended them to point out whatever was worthy of their observation in Chilling ham Part"], [106, "78 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. October 4. \u2014 This morning, contrary to the expectations of the crew and the other passengers on board the ship, the Tyneside four (who had been taking part in the great Anglo-Canadian boat race) and their friends arrived in the Mersey. The crew found that they would just be able to catch the afternoon express to the North, and they decided to commence the journey to Newcastle without delay. At Thirsk, a large parly assembled in the railway station, and there was much cheering and enthusiasm. Mr. Hodgson presented Ren forth with a sovereign, in order that the crew might regale them selves, and drink his health. This is the same gentleman who made Robert Chambers a similar present on his journey home after beating Harry Kelly on the Thames. At Darlington, Ferry hill, Leamside, and Pelaw Main, parties also hastily gathered together in order to get a glimpse at the popular Tyneside cham pions. The train arrived punctually at half-past ten o'clock, and about 400 persons, who had been hastily apprised by telegram of the approach of the crew, were assembled on the platform to give them a hearty reception. The enthusiasm was most intense when Renforth's face was seen at the window of one of the second class carriages, and rounds of cheering greeted the gallant champions as they stepped on the platform. The whole of the men looked exceedingly well, and all were bronzed from the effect of the sea voyage. They repeatedly acknowledged the greetings which were given them on all sides, and it took them all their time to escape being mounted shoulder height by the excited spectators. Taylor, Winship, Martin, and Adams were successful in avoiding being thus handled, but Renforth was at once lifted from his feet aud carried out of the station to a cab, in which he and the other members of the crew were conveyed to Mr. William Blakey's, the Adelaide Hotel, Newgate Street. October 7. \u2014 Newcastle was honoured with a brief visit from two very distinguished members of the Royal Family of England, the Prince and Princess Christian ; but owing to the fact that their entrance was of the quietest and most unostentatious character, and that really very few people were aware of its occurrence, there was little of that warm enthusiasm and display with which the scions of royalty are greeted. Amongst the many excursions organised for their pleasure, during their visit to the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, was one to Sir William Armstrong's beatiful seat at Crag Side, near Rothbury. As a result of this very agreeable visit, it was decided that their highnesses be initiated somewhat into the mysteries connected with the manufacture of ordnance in the Elswick works. Sir William first conducted his guests to the handsome offices of the company, in one of which he had prepared a luncheon of the most elegant and princely character, and here, amid the fragrance of bouquets of flowers, an hour was allowed for rest and refreshment. At three o'clock, all being in readiness, the visitors, accompanied by Mr. Rendall, one of the partners in the Elswick Conrpany, proceeded to the ordnance departments. Here"], [107, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 79 they were shown the first stages in the manufacture of the celebrated \" Armstrong Gun,\" and had explained to them the uses and the difficulties of boring the barrels, turning the immense coils, regulating the breaches, and otherwise properly adjusting the many delicate and minute parts of the weapon. Sir William next con ducted his guests over the forge, where he hid oue of the red-hot trinion pieces for an eighteen-ton gun placed under the immense steam hammer, and also explained the process by which the heated metal of some portion of a gun barrel was contracted on to the cold metal of another. They were next shown the massive 600-pounder gun, with carriage complete, and were afforded a pratical illustra tion of the remarkably easy manner in which such a tremendous weapon could be wielded ; while in the foundry they had opportu nities for seeing how to cast the necessary shot and shell for the monster to belch forth whenever occasion might require. The last department traversed was that for the making of gun carriages, and here the royal couple were allowed to see in operation the now famous one invented by Captain Moncrieffe. The royal visitors, as indeed did the whole of the party, expressed their great gratification with what they had seen ; but as the time was fast approaching for their departure, they were compelled to abandon any further in spection. They returned to the North by the Scotch express, at five o'clock, their departure being witnessed by a large number of spectators. Advantage was taken of the above journey to New castle to obtain for the Princess a much-desired inspection of a Northumbrian coal mine. Her Royal Highness had so frequently referred to the shocking catastrophe at Hartley, and to the sym pathy which the Queen manifested for the sufferings of the poor men's families, that it was decided that she should pay a visit to Dudley, and there have explained to her the causes which led to the choking up of the Hartley shaft. The special train conse quently was shunted on to a siding, and the party were there re ceived by Mr. Potter and Mr. Johu Taylor, of Earsdon, and these gentlemen courteously pointed out the various objects of interest, and explained the working of the colliery. October 10. \u2014 A new organ was opened at the United Methodist Free Church, Crow Hall Lane, Felling, this day. The instrument, which cost \u00a3150, was from the estabbshment of Messrs. Nicholson and Son, of Newcastle-on-Tyne. October 11. \u2014 An unexpected and comparatively sudden death occurred at Alnwick Castle this morning. Lord Charles Bertie Percy had been residing at the castle for some days, and became somewhat indisposed, but not so as to create grave alarm. His symptoms gradually assumed a more serious character, and, in spite of medical advice, he became worse, and at half-past five this morning the attack proved fatal. Lord Charles, Lady Percy, and Miss Percy were the guests of the Duke and Duchess of Northum berland, and the sudden bereavement will be severely felt by all"], [108, "80 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. the members of the family. Lord Charles was born on the 24th of March, 1791, and was consequently in his 77th year. He was the youngest son of the first Earl of Beverley, and uncle to the present Duke of Northumberland. He was highly esteemed for the charity and benevolence of his disposition, and his death was extremely regretted by all who had the honour of his friendship. October 11. \u2014 This afternoon, the foundation stone of a new Masonic Hall, in Maple Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, was laid by Bro. George Thompson, P.M. of St. Peter's Lodge, P.P.G.S.W., and chairman of the company, in the presence of a number of the members of the craft. The building throughout is designed in the style of Gothic architecture ofthe 13th century. Bro. W. W. Smith, in presenting the trowel to Bro. Thompson, wherewith to lay the stone, asked him to accept it from the Masonic Hall Company, not only for the purpose of laying the foundation stone, but also as a souvenir from his brother Masons. He had the greatest pleasure in informing Bro. Thompson of the esteem in which he was held, not only by the members of the company, but by members of the craft from other places. They all knew the principles upon which the order was founded, but they were sometimes apt to forget one thing \u2014 their independence \u2014 and they should have continued to forget it if they had continued to rent a miserable room, as they had lately done. He had little doubt but that the Freemasons of Newcastle would be proud of possessing a freehold of their own, and he was quite sure that when the building was completed, it would not only reflect great credit on the craft, but it would reflect credit on its chief promoter, Bro. Geo. Thompson, whose untiring exertions and zeal had brought about such satisfactory progress. In conclusion, he presented Mr. Thompson with a silver trowel (which bore a suitable inscription), a mallet, and a square, in order that he might lay the stone in a business-like manner. After the removal of a white cloth, being an emblem of purity and virtue, Bro. Ludwig placed within a cavity in the stone a bottle, contain ing all the coins of Queen Victoria, and copies of .newspapers and documents, Mr. Thompson laid the stone amidst applause. Bro. Foulsham then offered up an impressive prayer, and Bro. Thomp- son having poured on to the stone corn, as an emblem of purity, wine, as an emblem of joy and gladness, and oil as an emblem of peace, Bro. Foulsham offered up another appropriate prayer. \u2014 In the course of his remarks, Bro. Thompson pointed out that almost every large town in England had a masonic hall, whilst in this large and flourishing town of Newcastle the Freemasons had no such place to call their own. He then alluded to the unsuccessful at tempts which had been made by the craft to obtain such a building, and stated that in the steps they had taken the St. Peter's and Northern Counties lodges stood out in bold contrast to the action of the other provincial lodges. When the hall was finished it would be complete and perfect, wherein Freemasons could meet to perform their rites and ceremonies in a quiet manner, which would add to"], [109, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 81 the solemnity ofthe proceedings; and, indeed, the brethren would find that the accommodation would be ample and sufficient for the whole province to meet in. He mentioned the obligations of mem bers of the craft, and concluded by adding, in the words well known to all masons, \" From the foundation that we have laid this day may we raise a superstructure which will be perfect in all its parts, and honourable to the builder.\" October 14. \u2014 This evening a very gratifying and well-deserved testimonial was presented to Dr. Bolton, in recognition of the valu able services rendered by him during the many years he was connected with the Infirmary as assistant-surgeon and house surgeon, at his residence in Westgate Street, Newcastle. The chair was taken by Mr. J. T. Pattinson, hon. secretary, and amongst the gentlemen present were Mr. R. Y. Green, secretary to the Infirmary, Dr. Pace, house surgeon, Mr. Ernest Biesterfeld, Dr. Walpole, Mr. J. Bell, Mr. J. M. Carr, and Mr. Thomas Cooke. The testimonial, which consisted of a handsomely framed illuminated address, a silver salver, and a purse containing one hundred and twenty sovereigns, was presented in a complimentary speech by the chair man on behalf of the subscribers. \u2014 Dr. Bolton, in a brief speech, returned thanks for their kindness. October 14. \u2014 This afternoon, an accident occurred at the ship building yard of Messrs. C. Mitchell and Co., Low Walker, which resulted fatally in the case of four men, and caused severe injuries to thirteen others. The yard of Messrs. Mitchell, in which a con siderable number of hands are employed in constructing iron ships, is situated at Low Walker, a short distance from the iron manufac tory and engineering works of Messrs. Bells, Goodman, and Co., where, by a remarkable coincidence, a calamity similar in its fatal results, occurred exactly a month previous, at nearly the same hour. The premises where the accident occurred had been extensively enlarged, a great addition to the building yard having been made by taking in a considerable portion of ground to the west of the original works. Upon the second slipway from the west side an iron screw steamer of about 1 ,500 tons burthen gross tonnage, intended for the French merchant trade, was in course of construction. The plates had all been affixed, and the shell ofthe vessel was complete, except the riveting of the keel. In order that the keel ofthe vessel might be the more easily got at, the ship was built; as is usual in such cases, upon certain blocks, which raised her some little distance from the ground. In the afternoon, about half-past three o'clock, a number of men were engaged beneath the keel, which they were rivetting, when some of the blocks above alluded to slipped from beneath the ship, and the hull being inclined, as all vessels are in course of construction, towards the river, slid gradually down stern wards for a distance of three feet, settling upon the ground, and crushing and multilating the men beneath her in the most frightful manner. There was an entire absence of any noise created by the K"], [110, "82 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. moving of the ship, which sank down quietly into the ground, and in such an easy manner that any casual passer by would not have observed any movement in the vessel, or that she was in any way other than in her proper position. The groans and agonizing cries of the poor fellows beneath the heavy mass of iron were, however, sufficient to alarm and arrest the attention of the whole of the men on the premises, who hurried at once to the scene of the disaster to render their services in extricating their brother workmen from their dangerous position. Considerable excitement was created, too, out side of the works, where several persons, hearing the piteous cries for help from the interior of the yard, raised the alarm, and a large number of men, women, and children at once flocked to the gates eager to render any assistance within their power. It was, however, found that the men were so tightly jammed against the earth and the blocks by the weight of the vessel that their extrication would be attended with considerable difficulty. Mr. John Crosier, the head foreman of the yard, lost no time in organising a band of wil ling workers, who, provided with spades and other implements, at once set about digging the unfortunate sufferers from beneath the keel. One by one the poor fellows were extricated from their im prisonment, and found to be more or less severely injured, some of them dead and some of them dying. No sooner were the men taken out from beneath the vessel then they were carried to the cottage hospital, where everything was done to alleviate their sufferings. October 24. \u2014 This afternoon, a bazaar was opened in the New Connexion Methodist Chapel, Scotswood. The original building in which the society worshipped was enlarged and beautified ; an organ was also put in, and a vestry added, the total cost of these improve ments being upwards of \u00a3500, and the bazaar was got up for the purpose of aiding the funds. The Rev. G. Grundy, who opened the proceedings, delivered an appropriate address. There was a good attendance of visitors, especially in the evening. October 24. \u2014 This afternoon, the foundation stone of a Wesleyan chapel, in connection with the chapel at Paradise, belonging to the Newcastle West Circuit, was laid by Mrs. W. C. Carr, in the pre sence of a considerable number of spectators. A silver trowel was presented to the lady who laid the stone. Short addresses were delivered by the Rev. T. Haslam, of Gateshead, and the Rev. Dr. Bruce, of Newcastle. The new chapel is a plain brick building, with accommodation for about 300 persons, and cost about \u00a3540. October 24. \u2014 A new Wesleyan chapel was opened, this day, at West Pelton. The style of the building is Gothic, with open roof, and for a country place, it is a spacious edifice, the interior fittings being of a superior character, the whole of the works having been executed from the plans gratuitously supplied by Mr. Storev. October 25.\u2014 This afternoon, The Cingalese, a screw-steamer built by Messrs. Schlesinger and Davis, of Wallsend, for Messrs. Thompson and Harper, of Newcastle, for the Eastern trade, via"], [111, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 83 Suez Canal, was launched amid great rejoicing from the above yard. A large number of ladies and gentlemen assembled to witness the launch, the christening being performed by Mrs. Thomas Harper. October 25. \u2014 A remarkable display of aurora borealis was wit nessed this evening in Newcastle and the neighbourhood. The horizon from east to west was spanned by a broad zone of rich crimson colour, presenting the appearance of a reflection from some great fire. There were also visible at intervals long lines of white and yellow light, fading into cerulean blue, with a tinge of green. The spectacle altogether was such as had not been witnessed in this district for many years, and large crowds were attracted by the extraordinary phenomenon. From their deep roseate hue, these lights have on Tyneside been traditionally associated with the Earl of Derwentwater, by whose name they are popularly known, a simi lar exhibition having appeared in the heavens on the night preceding the execution of that hapless nobleman. Meteorologi cally, the phenomenon was indicative of an approaching magnetic storm, and the truth of this theory was borne out by the post-office that telegraphic communication had been disturbed by atmospheric causes. As to the origin of this phenomena, one of the simplest suggestions is that they are \" no more nor less than the moisture in some shape (whether dew or vapour, liquid or frozen), illumi nated by the heavenly bodies, either directly, or reflecting their rays from the frozen masses around the Pole, or even from the immediately proximate snow-clad earth.\" A much older speculation regarding the aurora is the conjecture hazarded by Halley, 1700, that it is a \" magnetic phenomenon;\" and Faraday's discovery of the evolution of light is said to have raised this idea to the rank of an \" experimental certainty.\" October 26. \u2014 This afternoon, at the commencement of the Manor Court ofthe Duke of Northumberland, held in the Northumberland Arms, North Shields, nearly all the gentlemen of the legal profession were in attendance, and Mr. Lietch, the Town Clark, presented, in the name of the profession, an able complimentary address to Mr. Law*s on his appointment to be steward of the court for the manor of Tynemouth, in the place of Sir Walter B. Riddle. October 27. \u2014 This afternoon, a fine iron screw steamship was launched from the yard of Messrs. C. M. Palmer and Co. (Limited). The vessel was christened the \" C. M. Palmer\" by Mr. R. Welford, secretary to the Tyne Steam Shipping Company. Her dimensions are : \u2014 230 feet over-all, 220 between perpendiculars, 16 feet depth of hold, 906 tons builder's tonnage. October 27.\u2014 The handsome new Wesleyan Chapel, recently built in the Front Street, Tynemouth, was opened. The style adopted for ;the building is the Rennaissance, which appears admirably adapted for street architecture, and the stone selected for use (Prudham) enables full effect to be given to the chaia.teristic features of the style. Accommodation is provided for 717 adults."], [112, "84 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. The cost of the new chapei was about \u00a33,200. The services were commenced with a prayer meeting, held in the forenoon ; and, in the afternoon, the Rev. John Rattenbury, of Nottingham, preached to a crowded congregation, amongst whom were many of the leading Wesleyans in the district. The interior of the chapel had a very handsome appearance when filled with the large congregation. There was a good choir, and the service was very impressive. October 28. \u2014 This evening, a number of gentlemen assembled at the house of Mr. Thomas Burn, Lambton Arms Inn, Chester-le- Street, for the purpose of presenting Mr. Alexander Hope with a handsome lever watch and appendages, as a recognition of their appreciation of his services as secretary of the Chester-le -Street Farmers' Club, a position which he had held from the commence ment of that society. On the outside of the inner case was en graved the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to Mr. Alexander Hope, by the members of the Chester-le-Street Farmers' Club and friends, in recognition of his services. July, 1870.\" October 29. \u2014 The fifth series of orchestral concerts, under the auspices of Mr. Wm. Rea, was brought to a satisfactory conclusion this evening, when every portion of the Town Hall was densely packed by a delighted and appreciative audience. The programme was selected with as much care as on any previous night, and the pieces were faultlessly given by the admirable body of musicians brought together. At the conclusion of the National Anthem, Mr. Rea was greeted with several rounds of hearty cheering from the audience, and, in response, stepped to the front of the platform, aud tendered his most sincere thanks to the subscribers and the public generally for the support which had been accorded to him in his undertaking. November 1. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Biddick Hall, near Fence Houses, at the age of 90 years, Mr. Henry Morton, agent to the Earl of Durham, of Lambton Castle. The deceased was a native of North Northumberland, having been born in the year 1780, his father being a farmer in considerable circumstances. At a suitable age, he was sent to the High School of Edinburgh, and had for schoolfellows such men as Francis Jeffrey, Brougham, and others of that brilliant galaxy of genius which some years after shed such a lustre over the society and literature of the Modern Athens. At the High School, it is stated, young Henry Morton did not display those high mental qualities which afterwards distinguished him, but was considered a somewhat dull and stolid youth ; he was a strapping young fellow physically, however, and was great in those bodily exercises then so much in vogue. After having gone through the usual routine the young man returned home to Northum berland, and shortly after married Miss Culley, the daughter of a scion of the ancient family of that name located at Copeland and Fowberry, and set up for himself as a farmer near Belford. Mr. Morton had a strong leaning towards sheep-keeping as a paying"], [113, "Un) Scat m' MX ullpr iKsriT C HIL-LUN- C1L-VM r || I * K ( * I I Noiih *!"], [114, ""], [115, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 85 department of farming. This preference he never lost, and on his first commencement on his own account he stocked his pasture lands extensively with a well-selected flock of sheep, and made pre parations for carrying on this kind of grazing on a large scale. His great administrative abilities, active habits, and complete know ledge of the science of farming as it was then practised, attracted the attention of several influential men in the county of Northum berland, and a vacancy occurring in the number of the agents employed in the management of the estates and mines of Mr. John George Lambton, of Lambton Castle (afterwards the first Earl of Durham), such representations were made as secured the post for Mr. Morton. This change in his sphere of action occurred about the year 1822, and from that period until the closing of his mortal career, his fortunes were linked with those of the house of Lambton, and he laboured for it with an ability and assiduity rarely equalled. His early fondness for sheep-farming always clung to him, and he laid out a large tract of the Lambton estate for the breeding of that description of stock, stoutly maintaining that it was more profitable than cattle-grazing. When the model farm near Houghton-le-Spring was established, all experiments with new breeds of sheep, improved methods of management, improved farm machinery, manures, tfec, were tried there previous to innovations being made upon the customary method of the estate, and the best results followed. In his mining policy, Mr. Morton showed a singular amount of foresight and power of estimating the effect of circumstances acting upon the value of the mineral with which the Lambton lands were so rich. A thorough free-trader, his mind grasped the idea of the mighty extension of commerce which would result from the breaking of the fetters which shackled the inter course of nation with nation ; he early foresaw the power of steam, and the great change effected in the coal trade by the construction of the railway systems of England and the Continent, the estab lishment of ocean steamships, and the extensive use in manufactories of machinery driven by steam power did not find him unprepared. As years wore on, and steam navigation improved, the plan of screw-colliers for the supply of the London and Continental demand for coal was conceived and put into practice. Mr Morton quickly reasoned out the correctness of the idea, and embarking in it soon made the Lambton fleet of screws a very important item in the sailing and arrival of vessels at the port of Sunderland. In all the contested elections for the Northern Division, and for the town of Sunderland, since he filled the managing place at Lambton, he was actively concerned on behalf of the Whig candi dates, and was valued as an excellent canvasser. He was especially prominent in securing the return of Lord Howick for Sunderland in 1841, and his exertions are described as having been unremitting on this occasion. But a fine trait of character which was always visible when dealing with matters political did not fail him even in this juncture. It is told of him that, although he was most assidu-"], [116, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. 86 ous in canvassing the Lambton tenants on such occasions, yet that no man could take a refusal better. If he secured the vote asked for, well and good, it was added with a smile of approval to the list already compiled in his book ; but if a firm refusal met his solici tations, no ill-temper or disappointment was visible, and he was never known to remember such a thing against a tenant or make reprisals of any kind. He walked with a very erect gait, and in spite of his weight and size was a capital horseman, and very fond of horse exercise. Many a tour across the Lambton estates would he make on horseback, starting at an early hour in the morning, and attentively observing everything round about him. When in health he was always an early riser, and enjoyed these rides very much. In dress and manner he was unpretending, and there was nothing of the \" great man's great man\" about him. If his advice was sought by anyone connected with the estate, or by any of the local bodies, the stores of his knowledge and experience were freely opened. Under such circumstances he was always courteous, and attempted to solve the difficulty placed before him, as if the mere act of dipping into his well-arranged mental resources was attended with that pleasure which is felt on finding in au emergency the very thing required in the exact place where it was stored for use long before. November 1. \u2014 An inquest on the body of Hannah Robson, whose death by drowning, it was alleged, was caused by Thomas Keeney, on the morning of Sunday, the 23rd October, was held this after noon, at the Town Hall, Gateshead, before Mr. Coroner Favell. The evidence was to the effect that Keeney was seen in company with the woman, and was also seen to push her into the water. A verdict of wilful murder was returned. November 2. \u2014 A new Wesleyan chapel at Throckley was opened this day by the Rev. Thomas Vasey, of Sunderland, chairman of the district, who preached in the afternoon and evening to crowded congregations. The building occupies a commanding site on the north side of the turnpike road from Newcastle to Corbridge, &c, and forms a prominent object for some distance in either driving on the road or passing along the railway to Carlisle. A free grant of the fee-simple of the land was made by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The chapel consists of a nave and east aisle ; at the south end of the latter is placed the porch with bell turret. A considerable number of the seats are free, though no difference is made in their appearance from those which are intended to be appropriated. Sittings are provided in the nave for 186 adults, and in the aisle for 19 singers and 40 children\u2014 total, 245. November 2.\u2014 The Rev. Dr. Cathcart, minister of the English Presbyterian Church at Harbottle, having accepted an appointment from the London Religious Tract Society as one of their Associa tion Secretaries, was presented with a gold watch and purse containing \u00a325 11s."], [117, "A.D. 1870.} BBMARKABLE EVENTS. 87 November 3. \u2014 A serious accident occurred this day, on the Lon donderry Railway, between Seaham and Ryhope Dene, through the practice of riding on the waggons, which seems to have been pursued by lads belonging to Sunderland. Two youths of eighteen, named Wilson aud Scott, in attempting to jump on tho laden set, fell and were run over. Wilson was killed on the spot, and Scott so much injured that one arm had to be amputated shortly after. November 3. \u2014 This morning, as the s.s. Alice, a trader between the Tyne and Grangemouth, was entering the Tyne, she struck a pilot coble, containing three pilots, and cut her in halves. The men were precipitated into the water, and before assistance could be rendered one of them, named James Stewart, was drowned. November 9. \u2014 In accordance with the requirements of the Muni cipal Reform Act, the election of Mayors and other officials took place this day in the various corporate boroughs throughout the country. In Newcastle, the proceedings partook of more than usual excitement, from the contests which took place for the offices both of Chief Magistrates and of Sheriff. The candidates for the former position were Mr. T. L. Gregson, and Mr. R. B. Sanderson, and the choice eventually fell upon the latter gentleman by the narrow ma jority of one, the number of votes being\u2014 for Mr. Sanderson, 27, and for Mr. Gregson, 26. For the office of Sheriff, the gentlemen nominated were Mr. C. F. Hamond, and Mr. W. Daggett, the vot ing resulting in the election of Mr. Daggett by the large majority of 36 against 17. In the other towns in this district the civic honours were distributed as follows : \u2014 Gateshead \u2014 Mr. J. M. Redmayne ; North Shields \u2014 Mr. G. Bell ; South Shields \u2014 Mr. J. M. Moore ; Sunderland \u2014 Mr. W. Nicholson Durham \u2014 Mr. Aid. J. Ward * Stockton \u2014 Mr. Joseph Richardson ; Hartlepool \u2014 Mr. C. Neilson ; Darlington \u2014 Mr. Kitching ; Morpeth \u2014 Mr. Alderman Duncan. November 10. \u2014 This evening, the town of Alnwick was visited by a heavy storm of thunder and lightning, when twenty-seven sheep, the property of Mr. John Potts, of Cockhill, near Morpeth, were killed by the electric fluid in the midst of the storm, while grazing on Alnwick Moor. November 10. \u2014 A man named Miles Prior was ground to death in a mill at Whessoe Ironworks. Deceased was in the act of taking a shovel from another man and being the strongest of the two suc ceeded, but the sudden jerk caused him to fall backwards into the mill, and before the steam could be shut off, he was crushed to death. November 11. \u2014 Died, at Taganrog, in the sea of Azof, Mr. Walter Vazeille Temperley, eldest son of Mr. T. C.

He was an engineer on his first voyage, and the weather being cold, the engineers had made a fire on in the cabin, when the ventilation being defective, they were found suffo-"], [118, "88 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1870. cated ; two of them were brought round, but young Temperley was unfortunately dead. A beautiful memorial cross was erected to the memory of deceased in St. Cuthbert's Church, Bensham. November 12. \u2014 This afternoon, the Mayor of South Shields (Mr. J. M. Moore) presented to Mr. Benjamin Herron, a member of the South Shields Volunteer Brigade, an honorary bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society, awarded to him for his courage and humanity in having saved the life of John Baines from drowning, at South Shields, on the 15th of August, 1870. November 12. \u2014 This day, the eldest son of Mr. Hugh Taylor, of Chipchase Castle, came of age, and, in accordance with old custom, there were great rejoicings at his patrimonial halls. Salvoes of seventeen guns were fired in front of the mansion. The tenantry, about sixty in number, dined at the castle. . November 13. \u2014 -This morning, an extensive and destructive flood occurred at Tyne Dock, by which nearly 100 families were in the early hours of the morning washed out of their houses. The heavy rains had caused the culverts and watercourses leading from the west and south of Tyne Dock to be surcharged with water, and shortly after midnight the rush of water down from the higher levels of the Tyne Dock district became much too great and rapid to be carried away by the ordinary channels into the dock and river. The consequence was that the roadway at Templetown \u2014 the South Shields and Jarrow turnpike \u2014 which lies at a rather low level, began quickly to be covered by congregating streams of water. The water rose with such astonishing rapidity that before any adequate warning had been given, the whole of the pit cottages, some thirty-four in number, situate ou the south side of the turn pike, were flooded up to the depth of about three feet. Most of the inhabitants were in bed, and their attention was roused by hearing the furniture in the rooms floating about, and by the see thing noise of the fires \u2014 the pit people, according to the customs of the trade, having their fires on all night \u2014 gradually being put out by the swiftly rising water. In these cottages the alarm created was great, and the condition of the inmates most pitiable. They were compelled to remain in bed and see the water gradually rise until in many instances it reached the level of the bed itself. They had no escape, for on the roadtvay the water was even deeper than in the houses. After a time, the news of the flood reached the people residing above the roadway, and soon after the assistance of some carts and a boat raft was obtained to rescue the poor people from their deluged homes. In one of these cottages, a poor woman was lying ill of fever, and had to be taken out in the dark, bleak morning in a cart. In another of the pit cottages a young boy was also lying on a low bed, and the water rising to his couch, ha had to be rescued in a similar manner. As the morning advanced, the accumulating waters increased, and spread westward along the road until they reached the first archway above the high"], [119, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 89 Tyne Dock entrance, extending along the road a distance of nearly half a mile, and along the entire distance the houses conti guous to the road, together with the post-office at Tyne Dock, were also flooded, and a considerable amount of damage done. The stables and out-housss in connection with the Tyne Dock were inundated, and Mr. Bell, the horse-keeper, whose house was also flooded, had, after escaping out of the back of his house, to take the horses out of the stables to a safer part of the dock. Mr. Bell kindly aroused Mr. Spark and his family, who reside next door ; and Mr. Spark's son, on rising out of his bed, and hearing Mr. Bell knocking, was considerably alarmed when he found himself, instead of stepping upon the floor, standing up to the knees in water. Mr. Spark and family had to be taken out of their house by the back windows into the Tyne Dock, and that could only be done by the aid of planks aud some friends. The damage to Spark's house was considerable, the drawers, sofas, beds, and other articles being all flooded. The passengers by the morning trains for the dock were unable to pass the road to get into the dock, and had to be conveyed across in cars and by means of planks. The mail bags from Pelaw to South Shields had to be taken into the dock and proceed down the inside to the lower entrance. The roadway until the after part of the day was completely impassable to foot passengers, and for a later period for vehicles also, and when they were compelled to venture on the road the water came over the floors of the car riages. During the day the scene was thronged by thousands of people belonging to the neighbourhood. Holes were broken in the boundary wall of the Tyne Dock, and by night the water was al most run off the roadway. November 13. \u2014 Mr. R. B. Sanderson, the Mayor of Newcastle, accompanied by Mr. Daggett, the Sheriff, Mr. J. H. Ingledew, the Under-Sheriff, and most of the aldermen and councillors of the borough, together with a majority of the Foreign Consuls in the port, attendee! Divine worship in St. Nicholas' Church, when a col lection, amounting to \u00a364 6s 6d , was taken in aid of the funds of the Infirmary. \u2014 The Mayor (Mr. J. M. Redmayne), and many of the members of the Gateshead Town Council, attended St. Mary's Parish Church, as also did the Gateshead Rifle Volunteer Corps, under the command of Captain Clephan, when a collection was made in aid of the Infirmary, the Gateshead Dispensary, and the Convalescent Home, which realised the sum of \u00a355 I Os. 4d. \u2014 The Mayor of Tynemouth (Mr. George Bell), with the aldermen and Town Council of Tynemouth, the River Tyne Commissioners, with the 1st Northumberland Artillery and band, and a number of Free Gardeners, marched in procession from the Town Hall to Christ Church, where a sermon was preached on behalf of the Dispensary. In the evening, his Worship and the members of the Corporation attended St. Peter's Church, where a sermon was preached on be half of the local charities. \u2014 Mr. J. M. Moore, the Mayor of South Shields, with the aldermen and town councillors, went in proces- L"], [120, "90 HISTORICAL REGISTHR OF [a.D. 1870. sion to St. Hilda's Church, where a sermon was preached on behalf of the Dispensary of that town. \u2014 The Mayor of Stockton (Mr. Joseph Richardson) entertained the members of the Corporation and a large number of friends to breakfast in the Borough Hall. Amongst those present were Mr. Joseph Dodds, M.P. After break fast, a procession, headed by the mayor and aldermen, was formed, and the party, numbering nearly 300, proceeded along the High Street to the parish church, and attended Divine worship. \u2014 In ac cordance with the time-honoured custom, the Mayor of Hartlepool (Mr. C. Neilson) invited the members of the Council, the borough and county magistrates, the corporate officials, and a numerous circle of private guests to breakfast at the Cleveland Hotel. About seventy gentlemen were present, who afterwards marched in pro cession to the church. \u2014 Mr. N. Nicholson, the Mayor of Sunder land, attended Divine service at the parish church, Church Street, Sunderland. November 16. \u2014 The funeral of Mr. Byrne, whose memory is so intimately associated with the noble organisation for the rescue of seamen from shipwreck established at the mouth of the Tyne, took place this afternoon, at North Shields. It was attended by the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade, and detachments from the South Shields and Cullercoats Life Brigades, and a uumber of the men belonging to the Coast-guard service. The body was carried on a gun carriage to the Roman Catholic Church, where service was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Gillow, and from thence it was conveyed to the old cemetery, where the interment took place. November 17. \u2014 This afternoon, about half-past two o'clock, a frightful and fatal accident occurred on the railway at Wylam Station. It appears that Captain Walker, Adjutant ofthe North umberland Administrative Battalion Rifle Volunteers, who had to inspect the Hexham Rifle Volunteers, intended proceeding from Newcastle by the ordinary train leaving the Central Station at a quarter before two o'clock ; but it started before he arrived at the station, in consequence of which he went by a special train, consist ing of an engine and first-class carriage. The special left Newcastle at twenty minutes past two. A horse and cart were standing beside the warehouse at the Wylam Station, but off the line, and the driver, on observing the train coming towards the station, took hold of the horse's head. Mr. Gustavus Townsend, the stationmaster, who, it appears, was not aware that there was a special running, left the station for the purpose of crossing the line just as the train was pas sing, when, unfortunately, he was knocked down and run over. He was dreadfully injured, and died about twenty minutes after the accident. The deceased, who was very much respected, was about 40 years of age, and had been stationmaster about two years. He left a widow and several children. November 18. \u2014 In the Newcastle County Court, a case, which excited great interest, was heard ; it being a petition by Mr. Joseph"], [121, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 91 Arundale Grainger to liquidate his estate by arrangement or com position. Mr. Meynell opened the case by saying that he appeared to move, on the part of Mrs. Grainger, the wife of Mr. J. A. Grainger, a debtor, a notice of motion to the effect that Jane Davison Grainger might be declared to be entitled to the proceeds of a certain sale by auction of certain goods and effects, or some part thereof, which were in and about a certain messuage or dwel ling house called Jesmond Dene Hall, in the borough of Newcastle, late in the occupation of Joseph Arundale Grainger, and which sale was held on the 19th, 20tb, and 21st days of October last, and that the trustee, receiver, or manager of the estate might be ordered to pay the same to Jane Davison Grainger, and further that the said Jane Davison Grainger might be declared to be wholly and truly entitled as against the trustee, or receiver, or manager' of the estate to certain goods and effects which had been claimed by the trustees as part of the estate, which were now in the possession of Mr. Charles Brough, auctioneer. \u2014 Mr. Meynell then read the affi davit of Mrs. Grainger, which stated that she was married to her husband, Joseph Arundale Grainger, at St. Paul's Church, High Elswick, on the 18th of July, 1868, and that previous to her mar riage a certain deed of settlement, in consideration of her marriage with him, dated the 2nd day of July, 1868, between Joseph Arundale Grainger on the first part, herself on the second part, Charles Thomas Naters Mather on the third part, and Edward Liddell on the fourth part, was made and executed. By this deed of settlement an annuity of \u00a3500 and two principal sums of \u00a39,000 and \u00a313,498 Is. Id. were transferred to the hands of Edward Liddell and Charles Thomas Naters Mather as trustees of the settlement to pay the dividends and annual proceeds to her during her life for her separate use, and free from the control or enjoy ment of her then intended husband, and every after-taken husband. By this deed it was recited that the deponent was possessed of certain plate, jewels, and trinkets, and that in view of her intended marriage these were agreed to be settled to her separate use. It was also agreed that any after-acquired property should also be settled. Amongst other things the same deeds witnessed that in pursuance of the above agreement, and in consideration of the intended marriage, Joseph Arundale Grainger did covenant and agree with deponent, by the name of Jane Davison Mather, that all jewels and trinkets belonging to her immediately before the solemnization of the intended marriage, and that any real or personal estate to which during the intended coverture she should by gift, bequest, succession, or otherwise, become entitled to should be held and enjoyed by her, her heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, free from the control and enjoyment of her husband. She also affirmed that her husband contributed nothing towards the settlement, and that the whole so settled was her own proper moneys and effects ; whilst the fourth paragraph asserted that numerous gifts were made to her on her marriage which formed"], [122, "[a.d. 1870. 92 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF part of the furniture sold. In the month of October, 1868, deponent and her husband agreed to take and furnish Jesmond Dene Hall, and in order to raise sufficient money for that purpose, it was agreed that she should raise the sum of \u00a31,500 by way of mortgage on her separate estate, her husband undertaking, in con sideration of her doing so, to settle the articles purchased with the \u00a31,500 upon her. Deponent and her husband lived together at Jesmond Dene Hall after it was furnished till the Wth of September last, prior to which date she had frequently requested him to settle the furniture upon her, which he refused to do. She then became aware that her husband was in insolvent circumstances, and was threatened with proceedings, in consequence of which, and of personal ill-treatment which she had received at his hands, and the illness which she suffered in consequence thereof, she was advised by her medical attendant to reside at Tynemouth. Having heard that her husband had filed a petition for arrangement, she caused notice of her marriage settlement, and her claim to the whole of the furniture, to be served upon Mr. J. G Joel, solicitor, on behalf of the receiver, and she affirmed that, notwithstanding such notice, the furniture was sold on the 19th, 20th, and 21st October last. Various articles given to her on her marriage were sold, but prior to, and in contemplation of, the sale, she directed various things which she considered her property by virtue of the deed of settle ment to be removed from Jesmond Dene Hall and deposited with Mr. Charles Brough auctioneer. Mr. Grainger had made answer to that affidavit by another, in which he admitted the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs in his wife's affidavit, but declared that the date in the latter paragraph, instead of being December 31, 1868, was December 31, 1869. He admitted making arrange ments for furnishing the house, and his wife raising the sum of \u00a31,500, but stated that the money was paid into his banker, that be drew generally from the account to furnish and keep up the house, and that only a portion was expended in the furnishing of the house, the other part being expended in carrying on the establishment. He denied that he ever undertook to settle the articles purchased with the \u00a31,500 on bis wife. In the beginning of 1870 his wife asked him to consent to the settlement of the household furniture upon her, which he declined to do, as himself and wife had contracted a large amount of debt, which he had no prospects of paying except out of his wife's private income. The amount of debt contracted by his wife far exceeded that raised by her. Owing to the personal extravagance of his wife, a large amount of debt was contracted * and on the 8th of September, and not the 14th, as sworn to by his wife, she, without any just cause, and against his express wish, ceased to live with him, and went to live at the Bath Hotel, Tynemouth, taking with her a very large sum of money. Deponent also affirmed that he never ill-treated his wife, but that his wife had frequently used violence to him. Mr. Blackwell, for the defence, denied many of the asser-"], [123, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 93 tions in Mrs. Grainger's affidavit, and submitted a number of cases bearing on the law of the matter for his consideration, and went on to say that it was evident, from the fact that Mrs. Grainger removed a large amount of plate, linen, and such articles as were generally needed to set up a second establishment, that she left her husband permanently, and did not intend to return. His Honour reserved his decision. December 3. \u2014 A daring attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Thomas Blair, farmer, Dean House, Mitford, and local steward on the Mitford estate, while on his way to Morpeth in the middle of the day. It appears that Mr. Blair had been in the habit of regu larly going to Morpeth on business matters in the forenoon on Saturday, and this morning he was fired at from behind the wall on the south side of the road, about a hundred yards east of Middle Ford, or Abbey Mill Bridge, and nearly opposite to the well known mineral well. On the west of the bridge he had met and conversed with Mr. Thomson, traveller for Mr J. Jobling, spirit merchant, and Mr. J. Swan, Morpeth. Hearing the report of a gun, they turned round to see the object of the shot, and to their surprise they saw Mr. Blair without his hat, his horse plunging and finally wheeling round and making for home. Suspecting something wrong, they went toward Mr. Blair, whom they found bleeding profusely from the head. He told them he had been shot from behind the wall. On going back for his hat Mr. Thomson saw a man with a gun in his hand running up the field, whom he called upon to stop, charging him with having shot Mr. Blair. He heeded not, but ran on, and laying the gun on the bank, threw himself into the mill-dam of the Abbey Mills. Mr. Thomson assisted Mr. Blair home, while Mr. Swan hastened to Morpeth for Dr. Rose. Mr. R. Herdman, who had also been a spectator of the scene, raised an alarm, which drew the attention of two road-men and the Messrs. Ashton, of the woollen manufactory. After a delay of about half an hour, they succeeded in finding the body, but life was extinct. It was found to be that of Samuel Smith, about 70 years of age, who formerly had been in Mr. Blair's service, and through whose influence, as steward, had been latterly a labourer on the Mitford estate, occupying a cottage' not far from Mitford Church. He afterwards lost his employment, but continued to reside in the cottage till he received notice to quit. Mr. Blair's condition was not regarded as dangerous, and he recovered. It appeared that the deceased had purchased the gun that morning, little more than an hour and a half before the melancholy occurrence, at Morpeth. The affair produced a startling sensation among the people of Mitford, where deceased had borne a good character all his life, and also in Morpeth, where Mr. Blair is well-known and respected. December 3. \u2014 The sinking of an extensive colliery, said to be one of the largest in the South Durham coal-field, was completed by the Shildon Coal Company. Tho undertaking, which is called the"], [124, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. 94 Shildon Colliery, is situated in close proximity to theShildon Station, on the Darlington section of the North-Eastern Railway. The two shafts are 14 feet and 12 feet respectively in diameter, and were commenced on the 29th of June, 1866. December 6. \u2014 This morning, at about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, a collision of a most frightful character, and followed by fatal results to five persons, occurred close to the Brockley Whins Station on the Sunderland and South Shields branch of the North-Eastern Railway. The following are the names of those killed \u2014 Frederick Younge, manager of the \" Caste\" Dramatic Company ; W. B. Ogden, chemical manufacturer, Deptford ; Henry Y. Richardson, Wear mouth, paper manufacturer, Deptford ; R. C. Tnrnbull, commission agent, Sunderland, and agent to Messrs. R H. Tweddell and Co., Herbert Tapley, guard of passenger train. About forty other pas sengers were very much injured. At the coroner's inquest the jury returned the following verdict : \u2014 \u25a0\u25a0*' We are unanimously of opinoin that Frederick George Younge, Herbert Tapley, Henry Yearker Richardson, Wm. Bernard Ogden, and Robert Crowherst Turnbull came to their deaths, on the 6th of December, 1870, by a coal train running into the express train, at Bockley Whins, on the North- Eastern Railway, caused by Robert Hedley haviDg omitted to place the points right, and that it was an error in judgment on the part of the said Robert Hedley. We wish further to remark upon the impropriety of Adamson, or any other person, being allowed to remain in the pointsman's cabin, and so take his attention from his duties, which are of so much importance. We also recommend that proper signal-men be forthwith appointed to replace each other at proper hours.\" The Coroner then called Hedley before him, and ex plained that after the jury had considered the case fully and seriously, they were of opinion the catastrophe had been brought about by an error of judgment, and not from any wilful intention to do injury. Owing to this verdict, there was, as far as the coroner's court was concerned, no need for his detention, but as the police had very properly apprehended him, it would now be their duty to take him before the magistrates, by whom, however, a discharge would no doubt be granted. The jury, whilst taking this view of the matter, had expressed their opinion that no person ought to be allowed to go into any pointsman's cabin for fear of unnecessarily attracting his attention from his duties ; and this remark had been made in consequence of an impression, although not fully proved, that Adam son had been in the cabin a long time prior to the accident, and that he had probably gone there for the sake of a little idle conver sation. This was felt to be an entirely indefensible procedure, as such conversation would undoubtedly have a tendency to take the pointsman's attention from his duty, and so risk the lives aud safety of people who were constantly travelling along the railway. December 9.\u2014 This afternoon, the remains of Mr. Frederick G. Younge, who was killed in the fearful railway catastrophe at Brock-"], [125, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 95 ley Whins, were interred at the Elswick Cemetery, Newcastle. It was the desire of the friends of the deceased that the funeral should be of a strictly private character, and, consequently, the obsequies were conducted without any parade or unusual display. A stormy day aided materially in securing the privacy desired, but, in spite of the wind and rain, about 1,000 persons assembled in the Central Station, Newcastle, to demonstrate their respect for the unfortu nate gentleman by being present when the funeral procession arrived in this town. Immediately after the holding of the inquest, the body was removed from the railway station at Brockley Whins to the Roker Hotel, Roker, where Mr. Younge and a portion of his company had been staying. The widow of the unfortunate gentle man, accompanied by Mr. Frank Younge, one of his brothers, and Mrs. Richard Younge, arrived from London shortly afterwards. The terrible nature of the blow to Mr. Younge's family circle may be imagined from the following incident. The brothers, Messrs. Frederick, Richard, and Frank Younge, had for years been sepa rated by wide tracts of sea and land, Australia, England, and America having been the scene of their respective wanderings at different times. A short time previous to the lamentable affair, Mr. Frank Younge arrived in England from Australia, and for the first time for a very long period the three brothers found them selves in this country at the same time. To celebrate the occasion, it was resolved that during Christmastide the \" Caste\" company should be treated to a holiday, and that the brothers should hold a great family re-union, in which they might enjoy the unwonted pleasure of each other's society without let or hindrance. How terribly the dream was dispelled. It having been determined that the interment should take place at Newcastle, arrangements were made for the conveyance of the body and a party of mourners by the two p.m. train from Monkwearmouth. This train was due at Newcastle at a quarter to three, and at that hour the public plat form of the Central Station was crowded with people, awaiting in silence its arrival. By order of Mr. Reed, the station-master, the train was shunted to the main platform, instead of into the usual siding, and the coffin, which was of plain varnished oak, with brass name plate and bosses, was taken from the luggage compartment of the carriage in which it had been conveyed. Meanwhile, the gentlemen taking part in the obsequies had assembled in the sta tion-master's room, and, taking their places as the body was lifted from the carriage, the procession moved from the platform in the following order : \u2014 Bidders : Mr. Frank Stokes and Mr. Henry For tune (both members of the \" Caste\" company). The body, with pall-bearers : Mr. J. W. Ray, Mr. Craven Robertson, Mr. George Stanley (of the Tyne Theatre), and Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun. Chief mourners : Mr. Richard Younge and Mr. Frank Younge (brothers ofthe deceased), and Mr. William Gold and Mr. Henry Gold, who are cousins of the Messrs. Younge. The other mourners included Mr. H. P. Grattan, Mr. S. Dyneley, and Mr. Dixon (\"Caste\""], [126, "[a.d. 1870. 96 historical register of company) ; Mr. W, Reeve, lessee ofthe Scarborough Theatre ; Mr. J. W. Kimber (stage manager), Mr. F. H. Watson, Mr. G. Murray, Mr. H. H. Vincent, and Mr. T. B. App'eby, of the Tyne Theatre ; Mr. W. H. Swanborough, Mr. W. B. Spong, and Mr. Morrean, of the Theatre Royal, Newcastle; Mr. Wm. Bencraft, Mr. John Kirtou, Mr. Geo. Lambton, Mr. J. T. Gilmour, Mr. Messenger, &c. Several of those present in the Central Station had witnessed the performance of the deceased when a boy upon the Newcastle stage, and of his father, Mr. Richard Younge, then leading actor of the company, and, as might be expected, deep emotion was visible on all sides as the body was borne through the crowd. A hearse with four mourning coaches and six cabs awaited the procession under the portico of the Central Station, and every thing being in readiness they at once commenced the journey to the Elswick Cemetery, about a mile distant. The bitter wind and driving rain gradually thinned the concourse which at first accompanied the funeral, but about two hundred persevered as far as the cemetery. The inter ment took place during the height ofthe storm, and the proceedings at the graveside were necessarily made as brief as possible. The resting place of the deceased is marked by a fitting memorial, with the following quotation at the bottom : \u2014 \" After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.\" December 9. \u2014 During the early hours of this morning, an alarm ing, and what proved to be a very destructive, flood took place at Tyne Dock. A few weeks previous a similar disaster occurred at the same place. The flood which came away this day, was in every respect \u2014 as to cause and extent \u2014 similar to its predecessor, with the addition of 12 or 18 inches more depth of water. The snow storm and heavy rains had caused a large accumulation of suojv and water in the country districts beyond Tyne Docks, extending as far as Boldoi:, on the one hand, and Marsden on the other ; all of which are drained into the large culvert at the Tyne Dock, which is under the immediate charge of the North-Eastern Railway officials. After a sudden thaw, the surface water came away with great force and rapidity. The approach of the flood was first observed by a sergeant of the South Shields police force, who, having obtained assistance, proceeded to arouse the inhabitants of the houses facing the road from the head of the dock down to Templetowu. This was about three o'clock in the morning, and with but very few exceptions, the whole of the people were in their beds and asleep. The water at this time was fast rising, and it required great activity at the hands of all parties to get clear of it. The whole of the in habitants in the pit cottages known as Pit Row, or Slake Row, however, were able to get safely out of their houses, but they were necessitated to leave their clothing, furniture and other effects. In the course of a short time one ofthe company's officials arrived, and soon fully one hundred men were engaged in making temporary outlets for the water into the dock, by which means it was expected it would be got rid of \u2022 iu the course of the morning, but it"], [127, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 97 was found necessary to make a deep and extensive cutting from Templetown corner to the Dock ; and the work of excavating and taking the stones out of the dock was one of no small difficulty. During the morning the water instead of subsiding \u2014 though some drains leading direct into the dock were opened \u2014 seemed to gain rapidly, and about nine o'clock the waters had so increased that they overflowed first the flags in front of Slake Terrace \u2014 some 200 yards from Slake Row \u2014 and then in a very short time the whole turnpike, extending from tho Jarrow Chemical Company's acid chambers to the first archway above the dock warehouses and offices \u2014a distance of about 600 yards or more \u2014 presented the appearance of a river. The whole of the twenty-eight cottages in Pit Row were inundated to the depth of fully four feet * and a public house at the corner of the Back Row was immersed up to the window sills and the sneck of the outer doors. Among the pitmeu, a most painful excitement was caused from the fact that in one of the houses in Slake Row, at the time the flood came away, was lying the body of Wm. Graham, a pitman, employed at Hartou Colliery, who had died the previous night. On the Wednesday previous, he had both his legs broken by some tubs running upon him while at work. In the course of the morning a boat was obtained, aud his body was removed to a house in Dock Street. A few of the first houses at the eastermost end of Slake Terrace escaped from the effects of the water, owing to standing upon an elevation ; but the shops and houses some 20 yards beyond, and extending to the other end at Mr. Blanche's hotel, were flooded to the depth of from two to three feet. In Slake Terrace were several provision, butcher, outfittiug, and other shops, as well as a public house, and the amount of des- truction inflicted upon the stocks of the tradespeople, as well as the damage to the furniture, it is difficult to estimate. In a butcher's shop, the water extended fully eighteen inches up the beef he had hanging ready to be cut up. The post-office, was flooded to such an extent that business was suspended during the whole of the day. All messages from Tyne Dock had to be taken down to the South Shields post-office. Immediately opposite to the high end of Slake Terrace were some low wooden shops and new brick houses. These, too, were invaded by the resistless flood. The roadway at the foot of Boldon Lane to the dock was completely impassable, and in order to open communication between the railway station at Tyne Dock and the dock, it was necessary to erect a wooden bridge across the turnpike ; and a horse and cart belonging to the North-Eastern Railway Company, plied across the road during the whole of the day. From about eleven o'clock in the forenoon until night the appearance of the road from the end of Boldon Lane to the end of the Pit Row was that of a river in a gale of wind. December 9. \u2014 A storm of great violence, and blowing from the S.E., prevailed upon the north-east coast this day. The sea had not been so high since the awful \" Stanley\" catastrophe night in November, 1864; and the greatest anxiety prevailed as to the u"], [128, "98 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. safety of shipping running to the Tyne. The banks at North and South Shields were clad with spectators all day, notwithstanding the pouring rain. At half-past six o'clock a screw steamer was seen to be in difficulties on the bar. She was observed to drive towards the Herd, on the south side of the harbour and the South Pier. She took the ground inside the latter. This steamer was ascertained to be the Eagle, (Captain Siddal), of London. She left Shields the day previous, ooal laden, for London. At the time of her departure the weather was moderate but hazy. All went well until about seven o'clock in the evening, the vessel being off Whitby, when the gale came away with great violence. Shortly afterwards it was ascertained the steamer had sprung a leak. She was put about and ran for the Tyne, and arrived in the offing about six o'clock. At half-past six she reached the bar, and at this point she was struck by a heavy sea, which carried away the wheel. A second sea struck her, she broached to and drove on to the Herd Sand, between the South Pier and the Fish Quay, and nearly oppo site the Life Brigade House. A signal was fired from the Life Brigade House, and the guns of Her Majesty's ship Castor announced that a ship was on shore. Soon there was a full attendance of the members of the brigade, as well as a number of the general public, and the rocket apparatus was got out and in operation. In the meantime the Northumberland Lifeboat, of North Shields, and the Tyne and Providence boats, of South Shields, were manned and on their way to the locality of the wreck. While they were thus proceeding on their way, the members ofthe Volunteer Life Brigade had fired the rocket and effected a communication with the stranded ship. At this time, however, the lifeboats reached the steamer, and got secured alongside. The crew of the Eagle pre ferred to reach the shore by the lifeboats, instead of by the rocket apparatus. Twelve of them, including the captain, were taken on board the lifeboat Tyne, and landed at South Shields * the remain ing five being taken on board the Northumberland lifeboat, and landed at North Shields. The former were taken to a public bouse, at the Coble Landing, South Shields, and the latter to the Tyne Sailors' Home, North Shields, at each of which places they were supplied with dry clothing aud needful refreshments. Two of the crew, in getting from the steamer to the lifeboats, were slightly bruised. About twenty minutes past four o'clock, a most tragical event was witnessed by the crowds of spectators who were on the banks watching vessels coming to Shields harbour. A schooner was seen tolerably well to the southward of the bar, and running for the harbour. When nearly abreast of the end of the South Pier she got amongst a number of terrible seas, one of which tripped her out, and she capsized. Another huge roller followed, and crushed her completely out of sight. When the sea cleared away nothing could be seen of ther.unfortunate vessel in the dim twilight. Guns were fired from the^Castor, and the lifeboats were put out to attempt to pick up the crew, but when they reached"], [129, "A.D. 1870.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 99 the scene of the disaster the vessel and the hapless seamen were gone. Not a vestige of them could be seen. She was supposed to have been a vessel of some eight or nine keels, and would carry seven or eight hands. In about a quarter of an hour after she had disappeared, portions of the wrecked vessel began to drift on shore; and among the wreckage picked up was a stern board, with the name of \" Samuel Bernard, of Boston,'' which seems to have been the name of the ill-fated schooner. Two leaves of an official log book were also picked up, which had evidently belonged to the Samuel Bernard, and showed that from July 12 to the 8th of October at least she had been in the habit of trading between Hull and Rochester. A family Bible was also picked up, and a quantity of clothing, but nothing to lead to the names of the unfortunate men who were drowned. Later on, the body of a boy, apparently about sixteen years of age, was picked up alongside the pier. The poor fellow's head, face, and body, which was naked, the clothes having been Utterly torn off his back, were so severely cut and smashed that any attempt at identification or description was im possible. His head was split in two, his face was bruised, and his body cut in several places, and his legs were broken very badly. During the night other portions of the wreck came ashore on the beach, and several members of the brigade were on the look-out in case any more bodies should be washed ashore. Between six and seven o'clock, the barque City of Bristol, 539 tons, Captain Wm. Sinclair, drifted to the Long Sands midway between Tynemouth and Cullercoats. The vessel which was laden with chalk ballast, arrived off the Tyne on the night pre vious. Owing to the severity of the storm, it was found that she could not safely enter the harbour, and the officers determined to lie in the offing until the wind should have abated. The heavy gale however, drove her ashore, and immediately her perilous position was observed. The Tynemouth and Cullercoats Life Brigades were soon made aware of the unfortunate position of the barque, and the members of both were early on the spot. The Cullercoats men were first to arrive, and, with the rocket apparatus, sent a shot a httle too far to the east of the vessel. The Tynemouth Brigade were no more successful in their first attempt, but the Cullercoats men caught the rigging of the ill-fated vessel next time, and the opportunity was given to those on board of landing. For some little time, however, they did not think fit to avail themselves of the op portunity thus afforded them, but subsequently they were, with two exceptions, brought to shore by the aid of the apparatus, and were lodged comfortably at the Huddlestone Arms Hotel, Cullercoats. Shortly after ten o'clock an alarm w as given that a vessel was in difficulties a little distance to the east of the North Pier, and the services ofthe Tynemouth Brigade were again quickly called into requisition. When the ship was first observed she was tossing fear fully in the broken water, abemt a quarter of a mile from Tynemouth Haven, and the cries of the unfortunate seamen on board were dis-"], [130, "100 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. tinctly heard. She drifted gradually to the north, and when the Tynemouth Brigade arrived she had struck upon some dangerous rocks known as Nettly Brigs, about a mile from shore, and about half way between Tynemouth and Cullercoats. The signal guns fired by the gallant brigade had the effect of drawing some hundreds of persons to the Long Sands, and, although the rain was coming down in torrents, the scene presented was of an animated character. Immediately after the Tynemouth men had fired their shot, they were joined by the Cullercoats brigade, who took up a position on the side of the ship. By this time the sea was breaking over her with very great fury, and owing to her distance from the shore, few expected that any assistance could be rendered by the willing and ready brigadesmen. One rocket after another was fired without success, until the ninth from the Tynemouth men raised the hopes of the spectators by going right over the rigging of the vessel. It missed its effect, however, and after another had been fired, but without success, the Pomfret and Goole lifeboats, which had been drawn up from Tynemouth, was launched with very con siderable difficulty, and manned by her daring crew, put off amidst the breakers to the assistance of those on board of the vessel. At the same time the ship seemed to shift further in northwards, and as the lifeboat gradually made up to her the cheers were almost deafening. Every stroke on the part of the lifeboat crew brought the Pomfret and Goole nearer the vessel, and at midnight they got fairly alongside. The ship was discovered to be the Norwegian schooner Emalie, heavily laden with deals, and the six hands on board were rescued and brought safely to shore amidst the applause of the spectators. Subsequently the vessel, having moved on to some other rocks, became a total wreck. December 10. \u2014 Died, at Carlisle, the Rev. Charles Vernon Harcourt, rector of Rothbury. The deceased was in the 73rd year of his age, and had held bis appointment since 1824, succeeding his brother, the Rev. Leveson Vernou Harcourt, M.A. chancellor of York Cathedral. Mr Harcourt took a warm and active interest in the education of the children of Rothbury, and established a public library in the year 1850, to which he presented 295 volumes of valuable books, and a suitable bookcase. In the same year, the old church was re-modelled under his superintendence, and to a great extent at his own cost. The old pew system was cleared away, and substantial plain open seats of much neatness were substituted ; and the chancel was appi opriately fitted up with the stalls. The rev. gentleman, besides holding the rectorship of Rothbury, was a canon of Carlisle Cathedral. December 15. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Northumberland Square, North Shields, after a short and sharp illness of little more than a week, Dr. Dodd, in the 64th year of his age. He had been connected with education in North Shields since 182*7, and before he com menced an academy of his own he was some years an assistant with"], [131, "FAIL OB Iff, Northumberland . VHK SEAT OF THi; HOlF.filV.eiai Worth*"], [132, ""], [133, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 101 his father-in-law, the late Rev. W. Lietch, the father of the Town Clerk of Tynemouth. Dr. Dodd was one of the founders of the North Shields Mechanics' Institution. He was also for many years one of the secretaries of the Literary and Philosophical Society, and was from its earliest beginnings one of the executive ofthe Northern Union of Mechanics' Institutes. Dr. Dodd was amongst the last of the great school of distinguished Northumberland mathematicians, of which Mr. W. S. B. Woolhouse is at this time the remaining living member. Dr Dodd was also eminent and distinguished in other branches of the abstract sciences, and was a diligent student until the very last hours of an active life. The doctor published various treatises upon scientific and popular subjects, in which he exhibited a fine scholarly taste and a great command of language and the hidden meaning of words. He was a North Tyne man, having been born in the neighbourhood of Bellingham, and much of the beautiful poetry of his hills lingered in his memory and found expression in verse. The deceased gentleman was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was a bold and original thinker, and was an unflinching supporter of Liberalism in all its phases in the borough of Tynemouth. He was the warm friend of poor, strug- gling men all his life; and gave many hours and days and weeks from his toilsome life as a teacher to help on young men with small means but strong active powers, and in every quarter of the globe there are workers who are more or less indebted to his gratuitous services in that respect in giving them the first lift in life. Dr. Dodd was a kind-hearted, genial man, ever ready to impart infor- mation from his varied store of knowledge. He was no recluse, but was personally known to most of the leading men connected with popular education in the North. December 15. \u2014 This afternoon, the Prince and Princess Christian arrived by the ordinary train from London to Stockton, on their way to Wynyard, where they were the guests of Earl Vane for about a week. The station was tastefully decorated with evergreens and gas devices, which had been fitted up for the occasion by the Cor poration of Stockton. There were several hundreds of well dressed people in the station, all of whom had been admitted by ticket, issued by the Mayor (Mr Joseph Richardson). About half-past three o'clock, the members of the Stockton Corporation, preceded by the 1st Durham Rifle Volunteers, headed by the splendid brass band from the Stockton Malleable Iron Company's Works, marched from the Town Hall to the railway station. On the arrival of the train, the Town Clerk presented a beautifully illuminated address, signed by the Mayor, to their Royal Highnesses, the following of which is a copy : \u2014 To their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess Christian. We, the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the Borough of Stockton, in the county of Durham, whilst heartily welcoming your Royal Highnesses to our ancient borough, desire to express our deep gratification on being honoured by the presence of two of the illustrious members of the family of oar beloved sovereign. We would avail ourselves of this opportunity of"], [134, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1870. 102 expressing to your Royal Highnesses our loyalty and affection to Her Majesty the Queen, and our devoted attachment to Her Majesty's Royal Family. _ We pray that Almighty God will be pleased to grant to our sovereign a continu ance of her long and happy reign, and that her children will ever continue to be regarded with the devoted love and attachment of all classes of Her Majesty's subjects. Given under our seal this 15th December, 1870. Her Royal Highness replied as follows : Mr. Mayor and Gentle men of the Corporation, \u2014 I beg to thank you very sincerely for the hearty reception you have given us. I have heard of the loyalty of your town, and it gives me very great pleasure to witness it. Their Royal Highnesses were then conducted by Earl Vane and Lord Seaham along the platform, and were loudly cheered until they reached the carriages which were awaiting them outside the station. December 18. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Bulman Village, Newcastle on-Tyne, Thomas Doubleday, Esq., aged 81 years. The deceased was a man of considerable attainments with regard to literature and politics, a great writer on Finance, True Law of Population, &c, and one of the leading members of the Northern Political Union, which was the means of assisting the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. Mr. Doubleday never lost his interest in political movements. In the later agitation for Reform, in 1858 and 1859, he was a mem ber of the Council of the Northern Reform Union, and wrote several of the addresses published by that body. Among these was a pam phlet on \" Vote by Ballot and Shorter Parliaments,*' Mr. James Paul Cobbett contributing the section concerning the ballot, and Mr. Doubleday undertaking the portion relating to shorter Parliaments. The deceased gentleman was a warm supporter of Mr. P. A. Taylor when that gentleman was a candidate for the representation of New castle. He was also a member of the Northern Reform League, and lent his countenance and assistance to the great meeting held on the Town Moor in 1866, the gratification being afforded him of witnessing the passing of the Reform Bill of the following year, 1867. Throughout his long and active life the deceased gentleman had preserved a most upright and consistent character, and the regret of his family at his death was shared in by a large circle of literary and political friends by whom Mr. Doubleday was held in the high est esteem. December 20. \u2014 One of the most violent seas which had been seen for years was breaking with wild fury on the Durham Coast this afternoon, and yet there was scarcely a breath of wind. The sea came on about eight the previous evening, and it was so violent at Tynemouth that it carried away about one hundred feet of the way from the life-boat house of the Pomfret and Goole, at the Spanish Battery, and swept the greater portion of it into the Low Lights. Between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, several large vessels, deeply laden put to sea. In crossing the bar in tow of steam-tugs seas broke on board of two or three of them nearly half -foremast high, and snapped the tow-lines of two large vessels. One of these"], [135, "A.D. 1870.] REMARKABLE events. 103 was thrown athwart the bar, but fortunately she got into harbour again, with damage. Some of the hoppers which were at sea were in great peril ; but they were got into the harbour safely. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon the wind commenced to blow with great violence from the S.S.E. As soon as the storm came away, the life-boat crews of South Shields gathered at their station at the Lawe, and the members of the Volunteer Life Brigade in strong numbers assembled in their comfortable watch-house on the South Pier and kept a sharp look-out. The Brigade men had not long to wait before their valuable services were needed, for about seven o'clock the guns from the Spanish Battery and the Castor training-ship gave warning that a vessel was in danger at the south side of the harbour. The members in the Brigade-house observed the lights too near to the end of the South Pier, and on rushing along, it proved to be the barque Union, of Colchester, which had struck on the rubble foundation at the extreme end of the South Pier. As soon as the fact was ascertained, a strong band of the Volunteer Life Brigade hastened to the end of the pier with the rocket apparatus, and took means to rescue the crew. Fortunately, the first rocket fired was successful, and in a very short time the tackle of the apparatus was fixed to the mast of the barque and the first of the crew \u2014 the cabin boy \u2014 was sent ashore safely, amid the cheers of the spectators. The whole of the crew were soon brought to land and conveyed to the brigade-house, where they were supplied with warm clothing and refreshments. December 20. \u2014 Prince Christian and a large party of noblemen, the guests of the Earl Vane, at Wynyard, were out shooting, and had excellent sport. In the evening about thirty gentlemen sat down to dinner at the hall, and at ten o'clock a grand ball was held iu the Pink Drawing Room. Over the entrance hall door there was a brilliantly illuminated star, and crimson cloth was laid from the entrance steps into the statue gallery, where the band of the Seaham Artillery played selections of music. The ball was opened by a country dance, \" The Bonnie Pit Laddie,\" the Prince and the Countess Vane, and the Earl Vane and the Princess leading off the dance.

S. Thompson) presented to Mr. Cleghorn a testimonial of the esteem and respect in which the shareholders and the board regarded him, in the pro spect of his being about to sever that official connection which had existed between him and the company as its secretary for a period of above fourteen years. The testimonial consisted of a purse of \u00a31,000, and a beautifully-ornamented silver inkstand, of the valueof fifty guineas. 1871 {January '_>). \u2014 The will 'of John Greene, Esq., of Rodsley House, Gateshead, was proved in the Court of Probate at Londo**-. The personal effects were under \u00a390,000. The following public institutions had legacies bequeathed to them, viz. : \u2014 Gateshead Dispensary, \u00a3500 ; Abbot Industrial Schools, Gateshead, \u00a3200 ; Newcastle Infirmary, \u00a3200; Northern Counties' Institution for Deaf and Dumb, \u00a3200; Royal Victoria Asylum for the Blind, \u00a3200; Hospital for Sick Children in Newcastle, \u00a3200 ; Church Missionary Society, London, \u00a3200 ; Prudhoe Convalescent Home, Whitley, \u00a3200; and the National Lifeboat Institution. \u00a3200. January 5. \u2014 This morning a fire was discovered on board the brig Cospetta Zulo, Captain Antonio Marisco, of Naples, lying at No. 7 Tier, North Shields, whereby the lives of three of the seamen were sacrificed. The vessel had received a cargo of coals, and was ready to proceed to sea, the captain, with two of the crew being on shore, while six seamen were left in charge of the vessel. The captain of the tug Gipsy Queen was the first to observe the fire, and he at once raised an alarm. The river floating fire engine was soon on the spot, and extinguished the fire, but not before consider- able damage had been done. The vessel being boarded none of the crew were to be seen, and a search was at once instituted for them. Upon the berths being examined the six men were found lyiug in apparently a lifeless condition. They were brought on deck, and a messenger was despatched for medical assistance, when three were found to be dead. The bodies of those of the seamen who were dead were removed to the dead-house at the Low Lights. The men who were still alive, but suffering evidently from the effects of suffoca- tion, were removed on shore and conveyed to the Union Hotel, Liddell Street. It appears that the fire on board had originated in the cabin, where, it is supposed, a stove had been lighted. The smoke which had accumulated in the cabin had passed from thence between the deck and the cargo to the forecastle, where the mate and five of the crew were sleeping. The presence of this smoke, it is believed, had been the cause of the death of three of the men \u2014 the mate and two seamen \u2014 and of the dangerous position in which the others were placed. The vessel was badly burnt aft, and had to be discharged and undergo considerable repairs. None of the seamen were burnt ; the three men who were dead having been suffo cated by the smoke. N"], [138, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. 106 January 9. \u2014 This afternoon, the remains of William Sidney Gibson, Esq., for many years registrar of the Bankruptcy Court, Arcade, Newcastle-on-Tyne, were interred in a vault in the Tyne mouth Priory Churchyard. The body arrived at the Tynemouth railway station about two o'clock in the afternoon from London, where Mr. Gibson died, and was met by a number of the friends of the deceased, who were assembled at the Royal Hotel. The weather was exceedingly stormy. The body was conveyed into the Lady's Chapel, where the service was conducted by the Rev. T. H Brutton. The members of Christ Church Mission Choir were present, and intoned a portion of the service. They also sung the following two hymns, while the company were assembled in the Lady's Chapel \u2014 \" When our heads are bowed with woe\" and \" Thy will be done.\" At the conclusion of the service in the chapel, the body was con veyed to and deposited in a vault situated at the west side of the Lady's Chapel. The remains ofthe deceased were enclosed first in a shell, then in a lead coffin, and next in a magnificent oak coffin, elaborately ornamented. January 11. \u2014 Souter Point Lighthouse, a little south of the River Tyne, and not far from the port of Sunderland, was this evening lighted up for the first time. An excellent site has been selected on Souter Point, about midway between the rivers Tyne and Wear, where the light will be comparatively free from the dense masses of smoke that are ever sent from these busy centres of manufacturing industry. The tower is placed a', a distance of 345 yards from the edge of the cliff; it is 75f feet high from base to vane, and shows, at an elevation of 150 feet above high water, a revolving electric white light of great brilliancy at intervals of 30 seconds ; the duration of flash to interval of darkness is in the ratio of 1 to 5, thus giving 5 seconds for the duration of each flash, and 25 seconds for each interval of darkness. Each flash differs somewhat from that of an ordinary apparatus for oil light, inasmuch as it appears \"and disappears suddenly, and is of nearly equal intensity throughout. This apparatus was expressly manufactured for the purpose, and consists of a portion of the dioptric apparatus ofthe third order for fixed light ; around this is rotated a hexag onal drum of glass, consisting of eight panels of vertical lenses ; by these lenses the divergent and continuous sheet of light from the fixed portion of the apparatus is gathered up so as to form distinct beams, which successively reach the observer as the panels pass in succession before him. It is a remarkable piece of optical skill, requiring the utmost care both in mathematical calculation and manufacture. A lower light, also electric, is shown from the same tower at a distance of 22 feet below the upper light, for marking dangers in Sunderland Bay. Directly this light is opened from seaward it shows white, and seamen will know that while it con tinues so, they are on the line of Mill Rock ; standing further into the shore it changes to red, indicating that they are then in the line of the Hendon Rock and the White Stones. As Mill Rock is"], [139, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 107 a very short distance from the lighthouse, it will be safe to navi gate in the White Beam unless close to ; but when the Red Beam is opened, except seamen be going into Sunderland, they should not go further in shore. If bound to Sunderland, the red beam, with the assistance of the Sunderland Pier light, will enable them to avoid the Hendon Rock and White Stones. This lower light is a novelty in lighthouse illumination, on a principle adopted by the Trinity House engineer, and is from the same electric spark as the upper light. To obtain this result, the light of the landward side of the spai k, which is usually but imperfectly utilized, is collected and condensed into a small cylindrical beam of great intensity, and is sent, by reflection, down the centre ofthe tower to the required distance below the upper light, where it is again reflected, and sent, through a lower window, over the required sector of sea surface. At this lowrer window a simple but important contrivance has been introduced for cleaning the glass externally in all states of the weather, without the necessity of opening the window, or for the lightkeeper in charge to go outside the tower. The electricity for the production of the spark is generated by one of Professor Hol mes's magneto-electric machines, worked by a steam-engine of 6-J indicated horse power. The magneto-electric machine contains 56 compound permanent steel magnets, and is driven at speed of 400 revolutions per minute. The steam-engine, boiler, and magneto electric machine are all duplicated, in case of accident or want of repair to any part ; and, during such states of the atmosphere as lights are imperfectly visible, both magno-electric machines will be worked, thus doubling the power of the current of electricity, and consequently the intensity of the light. But as a further precau tion against accident, an oil lamp is placed in position, aud is always in readiness to take the place of the electric light at any moment. The machinery was exhibited at the International Exhibition held at Paris in 18o7, with which an electric light was shown every night during five months ofthe period during which the _ exhibition was open, the light receiving high commendation from the international jury. During foggy weather a powerful fog horn, also the inven tion of Mr. Holmes, will be sounded. The horn is placed 97 feet seaward of the lighthouse, at an elevation of 85 feet above high water, and is blown by air compressed by the steam-engine, and sent through a pipe underground to an iron receiver, on which is an automatic apparatus wbich causes the horn to traverse to and fro, and send its sound to every part of the adjacent sea, and regu lates the number and duration of the blasts. It is arranged that the number of blasts be two per minute, the duration of each blast being five seconds, with an interval of twenty-five seconds corres ponding with the flashes and intervals of the light. The buildings comprise dwellings for five light-keepers (one principal, who is a duly qualified mechanical engineer, and four assistants), engine house, boiler house, coke store, workshop, and store-room ; these are specially arranged for securing the utmost efficiency in the ser-"], [140, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. 108 vice of the establishment. As no spring water could be found at or near the site, arrangements were made for collecting and stor ing a large supply of rain water for the service of the steam engines and establishment generally. The Deputy-Master of the London Trinity House opened the proceedings by referring to the origin of the light, which he characterised as a most powerful oue. He stated that on its construction and illumination the highest lighthouse engineering talent of the day had been brought to bear ; and he made bold to say that no lighthouse in any part of the world would bear comparison with it. He alluded to the dangerous character of the coast, and expressed a hope that the light would be instru mental in saving life and property. Sir Hedworth Williamson endorsed the remarks of the Deputy-Master, adding that he himself had urged on the Trinity House tbe necessity of erecting a light house to guard the shoals that lay in the vicinity of Whitburn. The Rev. Mr. Hitchcock then offered up a suitable prayer, after which Lady Williamson gracefully performed the inauguration ceremony by starting the engines, when a brilliant light was produced. The fog-horn, which was subsequently tested, was found to work satis factorily, and the interesting proceedings terminated. January 12. \u2014 The annual ceremony of installing the Worshipful Master to the Tyne Lodge (991 of the Grand Lodge of Eugland) was performed this day. There was a very numerous attendance of brethren and visitors. The lodge was opened in due form by the W.M. Bro. Hanson, and the usual business having been tran sacted, Bro. E. D. Davis, P.P.S.W. and P.G.D.C, assumed the chair as Installing Master. Bro. Hanson presented Bro. Addison Potter, W.M. -Elect, to the Installing Master, who, in a very impressive and solemn manner; performed the ceremony cf installation. The Worshipful Master-Elect, on ascending the throne of K.S., elected the following as his officers : \u2014 Bro. Hanson, I.P.M. ; Bro. Burroughs, S.W.; Bro. Jarvis, J.W. ; Bro. G. A. Allan, treasurer; Bro. R. Fenwick, secretary ; Bro. M. Guthrie, S.D. ; Bro. Bruce, J.D ; Bro. Christie, J.G. ; Bro. A. Davis, S.S. ; Bro Currie, J.S. ; Bro. G. Heslop, tyler. The installing master having addressed the officers and members in a very impressive manner, the W.M. closed the lodge in due form, and the members and visitors adjourned to the annual banquet, which was served up in superb form in the Drill Shed, Willington Quay. About sixty members sat down, and the chair was occupied by Bro. Addison Potter, W.M., and the vice-chairs by Bro. Burroughs, S.W., and Bro. Jarvis, J.W. January 15. Died, at the residence of his son (Major Fife), Reedsmouth House, North Tyne, after a few hours' illness, Sir John Fife, Knight, in his 76th year. The family of which Sir John Fife had been so many years the head and representative, although long since naturalised to Newcastle, was of exotic origin. The grandfather of Sir John was a Scotchman, who some time in the eighteenth century took up his residence in the Castle Garth, then"], [141, "A.D. 1871.] BEMARKABLE EVEXfS. 109 inhabited by many of the principal citizens. Mr. Fife being a prudent, frugal, and industrious man, was successful in his business, and able to give his son a professional education. The latter was in due time qualified to practise medicine ; and in this higher walk of life he was as fortunate as his father had been in trade. The house on the south-west corner of Collingwood Street, so long occupied by Mr. Gregson, and at the present time by Mr. Pape's gun manufactory, was for many years the residence of William Fife, Esq., surgeon. The deceased gentleman was born there in 1795 ; and among his recollections, while a boy, to which he used to refer in social conversation with the more intimate of his friends was one which clung to his memory with special tenacity, viz. : his having been taken by his grandfather to see the races, and of having witnessed them, on more than one occasion, from the arms of the old man, who enjoyed the sport in a quiet way. Sir John was always a warm lover of horse flesh ; and as a young man, at a period when his professional duties were not so onerous as they were during the latter part of his life, he used to figure occasionally on the racecourse as a gentleman rider. A contemporary sketch states that in those days Sir John was not only a bold rider, but in some degree a popular favourite ; but the spring time of his greater popularity had not then commenced. He was known as a high spirited young gentleman who was feeling his way into a profes sional practice ; but, by-and-bye, he was to become a great popular political leader, in the cause of the people. Previous to 1830, the part taken by Mr. Fife in political agitation does not seem to have been specially conspicuous. That he attended meelings, presided over them sometimes, and occasionally spoke, with the decision and neatness so characteristic of his style, there can be no doubt ; but it was not until 1830, when an effort was made to unite the Whigs and the Democrats, that we find him occupying a position of decided influence, and acting as one of the high contracting parties in the proposed political compact. This meeting was held at the old Turk's Head, under the presidency of the late Dr. Headlam. Its ostensible object was to petition the Mayor to call a meeting of the inhabitants to \" attest the sympathy of Englishmen with the cause of liberty in France.\" The speeches were reported at length, not only in the local papers, but in the leading political journals of the Metropolis\u2014 a circumstance which shows that the meeting was looked upon by more than the politicians of the north as one of great importance. In order to maintain and extend their influence in the government of the country, the Whig party had recourse to the formation of Political Unions. There was the National Union, which had London as the centre of its operations ; the Birmingham Union, which, as its name implies, had its head quarters in that busy town, but reached with its influence over the Midland Counties ; and the Northern Political Union, with Mr. Chas. Attwood for its president, was established in Newcastle. This latter society was formed upon the model of that of Birming-"], [142, "110 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. ham ; and embraced within its operations the counties of Northum berland, Durham, and Cumberland. Mr. Fife was one of the gentlemen chiefly entrusted with the arrangement of the pre liminaries for the formation of the union \u2014 his coadjutors having been Mr. Eneas Mackenzie and Mr. Charles Attwood. A meeting of the friends of Reform was held in the Music Hall, on the 27th June, 1831, for the purpose of considering the propriety of forming a Northern Political Union. Mr. C. Attwood was chair man, and Mr. Thomas Doubleday was secretary. The speakers on the occasion were Mr. Fife, Mr. Robert Blakey, Mr. William Henry Brockett, Mr. Charles Abbs, Mr. Charles Larkin, Mr. H. R. Roddam, Mr. Addison Langhorne Potter, and Mr. Joseph Watson. The shop of Mr. Charnley, bookseller, was a favourite resort of the Whigs, and at one of the gatherings there, a requisition was got up to the Mayor to call a public meeting to petition the House of Lords in favour of the Reform Bill. The meeting was held, but the Whig petition was objected to by Mr. Attwood, on the part of the Radi cals, as unworthy of the occasion. Mr. Attwood proposed a counter petition, which, although objected to by the Mayor, was ultimately adopted by a large majority, on which the Whig party left the Guildhall en masse. After the retirement of the Mayor and his friends, Mr. Fife was called to the chair, and the business pro ceeded, resulting in complete victory to the Radical party. At the meeting held on the Town Moor, 17th October, 1S31, subse quent to the rejection of the Reform Bill by the House of Lords, Mr. Fife played a conspicuous part. On the 31st of the same month, a great meeting was held at Durham to deliberate ou the rejection of the bill, and to adopt an address to His Majesty and His Majesty's Ministers. A large body of the members of the Northern Political Union, under the leadership of Mr. Fife and Mr. Attwood, at an early hour of the morning, surrounded the hustings from which the speakers were to address the people, and by the promptitude of their action, effectually prevented the dis turbances which were intended by the junction of the Londonderry men with the Durham freemen. It was in accordance with a pro posal of Mr. Fife that the Northern Political Union, following the example of the Birmingham Society, formally announced its inten tion to resist the payment of taxes until the Reform Bill had passed. At the great Spital meeting, held May 15, 1832, in connection with the resignation of Earl Grey, Mr. Fife commenced the proceedings by nominating Dr. Headlam to the chair \u2014 a motion which was unanimously carried. One of the best speeches of the day was spoken by Mr. Fife ; and in several respects it was one of the best he ever delivered. It was pitched at the outset upon a high key, and the starting note was fu'ly sustained throughout. He charged the majority of the House of Lords with having a scandalous and dishonest project in promoting the perpetuation of abuses, and taunted them with their inability to get up such a meeting as that which he was then addressing, quoting the memorable words of"], [143, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 111 Fox with respect to the Sedition Bills of 1793, viz., that \"The Houses of Lords and Commons may pass these bills, they may even receive the Royal sanction, and yet be so unconstitutional, so grevious to the sense of the nation, that obedience is no longer a moral duty, and insurrection itself justifiable.\" Mr. Fife declared that the principles exhibited in these words were his. \" On a future occasion,\" he continued, \" when he (Fox) was called upon by Mr. Pitt to explain, he only repeated the words, and said, ' In these principles I will live and die.' \" \" Here,\" said Mr. Fife, \" is an immense multitude, and is there one man who will not join me in holding up his right hand and repeating after me \u2014 ' In these principles I will live and die V \" The effect of this appeal was electric ; the response was prompt and universal. Over the im mense multitude nothing was seen but uplifted hands, and the orator was interrupted by the auditors, Mr. Fife repeating, with still greater emphasis, \" In these principles I will live and die.\" The words were scarcely pronounced, when a forest of oak saplings were elevated above the heads of the people, as if to intimate that all there were not only prepared to register a vow, but to act in accordance with it. This significant display seems to have sug gested the concluding remarks of the speaker. \" I know,\" he said, \" that many of my fellow-countrymen are armed ; that many are arming ; and every man in this country has as good a right to his arms as the Marquis of Londonderry ; and I hold that the most ignorant and simple-minded man in this assembly is as likely to make a proper use of them. I, however, call upon you to remem ber that the recourse to violence is the last and worst resort. The House of Commons yet stands between this country and a revolu tion. If it only prove that it is the representative of the nation, the people may obtain their rights without compulsion aud blood shed. Let us, therefore, with one voice, exclaim \u2014 ' Privilege of Parliament ! Privilege of Parliament !' but remember, until that cry is disregarded, until privilege of Parliament ceases to exist, or is grossly violated, then, and not till then, shall I for one exclaim \u2014 ' To your tents, 0 Israel !'\" Soon after the passing of the Reform Bill, he ceased to be a member of the Northern Union, Parliamentary Reform was followed by Municipal, and Mr. Fife was elected a councillor of St. Nicholas at the head of the poll. He was not long, however, a councillor ; the Council chose him an alderman at its first meetiug. He was, also, in 1838, appointed to the office of Mayor. It was the time of the Chartist agitation ; and the part which he played in the suppression of a public meeting, and in the preservation of order, gained him the honour of knighthood, which was conferred on him ou the 1st of July, 1840, \" as a mark of approbation of the manner in which he had sustained the office of chief magistrate under very critical circum stances.\" In 1843, he was elected a second time to the office of Mayor, but on this occasion his official reign was marked by no specialty. In the debates of the Council Sir John Fife sustained a"], [144, "112 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. prominent and able part, but in 1862 a circumstance transpired which led to his severance from the body corporate. That year was characterised by a series of discussions on the management of the Cattle Market, in the course of which not a little temper was displayed, and the motion submitted by Sir John, with the view of reconciling the contending parties, was rejected by a considerable majority. On the 18th November, the alderman, in a note to the then Mayor, intimated his wish to retire from the Council, no reason at the time being assigned for the step. On the official communication of the result to the members of the Corporation, an animated conversation took place, and it was even- tually resolved that the resignation be not accepted, but that a letter be written to Sir John, assuring him of the high esteem en- tertained by his colleagues for his personal character, and requesting him to reconsider his decision, and take his seat in the Council of which he had been so bright an ornament for so many years. But the alderman was inexorable. In another letter, dated the 3rd of January, 1863, he stated that for some time past he had at times entertained the intention of quitting the Council Chamber, and the treatment of his late conciliatory motion on the Cattle Market complication convinced him that the period had arrived when he might with propriety, and at once, carry out his intention. He, therefore, desired it to be understood that his resignation should be regarded as irrevocable. The resignation was then accepted ; and thus, after extending over a period of nearly thirty years, was brought to a close the municipal career of Sir John Fife. The deceased knight was a magistrate aud deputy-lieutenant for the town and county of Newcastle. Of educational and other measures promoted for the improvement of the masses, Sir John Fife was a warm supporter. For many years he was president of the Mechanics' Institution, and he was one of the principal speakers at the laying of the foundation-stone of the new building in New Bridge Street, on the 19th of April, 1865. The volunteer movement, from its commencement, found an ardent supporter in Sir John. He took an active interest in the orioi- nation of the first Newcastle-on-Tyne Rifle Volunteer Corps, which was enrolled on the 23rd of December, 1859. It was mainly owin<*- to the zeal and judgment he displayed in guiding the movement here during its first stages that it was so successful in Newcastle. Sir John was proud of his position as lieutenant-colonel of the corps, and the corps was proud of Sir John. He discharged the duties of his office with the liveliest zeal, and made important sacrifices, both of time and money, for the advancement of the interests of the corps. At the numerous velunteer displays which have from time to time taken place in the North, Sir John was invariably present, his last appearance in this capacity being at the review on the Town Moor on the 18th of July, 1868, when 4,452 volunteers took part in the imposing spectacle ; and under all circumstances when on duty the gallant knight seemed native and born to the"], [145, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 113 c manner of military command. With declining health anl strength, however, he was compelled to relinquish the position he had so long held in the corps ; and about the beginning of December, 1868, his retirement from the office of lieutenant-colonel was formally announced. The regret excited by this event was, it need scarcely be said, increased by its cause ; and at a meeting of the members of the corps on the 25th of January, 1869, the following resolution was adopted : \u2014 \" That we, the officers, non-commissioned officers, and members of the First Newcastle Rifle Volunteer Corps, regret the retirement of Sir John Fife from the command of the regiment under circumstances so peculiarly sad, and desire to tender to him our most sincere and heartfelt sympathy, with the hope that every needful blessing may be bestowed upon our late gallant commander.\" About a month afterwards, a still more practical shape was given to the feelings of the regiment when a magnificent silver centre- piece, valued \u00a3100, and subscribed for by the officers and members ofthe First Newcastle Rifle Volunteers, was privately presented to him at his residence in Northumberland Street, Newcastle, by a depu- tation appointed for the purpose. The sentiments of the subscri- bers were further embodied in a beautifully-illuminated address, which had appended to it the signatures of 200 donors to the testi monial. As to the professional merits of the deceased gentleman, his fame as a skilful surgeon and eminent physician had extended far beyond the limits of Newcastle ; and the extent of his practice in the district showed how widely his abilities were appreciated. For thirty years he was one of the honorary physicians of the New- castle Infirmary ; and on his retirement from that position on the 22nd of November, 1867, a cordial vote of thanks was passed to him for the faithful and able manner in which he had discharged the duties of the office during that long period. The mortal re- mains of Sir John Fife were interred in the pretty little burial ground attached to St. Cuthbert's Church, Bellingham, in a quiet and unostentatious manner. It was at first supposed that the body would be publicly buried in Newcastle, but owing to Sir John's well-known aversion to all the trappings and ceremonies of a funeral, and to the fact that the family vault had already been closed, it was decided, to the great regret of the many hundreds of persons who were desirous of showing their respect to his memory, to bury him privately in the new vault which had been constructed at Bel lingham. The body was lifted from Reedsmouth House a little before two o'clock in the afternoon, in the presence of not more than a score of people, and placed, amid the sobs of a sorrowing household, in a plain unpretending little hearse from Hexham. In the only two accompanyiDg mourning coaches were Major John Fife, Mr. Henry Fife, and Mr. Jos. Bainbridge Fife, sons of the deceased ; Mr. \"Edward Crawshay, of Haughton Castle, son-in law ; and Mr. John George Brown and Mr. Newmarch, of New- castle, relatives ; while Mr. Robert Riddell, Mr. Peter Rogers, Mr. Thomas Forster, Mr. Thomas Pickering, of Reedsmouth, and Mr, o"], [146, "114 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871 John Richardson, Mr. Wm. Hutchinson, Mr. James Aynsley, and Mr. Geo. Veitch, of Bellingham, walked on either side of the hearse as under-bearers and pall-bearers for both ends of the journey. The route between Reedsmouth and Bellingham wasover a road rendered hard and glistening by the intensity of the frost, aud which in many places overlooked the peaceful valley of the Tyne ; but, with the exception of a solitary herdsman, or the occupants of some solitary dwelling on the wayside, there was scarcely an onlooker discernible in any direction. The coffin was met at the church by the Rev. R. P. Powell, the vicar, and was conveyed into the aisle of the old fashioned edifice to the grandly impressive music of the \" Dead March in Saul.\" The beautiful services of the church having been very feelingly read both in the pulpit aud at the grave, the coffin was at once lowered to its resting-place, aud the mourners slowly took their departure from the spot. The only inscription on the breast-plate was \u2014 \" Sir John Fife, died Jan. 15th, 1871, aged 75 years.\" January 21. \u2014 Died, at Lambton Castle, the seat of her husband, the Countess of Durham. The sad event, which created a deep gloom throughout the district, was quite unexpected by all not resident within the precincts of the castle, her ladyship's condition being reported as favourable, with a likelihood of a speedy recovery from her accouchment. It appears that the countess was delivered of a son about ten o'clock on the 18th, Dr. Shiel, of Chester-le- Street, being in attendance. About two o'clock on the same day, her ladyship took seriously ill ; and it being deemed necessary to call in further medical assistance, Drs. Charlton and Gibson, of Newcastle, were telegraphed for. These gentlemen arrived about six o'clock, but the condition of the countess was so far satisfactory, that their further attendance was not deemed necessary. Although her progress was but slow, no fears were entertained for the safety of her ladyship, and at six o'clock on the evening preceding her death, when her medical attendant left the castle, not the slightest apprehension was felt on her behalf. About ten o'clock that night, however, unfavourable symptoms made their appearance, and Dr. Shiel was at once summoned to her aid. Everything that skill could devise in her behalf was put into requisition, but her ladyship gradually sank, and expired about three o'clock this morning. Lady Beatrix Frances Lambton was the second daughter of the Duke of Abercorn, by his wife, Lady Louisa Jane Russell, second daughter of the 6th Duke of Bedford, K.G., who was half-sister to Earl Russell. Lady Durham was born in 1835, and was married to George Frederick D'Arcy Lambton, 2nd Earl of Durham, in 1854, and was consequently 35 years of age at the time of her demise. She left thirteen children, nine sons and four daughters, by her marriage, viz., John George (Viscount Lambton) and Fred erick William, twin sons, born 1855 ; Hedworth, born 1856 ; Charles, born 1857; Beatrix Louisa, born 1859; George, born 1860 ; Katherine Frances, born 1862 ; William, born 1863 ;"], [147, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 115 Claude, born 1864; D'Arcy, born 1866; Eleanor, born 1868; Ann, born 1869; and an infant son, born on the 18th of this month. The lady whose decease is now recorded had in the course of her too short life established a strong claim to the sorrowing re membrance of the poor, and for the rich there can be no more enviable obsequies than the blessings and regrets of the poor. It is not in the character of an ordinary benefactress that her death will be talked of in hushed whispers in many a cottage throughout the county which gave her title of rank. True she sanctified the afflu ence that had fallen to her lot by liberal gifts to the needy and generous aid to the struggling around her, and on this account de serves to be piously mourned and gratefully remembered. But the chief secret of her popularity lay in the simplicity, conscientiousness, and devotion with which sbe discharged the manifold duties of an English matron. Not unfrequently ladies of high rank appear to imagine that they possess in their exaltation a charter of exemption from the homely obligations of wifehood and maternity. With the Countess of Durham there was no thought of the kind. If she differed from the average of English women in her fulfilment of womanly duties, it was that she excelled them. Her temptations to neglect them were stronger than women ordinarily experience, and this probably made her the more scrupulously faithfuly, well knowing, as she did, the influence of her example, and accurately estimating the value of that influence. Had she presided over some lowlier home, her household could not have been more wisely ordered, and her children could not have had more solid reasons for rising up to bless her as they gathered round her kness, or to mourn her when they stood around her grave. Her distinguishing merit had been that she never allowed the splendour of her position to weaken her sense of duty. The beautiful spirit of motherhood was the sustaining power and prominent characteristic of her life, and it was as the tender mother of many children, the hospitable matron of a princely establishment, and the thoughful counsellor of all who came within her influence, rather than as the daughter of a duke and the wife of an earl, that she was so heartily mourned in all circles of the community. Notwithstanding her devotion to her family, she was rarely absent from the sphere in which her destiny required her to move, nor was her presence at any time other than the chief brightness of that sphere. It is this fine balancing of the duties of life that builds up the most solid and durable repu tation for practical goodness. The_ deceased countess presented no exaggeration or distortion in any feature of her character or in any aspect of her life. She was a true women, a model mother, and a brilliant lady. Had she been only any one of the three, her death must have occasioned deep grief in some circles of society ; but as she was all, and more than all that we have pictured her, the event of her removal from a world she had cheered, blessed, and improved by her life, awakened an almost universal lamentation in the dis trict to which she belonged."], [148, "116 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. January 27. \u2014 An accident of an alarming nature occurred this day at the residence of Mr. T. C. Temperley, Claremont Place, Gateshead. Mr. Temperley had erected in the rear of his house an out-shot building, the upper storey of which included a bath room. To supply the bath, a boiler was fitted up behind the kitchen fireplace, communicating with the new bath-room by means of pipes. The kitchen was on the basement storey of the house, and was sunk about eight feet below the level of the street. The drawing room was immediately above the kitchen, and the eastern gable, close against which the boiler was laid, was exposed, the ground immediately adjoining not having been built upon. The boiler was put in its place in the latter part of 1870, and in order as far as possible to ensure safety, Mr. Temperley gave the order to the well-known firm of Messrs. John Abbot and Co., Gates head. So far as was known, the boiler had been in good working order from the time it was brought into use. The fires were lit as usual in the morning, and nothing was supposed to be wrong until about one o'clock, when, without a moment's warning, the boiler exploded with a terrific shock. The plating was lifted bodily from its seat, and torn into fragments. A large portion of it was hurled across the kitchen with tremendous force, wrecking everything in its way, and dashing against the end of the house above with such impetus as to splinter the bricks into pieces. The gable against which the boiler was laid was smashed as if it had been so much window glass, and everything in the drawing room above was thrown about or broken by the shock. Worst of all, the kitchen fire was shot bodily out of the grate into the riven joists and other woodwork of the kitchen ceiling, and in a few minutes flames were burning steadily amongst the beams, and the house was filled with smoke. How it was that the explosion was unattended with loss of life is one of those things which cannot be accounted for. Two servant girls were in the basement storey at the time of the occur rence \u2014 one of them within a very short distance of the boiler \u2014 \u25a0 yet neither received any serious injury. Mr. Temperley's family, who fortunately were in the upstairs room, also escaped ; but a boy, engaged with some workmen who were busy at a new building be hind the house, jumped out of a window when the explosion took place, and was slightly bruised. The house was so shattered by the explosion as to be little better than a wreck, and Mr. Temper ley and his family had to seek shelter elsewhere. The accident occurred at a moment peculiarly calculated to damp the joy of the residents in the house. Just three hours previously Mr. Tem perley received word that his eldest surviving son, Mr. Ernest Temperley, had graduated with high honours at the Cambridge examination \u2014 being bracketted with another gentleman fourth on the list \u2014 and he was absent receiving the congratulations of his friends when the explosion took place. January 28. \u2014 This afternoon, a lamentable accident, whereby three yourig men lost their lives, occurred on the ice of the rivet"], [149, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 117 Tyne, at Hexham. During the morning a few young men and boys were engaged in skating and sliding on the frozen surface of the river, immedialely above the Tyne bridge. Most of these retired to dinner at midday, but a few remained. About half past twelve o'clock, as the three deceased were playing together, at a game called '' clubs,\" about a couple of hundred yards above the bridge, the ice, which was only three-quarters of an inch thick, suddenly broke, and in an instant the whole party were submerged in the water. The occurrence was witnessed by only two or three persons, none of whom were able to render the slightest assistance. The unfortunate fellows were not seen to rise again, and were supposed to have gone down and been drowned all clinging to each other. Search for the bodies was immediately commenced, and about two o'clock they were found by some men in a boat. The utmost excitement prevailed in Hexham after the news of the accident was received, and during the search for the bodies the sides of the river and bridge were thickly lined with spectator's. January 28. \u2014 Died, at the age of 48 years, Henry John Baker Baker, Esq. Mr. Baker was the son of Colonel Towers, who married the only daughter of George Baker, Esq., of Elemore Hall. On succeeding to the Elemore estates Mr. Towers (who then assumed the surname of Baker) at once showed himself capable of playing a prominent part in public affairs, identifying himself strongly with the Liberal side in politics, a party to which he adhered with the most steadfast constancy to the last. As chair man of the Petty Sessions at Houghton-le-Spring Mr. Baker always displayed a love of even-handed justice, together with a clearness of judgment that marked him as a most able member of the magis terial body. He was also a visiting justice of the county of Durham. As a landlord, deceased always showed the greatest kindness and indulgence, aud in his death his tenantry sustained a great loss. He was an ardent admirer of all field sports, and had fre quently filled the post of steward at the Durham Races. Mr. Baker was married in 1850 to Miss Allgood, of Nun wick, who sur vived him, and by whom he left five sons and three daughters. Besides the estate of Elemore (which he had very considerably improved and beautified) Mr. Baker was the owner of the Stanton estate, in the parish of Longhorsley, and also of the valuable farm of Bavington Myers, in Northumberland. He was also the owne r of Elemore Colliery, a mine which was sunk during his grandfather's time, and which was leased by the latter to a company. January 29. \u2014 At an early hour this morning, the extensive premises of Mr. John Gowland's drapery and millinery establishment, Church Street, Crook, were discovered to be on fire, by Miss Gow land, who was awoke about five o'clock by a crackling noise, and, on opening her bedroom window, saw smoke issuing from a small window at the back part of the shop, which adjoined the dwelling house. An alarm was at once raised and the surrounding"], [150, "118 Historical register OF [a,d. 1871. neighbourhood was a scene of great confusion. Hundreds of willing hands were engaged rendering assistance by ascending the roof and pouring on buckets of water. In the meantime, messen gers had been sent off for aid from Bishop Auckland and Brancepeth, and the fire-engines from those places were without delay sent to the scene of the conflagration. But, unfortunately, before the fire was discovered the flames were raging with such intensity that all attempts at saving the stock or premises appeared futile. By this time the fire had assumed such alarming proportions that every article of stock was almost completely destroyed. The shop was completely gutted, and the flames, in spite of all efforts, had reached the house, and it was greatly feared that the fire would spread the whole length of Church Street. The adjoining tenants began to remove their furniture, and operations were commenced for making a breach by demolishing some small cottages, aud it was not until the roof of Mr. Gowland's shop fell in that this was stopped. Most of the stock was conveyed into the churchyard opposite, and spread on the grass, but it was rendered utterly useless, and by far the greatest part was burnt to ashes and trampled underfoot. In the middle of the excitement Mr. John Gowlaud, jun., fell upon the roof, and was seriously injured, whilst two other gentlemen \u2014 Mr. Graham and Mr. Wilson, of Arthur Street \u2014 in their efforts, also fell, and received serious injuries. The damage was estimated at \u00a35,000. February 7. \u2014 Mr. Ernest Temperley, eldest surviving son of Mr. T. C. Temperley, of Gateshead, made another addition to his laurels. His name was recently published as fourth Wrangler in the Mathe matical Tripos at Cambridge, and he now appeared as second Smith's Prizeman, thus excelling all except the \"Senior Wrangler. In 1867, Mr. Temperley gained an open scholarship of \u00a340, which was afterwards increased to \u00a380. He was every year at the head of his college, and prizeman in each examination. February 8.\u2014 Considerable excitement was occasioned in Durham by the falling of a portion of the Castle. The point at which the accident occurred is situated about thirty yards up the bank from Framwellgate Bridge, and had the appearance of a buttress, curved outwards at the bottom for a few feet, and then risina* straight up wards to a height of forty feet. Investigation had proved it to have been no part of the original buildings of the Castle, but merely a narrow tower probably erected for some purpose at present unknown about 150 years ago. About four o'clock this morning some people crossing Framwellgate Bridge heard the sound of masonry rolling down the bank, and this sound was repeated about an hour afte\u00a3 wards. The grand fall did not take place uutil ten minutes to six o'clock, however, when the whole structure of the tower slid down the side of the bank, severing itself from the general buildings of the Castle as cleanly as if it had not been near that ancient struc ture, the place it lately occupied being alone represented by a light"], [151, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 119 coloured mark of a column on the Castle wall. An examination of the fallen rubbish showed the masonry of which the tower had been composed to have been of a very decayed nature, and a general feeling of thankfulness appeared to prevail that no human life had been sacrificed. During the day numbers of people assembled to view the site of the accident, and many fears were expressed for the safety of the walls of the Castle, rising as they do from the edge of the lofty eminence, and having au appearance of leaning over the face of the cliff. February 8. \u2014 A grand full dress ball was held in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, in aid of the funds of the Newcastle Infirmary, and the gathering was, as it deserved to be, a great success. The Newcastle Infirmary is one of the most valuable institutions in the North of England \u2014 valuable because of the aid which through its instrumentality is freely given to the sick and suffering poor, not only of the neighbourhood, but of all parts : for foreigners also reap the benefits of its assistance. The number of cases admitted with- in its walls during the course of one year, is something marvellous, and of course so many patients suffering from all kinds of disease and from the effects of all sorts of accidents, cannot be properly attended to but by an efficient medical staff, and by a liberal supply of those articles necessary in such an extensive hospital. These essential requisites cannot be maintained in a large establishment like the Newcastle Infirmary without considerable outlay, and as it depends solely for its continued efficiency upon the benevolence of all who have sufficient and to spare \u2014 even the smallest sums are most gratefully received \u2014 it behoves all classes to see that contri butions to its funds are not neglected. The working men of the North have for some years recognised its usefulness by their financial support, and thanks to those charitably disposed in better circum- stances, the institution generally is in a good financial position. A number of ladies formed themselves into a committee for the purpose of promoting a ball in aid of the funds of the Infirmary. This committee consisted of Mrs. I. L. Bell, Mrs. Clayton, Mrs. Hoare, Miss Perkins, Mrs. Fred. Lamb, Mrs. Mather, Mrs. Wood, Mrs. D'Audibert, Mrs. T. W. Bulman, Mrs. E. Charlton, Mrs. Kenneth Bayley, Miss Dobson, Mrs. Dunn, Mrs. Philips, and Mrs. NewaU, with Messrs. John Anderson, of Saville Place, Newcastle, and A. H. Hunt, of Birtley, as secretaries. It was originally in- tended to make it a full dress and fancy ball, but the promoters found so many difficulties in the way of carrying out this combi- antion that they determined, rather than iuterfere with the success of the gathering to make it an ordinary full-dress assembly. The ball having found general favour throughout the two counties of Northumberland and Durham, there was an instant demand for tickets, over 800 having been sold at half a guinea each; this num- ber being considerably in excess of the most sanguine anticipations of all engaged in the movement, and certainly much larger than that obtained for any other subscription ball ever held in this town."], [152, "120 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [A.D. 1871 In addition, however, there were many who preferred to pay an increased charge of 15s. each at the door for admission, and, upon the whole, the appeal showed unmistakably the great and con tinued interest manifested in the affairs of the institution. The following ladies were patronesses of the assembly :\u2014 The Lady Wentworth ; the Lady Florence Cust ; the Hon. Lady Williamson ; the Hon.

Ridley, M.P., Mr. John Anderson, Mr. Norman Cookson, Mr. Hugh Fenwick, Mr. A. H. Hunt, and Mr. Hoare officiated as stewards. February 10. \u2014 This morning, a terrific gale from the east-south east, swept along the north-east coast with great fury, and lashed the sea into a perfect storm, rendering navigation a matter of con siderable difficulty and danger. A large number of vessels, which had been driven back into the Tyne by the gale of the early part of the week, took advantage of a change in the weather, and pro ceeded to sea. Early this morning, however, the sky became overcast, and between four and five o'clock, a strong breeze, accom panied by heavy drifting rain, sprang up from the east-south-east, and gradually freshened into a heavy gale. The sea rose rapidly, and soon commenced to break with great violence over Shields bar, causing considerable anxiety to all interested in the laden vessels which had left the port on the previous day. Upon the storm coming away, large numbers of persons assembled on the banks at Tynemouth to witness the arrival and return of vessels, and appre hending serious danger, the Volunteer Life Brigades of Tynemouth and South Shields mustered in force at their respective establish ments in readiness for action. The lifeboatmen and coastguards men also kept a good look-out. During the course of the morning, a number of vessels made for the harbour for shelter, and"], [153, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 121 got in safely. Between nine and ten o'clock, however, the brig Remembrance, from Blyth. was seen making from the northward, but as she was entering the harbour she encountered the full force of the gale, and being caught by a sudden squall, was turned on her broadside. The moment was painfully exciting, and it was with considerable pleasure that the spectators observed the vessel right herself, and get safely into harbour. Unfortunately, instead of abating, as many anticipated, the storm increased in intensity, and unhappily, before darkness set in, the gale was attended with most disastrous consequences, not only to life, but also to property. About half-past one o'clock, six or seven ships were seen in the offing running for the harbour, under sail, and as the storm was at this time exceedingly heavy, great anxiety was felt for their safety. They crossed the bar rapidly, but it was evidsnl they were some what too far north. One of the foremost \u2014 the schooner Jane Elliotson, of Whitstable \u2014 had not gone far before she struck on the rocks to the east of the Black Middens, from which position she was moved by the force of the gale, and drifted on to the Herd Sand. She, however, was taken in tow by a tug-boat, by which she was safely brought into the harbour. Very shortly after the brig Harvest, of Shields, grounded near the same place, and three of the crew jumped from the vessel into the Providence lifeboat, which stayed alongside until the vessel righted herself. This she did in the course of a minute or two, and the three seamen having returned to their ship she was taken into harbour in safety. The brig Lamba, of Sunderland, as she entered the harbour, just about the same time, had her stern stove right in by the broken water, but, notwithstanding this damage, and the dangerous position in which she was placed by it, she was safely navigated into port. The Thomas and Isabella, while passing the rocks near the Spanish Battery, had a narrow escape from grounding, having bumped against the rocks several times in her progress. These casualties, which were trifling compared with those which almost immediately followed, were but the precursors of the more serious results ofthe gale. As other vessels were seeu entering the harbour, their pro gress over the very much broken water was watched with grave apprehension aud anxiety. Three vessels being much too near the north shore were in an extremely dangerous situation, aud the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade, as well as those lifeboats be longing the port, having been alarmed by the sigual guns, were at once in full action. The first of these vessels to go ashore was the Orinoco, of Scarborough, a brig, Captain Courtenay, laden with coals. She grounded on the rocks below the Spanish Battery, and was followed immediately by the brig Cynthia Ann, of London. At once recognising the dangerous position of the two ships, the lifeboats of North and South Shields were launched to the rescue. The \"Tyne\" lifeboat, succeeded in getting alongside ofthe ill-fated vessels, which were lying close together, and contrived, by dint of great perseverance and after surmounting many difficulties, to p"], [154, "122 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1871 rescue the crews of both \u2014 seven from the Cynthia Ann, and six from the Orinoco. Scarcely had these poor fellows been saved when a brig, the Jabez, of Whitby, ran on to the rocks at the east end of the Black Middens, and immediately below the Spanish Bat tery. Her position was a most perilous one, and occasioned alarm to all who beheld her. The sea at this time was running very high, and was lashed by the gale into a furious state, the waves ever and anon enveloping the vessel, and the surf being driven like a shower of sleet on to the shore. The Jabez foundered about fifty yards from the north shore, in which position she was rocked to and fro by the power of the waves like a cradle. The spectators had a full view of the unfortunate vessel, and as it was seen that the crew crowded together on the deck in a terrified manner and shouted for help, great excitement began to manifest itself. The lifeboats at tempted to get near her, but, owing to the dangerous bottom, they dared not do so, and the anxiety for the safety of the crew increased every moment. In the meantime the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade had got their rocket apparatus into position, and a line was successfully thrown across the top-sail yard without delay. It was apparent, however, from the movements of the crew, that they did not understand the working ofthe appliance, for, instead of pro ceeding to secure the block-line, they be began hauling in the sea line, which had passed over the vessel with the rocket, as if they expected to find some instructions as to its use upon it. The position of the brig became every moment more perilous, and Mr. Quick, the chief officer of the Coast Guard, knowing that she could not live in such a place for many minutes, was determined to rescue the unfortunate men. He shouted repeatedly to the crew to make fast the block-line, but seeing that they could not understand him, he adopted a very ingenious method of communicating with them. Upon each block-line are certain instructions as to how the block is to be affixed to the mast, and in order that the crew might see these instructions, he attached a rocket to a block-line and fired it over the vessel with success. Just before this was done, however, the vessel capsized, and began to break up. The crew clung with a deathly grasp to the wreck, and seizing the rope which had been thrown to them lashed themselves to the wreck without at tempting to take advantage of the means afforded them of reaching the shore. The waves continued to wash completely over the remains of the brig, and an indescribable scene of excitement pre vailed amongst the spectators on the shore. Amidst this excite ment it was seen through the surf that one man had been washed away from the wreck, and fears were entertained that he was lost. He, however, seized one of the deck planks which were now floating about, and upon it providentially was washed ashore. A lad, appa rently an apprentice, was carried off the wreck by another wave, and he, too, seized upon a piece of floating timber, and was rescued by Mr. George Cuthbertson, a life brigade man. Four poor fellows, however, still remained on the largest portion of the wreck, and in"], [155, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 123 the course of two or three minutes two of them were washed off and sunk in the seething waters to rise no more. Amongst the specta tors on the shore there were a considerable number of ladies, who were deeply move by the sad scene, aud many of them ran about shouting frantically and weeping bitterly. Two fine-looking seamen still remained on the wreck of the ill-fated vessel, but it was evident that they, too, must perish. A short pause, and one of them was seen to slide down into the sea ; but his companion, who was appa- rently a very strong man, seized him, and held him for a moment or two. He was, however, compelled to relinquish his hold of his companion, who instantly shared the fate of his two brother seamen. The only man now remaining appeared to be entangled amongst the wreckage, and for a short while kept his head above water, but it was only for a short time, as he too speedily sank to the bottom, and little remained of the Jabez but splintered spars, rent sails, and tangled ropes. The two men who had been saved were at once attended to by a medical man at the Brigade House, and after hav- ing been given a change of dry clothiDg, were sent on to the Sailors' Home, at North Shields. The Jabez had sailed from the Tyne on the preceeding day for London, with a cargo of coals. She made a good passage as far as Flamborough Head, when she was caught in the gale, and was compelled to put back for refuge. The excite- ment caused by the terrible natuie of the events just narrated had scarcely had time to become allayed, when a cry was raised that another brig had grounded in Tynemouth Haven, close to the North Pier. This vessel proved to be the British Queen, of London. Her bulwarks were stove in by the fury of the storm as she entered the bat*, aud she drifted on to the point above stated. The Constance lifeboat, manned by a brave crew, at once went to the rescue, and getting alongside, the crew of the brig jumped from their vessel into the lifeboat. One of them, a son-in-law of the captain, on making the leap, was, by the motion of the boat, unable to reach it, and fell into the sea. Mr. Rowlands, on seeing the dangerous position in which his relative was placed, made an effort to rescue him, and in successfully doing so had his leg severely jammed be- tweenthe side of the lifeboat and that of the brig. This clever rescue on the part of the Constance crew had scarcely been accomplished befor the brig Valiant, of Jersey, grounded close to the British Queen in Tynemouth Haven. In crossing the bar she drove too far to the north, and had her yardarm carried away by coming in contact with the end of the North Pier. By skilful seamanship ou the part of the captain, however, she got in, but was caught by a sudden squall and driven ashore in the Haven. The lifeboats of Tynemouth and North and South Shields instantly put off to the rescue, and the crew were taken from the doomed ship and put on shore without delay, and safely housed in the Sailors' Home. About four o'clock the storm began to moderate, the sea fell very consi- derably, and a calm \u2014 compared with the gale that had raged during the former part of the day \u2014 prevailed. Before nightfall,"], [156, "124 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. the Orinoco, the Cynthia Ann, the British Queen, and the Valiant, in addition to the Jabez, were total wrecks, having all been com pletely broken by the action of the waves. The whole of the life boats of the port, together with their crews, nobly did their duty, and fully maintained their reputation. The Northumberland boat suffered much damage, and was stove in at the bows by the rocks ; and a new lifeboat, the Noble Institution, proved herself to be as fine a sea boat as any of those whi ch had been in use for some years past February 12. \u2014 A platelayer, named William Nattrass, belong ing to Trimdon Grange, died at the house of Mr. Bamlett, the Bay Horse Inn, West Sherburn, from the effects of exposure to the bitter cold weather which prevailed on the previous night. Deceased had been in Durham, and not arriving home,' search was made for him, when he was found at Bamlett's back door in an insensible condition. His little dog, in endeavouring to awake him from his lethargy, had scratched his face. February 13. \u2014 At the Darlington Workhouse, Mr. Dean, deputy coroner, held an inquest on the body of Charles O'Malley, who was stated to be about 48 years of age. The deceased, who had gone under this name, was identified by Frederick Jeffreys, tailor, who stated that he had known him in Edinburgh, when he wrote articles in the Reformer and other periodicals. He met him in the street at Darlington in a very destitute state, and took him to his lodgings in Park Gate. Deceased stated that he had scarcely tasted any food for three weeks. \u2014 George Latimer, who lodged in the same house as deceased, said he seemed very uneasy on the preceding night, and went to bed about seven ; but about twenty minutes after he came out and asked for a drink of water, when he went back to bed again. About nine o'clock it was found that O'Malley had hung himself by a rope fastened to a hook about eight feet from the floor. When found his feet were about three inches from the ground. He had been suffering from delirium tremens. \u2014 A verdict of \" Suicide during a state of temporary insanity\" was returned. February 13. \u2014 This morning, an inquest was held at the Royal Hotel, Tynemouth, by Mr. L. M. Cockcroft, coroner, on the body of a seaman belonging to the brig Jabez, wrecked at Tynemouth, on Friday, and which was found among the wreck of the vessel on Saturday. There was nothing upon the the body to identify it. It was that of a young man, about twenty-eight years of age, with light sandy whiskers, dark brown hair, and about five feet seven inches in height. There were no marks on the body by which it might be subsequently identified. It was not the body of either master or mate. Under these circumstances, the jury returned an open verdict, that the deceased was drowned by the wreck of the brig Jabez. The same day, a man named Charles Bell was com mitted to Morpeth Gaol for thirty-one days, by the North Shields"], [157, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS'. 125 borough bench, charged with stealing seamen's clothes from the shipwrecked vessels on Tynemouth Rocks. February 21. \u2014 This afternoon, the foundation stone of a new church in Cumberland Street, Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, was laid by R. L. Pemberton, Esq. There was a large gathering of the clergy of the district, as well as the public, to witness the ceremony, which was conducted in accordance with the forms of the Church of England. Dr. Yeld, on behalf of the Building Committee, pre sented a handsome silver trowel (the gift of Mr. G. H. Rennison) to Mr. Pemberton, who laid the stone in the customary manner. The Ven. Archdeacon Hamilton preached in the evening. The new edifice is built of freestone, finishedjin rock-faced Randon work, and is in the geometrical Gothic style. February 23. \u2014 This afternoon, the Finance Committee of the Newcastle Corporation met in the committee room, at the Town Hall, for the purpose of letting by auction the tolls and dues of the borough, for one year, in four lots. There was a numerous atten dance of competitors. The first lot was the thorough toll, which was commenced with a bid of \u00a32,800, and the bidding went briskly on, at \u00a310 a bid, up to \u00a33,970, the highest, which was made by Mr. Wm. Potts, of Newcastle, and the tolls included in the lot were let to him. Lot 2, the standage rents of the live cattle mar ket, was started at \u00a31,000 by Mr. Thomas Bower, of Leeds. When the bidding had got up to \u00a31,570, Mr. Gregson, on behalf of the Finance Committee, announced that it was then an open sale, after which the only bidders for the lot were Mr. Varty and Mr. Bower, the highest bid, \u00a31,610, being made by the last-named gentleman. The bidding for lot 3, the vegetable market standages, began at \u00a3700, and proceeded till it reached \u00a3920, which was offered by Mr. Bower, when it was stated that the reserve bid was \u00a31,200, and there was no further competition for the lot. The Corporation cranes formed the fourth and last lot, for which the reserve bid was \u00a32,500. The highest bid was \u00a31,600, which was made by Mr. John Simpson, consequently this lot, like the previous one, was not let. February 25. \u2014 A serious fire occurred this morning, on the esta blishment of Messrs. Allen and Sons, drapers and tailors, Market Place, Alnwick. About four o'clock in the morning, Mr. Cockburn, ironmonger, who resided in the next house, having occasion to be up, first observed the fire, and instantly gave the alarm, when it was discovered that the upper part of Messrs. Allen's house was completely on fire. Assistance was speedily procured, and an abundant supply of water being obtained, in about three hours the flames were entirely extinguished. The telegraph wires passed over the roof of the house, and were attached to a chimney, but being melted by the intense heat, were thrown to the ground, and rendered useless. The loss occassioned was roughly estimated at from \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000"], [158, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. 126 February 25. \u2014 Mr. William Carr was presented by the Mayor of South Shields, at the Life Brigade House on the South Pier, with a testimonial from the Royal Humane Society, for his gallantry in rescuing a young man named John Walters, from drowning at the Mill Dam. Mr. Carr's story is about as affecting a one as can well be narrated. He was master of a ship, but his vessel was burnt in Holland. He subsequently had a severe attack of fever, which left him in a weak state. He had just recovered when he was ap pointed to the command of a Wisbeach vessel. He had not made a voyage, however, and was returning from Newcastle, when he landed at the Mill Dam. He then saw a crowd gathering, and ran to see what was the matter, when he noticed Walters drowning in the water. He leaped to a craft, but fell short and broke his arm in three places. Nevertheless, he swam to Walters, and kept him up until a boat saved him. He was consequently unable to pro ceed to sea, and in the midst of his troubles, three of his family were laid up with the small pox. His limited resources soon be came exhausted, and he was in greatly straightened circumstances when the presentation was made, but a subscription being set on foot it met with a hearty response. February 27. \u2014 A lamentable accident occurred at Willington Station, on the Sunderland and Bishop Auckland Railway, by which a guard, named Thomas Burgess, lost his life, and another guard, named William Smart, had a narrow escape. The Bishop Auck land goods train had arrived at Willington, and prepared to shunt a truck on to the warehouse siding. The two guards in charge, Burgess and Smart, left their van, and the former uncoupled the truck in question from the engine, in order to make a flying shunt, and after loosening off the chain, he jumped on to the buffer and gave the signal to the man at the switches that all was in readiness. The pointsman accordingly gave the signal to the engine-driver, who started his tngine to run on to the main line. Directly the wheels of the locc motive were clear of the switches, the pointsman raised the latter in order to run the trucks on to the siding. It appeared, however, that, by some means, probably by the chains swinging, after they were unfastened, the hook on the locomotive had caught the chain on the waggon again, and instead of the latter running on to the siding after the points were raised, it fouled on the switches. Ihe waggon gave one lurch as the pressure of the locomotive came upon it, and then capsized on to the deceased, the engine almost instantly dragging the prostrated vehicle over him. The other guard, Smart, had been engaged on a similar duty at the other end of the same truck, and was also on a buffer when the engine started, but he was alarmed by feeling the jerk, and directly springing from his perch, reached the metals just in time to see the truck turn over on to his unfortunate companion, whose fate he would undoubtedly have shared but for his presence of mind. Smart was the first person to reach deceased after the accident. The poor fellow opened his eyes once, and then expired."], [159, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 127 The deceased was a native of Southport, but resided in Gateshead, and had only been iu the situation he held at the time of his death about a month. March 2. \u2014 This morning, about half-past one o'clock, Mr. Shotton, bacon factor, 28, Mosley Street, was killed by accidentally falling down stairs, at his residence, No. 9, Gloucester Terrace, Newcastle. March 2. \u2014 The mortal remains of General Beckwith,* K.H., of Silksworth, were interred in the Rock Cemetery, Houghton-le- Spring. The funeral procession, which consisted of a hearse, drawn by four horses, five mourning coaches, each drawn by two horses, and eleven private carriages and cabs, left Silksworth at half-past eleven o'clock, and proceeded, via East Herrington, to Houghton le-Spring. On the arrival of the mournful cortege at Houghton Church, near to which, as also on the road, a large number of persons had assembled, it was met by the Rev. Mr. Spoor, curate, who conducted the service, at the conclusion of which the \" Dead March\" from Saul was played upon the organ. The corpse was again consigned to the hearse, and conveyed to the cemetery, where, previously to be lowered into the grave, four garlands of red and white camilias, heaths, &c, were placed on the coffin by the brothers and nephew of the deceased. March 2. \u2014 This morning, a most destructive and alarming fire broke out on the premises of Mr. B. Stephenson, at Deanery Farm, South Church, near Bishop Auckland, which resulted in the destruction of \u00a3500 worth of property. The fire was caused by a lighted candle carried by a farm servant falling among and setting fire to some straw in the barn. March 9. \u2014 Died, at his seat, Melton Constable, Norfolk, in his 49th year, Lord Hastings. The barony of Hastings, created by Edward I. in 1290 having fallen into abeyance, the House of Peers reported that Henry L'Estrange Styleman Le Strange, Esq., Hunstanton, county Norfolk, and Sir Jacob Astley, Bart , were co heirs thereto, whereupon Sir Jacob had the abeyance terminated in his favour, and was summoned to Parliament by writ as Baron Hastings, on the 18th of May, 1841, his lordship's tenants at Sea ton Delaval afterwards celebrating the event by a dinner at the Queen's Arms, Season Sluice. His lordship died on the 27th of December, 1859, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Jacob Henry Delaval, whose death is now announced. His lordship, who was in his 49th year, was a Liberal in politics. He succeeded his father to the title in 1859, and was married in 1860 to Frances, daughter of Mr. T. Gosham, of Clifton. He was Deputy-Lieutenant for Nor folk, Hon. Colonel of the Norfolk Militia Artillery, and was formerly an officer in the Life Guards.

The Mayor (Mr. G. Bell) presided, and was supported on his right by Messrs. C. U. Laws, J. Dryden, S. Mease, John Elliott, M. W. Lambert, Thomas Gibson, H. Clarke, G. Cleugh, A. Strong, and A. Brown. On his left, by Rev. E. Mason, Rev. T. Featherstone, Messrs. W. Crighton, R. Muckle (bailiff* to his Grace the Duke of Northumberland), R. W. Surtees, Thos. Thomp son (secretary), J. Short. The vice-chairs were occupied by Messrs. George Storey and John Wilson. The room was tastefully decor ated, and on one of the sides was a scroll bearing on it the words, \" Long life and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Laws \" There was suspended from the walls at the head of the room a copy of the address presented to Mr. C. U. Laws, beautifully illuminated and engrossed in vellum, and enclosed in a splendid gilt frame. The presentation, which was accompanied by a suitable address, was made on behalf of the subscribers by Mr. Thomas Thompson, of Whitley Hill Heads. \u2014 The service was a very valuable one, and richly chased. On the coffee tray was engraved the following in scription : \u2014 \" Presented, with a tea and coffee service, to Cuthbert Umfreville Laws, Esq., by the tenantry of the Duke of Northum berland, and other friends in the Manor of Tynemouth, as a token of their sincere regard and esteem, at the close of a connection of forty years, during which he has acted as bailiff of the Manor, and agent of his grace. 13th March, 1871.\" March 15. \u2014 The corner stone of a new church, dedicated to St. Mark, for the district of Millfield, one of the four created ecclesi astical districts under the Bishopwearmouth Rectory Bill, was laid this day by Mrs. John Hartley, in the presence of some hundreds of spectators. The style of the building is a modernised Gothic, and its interior built entirely of Prudham stone. The church con sists of a nave and two aisles ; the height to the ridge being forty feet ; and the roof of lofty pitch, open and stained, without any plaster. Four arches, supported by columns and responds (the capitals of which are finely carved), separates the aisles from the nave. The end is circular in form, lighted by five tall lancet win dows, filled with stained glass ; while the flooring is of tiles, and the aisles of the church of coloured tiles. Choir seats, of cathedral pattern, are introduced into the chancel. An organ chamber, vestry, and cellar is formed, the latter for the heating apparatus. The pulpit, a special donation, is of stone, and a carved stone font is placed at the west end. The church will accommodate 600 per sons ; the seats being open benches of stained pine. A porch and double doors at the west end forms the principal entrance. The building cost about \u00a32,800, towards which sum Mr. Aid. Hartley contributed \u00a31,000, aud the Wear Glass Works firm (Messrs. Hartleys and Kayll's), \u00a3500.

Here, a full choral service, conducted by the vicar of St. Mark's, was gone through, and a collection in aid of the building fund was made at the close. The service over, the large assembly made for the new site, where the important ceremony of laying the stone was gone through. A large wooden platform had been raised for the accommodation of those immedi- ately connected with the proceedings, and was taken possession of by the clergy, choir (the latter wearing their surplices), and the other processionists bearing aloft banners, inscribed with religious mottoes in Latin, and crosses, rfec. \u2014 Mr. Henry Ritson, in stepping forward to address Mrs. Hartley, said he was extremely glad to think that, when the lady who at first wras expected to be with them that day could not be present, a substitute could be found within the circle of her own family to whom the duty could be delegated without any fear as to its success. He then referred to Mrs. Hartley's cherished ideas for the amelioration of the condition of the workman, and concluded byT hoping St. Mark's would largely contribute to that end in such a populous locality. He then pre sented the silver trowel to Mrs. Hartley, who went through the usual ceremonial, declaring the stone to be well and truly laid. March 15. \u2014 An interesting event took place in the Town Hall, Durham, the occasion being the presentation of a testimonial to Mrs. Wm. Henderson, the wife of Mr. Wm. Henderson, brother to the senior representative of the city of Durham in Parliament, and one of the partners in the firm of Messrs. Henderson and Co., car pet manufacturers, by the parents of the children attending the schools connected with the carpet manufactory and other workmen of the above firm. Mrs. Wm. Henderson had always taken a warm interest in everything connected with the factory operatives, but more particularly in the schools for the young, and in the sick and those in distress. Under the new Education Act, the schools which had been for years established at the carpet manufactory had been transferred to the parochial schools of the parish of St. Nicholas, and to mark the event of their passing from beneath the fostering care of Mrs. Henderson, the parents of the scholars and other people determined to raise a testimonial, as a mark of their gratitude to that lady. The gift selected consisted of a handsomely chased silver tray, bearing the crest of Mr. and Mrs. William Henderson, and also the following inscription \u2014 \u2022\" Presented to Mrs. William Henderson, together with an illuminated address, by the parents of the children attending the late factory schools, and other employees of the factory, as a memorial from 450 sincere friends of their esteem and regard, which she has so deservedly won by the interest she has taken in promoting the education and spiritual welfare of their children, and also of her generous and Christian sympathy with the afflicted and bereaved. \u2014 Durham, Q"], [162, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871 130 March 15th, 1871.\" The address referred to was a handsomely illuminated and engrossed document, mounted in a gilded frame, the border bearing the weavers' arms at the top, and the arms of Mr. and Mrs. William Henderson on each side. The hall was crowded in every part by the operatives and their friends. The proceedings commenced with a concert given by the members of the Factory Choral Society. The presentation was made by Mr. Daniel Mackay, assisted by Mr. Wm. Alexander, the latter being the oldest operative in the service of Messrs. Henderson and Co., having served that firm for a period of fifty years.\u2014 Mrs. Henderson replied in suitable terms in accepting the testimonial. \u2014 Mrs. Henderson, both on entering and on leaving the platform, was loudly cheered by the audience. March 16. \u2014A fire of a somewhat alarming character occurred in the works of the Newcastle Gas Company, this morning, but it was fortunately extinguished before any serious damage was sustained. While a number of boilers were being used for converting tar into pitch, one of them suddenly began to leak in such a way as to allow the inflammable material to become ignited, and hence it speedily began to blaze with great fury, and to cause not a little consterna tion amongst the workpeople. A quantity of refuse lime was promptly secured, and its application to the burning tar soon put an end to all fears of the conflagration spreading. Dense volumes of black smoke continued to be emitted for some time, and as these alarmed the policemen on duty near the spot, they hastened for the assistance of the fire engines kept at the Westgate and Manors Stations. The members of the different brigades lost no time in their preparations, but when they reached the works their services were not required. March 27. \u2014 An accident occurred at Brancepath Old Pit, by which the life of one man was sacrificed, while another had a very narrow escape. For some time past water had been gaining rapidly in certain parts of the pit, and the usual means of dams had been resorted to in order to prevent it from flooding the workings. This evening, just after Mr. Wood, the viewer, had left the place, and when only two deputy-overmen, named Edward Brown and Brown Hodgson, were in that part of the mine, the water suddenly burst away through the barriers put up, sweeping all before it. Brown Hodgson succeeded in reaching a place of safety, but his companion, less fortunate, was unable to escape from the progress of the destroying element. Instant efforts were adopted, on the nature of the accident becoming known, to stop the progress of the water and to recover the body of the unfortunate man. The for mer operation was completed, and the body of Brown recovered. March 28. \u2014 Died, at the age of 77 years, Mr. Robert Emery.

The event occurred a few weeks previous to this date, and the greatest joy was manifested not only by the noble families concerned, but by the whole of the tenantry and re tainers on the various estates in this country. In order that the birth of the young Lord Warkworth might be celebrated in a fit ting manner, arrangements were made for providing the tenantry in the different bailiwicks with a good substantial dinner. No fewer than 400 of the principal farmers on His Grace's land were invited to dine in the castle at Alnwick, while other large spreads were held at Tynemouth, Ovingham, and Bellingham. In the smaller villages, also, the people were granted various sums of money through a committee, and then had it expended over a tea, a supper, or a ball, just as the fancy of the majority might dictate. Festivities of this kind took place at Denwick, Longhoughton, Rennington, Lesbury, Warkworth, Shilbottle, Acklington, South Charlton, Beanley, Chatton, Lucker, Newham, Kirkwhelpington, Ingoe, Barrasford, Horsley, Walbotlle, Newburn, Cullercoats, Back worth, and Earsdun. March 30. \u2014 Immense crowds of people, blocking up Park Gate, Darlington, assembled opposite the house of Mr. Maddison, against one end of which Mr. Silversides, an adjoining property owner, had placed large poles aud blocks of wood to effectually fasten up three small windows, one above the other. Mr. Maddison had previously hung outside his house a board, with the inscription painted \u2014 \" Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour's landmark,\" and also stuck up written protests against his neighbour's action. These not having the desired effect, some person from the inside of his house, with the blinds down so that only a hand and saw could be"], [168, "132 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. seen, cut the obstructions from one of the windows, Mr. Silversides running up and down a ladder, vainly endeavouring to discover the perpetrator. For several hours the large crowd assembled watched this unusual contest, the honours of the day eventually resting with Mr. Maddison, who had obtained light through the two upper windows. On the following day the contest re-com mehced, and lasted most of the day, the object being to raise the obstruction from the foundation. For this purpose the cellar win dow was utilised, and a man, with his face masked, worked inside with such energy as gradually to loosen the large masses of wood, which, as they were dislocated, were drawn by a rope to the upper window and thrown down, the whole obstruction being ultimately knocked down, amidst the cheering and hooting of the assembled crowd. Three flags were then hung out to celebrate the victory. The affair created infinite amusement throughout Darlington, where both parties were well known. March 30. \u2014 A painful case of suicide occurred at Middleton-in- Teesdale. Mr. Joseph Pattison, agent of the London Lead Mining Company, residing at Hude, arose, had breakfast, and read a por tion of Scripture, and had family prayers. He afterwards went out, and appears to have gone straight into the stable, put off his coat, vest, and neckerchief, and deliberately cut his throat. Shortly after his wife went into the stable and discovered the ghastly spec tacle. He was in a kneeling position, with his face on the ground, and quite dead. His clothes were laid in the corner, and the razor with which he had committed the awful deed was lying beside him, as was also a note written with a pencil on a slip' of paper. It was very illegible, but it was in the form of a farewell address to his wife and family. No reason could be assigned for the perpetration of the horrible deed, but for some days previous he had been very strange in manner. March 31. \u2014 The brethren of the Northern Provinces met at Sunderland to consecrate a Mark Mason's Lodge, being the second which had been established in the province of Northumberland and Durham. Earl Percy, M.P., the D.G.M. of England, and R.W.G.P.M. of Northumberland and Durham, presided at the ceremony of the consecration.

April 3. \u2014 One of the most venerable of our Northumbrian patri archs, the bearer of a familiar and respected name, died this morning, among his native hills, in the 96th year of his age. Born on Sun day, the 9th of July, 1775, he lived to be numbered in the Census of Sunday, April 2, 1871. Robert Donkin, of Ingram on the Brea mish, was a native of Great Tosson, near Rothbury, within ten or a dozen miles of the farm which he had occupied for three-score years and five. He was the last remaining member of the family of Samuel Donkin, of Great Tosson, who died in St. John's Lane, Newcastle, in 1794, in the 64th year of his age, having come to this town to undergo a surgical operation. Samuel Donkin was one of the most intelligent, active, and successful men of his age, farming extensively under the Duke of Portland, at that time owner of the barony of Hepple. An ardent sportsman, he kept for many years the famous Tosson fox-hounds. He was the namesake of his father, who died at Great Tosson, in 1791, his age being 102. After the sale of the Hepple barony by the Duke of Portland, Robert Donkin, then farming Ryehill and other lands, entered upon the extensive farm of Ingram, and settled there for life. He married in 1798, some years prior to his removal, his half-cousin, Susan, daughter of William Donkin, of Lorbottle, who died in her 88th year, on the 5th of January, 1867, after a happy union of about sixty-nine years. There had been no death in the hospitable old farm-house at Ingram for upwards of sixty years ; and she left eleven children behind her. Her husband was a man whom Sir Walter Scott would have delighted to portray. One of the most thoroughly domesticated of men that ever lived, he was temperate, frugal, and in all things punctual and faithful. He was passionately attached to sheep- farming, and to the society of shepherds, chroni clers of the storms and events ofthe Cheviots. More a father, than a master to those around him, many of the second and third gener ation died in his service. He had no strong political feelings, but a veneration, warm and deep, for the habits and usages of his fathers. April 10. \u2014 The very handsome and commodious edifice built in connection with Bath Lane Church, Newcastle, for school purposes, was inaugurated by the Mayor of the borough, Mr. R. B. Sander son. Prior to its occupation by day and Sunday scholars, the building had been furnished so aa to form a very interesting and"], [170, "134 . HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. instructive polytechnic exhibition, aud accommodation had also been afforded for the holding of a bazaar in aid of the building fund. The structure is not unworthy to be classed with some of the most ornamental buildings in Newcastle, and it stands out conspicuously in a neighbourhood where architectural embellishments are scant. The cost of the schools, including furnishing, were \u00a33,000. The inaugural ceremony was celebrated by a grand bazaar. The hall was elegantly and profusely decorated with flags and plants, and presented a very gay appearance. Mottoes and devices appropriate to the occasion and to the purpose of the building were also dis played around the room, and the ingenuity of the decorators (Mr. Crighton and Mr. Curry), had been made conspicuously manifest in many other directions where embellishment had been desirable. April 10. \u2014 This evening, a successful gathering of parishioners took place in the large Parish School at Dunstan, near Gateshead. A sumptuous tea was provided by the ladies residing in the neigh bourhood, the object being to provide funds for the Church of England mission there. After tea, a meeting was held, the Rev. H. B. Carr, Rector of Whickham, in the chair. The rev. chairman, after complimenting them on the handsome manner in which the ladies had come forward to assist in the good work by providing tea, said they came forward with equal readiness to cater for their amusement by providing, along with the Blaydon Choral Union, a most liberal programme of vocal as well as instrumental music. He then briefly stated the object of the meeting, and said he was sure the Rev. Mr. who had worked so earnestly in his district, would feel some reward for his labour to have such a successful response to his call for help. The programme was gone through with much credit to the performers and great delight and amusement to the audience. April 11. \u2014 The corner stone of a new United Presbyterian place of worship, to be named St. Stephen's, was laid this afternoon at Monkwearmouth, by Mr. Aid. Givens, in the presence of an exceedingly large assemblage. The site is situated at the north end of Wearmouth Bridge, in Bonner's Field, and immediately opposite the new Savings' Bank. The church is built of brick, with ornamental stone facings, and its front is in the Grecian style. Its dimensions are 40 feet by 80 feet ; to the eaves, 44 feet ; and its extreme height, 60 feet. The building will accommodate 600 persons, and, including a schoolroom underneath, cost \u00a32,015. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. Aid. Givens, and among those present were, the Revs. J. Morris, J. Parker, J. Black, Miles, Mathi son, Wallace, Savery Neil, Sunderland ; Rev. R. Brown, Newcastle ; Rev. B. J. Carruthers, Longtown ; Aid. Tyzack, Councillors William Wilson and Preston, and Messrs. Johnson, Harle, F. Bowey, R. Mclntyre, &c, and a large number of ladies. After the ceremony, a dinner was held in the Royal Hotel, Monkwearmouth, Mr. Aid. Givens occupying the chair, aud Mr. J. Younger the vice-chair."], [171, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 135 April 11. \u2014 A grand bazaar of useful and ornamental articles was held in the Mechanics' Institute, South Shields, in aid of funds for the restoration of Holy Trinity Church, South Shields. The hall was very elegantly decorated for the occasion, aud the stalls, which were arranged on the floor, were overcrowded with a very choice selection of articles of beauty and use. The ceremony of opening the bazaar was performed by the Mayor, who declared the bazaar open, and in doing so he sincerely hoped that it would realise all their expectations. April 12. \u2014 Died, at his residence, in Newcastle, Mr. Richard Ayre, aged 77 years. The deceased gentleman was in his usual health when he arose and partook of breakfast, but shortly after- wards he complained of a pain in his chest, and went to bed again. His friends immediately sent for Dr. Charlton, who promptly attended, but the deceased had then expired, the cause of death being heart disease. Mr. Ayre was a native of Kenton, near New- castle, in which locality his father was a colliery engineman. When a youth he served part of bis time as a moulder, and then was engaged as butler to Mr. Thomas Cookson, near Chester-le- Street. A few years afterwards he went into partnership with his brother, who kept the Tiger Inn, in the Close. Subsequently he became host of the Charles XII., at the end of the Tyne Bridge, where he lived for a considerable period. From there he removed to the Grapes Inn in the Side, of which house he was landlord for many years. When quite a young man he commenced to take an active part in movements of a political and social character, and throughout his career he was a warm advocate of Liberal principles, and an earnest supporter of all measures calculated to promote the welfare of the working classes. During the time he kept the Grapes Inn, a debating society was held there, and amongst the members who used to meet regularly for the discussion of political questions, were Sir John Fife, Mr. Thomas Doubleday, Mr. Charles Larkin, and other local reformers. The deceased gentleman was one of the earliest and warmest supporters of the co-operative movement in the North, and in his latter years he always referred with pride and gratification to the manner in which the principle was taken up and adopted throughout the district. He was an earnest admirer and an attached friend of Mr. Robt. Owen, and when the latter first visited Newcastle and lectured in the old Music Hall, in Blackest Street, Mr. Ayre officiated as his chairman. When Mr. Owen paid another visit to the town, and delivered a lecture in the Nelson Street Lecture Room, Mr. Ayre again presided. At this meeting, great bitterness of feeling, arising from religious differences, was manifested by a number of Irishmen amongst the audience, and one of them persisted to such an extent in inter rupting the proceedings, as to rouse the indignation of those who were sitting near him, and he was very severely handled. There upon a friend of the injured man slipped out of the meeting, and proceeded to Sandgate, where he soon collected a large number of"], [172, "[a.d. 1871. 136 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF sympathisers, who proceeded in a body, armed with sticks and other weapons, to the Lecture Room, the door of which they forced open, and in a few minutes dispersed the meeting. In after years Mr. Ayre was regularly appointed chairman at the meetings held by the Secularist society. Though holding strong opinions on political and social questions, he never obtruded them upon others, but was always ready to defend them when called upon to do so. His genial disposition, unselfishness, integrity and straightforward ness, and uniform upright conduct throughout the whole course of his life, won for him the esteem of all who knew him ; and eveu those who differed widely from him regarded him as a sterling man. Mr. Ayre was of a mechanical turn of mind, and displayed consider able ingenuity in several contrivances, including a self-extinguishing safety lamp, and a pump on a new principle, which he invented. The latter piece of mechanism was exhibited at the first Polytech nic Exhibition held in Newcastle in the year 1840. April 15. \u2014 Died suddenly, in the 45th year of his age, the Right Hon. John Robert Davison, M.P. for the city of Durham, and Judge- Advocate General. The medical evidence at the inquest showed that death was caused by disease of the heart. The sad event took place when on a visit to his friend, Mr. J. St. George Burke, Q.C., Sudbury, Suffolk. April 18. \u2014 The first meeting of the creditors of Amelia Radcliffe, commonly known as the \" Countess of Derwentwater,'' of Newlands Grange Farm, was held at the Newcastle County Court, before Mr. Registrar Mortimer. Mr. J. C. Fenwick, the solicitor acting in the bankruptcy, was present, and represented three creditors. The Countess was adjudicated bankrupt at the previous County Court, after fruitless attempts had been made to bring her to the court to answer a debtor's summons for \u00a3582, the judgment for which had been obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench at the suit of the Lords of the Admirality. Mr. Fenwick represented the Commis sioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of England, and also two other creditors, Mr. John Hare, farmer, Highfield, and the Messrs. Thompson, of Fairlie, the claims of the three, who formed a quorum of the creditors, amounting to \u00a3620. The amount of her liabilities was stated to be between \u00a32,000 and \u00a3 3,000, but the largest creditor had not tendered any proof. The \" Countess\" did not appear in person, nor yet through any solicitor April 19. \u2014 This afternoon, a thunderstorm of considerable inten sity broke over Durham and neighbourhood. The atmosphere had been close and sultry during the afternoon, a few gleams of sunshine breaking through the watery sky about four o'clock, followed, how ever, by a thick, murky atmosphere, which by a little after five had become so intense as to render objects invisible at a few yards dis tance. About half-past five o'clock, a vivid flash of lightning shot out of t he sky from the south-west, followed by a loud peal of thunder, and from this time up to six o'clock flashes of lightning,"], [173, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 137 followed by thunder, came in rapid succession, a heavy down-pour or rain commencing as the storm moved off in apparently an easterly direction. In the country, the burns rapidly swelled, and over flowed on the adjoining lands, while low-lying roads were all but impassable to foot pasengers from the heavy accumulations of water which quickly gathered on them. In Durham, a heavy volume of water, as if a brook had been subverted, drove down Western Hill on to the North Road, the latter thoroughfare and adjoining streets having all the appearance of immense rivers as the water rushed down to the lower levels. Gilesgate, Claypath, and New Elvet presented a similar appearance, and the water in the bed of the river Wear also soon rose bank-high. April 26. \u2014 In the Court of Probate, before Lord Penzance, the case of De Butts (by his guardian) v. D'Este, was disposed of. The plaintiff, Edward De Butts, by his guardian, Hannah Georgina Elizabeth D'Audibert, propounded the will and two codicils of the late William Wharton Burdon ; and the defendant propounded the draft of a third codicil, made after the first one, and before the second one. The testator was a large proprietor of colliery pro perty in the north of England, especially near Newcastle on-Tyne. He had resided at 7, Saville Place, Newcastle, and had also a resi dence in London. His death took place on the 24th of June, 1870, and under his will he left the greater portion of his property to the plaintiff, who was his cousin, and was educated at Sandhurst, and was in the 1 7th Lancers ; and, by a second c\u00bbdicil, an annuity of \u00a350 a year was left to the defendant, a lady residing at Trumping ton Street, Cambridge. The testator was a man of artistic attain ments, and had a picture in the Fitzwilliam Institution, Cambridge, and from that circumstance arose his acquaintance with Mrs. D'Este, who was very kind to him. He was very friendly with her, and frequent correspondence passed between them. He had also shown her the codicil in question, but after his death it could not be found, although every search had been made where it was reasonable to expect to find such a paper. The suit was not instituted in an un friendly spirit, but the trustees of the plaintiff felt themselves bound to come to the court for a declaration as to whether the codicil had been revoked. It was added that the plaintiff would inherit a for tune of about \u00a3150,000. \u2014 Evidence having been heard on both sides, Lord Penzance said that he did not judge from the evidence and the letters in the case that the deceased did not at the last intend to benefit the defendant, and he should, therefoi e, pronounce for the will and the whole of the codicils, and the costs would come out of the estate. April 27. \u2014 This evening, Mr. Theodore Hoyle, deputy-coroner, held an inquest at the house of Mr. Kyle, Crown Inn, Bentinck, Newcastle on-Tyne, on the body of John Carruthers, aged 25 years, son of Mr. James Carruthers, of Benwell High Cross Farm. The deceased and his father had some words, in consequence of which R"], [174, "138 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [A.D. 1871 he left his home. About seven o'clock the following morning he was found lying asleep inside the railings which enclose the shaft of an old pit situated in a field in front of Benwell High Cross House, by a man named Lewis Oliver, who raised him up and accompanied him a short way towards his home. Oliver afterwards heard that he was missing, and called and told his father where he had seen him. A man named Henry Hair descended the 'pit shaft, and found the body of the deceased at the bottom. The jury returned a verdict of \" Found dead.\" April 28.\u2014 Mr. Wharton was this day elected Member of Par liament for the city of Durham in the place of the Right Hon. John Robert Davidson, deceased. Contrary to general expectation, the result of the poll was announced to be declared at five o'clock, and at that time there were not fewer than between 4,000 and 5,000 spectators assembled in front of the Town Hall. They were noisy, good humoured, and exceedingly demonstrative ; and the scene presented by the waving ribbons, the floating streamers, and the constant movements of the gaily dressed throng, was of the most animated and attractive character. Most of the windows, too, were graced by groups of ladies ; and, therefore, as the two candi dates marched from their committee-rooms, they were not only greeted by the cheers of their friends below, but were flattered aud encouraged by the smiles of their graceful admirers above. The Mayor (Mr. Aid. Ward) announced that the numbers received for Mr. Wharton were 814, and for Mr. Thompson 776. This showed a majority of 38 for the former gentleman, and he therefore declared him duly elected to serve in Parliament as member for the city of Durham. Mr. Wharton and Mr. Thompson (the defeated candi date) afterwards addressed the assemblage. May 1. \u2014 This morning, at half-past five o'clock, the Redheugh Bridge over the fiver Tyne was thrown open to foot passengers for the first time. There was no ceremony observed on the occasion ; but during the day the directors ofthe company walked across and inspected various parts of the bridge. While a boat race between Bagnall and Hepplewhite was being rowed (which was won by the former), there wTere about 700 persons on the bridge, from whence a good view of the course from the start to the Meadows could be obtaiued. A number of other persons also passed over the new erection, and toll representing upwards of two thousand passengers was taken during the day. May 1. \u2014 This afternoon, two men were drowned off the Pier, South Shields, by the upsetting of a salmon fishing-boat. A strong north-east sea prevailed off the coast, and some half-dozen salmon fi-shing-boats, manned by two or three men, took up their station in the bay to the south of the Pier, and, as usual, the whole of the men kept their boats as close into the shore as the breaking of the seas would allow them. One of the boats was manned by Messrs. James Scott, Michael Pope, and James Clarke,"], [175, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. and about half-past one o'clock, after the salmon-net had been cast, it drifted too far in-shore, and was tossed about by the broken' water. The men had the oars washed away, and the boat was almost immediately upset and the three men thrown into the sea. The crews in the other boats and some men on shore at once pro ceeded to render assistance, and, after some time, James Scott, residing at the Mill-Dam, was taken out of the sea and conveyed to the Life Brigade House, where the appliances of the house were put into requisition, and was brought round. The bodies of the other two unfortunate fishermen were afterwards found and con veyed to the Dead House. May 2.\u2014 A very pleasing ceremony took place in Newcastle this day, when the friends of the Rev. George Gilfillau, of Dundee, invited him to a public breakfast in the Neville Hotel, and pre sented him with a number of valuable books in acknowledgment of the many kind services he had rendered to the neighbourhood. The repast, which was of the choicest description, was partaken of by a considerable number of friends, amongst them being the Rev. Mr. Morris, Sunderland ; the Rev. Robert Brown, Newcastle ; the Rev. J. G. Potter, Newcastle ; the Rev. William Walters, Newcastle ; Mr. Councillor Joseph Cowen, Mr. Councillor Curry, Captain Lawrence, Mr. Robert White, Mr. T. Y. Strachan, Mr. T. N. Brown, Mr Frank Carr, Mr. Stewart, Mr. James McKendrick, Mr. Easton, Mr. Rea, and several other gentlemen. May 3. \u2014 A new organ of great power and beauty, built by Messrs. Nicholson and Co., of Newcastle, was opened in Holy Trinity Church, North Shields, this day. The organ cost \u00a3450, and con tained stops which had only been recently introduced. The fine qualities of the instrument were brought out by Mr. Rea and Mr. Leggatt, who officiated during the services, which were highly appreciated by crowded congregations. May 3. \u2014 A very sad casualty, the occurrence of which threw a deep gloom over the neighbourhood, occurred in Hartlepool Bay. Five young men, whose names were William Huntley, John MoGill, John Huutley, James Marshall, and Alexander Callender, the first four of whom were from 18 to 20 years of age, and the latter about 15, went out of West Hartlepool Harbour, about a quarter-past seven, for a row in the Bay, with a very light built four-oar racing gig, which they all owned in partnership. The weather, although calm at the moment, was considered by experienced men so unfit for such an excursion that they received more than one warning from the pilots not to incur the risk; but, being blind to their danger, these hints were disregarded. They had scarcely been away half an hour when a sudden squall swept over the locality, and which, although brief in duration, seriously jeopardised their position. They, however, managed to weather it in their frail craft, and were seen safely rowing about nearly an hour later. At nine o'clock a pilot, named Michael Coulson, passed them ill his"], [176, "140 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. coble, near to the Stone Buoy, then apparently all safe ; but from that moment nothing positive could be learned respecting them, and finding that they did not return as evening wore on, the father of Marsha 11, who acted as deputy harbour master, determined to have a run out with the steam-tug William Charles, in search of the lads. They learned nothing of them until nearly twelve o'clock, when they encountered two pilots, in their coble, between the Stone Buoy and the end of the Lcngscar Rock, towing the ill fated skiff, bottom upwards, they having just previously picked it up as it drifted near them, but were unable to find any traces of its un fortunate occupants, who, without doubt, had met with a watery grave. May 6. \u2014 This afternoon, about five o'clock, a most fearful col lision took place off the bar of the Tyne, in which a fine new steamer was sunk and entirely lost. The David Burn, a new steamship of 1,200 tens, and fitted up with all modern improve ments in machinery, and the property of Messrs. D. Burn, Robert Hindbaugh, and partners, of the Quayside, Newcastle, was announced to make her trial trip. The steamer left the entrance to the Tyne Dock about three o'clock in the afternoon, with a party of about fifty ladies and gentlemen on board. Amongst the com pany were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hindhaugh and friends, Newcastle ; Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Bentham, Newcastle ; Mr. and Mrs. John Young, Newcastle ; Mr Limpricht, Newcastle ; Mr. Johnson, New castle ; Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, Newcastle ; Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Taylor, Newcastle ; Mr. and Mrs. Cheesman, Newcastle ; Mr. and Mrs. Miller and two children, Newcastle; Mr. and Miss Doeg, Newcastle; Mr. Nothwanger, Newcastle; Mr. Chapman, South Shields ; Mrs. Kirkup, Sunderland ; Mr. and Mrs. Hunter, New castle ; Mr. J. G Campbell, marine print artist, Sunderland ; Mr. and Miss Hoskins, Gateshead; Mr. J. H. Forster, Sunderland ; and Mr. W. T. Baldwin, marine artist, Sunderland. The vessel proceeded down the river, and went out to sea for a trial trip, the weather being delightfully fine, and the sea smooth. The steamer had been to sea little more than an hour and a half, when she was enveloped in a dense fog, and she brought up about a mile south east of the harbour to lay until it cleared away. About five o'clock, while lying in the same position, the party on board the steamer were thrown into the greatest state of alarm by seeing a vessel which proved to be the screw-steamer Earl Percj', which had left the harbour with the tide to proceed to London with goods and passengers, emerge from out of the fog close upon them. When first seen, the Earl Percy appeared to be about 150 yards off, and was bearing right down upon them under a full head of steam. The captain of the David Burn, Mr. Esson, and Mr. Tinmouth, the pilot, were on the bridge to get the engine of the David Burn underway, but before this could be done the Earl Percy struck her amidships on the starboard side with a tremendous crash. The Earl Percy was well down in the water, and the blow took effect"], [177, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 141 upon the David Burn to a large extent below the water line. The plates and side were completely stove in where she was struck. The London steamer lay with her stem on beside the David Burn, and the master kept the engine going slowly to keep her in that position until the people were taken off the David Burn. Soon after the blow had been struck the cry was raised that the David Burn was sinking. The visitors on board the new vessel had been considerably knocked about by the collision, and several of the ladies were precipitated on to the deck, but none were hurt. The ladies were hurried on to the bridge, and rapidly passed from the David Burn to the Earl Percy, amid a scene of frightful excitement. Dresses were torn, bonnets and hats were lost, and most ofthe ladies found themselves on board the Eary Percy in a fearfully dilapidated condition. As soon as the female passengers were safe, the gentle men and crew and workpeople were passed on board the Earl Percy, and the last man had just got scrambled up the bows of the latter, when the David Burn, which had been rapidly filling with water, gave a lurch and sank stern foremost. Before that occurred the Earl Percy had backed clear of her. The David Burn went down in deep water, and when the Earl Percy drifted away from her into the fog, the last that was seen of her was the tops of her masts, and the flags upon them flying level with the water. The only living thing that went down with her was a little dog, and no one was hurt but the man at the wheel, who was struck by the wheel flying round when the vessels came into collision. When the party were all gathered on board the Earl Percy they found the officers, sea men, and passengers on board that vessel in as great a state of ex citement as themselves, as the Earl Percy was a good deal stove about the bows, and she was well immersed in the water with her cargo. Fears were entertained that she might sink also, but the men kept their terrors to themselves, and, fortunately, in the emer gency the steamtug Rambler cast up. She got alongside, and the visitors and people from on board the David Burn were passed on board the Rambler, though at the peril of some of the ladies falling into the sea, and the party were brought up the river and landed at the New Quay, where the torn dresses of the ladies, the Joss of bonnets and other articles of attire, with the hatless appearance of some of the gentlemen attracted a good deal of attention. They proceeded to the North Shields Railway station, and left by the half-past six train for their homes in Newcastle. The Earl Percy returned to the Tyne, and brought up off one of the tiers at the New Quay. She landed her passengers, and underwent repairs. The David Burn, was intended for the coal trade between Newcastle and London. Her registered tonnage was 700, length 200 feet, breadth 29 feet, depth 16 feet, and her engines, of 90 horse-power, were by Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay, and Sons. She was valued at \u00a314,000, and had been insured with Mr. Miller, of Newcastle, and Mr. Hunter, of North Shields, only at noon on the day of her trial trip."], [178, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. 142 May 12. \u2014 This morning, a little before four o'clock, an occurrence which created no small amount of excitement took place in South Shields. In No. 84, Wilson Street, a woman, named Elizabeth Scorer, and her two children\u2014 a son and a daughter \u2014 re sided, and for some days the whole three of the family had been suffering from the dire smallpox epidemic, which was then feo pre valent in South Shields. The mother and the boy, aged six years, occupied a bed in the front room of the house, and the girl, aged about four years, along with a young woman named Mary Whitfield, who was officiating as nurse, occupied the back room. It was noticed the mother was exhibiting signs of a malignant attack, and it was deemed advisable to remove the poor woman, but the medical attendant found that she was too ill to be disturbed. Nothing unusal was observed during the night, and a little after three o'clock this morning, while the nurse Whitfield was attending to the boy, Elizabeth Scorer told her she might lie down a bit and rest herself in the back room. It seems that as soon as the nurse had left the front room Scorer had got out of bed and gone to a closet and possessed herself of a heavy boilersmith's hammer, with which she deliberately went to the bed whereon her son Charles was lying, and struck him terrific blows on the head. The nurse heard the sounds of the blows, and at once ran out in a frightened state and sought assistance, and found two policemen near at hand. The officers, on proceeding to the front room, found the poor woman walking about, and the boy lying almost dead on the bed with no less than six fearful wounds on his head, and with several of his fingers broken. The skull on the front part of the head was stove in, and the head fractured in other parts. After the first blow was inflicted, the little fellow had put up his hand to protect his head, and by so doing he received a blow on his fingers, which smashed them. The boy died a short while after the arrival of the officers. May 28. \u2014 This morning, about two o'clock, a fearful occurrence took place at North Shields. William Grandage, a \" gaffer\" of a gang of shipbuilding labourers, had a habit of getting up and walking in his sleep. His brother and his wife arrived at his house on the previous night to spend the Whitsuntide with him ; and Grandage went to an upstairs room to sleep with some lodgers. He occupied a bed by himself. At two o'clock in the morning one of the lodgers was awakened by hearing the window opened, and on looking up he saw Grandage getting out. He immediately jumped up to save him, but just missed laying hold of him, and Grandage fell on the flags below. He was taken up directly, but he died very shortly afterwards from the injuries that he had sus tained from the fall. May 29. \u2014 The mortal remains of Mr. Robert Edgar (lessee of Sadler's Wells Theatre) were consigned to their last resting-place in the Elswick Cemetery, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in the presence of a numerous gathering of friends and members of the theatrical pro-"], [179, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 143 session. The body was brought from Stockton (where he died after a short illness) by the train which reached Newcastle at 1 1*20 a.m. At the Central Station it was met by most of the members of the Tyne Dramatic Company and of Mr. Richard Younge's London Comedy Company. The pall-bearers were, Mr. George Stanley, Mr. R. Younge, Mr. J. W. Kimber, and Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun. Mrs. Edgar (Miss Marriott), and Miss Grace and Miss Adelaide Edgar were present, and witnessed the last sad rites done to one to whom they were dearly attached, and whose death was sincerely and widely lamented in the profession to which he belonged. May 29. \u2014 Thomas Salmon, Esq., Town Clerk of South Shields, died suddenly this evening. Mr. Salmon was in the vigour of life up to the preceding evening, when he alarmed his friends by falling down in a fit. Assistance was called in, and Mr. Salmon recovered at night. He was unwell the next day, but on the following morning he appeared better, and came downstairs. He afterwards went upstairs in good spirits, but on reaching the landing he began to gasp, and had to be conveyed to his room, where he expired in about an hour afterwards. Mr. Salmon was 77 years of age. He was born in South Shields, and educated in Durham Grammar School. He was articled as solicitor with Mr. Heron, of New castle, and was appointed Town Clerk of South Shields in 1850, when the Act of Incorporation was obtained. The deceased gentle man took an active interest in the affairs of the town, and was in strumental in making South Shields an independent port ; in obtaining the Tyne Pilotage Commission ; and several other bene fits for the borough. All through life he was a staunch friend of Mr. Ingham, many years member of Parliament for South Shields. Mr. Salmon was very much respected, and six years before his death received a valuable testimonial from his townsmen. He was also Clerk to the Board of Guardians, Clerk to the Burial Board, Super intendent Registrar for the Union, Vestry Clerk, and his last public appointment was that of Secretary to the Ingham Infirmary. May 30. \u2014 The interesting and important ceremony of laying the corner-stone of the South Shields Infirmary, erected as a tribute to Robert Ingham, Esq., Q.C., and ex-member of Parliament for the borough, was performed by Aid. John Williamson, J. P., in the presence of a large concourse of people. The ceremony was deprived of much of its joy, if not of its interest, by the fact that a very few minutes before the dawn of the day appointed for the great event, Mr. Thomas Salmon, town clerk of South Shields, a schoolmate and old friend of Mr. Ingham, and honorary secretary for the Infirmary Fund, suddenly and unexpectedly expired. The question of providing suitable accommodation for the many people who suffered from accident aud disease in the district of South Shields was brought prominently before the South Shields people by Mr. John Willliamson, and by his energy, munificence, and influence, the agitation was so successful that the committee were"], [180, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. 144 in such a position financially as justified them in negotiating for a suitable site, which was eventually secured, through the liberality of the Dean and Chapter of Durham, at the high end of Westoe Lane. The various public bodies, and those intending to honour them selves by joining in the procession, had to meet at the Town Hall, Market Place, and thence to march to the site of the building. At the time appointed all was in readiness, and the procession, headed by the Mayor (J. M. Moore, Esq.) and aldermen, moved from the Town Hall down King Street and up Westoe Lane. The proces sion comprised the following public bodies : \u2014 Band of the Third Durham Volunteer Artillery ; the Mayor, Aldermen, and Corpora tion ; Committee ofthe Ingham Infirmary; members of the Third Durham Artillery Volunteers, in uniform ; Ancient Order of Free masons ; members of Oddfellows and Free Gardeners' Lodges, and Band of Hope Drum and Fife Band. When the procession arrived on the ground there could not have been less than four or five thousand people present. Shortly after three o'clock the proceed ings commenced by the Rev. G. E. Sharland offering up prayer. The Mayor then stepped forward and commenced his remarks by feelingly alluding to the death of Mr. Salmon, who, he remarked, was first and foremost in every good and great work. He might say that it had been well considered as to whether they should proceed with such a work on that day, when their hearts were filled to a great extent with sorrow and regret for him who had gone before ; but considering that the scheme had the approval of him who was now deceased, they felt it to be their duty, and they believed it would be consonant with their late friend's wishes, to carry out the ceremony, His worship then formally presented to Mr. Aid. Williamson the silver trowel, at the same time wishing him life and happiness to see the building carried to a successful completion ; and when finished he trusted it would be a means for great good, and be most acceptable to the inhabitants of the dis trict in its having associated with it the name of their loved and respected friend, Mr. Ingham. Mr. Aid. Williamson stepped for ward and proceeded to h.y the foundation-stone, and having per formed the ceremony successfully amid renewed applause and cheers, pronounced the foundation-stone duly and successfully laid, the band played a selection of music, and about 300 children connected with the Sunday School Union singing a hymn. He said that when he came from the south of England to take part in that ceremony, he hoped and expected that it would be a day of unmixed enjoyment and satisfaction to the whole of the inhabitants of that town ; but while \" man proposes, God disposes ;\" and it had pleased the great Maker of all things to remove, from them one of the most beloved and valued of their citizens. But when one gallant soldier fell, others pressed forward. The work of life, however, could not be stopped because one dropped out of the ranks. He expressed his thanks to those who had presented him with the silver trowel, and would always preserve it in his household as a memento of that"], [181, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 145 auspicious event. Previous to retiring, he asked the audience to give three cheers for the institution to which Mr. Ingham's name was attached. The request was at once heartily complied with. Mr. Ingham, Q.C., said they must allow him to adopt what had already been said by the two gentlemen who had preceded him in expressing his sorrow at the loss of one of the most valued friends he had, and one who had had the welfare of the town at heart. It was only the preceding night that he received a note of invitation to attend that ceremony in the handwriting of him who, to their great grief, had departed from amongst them. The handwriting in that note was firm and steadfast in character, and he should retain it in his possession as long as he lived. Mr. Ingham then spoke of the institution, the foundation stone of which they had just laid, and of the great benefit and advantage it would be to the town, and of the improved system of nursing now adopted in these institutions, as well as of the improvements of science and intelligence in the way of saving human suffering and life. The children connected with the Sunday School Union again sang a hymn and the National Anthem , and the proceedings at the stone terminated. The company adjourned to au adjoining tent, where luncheon was served up in first-class style. Upwards of one hun- dred gentlemen sat down. The chair was occupied by the Mayor, who was supported by Mr. Ingham and Mr. Williamson. May 30. \u2014 The ceremony of laying the foundation-stone of a church in the parish of St. Philip, Newcastle, to the memory of Archbishop Longley, was performed by the Rev. Canon Boyd, in the presence of a numerous and influential assemblage. The dis- trict, of which the edifice forms the parish church, was constituted by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and endowed to the extent of \u00a3200 per annum, with an additional \u00a3100 a year so soon as the church should be completed. The parish comprises a populous dis- trict, including all the streets between Arthur's Hill and the Barrack Road, from Oyster Shell Lane westward. The site of the chui ch is opposite the west end of Snow Street, a few hundred yards apart from the already crowded streets recently formed in that neighbour- hood. The church is dedicated to St. Philip, and stands as a memento of the Rev. Dr. Longley, a prelate universally revered for his Christian virtues and piety, and who successfully occupied the sees of Ripon, Durham, York, and Canterbury. The building com- prises a nave, 88ft. by 32ft. ; choir, 35ft. by 25ft. ; and transept, 35ft. by 10ft., the latter occupying the two east bays ofthe nave. A vestry, 18ft. by 12ft., situate on the east of the transept, separated from it by a porch, which also give access to the choir, as well as the vestry and transept. An organ chamber 12ft. square stands on the north of the choir. Under the tower at the west-end, and at the north-west corner of the nave, are porches opening upon the streets bounding two sides of the church. Between the north-west porch and the tower, space is left for the extension of the church by adding a north aisle. The building will accommodate about 500 a"], [182, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. 146 persons. The proceedings of the day commenced with the celebra tion of divine service in St. Paul's Church, Elswick \u2014 the preacher being the Ven. Archdeacon Bland. A procession was then formed, and walked to the site which had been prepared for the ceremony \u2014 a sufficient space to accommodate all who might be likely to attend being enclosed. Thehymn, \" The Church's One Foundation,\" having been sung, and a prayer delivered by the Rev. Mr. Shepherd, vicar of St. Paul's, a silver trowel with which to perform the ceremony was handed to the Rev. Canon Boyd by the Ven. Arch deacon of Northumberland. \u2014 In making the presentation, the Ven. Archdeacon remarked that all present would join with him in feel ing regret at the absence of the Vicar of Newcastle through illness, as upon him would otherwise have fallen the duty of performing the office of laying the foundation-stone of the new church. He had pleasure, in the name of the committee, in offering the trowel to Canon Boyd in order that he might lay the foundation-stone of a church, in which he and his family, and those connected with them, had taken more than ordinary interest. He sincerely trusted that the blessing of God would be upon the work, aud he thought there was no more sure mode of bringing down God's blessing upon them, not merely from their prayers, but from being associated with good Christians. \u2014 The Rev. Canon Boyd having accepted the trowel, and offered a brief prayer, then proceeded to lay the foundation-stone. The ceremony was speedily concluded amidst the applause of the spectators, and the hymn, \" 0, Lord of Hosts, whose glory fills,\" was then sung during the time the contributions were being placed upon the stone by those desirous of helping on the good work. May 31. \u2014 This afternoon the ceremony of cutting the first sod upon the site for the erection of a new place of worship for the Wesleyan Methodist community at West Hartlepool was performed, in the presence of a numerous assemblage, by Mr. Robert Hutchin son, of that town. The site in question is in Cambridge Terrace, near the extreme end of Church Street, the principal thoroughfare, it having been purchased for \u00a3630 from the North-Eastern Railway Company. The building is in the Italian style of architecture. Its total estimated cost was \u00a35,000. June 1. \u2014 A public banquet was given in the Borough Hall, Stockton, to \" Joseph Dodds, Esq., M.P., the Worshipful the Mayor (Joseph Richardson, Esq., J.

Brayshay, Mr. Hind, Mr. Sanderson, Mr. G. Lockwood. After dinner, the Chairman proposed the usual loyal toasts ; and, in proposing the toast of the evening, \" The Parliamentary Committee,\" said he felt the difficulties of the task be had undertaken. No one felt more deeply than he did the im portance of the subject which had brought them together that day. They were all well aware of the interest which was caused in the\" town when it was first mooted that there was a scheme for passing over the river by means of a swing bridge. This proposition emanated from the North-Eastern Railway Company, and they were led to look upon that company as a very powerful and influ ential body. Indeed, they were told by some of their townsmen that so influential was the power of that body that in attempting to resist them they were simply wasting their money. At the same time, they were arrayed against such a power, and the Cor poration of Stockton thought that it was their imperative duty to resist the attempted aggression. An opposition was therefore organised, an opposition which, he thought, was based on most just and equitable grounds. The Corporation knew very well that the interests of the town were at stake. They could not be made to believe that a swing bridge, a large building, could be placed in the middle of the river without doing great damage to the navi gation of that channel. The objects to be gained by the promoters of the bridge were to enhance and improve the position of the iron masters. The bridge might have given them greater facilities, and they might have made larger profits. But he would ask that company to look back a few years, and they would see that large profits had already been made by the ironmasters. They all knew the names of Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, and they all respected those names. No man living had a greater respect for Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan than he had. Those gentlemen had opened out the district, and had made the district what it was. At the same time, those gentlemen had realised princely fortunes. To those gentlemen who had represented the opposition in London they were deeply indebted. To the gentlemen of the legal pro fession they were also very much indebted for the way in which they had got up the opposition. He might fairly mention their Chief Magistrate amongst the gentlemen who had aided them in their successful opposition. They were equally indebted to their hon. member, Mr. Joseph Dodds. Although precluded by the rules of the House from taking a very active part in the opposition, Mr. Dodds had done them great service. Mr. Dodds, too, was one of those important ironmasters who were deeply interested in the scheme, and the course he had taken proved his disinterestedness and love of the borough. That, he believed, was paramount to all other considerations in that gentleman's mind He thought the"], [184, "148 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. Corporation were honestly entitled to the thanks of the town for the action they had taken. With regard to the Tees Conservancy Bill, the promoters wished to obtain a preponderance of representa tives for the lower navigation. He could not tell why that bill had been brought forward. For a length of time he had had the honour of being one of the Tees Conservancy Commissioners, and they had always worked well. They had no particular interests to serve, and invariably adopted the reports of their engineer, who recommended work to be done in that part of the river which required most attention. He was at a loss to conceive the motive of the promoters of the Tees Conservancy Bill, except that there were one or two individuals in Middlesborough who thought they could gain something. What that something was he did not know, without it was a direct hostile feeling to the town of Stockton. What good could the bill be to them unless it was to shut up the town of Stockton ] He was grieved to see that some of the Middlesborough Commissioners assisted in the promotion of the bill. \u2014 The Mayor also reviewed the progress of the late contest and its successful issue, and remarked that in advocating the bridge he thought the Middlesborough people were standing in their own light. As to the Tees Conservancy Bill, it was the key to the whole question, and he rejoiced it had been lost. He hoped Stock ton would go on prospering. Stockton, he thought, had advantages over Middlesborough iu some things, and Middlesborough had advantages over Stockton in others. Nothing connected with the smaller branches of the iron trade in Middlesborough could be compared with Stockton, and probably in anything connected with blast furnaces Middlesborough had the advantage. The two towns were great centres, and he hoped they would go on prospering. June 2. \u2014 The mortal remains of Mr. Thomas Salmon, Town Clerk of South Shields, were conveyed to their last resting-place, the South Shields and Westoe Cemetery, Westoe Lane, and to show the high respect in which the deceased was held by his fellow townsmen, the funeral was made a public one. During the interval between Mr. Salmon's death, the whole of the public bodies had held meetings, and resolved to follow the remains to the place of burial ; and in compliance with a very generally expressed wish of the tradespeople, the Mayor issued notices asking those who desired to show respect to the late Town Clerk's memory to close their places of business between twelve and three o'clock. This request was almost universally complied with ; and in sundry places over the houses flags were hoisted half-mast high, and the bells of St. Hilda's Church tolled a muffled peal. Shortly after one o'clock, those who proposed following the remains of the deceased to the cemetery assembled near Mr. Salmon's residence in the Market Place, and walked in procession to the grave. The outer coffin was of polished oak, with gold mouldings, and brass handles at the sides and ends. On the lid at the top was a large brass cross, and Maltese crosses also at top and bottom. In the centre was a brass"], [185, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE events. 149 plate, having engraved on it the following \u2014 \" Thomas Salmon, born 26th May, ] 794.

June 7. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, Mr. George Tate, after a lingering illness, having completed his 66th year on the 21st May last. By his death Alnwick lost one of its most respected and active-minded inhabitants. He ever took a prominent part in all public questions effecting either the sanitary, social, or political condition of the community, and promoted with untiring energy, both by example and precept, the diffusion of intellectual attainment in his native district. For upwards of thirty years he officiated as secretary of the Mechanics' Institute of the town. Assuming office at a period when its prospects were comparatively low and gloomy, he con- tinued his exertions in its support until he saw it established on a basis of permanent prosperity. While connected with the institute, he frequently read papers and delivered lectures on scientific sub- jects applying to local and general topics, which proved of the highest public interest, more especially connected with the geology of the district, in vhieh department of study he was unrivalled for the possession of a wider range of information and greater accuracy of specific details, gathered by long and persevering per sonal expei ience and observation, than any other individual. He continued secretary to the institute until 1859, when he resigned, and was unanimously appointed an honorary member. When Alnwick adopted the Board of Health Act, Mr. Tate furnished the Commissioner, who was sent to report as to its sanitary condition, much valuable information relating to its geological conformation and the nature and position of the strata on which it stands. When the Board was constituted, he was elected one of its first members, and continued his connection with the Local Board up to the time of his death. For several years of the latter part of his life the deceased gentleman was secretary to the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, into which he carried all his activity and energy, taking a distinguished part in all its discussions, and contributing many valuable papers to its proceedings ; among which was his notice of Grave's Ash, a hill fortress in the neighbourhood of Ingram, and a striking description of the incised stones found in different parts of the county. About two years prior to his death he com pleted, in two volumes, the history of Alnwick, his native town, a labour in which he had been long engaged, and the materials for which he had been gathering for a great portion of his life. It is a work distinguished by much antiquarian readiDg and research, and forms a valuable contribution to the History of Northumberland. On its completion, Mr. Tate was invited to a public dinner in the"], [186, "150 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871 Town Hall, presided over by Dr. J. C. Bruce, historian of the Roman Wall, when Mr. Tate was presented with an illuminated address, a purse of gold, and a piece of silver plate, by his friends and admirers. June 8. \u2014 This morning, the opening of a new Baptist Chapel, in Grange Road, Darlington, took place. The building is in the classic style, and, being built of stone, is an addition to the public build ings of the town. It cost \u00a34,150, most of which was raised by sub scription. June 18. \u2014 An extensive fire of Esparto grass took place at Tyne Dock, which resulted in the total destruction of a large warehouse situated on the west side ofthe dock. The night watchman appointed to watch that portion of the dock where immense quantities of the grass are warehoused and stored, noticed smoke issuing from the centre warehouse, in which lay several hundred tons of Esparto. Ascertaining that the grass was on fire, he immediately raised an alarm, and proceeded to rouse the officials and policemen of the docks, who made all haste to the scene. Very shortly after the smoke was first observed, the entire building measuring about 130 yards long and 10 yards broad at the east end, and 30 yards at the west by 20 feet high, was one mass of flame. The flames rushed high into the air, illuminating the whole of the neighbourhood. The North-Eastern Co.'s fire brigade was speedily at work, and hose was attached to the six water plugs situated round the warehouse. The dock floating fire engine was also brought to bear on the burn ing mass. Information was sent down to Shields, and by midnight the borough police fire brigade, the Jarrow Chemical Company's steam fire-engine, and the floating fire-engine manned by the Welles ley Training Ship boys, were at the dock, and rendered active ser vice. Fortunately, there was not a breath of air, and the fire was confined to the warehouse in which it originated. At half-past one the following morning the fire was evidently got under the command of the different engines, but the entire stock, and some railway trucks, along with the warehouse were completely destroyed. The damage was roughly estimated at about \u00a320,000. The grass was the property of several importers, who rented the warehouse from the North-Eastern Railway Company. The origin of the fire was sup posed to be spontaneous combustion. June 27, \u2014 The great sporting event ofthe year in the North, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Races, took place this day. Magnificent weather, a first-class programme of sport, and an enormous attend ance of visitors, combined to make the occasion one altogether out of the ordinary run of race days. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Bowes's Taraban, beating Falkland and six others. The Cup was won by Mr. Jackson's Amor, beating La Favorita and five others. June 27. \u2014 Died suddenly, at Clifton, Mr. Solomon Mease, J.P., of Cleveland House, North Shields, a gentleman who had been"], [187, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 151 intimately associated with the public life of the North for many years. Mr. Mease was a native of Stokesley, in Cleveland, and was born in 1800. He came to North Shields in early life, and was connected with trade from that time until the day of his death. He carried on business for many years in North Shields as a chemist, but he gave that branch of the trade up, and confined his attention to the manufacture of chemicals in connection with his son in his extensive factory at East Jarrow, and as a shipowner. Mr. Mease took a leading part in the Methodist movement in the North for fifty years. In North Shields he was a Town Improvement Com missioner. Subsequently he, with other leading gentlemen, was the means of the borough being incorporated. He was twice Mayor of Tynemouth, and was an alderman for a long period. He was also a River Tyne Commissioner, an office which he held at the time of his death. He likewise took part in securing the establish ment of a Custom House in North Shields, and the Local Marine Board. He was also a county and borough magistrate. Mr. Mease was a gentleman of immense energy and unflagging industry, and though well advanced in years he died in harness. Mr. Mease was married to a sister of Mr. John Dryden, the well-known shipowner and banker. They had a large family, but Mr. and Mrs. Mease outlived them all but three \u2014 Mr. George Mease, chemical manu facturer ; Mrs. Toyne, wife of the Rev. T. F. Toyne, of Bristol ; and Mrs. Lomas, wife of Mr. Lomas, chemical manufacturer, of Bristol. Mrs. Mease was with Mr. Mease at the time of his death, which was caused by a throat affection, and was quite unexpected. June 27. \u2014 The foundation stone of the Spoor Memorial Chapel and School, at Whickham, near Gateshead, was laid this afternoon, by Mr. William B. Leighton, in the presence of a numerous gathering. Mr. Stephen Spoor, under .whose superintendence the work was carried out, deposited the bottle containing various docu ments in the place prepared for it. \u2014 The Rev. T. Greenfield then, on behalf of the trustees, presented Mr. W. B. Leighton with a handsome silver trowel, bearing an inscription suitable to the occasion. In doing so, the rev. gentleman remarked that he had much pleasure in discharging this duty, on account of their long personal acquaintance and the happy circumstances that brought them together when he (Mr. Leighton) sought him as a poor wan dering sheep one Sabbath day, and gathered him into the fold of the Primitive Methodist Sunday School, Ballast Hills, Newcastle. It was indeed a happy day to him, for it was the turning point in his history. \u2014 Mr. Leighton said the chief motive for consenting to be present on that occasion was his enduring respect for the memory of departed worth. The chapel was to be erected in memory of one of England's real worthies, one who lived not for himself but for others. They all knew that Joseph Spoor, of the village in which they were assembled, first went out from that place as a local preacher, and afterwards as an itinerant. Perhaps no man at the time was more useful, and it might truly be said of"], [188, "152 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. him that \" he rests from his labours, and his works do follow him.' After some further remarks Mr. Leighton laid the stone. \u2014 A col lection, amounting to \u00a337 10s. 3d., was taken at the stone, and shortly afterwards the company adjourned to a large marquee for tea, and the proceedings closed with a bazaar and public meeting. juty 3._A beautiful gold chronometer watch, in a solid mahogany case, was received at the office of the Consul of the German Confederation, West Hartlepool\u2014 Mr. Otto Freelmann\u2014 for presentation to Capt. G. H. Nash, of the Navigation Company's screw steamer Gipsy Queen, together with \u00a35 for James Bailey (the mate), and \u00a312 for four of the crew, as a testimonial from the Emperor William for their brave and humane rescue of the crew of the disabled German steamer Minos, in the German Ocean, on the 23rd December, 1870. The chronometer is of the most massive and valuable character, and bears upon the back of the case the Germanic Imperial crown and monogram. July 8.\u2014 The will of the Right Hon. John R. Davison, Q.C., P.C., M.P., her Majesty's Advocate-General, was proved in London under \u00a370,000 personalty. He was also possessed of largefreehold estates in Durham, Middlesex, and Kent, and the disposal of property under the will of his wife's father, Nicholas Wood, Esq. The testator died suddenly on April 15 last, aged 45, at the Auberies, Sudbury, Suffolk, having executed his will May 1 0, 1870. The executors were Francis Greenwell, of Durham, and Miss Maria Forster Wood, of Hetton Hall, Durham ; they were also appointed guardians of his infant children. He bequeathed to each of his executors a legacy of \u00a3100 ; to his clerk, Edward Cox, \u00a3200; to each of his daughters, \u00a320,000; to his son John Robert Davison, \u00a325,000. His residence and land at Under-River, which was valued at \u00a335,000 he left to his son Arthur Pearson Davison, together with the ultimate residue of his personal estate. July 11. \u2014 An inquest was held this morning at the house of Mr. George Richardson, the Seven Stars Inn, Claypath, Durham, on the body of a young woman named Lakin, who committed suicide by drowning herself in the river Wear, a little before midnight on the Sunday previous. \u2014 Mrs. Richardson, her mistress, deposed to'ask ing deceased to come into the house, when she stated that she did not intend to do so at all that night. Witness had previously given her notice to leave on the following morning, the reason being because she went out so often. \u2014 A young man named William Har greaves had known deceased for about a month, but did not know her surname. On the 2nd inst., she asked him to marry her,*_but he told her he could not as he had no place to take her to. He said, however, that he might marry her at some future time. She said she would buy the ring if he had no money. Was in the yard of her master's house with her until twenty minutes past eleven o'clock on the night of the occurrence, and tried to induce her to go into the house, and also asked her mistress to persuade her to"], [189, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 153 into the house, but she refused. \u2014 A constable detailed the facts of the suicide, and stated his opinion was that instead of trying to get towards him, or to keep her head above water, as she might have done, deceased appeared to hold her head under water. Witness was sure no one was near her when she got into the water. A letter found upon her was from friends in Sunderland, offering her shelter for a few days, but advising her to remain at her situation. The jury consequently returned an open verdict. July 12. \u2014 This afternoon, the Tyne four oared crew, consisting of James Percy, Robert Chambers, Harry Kelley, James Renforth, and John Bright (spare man), took their departure from Newcastle, to row a match on the Kennebecassis River, near St. John, N.B., against a celebrated four of St. John, called the Paris Crew. There was a large attendance ofthe friends and well-wishers at the station, to see the crew off. July 20. \u2014 The valuable and extensive collieries of Burradon and Coxlodge were offered for public competition in the Queen's Head Hotel, Newcastle, and succeeded in bringing together a very large number of the most prominent and wealthy coalowners of the dis- trict. Mr. Brough, who acted as Auctioneer, explained that lot 1 consisted of the well-known Burradon Colliery \u2014 situated in the parish of Earsdon, and at a distance of about seven miles from New- castle \u2014 and also included the Weetslade and Annitsford royalties, together with the cottages, 175 in number, erections, machinery, plant, and other effects belonging to the property. The combined area of the royalties was said to be 1,209 acres, and a first-class steam coal was hewn from the seams beneath. The bidding, which was started by the auctioneer at \u00a320,000, was very slow, the first advance of \u00a3500 being given by Mr. Frederick Peake, solicitor, of London. Mr. Richardson shortly afterwards offered \u00a3500 more, and the two gentlemen then made alternate advances of a similar amount until \u00a325,000 had been reached. A moment before the glass had been run down, however, Mr. Peake made another offer of \u00a325,500, and the bidding eventually closed at that sum. The reserve bid was then stated to be \u00a340,000, and hence the property did not change hands. Lot 2 consisted of Coxlodge Colliery, about two miles from Newcastle, together with the royalties of Fawdon, Dinnington, and Marley Hill \u2014 in all covering an area of 4,098 acres. The lot also comprised 235 houses, large firebrick works, two good farms, as well as other erections, machinery, plant, and stock belong- ing thereto. The bidding commenced as \u00a330,000, and was continued for some time by Mr. Peake and Mr. Nathaniel Grace Lambert, M.P., Bucks. There was no response to the latter gentleman's offer of \u00a335,500, and the bidding consequently ceased. In this case also no sale was effected, as the reserve bid was \u00a360,000. July 20. \u2014 This morning, the inhabitants of Bishop Auckland were greatly excited by the intelligence that Mr. Matthew Ewart, manager of Messrs. Backhouse and Co.'s branch bank at Stanhope, and who T"], [190, "154 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. also held a high position in the Bishop Auckland branch, had com mitted suicide by hanging himself, at his residence in Newgate Street, Bishop Auckland. Mr. Ewart was very highly respected, and the news of his tragic end was received with surprise and general regret. Deceased had for some time been unwell, but had continued to attend to business, and nothing can be conjectured to account for the rash act. It appeared that he had retired to rest, at a seasonable hour, and nothing unusual had been noticed in his demeanour. The housekeeper called him as usual to breakfast, but as he did not make his appearance in reasonable time she entered his room, to find to her horror her master hanging suspended by the neck by a large silk handkerchief, from the cornice of the Tudor bedstead in which he usually slept. Doctors were at once called in, with several friends, but life was quite extinct when the body was discovered. The verdict of the jury was temporary insanity. July 29. \u2014 In the Miners' Room, at Allenheads, a beautifully engrossed address, which was executed at Newcastle, and signed by a deputation on behalf of 1,621 subscribers, together with a massive silver tankard, a pair of elegant and chaste silver dessert stands, each of which was supported by three silver female figures in drapery, and a handsome writing case, of the aggregate value of 200 guineas, were presented to Mr. Thos. Sopwith, M.A., F.R.S., on his retirement from the chief agency of the W. B. Lead Mines of Weardale and Allandale, by the workmen and agents, as a testi monial of their respect and esteem for his skill and integrity in the discharge of his duties during a period of twenty-six years, and also to mark the appreciation of his zealous efforts in promoting education and other benevolent objects. August 1. \u2014 The handsome building for the use of the branch of the National Provincial Banking Company, situated at the corner of Dean Street and Mosley Street, Newcastle, was opened for business this day. August 7. \u2014 His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, arrived in Newcastle, on a visit to the celebrated ship- building yard of Charles Mitchell and Co., of Walker. His attention, while in this country, had been principally directed to the inspection of our largest shipbuilding yards and manufactories, and hence, with this object in view, he was engaged during the greater part of the day in carefully examining the arrangements at the Cylops steel works, at Sheffield, as well as in witnessing the various processes required in the manufacture of armour plates for vessels of war. His Imperial Highness arrived in Newcastle from the latter town by the train reaching the Central Station at 7*55, and was at once received by Mr. Mitchell and Capt. H. F. Swan, of the 8th Northumberland Rifles. The distinguished party were at once conducted to a number of carriages in waiting beneath the portico, and driven without delay to Mr. Mitchell's magnificent residence at Jesmond Towers, where they were afterwards joined"], [191, "A.D. 1871. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 155 at a very sumptuous repast by Mr. R. B. Sanderson, the Mayor of Newcastle ; Mr. C. S. Smith, the Russian Consul ; and a select party of the neighbouring gentry. Mr. Mitchell's connection with the Government of the Czar had been of very long standing \u2014 several of the finest vessels sailing under the Russian flag having been constructed by him \u2014 and hence His Imperial Highness's visit to Tyneside had been long contemplated. On the following day His Highness and suite were taken over the extensive shipbuilding premises of Mr. Mitchell at Walker, and were highly delighted with what they saw. August 11. \u2014 The remains of Captain and Adjutant Craufurd, of the 2nd Durham Volunteer Artillery, were interred with military honours in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Old Seaham. During the afternoon, tradespeople and others in the town closed their places of business ou the occasion, testifying to the esteem and affection in which deceased was held in the place. The members of the corps mustered at Marlborough Street, under the command of Major Mann and officers of the regiment, headed by the fine band playing the \" Dead March,\" and commenced the procession to the burying-ground. The body was mounted on a gun carriage drawn by six powerful horses, Captains Smith, Dakers, Lindsay Elliott, T. C. and A. G. McKenzie officiated as pall-bearers. The other officers who were present included Captains Emmerson and Candlish, Lieutenants Forster, Hardy, Thompson, Sheraton, Quartermaster Waister, Brigade Sergeant-Major Campbell, and Drs. Beattie and Gibbon. Lieutenant-Colonel Ferguson, Captain and Adjutant Roberts, and other officers of the Third Durham (Sunder land) Rifle Volunteers, in uniform, were also in attendance. August 12. \u2014 The record of the weather, kept at the Literary and Philosophical Society's Hall, Newcastle, showed that the week ending this day had exceeded in temperatui e the average of corres ponding weeks for many years. Taking the second week of August in each of the four years, 1868, 1869, 1870, and 1871, the maximum was respectively 71, 64, 72, and 80. The minimum was 55, 45, 53, and 54. The mean maximum for the week ending this day had been 78, that ofthe corresponding week in 1870 was 70. The mean minimum for the week in 1870 was 54, this week 59. In neither week did rain fall. In the previous year N.E. winds pre vailed ; and during the present week S.E. It was many years since the avaragefor a week in August had been so high as during this week. August 12. \u2014 This evening, a fire was observed in the saw mill of the North-Eastern Railway Company, situate in Coulthard's Yard, East Street, Gateshead, and soon after its discovery it burst out into a great blaze that was seen over the whole of the towns of Newcastle and Gateshead. Mr. Lawson, innkeeper, East Street, was the first to find out the fire, at which time it wascompara tively limited in extent; but as the building was all composed of wood, and had become dry by the hot weather, it spread very"], [192, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. 156 rapidly. No time was lost in communicating with the police offi- cials, and so expeditious were the members of the fire brigade that by eleven o'clock they were on the spot with a large staff of men and the hose and jets of the borough. It was seen from the very outset that it was utterly impossible to save the saw mill itself, owing to the extensive hold which the fire had obtained by this time, and the exertions of the brigade were therefore directed to the attempt to prevent it spreading to other works. Messrs. Black and Hawthorn's engine works are situated on the south and west side of the saw mill, and at one time were in great danger of being burnt also. There was an excellent supply of water, and an un- ceasing stream was poured on to the burning erection at points communicating with other buildings. After the fire had burnt for a very short time, the covering which was built over the machinery fell with a crash, succeeded by the spontaneous outburst of a huge sheet of flame, which lit up the entire firmament, and cast a lurid glare over the whole neighbourhood. The hose of Messrs. Black and Hawthorn's works was attached to a plug, and greatly aided the policeman, who never slackened their efforts to secure the object with which they started, namely the disconnection of the burning premises from the engine works on either side. The hose and reel from the Manors Station Newcastle, with four of the brigade of that town, made their appearance on the scene without loss of time, and were of great service, as were also the hose and jets of Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay, and Sons, and the North-Eastern Railway Com- pany, all of which got attached to plugs, by which they were furnished with a good supply of water. After playing upon the burning mass for about three-quarters of an hour, the danger of the fire spreading was rendered more remote, the fire having burnt itself out in a rapid manner. Twice during the progress ofthe conflagration the gates of Messrs. Black and Hawthorn's works were in flames, and if at either of those times the firemen had in any way relaxed their efforts the whole of the large pile of building with its valuable machinery must have inevitably been consumed. As soon as the fire had burnt out the flame dropped almost as suddenly as it had sprung up, and the darkness which fell over the scene was strikingly in contrast to the brilliant glare which had but shortly before prevailed, The premises covered a considerable space of ground, in which a deal of very valuable machinery was erected, and upwards of \u00a33,000 worth of damage was done in the destruction of machinery alone. August 14. \u2014 An unfortunate accident occured at Morpeth. The annual brass band festival was held, and at least 8,000 people visited the town in connection with the entertainment. As had been usual for some years with excursion parties to Morpeth, many took a foolish pleasure in crossing the Wansbeck in large numbers from the west end of Oldgate to the High Stanners by the Suspen sion Bridge, and while on it jumping, dancing, and causing it to vibrate. The bridge had been known to be in a dangerous condition"], [193, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 157 for several years, and the Board of Health placed a notice board at each end of it, warning the public against crossing it in numbers of more than twenty at a time. The notice board, of course, was either not read or attended to, and when excursion parties were in the town, one of the servants of the Board of Health, was appointed to prevent people crowding upon the bridge. It was so on this occasion, but the efforts of the watchman were insufficient to restrain the crowd. The bridge was subsequently kept in an almost constant state of vibration during the afternoon, and the fun cul minated about six o'clock, at which time upwards of 100 persons were on the structure leaping and making it sway from side to side, when the south anchor chain, at the Oldgate end, snapped close to the iron support without any warning. The weight of the bridge was thus thrown entirely on to the support, which also snapped, and the south chain slackening, while the north remained firm, those upon the bridge were precipitated into the bed of the river, the water at that point being fortunately shallow. Plenty of assistance was at hand, and all were got out without delay, the worst cases being carried to Dr. BrumeH's surgery. August 18. \u2014 This afternoon, about four o'clock, the vicinity of Hamsterley was visited by a most violent thunderstorm, accom- panied by lightning of a terrific description, causing considerable alarm to the inhabitants. After one of the most fearful crashes of thunder, the farm house of Knavesmire, about a mile from the village of Hamsterley, occupied by Mr. Matthew Wilkinson, was observed to break out into flames, and almost immediately the in- habitants of that ancient village began to run towards the spot. On arriving there the house (an old thatched building belonging to Mr. George Maw, jun., Bishop Auckland), was completely enveloped in flames. Mrs. Wilkinson lay outside the door on the ground in an insensible state, her husband, with his head resting upon her knee, quite dead, and a child by his side struck blind with lightning. Various stories were current as to the manner in which the melan- choly occurrence took place, but the most reliable appears to be the following : \u2014 It would seem that the family were sitting in the kitchen having tea, when a terrific flash of lightning, followed by an awful peal of thunder, which seemed to rend the very earth, took place, and both Mr. and Mrs. Wilkinson ran out to the farm building close by to see if the stock was all safe, when, as they were returning, they were met in the doorway by the electric fluid. Mr. Wilkinson was killed instantaneously, while his wife and child were blinded and rendered insensible. August 23.\u2014 Great excitement and regret were experienced in Newcastle and neighbourhood, when intelligence was received by telegram from Canada, that Recforth the Champion oarsman was dead, (see July 12). We copy from the Newcastle Daily Chronicle oi this date an account of the great boat race on Canadian waters : \u2014 \" The Tyne crew won the toss for choice of sides, and took the inside"], [194, "158 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. berth. As previously agreed on, Mr. William Oldham acted as um- pire for the English crew, aud Mr. James Stackhouse filled the same office for the St. John crew. The Honourable Thomas R. Jones (stakeholder) was referee. Everything being in readiness, both crews dashed their oars into the water at the same moment, and, amidst the hushed suspense of the crowd, started on their journey, without either side having obtained the least advantage At the third stroke the Tyne crew showed three feet ahead, and as they gradually settled down to their work, and pulling in their usual grand style, at less than two hundred yards they had increased their lead to fully half a boat's length. A few strokes after, to the practised eye of any one familiar with boat-rowing there was mani- festly something wrong with Renforth. He appeared to falter and to pull out of stroke. The other members of the crew held gallantly on, and for the next two hundred yards they, notwithstanding Ren- forth's irregular rowing, maintained their lead of half alength. By the time this point was reached Renforth's condition had told its tale, he was swaying from side to side of the boat. The St. John crew were soon level, and pulling their usual short, rapid stroke with great regularity and precision, they began to forge ahead, and by the time the boats had gone half a mile the Tyne men were nearly three lengths behind. At this point Kelly called on Renforth to make au effort, and the gallant fellow rowed on with great reso- lution, but evidently in a sinking condition, till one mile and a quarter of the course had been covered. The oar then dropped from his hand ; turning to Kelly he said ' Harry, I have had some- thing,' and then fell backward into the boat. Kelly held the poor champion, while Percy and Chambers rowed the boat to Appleby's Wharf. Renforth (who was quite insensible when he was landed) was then carried from the boat on the arms of his mates, put into a conveyance, and driven a mile and a half to Claremont House, their training quarters. Here he was laid ou his own bed. Kelley took him in his arms, while Percy and I rubbed his feet. We anxiously inquired for a medical man, and mounted messengers were despatched in every direction in search of one. It was quite half an hour before one was found \u2014 the most anxious half-hour I ever passed. Before the doctor arrived, our poor friend had recovered consciousness, and the first words he uttered were, ' It is not a fit I have had \u2014 I will tell you all about it directly.' He then became cold, and almost pulseless. He could scarcely bear to be touched, and his mouth every now and then filled with froth. Kelley, Percy, William Blakey, and I did the best we could to keep up the circulation on his limbs, but all our efforts were un- availing. Dr. Johnson, of St. John, who had now arrived, made a careful examination of our patient, aud ordered him a little brandy and water, and directed that hot bottles should be put to his feet. Dr. MacLaren also shortly came to us, and, taking out his lancet, he opened a vein in eacb arm. But for a considerable time the blood would scarcely flow, and it became obvious that poor Renforth"], [195, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 159 was sinking fast. After a brief consultation, the two doctors gave us all to understand that our countryman was dying. Kelly took Renforth's head between his hands and cried bitterly. Percy, Chambers, and Bright, the remaining members of our crew, along with William Blakey, John Adams, Robert Liddell, and myself stood around the bed, and witnessed, with ill-suppressed emotion, the vigorous life of our poor friend gradually ebb away. At a quarter to nine o'clock, within two hours of the time when he had left the same house full of health and spirits, our dear comrade and England's greatest oarsman passed quietly to rest, without a struggle, and apparently without pain, in the arms of the most skilful competitor he ever had and one of his truest friends \u2014 Harry Kelley.\" An inquest was held over the body in Canada, when a verdict of \" Died from natural causes\" was returned. \u2014 The career of Renforth, though short, was an eventful one in the annals of boat rowing. He was born at the Rabbit Banks, Gateshead, in 1842. When young, he was employed as a smiths' striker at many of the manufactories on the Tyne, but after attaining his majority he enlisted as a soldier, and served in India for some time, but was ultimately bought out of the service by his father. He first com menced his public career as a swimmer, and took great delight in the natatory art. Out of three matches in which he took part, he was successful in two. His first match in boat-rowing took place in 1867, and from that time up to the time of his decease he en joyed an uninterrupted success, having become champion in less time than any previous oarsman. Deceased rowed in seventeen skiff races, winning fourteen of them. He also rowed in two canoe races, but suffered defeat in both, this style of propelling being out of his line. Out of eight pair-oared matches, he was victorious in four ; in ten four-oared matches in which he took part, was success ful in seven. He was a man of great muscular strength, and lively disposition, and his untimely end caused a gloom, not only in the circle in whioh he moved, but in the mind of the public generally.\" August 24. \u2014 A grand bazaar was opened in the Corn Exchange at Hexham, under the patronage of her Grace the Duchess of Northumberland, Lady Margaret Beaumont, Lady Florence Cust, the Honourable Mrs. Liddell, the Honourable Mrs. Coulson, and other distinguished personages, in aid of the fund for the restora- tion of this fine old Abbey Church. The bazaar was opened at twelve o'clock, by the Rev. H. Barker, in the usual formal manner. The Corn Exchange had been very tastefully decorated for the occasion with branches of yew festooned with ivy. The stalls were well covered with articles of wearing apparel, and an almost endless description of fancy goods, including many articles of great value. The Exchange was visited during the day by large crowds of people, including nearly all the elite of the town and neighbour hood ; and the amount of business done seemed to bid fair to render the whole a very decided success."], [196, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. 160 August 27. \u2014 A new Congregational church at Evenwond, near Darlington, was opened for divine worship. The Rev. S. S. Hodgson, of Sunderland, preached in the morning and evening, and the Rev. William Bowman, of Gainford, in the afternoon. The church is in the early English style, and is a substantial and neat structure, built of Dunhouse stone. There are triplet windows at each end, and double pointed windows at each side. Unlike the usual buildings of Congregationalists, there is a neat bell turret at one end, and a cross at the other. The window at the west end is coloured, and of a very beautiful design, with an open Bible in the centre, and the words, \" Thy word is truth.\" The seats are open benches with backs, and are all free. The rostrum is a platform with open rails, and small reading-desk in centre. The timbers of the roof are stained dark, and the plastering between of a French grey tint. The walls at the bottom are covered with stained deals and above is done into blocks, resembling veined freestone. Septembers. \u2014 The interment ofthe remains of Henry Christian Allhusen, who died on the 7th inst., at the age of 35 years, took place this afternoon, at the Elswick Cemetery, Elswick Road, New- castle. Upon the death ofthe respected commanding officer ofthe 1st Newcastle Artillery Volunteer Corps, it was of course under- stood that his corpse would be carried to the grave in a manner befitting his long and useful connection with the volunteer force, and in a style appropriate to his rank, the strictest conformity with military usage on such occasions being observed. The very pro- minent position Colonel Allhusen occupied as a volunteer officer \u2014 and the commanding officer too of perhaps the finest corps in the reserve forces of this country \u2014 rendered it imperative that due recognition of his distinguished career should be made even in the last sad ceremony in which his comrades and his friends could engage. It was the last token of respect they could pay, and few men ever left this world more honoured, more beloved, or more sincerely regretted than was Colonel Allhusen by the members of his corps and by the workmen of the great industrial establishment of which he was the direotor. As soon after his decease as it was becoming to do so, a brigade order was issued respecting the funeral, and in obedience to that order the men, numbering about 300 ofthe 1st Newcastle Artillery Volunteers, mustered at the Armoury, this morning, wearing undress uniform and sidearms. It was arranged that the coffin should be carried upon one of the forty-pounder Armstrong guns with which the corps had been supplied by the government, on the urgent request of the late Colonel ; and though both guns had been taken to Tynemouth for practice a few days previous, one of them had been brought back to be in readiness for the purpose just named. Shortly before the hour of noon, the members of the brigade were drawn up four deep, and they then proceeded to the house, a few hundred yards distant, and awaited the hour of departure. In the meantime, a detachment of the 1st Durham (Jarrow) Engineer"], [197, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 161 Volunteers, under Major Allison, had arrived, with the intention of taking a place in the procession. They also formed four deep, and took the next place after the 1st Newcastle Artillery. About 100 men ofthe 9th Durham (Felling) Volunteers, with band, also assembled at the armoury, being under the command of Captain Commandant Watson. In all cases the officers of the several corps marched in the rear of the regiments, and in reverse order of their rank, the juniors walking first. About the time appointed the coffin was mounted upon the gun which had been prepared to receive it. It was covered with the Union Jack, trimmed with black rosettes, and upon it were placed the deceased Colonel's sword, belt, and sabretache, besides several wreaths of immortelles. Long before the hour appointed for the funeral to leave Park House, the streets of Gateshead had become thronged with spectators ; the raiu whioh fell incessantly during the morning in no perceptible degree tending to allay the great anxiety which was manifested by the thousands upon thousands of persons assembled to witness what it was believed would be one of the most imposing military funerals that had ever taken place in either of the two towns. But besides the curious and eager onlookers, there were others who could hardly be numbered for multitude who respectfully and sorrowfully watched the procession as it passed through their midst, all feeling that in him who had passed from amongst them they had lost one whom they were accustomed to look upon as a friend, and against whom an unkind or harsh word was never spoken ; one who was never known to do an ungenerous action, and who always treated those beneath him in social station with courtesy and respect. The residents of Gateshead and Newcastle very generally closed their business premises in token of regard, and the blinds of the houses were drawn during the time of funeral. The outer coffin was of plain polished oak with brass furnishings, and engraved brass plate bearing this inscription : \u2014 \" Henry Christian Allhusen, died Septem- ber 7, 1871, aged 35.\" September 10. \u2014 The interment ofthe remains of James Renforth, (which had been brought from Canada where he died), the champion oarsman of the world, took place this afternoon, in the Cemetery, High Street, Gateshead, in the presence of a gathering estimated at from one hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand persons. The peculiarly sudden and melancholy manner iu which the cham pion came to loosen the grasp of his oar, which he did only with his life, and that while apparently in full vigour and in the enjoy ment of the most perfect health, caused far more than usual inter est to attach to all that related to the home-bringing of the body and its deposit in the place of sepulture where his fathers lay. His fellow-townsmen, and particularly those who had been more inti mately associated with him in his somewhat brief though glorious professional career, would not have been contented had not his re mains been brought to his native land and buried on Tyneside, where he was best known and respected, and where most of his D"], [198, "162 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871 aquatic successes were achieved. The corpse was accordingly placed in a coffin suitable for preserving it for at least the period of time that would have to elapse before it could reach England and the funeral take place. Provision had also been thoughtfully made for giving those relatives and friends who might have the desire an opportunity of once more looking upon the features of the departed oarsman, and a glass panel inserted in the lid of the coffin afforded the means by which that could be obtained. A handsome monument, erected by public subscription, was after wards placed over his grave. September 12. \u2014 The opening ceremony in connexion with a new Mechanics' Institute at Walker, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, was per formed by Sir George Grey, Bart., M.P. September 12. \u2014 This afternoon, an adventure of a most exciting, but happily not fatal character, occurred in connection with the trial trip of a new screw steamer Lisbon, built by Messrs. Denton, Gray, and Co., of West Hartlepool. As the vessel was intended to load in the Tyne, it was determined to engage a steam-tug to attend upon her, for the purpose of taking off, at the close of the trial run, a number of ladies and gentlemen, who had been invited to go out with her for a day's pleasure. Whilst the Lisbon was laid to for this purpose, the weather at the time causing a heavy swell, the casualty occurred. A patent side ladder was used in the disembarkation, and owing to the vessels giving a heavy lurch, the paddle case of the steam-tug was brought immediately beueath the ladder, and by a counter-lurch, on her rising with the sea, she tore it away from its fastenings, and hurled it into the sea, at a moment that three persons were in the act of passing down, viz., Mr. J. P. Denton, jun., who managed to grasp the steamer's side and scramble on to her deck, and Mr. W. H. Wise, jun., and the foreman rigger (Mr. Porter), who, less fortunate, were thrown into the sea between the two vessels. Their position, naturally, was one of the greatest peril, but thanks to the activity and skill of the crews, they were both safely got on board of the tug, after several minutes immersion, in an exhausted state. September 15. \u2014 An accident of a somewhat serious nature occur red this afternoon, on the Wansbeck Valley Railway, about half a mile from the Morpeth terminus. For that distance from the station trains of the North British system (of which the Wansbeck Valley is a part) run over the Blyth and Tyne Railway. It is the invariable practice in leaving the station to back the carriages before the engine till past the point where the Wansbeck Valley and Blyth and Tyne lines meet, so that the engine may be in front of the train when the motion is reversed for the run up the latter line. This was done with the train timed to leave Morpeth at 1*30 p.m. About a quarter of a mile from the station the summit of an incline is reached, and at this point three of the carriages and one van sud denly left the rest of the train, and rushing down the incline, dashed"], [199, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 163 into the engine of a goods train, which was standing below the junction ready to follow the passenger train up the Wansbeck Valley. It was believed that the coupling chain of the van had been shaken out with the shunting of the train. The force of the collision was so great that the carriages were very much damaged, most of the seats in several of the compartments being more or less broken. The passengers having got out, it was found that six of them were most severely injured, amongst whom were Dr. Heath, of Newcastle, and Dr. Brumell, of Morpeth. Without delay, the injured passengers were all taken back to the station, and their injuries attended to. September 15. \u2014 Between one and two o'clock this morning, afire broke out at Messrs. Tweddle and Summer's blacking factory at the outskirts of Hartlepool, near to the premises of the Hartlepool Ropery Company (Limited), and Messrs. Trechmann and Co.'s extensive cement works. An ample supply of water was easy of access, but owing to the combustible character of the property upon the premises, no effort that could be used was successful in stopping the progress of the devouring element, which soon left nothing but the outer walls standing, and reduced the valuable machinery within to a heap of rubbish. September 18. \u2014 This afternoon, a finely modelled screw steamer of 650 tons was launched from the Jarrow yard of Messrs. C. M. Palmer and Co. (Limited), for the King of Burmah, and the fact that this was the first sea-going steamer that had been built for an Asiatic potentate rendered the ceremony more than ordinarily at tractive and interesting. The vessel measures 215 feet long by 26 feet in breath and 17 feet in depth. Her engines are 120 horse power nominal, are on the compound surface condensing principle, and are fitted with every appliance to secure a high rate of speed with economy of fuel. The ceremony of naming the steamer was very gracefully performed by Mrs. C. L. Brown, wife of Captain Brown, who was in the service of the King of Burmah, and had been superintending the erection of the vessel. Mrs. Brown, when everything was in readiness, performed the ceremony of christening in the customary form, naming the vessel in the Burmese language the \" good ship\" \u2014 \" Teekayeen Byan\" \u2014 and wished her God-speed. The launch was a complete success, and the appearance of the steamer after she settled down in the water was much admired. September 19. \u2014 This morning the marriage of Mr. Henry Clayton Manisty, youngest son of the Rev. James Manisty, M.A., rector of Easington, Durham, to Miss Charlotte Ellen Fenwick, eldest daugh ter of Mr. H. W. Fenwick, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, was solemnized at St. Peter's Church. The bridal party, from St. James', arrived at the church shortly before eleven. The bride, who was attired in white corded silk, with wreath of orange blossom and white tulle veil, was attended by the following bridesmaids : \u2014 Miss Julia Fen wick, Miss Helena Fenwick, and Miss Ada Fenwick, sisters of the"], [200, "164 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. bride ; Miss Manisty, sister of the bridegroom ; Miss May Fenwick and Miss Annie Fenwick, cousins of the bride ; and Miss Colling wood and Miss Hemsworth, who wore dresses of white muslin over maize batiste, looped up with poppies and corn, and wreaths of the same, with veils. The bridegroom was accompanied by his best man, Mr. Edward Hutchinson, and Mr. Henry Collingwood Fenwick, Mr. John Atkinson, Mr. Charles E. Riddell, Mr. C. H. Woods, Rev. Charles Eade, Mr. Edward A. Simpson, and Mr. Arthur Woods. The bride was given away by her brother, Mr. H. C. Fenwick. The ceremony, which was choral, was performed by the Rev. John Bigge, vicar of Stamfordham, Northumberland, assisted by the Rev. C. A. Raines, M.A., vicar of St. Peter's. After the ceremony the bridal party returned to St. James', where they partook of breakfast. The happy couple left for the English lakes amidst a shower of slippers. September 20. \u2014 The Rev. Wm. Walter, pastor of Bewick Street Baptist Chapel, Newcastle, was entertained to a farewell tea in the lecture hall, beneath the chapel, on his leaving for another sphere of labour at Birmingham, and the opportunity was also taken by the congregation and their friends to present him with a silver tea and coffee service, as well as a neatly bound copy of Chambers's \" Encyclop\u00e6dia,\" in appreciation of his unwearied services, and also mark their estimation of his character. September 22. \u2014 The spacious auditorium of the Tyne Theatre was crowded this evening from footlights to ceiling by a most en thusiastic audience, every seat in the house being occupied. Mr. Sims Reeves, the great centre of attraction, appeared along with Miss Cole in the last act of \" Lucia de Lammermoor,\" and played the part of Tom Tug in \" The Waterman.\" The distinguished tenor met with a perfect ovation on his appearing on the stage. The songs which he rendered in the part of \" The Waterman,\" including \" The Jolly Young Waterman,\" \" Farewell, my trim-built Wherry,'' and the \" Bay o' Biscay,\" were never given with better effect, and they were greeted with rapturous applause by the audience. Miss Cole also met with a very warm reception, and was re-called after singing her part in \" Lucia\" along with Mr. Reeves. September 29 \u2014 The remains of the Rev. Clement Moody, M.A., Vicar of Newcastle, and Master of the Hospital of St. Mary Magda lene, were interred this afternoon in St Nicholas' Cemetery, Newcastle. The body of the deceased was brought in a hearse from Riding Mill by the turnpike road, and arrived at the Vicarage, in Rye Hill, about one o'clock. The members of the family came by train to Newcastle. About half-past one, the hearse, followed by several mourning coaches and private carriages, proceeded to St. Nicholas' Church, where a special service, chiefly choral, befit ting the solemn occasion, was performed. There was a very large congregation, every part of the edifice being well filled. Amongst those present were many clergymen, the Mayor, and most of the"], [201, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 165 members of the Corporation, and a considerable number of the First Newcastle Rifle Volunteers, of which corps the deceased was chaplain. The officiating ministers were the Rev. Thos. Brutton, vicar of Tynemouth, and the Rev. Charles Jupp, one of the curates of St. Nicholas. The psalms were chanted by the choir to Morley and Felton's chant, and the anthem, \" I know that my Redeemer liveth,\" was sung with very fine and touching effect. A portion of the 15th chapter of the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, commencing at the 20th verse, was read in an impressive manner, and the ser vice in the church concluded with the 163rd hymn, which was very sweetly sung. The funeral procession, which was of a three fold character, namely \u2014 clerical, municipal, and military, was formed as soon as the congregation left the church, and proceeded along Collingwood Street, up Westgate Hill and the West Turnpike, to the cemetery, the entire route being thronged with spectators, and the tradesmen in the streets through which it passed showed their respect for the deceased by putting up the shutters of their places of business. On arriving at the cemetery, the coffin, which was of plain oak, with a brass plate on it, inscribed \" Rev. Clement Moody, M.A., vicar of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, died 23rd September, 1871, aged 60 years,\" was carried from the gates to the grave at the south-east corner of the ground. The pall used was of the guild of St. Alban. A wreath and a cross composed of flowers were laid on the top of the coffin. The mournful proceedings terminated with the hymn \" Pilgrims of the Night,\" which the deceased requested should be sung in connection with his funeral obsequies. September 29. \u2014 Mr. T. Rochester, of Whalton, died after a linger ing illness in his 70th year. About a year prior to his death, he gave away no less a sum than \u00a312,000 in gifts, varying from \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000, to various local and national charitable institutions. His benevolence was not confined to this one generous act, for he was a regular and liberal giver to the poor and all objects that had in view the well-being of the people. For some years he devoted \u00a3 100 annually to prizes for essays on various moral and religious subjects, by working men, which brought to light muchlatent talent. He was much missed, not only by his friends, but by the poor, whom his liberality annually befriended. October 2. \u2014 The ceremony of unveiling the memorial bust of the Earl of Carlisle, which the people of Morpeth placed on the fine staircase of their Town Hall, was performed in the presence of a large and influential gathering. The bust, which had been reared by public subscription, is a remarkably elegant work of art, and an excellent likeness of the worthy nobleman whom it is intended to represent. The head is chiselled out of the finest Carrara, is sup ported on a beautifully-polished marble base, and the whole rests on a neat stone bracket which is let into the wall above the first landing of the stairs. Surrounding the figure are five handsomely cut brass scrolls, which sufficiently and appropriately explain the"], [202, "166 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. nature of the memorial. They contain the inscription, in illumi nated characters \u2014 \" By the Barony of Morpeth, in remembrance of George W. F.

Prior to the commencement of the inaugural ceremony, the follow ing minute was, at a special court, ordered to be entered on the rolls of the barony : \u2014 \"The Right Hon. George Wm. Frederick, seventh Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, Baron Dacre of Gilsland, Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, Lord of the Barony, having died on the 5th day of December, 1864, uni versally beloved and respected, the suitors and inhabitants of the barony, desirous of handing down to future generations the remem brance of his talents, his goodness, and his virtues, have this day placed in the Town Hall of Morpeth his bust in marble, with all his printed speeches and works ; and, as one great object of his life was to elevate and improve his fellow*-men, a number of valu able instruments and books have been deposited in the hall, in the present custody of the Morpeth Mechanics' Institution, for the instruction of the members.\" The unveiling of the bust was a purely formal matter, aud the principal part of the proceedings in connection with the ceremony took place at a public meeting in the Corn Exchange. The platform, as well as every part of the room, was filled with people anxious to show their respect to the memory of the late Earl, and the gathering was looked upon as an entirely satisfactory one. Mr. William Woodman, the deputy steward of the barony, and one of the chief promoters of the subscription, occupied the chair on the occasion; and amongst these \"by whom he was surrounded were the Right Hon.

October 24. \u2014 The inauguration of the Newcastle College of Phy sical Science took place this afternoon in the presence of the leading nobility and gentry of the district. The scheme, was initiated a few months previous at a public meeting held in Newcastle, and as the magnificent proposals which were then made by the Dean of Durham, on the part of the University, met with general approval, the undertaking was at once attended with a peculiarly large measure of success. The most liberal contributions flowed in from all sources, and the financial prospects of the admirable in stitution were very promising. The ceremony was of a very grati fying character throughout, and the future prosperity of the college was looked upon as beyond question. The inaugural proceedings, which consisted principally of an address by the Very Rev. Dr. Lake, Dean of Durham, took place in the theatre of the Literary and Philosophical Society, under the presidency of Sir Wm. G. Armstrong, C.B., L.L.D., F.R.S.

The deceased gentleman expired at his residence, Elswick Villas, between six and seven o'clock this evening, having only recently completed his fifty-fourth year. The event was not unexpected ; for some months past Mr. Glynn had been in a declining state of health, and his medical at tendants had given up all hope of his ultimate recovery. Mr. Glynn had been long and intimately connected with the Newcastle Chronicle Newspaper, both as a member of the firm who acted as the legal adviser of the paper, and as a frequent and valued con tributor to its columns. October 26. \u2014 At an early hour this morning one of those heart rending catastrophes \u2014 an explosion \u2014 occurred at Season Pit, near Sunderland, when 28 persons lost their lives. The news soon spread to Murton and other collieries further west, whence skilful engineers and brave miners made their way to the pit ready to do or dare should their services be required for the rescue of comrades in danger and the recovery of the mutilated forms of those beyond human aid or skill. October 26.\u2014 One of the most serious fires which had occurred at West Hartlepool for a length of time, broke out this evening, be tween seven and eight o'clock, upon the premises of Messrs. Tasker's sawmills, Mainsforth Terrace, West Hartlepool. The place was left quite safe at about six p.m., and the first discovery of anything being amiss was made by a working man who was passing in that direction, and who promptly apprised the police, and the latter body lost no time in informing the superintendent of the Fire Brigate, who, with the commissioners' engine, quickly arrived on the spot. October *28. \u2014 Died, atbisresidence, Woolsington, Northumberland, this evening, at six o'clock, Matthew Bell, Esq., in his 79th year."], [205, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 169 This gentleman who, in the fulness of his days, was called to his rest, was descended from a family originally located in Newcastle. The first of his ancestors of whom we find any mention was a Matthew Bell, of Newcastle, who flourished about the beginning of the eighteenth century, and from him descended another Matthew Bell, who, in June, 1792, was united in bonds of wedlock with Sarah Frances, daughter of Charles John Brandling, Esq., of Gosforth. On the 18th of April, 1793, that lady presented him with a son and heir, who was named Matthew and whose death we now record. Eight other children issued from the union, namely Charles, Robert John, Henry, John, William, Elizabeth Jane, Dulcibella, and Frances. In IS 11, Mr. Matthew Bell, sen., died, and thus when but 18 years old the young squire was virtually launched into public life. In 1816, when but 23 years of age, he was appointed High Sheriff of Northumberland, and he discharged the duties of the office with all the splendour which might have been expected from a wealthy young man in his position. The same eventful year saw him a married man. The object of his choice was Elizabeth Anne, only child and heiress of Henry Gtrick Reay, Esq., of Hunwick Hall, county of Durham. On the 10th October, 1816, the marriage was celebrated at St. George's, Hanover Square, London, and the \" happy couple\" immediately started for the North to spend their \" honeymoon\" at Woolsington. They passed through Newcastle two days afterwards, when all the church bells were rung merrily in their honour, and the crowd which had assembled unyoked the horses from their travelling carriage and drew them some distance on their way to Mr. Bell's country seat. Mr. Matthew Bell and his relatives, the Brandlings, were amongst those who believed in the desirability of maintaining a martial spirit amongst the middle classes, and they applied themselves with praiseworthy zeal to raise a regiment of yeomanry cavalry in this district. Mr. Bell was unceasing iu his labour of beating up volunteers for the projected regiment among the young farmers of South Northumberland, and it is upon record that he was materially assisted in the work by his young wife. The pair would ride upon recruiting expeditions from farm to farm ; and often when the gentleman had appealed in vain to the patriotic feelings of the sturdy yeoman, the silver tones of the lady would gain the day, and an accession to the troop would be secured. Finally, the corps was called together by virtue of an order from the Horse Guards, dated November 30th, 1819. John Brandling, Esq., was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, and Mr. Matthew Bell received the commission of captain of the Woolsington troop. After due preparation, the Northumberland and Newcastle Yeo manry Cavalry assembled on the Town Moor on the 20th March, 1820, in the presence of Sir Andrew Barnard, by whom they were inspected, and their appearance commended. On the 24th March the regimental colours were presented by Mrs. Brandling, Mrs. Matthew Bell, and Mrs. Brown, and a few days afterwards the corps v"], [206, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871 170 concluded its first period of permanent duty, when it was reviewed by Sir A. Barnard. In 1823 Mr. Bell had his first taste of real duty with the regiment of which he was so proud. That turbulent body, the keelmen of the Tyne, had managed to get embroiled in a dispute with their employers, and breaking out into riotous behaviour, the Yeomanry were called out to aid the civil power in the coercion of the rebellious workers on the river. This duty they performed creditably, and then retired into the privacy they adorned so well. In 1826, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles John Brandling died, and Captain Matthew Bell was at once called to take the command of the regiment. The last \" active service'' performed by the corps was in April or May, 1831, upon the occasion of the protracted pitmen's strike in Northumberland and Durham. Lieutenant-Colonel Bell's regiment was called out to aid the constabulary forces in preserving the peace of the county, and were posted in detachments at Wallsend and the colliery vil lages in the neighbourhood. This memorable campaign lasted thirty-one days, and after that period of service the troopers were relieved by regular cavalry, and returned to their home3, bearing with them the thanks of tho Lord-Lieutenant and the magistrates. The first occasion of his stepping into the troubled arena of party strife was in 1826. The couuty of Northumberland at that time returned but two members \u2014 Mr. T. W. Beaumont and Mr. Charles John Brandling \u2014 and on the 1st of February in the above year, the latter expired after a few hours' illness, Mr. Brandling was maternal uncle of Mr. Bell, but it is not certain that his friends had at first any intention of nominating Mr. Bell for the vacant seat. Suddenly, however, another candidate appeared in the field, and commenced an active canvas for the votes of the electors. The still powerful family of Brandling appears to have taken um brage at what they considered the unseemly haste with which Mr. Henry Thomas Liddell (afterwards Lord Ravensworth) had sought to stand in their relative's shoes, and as soon as the interment of the late member had taken place, Mr. Bell was put in nomination, and his candidature was pushed with wonderful energy and perse verance. Both Mr. Bell and Mr. Liddell were Conservatives, and were quite of a mind upon the questions of the day ; so that the only issue raised was a personal one, and with that the electors had to deal. At one time there was a probability of the Whigs making an attempt to secure the second seat, Lord Howick issuing an address : but he quickly retired, and left the two Conservatives to struggle for the vacant seat, which was fought out with great determination. All the ancient paraphernalia for can vassing the county were worked with a vigour and contempt for cost which pointed to the personal matter at issue in the contest. The nomination took place at Alnwick, on Tuesday, the 2lst of February, 1826, in the presence of an immense multitude. Mr. Liddell was proposed by Mr. T. Clennell, and seconded by Mr. William Clark, of Benton. Sir C. Loraine proposed Mr. Matthew"], [207, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 171 Bell, and Mr. R. L. Allgood, of Nunwick, seconded the nomination. In the addresses of Mr. Bell and his friends the epithet of \" foreigner\" was freely used with reference to Mr. Liddell, the explanation whereof was that of being a dweller upon the northern border of the neighbouring county of Durham, he was a stranger in the land, and could have no earthly right to ask for the suffrages of the bold Northumbrians. Mr. Bell spoke from the hustings vigorously, but not at any great length, and made few allusions to the great ques- tions then occupying the minds of the active thinkers of the coun- try. In concluding, he said he might consider himself as having a right to come before them : \" He was born amongst them ; he had lived and spent thousands amongst them ; he was greatly interested in agriculture, and there was no one more deeply concerned in the trade of the county than he was ; and consequently the freeholders might be assured that their interests would be safe iu his keeping.\" He then thanked the freeholders for their attention, and called upon them to flock round his standard with the cry of \"Northum- berland and Bell for ever, and no Durham candidate.\" \" Let us,\" he said, \" drive the intruder back again, and return him to those freeholders who are best able to estimate his value.\" There was loud cheering at the close of the address, and the remainder of the time spent on the hustings was occupied by a fierce squabble be- tween Mr. W. Brandling, Mr. Beaumont, Mr. Liddell, and other gentlemen, with respect to the means by which pledges had been got and broken, and other lively subjects of contention. The show of hands was declared to be in favour of Mr. Liddell, and a poll was of course demanded for Mr. Bell. The voting commenced the same day, and at night Mr. Bell was left with a majority of 31. For thirteen days the polling booths were kept open for the recep- tion of votes, and the excitement and rivalry existing during that period can be only faintly conceived. On the second day Mr. Bell was but 2 votes ahead of Mr. Liddell ; on the third he was 48 in advance ; on the fourth, 11 ; but on the fifth he was 4 behind his opponent. He again crept up, and at the close of the thirteen days' struggle the numbers stood thus : Bell, 1,176 ; Liddell, 1,163. Mr. Bell thus gained the seat by thirteen votes. At the declaration of the poll there was some speechifying. Mr. Bell shook hands with Mr. Liddell, expressed the esteem he felt for him, and declared that if he should ever offer himself for the representation of Durham he would support him to the utmost extent of his ability. Mr. Bell further asserted that in the House he would be an \" independent member and no party man.\" The town of Newcastle gave a great reception to the successful candidate on his return from Alnwick. His carriage was drawn through the streets as soon as he had en tered the borough, aud there was much enthusiasm manifested. It was Mr. Bell's lot to be initiated into political life after the roughest and most costly fashion, for scarcely had the uproar and contention incident upon his victory over Mr. Liddell subsided ere there was a dissolution of Parliament, and he had once more to seek the"], [208, "172 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. suffages of the electors. Severe as his first struggle had been, it sunk into comparative insignificance when contrasted with the strife into the midst of which he now plunged. Mr. Henry Thomas Liddell as an independent Conservative, and Lord Howick repre senting the Liberal cause, opposed the two sitting members \" tooth and nail,\" andfor fourmonthsthe whole of \"broad Northumberland,\" from the Tyne to the Tweed, and from the Western Cheviots to the sea, was rent by factions and thrown into a state of the utmost ex citement. The canvassing of the freeholders was conducted upon a scale never perhaps attempted before, and the hospitalities of the four rivals were dispensed with a ruinous liberality. Lucky holders ofthe franchise, not content with stray dinners and sinecure offices in the towns, went with their families, as the polling drew near, and squatted upcn thelandofthe candidate to whom they were pledged, and from thence they were draughted off as occasion required to vote at Alnwick. For years the remembrance of the contest lived with the recipients of the many good things flying about, and it was familiarly known as \" the great election.\" At first all the four candidates canvassed independently of each other, and a rumour of a coalition between Mr. Bell and Mr. Liddell was indignantly denied by the respective committees of these gentlemen. Tbe nomination took place at a county meeting held at Morpeth, on June 13, 1826, and such a scene of excitement the pretty little town perhaps never witnessed previously, nor has it since. The candidates each arrived attended by hundreds of mounted freeholders, and friends in car- rages ; and dependents on foot, banner bearers, and brass bands went to make up the processions. Mr. Bell's musicians were dressed in purple and blue suits ; Mr. Beaumont's wore a uniform of white ; Mr Liddell's colours were red and white, and upon his banners was inscribed the hopeful legend, '' Northumberland's Choice.\" The populace drew each of their would-be representatives through the towu as they arrived, and when all had taken their places at the hustings, the scene must have been a singular one. Mr. Bell was proposed by his staunch friend, Sir Charles Loraine, and seconded by Mr Chas. John Clavering. The polling commenced at Alnwick on June 20, and continued for fifteen days, ending on July 6. When the numbers were :\u2014 Liddell, 1,562 ; Bell, 1,380 ; Beaumont, 1,335. Messrs. Liddell and Bell were thus elected. October 31. \u2014 This morning, the interest ceremony of consecrating a new church elected at Stannington, and dedicated to St. Mary, was performed by the Bishop of Durham. Stannington is a plea sant rural village about ten miles north-west from Newcastle-on- Tyne, and about four miles from Morpeth, on the main north road, and the old church, on the site of which the new one was erected, was built about the year 1190, by the De Merley family, under whose barony the hamlet of Stannington was anciently held. The ancient fabric had been renewed and altered at various times, but its condition at last became so perdous that it was determined to completely rebuild it. Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart., of Blag-"], [209, "A.D. 1871.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 173 don, the lay rector, in conjunction with the trustees of the Earl of Carlisle and several other landowners, moved in the matter, and finally arrangements were made to carry out the work of rebuilding. The cost of the building was \u00a36,000, of which \u00a32,000 had been raised by subscription, the remainder of the cost being defrayed by Sir M. W. Ridley. The style in which it is built is a type of the early geometrical school, worked out in all details with great care and simplicity, and with almost an entire absence of ornament. The walls, both externally and internally, are faced with clean dressed stone, and the high pitched open timber roof is covered with double boards and felt, on which the best Westmoreland slates have been placed. The tower at the western end is eighty feet high externally, much in the form of the ancient church, but as the parapet in the present instance is pierced it has a more grace ful appearance. Internally there is an arcade round the lower part of the chancel supported on marble shafts, and the chancel itself is also shafted with marble. The chancel stalls are of oak, highly enriched with carvings, and the fronts of the desks carry large kneeling figures of angels. The pulpit is similar in char acter to the stalls, but is raised on a stone base ; and there is also an elegant carved oak lectern. All the doors are of oak, with appropriate wrought ironwork studdings, whilst the general seats throughout the nave and aisles, which are light open benches, are constructed of pitch pine. The font is circular in shape, and ele vated on a marble shaft, whilst round the exterior of the basin are carved the monogram of our Lord and the symbols of the four Evangelists. The pavement of the chancel is of encaustic tiles, and the body of the church of ordinary tiles, whilst underneath the tower several old floor crosses, found during the rebuilding, have been laid down. Some additional land has been added to the burial-ground, and a new wall has been built all round it. The proceedings attracted a large number of strangers to the village, the church being filled during the service, amongst those present being Sir M. W. Ridley, Bart., and Miss Ridley, Blagdon ; M. W. Ridley, Esq., M.P. ; Charles Wm. Orde, Esq., Nunnykirk ; Mrs. Jackson, Morpeth ; R. B. Sanderson, Esq., Mayor of Newcastle, &c, &c. After the interesting ceremony had been concluded, the whole of the clergy and the major portion of the ladies and gentle men drove to Blagdon Hall, where they were entertained by Sir M. W. Ridley. During the afternoon the whole of the workmen who had been connected in any way with the erection of the church dined at the cost of the same gentleman at the Howard Arms, Stannington. Novembers. \u2014 Sir W. A.

Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun., presided over the meeting. November 9. \u2014 The election of mayors for the various boroughs in Northumberland and Durham took place to day, with the following results : \u2014 Newcastle, Thomas L. Gregson, Esq., Mayor ; J.

November 11. \u2014 A fire of a somewhat alaiming character took place in the gun factory of Sir W. Armstrong and Co., at Elswick, this evening, and caused damage to property amounting to more than \u00a31,000. The outbreak, which was discovered a little after six o'clock, originated in one ofthe boiler sheds attached to the ordnance department, and was not long in spreading to the engine house ; but before it could get any very firm hold of this latter place the numerous hose-pipes in the yard were brought into play, and the flames were subdued. Part of the roof, however, had fallen in before this was effected, and three or four engines were considerably damaged. November 11. \u2014 The will of Dr. Mortimer, formerly head-master of the Grammar School Newcastle, was proved in the principal registry, London, under \u00a370,000 personalty, by Jane Mor timer, his relict, and his sons, the Rev. Christian Mortimer, and Messrs Alexander and George F. W. Mortimer, the joint acting executors. The willwasdated the 22nd June, and this learned divine died on 7th September last, at Hampton, in his sixty-seventh year. He left amongst his children (ten sons and four daughters), in specified portions, his shares in the London Joint-Stock Bank and City Bank. The shares in the Carron Iron Company were his wife's own property, which she retained accordingly. The rents of the Hollington estate he left to his wife for her life, as well as a life interest in the residue of his property, which, after her decease, was to revert to all his children.

November 19. \u2014 Early this morning, the workshops of Messrs. White and Sprout, joiners, &c, at Cowpen Quay, Blyth, were dis covered to be on fire, by the night watchman of the bottle works. An alarm was immediately raised, and in less than half-an-hour afterwards the flames were issuing from all parts of the buildings. The fire engine belonging to Sir M. W. Ridley, Bart., was speedily on the spot, but could not be brought to play upon the burning premises. All the timber and other inflammable materials were carried away by the large crowd which had by this time assembled. There were three or four truck loads of timber all ready manufac tured, which had been waiting for nearly a week the arrival of some trucks from the North-Eastern Railway to be conveyed to where the firm had some building contracts in the country. A good deal of the wood was much scorched by the intense heat. In less than an hour from the discovery of the fire the roof of the premises fell in, carrying with it the flooring on to the machinery, and leaving nothing but the bare walls standing. The damage was estimated at over \u00a32,000, which was partly, if not wholly, insured. Fortu nately at the time the wind was not high, and, by plenty of willing hands, the fire was confined to the workshops. So great was the heat from the fire on the opposite side of the street that the doors and window shutters were scorched, and several panes of glass broken. The workmen (about thirty-four in number) lost all their tools. November 21. \u2014 A very interesting gathering took place in the school room, Ryehill Chapel, Newcastle, on the occasion of the public recognition ofthe Rev. W. R. Skerry, who had been appointed to the pastorate rendered vacant by the resignation of the Rev. T. Harwood Pattison. An excellent tea was first partaken of by up wards of 300 persons. A very enjoyable meeting was afterwards held, under the presidency of Mr. T. Sharp, and congratulatory addresses were delivered by the Rev. Mr. Grant, Darlington ; the Rev. W. Hanson, South Shields ; the Rev. Geo. Bell, Newcastle ; and the Rev. W. S Chedburn, Berwick. Many flattering allusions were made in the course of the remarks to the value of Mr. Patti son's connection with the church, and hopes were entertained that Mr. Skerry's residence in the north might be productive of as much real good to the people. Several of the speakers referred to the new pastor's ability and energy in terms of the highest eulogy, and predicted for him a long and useful career. Iu the course of an appropriate reply, Mr. Skerry thanked all present for the ready manner in which they had come forward to welcome him to the district, and trusted he should always be found willing to help any good work for the advancement and spread of religion. November 22. \u2014 This day, one of the most exciting boat races that"], [214, "176 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. had occurred on the Tyne took place. Some little dissension had taken place between the Renforth and Winship Crews (who were together in Canada) as to their respective abilities, and immediately on their arrival in England, a challenge was sent from the Renforth four, and accepted by the other crew. The names of the respective crews, were : \u2014 Renforth Crew \u2014 Jas. Percy, John Bright, Henry Kelly, and Robert Chambers ; Winship's Crew \u2014 Jas. Taylor, Joseph H. Sadler, Robert Bagnall, and Thos. Winship. The race was for \u00a3200 aside, on a course of 4\u00a3 miles, from the High Level Bridge to Lemingtou Point. A good start was effected, when the Renforth crew went away with a slight lead for the first half mile, but after wards were passed by the other crew. Iu spite of their efforts they could not succeed in overtaking Winship's four, who landed winners by four lengths. November 23. \u2014 This morning, a very destructive stack fire occur red at Pelton, on a farm occupied by Mr. G. Bailey. About ten o'clock, as one of Mr. Bailey's daughters was going into the stack yard she observed fire at the end of a large haystack, valued at \u00a3350, which was secured under a shed. Miss Bailey immedi ately gave the alarm, and in a short time the three engines belong ing to the Messrs. Joicey and one belonging to Messrs. Murray were on the spot. The fire, however, had got such a hold of the stacks that endeavours were then principally directed to the farm buildings. The amount of damage done by the fire was upwards of \u00a31,000. November 23. \u2014 The Nonconformists and advanced Liberals of the North of England entertained Mr. Miall at a banquet given in the Town Hall, Newcastle. It was expected that from three to four hundred friends would have dined together with the member for Bradford, but between four and five hundred presented them selves. The hall was tastefully decorated with flowers and ever greens, and draped with flags, the whole of the general arrangements being very complete. The chair was taken, in the absence of Mr. Aid. Cowen, M.P., by Mr. Joseph Cowen, Jun., who was supported on the right by the guest of the evening, Edward Miall, Esq., M.P. ; Alfred Illingworth, Esq., M.P. ; J. Carvell Williams, Esq , secretary to the Liberation Society, London ; Dr. Rutherford, and W. M. Henzell ; and on the left by the Rev. H. T. Robjohns ; Rev. W. Shillito, Sunderland ; Aid. Green, North Shields ; Mr. T. Forth, North Shields ; Mr. E. S. Hills ; and Mr. Samuel Totnkins. The Chairman opened the after-dinner proceedings by intimating that he had been invited to preside in the absence of the gentleman who had previously been selected to perform the duty, but whose health was in too delicate a state to permit him to fulfil the engagement. He wished some of their more competent friends had accepted the office, but they had hesitated \u2014 not from incapa city, but probably from modesty. He could only say he had been called upon at very short notice to perform a very onerous duty ;"], [215, "A.D. 1871.1 REMARKABLE EVENTS. 177 but having taken upon himself the responsibility he would do his best. There was an old couplet which said that it was not the gift but the spirit in which it was given that on the gift conferred a merit. He might then say that it was not the deed but the spirit in which it was done that would command his imperfect services to their indulgent approbation. The first duty that they had to per form that evening was to drink the health of the reigning sovereign of these realms. It was formerly customary at gatherings of this description to pass over this toast in silence ; but recently it had been supposed necessary to supplement it with a few observations, and in asking them to drink to it on that occasion he had no desire to shrink from the newly recognised custom. There were differ ences of opinion amongst all thoughtful and independent men on abstract forms of government. There were good men found to be in favour of a monarchy, and as good men found to be in favour of a republic ; but whatever difference of opinion might be enter tained by them on the abstract question, amongst men of all parties, men of all classes and sects, there was a feeling of respect for the distinguished lady who wielded the sceptre of these realms. In a gathering like the one before him, the object of which was to ad vance the cause of religious equality, it was only fair to remember the fact that during the reign of the present sovereign great steps had been made towards securing that object. It was also only justice to say that in making those steps tbe responsible advisers of the Crown had not, on any occasion that he was aware of, met with any opposition from the Queen. She had always been willing to accede to any wish made by the people through their legal and legitimate representatives. When they contrasted her conduct in such matters with that of some previous monarchs ; when they recollected the willingness with which she gave her assent to the great measure for disestablishing and disendowing the Irish Church, and the last great act passed to secure the re organisation of the army, and compared her behaviour with that of our last king, who harrassed the operations of Lord Grey's Government by hesitating to give his assent to even the mild Reform Bill of 1832, he thought they would see good reason for honouring the toast. He therefore asked them to drink to the health of the Queen. Other toasts were given, and the toast of the evening elicited a lengthy response from the guest, who was received with marked approbation. November 25. \u2014 The highly interesting spectacle of launching a large new iron steamship, for the Northumberland Steam Shipping Co., was witnessed by a large number ofthe shareholders and their friends at Messrs. W. Pile and Co.'s iron shipbuilding yard, North Sands, Monkwearmouth. The vessel is of 3,000 tons burthen and 800 effective horse power, engined by Messrs, Clark. Her dimen sions are\u2014 length, 284ft. ; breadth, 34ft. 6in. ; and depth of hold, 25ft. 6in. ; classed 20 years at Liverpool. She is specially fitted for the Indian trade, having splendid accommodation on deck for about fifty passengers, and fitted for troops below decks. The w"], [216, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1871. 178 engine room is fixed with double-acting pipes and inlets, adapting the vessel in a special manner for passing through the Suez Canal, her arrangements for injection being double and cut out on both sides. The steamer is also water ballasted amidships. After the launch, the company adjourned to the spacious draughting depart ment of Mr. Pile's establishment, to partake of a sumptuous luncheon, prepared in honour of the occasion. Mr C. U. Laws, Prudhoe Castle, and Chairman of the Northumberland Steam Ship ping Co., presided, and Mr. G. A. Laws, Manor House, Tynemouth, manager to the Company, and Mr. R. W. Surtees, secretary to the Company, officiated as vice-chairmen upon the occasion. The company included Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart, M.P., and Lady Williamson ; the Hon. Athol Liddell and Mrs. Liddell ; Major Williamson and Mrs. Williamson ; E. T. Gourley, Esq , M.P. ; the Mayor and Mayoress of Tynemouth ; C. A. Adamson Esq., and Mrs. Adamson ; the Mayor and Mayoress of South Shields ; Edward Moore, Esq , and Mrs. Moore; C. H. Lindsay, Esq., Collector of Customs, North Shields; William Pile Esq.; C. Hunting, Esq., vice-chairman of the Company ; John Morrison, Esq. ; A. Carnegie, Esq., London ; George Clough, Esq. ; Aid. James, South Shields ; C. Hunter, Esq., North Shields, &c, -fee. December 9. \u2014 The tenautry ofthe Belsay and Allansford estates presented Sir Arthur Monck with an elegant silver epergne, on the occasion of his marriage, in testimony of their respect, and of their appreciation of his character as a landlord. December 14. \u2014 Mr. George Hudson, the \" Railway King,\" died at his residence 37, Churton Street, Belgrave Road. Mr. Hudson was born in March, 1800. He had, therefore, attained his 71st year. Few men hive passed a more eventful life. The son of a Yorkshire yeoman, with a parentage which could be traced on the Horsham estate for two centuries ; apprentice to a firm of York drapers, and by virture of the same capacity which afterwards made him the associate of peers attaining the position of a master where he had served as an apprentice ; realising a capital of which a yeoman's son had scarce heard, George Hudson made his first public appearance in York as a member of the Board of Health, in 1832. In 1835 he entered the City Council, was immediately raised to the aldermanic dignity, and in 1837 became Lord Mayor of the city whose interests he forwarded, and whose prosperity he promoted. In 1833, Mr. Hudson's name was first brought promi nently before the new world of railways. Preliminary and adjourned meetings were held in York to promote a line of railway commu nication with the city, and at these meetings Mr Hudson stood first and foremost, and astonished those around him by the boldness of his conceptions, and the amount of capital he undertook to invest. But difficulties interposed; and it was not until 1835 that he first met George Stephenson, and a railway being proposed from Leeds to Derby, and another from thence to Rugby, he saw the"], [217, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 179 hour had arrived, and that York, by uniting with the Midland Line, might obtain a railway communication with Leeds, the West Riding, and London. From this arose the York and North Midland Railway Company, on the provisional committee of which Mr Hudson was placed by virtue of the large number of shares for which he subscribed ; and fortunate was it that he was with them, for he was its indefatigable promoter. The result was that in 1837 the York and North Midland Bill was passed ; twelve directors were chosen to supersede*) the provisional committee, and Mr. Hudson assumed the position of chairman of that company. He treated personally for the purchase of the land, and so successfully that whilst the land on the Midland cost \u00a35,000 a mile, that on Mr. Hudson's line averaged only \u00a31,750. At the conclusion of his second year as Lord Mayor, new honours awaited him. A testimonial, subscribed not only by the citizens of York, but by the nobility of the county, was presented in terms of the highest commendation and approval. On the 1st of July, 1840, he saw the first locomotive on a line which, so much indebted to him, opened a steam communication between the ancient city of York and the great Metropolis. With some men it might have been that they would have felt contented with what they had achieved. Not so with Mr. Hudson. He procured a grant of \u00a3500 for the survey of a railway to Scarborough, and personally visiting the district, became confirmed in his opinion that such a line would prove most remunerative. The fact that Sir John Rennie failed to form a York and Scarborough railway from lack of capital was with Mr. Hudson almost a reason for attempting it. The next movement of Mr. Hudson was bold and beneficial to the interest he had adopted. Aware of the importance of not having the Leeds and Selby Line as a rival, and knowing that a movement was pro posed by which it would at once have competed with the York and North Midland for the Leeds and York traffic, he, with a few of his colleagues, did not hesitate to incur the responsibility of leasing the Leeds and Selby for thirty-one years, at \u00a317,000 per annum, relying upon the shareholders for whom he acted adopting the responsibility which in the emergency was undertaken, to the great benefit and security of the York and North Midland Company. Stimulated by his success, and aware, with all the world, that the great North of England Company could not complete their way to Newcastle, Mr. Hudson at once saw the advantage to the public of that great work being effected, and seized upon the idea of three or four interested companies raising the capital. In September, 1841, the representatives of six railway companies attended a meeting called by Mr. Hudson, and the scheme was developed, though no positive agreement was undertaken. In October he pressed it on the attention of his own company, and as he could not command or control the entire money market he recommended that the requisite sum of \u00a3500,000 should be raised by certain companies, leasing the new railway for ten years, and that shares"], [218, "180 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. should be divided in proportion to the rent they guaranteed. The wisdom of this proposition was felt by all. The Board of Trade granted its approval. An eastern route to Edinburgh was the railway requirement ; it was seen that the proposal of Mr. Hudson was then the only way of procuring it, and it was hailed with pleasure. Of this projected company \u2014 the Newcastle and Darling ton\u2014Mr. Hudson was elected chairman. The bill received the Royal assent on the 18th June, 1842 ; and not only did he evince his faith in the project by subscribing five times as much as any other director, but to prevent anything like delay he took upon himself a personal responsibility from which most men would have shrunk appalled, and when one ofthe minor companies declined to be a party to the six per cent, guarantee, Mr. Hudson, rather thau peril the fine project of his brain, stepped boldly forward and took the entire risk upon himself. Nor were his personal exertions less striking. Though the Dean and Chapter of Durham opposed the plan with all the force they could command, they failed before the determination of him who met them with a will as firm as their own. In the meantime,, Mr. Hudson's own peculiar line, the York and North Midland, went on and prospered. Its dividends were satis factory, and its prospects good. Not so with the North Midland Railway: its shareholders became anxious; and as the directors could not sufficiently reduce expenses, it was determined that Mr. Hudson, with six others, should endeavour to do so. Mr. Hudson reported the astounding news that the expenses might be reduced nearly one-half. A furious war arose ; reports and rejoinders were numerous ; and when, at the meeting of shareholders, with tabular and unanswerable facts, he said he was only proposing what he had done on his own line, it is no wonder that he carried his point so triumphantly that nine of the directors were recommended to re- sign, leaving Mr. Hudson and his colleagues to occupy their posts. With all this additional responsibility, he did not neglect the York and North Midland Railway, or any other project which demanded his attention. In 1843 he recommended a York and Scarbro' line to the York and North Midland, and obtained a motion in favour of its construction ; in the same year, also, he induced his co-pro- prietors to negotiate for the purchase of the Brandling Junction. No man was more keenly alive to the merits of competition than Mr. Hudson, and when he proposed a co-operation of the three lines which centred in Derby, he evinced his penetration. But many opposed him from jealously ; some from personal reasons ; others from public grounds. He showed that by amalgamation \u00a325,000 a-year would be saved in expenses, and \u00a320,000 added for extra traffic. Some notion of his energy may be formed from the fact that on three successive days, at special successive meetings, he met the proprietors of three companies, answered all their ques tions, and met all their objections. He arranged conflicting inte rests ; he soothed opposing claims ; he managed some ; he quieted others ; he carried his project through a stormy opposition, and"], [219, "A.D. 1871.J REMARKABLE events. 181 brought under one contest a capital exceeding five millions. That contest and that management were George Hudson's, who, as chair man of the united directory, was the actual chief of the Midland Railway. The first month showed an increase of \u00a32,500 alone. Determined to carry out his great work of taking the railway northward, he and Mr. George Stephenson purchased the Durham Junction Railway between them, at a cost of \u00a388,500. He then publicly developed his scheme, and that which for years had baffled the people of Newcastle was as nothing to him who acted on rail ways as a fate. Intent on his old plan of reaching Edinburgh, and a projected line between Berwick and Newcastle being a want of capital, he subscribed on his own responsibility for 2,000 shares of \u00a325 each, and then, though \u00a380,000 might have been reabsed by him personally, he gave them to the York and North Midland, re maining contented with the advantages obtained by the company, and with a nearer prospect of a railway to Edinburgh. On the 18th of June, 1844, the heart of Mr. Hudson was rejoiced at the opening of the line to Newcastle. At a splendid meeting which celebrated it, words were insufficient to speak his praises. Cor porations presented addresses, and members of Parliament used their choicest oratoiy. His \" sagacious mind\" was dilated upon ; the obligations under which they were placed to him were said to be incalculable ; and the northern portion of England regarded him with a feeling approaching devotion. In 1845 Mr. Hudson was fully occupied. The Great Northern was assailing him in the South, and Lord Howick was attacking him in the North. At this eventful moment, when the Newcastle and Darlington Company was endangered and its property jeopardised, the York and Dar lington Railway came into the market. The stock was to be pur chased at the price of \u00a3250 for every \u00a3100 stock. It was a hard and oppressive bargain. It was felt by Mr. Hudson to be so ; but George Stephenson told him that \" it must be done,\" and with a reluctant hand he signed the contract. In May, the Great Noith of England shares were at \u00a3200 ; a fortnight after they were at \u00a3225. Mr. Hudson knew they must rise : it was a necessity con sequent of the operation he was conducting ; but he did not buy or hold a single share, where he might have bought and gained thousands, if he had so minded. Soon after another great defensive lease was made by him of the Hull and Selby, and when the Man chester and Leeds Company endeavoured to injure that property by a rail from Leeds to Hull and the East Riding, Mr. Hudson, by the magnificent purchase of Londesborough from the Duke of Devonshire, at an immense personal cost, at once thwarted their views and gained the victory. When the purchase by him of the Whitby and Pickering line is recorded at \u00a380,000, being \u00a3,*)0,000 less than it cost the proprietary \u2014 this brief notice of his railway career, in 1845, is concluded. His influence over the York and North Midland, the Midland Counties, the Newcastle and York, the York and Scarborough, and other lines, comprising above 1,000"], [220, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1871. 182 miles of rail, was very great. When lords courted and ladies caressed the \" Railway King,\" he did not forget, however, those he had known in less prosperous days. He still remembered the friends of his youth, and he was ever ready to aid those whom he could serve. Proud of springing from the people, he rejoiced at being the architect of his own fortune. His liberality was un bounded, and the public charities of York and Yorkshire found in him a munificent benefactor. Such was the man for whom days of adversity and gloom were in store. A fierce revulsion took place in popular feeling towards him \u2014 the public believed all the accusations against him. He fell, though many yet think that he was \"' more sinned against than sinning.\" For fourteen years Mr. Hudson represented the borough of Sunderland. He was a deputy lieutenant for the county of Durham ; and he was also a magistrate for the county and city of York. Thrice he was Lord Mayor of York. The latter years of his life were passed amidst much per plexity. For twenty years he was involved in the intricacies of a Chancery suit with the North-Eastern Railway Company, who sought to forclose his Whitby estate and his interest in the Sun derland Docks in satisfaction of their claim upon him. Within a month prior to his decease, a negociation had been successfully concluded for a settlement, and Mr. Hudson was looking forward to extensive works for benefitting Whitby, and opening out the attractions and resources of his West Cliffe estate. In 1868, several of his friends in York, Newcastle, Sunderland, &c, entered into a subscription for the purpose of purchasing an annuity for his benefit. The sum of \u00a34,800 was realised, and Mr. Hudson en joyed the provision for the remainder of his life, as a mark of esteem and regard for him as a public man ; and in 1869 he was entertained at a banquet at Sunderland, \" in recognition of his past eminent and valuable services to the town and port.*' On the occasion of the visit which he then paid to the North he was the guest of Mr. Hugh Taylor, of Chipchase Castle, and during his stay he inspected and expressed great admiration of the extensive works being executed for the improvement of the river Tyne. Mr. Hudson left a widow, two sons, and a daughter. December 17. \u2014 The Prince of Wales, heir-apparent to the throne of England, recovered from a very severe illness at this time, and at the conclusion of the sermons preached in All Saints' Church, Newcastle, pathetic references were made to the subject. The vicar ofthe parish, the Rev. Walter Irvine, M.A., gave a touching account of the nation's anxiety for the restoration to health of His Royal Highness, whose life, he said, he hoped would be long spared to the country, and to his loving and beloved wife. In the evening, the curate of the same parish, the Rev. R, T. Parker, B.A., con cluded his discourse in the following words : \u2014 \" There is at this time special grounds for general thankfuhess, inasmuch as God Almighty has, in His goodness, spared the life of one for whose recovery the country has been earnestly longing and praying. One"], [221, "A.D. 1871.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 183 of the highest and best beloved in our land has been lying on a bed of sickness ; his spirit has been, as it were, fluttering between earth and heaven. But the earnest supplications of a loving and loyal nation have ascended up in his behalf before Him who holds the nation in the palms of His hands ; who taketh up the the isles as a very small thing, and they have found acceptance on His altar.\" December 18. \u2014 This evening, a fire broke out at Messrs. Grace's Paper Mill, Scotswood, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, and, though the damage done was comparatively trifling, the blaze was sufficient to throw the whole neighbourhood into a state of great terror and alarm. The Scotswood Paper Mill has been somewhat unfortunate in the matter of fires, the entire premises having been consumed by fire in the year 1847. The stock and valuable machinery were then also destroyed, the damage being estimated at upwards of \u00a38,000. 1872 (January 1). \u2014 The coming of age of Lord Ossulston, the eldest son of the Right Hon. the Earl of Tankerville. was cele brated at Chillingham Castle with all the rejoicings and festivities which such an auspicious event demanded. His lordship was born in London on the 31st of December, 1S50. The dinner to the tenantry, which was looked upon as the principal event of the majority celebration, was held in the spacious dining room of the castle, and the noble apartment on the occasion was resplendent with the glitter of polished weapons and armour, with the innu merable lamps and candelabra, and with the flowers aud pictures which decked the tables and the walls. Prominent amongst the paintings, of course, were Sir Edwin Landseer's valuable trio \u2014 re presenting the death of the wild bull ; a group of antlered deer ; and a masterly sketch of a bull, cow, and calf, from the best of the Chillingham head. The guests began to arrive shortly before five o'clock, and the entry to the castle was at that time unusually fine and attractive. The whole course along the magnificent avenue was illuminated by many hundreds of pedella lights \u2014 placed at a height of a yard from the ground, and at a distance of half a dozen yards apart \u2014 and hence the trees and all surrounding objects were plainly visible in the ruddy glow. In addition to this admirable effect, however, large numbers of similar lights were burning closely side by side upon the battlemented summits of the castle and the screen walls, and thus the outline of the old building was shown by a striking line of fire, which was kept ablaze for five or six hours, and which rendered the place visible for many miles around. The handsome decorations of the court-yard were also displayed to advantage by temporary chandeliers and Chinese lanterns, and earned many eulogiums upon the skill and taste of the designers. The guests were very graciously received in the drawing room by the Earl of Tankerville and Lord Ossulston, after which they pro ceeded to the seats allotted to them at the well-spread and hospi table board. Without attempting to detail the bill of fare, which,"], [222, "18 4 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1871. as might be expected, was choice and delicate in the extreme, it may not be out of place to mention that two barons of beef from the Chillingham wild oxen were introduced as being peculiarly appropriate to the feast, and that nearly all present made a point of testing and praising the quality of the novelty thus set before them. The Earl of Tankerville, who presided over the banquet, was supported on his right by Lord Ossulston, Archdeacon Hamil ton, Mr. M. W. Ridley, M.P., and on the left by Lord Ravens worth, Lord Algernon Percy, Mr. Askew, and Mr. Cadogan. The vice-chairs were occupied by Mr. Jacob Wilson, of Woodhorn, and Mr. William Forster, of Alnwick, and supporting these gentlemen respectively were the Hon. George Montague Bennet and the Hon. Frederick Augustus Bennet, the second and third sons of the Earl. On the removal of the cloth, the company was augmented by the presence of the Countess of Tankerville and the Ladies Clorisande and Ida Bennet, daughters of the Earl and Countess. The noble chairman, in proposing \" The Queen,\" said he felt sure he was speaking the sentiments of all present by expressing the deep sympathy they felt from day to night and from night to day in the agonising trials Her Majesty and her family had lately undergone. That touching letter, so evidently coming fresh from her own heart, had gone straight to her's and her loyal subjects. The nation had been awakened to its loyalty, but not too soon. The cowardly attacks upon the Queen, which were found in some quarters to be the fashion, had called forth the best answer that could be given to them by the spontaneous outburst of loyalty and affection. The deep and universal feelings of anxiety and alarm at the imminent death of the Prince of Wales were the best index that the heart of the country was true, and that in spite of popu larity-hunting and treason-spouting demagogues, every true English man was determined to support the dignity of the Crown and the institutions of his country. The toast was enthusiastically received. \u2014 The noble chairman then asked them to drink the next toast in all seriousness and thankfulness \u2014 that of \" The Prince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Royal family.\" It was no wonder that those who knew the Prince personally as a generous-hearted and high-spirited Englishman should thank God that such a life should have been spared, or even that the many and many who had come within the charm of his universal affability and kindness should do so ; but the sight of a whole nation absorbed in one thought and one prayer, and that prayer not granted until it was manifest that the hand of God alone could save, was truly a sight which should never be forgotten, and therefore in his opinion the nation that did forget it might easily forget itself. The alarm which prevailed at the prospect of a long regency, and the sinister designs which it would have encouraged against the peace and order of society, had happily brought home to the people a know ledge of the blessings of being \" Godly and quietly governed.\" It was an alarm not without foundation ; for it was a regency which"], [223, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 185 saw the break down of the French Monarchy \u2014 a regency to be followed by the Bloodiest revolution the world had ever witnessed \u2014 one which had been succeeded by others with but little intermission for eight years, and which seemed likely to continue as a standing curse upon that unruly people. He sincerely trusted that we in England would escape such dangers ; but if so, it would not be by the tampering of their rulers with the turbulent and the disaffected, still less by the disintegration of our best institutions, and the destruction of the Church \u2014 or by the confiscation and the weakening of the securities of property. It was not by tampering thus with the time-honoured landmarks of their ancestors that the safety of a great and ancient country like this could be assured ; nor could it be affected by the apathy of the loyal and the respectable part of the community. It must not be said of them, as was said of the French National Guard, that they were composed of the good and bad \u2014 the bad which would attack society, and the good which would not defend it. \" The health of the Earl of Tankerville\" was proposed by Mr. G. Rea, who ably supported his lordship's claims to the kindest consideration and courtesy from all his ten antry, as well as from the inhabitants of the district generally. In the course of his very flattering speech, he took occasion to explain that a full length portrait of the noble earl had just been painted by Sir Francis Grant, at the request of the tenants, and this token of their good-will, satisfaction, and esteem he now hoped his lord ship would graciously receive in their name. The portrait was instantly uncovered, and revealed such a splendid likeness of the earl as elicited hearty outbursts of approval from all by whom it could in any way be inspected. This very gratifying and successful present having been feelingly acknowledged by his lordship, the \" health of the tenantry,\" at his invitation, was drunk with every demonstration of good feeling by the other members of the company. \u2014 Mr. A. Borthwick having responded, Lord Ravens worth asked the company, in a very suitable and able speech, to drink to the \" success and happiness of Lord Ossulston,\" whose twenty -first birth-day they had so auspiciously met to celebrate. Round upon round of hearty cheering was given in response to numerous calls, and a suitable reply was afterwards made by Lord Ossulston to the many warm eulogies bestowed upon him \" The Couutessof Tanker ville,\" \" the foxhounds of the county,\" and other toasts followed, after which the company adjourned to the front lawn for the pur pose of witnessing a magnificent pyrotechnic display, and the lighting of the immense bonfires which had been placed on the adjacent hills. The rejoicings were kept up during the week by dinners at Holy Island, Craster, Wark, Wooler, and other places ; while a ball was given at Chillingham for the special gratification of the servants and their friends. January 6. \u2014 The Countess Vane presented to each of the widows of the unfortunate miners who perished in the terrible explosion at Season Colliery on the 25th of October, a beautifully-bound copy of x"], [224, "186 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1872. the Holy Scriptures, with an inscription \u2014 \" Presented by Mary Cornelia, Countess Vane, to \u25a0, Seaham Colliery, 1872.\" Sur mounting the label was the Vane Coronet, and around the margin were appropriate texts of Scripture. Eu*l Vane aud her ladyship drove from Seaham Hall to New Seaham Vicarage in the morning, and, accompanied by the Rev. W*. A. Scott, Mrs. Scott, and family, and Mr. Dakers, resident viewer, proceeded to the reading room, opposite the vicarage, where seventeen'of the widows were assem bled. On her ladyship entering the room, the scene was most affecting, as many of the poor widows were out for the first time since their bereavement. Her ladyship addressed a few words to them, stating she was glad to have that opportunity of assuring them of her symp ithy in their great affliction, and of presenting them each with a copy of God's word, from which their chief cjm fort should be looked for. She spoke with deep emotion, which was fe.t by everyone present, and after a suitable prayer delivered by the Rev. W. A. Scott, the distribution of the sacred volumes commenced. The Bibles being for use, six of the oldest widows received copies with lar^e print, specially selected for them, aDd one, who was a Roman Catholic, hai a Dou.ii version given her by the Couutess. The iuteresting yet melancholy proceedings were brought to a close by Lady Vane kindly sinking hands with each of the bereaved women, after which, accompanied by the Rev. W. A. Scott and Mrs. Scott, her ladyship proceeded to visit, at their own homes, those who had been prevented attending. Among these were two who had recently been confined, and some' others near their confinement or from affliction which had caused their unadvoidable absence. In each case the Countess presented the Bible with her own hands, accompanying the gift with many ex pressions of the kindest Christian sympathy. January 12. \u2014 The Victoria Hall, in Toward Road, Sunderland, received within its walls its first \"audience,\" aid as the noble auditorium was crowded in every part, its capabilities were tested to the uttermost, and certainly bore the test most triumphantly. The occasion was a performance of Mendelsshon's \" Elijah\" by the Sunderland Philharmonic Society, with a bind and chorus number ing nearly 200. January 19. \u2014 The Mayor of Sunderland (W. Nicholson, Esq.) and Mrs. Mayoress gave a grand ball in the large hall of the Athen\u00e6um, Fatvcett Street, Sunderland, and the gay re-uuion was numerously attended, and proved to be a mjst brilliant aid suc cessful aff iir. Tho hall was beautifu ly decorated tor the occasion with piuk a&d wliite hangings, artificial flowers, evergreens of all kinds, and splendid gilt-tramed looking-glasses placed at the top of the room, the b.ittom near the entrance door, aud at other conspic uous parts of tho building, rfomj high-class engravings were also hung, so that they could be easily discerned, between the openings of the curtain hangings. The illumination of the scene was given"], [225, "a.d. 1872. 187 REMARKALLE EVENTS. from fourteen artistically-mounted gilt gasiliers suspended round the room, and two glass-lustre chandeliers branching from the top ofthe two blue and white spirally-shaped pillars in the centre of the hall, one near the entrance door, and another suspended from beneath a pretty device of the flags of Great Britain. The entrance to the Athen\u00e6um was covered from the portico to beyond the pavement, and the pillars and beams of the lobby were profusely decorated with evergreens, from the branch of which hung a number of variously coloured lamps, and so lent an additional charm to the tastefulness of the whole design. January 24. \u2014 Major Tsmay's extensive and valuable collection of oil paintings, water-colour drawings, and engravings were brought to the hammer at Strawberry House, Newcastle-on-Tyne. There was an excellent attendance, and for some of the gems of art there was keen competition, high prices in some instances being realised. In the oil paintings, \" Cupid,\" after Corregio, was bought by Mr. Farthing for \u00a3530, that being the highest price obtained in this class. The water-cokur drawings generally sold remarkably well. With one or two exceptions the whole of the drawings in this class werebyT.M. Richardson, jun. \" Ovingham Boathouse\" was se cured by Mr. Hugh Taylor, of Chipchase Castle, for \u00a363. \" The Castle of Ischia, Italy,\" was purchased by Mr. Clayton for \u00a372 10s. ; and for \" Vico, Naples,\" Mr Charles Mitchell paid \u00a358 16s. The last-named gentleman also bought \" Urquhart Castle, Loch Ness,\" for \u00a363 ; and the next, *' Puzzuoli, Gulf of Naples,\" was sold to Mr. Farthing for \u00a3127. \" Monaco, between Genoa and Nice,\" and \" Gate Crag, Borrowdale, Cumberland,\" were knocked down to Mr. Robinson for \u00a3514 10s. Many of the specimens were disposed of by private contract. January 28 \u2014 This evening, Christ Church, West Hartlepool, was so densely crowded, on the occasion of the Rev. J. H. Martin's farewell sermon, that extra seats had to be provided in the aisles. The occasion was one of peculiar iuterest, as the rev. gentleman was about to remove to to occupy the posi tion of vicar. After having, in the course of a mest able sermon, alluded to the special circumstances of the occasion, and the regret he felt at parting with a congregation so long endeared to him, Mr. Martin reviewed at considerable length the leading features of the six years of his ministration ; and trusted that if he were spared again to come amongst his present congregation, he should see the same simplicity of worship and earnestness of devotion, the same familiar faces which he had known for years, and no root of bitter ness, no divisions ; but that the pastor and his people would strive tegether to perpetuate the faith of the gospel, and not only proclaim but exert themselves to its advancement. January 31 \u2014 A demonstration of the Liberals of Durham took place in the New Town Hall of that city, on the occasion of the presentation of a testimonial to T. C. Thompson, Esq, of Ashdown"], [226, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1872. 188 Park, Wiltshire, who unsuccessfully contested the representation of that borough in Parliament in 1871. The idea of presenting Mr. Thompson with a testimonial in recognition of his services to the Liberal cause originated at a meeting of working men, but the project, which was at first intended to take the form of a working men's testimonial, was ultimately extended so as to embrace the whole body of the Liberal electors. About \u00a3150 having been col lected in subscriptions, a handsome salver, beautifully chased, and measuring some twenty inches in diameter, was supplied to the committee, and an address was drawn up, and elegantly engrossed and illuminated. The proceedings commenced at five o'clock, the chair being occupied by John Bramwell, Esq., Recorder of Durham, who was supported by the guest of the evening, Thomas Charles Thompson, Esq., of Ashdown Park ; Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart , M.P ; James C. Stevenson, Esq., M.P., South Shields ; Rev. Thos. Rogers ; Col. C. M. Palmer, Jarrow, &c. ; and on the left by the Mayor of Durham (Mr Aid. Thos. White); John Henderson, Esq., M.P., Durham ; Edmund Backhouse, Esq., M.P., Darlington; Wm. Stobart, Esq , Cockin Hall ; George Robson, Esq., Durham; Major Hunt, Birtley; and Charles Hendeison, Esq., Durham. The vice-chairmen were Mr. Aid. J. Fowler, Mr. Aid. R. Robson, and Mr. Aid. J. Watson. January 31.\u2014 The dramatic company of the Tyne Theatre, and the ladies and gentlemen specially engaged in the performance of the pantomime, \" Sindbad the Sailor,\" with the members of the several other departments of that establishment, were entertained to a substantial supper by the lessee, Geo. Stanley, Esq. Owing to the late hour up to which the compauy were engaged, the ban quet was necessarily fixed for a very advanced hour, and midnight had sounded ere the company sat down. The supper took place on the stage of the Tyne Theatre, which, being cleared for that purpose, formed a magnificent banquetting hall, of which the green curtain formed one side, the other sides being composed of scenery admirab'y appropriate to the occasion, while flags and banners were profusely hung from above, the whole being lighted up with bril liant effect, for which the arrangements of a well-appointed stage offer such unequalled facilities. About eighty ladies and gentle men were present ou the occasion, Mr. Geo. Stanley, the lessee of the theatre, occupying the chair, and Mr. J. W. Kimber, the stage manager, the vice-chair. A very substantial supper having been energetically disposed of, and the tables having been furnished with wines, spirits, and other customary refreshments, the chair man proposed the health of Her Majesty, the Prince of Wales, and the other members of the Royal Family, which being duly honored, Mr Graham, in a brief speech, gave \" Success to the Tyne Theatre,\" coupling with the toast the name of Mr. Stanley. \u2014 The chairman, in acknowledging the toast, remarked upon the prosperity which had attended the theatre from its commencement, and of which every succeeding year had witnessed an increasing measure. He"], [227, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 189 had to thank the public for the liberal and continually-increasing support they had given to the enterprise, and especially he had to acknowledge the ability and indefatigable zeal and goodwill ex hibited by everybody engaged in every department of the theatre. When, five years previous, the theatre was in course of construction some said, \" Two theatres will never do in Newcastle ;\" others, that it would soon be \" converted into a chapel,'' and when, in spite of these gloomy predictions, the building went on to completion, it was asserted that it was not safe, because the walls were out of the perpendicular ! Well, the walls had been pretty well tested during five years, and all apprehension as to their safety had been set at rest. Nor had either of the other contingencies come to pass. The establishment of a second theatre had given rise to a healthy rivalry from which the public and the theatrical profession reaped great benefit. Both theatres had since been conducted with a spirit quite unknown previously. The list of artistes who had appeared at the Tyne Theatre was far too long for enumeration. It embraced almost every great name in the dramatic and lyric world. Miss Helen Faucit, Mrs. Scott Siddons, Mr. Byron, Mr. Boucicault, Mr. Buckstone, Mr. Sims Reeves, and a hundred others of lesser note, but great in their several walks, had trodden the stage upon which they were assembled, while Italian and French operas had been rendered there by their ablest exponents. Before he sat down, he begged to propose the health of Mr. J. W. Kimber, his stage manager, to whose business-like and methodical habits, perfect knowledge of the duties of his post, and unvarying and con siderate courtesy, they all, as well as he, could bear cheerful testimony. \u2014 The toast was very warmly received, and Mr. Kimber having responded, other toasts, of a complimentary character, were given, and the early hours of morning spent in a harmonious manner. February 2. \u2014 The formal opening of a new Training College for females, in connection with the British and Foreign School Society, took place at Darlington, two or three new villas standing consecu tively in Grange Road having been adapted at some cost for the purpose. This step had been taken after a conference of gentle* men favouring this class of schools from Newcastle, Sunderland, York, and Darlington, the distance from London to the northern counties preventing many pupil teachers from seeking admission to the college at Stockwell, in London. The college has accomoda tion for about fifty students. February 4. \u2014 The Rev. H. J. Martin, the new vicar of New castle-upon-Tyne, read himself in, before large congregations, at St. Nicholas' Church, this morning and evening. February 5. \u2014 Early this morning, a lamentable and somewhat singular accident occurred at the North Brancepeth Colliery, uear Durham, by which two poor fellows were killed. Henry Kenny, deputy master sinker, and John Dove, sinker, who had been"], [228, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 190 engaged in putting in the lower permanent set of pumps, were ascending to bank in the \"kibble,\" drawn by the \"jack\" rope. They had guided the end of a thick rope, which was being lowered by a patent winch to the cradle past some timber, and had reached an altitude of between eight and ten fathoms from the top, when, from some cause, the winch, which was manned by four hands, began to run amain, sending the thick rope into the mine with terrific velocity. The banksman, Bainbridge, and a person named Gilbspie, standing at the pit mouth, witnessed the speed with which the cradle rope was going down, and Bainbridge shouted to lift the \"kibble\" with all possible despatch, an order which was instantly obeyed. At the same moment the two men named heard Kenny shout \" Bend away !\" that is \" haul up.\" Almost directly afterwards the end of the cradle rope flew off the winch, and dis appeared within the depths of the shaft, at the same moment the kibble sustained a check which almost stopped the engine, and directly afterwards the iron vessel was drawn out of the shaft minus the two men, who but an instant before were known to be within it. It was at once surmised that the blow from the end of the rope as it flew down the shaft had either knocked the poor fellows off their perch on the kibble, or had upset the latter and precipitated them down into the \" sump,\" a distance of about eighty fathoms, and in which about seventeen fathoms of water was accumulated at the time. Mr. Thompson, the viewer, and some of his subordinates were soon in attendance at the mouth of the pit, and under their direction parties of sinkers were sent down to look for the missing men. The wreck of the cradle was found floating on the top of the \" sump,\" but nothing was to be seen of the men. The pumping engine was at once put on to full power, while grapnels were taken down the shaft to drag for the bodies. Encumbered as they were by the rope which had caused the mis chief, however, all efforts were abortive until about half-past two o'clock, when, the water having been reduced to about three fathoms, the body of the unfortunate deputy master sinker was found and brought to bank. He had sustained very severe inju ries about the head, and had evidently been killed before reaching the \" sump.\" The body of the other man was found two hours afterwards, and although it was surmised that he had fallen into the water head foremost, he had few marts about him. The two bodies were at once placed in coffins, which had been prepared for their reception, and conveyed to their respective homes at Lan^ley Moor. February 8. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Southend, Darlington, aged 72 years, Joseph Pease. The sad event, threw a gloom over the town of Darlington, and could hardly be said to be unexpected, as Mr. Pease, had exhibited symptons which led those around him to believe that his end was fast approaching. As, however, he had on one or two previous occasions rallied when his recovery appeared almost hopeless, it was thought Lot unlikely by the general public"], [229, "A.D. 1872.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 191 that his valuable life might be still further prolonged. This hope was, however, scarcely shared by his medical man. In every aspect of it the life of Mr. Pease was that of a self-made magnate, whose rise and growth were inseparable from the welfare of a vast population. He was amongst the first, aud to Che end he was the most notable, of the men who constitute the new aristocracy of England. When he was youug, social position and political power were iucidents of land-owning aud privileges of inheritance rather than of merit. He was the first of his own once persecuted sect to obtain a seat in the legislature ; but it scarcely needed this high dignity to seal his title to be considered one of the great ones of the earth. His opulence combined with his moral excellence of many kinds and his intellectual culture secured for him a place which was exalted enough to gratify the worldly ambition of any reasonable mind ; aud he departed from amongst the children of men with the testimony that he helped to make the world richer and left it better than he found it. February 12. \u2014 Died, at his residence, 12, Ellison Place, New castle-on-Tyne, Mr. Aid. John Blackwell, at the advanced age of 80 years. He was born in Sheffield, or the immediate neighbourhood, and on attaining maturity his tastes led him to become a travelling preacher in connection with the New Connexion Methodists, or '* Kilhamites,\" a name by which they were much better known at that period. While quite a young man, he was removed to differ ent circuits, and amongst others to that of Shields. It was while stationed there that he became acquainted with Miss Falconer, who afterwards became his wife. His union with that lady would seem to have diverted him from the line of life he had marked out for himself. He ceased to be a travelling preacher, for the purpose of devoting himself to commercial pursuits. On the retirement of Mr. Robert Montgomery, the poet, from the management and proprietorship of the Sheffield Iris in 1825, Mr. Blackwell suc ceeded him, and carried tnat paper on for some years. It was not, however, a very flourishing concern, and in 1832 Mr. Blackwell began to cast about for a more profitable investment of his capital. The Newcastle Gourant, established in 1711, and the first news paper published north of the Trent, was in the market, and was purchased by Messrs. John Blackwell and Co. for \u00a38,000. One of his partners in this undertaking was Mr. J. B. Falconar, father of the Sheriff of Newcastle for 187*2, Mr. Joseph Armstrong being a clerk in the office at the time of the purchase, and subsequently admitted as a junior partner. At the time Mr. Blackwell became proprietor of the Courant, that journal had been published 121 years, and had only had duriug that time the following proprietors, viz. : Mr. John White, afterwards joined in the partnership by Mr. Thos. Saint, who, on Mr. White's death in 1769, became the sole proprietor. After Mr. Saint's death, in 1788, the paper passed ito Messrs. Hall and Elliott, and by the executors of Mr, Hall was in the year 1796 sold to Mr. Edward Walker, by whose death in 1831"], [230, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1872. 192 it became the property of Mr. Cooke, and from the latter it passed into the hands of the Messrs. Blackwell and Co. The first number issued by these gentlemen was dated July 7, 1832. The Courant was the first newspaper printed on a Stanhope press, and that press, on improved principles, was made in Newcastle. In point of circu lation and as an advertising medium, the Courant, at the time to which we refer, and until the establishment of the daily press, far exceeded its weekly contemporaries. On the 24th December, 1840, was published at 89, Side, Newcastle, the first number of The Great Northern Advertiser and Commercial Herald. It was really what its name indicated \u2014 an advertising sheet. On the 30th Sep tember, 1843, it changed its title to that of the Newcastle Advertiser. The proprietors of the Courant seem to have regarded this publi cation as a dangerous competitor, for in January, 1845, they purchased the paper and carried it on for a few years, but discon tinued its publication on the 1st August, 1848. They also appear to have watched with considerable interest the growth of the daily newspaper press. When the first daily newspaper issued in New castle was brought to this town from Darlington, in 1855, they de+ermined, with a view to protect the interests of the Courant, to commence a trio-weekly paper to compete with the daily sheet. This new venture of theirs was called The Newcastle Messenger and Advertiser, and the first number was published ou the 3rd July, 1855. The Messenger, however, proved so unsuccessful that it was discontinued on the 28th March, 1857, when 273 numbers had been published, and its daily rival was left in possession of the field. Mr. Falconar, after a time, retired from his connection with the Courant, but the partnership between Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Arm strong continued up to the period of the latter gentleman's death in 1863. In the year 1866, Mr. Blackwell and Mrs. Armstrong dissolved partnership, and Mr. John Henry Rutherford purchased her half-share and joined Mr. Blackwell. Four years prior to his decease, however, Aid. Blackwell, in consequence of increasing in firmities from advanced years, withdrew from the concern alto gether, and Mr. Rutherford became sole proprietor of the Courant. Commencing life as a Dissenter, we find Mr. Blackwell, on taking up his residence in this town, after the purchase of the Courant, attending the New Connexion place of worship, Bethel Chapel, Manor Chare, a building afterwards used a corn loft. Although he had ceased to be a travelling preacher, Mr. Blackwell was still what is generally known as a \" local preacher \" When the con gregation quitted Bethel for Salem Chapel in 1836, Mr. Blackwell accompanied them. He was then, and had been for some time, a leading member. When the dispute took place amongst the mem bers of the chapel with reference to the opinions of Mr. Joseph Barker, about 1846, Mr. Blackwell defended the latter, and re mained with him when Mr. Barker got the chapel to himself. Subsequently, however, when Mr. Barker appeared to go further than Mr. Blackwell could conscientiously follow him, he quitted"], [231, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 193 the chapel, and attached himself to the Established Church, with which, up to his death, he remained connected. Mr. Blackwell's long and somewhat eventful connection with the Town Council commenced in 1839 \u2014 four years after the constitution of the re formed body. On the 16th September, in that year, Mr. Thomas Bell was elected alderman in the place of Mr. J. Spedding, de ceased. Mr. Bell's elevation to the aldermanic dignity created a vacancy in the representation of St. Andrew's North Ward ; and on the 23rd September, of that year, Mr. Blackwell was elected Mr. Bell's successor. Years passed on, and Mr. Blackwell still remained a councillor. Aldermanic vacancies occurred, but he was persistently passed over, although his claims on the ground of long service aud ability were equal to any and superior to some of those preferred to him ; and it was only by putting in motion the machinery of the law that he was allowed to take his seat amongst the upper \" fourteen.'' The story of \" How he became an alder man\" is a singular one, and was not without a comic incident. In 1850, Mr. R. P. Philipson was elected an alderman, but subse quently declined to stand. On the 20th November, of that year, a meeting of the Council was held to fill up the vacancy thus created. Mr. Joseph Hawks and Mr. Blackwell were nominated, the former receiving 31 votes, and the latter 13. Mr. Hawks was thereupon declared to be elected, but Mr. Blackwell denied his opponent's qualification to be upon the register, and asserted him self to be the legal alderman. Mr. Hawks declined to contest the point, aud retired. A special meeting of the Council was conse quently held on December 3, 1851, the notice convening it stating it to be \" for the purpose of electing an alderman in the room and place of Joseph Hawks, Esq., and for taking such steps with re ference to the vacancy in the office of alderman as the Council shall think fit.'' Some discussion took place as to whether the Council could proceed to a new election or not in the face of Mr. Hawks's alleged disqualification and Mr. Blackwell's claim. Aid (then Councillor) Ingledew, in making a personal explanation, stated his opinion that Mr. Hawks had never been properly elected to fill the office of alderman. Proceedings were then taken against him by quo warranto, and he retreated from the fight. Notice had been given on the occasion of the election, stating the facts that had since been disclosed ; yet, in spite of that notice, Mr. Hawks had the greatest number of votes on that occasion. Mr. Blackwell stood next, and his votes were good ones, while those for Mr Hawks were bad for the reasons already stated ; and he (Mr. Ingledew) was advised, as Mr. Blackwell was also, and he would maintain in that Council that Mr. Blackwell was now the alderman, and that the place was now filled up so that there was no vacancy, and, therefore, the proceedings of that day would be mere moonshine. Mr. Blackwell's conduct during the debate was characterised by calmness, self-respect, and good temper. At the close of the lengthy and somewhat acrimonious discussion, the T"], [232, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 194 Council proceeded to elect an alderman in the place of Mr. Hawks, when the voting was, for Mr. R Robinson, 25 ; for Mr. Blackwell, 4 ; declined to vote, 16. Mr. Blackwell, however, still persisted in his claim, and, supported by counsel's opinion, he attended a meeting of the Council on the 5th May, 1852. It resulted in a \" scene\" almost unique, we dare say, in the annals of Town Council proceedings. Mr. Blackwell's presence in the Council Chamber was at once noticed by the then Mayor (Aid. James Hodgson) drawing attention to the augmentation in the number of the Council occasioned by Mr. Blackwell's attendance. That gentleman, the Mayor said, had ceased to be a councillor, and another gentle- man had been elected to fill his place. Mr. Blackwell, therefore, could not be acknowledged in the capacity in which he had been accustomed to sit in that Council. He presumed that Mr. Black- well was present in support of a claim which he had made some time ago to be an alderman. The Council took that claim into consider- ation, and objected to it, and in support of their decision against his claim they had elected Mr. Robinson to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the gentleman whom Mr. Blackwell claimed to succeed. The then Town Clerk (Mr. John Clayton) said there were only fourteen aldermen, and consequently Mr. Robinson and Mr. Blackwell could not both be aldermen. The Council having elected Mr. Robinson as alderman on the assumption that the place claimed by Mr. Blackwell was vacant, it appeared to him (the Town Clerk) that if they acted consistently they must place Mr. Black- well in a position to apply to the Queen's Bench for a mandamus commanding the Council to receive his vote. He thought the ques- tion should be tried, whether Mr. Blackwell was or was not an alderman . By declining to take Mr. Blackwell's vote, they would be in a position to have it settled. Mr. Aid. Losh accordingly moved \u2014 \" That the Council act upon the advice of the Town Clerk, and that Mr. Blackwell be not allowed to act and vote as an alderman.\" Mr. Aid. Dodds seconded the motion, which was car- ried by 23 to 13 \u2014 8 members declining to vote. Mr. Blackwell tendered his vote against the motion, but the Mayor objected to receive it, and it was not recorded. Mr. Blackwell, however, did not retire. He had a doubt upon his mind as to whether or not he should retire, but as the question was not, as he regarded it, a per- sonal one, he should remain until something more was done. The Mayor then said : \" If Mr. Blackwell does not choose to retire we must call in the sergeant-at-arms and give him into custody. (Much laughter.) Ring the bell for Mr. Redhead.\" Mr. Redhead entered in obedience to the summons, and having been requested by the Mayor to remove Mr. Blackwell from the Council Chamber, he slightly touched Mr. Blackwell ou the shoulder, when that gentleman rose and said, \" Then, Mr. Mayor, I retire under com pulsion.\" Mr. Blackwell afterwards brought an action against the Mayor for assault, the damages of which were assessed at \u00a320. The dispute terminated in 1853 by the Council admitting Mr."], [233, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE ETT-NTS. 195 Blackwell to sit as alderman by virtue of his election in 1850 The course of events shows that Mr. Blackwell was ambitious to fill the mayoral chair. He did not push himself prominently for ward, but his friends took proceedings ou his behalf towards the attainment of this object. Private meetings were held and arrange ments made for promoting his success ; but the dominant party in the Council were too strong, and entertained too lively a recollection of the recent aldermanic dispute to permit the attainment of the coveted dignity. Tn 1855, the friends of Mr Blackwell made another strong effort in his behalf, but they were again doomed to disappointment and defeat, Mr. Phillipson being elected to the office. Rumours to the effect of his having taken an active part in promoting his own candidature having reached the ears of Mr. Blackwell, that gentleman (after the Mayor elect had returned thanks for the honour doue him) rose and said : \u2014 \" Perhaps the Council will indulge me for a few minutes'while I allude to a mat ter personal to myself. My name, without my consent, has been introduced before the public for two or three years as being a candi date for the office of Mayor. Last year I determined, as what I had said and done on previous occasions had been misconstrued, and occasion taken to say things with the view, as I verily believe, of annoying me and those interested in me \u2014 I determined not to open my mouth upon the subject, in any way, or in any shape whatever, to any individual. I did so last year. This year my name was introduced again. I know the motives of the individuals who have introduced it to have been of the very best kind, and they are friends whose conduct I shall never cease to appreciate and value as it deserves ; but I owe it to myself to say, that since I have been a member of this Council I have never sought this office. * * * The time has come for me to express my mind, which is, that in the future I shall consider the exertions and wishes of my friends as at an end, and all obligations as having ceased between us, and I now say most distinctly that no circumstances which I can imagine to occur will induce me to accept that office. I think it is due to myself to put an end to these imputations \u2014 it is also due to those who are interested in me, and whose feelings I have some respect for. In future, I do trust that my name will not be associated with the office, as it will not be with my consent, nor in accordance with my wishes.\" A few years, however, some times produce great and surprising changes, softening the asperities of party feeling, and reconciling the bitterest opponents. In 1859, accordingly, the long-defirred gratification of his ambition took place, and Mr. Blackwell was appointed chief magistrate. It is fair to say that he made an excellent Mayor, and that neither the dignity, honour, nor usefulness of the office suffered while he occu pied the chair. This was the only time that Mr. Blackwell filled the office of Mayor. For many years he sat as a magistrate on the borough bench, and was most painstaking in investigating the cases brought before him. Mr. Blackwell was twice married. He had"], [234, "196 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1872. a family by his first wife. After her death he married Mrs. Tul loch, widow of Mr. Benjamin Tulloch, surgeon, of this town, who survived him. February 13. \u2014 The remains of Mr. Joseph Pease, of Southend, Darlington, were interred in the graveyard attached to the Friends' Meeting House, in that town, amid such a scene of popular respect and sorrow as is not frequently witnessed. The business places of Darlington were entirely closed, many factories in the district sus- pended operations, and the bells of St. Cuthbert's, St. John's, and Trinity Churches clanged out their mournful invitations to the ceremony so speedily to be enacted. As if in response to these muffled peals, and, despite the thick and murky character of the atmosphere, the reads to Southend soon began to throng with decently-clad people. Great numbers of these, as a matter of course, took up their stands on the palisadings which surround the handsome villas and terraces on the Grange Road ; others oc cupied equally conspicuous positions in the well-kept gardens, or overlooking windows ; but still there was a vast majority who had to rest contented with a lengthy sojourn on the damp and greasy pathways along the roadside. Many of the more immediate friends, however, made their way into the park which surrounds the re- sidence of the deceased, and, while some entered the mansion for the purpose of taking a last look at the coffined body, the re- mainder assembled on the terraces near the conservatory in readi- ness to take their allotted places in the procession. It had been decided\u2014 in obedience to the express wishes of the lamented gen- tleman \u2014 that the iuneral should be of the simplest possible cha- racter, and hence a plain hearse, drawn by a single horse, was the only vehicle provided by the family. Notwitstanding this arrange- ment, there was a large attendance of private carriages \u2014 amongst the number being that of the Earl of Zetland \u2014 but these all waited on the Giange Road, between Southend Lodge and Polam Hall Gates, until the proper time arrived for following the mourners on their journey to the grave. About two o'clock the body was silently removed from the house, and raised into the unpretending little hearse by a number of sorrowing friends. It was encased in a plain oak coffin, without any other ornamentation than was afforded by the small brass plate on which were inscribed the name, date of death, and age of the departed. The utmost silence was observed by all the vast assembly, and scarcely a covered head was discern- ible along the entire route. On arriving at the door of the Friends' Meeting House in Skinnergate, the leading deputations formed themselves to the right and Jest of the porch until the family and private friends had entered, and in this way all confusion or crushing was prevented. The coffin, on being again removed, was carried through the chapel without any delay whatever, and at once deposited on the side of the vault prepared for its reception. The sward of the spacious burial ground had been entirely covered with wood planks, so as to protect the feet of the visitors from"], [235, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 197 damp ; while a spacious canvas awning was reared in such a way as to shelter them from any inclemency of the weather. Under this canopy the mourners assembled as rapidly as ever they could make their way through the chapel, and, as they quickly took their places round the open grave, they lapsed into a silence of the most impressive and solemn description. For fully ten minutes there was not a word uttered, the only sounds heard being the footfalls of visitors over the loose flooring ; but at the expiration of this time, and without any previous introduction, Mr. Joseph Bevan Braithwaite, of London, commenced an earnest address from the centre of the bystanders, in which he alluded feelingly to the solem nity of the occasion which had brought them together, and to the encouragement which the living ought to obtain from the lessons of the deceased's earthly career. Mr. Edward Backhouse, of Sun derland, also volunteered some admirable remarks on the necessity of preparing for the end which must inevitably come to all ; and was followed almost immediately by an appropriate prayer from Mr. Isaac Sharp, of Middlesborough. Another long silence having ensued, the coffin was lowered into the vault, and the company then slowly returned to the meeting-house for the purpose of attending worship. February 17. \u2014 Mr Hare, of Grey Street, gave a grand morning concert in the Town Hall, Newcastle. A numerous and fashionable audience occupied the hall upon the occasion, and amongst those present were Earl Vane and a party of friends. Vocalists \u2014 Madlle. Titiens, Madlle. Colombo, Madlle. Mara. Madlle. Victoria Bundsen (of the Royal Opera, Stockholm), and Madlle. Marie Marimon ; Signor Foli, Signor Mendiorez, Signor Vizzani, Signor Agnesi, Signor Borella, and Signor Tesseman. Instrumentalists \u2014 Madlle. Elise Jansen, solo harp, Madlle Teressa Carreno, solo grand piano forte. Conductors\u2014 Signor Tito Mattei, M. Maton, and Mr. F. H, Cowen. The programme was of a miscellaneous character, and em braced selections Ire m the greatest masters of operatic and oratorical music. The public were much indebted to Mr. Hare for the opportunity of hearing so many great artistes. Madlle. Titiens was in fine voice, and created a perfect furore by the singing of the recitative and air from Pacini's \" Niobe.\" The air is enriched with a wealth of the most graceful fioriture, and the rendering of it by the great soprano was simply superb. In the second part Madlle. Titiens gave Arditi's charming valse \"II Bacio\" splendidly, and com plying with the enthusiastic encore, sung \" Home, sweet Home\" with what pathos and effect need not be mentioned. Madlle. Marimon was great in the Shadow song from \" Dinorah,\" but was not heard to such advantage in the two new valses. Signor Agnesi, Signor Mendiorez, Signor Foli, and Signor Borella were very suc cesful, and the buffo duet between the last-named from Rossini's \" II Turco in Italia\" was one of the great treats of the concert. February 24 \u2014 A most melancholy beat accident occured on the"], [236, "[a.d. 1872. 198 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF river Wear between Byers Green and Willington. Persons going between Willington aud Byers Green are taken across in a boat, which is usually drawn over by a chain stretched across the river. At this time, however, the river was very much swollen, and a man named Wm Lowdon, about 50 years of age, employed as a platclayer at Byers Green Colliery, wished to cross from the latter place to Willington. The ferryman, considering it unsafe to cross by the usual mode, took the boat some distance further up the river, and Lowdon got in to be ferried over. A very strong cur rent was running at the time, and the boat was speedily carried down towards the chain, which was now only a short distance from the water. The boatman, seeing the danger, called upon Lowdon to keep his head down, so that they could pass under, but the un fortunate man apparently had not heard him, and was dragged out of the boat, which was carried a considerable distance down the stream. Lowdon caught hold of the chain, and clung to it for a considerable time, ever and anon being plunged under water by the vibration of the suspended chain until at length, utterly ex hausted, he relinquished his hold and was carried away by the rapid current. February 25. \u2014 This evening, about half-past seven o'clock, two vessels \u2014 the Rival and the Messenger, both of Blyth \u2014 came into the bay and took up their anchorage ground in close proximity to the Season Sea Rocks. The lifeboat was got in readiness, but was not launched, it being considered that the vessels were in a position of perfect safety The coastguardsmen, however, took out their boat, and having spoken the vessels, they were returning when a heavy sea struck the boat, and earned Mr. Redman (the chief officer) overboard and swept away the oars from the rest of the crew. The boat became unmanageable, and the next sea that came capsized her and left the brave fellows struggling in the water. Redman, Boyce, and Cullen managed to get on shore with the aid of their lifebelts, in a very exhausted condition. Unfortunately, two of their crew, named Higgins and Porter, were drowned. February 27. \u2014 A national thanksgiving for the recovery of the Prince of Wales, took place this day. A special service was held in St. Nicholas' Church, Newcastle on-Tyne, when the Deputy- Mayor and several members of the Town Council, the Lord-Justices, the Consuls, the Artillery, Engineer, and Rifle Corps, and a vast congregation of the general public, were present on the occasion. Upon no occasion within the memory of the present generation had the noble edifice been so densely crowded. The chancel and transept were filled to overflowing, and the nave for the most part was occupied by persons who, though totally unable to take part in the service, yet were gratified by hearing the magnificent anthem which was sung on the occasion. The congregation was particularly attentive and earnest, and the voice of the preacher, the Vicar of"], [237, "A.D. 1872. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 199 Newcastle, was heard most distinctly, as he forcibly and eloquently expounded the words of the text. Similar services were held in the churches and chapels of Newcastle, and the whole of Northum berland and Durham. March 1. \u2014 The Team Valley Railway, from Newcastle to the South, was opened this day for passenger traffic. March 9. \u2014 The will of Jos Pease, Esq., of Southend, near Dar lington, whose death took place on the 7th February, was proved in the Durham District Registry of Her Majesty's Court of Pro bate, by his executors. The will was very voluminous, extending over 29 sheets of \"brief\" paper, aud numbered 184 folios. The personalty was sworn under \u00a3350,000, and the probate duty there on was \u00a34,500. His executors and trustees were his sons, Joseph Whitwell Pease, Esq., M.P. for South Durham ; Edward Pease, Esq. ; Arthur Pease, Esq. ; and Gurney Pease, Esq. The will was dated the 15th September, 1869 By it he directed that all his annual and other subscriptions, whether for meetings, schools, lor other religious or charitable institutions under the management of the Society of Friends, to which he was a subscriber for twelve months preceding his death, should be continued to be paid free of legacy duty for twelve months after his death, with power to aug ment such subscriptions. He left the undermentioned legacies to the following schools : \u2014 To the Friends' School at Ackworth, near Pontefract ; the Friends' North of England School for Agriculture at Great Ayton, near Stokesley ; and the Friends' School at Brook field, near Wigton, Cumberland, he bequeathed \u00a3200 each. The Friends' School at Rawdon, near Leeds ; the Friends' School at Brookfield, near Moira, County Down, Ireland ; the Friends' School at Sibford, near Banbury, Oxford ; the Friends' School at Sidcot, near Weston-super-Mare ; the Friends' School at Penketh, near Warrington ; and the Friends' School at Croyden, Surrey, each re ceived \u00a3100. The British and Foreign Bible Society, London, got \u00a3100, and the Religious Tract Society, London, \u00a325. To the Darlington Preparative Meeting of the Society of Friends he left \u00a3200 to be invested, and the annual produce to be applied, under the direction of such meeting, in or towards assisting such persons, whether members or attenders of the Darlington Meeting of Friends as shall, in the judgment of its overseers, appear most needy or deserving. To his three daughters-in-law \u2014 Mrs. J. W. Pease, Mrs. Edward Pease, and Mrs. Arthur Pease \u2014 he left \u00a3100 each as small tokens of his true affection. To each of his grand-children he be queathed \u00a310 as a small memento ot his love, with the desire that they may all be humble and devoted followers of the crucified Saviour. Each of his sisters-in-law was remembered with a small legacy ; and to his cousin, Hannah Coates, of Smelt House, near Crook, he gave \u00a3100 \" in affectionate remembrance of her constant love to me and mine.\" To his valued friends, Samuel Hare, of Dar lington, and Isaac Sharp, of Middlesborough, he bequeathed \u00a3100"], [238, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 200 each \" as a small token of my affectionate regard, and as an en couragement to persevere in the path of duty.\" To each of his domestic servants he left a year's wages, irrespective of any perqui sites. To his trustees he bequeathed \u00a3l8,5'*0, to be invested for the benefit of his daughters, Emma Gurney Pease and Jane Gurney Pease, \u00a316,000 for the benefit of Mrs. Elizabeth Lucy Fowler, and \u00a320,000 for Mrs. Rachel Leatham, for their lives, and afterwards for their children. To John Ernest Fowler (son of John Fowler, Esq., and the above Mrs. Fowler) he bequeathed \u00a31,000 absolutely on bis attaining twenty-one ; and until that event his trustees were empowered, out of his residuary estate, to raise a yearly sum of \u00a340, to be paid to his mother towards his maintenance, education, and advancement. His mansions and estates at Southend, Darlington, and Marske, with all the furniture, &c, therein, he bequeathed to his trustees, upon trust, to suffer each or the only one of his daughters, Jane Gurney Pease, and Emma Gurney Pease, living and unmarried, to occupy his Southend and Marske estate, furni ture, and effects, without paying any rent for two years after his death, and providing for that period a home for his son, Charles Pease, if inclined to reside with him or her. At the expiration of that period of occupation the Southend and Marske furniture and effects were to be valued. After that event, then the Misses Jane and Emma, and Mr. Charles Pease, residing at his Southend man sion, were to have the option of selecting in succession such specific portions of the Southend and Marske furniture as should not exceed \u00a3300. His interest in the firm of \" Robert Stephenson and Co.,\" he minutely referred to, and left specific directions as to the nett profits arising from his shares in that partnership. His Southend estate and mansion at Marske, which for many years he had usually occupied during part of the year, and the residue of his freehold, copyhold, and real estate, which he might have, or be in possession of, at his death, and the residue of his personal estate he bequeathed to his trustees upon trust to call in his residuary personal estate and sell the real estate, and after the payment of his debts, funeral, and testamentary expenses upon trust as to two-third parts divided into twenty-one portions, five of which was to be in trust for his son, J. W. Pease, Esq., M.P., absolutely, and the remaining sixteen were to be in trust for his sons Edward, Arthur, Gurney, absolutely in equal shares. The remaining third was to be invested and divided into as many equal shares as the number of the present and future children \u2014 living at the period of final division \u2014 of his five sons, Joseph Whitwell, Edward, Arthur, Gurney, and Charles, one of such share to be alloted in respect of each child. Until the period of final division the annual produce of such third portion of the residue was to be divided among his said five sons. The capital belonging to testator in the firm of Henry Pease and Company \" is to remain with such firm for the time being, carrying on the business now carried on by the said firm, if any descendant or descendants of my late honoured father, Edward Pease, shall be a"], [239, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 201 partner therein,\" at interest. He recited that as his dear son, J. W. Pease, Esq., to whom he intended giving the option of purchas ing his Southend estate, had selected Hutton, near Guisbro', as his place of residence when not occupied by his Parliamentary duties, and as his sons, Edward, Arthur, and Gurney, are provided with residences, he gives directions as to the sale both of the mansion and estate at Darlington and Marske to . his sons mentioned at prices below , valuation. His interest in \" the Middlesbrough estate\" he bequeathed specifically, and his Uplands estate he gave Mrs. Leatham and family the option of occupying at a nett yearly rent. March 14. \u2014 This day, at a levee in Buckingham Palace, the Queen conferred the honour of knighthood on Mr. Aid. Joseph Cowen, M.P. for Newcastle, aud Chairman of the Tyne Improve ment Commission. March 19. \u2014 The interesting ceremony of laying the foundation stone of St. Cuthbert's Church, Hebburn, took place in the pre sence of a numerous concourse of ladies and gentlemen. The church comprises nave, transept, and chancel, and will accommo date 600 persons. The proceedings were preceded by a service, which was conducted by the Rev. G. A. Ormsby, Rector of Jarrow, and the Ven. Archdeacon of Lindisfarne, and the choir of the Jarrow Church sang the Te Deum, The trowel was presented to Mrs. R. Carr-Ellison by Mr. Torrence, of Hebburn, in the name of the Building Committee. The following inscription was engraved on the trowel : \u2014 \" Presented to Mrs. R. Carr-Ellison, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of St. Cuthbert's Church, Hebburn on-Tvne, Jarrow, on the 19th of March, 1872.\" In the cavity of the stone was placed a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and copies of the local papers. The weather being severe, the ser vice at the stone was curtailed, and the company adjourned to the Mechanics' Institute, Hebburn Quay, where a numerous company sat down to an excellent tea. March 19. \u2014 Died, at Whitworth Park, in the county of Dur ham, Catherine Duncombe Shafto, relict of R. E. Duncombe Shafto, Esq., in the 102nd year of her age. March 24. \u2014 The Baptist Church, Consett, celebrated the open ing of their new chapel by special services, in which large congregations united. Able sermons were preached by the Rev. Mr. Rust, Primitive Methodist, in the afternoon ; and in the morning and evening by the Rev. Mr. Pipe, Baptist, North Shields. On the following day a public tea meeting was held in the chapel. About 400 persons took tea, after which a public meeting was held. The monetary proceeds of the services were very satisfactory. This iron chapel is a handsome and commodious building, calcu lated to seat 340 persons. The chapel has a vestry and baptistry, and cost, with stone foundation and the ground, \u00a3450. z"], [240, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 202 March 29. \u2014 This day, the foundation stone of a new Wesleyan Chapel was laid at Breckon Hill, county of Durham, by Mrs. T. Robson, in the presence of a large number of spectators. The chapel, which will seat upwards of 200 persons, is built of fire bricks, with coloured brick quoins and string courses, and forms the most striking object in the village. After the ceremony 250 sat down to an excellent tea, and in the evening a public meeting was held in the chapel. April 2. \u2014 A grand bazaar, in aid of the funds for the erection of Archbishop Longley's Memorial Church, St. Philip's parish, New castle, was formally opened by the Right Hon. T. E. Headlam, M.P. Some four years previous the Ecclesiastical Commissioners constituted the parish a district of St. Philip's, and endowed it out of rectorial tithes with a sum of \u00a3200 per annum, and a further sum of \u00a3100 per annum so soon as a church should be erected within the bounds of the district. The bazaar fund in aid of the building fund was taken up readily by the ladies resident in the new district, and others throughout the town, and the result was evident in one of the finest exhibitions of the kind ever witnessed in Newcastle. Five spacious \" tents\" ranged along either side of the room, splendidly canopied with coloured muslin, and surmounted each by a miniature trophy of flags pinnacled with a spear-topped banneret, the numbers of the stalls being also connected with small octagon medallions. As a supplemental attraction exhi: bited in one of the side rooms, a \" high art gallery by very old masters,'' created a great furore, giving the very greatest of satisfaction to its patrons. The Rev. Mr. Shepherd briefly intro duced Mr Headlam, who then came forward, aud said\u2014 His experience of Newcastle was certainly this, that when anything was taken up, and especially by the ladies of the town, it was done so heartily and cordially that it was sure to succeed. The com mittee who had undertaken the building of this church, and who had organized the bazaar with the object of raising the necessary funds for the purpose, had asked him to state generally to the people of Newcastle his opinion as to the advisability of the con tribution to be made, and the good likely to result from it. After examining the case conscientously, he could thoroughly and heartily recommend it to the people of Newcastle as one in which all friends of the Church, and of those who took an interest in the promotion of religion in the town could come forward and perform a really valuable, good, aud most beneficial work for the whole town. They knew the district better than he did. Arthur's Hill was now covered by the dwellings of artizans and workpeople of various kinds, who could not be expected to raise a church for themselves. The population, he was surprised to find, numbered eleven or twelve thousand people, showing a wonderfully rapid increase at that end ; and at present there was at that part no established Church of this country, and consequently a great want was felt just now, to satisfy which the exertions of the people"], [241, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS'. 203 themselves only depended. Under these circumstances the matter came before the whole of the people of Newcastle, but in a most favourable way. \u00a3300 had been set apart for the endowment of the edifice \u2014 of which \u00a3200 was now given \u2014 and the other \u00a3100 would be forthcoming as soon as the church was completed, and it was therefore very desirable that the whole scheme should be car ried into effect as soon as possible. There could be no difficulty, as the church need not be very elaborate or extensive, and the whole would be done under \u00a34,000. Of that sum had been raised or promised \u00a32,000, so there remained not a great deal to be con tributed by the people of Newcastle. But the mode by which this had been proposed to be carried out they now saw around them. There were some objections to bazaars, but they also had their advantages. They enlisted a large number of persons, who felt they had an interest in the success of the entertainment, and also a great number of ladies worked vigorously and actively to produce elegant articles for purchasers. Then also to the town in general a benefit accrued, for to the public objects of interest were announced in full, and the contributions made were for the best of objects. If they succeeded, it was not a trifling good they achieved, but something to last as long as time for the town's own good and the promotion of religious feeling. He had great pleasure in declaring the bazaar opened, and he had now only to ask them to do their share of the work in order to ensure a hearty and complete success. April 11. \u2014 The ministerial jubilee of the Rev. J. Anderson, .DD., pastor of St. George's Presbyterian Church, Morpeth, took place under the most gratifying and auspicious circumstances. The day's programme comprised a public dinner, under the presidency of the Mayor of Morpeth (Mr. G. B. Chirney), and a public meet ing in the evening, at which addresses of congratulation, as well as the presentation of a magnificent silver epergne and \u00a3600, to the esteemed pastor, who had just completed the fiftieth year of his ministry. Owing to the high esteem in which the venerable doctor was held by all classes in the town and district, a very numerous company of ministers and friends were present to do him honour, and to show their great appreciation of the faithful and assiduous manner in which his labours of half-a-century had been discharged. About 150 gentlemen sat down to the repast. The Mayor was supported by the Rev. Dr. Anderson ; the Right Hon. Sir George Grey, Bart. ; Mr. J. C. Stevenson, M.P., South Shields ; the Rev. Dr. Bruce, Newcastle ; the Rev. R. Leitch, New castle ; Dr. Cairns, Berwick ; the Rev. T. W. Brown, Moderator of the U.P. Synod. The vice-chairs were occupied by the Rev. J. A. Craig, Moderator, and the Rev. J. A. Blyth, Clerk to the Northumberland Presbytery. The public meeting was held in St. George's Church, and the large edifice was densely crowded in every part. The chaste and beautiful epergne, which formed part of the gift to Dr. Anderson, was conspicuously displayed in front of the platform, and was greatly admired by all who were privileged to"], [242, "204 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1872. inspect it. The chair on the occasion was occupied by the Rev. T. W. Brown, of Newcastle, Moderator of the Synod. April 16. \u2014 The rejoicings in honour of the marriage of the Mar quis of Bute were unhappily marred by an explosion of gunpowder at Dipton, this evening, by which eight persons were severely in jured, besides several others being more or less burnt. The explosion took place in a building used as a blacksmith's and fitting shop, occupied by a young man named John Fenwick, son of the proprietor of the Marquis of Bute's Arms Inn, Dipton, where the festivites were being held. It appears that on the approach of dark, the party who had charge of the cannon-firing, for the purpose of preparing fireworks for the further amusement of the inhabitants of the village, adjourned to the fitting shop, when one of the num ber imprudently made too free with the gunpowder by allowing some to ignite in his hand, which he inadvertently threw amoEgst that stored in a cask. The report was by no means loud, but the force immediately rendered the place a mass of ruins. A scene of the wildest excitement then ensued, the villagers rushing to the spot fearing that some one had been killed. Fortunately, however, it was soon ascertained that such was not the case. Immediate attention was given to those who had been injured, and everything possible was done to alleviate their sufferings. April 18, \u2014 The foundation stone of a very handsome new chapel, for the Primitive Methodists of Middleton-in Teesdale, was laid by Mr. Charles Pease, of Darlington, the interesting proceedings being witnessed by a large and gaily-attired concourse of spectators. The ceremony, which was of an extremely simple description, took place amid a biting shower of hail. After a brief religious service \u2014 conducted by the Rev. Mr. Watts, and the Rev. Mr. Purvis \u2014 the stone was properly adjusted by Mr. Pease, and at once declared well and truly laid. On the subsidence of the cheering which was elicited by this announcement, Mr. Pease addressed the assemblage. He said the voluntary system had done much in the past, and would yet do more. He had recently come from Ireland, where he found that the abolition of the Established Church had worked satisfactory results. The zeal it had given to religion was clearly showing the wisdom of Parliament, aud, therefore, he thought it would not be very long before we saw in this country some great advances in the same direction\u2014 Before the people dispersed, a handsomely-bound copy of the Rev. J. A. Bastow's \" Biblical Dic tionary\" was presented to Mr. Pease as a memento of the stone laying ; while a second copy was awarded to Mr. R. W. Bainbridge, of the London Lead Company, as a slight recognition of the many valuable services he had rendered to the denomination. The building is constructed in the Italian style of architecture \u2014 the exterior being of rubble stone, with polished freestone dressings ; it is excellently fitted and lighted, and with the aid of a spacious gal lery, will furnish comfortable sittings for 600 or 700 people."], [243, "A.D. 1872.

He was a native of the Teams, near Gateshead, and was batized at Whickham Church, in October, 1761, the register of the performance being extant. In early life he was a keelman on the Tyne. He was pressed during the great Continental war, and served on board the Pomona war ship while Nelson was achieving his famous victories. Afterwards he was employed at Bedlington iron works, in convey ing the manufactured goods down the river to the port of Blyth. He became an inmate of the workhouse two years prior to, his decease, and was able to move about till within a week of his death. He was among the inmates, in the dining-room, when they were entertained to tea at Easter by Lady Elizabeth Grey His depar ture from this life was announced to the town by a muffled peal. May 2. \u2014 The churchwardens of St. Nicholas, and other gentle men, met the Rev. George Cockshott, at one time curate of that church, in the vestry this afternoon, for the purpose of presenting him with a handsome French clock, together with a purse contain ing \u00a340, as a mark of their respect and esteem. Mr. Hara, senior churchwarden, who presided on the occasion, said Mr. Alderman Ingledew was so poorly he could not attend the meeting, but sent his best wishes through him (the chairman) and Mr. Sewell to their friend Mr. Cockshott, and hoped that gentleman would long live to enjoy the testimonial that had to be presented to him. They had bad Mr. Cockshott with them for about thirteen months, .and the congregation of St. Nicholas were well pleased both with him and Mr. Jupp. Mr. Jupp made many friends, as did also Mr. Cockshott, and the offertory of the friends of the latter stood before them that day. He had great pleasure in presenting the timepiece and the purse containing \u00a340 to Mr. Cockshott, who, he hoped, would long remember the old church of St. Nicholas, the church wardens, and all the friends he made while he was curate there. \u2014 The rev. gentleman feelingly thanked them for their kindness, and the company shortly afterwards separated.

May 5. \u2014 A disastrous fire occurred this morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, at Stanton, Northumberland, in the stack-yard of a Mr. Appleby, farmer, when six stacks of corn were destroyed, and other serious damage done to the out-buildings. May 6. \u2014 Mr W. L. Dodd, editor of the Darlington and Stockton Times, died at Darlington, this morning. Mr. Dodd slipped his foot on entering his honse by the back door, which opens close upon a rather dangerous flight of steps leading to the kitchen. He was precipitated with great force to the bottom, and alighting on his head, fractured the base of the skull. Notwithstanding the medical skill brought to his relief he expired from the injuries received. Mr. Dodd was a native of North Shields, and was the eldest son of Dr. Dodd, well known as a scholar and local antiquary, and for a great portion of his life as the master of the Tynemouth Grammar School. Mr. W. L. Dodd after being educated at his father's school, was articled to the legal profession in the offices of Messrs. Lietch and Kewney, solicitors, North Shields, arid passed as a solicitor. Six years prior to his demise, he abandoned the legal profession and went to Darlington, and after being a few months a contributor to the South Durham Mercury, then published at Hartlepool, he became the editor of the Darlington and Stockton Times and the Darlington Mercury, a position he had retained, with a few weeks interval, up to the time of his death. May 8. \u2014 An inquest was held to enquire into the death of John Murphy and Thomas Caffry, miners, both of whom died from injuries received by an explosion of gas at Blaydon Main Colliery. From the evidence adduced it appeared that the men, who were hewers, had \" holed\" into an old working, the gas from which had exploded on their naked lights. It was also elicited that the men had disregarded the instructions of the deputy-overman, and con sequently an open verdict was returned. May 8. \u2014 An inquest was held this evening on the body of a young woman, who had died through absorbing the poisonous matter from lead, whilst employed at the Ouseburn white lead works. It was shown at the inquest that there was neither soap, towels, or water at the works for the work people to wash the lead from their hands, and the jury appended a censure to their verdict on the system of conducting the works. May 10. \u2014 At an early hour this morning the Rev. James Everett, the venerable Wesleyan Reformer, author, and preacher, died at his residence, Tavistock Place, Sunderland. He was born in Aln wick, the county town of Northumberland, on the 16th May, 1784, so that he had all but attained the extraordinary age of 88. His grandfather, on the maternal side, James Bowmaker, was a master builder in Alnwick, and his father, who was the husband of a daughter of Mr. Bowmaker, was at the same time in the town, although he was originally a native of Huntingdon. When John Wesley first visited the north, James Bowmaker connected himself"], [245, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 207 with him, and his first wife, Jenny Keith \u2014 connected with the Keiths of Scotland \u2014 was a correspondent of the great Methodistic patriarch, and some of his letters to her were published in the early volumes of the Arminian Magazine. Everett's mother, by Bowmaker's second wife, was also a Wesleyan, and died in 1839, in the 83rd year of her age. He united himself to the Wesleyan body in 1803, and in 1849, when the connection was dissolved, we have three links of the same unbroken chain in Wesleyan Methodism, stretching through a period of upwards of one hundred years. Besides James, there were a brother and sister older than he, who both lived to the advanced age of 83. Like many men afterwards distinguished, such as Goldsmith and Sir Walter Scott, James Everett had at first little delight in learning, although his capacity was from the first unquestionable. He preferred hunting and fishing, and when not employed in these genial exercises, he threw his soul into drawing and music. May 14. \u2014 The pleasant and picturesque fishing village of New biggin-by-the-Sea was the scene of much festivity, the occasion being the annual perambulation by the freeholders ofthe boundaries of their lauds. For many generations the freeholders of Newbiggin, who occupy a similar position and enjoy nearly similar privileges to the freemen in other places, have been in the habit of riding the boundaries of all open and common land, in order to show their title to it, and formerly the ceremony was of a somewhat imposing character. Unlike the freemen in many towns, the freeholders of Newbiggin have at all times been amongst the most progressive of the inhabitants of the place ; and everywhere in this thriving little town there are signs of progress and improvement : houses have sprung up in a number of places, the rugged and uneven pathways have given place to level cemented ones, the refuse which was for merly allowed to accumulate on the beach has been removed, and the road to the moor has been more passable than it was in times past. The time fixed for the commencement of the interesting ceremony was half- past ten o'clock, and before that time a large number of children had congregated at the bottom of Front Street, waiting for the procession to set out. It was near eleven o'clock before a start was made, and then the freeholders, headed by the steward, who was the only horseman, proceeded up the Front Street. At the top of this street they went round the corner into Skelton's Yard, which was paced round by each and every one, and after this had been done with due formality the party were sud denly besieged by a large number of children, and then the cause of the great interest taken by the budding fishermen and fishwives of Newbiggin in the ceremony became apparent. Large quantities of nuts and raisins were scrambled among the children, and the procession was about to renew its progress when a humourous con flict arose in consequence of an attempt on the part of red-faced, bare-legged fisher-girls to possess themselves of a large bag of nuts which a1 Mr. James Muters was carrying. From Skelton's Yard,"], [246, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 208 round the back of the Lifeboat House \u2014 where there was more fruit and nuts thrown to the children \u2014 the procession went by Prospect Place and Spice Hill, on the edge of the moor. Here a general halt was made, whilst the children following were gratified by having an unlimited number of raisins and nuts thrown to them. From this point the freeholders went rouud Maud's Pool to the western boundary fence of the moor, along which they passed, scrambling fruit at short intervals all the way till they came to the \" dunting stone.\" It is customary to take freeholders when they have been newly-elected to this \" dunting stone,\" and, holding them up by the ancles and the wrists, to \" dunt\" them against the stone ; no man, however good his titles may otherwise be to fellowship of this body, being able to claim its privileges until he has undergone this operation. After a long delay here, which was occupied by more scrambling, another move was made, and soon the extreme northern boundary of the moor \u2014 the Liniefield Gate \u2014 was reached. At a distance of about 100 yards south of the gate they were met by a farmer, who caught the steward's horse by the head, and for bade him to advance a step further, as the rest of the land from that spot was his. This interruption did not give the freeholders much concern, as they did nothing but \" chaff\" the claimant, and at length bought off* his opposition with sweets. The procession then crossed the moor to the east, and proceeded down to the shore, which is also claimed by the freeholders, and followed the beach down to the Church Point On the way back a large party of fishermen gathering bait were fallen in with, aud a goodtempered and ludicrous skirmish ensued between this band and the custodians of the fruit and nuts, resulting in favour of the former, who, how ever, magnanimously yielded their prizes on achieving their victories From the Church Point the party proceeded across the bay to the west of Windsor Terrace, where they climbed up the links, came on to the North Season Road at Spittal Cottage, and passing the common land on the way, returned to the spot from whence they started. May 14. \u2014 A well-stocked bazaar was opened in St. Cuthbert's School-room, Blaydon, for the purpose of raising funds for a new organ in the parish church. May 14. \u2014 The remains ofthe late Rev. James Everett the famous Wesleyan Reformer and preacher were interred next to the remains of his late wife, on the unconsecrated side ofthe Sunderland Parish Cemetery, in Ryhope Road. The funeral was attended by a large number of the deceased minister's friends, followers, and admirers. At eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the mourners assembled at the deceased's residence in Tavistock Place, and then proceeded to the United Methodist Free Church, South Durham Street. At the Tabernacle, as the South Durham Street Chapel is called, a large congregation had assembled in the gallery, and, on the arrival of the funeral procession, the mourners and friends took their places"], [247, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 209 in the body ofthe chapel. The coffin which was of oak, with silver handles and plate, bearing the simple inscription of the deceased minister's name, age, aud dates of birth and death, was placed on a stand in front of the communion rails, and covered with a pall. The platform-pulpit was draped with black cloth, and on it the gentlemen who were to take part in the funeral services took their places. The \" Dead March in Saul\" was played on the organ while the coffin was being carried up the aisle, and added consider able effect to the solemnity of the service. The Rev. A. A. Rees read a portion of scripture, and, after the singing of a hymn, the Rev. R. Chew delivered a funeral oration, giving a sketch of tho deceased's life and public labours. He adverted in feeling terms to the deceased's character, virtues, and abundant public labours as a preacher and an author, and paid a high tribute to the splendid abilities of which Mr. Everett had made so liberal a use for the good of his fellow men. May 15. \u2014 A destructive fire broke out in the iron-shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Davison and Stokoe, at Southwick, Sunderland, aud such was the fierceness of the flames that the reflection illumi nated nearly the whole town, aud people ran in all directions to ascertain the seat of the conflagration. The county officers at South wick, with the fire apparatus of that village, were soon on the spot, but Sergt. Cuthbertson of the county constabulary, was disabled by a falling beam, which broke one of his legs. The Sunderland Police lire-brigade were not sent for on the outbreak of the fire, but at tracted by the glare they made their way ultimately to the spot, to find on their arrival that the joiners' shops and sheds, in which the fire originated, had been completely burnt to the ground. The loss from the destruction of stock and machinery was very considerable. May 18. \u2014 The official inspection of the 2ud Durham Artillery Volunteers was held at Seaham Harbour, when, in consequence of a gratifying presentation to Earl Vane, the occasion was almost made to assume the character of a great gala day. The men of the regiment left their armoury early in the afternoon, and after march ing to the beautiful terrace which overlooks the sea, were drawn up in line to the admiration of the hundreds of people who had assembled to witness the interesting proceedings. A spacious platform \u2014 erected immediately in front of the Russian gun \u2014 had been prettily embellished with a covering of maroon, blue, and light pink cloths ; while, from many points overhead, an extremely gay profusion of bunting was kept in unceasing motion by the cold sharp north-easteily gusts which blew so keenly over the water. The weather, fortunately, was fine and bright, and, therefore, the white sails of passing vessels and the flying spray of the angry breakers imparted to the seaward view an aspect of great animation and beauty. Conspicuously placed ou the platform was a handsome gold vase which it was pr. posed to present to his lordship, and also a a"], [248, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 210 the beautifully illuminated address which had to accompany it. The design of the vase was Grecian in form, was admirably cut and finished, aud stood nearly three feet in height. The address, which had been prepared under the superintendence of Captain James Lindsay, was in the style of the 15th century, and the rich illuminations were mounted in a frame of four feet by three. It was signed by all the officers and men, above 600 in number. Shortly before two o'clock, and at a time when the terrace was crowded with gaily-dressed spectators, a general salute from the men announced that the noble earl and his suite had arrived upon the ground. The presentation was made by Major Mann in an appropriate speech, to which the noble earl replied in very effective terms. May 21. \u2014 Lord Ravensworth performed the ceremony of laying the chief corner stone of a new church at Burnopfield, near Gates head, dedicated to St. James \u2014 a new ecclesiastical district formed out of the chapelry of Tanfield. The site, which had been given by Mr. Huntley, is behind a picturesque cluster of trees, immedi ately over the brow of the upland east of Rowland's Gill, in the valley of the Derwent, and commanding one of the most extensive panoramas of landscape to be found in the North of England. The style of architecture is the early English, with nave, transept, south aisle, organ chamber, and timber porch and bell gable. The sittings are free and open, and capable of accommodating about 320 persons. The church is 80 feet long by 40 feet wide, and cost \u00a32,200. The services were commenced by the Rev. T. Stirrup, the first incumbent of the new ecclesiastical district of St. James's, who welcomed his lordship amongst them on that most auspicious occasion. After briefly adverting to the rapid increase of the popu lation in the parish, the Rev. Mr. Mathwin, Vicar of Tanfield, pre sented a splendid silver trowel, bearing a suitable inscription, to Lord Ravensworth. His lordship then stepped forward, and went through the usual formality of declaring the stone laid, and recited the appointed prayer, \" In the name of,'' &c. In the cavity of the stone was placed a large bottle containing newspapers and coins of the period, and a Latin inscription. May 23. \u2014 The ceremony of dedicating the New Freemasons' Hall, Maple Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, took place in the lodge room of the building, a very large number of the members of the craft being present on the occasion. The hall consists of two stories and basement, with various outbuildings. In the basement is a spacious banqueting hall, connected with which are the necessary ante-rooms, lavatory, and kitchen, the latter containing all the latest improvements and fittings in culinary art. On the first floor is the lodge room, adjoining which are the tyler's room, retiring, and sitting rooms. The lodge room is 46 feet by 24 feet, and 21 feet high in the clear; the ceiling is formed of wrought and moulded braces and ribs. On the second floor there is a very ele-"], [249, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 211 gant club room with covered ceiling. The building is of stone, and the front is Gothic of early treatment, deeply revealed, and sym bolically carved in parts, giving to the whole a bold and effective character. At the east end of the hall a very beautifully carved wood screen is erected over the dais, extending from north to south, formed in canopied compartments. In masonic architecture it is a new and most attractive feature, and vividly brings to mind the fine effect of the carved stalls in some of our old cathedrals. The screen is erected for the purpose of supporting a handsome stained glass window, consisting of masonic figures and emblems, expressly designed, not only as a means of decoration, but as dis playing a series of subjects of a highly moral and instructive character, visible in the interior of the hall at night time as an elaborate transparency, illuminated by means of gas light reflected from behind the screen. The architectural arrangement of the windows in the east gable having been strictly carried out in the screen also renders the windows attractive during daylight as an excellent and interesting specimen of the stained glass art, con sisting of four principal lancet headed compartments, arranged as a twin-lancet, on each side of the beautiful crocketed canopy, forming the central portion of the screen, above what is intended for the Master's chair, which is pierced with suitable taceried forms, and filled with stained glass illustrations in the following order, viz : \u2014 In the quarter-foil, at the apex, is represented the All-seeing Eye, within a halo of light, and surrounded by a circle significant of eternity. In the medalliou below this is a star of brilliant cut glass ou an azure ground, and the aperture under the star displays the masonic arms, motto, and supporters, appropriately executed on the glass. The four lights consist of large figures within elliptical forms or niches, with richly-coloured medallion emblems above, and below interlaced with suitable foliage ornamentations on a delicately tinted ground The first figure depicts Hiram Abiff, architect of the Temple, taking dimensions from a plan ; the second figure is a representation of King Solomon supporting a model of the Temple of Jerusalem ; the third illustrates a majestic figure of Hiram, King of Tyre, bearing in his right hand the sceptre of power ; and the fourth depicts a venerable figure of Moses, holding in one hand the tables of the Ten Commandments, towards which he points. The medallion emblems in the apex of the four lights are the ter restial and celestial globes, and the sun and moon ; below these are the emblems of tiuth, justice, peace, and industry; and in the base below the figures are symbolic illust) ations of faith, hope, charity, brotherly love, and unity. Devices of a similar nature occupy positions in pierced trefoils comprising the tracery sur mounting the lights. At the hour appointed for the commence ment of the dedication ceremony, nearly two hundred of the brethren were assembled in the building, the spacious lodge-room being well filled. It had been expected that the Right Hon. Earl Percy, Provincial Grand Master of Northumberland, would have"], [250, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 212 beeu present to preside, but early in the afternoon a letter was read from his lordship expressing his deep regret at being unable, from indisposition, to take part in the proceedings. In his absence, the Deputy Provincial Grand Master, Maving Lonsdale Cockcroft, Esq., occupied the chair, and he was supported on the dais by Lord James Murray, representative of the Grand Lodge of Scotland at the Grand Lodge of England. At the close of the ceremony the brethren dined together in the banqueting hall of the* building. May 25. \u2014 Upwards of 700 volunteers, belonging Newcastle and the neighbouring towns, had a grand field day on the Town Moor, Newcastle, and were inspected by Col. Hawkins, who expressed his approval of what he had witnessed, and promised to report favour ably of the efficiency of the Northern Volunteers. June 4. \u2014 A grand bazaar to raise funds for liquidation of the debt upon St. John's Church, Killingworth, was formally opened by the Vicar of Newcastle (Rev H, J. Martin), in the Lecture Hall of the Mechanics' Institute, New Bridge Street. The vicar, in declaring the bazaar open, trusted the three elements of success in their favour \u2014the good cause, the delightful weather, and the hand some bazaar \u2014 would be the means of realising the promoter's fondest hopes and earnest anticipations as to its prosperty. June 5. \u2014 This morning, an inquest was held at the Blue Bell Inn, Felling, touching the death of three men, named Lisle, King, aud Hannan, who were suffocated on the 29th of May, by inhaling sulphuretted hydrogen gas, at the works of the Felling Chemical Company, where the men were employed. The Coroner called on Mr. Pattinson, of the works, to explain the plans of the pit and locality where the fatal occurrence took place, and in the course of this explanation it was remarked that the drain of the shaft was being cleaned out at the time w hen the great rush of gas took place, overpowering the men, From the evidence it appeared that the men had not taken the proper precaution when descending into the chalk pit, and a verdict to that effect was returned. June 8. \u2014 The interesting ceremonies of launching a new lifeboat and formally presenting it to the trustees of the Tyne Lifeboat Fund took place at the Coble Landing, South Shields. The new lifeboat was the free gift of Mrs. T. Perry, of Harton, who placed \u00a3600 at the disposal of the Tyne Lifeboat trustees in order that the wishes of her husband should be duly carried out during her own lifetime. As soon as the gift was made known, the hon. sec retary to the fund lost no time in having the plans of the generous donor carried into effect, and designs were prepared for a new craft, which is named the Tom Perry. The following are its dimensions : \u2014 length, 33ft. ; breadth, lift. ; end depth, 31ft. ; and is made to row 12 oars \u2014 6 on each side. The launch took place from the lifeboat house, Coble Landing, and the locality was made to present quite a lively and attractive aspect by numerous streamers, flags, bannerets, &c., while the crowds of people in holiday attire"], [251, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 213 that thronged every quay and nook from which a view of the ceremony could be obtained betokened the large amount of interest that was evinced by the public of the town. The Pilot's Association kindly placed their powerful new steam tug Pilot at the disposal ofthe Tyne Life boat Fund for the occasion, and that body, conjointly with Mrs. Perry, invited a number of ladies and gentlemen to take part in the proceedings. When the steamboat reached the Coble Landing the Mayor and Mayoress, the Town Clerk, and other ladies and gentlemen landed, and proceeded to the Lifeboat House, whence the launch took place. The scene at this juncture was animated and picturesque in the extreme. Several other steam-tugs, each gaily decorated and heavily freighted with pjssengers, here joined the official steamer, and the members of the South Shields Rowing Club turned out in their tiny craft in goodly numbers, and their showy uniforms tended considerably to heighten the general effect of the scene The river at this point was also quite alive with pilot cobles and almost every description of small craft. The two old lifeboats, Tyne and Northumberland, were likewise afloat, and fully manned with pilots. The preliminaries within the boathouse having been concluded, the new and beautiful looking lifeboat was slowly moved down towards the river, and as she proceeded out of the house Miss Moore, daughter of the Mayor of South Shields, amid loud cheers, performed the ceremony of naming the boat the Tom Perry. As soon as the boat reached the river the Wellesley band struck up \" Rule Britannia,\" and played it with great spirit. The Mayor and company re-embarked after the successful launch, atid after a time had been devoted to inspecting the new boat and testing her rowing capacity, Mr. J. M. Moore (Town Clerk of South Shields,) ascended to a stat at the after end ofthe Pilot, and as the representative of Mrs. Perry formally presented the Tom Perry life boat to the trustees of the Tyne Lifeboat Fund. He sincerely and heartily trusted that whenever her services were called into requisi tion \u2014 manned as she would be by a crew of noble pilots \u2014 she would successfully accomplish the object of her mission, namely that of saving life. Referring to the establishment of the Volunteer Life Brigades Mr. Moore said that Mrs. Perry had not forgotten that noble institution, but had made provision for the payment through all futurity of \u00a312 10s. annually to each of the Volunteer Life Brigade of Tynemouth and South Shields, to be devoted for the purpose of providing refreshments, &c, to the members when engaged in their onerous and arduous duty. \u2014 The Mayor (Mr. E. Moore) said, on behalf of the trustees, he accepted, with feelings of profound gratitude, the splendid lifeboat which had been presented to them in Mrs. Perry's name. Three hearty cheers were then given for the Tom Perry, and also cheers for Mrs. Perry. \u2014 After some time spent in rowing about, the Tom Perry was laken alongside the large river fire engine, where the boys of the Wellesley training ship filled the lifeboat full of water, for the purpose of testing her capacity of discharging herself. The test was most successful."], [252, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 214 June 10. \u2014 A fire, which resulted in serious damage, broke out on the premises of Messrs. E. Mandall and Co., wholesale chemists, Tower Street, Stockton, at midnight. The building was about 80 feet long, 40 feet broad, and 45 feet high, and was stocked with oils and chemicals of various kinds. A number of policemen were speedily on the spot, and every effort was made to stop the ravages of the fire. The difficulty of finding plugs, the shortness of the hose, and the inefficient supply of water were serious drawbacks, and the premises were soon a mass of flames. P.C. Stoner, of the Stockton force, at great risk, rushed into the burning rooms and brought out a number of books, some valuable documents, and a cash box. In spite of the play of water upon the flames, the fire continued until about four o'clock, the premises being totally destroyed. The damage was estimated at from \u00a310,000 to \u00a312,000. June 12. \u2014 At Cramlington village, Emmeline Anne, the eldest daughter of Henry Shu in- Storey, Esq., of Arcot Hall, near Cram lington, was united in wedlock to Captain Shawe, of the Royal Marines, and son of Captain Shawe, of Sevres Lodge, York, and the happy event gave rise to much rejoicing in the locality where the bride's family had resided so long. In honour of the occasion the cottagers and servants had erected a number of arches of evergreens and flowers over the road from the hall to the church, the principal of these being a well-made triple arch near the Damdyke Farm, composed of ivy, laurel, and holly, with geraniums and other flowers blooming in pots in various parts of it, and a verdant and floral true lover's knot depending fiom the crown of the centre span. Flags of various colours and designs waved from every prominent point within eyeshot of Arcot or Cramlington, guns were fired from several places from the early morning till late in the evening, and the cheerful and appropriate music of the Seatou Burn Saxhorn Band augmented the festive character of the proceedings. The bridal party left the hall in si ven carnages, each drawn by a handsome pair of grey horses, driven by properly-costumed equerries. The bride was dressed in white corded satin, trimmed with Brussels lace, tulle, and bouquets of orange blossoms, with a tulle veil and wreath, and pearl ornaments. The bridesmaids, Miss Shum-Storey, Miss Shum, Miss Edith Shawe, Miss Montague frbawe, Miss Hind, and Miss Bramwell, were dressed in white tarletan trimmed with cerise, Dolly Varden caps with tulle ends, and boquets. The groomsmen were Mr. Ernest Shum, ot London ; Mr. Carr, Newcastle ; Capt Murray, 14th Brigade Royal Artillery, Newcastle ; and the Hon. Mr. Shore, of the Royal Artillery. A large number of persons assembled in the church to witness the interesting ceremony, which was performed by the Rev. C. C. Snowdon, Vicar of Mitford, assisted by the Rev. J. Smithard-Hind, D.C.L , Vicar of Cramlington. The bride was given away by her uncle, Mr. Robt. Shum-Storey, of London, and at the conclusion of the service the Wedding March was played on the organ. As they left ihe church flow ers w ere strewn by little girls ranged on each"], [253, "A.D. 1872 J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 215 side of the pathway from the porch to the gate, and the villagers set up a hearty and well-sustained cheer. The bride was the happy recipient of a large number of very handsome and costly wedding presents from her relatives and friends, all of which were displayed in the drawing room for the inspection ofthe guests. In the afternoon the school children at Cramlington aud the members of the choir were entertained in honour of the wedding. A dinner was given to tho cottagers and servants at Arcot Hall, and the fes tivities were continued for some days, when the tenants on the estate dined together at the Queeu's Head Hotel, Newcastle. June 18. \u2014 A thunderstorm of unwonted violence, and unhappily attended with the most disastrous results, broke over the North of England this afternoon. About one o'clock a few light peals of thunder were heard, but threatening as the atmospheric elements then appeared, there was nothing to indicate the terrific magnitude which the storm subsequently assumed. At two o'clock the crisis of the storm may be said to bave been reached, and about this time the sight was appallingly grand. The lightning darted from the surcharged clouds with great brilliancy and in many forms, while the thunder rolled forth with yet greater intensity. Added to this was the continuous downpour of rain. This in its turn was varied by a fall of hail of a very extraordinary character, some of the pieces of ice which descended measuring an inch, while the average was half an inch in diameter. These rattled against house windows with great violence, and many panes of glass were broken. By the heavy and long-continued fall of rain the streets were converted into perfect torrents of rushing water, and from this cause much damage to property resulted. The most nielaucholy feature of this unexampled storm, however, was the loss of life by which^it was attended, a man having been killed at Newcastle by the electric fluid, while at Tynemouth a fisherman was deprived of life^in a similar manner. At No. 3, Regent Street, Forth Street, Newcastle, a young man named William Mitchell, 22 years of age, was killed by the lightning. The account of this sad occurrence, given at the inquest, which was held on the body of the deceased, was to the following effect : \u2014 The deceased, who was employed at Hawthorn's factory, with two more of his companions, who lodged with him, had just had dinner, and they were sitting on the sofa waiting till the \" buzzar\" went. Deceased was sitting between his companions, reading a paper. There was a great deal of thunder and lightning at the time, and heavy hailstones fell. Some knives and forks were lying on the table, when the landlady remarked that they should not be left lying, and one of them named Tinsley got up for the purpose of putting them out of the way. He then went to light his pipe at the fire, and when he was returning towards the sofa he was struck down A man named McAughtry, who was sitting next to him at the time, was hurt on the leg. A medical man was sent for, who said the action of the heart would cease when deceased was struck. He had no doubt he died from the effects of"], [254, "216 ' HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. the lightning. The three young men were very respectable. In Forth Street, a short distance from Regent Street, Mrs. Anderson, wife of Sergeant Anderson of the Newcastle Police Force, was struck by the lightning. She had been staying at the house of her father, Mr. Isaac Dodds, landlord of the Hope and Anchor Inn, and for the purpose of clearing the grate of the sink at the back of the premises, she snatched up a carving fork, and whilst she was in the act of lifting the grate the lightning struck her and knocked her down. Mrs. Dodds and another person immediately went to her assistance. On finding that she was in an insensible state they carried her into the house and means were at once adopted to restore her. About half an hour elapsed before she could speak. About five o'clock in the afternoon she was sufficiently recovered to admit of being removed to her own residence. A considerable amount of damage was done by the hail and rain in Market Street. At Messrs. Bainbridge and Cos drapery establishment every pre caution was taken to protect the premises from the violence of the storm. Under the direction of Mr. Bainbridge, sen., and J. J. Brummell, a large number of the assistants were actively engaged in carrying the water out in buckets. At the adjoining establish ment, belonging to Messrs. Dunn and Co., drapers, the channels and pipes are sufficient to carry off any ordinary amount of rain, but the channels became swollen by the great pressure of water, and some of the panes in the glass root were smashed by the hail stones, so that the water came down into the shop ; and many of the customers were obliged to take shelter iu the carpet room. The rain also poured down from the balcony above the shop win dow, and before the goods, consisting chiefly of valuable silks, could be removed, a great deal of damage was done. In the silk and other rooms goods to the value of nearly \u00a3500 were seriously damaged. A very large amount of damage was done to property in Newgate Street, more especially opposite the Darn Crook (now St. Andrew's Street), down which the water flowed like a river. The street was flooded to a depth of several feet. The premises and stock of the Chancellor's Head spirit vaults, immediately in front of Darn Crook, suffered greatly, and business was entirely suspended for the remainder of the day, in consequence of the immense quantity of water which found its way into the lower portion of the building The water reached to within a few inches of the top of the bar counter, and was about four deep in the cellar, which is on a level with the bar. Mrs. Parkinson, a provision dealer, near to the above premises, also sustained considerable loss, the furniture, bedding, and clothing being very much damaged. The house of Mr. William Birrell, Ravensworth Arms, at the back part of the building, was flooded, and an amount of damage was done to his fixtures and stock. The shops of Mr. J. C. Maudlin, leather merchant; Miss Scott, hosier; and Mr. Carr, boot and shoemaker and leather merchant, were all flooded, but not to so great an extent as those of their immediate neighbours. The"], [255, "A.D. 1872 J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 217 premises of Messrs. William Millions and Co., wine merchants, at the corner of High Friar Street, were flooded to a depth of six feet in the wine cellar, and the damage done to the stock was estimated at about \u00a3500. The roof of the house of Mr. Robinson, Lord Col lingwood Inn, High Bridge, was not sufficient to withstand the tempestuous downpour of rain, which made its way into the billiard and bagatelle rooms, doing considerable damage to the furniture. In the Close several shops were flooded. Mr. Christopher Heaps, flour dealer at the foot of Tuthill Stairs, had a number of sacks of flour very much damaged. The force of the water which came in torrents down the Tuthill Stairs was so great that it broke away a large number of the stone steps, and carried them into the Close. The chimney and a portion of the stonework of the roof of a house at the west end of the same street were knocked down by the lightning. In the Cloth Market damage was done to the property of Mr. Joel, White Hart Inn, by the hail and rain, and the pre mises of Messrs. Bagnall and Blakey were also injured by being flooded. In Nelson Street, the premises of Mr. Gibson, Wallace Hotel, and Mr. Carr, provision dealer, and other tradesmen, were flooded, and considerable damage was done. The main sewer crossing the Sandhill from the Side to the river, built at a time when the town was less than half its present size, became choked up with water and burst, throwing a column of filth about five feet square to a height of eight or nine feet, and continuing to discharge itself for nearly half an hour. The water thus liberated ran in a rapid torrent straight to the river, shutting in the inmates of the houses on the east side of the Sandhill, and filling all their cellars. The pavement, too, between Printing Court Buildings and the Royal Assurance Buildings was raised up for two or three courses. Mr. Sutherland's bar ou the Sandhill was filled with water, and his cellars were inundated, a very large stock of ales being damaged and rendered unfit for use. Mr. Rogers' luncheon rooms adjoining were subjected to a similar visitation, the water mounting to an incredible height, aud causing great mischief to stock and fixings. At the foot of the Side, Mr. Irving, grocer, and Mr. Stearman, tobacconist, also had property destroyed by the downpour which got into their premises. The latter had several casks of tobacco damaged, together with pipes and other articles which were in stock. During the progress of the storm the Barrack Road was flooded, the water rushing down the middle of the causeway with terrible velocity. The cellars of many of the houses in Gallowgate were flooded, and the same was the case with many of those in Prudhoe Street. All along Percy Street there were collected deep and dangerous pools of water, but the most serious of these were those at the Haymarket and Barras Bridge. At the former place the road from the railings of St. Thomas's Churchyards, as well as the front of St. Mary's Place, was entirely under water, and the cab stand was also overflowed. The flood caused by the large quantity of water which ran down the hill from the Moor and col- b b"], [256, "218 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1872. lected in the hollow ground at Barras Bridge was very great indeed, completely covering the whole of the road and pathway, and ren dering all passage impossible till after the water had subsided. Several houses in this neighbourhood were flooded. The water rose to a height of fifteen inches in the bar of the Barras Bridge Hotel, Sandyford Lane, and many other houses near were also floooded more or less. At the east end of the town the thunder storm wrought damage of the most severe and serious character. Stock Bridge, lying at the foot of Manor Street, and approached from another high part of the town by Pandon Bank, presented the appearance of a perfect reservoir, being the receptacle for heavy floods which poured with great velocity down these two named thoroughfares. At the Burn Bank brewery another scene of deso lation was to be witnessed, a great portion of the flood from Pandon Bank and the Stock Bridge having found outlet along Pandon, it rushed down Burn Bank, in the direction of the Quay side, carrying with it doors and shutters which it had brought away from the shops upon Stock Bridge. The ale aud valuable hop cellars of the hop brewery were deluged in a very short space of time, and notwithstanding the immediate employment of twenty men whom the proprietor set to work to save some of the stock, all efforts were in vain, and the loss was extensive. The \" entries\" leading from the bottom of Gibson Street, on the New Road, to Sandgate were, as might be imagined from their extremely high gradient, in much the same plight. The storm broke over the sea port town and Tynemouth village with frightful violence. For twenty minutes the thunder and lightning were continuous and coincident ; there was scarcely an interval between the lightning and the thunder. The rain fell in sheets of water, and pieces of ice struck against windows, by which many panes were broken. About the time the thunder came on, a portion of the fleet of Scotch fishing boats were putting out to sea, but the fishermen were so appalled by the fury of the storm that most of the boats ran inside the South Pier for shelter. A herriiig fishing boat, named the Ten Brothers, of Eyemouth, was one of these. She was being brought alongside of another boat belonging to an aged fisherman named Atchison, of Eyemouth, when a flash of lightning struck the?boat's foremast, breaking it into splinters. It knocked three of the crew, who were forward, down. Peter Atchison, the master of the boat, was aft steering at the time, and the other man in the boat, Robert Cartney, was admidships. They escaped un injured. As soon as they could get the anchor down they ran to the help of their injured shipmates. John Atchison, brother of Robert, and son of the old fisherman we have named, a young man 26 years of age, with a wife and two children at Eyemouth, appeared to be dying. They got him forward to the bunk, when he exclaimed, \" God have mercy on me ; I'm nearly done ;\" and almost immedi ately afterwards expired. Assistance was rendered by the fisher men belonging to the fleet, and the boat was towed into the"], [257, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 219 harbour. Mr. aud Mrs. Stokoe, of the King's Head, North Shields, ai once took the two injured men and the dead body of the poor fellow who had been killed into their house, and the living men were immediately attended by the medical officers of the Tyne Ports Sanitary Station. One appeared to have been struck by lightning on the left arm and shoulder. His brain was also very much injured. There was a wound on one of his eyes, but whether from a blow from the fragments of the mast or the lightning was not clear. The poor old man Atchison had ten sons. One was lost on the Herd Sand, in the June gale, three years previous, and John had then a narrow escape from drowning. It is a remarkable and terrible coincidence that he had been spared three years to die from the effects of fire nearly upon the exact spot where his brother perished from water, and that in the presence of his aged father and several of his brothers. The lightning which killed poor Atcheson also destroyed the flagstaff at Tynemouth Castle. It likewise carried away two chimney-pots belonging to the residence of Canon Bewick, at Tynemouth. The rain flooded a number of cellars in the lower parts of North Shields. The lightning also struck several iron steamers and ships in the river, but it did not do any serious damage in that respect. June 23. \u2014 An inquest was held at the Durham Oxlnn, Newcastle, touching the death of Matthew Robinson, coal agent, who died from injuries caused by the explosion of a boiler in Messrs. Harrison's brickworks, at the Ouseburn, Newcastle-on-Tyne. The deceased appears to have been on a visit to his sister at Byker ; but having the misfortune to be crossing the Ouseburn viaduct at the time when the boiler exploded almost immediately beneath him, he was struck and severely injured by several of the flying missiles. He was at once conveyed to the Infirmary along with nine or ten other persons, and in this place, after scarcely ever rallying, he died. A verdict was returned as follows : \u2014 \" That the death of the said Matthew Robinson was caused by injuries in consequence of being struck in various parts us the body by bricks and other hard sub stances which were violently driven against him while passing along the Ouseburn Viaduct, in consequence of the explosion of a steam boiler at Messrs. Harrison's brick works, and the jury find that the strength of the boiler was so reduced that it was unfit for working under the required pressure.*' June 26. \u2014 The great sporting event of the year at the Newcastle upon-Tyne Race Meeting (the Northumberland Plate) came off to day, and was won by Mr. W. Henderson's Spennithorne (W. Gray), beating Don Carlos, Derwent, and seven others. The Gold Cup was won (on the following day) by Major Stapylton's Syrian, beating Miss Hervine and four others. June 27. \u2014 The pleasantly-situated village of Ryton, about six miles west of Newcastle, was visited by a large number of excur sionists fioin Newcastle and Gateshead, aud other towns in the"], [258, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 220 neighbourhood, as is usual on Race Thursday. Unfortunately, however, the pleasure of the holiday-makers was marred to a con siderable extent by a most lamentable occurrence. A young man was bathing in the river Tyne, near Ryton Station, when he was suddenly seized with cramp, and his struggles were witnessed by an immense concourse of excited spectators, one of whom, aged about 21 years, most courageously went to his rescue. As too frequently occurs in attempts to save life under similar circumstances, the attempted gallant rescuer himself met the fate he endeavoured to avert from a fellow-creature, for both the young men were drowned. An hour after the melancholy occurrence the bodies of the men were recovered, and conveyed to a public-house in the village. Their names were George Humphrey and Edward Bain ; they were both unmarried, were fitters by trade, and resided at Gateshead. Jidy 3. \u2014 A very sad accident, by which a young woman named Rosannah Docherty, 18 years of age, and a little girl named Elizabeth Fuller, eight years old, were drowned, occurred at Byker, near Newcastle. Docherty, who was an orphan, and lived with her aunt, Ann Kelly, in Byker Fold, was along with three children in a brick yard, and for the purpose of amusing themselves they were induced to get into a bogie, so that she might give them a ride along a gangway which crosses a pond, eight or ten feet deep in some places, the gangway being about four feet above the water. She had just commenced to wheel them along when her aunt, who had observed her from a distance, called out to her not to be so foolish. The young woman then sat down behind the children and said, \" Tell her I am not here.\" when, unfortunately, she over balanced the bogie, and they all fell over the gangway, the young woman and the child Fuller fell into the water, and the other two children on to some woodwork at the side. A large number of people were soon attracted to the spot, and great excitement pre vailed ; but, unfortunately, before any effort could be made to rescue the young woman and child, they were nearly gone. Two young men made a laudable attempt to save them, but were unsuccessful. Tney succeeded in reaching them aud bringing them on shore, and efforts were then made with a view to resuscitate them, but all the means used proved ineffectual. July 5. \u2014 This evening, about eight o'clock, five young men hired a small boat at Stockton Quay, for the purpose of rowing a short time up and down the Tees. When they reached the middle of the stream, one of the men was moving about, and the boat capsized. All hands were immediately after seen struggling in the water, and two were unfortunately drowned. July 6. \u2014 This evening, as a 'bus driver at Darlington, named Frank Thompson, was driving through the railway arch at Albert Hill, his head came in contact with a telegraph wire, which had expanded with the heat, and cut his throat in so fearful a manner as to j*au\u00bbe his death on the following evening."], [259, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 221 July 8. \u2014 A new banking firm called ihe industrial Bank (Limited) commenced business this day in the Arcade, Newcastle- on-Tyne. July 8. \u2014 The celebrated Claimant to the Tichborne estates ar rived in Newcastle this afternoon, and the event was marked by such a scene of excitement and confusion as is very seldom witnessed. When it was found that the Claimant was disposed to make a tour amongst his sympathisers, and that an adequate defence fund might in that way be organized, a very natural desire was manifested that the people of Newcastle and district should be included in the list of these favoured places. The immense accommodation of the Tyne Theatre was at once secured, and arrangements made for the holding of two monstre demonstrations at which the Claimant, backed by his friends, should be allowed every opportunity for fully explaining the position of the memorable case. Every new phase of the preparation was, of course, watched with the greatest interest, and hence, as the time approached for the arrival, a most astonishing amount of enthusiasm had been aroused amongst the people. So large was expected to be the throng, indeed, that the railway authorities were not a little concerned lest their ordinary business should be retarded. There was no admission to the interior, how ever, except to return ticket holders or intending travellers, and, as a consequence, the curiosity of the public could not be gratified without a pecuniary sacrifice being made of some kind. Many of the earliest arrivals were not slow to avail themselves of the excel lent sites afforded by the open windows and parapets ofthe portico, and, in the end, were amongst the favoured of the sightseers ; but still there were many hundreds who gained admission to the platform by means of tickets for short distance journeys. \" Thirds for Heaton,\" as well as for Gateshead and the Felling, were asked for on all hands, and no sooner were they issued than their fortun ate possessors rushed off to secure the best standage places which could be found in the interior of the station. They appropriated every seat overlooking the main line platform, and clung wiih the utmost tenacity to the iron palisading which constitutes the barrier to the same spot ; while an exceedingly large number ranged them selves on both sides of the gateway in such a manner as to form a long avenue to the porch. When all was thus expectation, and the crowd was momentarily increasing, the Tichborne Reception Com mittee entered the station, and as nearly all these gentlemen displayed magnificent flowers at their button-holes, and bore conspic uous white favours in their breasts, they were honoured with not a little attention from the spectators. Mr. R. H. Ireland, the local president, headed this deputation. Although every effort was made by the railway officials to keep the people in order, large numbers of them succeeded, in some strangely unaccountable way, in getting themselves smuggled from the outer to the inner platform, and thus rendered the position, in case of a crush, an extremely perilous one. So great was the inconvenience thus caused, indeed, that the station master urged the committee to get"], [260, "222 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. their guest off the premises as soon as ever they possibly could, and he remarked that he did so not merely for the purpose of facili- tating the business of the company, but for the better protection aud safety of the people themselves. The Claimant had some difficulty in getting out of his carriage, in consequence of the dis- graceful way in which the door was blockaded, several minutes elapsing before a descent to the platform could be safely made. Once on the ground, and there no longer seemed the slightest hope of further progress towards the exterior. The Claimant and his committee were alike beset by thousands of anxious spectators \u2014 \u25a0 many smarting under the disappointment of having jealously guarded advantageous positions, which now proved valueless \u2014 and hence they were jostled about in the most annoying and dangerous manner by the frantic crowd. Some of the people laughed at what they considered the sport ; others relieved themselves, and inspired the Claimant, by their sympathetic and encouraging cheers ; and others \u2014 and these by far the most numerous \u2014 inaugurated an idiotic system of leaping as high as they could in the air, in order to gain even the slightest aud most transitory glance of their visitor. While this mad spectacle was being enacted on the platform, and momentarily threatening to be attended with serious injuries to the weaker part of the throng, the standing \" Scotsman\" was literally overrun with sightseers. Men and boys were alike active in their feats of climbing, and, when once the carriage tops had been won, they were well repaid for all their trouble by the clear and uninterrupted view they obtained. For some time the strug- gling of the mass continued, and no apparent headway was made towards the porch ; but when the shrieks of women were painfully heard above the din, and it became evident that the Claimant's own physical conformation was not the most accommodating under pressure, the police, by au unusually determined charge, succeeded in forcing a passage on to the outer or general platform Here matters were, for a time, rendered worse thau ever, for a portion of the public had to be encuuntered \u2014 and that by no means an insignificant detachment \u2014 who had not previously possessed the slightest chance of seeing anything at all. Under these circum- stances, the squeezing aud crushing again became most intense, and in the midst of it, the massive cast-iron pillar, doing duty as a letter box, was sent with a terrible crash to the ground. Three or four women were borne down by this mishap, and it was at one time feared that fatal results would ensue; but thanks to the prompt action of the police, aided by several men in the crowd, they were raised to their feet almost before they were in the slightest degree trampled upon. From this point to the porch, and from thence across the portico, the pressure was scarcely ever relaxed ; and hence the Claimant, who was several times nearly overturned, might very well have been excused for wishing to be saved from his friends. The people, in fact, never left him for an instant, but cheered him, aud crushed iimi ,and trod on him during"], [261, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 223 the whole of his difficult, though triumphal, passage to the vehicle in waiting outside of the portico of the station. The committee had secured the services of an open carriage, drawn by a couple of rather drowsy-looking greys \u2014 and for some time this was so closely besieged by the people that one door was torn completely away from the hinges, and it seemed almost hopeless to attempt to bring it into requisition at all. By the free use of the whip, however, a passage to it was eventually secured, and the Claimant, looking terribly punished and jaded with his exertions, was then helped in safety to a seat, He was accompanied by Mr. G. H. Whalley, M.P. for Peterborough\u2014 who, at the last moment was said to have taken the place of Mr. Guildford Onslow, M.P. \u2014 and also by Mr. Ireland and several of his local supporters; but, owing to his immense weight, and the fact that the horses were themselves almost blocked in with people, it took a most diligent application of the driver's whip and patience before a start could be effected. Thousands of people were thickly packed in all parts of Neville Street ; while carts, waggons, cabs, and omnibusses, which completely intercepted the passage at the turn into West Grainger Street, were made the means of elevating many hundreds more. Still, in spite of this immense throng, the Claimant at last got clear, and he was then driven by way of Stephenson's Monu ment, Grainger Street, Market Street, and Pilgrim Street, to his quarters at the Queen's Head Hotel. The Claimant frequently lifted his hat in response to the cheers of the people who lined the thoroughfares, and his pleasant looks and gentlemanly manners were freely admitted on all sides. He alighted at the hotel in the midst of about two thousand persons, and was hurrahed for so long after he had gained the welcome shelter of the hotel, that he had to bow his acknowledgments from the balcony. This was the first occasion on which the public had had an opportunity of fairly seeing the immense size of their visitor, whose bulk, however, did not strike many of them as being so excessive as they had been led to suppose. Mr. Whalley also made his appearance, and was well received ; but as the crowd lingered and cheered after the party had left the windows, he subsequently reappeared for the purpose of expressing a few words of gratitude to them before they took their departure. At a later period of the evening, the Claimant was compelled to present himself once more to the populace, and he then said he thanked them most heartily for their sympathy. On the two following evenings the Claimant addressed large and enthusiastic audiences in the Tyne Theatre. July 10. \u2014 The foundation stone of a new Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was laid at Bensham, in the presence of about a thousand well-wishers ofthe edifice, by Mr. Aid. Brown, J. P., of Gateshead.

Brown. After devotional exercises had been gone through, Mr. Aid. Muschamp presented to Mr. Aid. Brown a handsome silver trowel wherewith to do the needful work of laying the stone upon that auspicious occasion. He adverted to the magnificent donations, amounting to \u00a31,500, which Mr. Brown had given them The inscription on the trowel was \u2014 \" Presented to Mr. Aid. Brown, J P., Claremont House, on the occasion of his laving the foundation stone of a new Wesleyan Chapel, Bensham, Gateshead, Wednesday, July 10, 1872.\"\u2014 Mr. Aid. Brown, in accepting the trowel, was much moved by the kindness exhibited towards him, and only wished some one else had been selected for his post that day. He owed all he had to Gates bead and the district, and he was therefore desirous of doing the place as much good as he possibly could before leaving the world. He then declared the stone duly laid, that fact being heralded at the same time by three lusty cheers given by the large assemblage. A collection was then taken, Mr. Brown heading it by a cheque for \u00a350, after which addresses were delivered by several of the ministers aud friends present. July 25. \u2014 Priuce Hassan, a member of the royal family of Egypt, paid a brief visit to Tyneside, for the purpose of inspecting the famous ordnance works of Sir Wm. Armstrong. He was attended by Mr. Larking, the agent of the Egyptian Government, as well as by two other gentlemen, aud seemed to pay the utmost attention to the various interesting objects pointed out to him. July 26. \u2014 At the Central Station Hotel, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Mr. Samuel Donkin, auctioneer, offered for public sale, in twelve lots, the residential estate known as Woodlands, with Broadwood, Sheepwalks, and several other farms, situated in the parish of Lanchestei , and county of Durham. There was a large attendance of gentlemen on the occasion. The estate, embracing upwards of 2,000 acres of pasture, arable, and woodland, was first offered in its entirety, but there being no bidders for the whole of the property, it was put up in lots. Lot 1, consisting of about 309 acres, together with dwelling-house, garden, orchard, farmstead, &c, was commenced at \u00a310,000, but the bidding ceased at \u00a312,200, and it was withdrawn. Lots 2 and 3 \u2014 the former the freehold residential estate known as Woodlands, consisting of 535 acres, and the other consisting of 66 acres, adjoining \u2014 were started at \u00a38,000, but were withdrawn when the bidding reached \u00a310,000.

July 31. \u2014 The Assembly Rooms in VVestgate Street, Newcastle, having undergone considerable alteration, repair, and decoration, were re opened by a grand public ball, the surplus arising from which being devoted to the restoration fund. By excavations the flooring of the supper room has been sunk quite three feet, the walls have been covered with rich gold paper, the ceiling has received great attention from the decorator, and the massive pillars have been painted with black and gold. There is now plenty of gas-light, as a bracket of three lights is secured to each pillar. The staircase leading to the upper rooms has also been skilfully treated, and along with all the rooms, excepting the two used for the dancing, is covered with beautifully soft carpet. The stair rails are painted black and gold, and the ceiling green, with small bright gold stars, and a handsome chandelier takes the place of the old-fashioned apparatus formerly used for holding wax candles. The two ante rooms, the ladies' cloak room, and the card room have all been similarly renovated, regardless of expense ; and all along the pas sage by the side of the large room pegs for hats and coats are placed, and these must remedy the inconvenience so ofteu expe rienced in one coat being tossed on the top of the other, and be coming so mixed up that getting your own was often a matter of the greatest difficulty. Brilliant, however, as are the decorations in other parts of the building, they all sink into oblivion before the magnificent appearance presented by the large dancing room. Here the contractors seem to have concentrated all their talent and skill, and the effect produced by the gilded ceiling, the seven large gas chandeliers, the representations of the Seasons, and the beau tifully-painted walls is gorgeous in the extreme, and is certainly one of the best specimens of decorative art to be met with in the north of England. Altogether, the decorations are of the most lavish and elaborate character, and bear a striking contrast to the former dingy appearance of the Assembly Rooms.

The property consisted of the Spindlestone and Whitton stall Estates, which were formerly part ofthe Derwentwater Estates, and were vested in the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the attainder of the last earl. A lady, calling herself \" Amelia, Countess of Derwentwater,\" bad, on several occasions, laid claim to this and other property ; and at the outset of the proceedings in connection with the sale, Mr. Aid. Laycock wished to know from the auctioneer if any guarantee could be given to the purchaser of the estate against future annoyance from the lady in question, and handed in a printed notice, beaded \" The sale of the manors of Whittonstall and Spindlestone, which are advertised for sale on the 6th inst., reported to be with the sanction of the Treasury Bench, are distinctly forbidden.\" The notice, which was dated the 2nd of August, 1872, addressed \" To the Right Hon. Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury,\" and signed \" Amelia, Countess of Derwent water,\" concluded as follows : \u2014 \" It is related, on reliable authority, that certain speculative jobbers in the House of Commons asked your lordships ' Whether you would prefer the entailed estates or the money they would bring ? ' If this is the case, it certainly savours of conspiracy, as your lordships could not have stopped to search the close enrolments of black letter law, to see whether you had exeoutive power before you gave your ' sanction ' to a sale so truly illegal. If jobbers are allowed to pass off jobbery for law, who is safe in the king dom ? These are the reasonings of the people : and should jobbery be resisted on the freehold estates, and the Queen's peace broken, it will be at your lordships' own peril. Then all England can look at our enrolled settle ment ; it is above al jobbery, aud absolute in all law usages.\" Mr. A. R. Bristow. solicitor to the Admiralty, in reply to Mr. Laycock, said this good lady fancied she was related to the old Earls of Derwentwater, and, as far as he knew, she might be ; but this country was a law-abiding country, and Acts of Parliament were difficult things to get over. Acts of Parliament specifically"], [265, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVEKTS. 227 stated that the property was forfeited to the Crown, handed over to the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital, and subsequently vested in the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty ; and he did not think that anything in the world could be so perfect a title as that. They could give no other guarantee than that the purchaser would have an undisputed right to the property. The bidding for the Spindlestone Estate commenced at \u00a390,000, and increased at the rate of \u00a3100 each offer up to \u00a3100,000, when it lay principally between Major Browne and Mr. Alderman Laycock, alternately advancing \u00a31,000. Ultimately, Major Browne, of Lesbury House, Alnwick, became the purchaser of the estate at \u00a3116,000. The Whittonstall Estate, the bidding for which commenced at \u00a360,000, was bought by Mr. Aid. Laycock for \u00a3,S0,000. Underlying the estates are coal, whinstone, ironstone, and other minerals.

The wedding party were conveyed to the church in nine carriages, and the roadsides along the route were lined with spectators. The old parish church, which was decorated for the occasion, was also crowded during the ceremony. September 4. \u2014 The Rev.

There was a contused wound upon one temple, and the right wrist appeared to have been dislocated ; and from these appearances it was concluded either that deceased had been the victim of some outrage, or that he had wandered within the rails protecting the cliff' and had accidentally fallen over at low water, and been thus drowned by the rising tide, as he lay stunned upon the rocks. Not a single coin, or any document likely to lead to his identity, was found on him. September 19. \u2014 The Lord Bishop of Durham attended at Dar lington to consecrate the new church of St. Paul's.

October 7. \u2014 A grand polytechnic exhibition was opened this day at Colliery Row, near Pence Houses, the proceeds of which were to liquidate the debt on the Wesleyan chapel at that place. The exhibition was replete with all that was wonderful and curious, and the variety was so great that visitors could not help but be deeply interested. There were collections of preserved birds and animals, fossils, entomological specimens, cabinets, curiosities from India and the Pacific Islands, gold nuggets from Australia, oil paintings, a cork model of a church with clock and chiming bells, models of machinery, an ingenious musical box, a telescope presented by the Queen to a miner formerly resident at Hetton, a capital model of the David Burn steamer, which was lost on its trial trip at the mouth of the Tyne, and a considerable number of other articles. The opening ceremony was performed by the Rev. Mr. Petch, the superintendent of the district, and the Rev. Mr. Rodgers, both of whom expressed a hope that the venture would prove as successful in a pecuniary point of view as it deserved. October 15. \u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales paid a visit to Chillingham Castle, where they were for several days the guests of the Earl of Tankerville. WTheu it was first mooted, persons in all parts began to arrange for a right royal welcome, and, therefore, on its being subsequently announced that their Royal Highnesses' appearance at Chillingham w.is only to be considered in the nature of a private visit, the expressions of regret were both general and sincere. Notwithstanding this great disappointment, however, the people determined to show their loyalty in every possible way, and to do all they could \u2014 consistent with the privacy which Lord Tankerville was so wishful to observe \u2014 to imbue the heir apparent's sojourn with becoming success. In the little village of Belford, for instance, the character of the decorations were extremely lavish, and in no place could the people have displayed a greater amount of unanimity and enthusiasm in carrying them out. Loads of heather found their way from the adjacent moors, and as these were supplemented with twigs of the dark fir, branches of the glistening laurel, and long trains of ivy, they wore fortunate in the manufacture of several pretty designs. The weather was gloriously bright and sunny \u2014 the nhite frost melting on the vegetation as it hung\u2014 and hence the willing workers entered upon their labours with an earnestness worthy ofthe auspicious event they were about to celebrate. The old-fashioned cress was speedily made to assume an appearance of the greatest gajety ; flags of almost every nation ality were unfurled from r early every house along the main thoroughfare ; while, as in the case of \" the town's best inn,\" the display was not unfrequently supplemented with the Wales' feathers, and the motto \" Ich Dien.\" The immense flag from Bamborough Castle had also been brought into use to sv* ell the"], [268, "Historical register of [a.d. 1872. 230 display, while across the road to Chillingham was a very tasteful and elaborately-arranged triumphal arch, on which were displayed a variety of suitable trophies. The grounds around Belford Hall were adorned with au equal amount of profuseuess, as also were several other prominent points along the entire route to the railway station. The preparations at this place were on a scale of even greater completeness, for a temporary passage-way had been con structed from the platform to the yard. Completely covering the sides and roof of this canopied structure was a graceful lining of light pink cloth, and along the entire floor as also upon a consider able portion of the platform, was spread a rich and warm-looking carpet of deep vermillion. Dainty evergreens, mingled with droop ing blooms of the fuschia and gladioli, were so arranged as to hide the exterior woodwork of the erection, and, as the effectiveness of these embellishments was increased by handsomegarlands of flowers, an appearance of great beauty was imparted to the whole place. As the time for the Prince's arrival approached the best positions in the vicinity of the station were secured by hundreds of anxious spectators ; and although a few of the most intensely loyal had stood to their post for hours, the fineness and geniality of the weather during the afternoon must have prevented their vigils from being in any way disagreeable. The Wooler, Chatton, and Belford companies of Earl Tankerville's battalion of Rifle Volunteers marched to the ground at about four o'clock, and were drawn up in line, under the command of Lieut. J. P. Purvis, immediately in front of the station. They were followed in due course by the carriages and visitors from the Castle, and as these were at once placed in the allotted order for the expected guests, it served as an intimation to the assembled crowd that their waiting was about to be rewarded. At twenty minutes past four a short train was seen to be coming quickly down the north line, and no sooner was she signalled to stop, and it was known that the Prince and Princess were approaching, than the battalion band, from Hexham, struck up the well-Known strains of \" Rule Britannia.\" On arriving they were met by the Earl of Tankerville and Lord Ossulston, and having cordially shaken hands with their genial host and his son, the royal party were attended to the carriages. They were recog nised by the expectant crowds as soon as ever they made their appearance at the outside of the station, and as the bands, at the termination of the National Anthem, struck up the beautiful air of \"God Bless the Prince of Wales,\" and the people began to testify their delight by loud and repeated huzzahs, the Prince and Princess could hardly fail to appreciate most highly this testimony of affection and goodwill. Their Royal Highnesses, who bowed their acknowledgments several times, then took their seats in an open brougham, which had been provided for their accommodation, and were, of course, joined by their noble entertainer The carriage was drawn by four beautiful greys, guided by postillions, and as it proceeded on its journey, its occupants were frequently cheered."], [269, "a.d. 1872.] remarkable events. 231 No sooner had they passed the river Till, and fairly entered upon Earl Tankerville's land, than they were joined by an escort consist ing of about 300 of his lordship's tenants and friends, and as the whole of these were mounted on animals which could hardly be equalled in any other district of the country, the spectacle was an exceedingly attractive one. The horsemen were headed by Mr. Jacob Wilson, as chief agent to Earl Tankerville, and was followed by Mr. Rea, of Middleton, and Mr. Alex. Borthwick, of Kilham, as the two largest holders on the estate. Shortly after being joined by this party, a most magnificently decked arch was reached. The columns were of marble, and the prevailing tints were the blue and white colours of his lordship ; but as these were further supple mented with the fringe of laurel leaves, and surmounted with a fine array of banners, t^e structure formed a very pleasing feature in a most attractive and varied landscape. A rapid drive along the highway brought the party to the entrance gates of Chilling ham, whence the route lay through a magnificent avenue of limes to the castle This portion of the way, although darkness had scarcely set in, was brilliantly illumined with scores of pedilla lights \u2014 as also were the battlements of the old castle itself \u2014 and this caused the termination of the journey to assume an aspect of great magnificence. The tenantry very prettily opened their ranks as the entrance to the court-yard was reached, and the Prince aud Princess, on alighting, were cordially received by the Countess of Tankerville, the hon. Misses Bennett, and Lady Skelmersdale. A beautifully ornamented awning was stretched over the whole length of the open court yard, and as the Royal visitors passed beneath its fringe of evergreen to their apartments, they were once more honoured with a cheer as only the most loyal yeomen in the county could give. The light along the avenue continued to burn for some hours, and an immense bonfire on Roscastle being lighted by the vil lagers, the whole district was illuminated until late in the evening. On the 17th, the most attractive feature in connection with the proceedings at Chillingham, consisted of the shooting of one of the famous wild cattle in the Earl of Tankerville's magnificent park. It had been understood that the Prince of Wales should, during his visit, have the honour of a shot at the king of the herd ; but owing to the difficulty of coming within reach of the animals when they were in any way excited, and to the danger which must have ensued to any large number of spectators, the exact time of the exploit was known only to comparatively few people. The fine park con sists of something like 1,300 acres of undulating and well-wooded land ; and of these there are no fewer than 900 acres over which the wild white cattle, the graceful fawns, and the nobly antlered red deer can roam at their own will. The herd is generally kept up to 11 bulls, 17 steers, and 32 females, or three scores in all. If it is fair weather they go up the hills, and if stormy they remain below. The necessary preparations having been made\u2014 his Royal Highness dismounted from his sturdy little hack, and quickly transferred"], [270, "232 historical register of [a.d. 1872. himself to a much snugger position beneath the batons of well strewed hay. Having been joined in this berth by Lord Tanker ville. they at once drove the vehicle in search of the customary grazing haunts of the cattle. It could not be much short of ten o'clock when the start was made, and as the lady visitors at the castle had by this time turned out, the earlier stages of the hunt were witnessed by them with the greatest clearness They occu pied a nicely sheltered eminence, immediately to the rear of the \" access gate,\" and ns the sun still shone with great splendour, and brought every varying tint of foliage most charmingly to view, they had a scene of great beauty and animation to contemplate during their self imposed vigils. Meanwhile the sporting party had pro ceeded for some distance iu search of the wild cattle, and, as had been anticipated, the hardy, agile, and noble creatures were speedily seen browsing beneath the golden-hued beeches on the Wood plain, and at no great distance from the meandering little stream. According to pre-arrangement, choice portions of hay were now strewn along the path, but, contrary to general expecta tion, the white herd did not display any astonishing alacrity to accept the invitation thus accorded them. As the vehicle con tinued to approach, however, the whole herd of sixty rose cautiously to their feet, and the bulls, with heads erect, at once backed into their comrades as a signal for a general retreat. They seemed to be extremely suspicious from the very moment they saw the cart approaching, and hence not one of them made a single step towards the food which was being proffered in such abundance. After glancing at the transgressors for a brief moment longer, the cattle moved briskly off to a side between the Elder Wood and My Lord's Plantation \u2014 two clumps in the centre of the ground \u2014 and seemed as though they were about to scamper away to the Fox Kuowles. As this would have prevented a good sight of the anticipated sport, the keeper very judiciously moved his cart away to the left \u2014 as though about to cross the burn in the direction of Sandy Banks \u2014 and the ruse had the effect of checking the dreaded stampede. After looking about them with great uncertainty for some minutes, most of the cattle again settled down in an open glade; but the other bulls, in contradiction of their asserted gallantry, did not feel themselves safe until they had retired for sixty or seventy yards higher up the hill, and left the majority of the cows and calves alone on the wood plain. These positions were maintained fora considerable period\u2014 the cart being also brought to a stand still as if the occupants were in a state of uncertainty as to their future movements ; but as three or four of the younger bulls now began to quarrel amongst themselves on the plain, the fracas caused not a little alteration in the positions of the respective herds. Their heads were tossed in fury, the ground was torn up by their mad pawing, and they butted each other with the greatest possible savageness. They flung themselves about so wildly, indeed, that about a score of the cows and calves made a still further move"], [271, "A.D. 1872 J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 233 towards the lower ground, and left their rough lords to settle their differences in their own peculiar fashion by themselves ; while the youngsters fought their way up the hill towards the other portion of the herd. The Prince is said to have been highly amused at the fractiousness which the animals displayed, and to have expressed his surprise that the fierceness of their tussle had not resulted in some rather serious injury to the combatants. Seeing no chance of openly approaching the king bull ou the hill, the Prince's cart again descended to the low ground, near the \"access gate,\" and thence, making a detour across the burn, again began to ascend under cover of the surrounding foliage. The parties were this time accompauied by the Prince's groom and pony ; aud after proceeding in a straight line past Taylor's Wood, they made a rightward turn to the outskirts of Robin Hood's Bog, in order to cut off the retreat of the bulls to the dizzy heights of Roscastle Hill. This attempt also was a failure, as the attention of the wary king was aroused by the cracking of dried twigs, and, consequently, smelling danger from these repeated interruptions, the herd dashed in grand style across the open space at the foot of Fox Knowles Wood, and were soon lost to view amid the density of the covering which was there spread over them. The cart again managed to get within easy shooting range ; but as the king bull was at this time right in the centre of the herd, it was impossible to get a clear shot at his noble head. Every movement was now closely watched by the Prince, the cart being moved in many ways with the hope of inducing the herd to scatter, and eventually these man\u0153uvres had the effect of inducing the king to leave his central position for a more com manding one at the head of the herd. When just about to renew his gallop for safety, however, he happened to shift his broadside in a line with the cart, aud this step was the last he ever made. The Prince, from his hiding place in the hay-covered vehicle, was quick to perceive this opportunity which the bull had given him, and, therefore, bringing his rifle with great alacrity to the rest, he sent the bullet right through the neck of his long-coveted prey. The noble animal gave one furious snort, bounded several paces forwards, and then fell dead to the ground. A more dexterous shot could not have been made \u2014 the missile entering six inches from the base of the horn, and severing the spinal cord \u2014 while a finer sample of an ox could not possibly have been found in the country. The Prince, who was 70 yards off when he fired, was greatly complimented on the success which had attended his first shot ; and afterwards, while the remainder of the cattle were scam pering at a furious pace over the hills, he went and inspected the fine proportions of this famous hero of the Chillingham herd. Animals of all kinds were startled by the rifle shot and the rush of the escaping animals, while the appearance of a couple of antlered red deer on the very topmost ridge of Roscastle formed not the least pleasing feature of the scene which the magnificent park pre sented. The Prince went out pheasant shooting at a later period Dd"], [272, "234 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1872. of the day, and enjoyed very capital sport in the neighbourhood of Trickley Woods, Howmoor. and Fowberry. A display of fireworks took place in front of the castle in the evening, and was witnessed by hundreds of the country people from the adjacent villages. The variety of brilliant colours revealed in the discharges ofthe rockets was greatly admired; while thebeauty and appropriateness ofthe set piece, \" Welcome to Northumberland,\" and \" God bless the Prince and Princess,\" elicited the warmest approval of the spectators. A meeting of foxhounds took place next day at the noble residence of Earl Tankerville, at Chillingham, and was unquestionably one of the grandest and most imposing spectacles that had ever taken place in the hunting annals of Northumberland. It was an assem blage well worthy the occasion . which had called it forth. Every arrangement that was at all likely to conduce to the Prince of Wales's pleasure, or to the complete enjoyment of the exciting pastime, appeared to have been made by the energetic gentlemen who had organized the gathering on Lord Tankerville's behalf. In no way was this more observable than in the quality of the dogs selected for the cross-country cut after poor Reynard, and in the speed and stamina of the many noted horses that had been secured for the merry chase behind them. The \" meet'' was announced to take place in front of the castle at about half-past ten o'clock, but long before that hour the locality resounded with the merry rum bling of approaching wheels, and the still more enjoyable clatter of the horsemen. The weather was by no means favourable for the display, as dull, leaden-coloured clouds were banked up formidably in all parts of the sky, and more than once showed indications of completely spoiling the anticipated sport. This threatening aspect of the morning was no doubt the means of keeping many timid people from the grounds ; but still, notwithstanding the risk of a drenching rain, there was such a constant succession of arrivals from Belford, Alnwick, Wooler, and the whole of the villages throughout Glendale, that the total numbers present could not fairly be estimated at less than several thousands. Some trudged the dirty roads in the gayest of costume, though carefully armed with shawls and umbrellas, while the vehicles varied in size and beauty from the miserable little one horse chaise to the splendidly crested four-in-hand drag. The scene presented during their continuous entry to the park was one of more than usual animation. AU the approaches were densely thronged \u2014 especially the route lying through the lime avenue \u2014 and hence the long strings of gay carriages, the scarlet-coated huntsmen, and the hordes of spectators were not unfrequently brought into rather unpleasant contact. They all contrived, however, to reach the appointed place without any accident of a serious nature, and displayed the greatest willingness to occupy the respective positions which had been set apart for them by Earl Tankerville's own orders. The particular site selected for the \" meet\" was at a point opposite the south front of the hall \u2014 immediately contiguous to the splendidly-rolled"], [273, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 235 lawn \u2014 and in full view of the distinguished party who occupied the windows. No sooner did the visitors arrive on the confines of this spot, no matter whether in vehicles or on foot, than they were arranged in such a way as to form a monstre semicircle round the front of the old building, and in positions from which every one could command a clear and uninterrupted view of whatever might take place on the lawn. The management of this part of the pro gramme was admirable in the extreme \u2014 the persons on foot being placed in the face of the ring ; the horsemen standing prominently behind them ; and the carriages closing in the whole ofthe view to the rear. So great was the popular desire to witness the \" meet,'' indeed, that a very large concourse of people had been brought together by the time appointed for the assembly, and stood in a magnificent line right round the enclosure. No fewer than 4,000 or 6,000 foot passengers would be on the ground, and these, backed by 200 or 300 vehicles, and from 1,000 to 1,200 horsemen, formed an array of such brilliancy and magnitude as it is not frequently the good fortune of the Northumbrians to witness. While the expectant onlookers and sportsmen were thus waiting for a start, the gallant pack of Major Browne was led prominently forward to the lawn, and were there the observed of all observers. The splen did hounds were active in their movements, their beautiful skins were clean and glossy, and they seemed in all respects in the very pink of condition. The movements of the dogs were closely watched as they roamed about the lawn \u2014 the three horses not un frequently prancing about with them\u2014 and, therefore, as the sun had by this time broken boldly from out the cloudland, and the ivy-covered facade of the castle was made to glisten in its light, the prospect revealed to the spectators was of the most charming and tasteful description. While all was thus expectancy on the part of the ladies, and the auxious horsemen were beginning to gallop about to the rear of the semicircle, the attention of the throng was once more diverted by the sudden approach of several of the castle visitors to the lawn. Almost immediately afterwards, and before the horsemen could well resume their positions, a cheer announced that the Prince of Wales and his distinguished followers were at length preparing for the field. His Royal Highness was mounted on a slashing dark chesnut, with a white' face; but, owing to his intention not to proceed with the chase for any great distance, he had abandoned the usual hunting costume for a more unpretending suit of light grey*. He was very heartily cheered by all who recognized him, and had more than once to bow his acknow ledgments for the warmth of the reception accorded. Genial and acceptable as this outburst must have proved, it paled into com parative insignificence before the immense ovation which was given to the Princess. She was dressed in a dark-coloured morning costume, and, along with the Countess of Tankerville, took her seat in a handsome little phaeton, drawn by two well-conditioned bays. Her Royal Highness was in possession of the reins, aud was ruptu-"], [274, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 236 rously cheered as she moved from the porch. The immediate spot selected for the throw-off was at a point midway between the Ros castle and the Hepburn Wood, and as the hounds had already been sent forward in readiness, the huntsmen were not long in following on their track. The carriage of the Princess was first conducted through a gateway to the home park, and was thence sent rapidly towards a little rising ground near Hepburn Farm, from which a good view of the woods and adjacent lands could be obtained. His Royal Highness, however, set spurs to his handsome hunter, and closely attended by the noblemen of the party, went at a brisk gallop after the hounds. After many misfortunes, a leash of foxes was discovered in Eglingham Wrood, and one of them having been brought out, a most exciting chase was witnessed for three-quarters of an hour ; when Reynard, tired out, succumbed to his pursuers. The brush, one of the most handsome ever seen, was handed over by Major Browne to Lord Ossulston, to be by him presented to the Princess of Wales. The royal visit to Chillingham was terminated in the evening, amid similar indications of goodwill to those that had marked their advent. The court-yard, the battlements, and the avenue of lime trees were brilliantly illuminated with pedella lights ; while the triumphal arch at the Till Bridge had been redecked with the words, \" Will ye no come back again 1\" They were lustily cheered by the Tankerville tenantry on moving from the gates, and were similarly greeted on their passage through Chatton ; while in the route past the nicely-lighted village of Bel ford, and at the railway station, the hearty greetings of the popu lace showed that their enthusiasm was still undiminished. The Royal party left Belford for the south by the ordinary mail at 9*28, and were cheered again and again as they steamed from the platform. October 18. \u2014 The occasion of the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to the North seemed to the Mayor of Newcastle-on-Tyne to present a fitting opportunity for the town officially to assure their Royal Highnesses of its unchecked loyalty and devotion to the Crown. His Worship accordingly asked the Town Council to allow him to convey to the Prince and Princess their expressions of welcome and goodwill through the medium of an address, and a unanimous approval of the proposal having been given, his Worship communicated with the equerry-in-waitiug to learn the pleasure of his Royal Highness on the matter. The Prince cheerfully signified his readiness to accept this manifestation of the loyal feeling of the people of Newcastle, but intimated his desire that the presentation might be of a private character, as being more convenient for his Royal Consort and himself. Two addresses were at once prepared for presentation \u2014 one of which was addressed to the Prince, and the other to her Royal Highness the Princess. The request of the Prince as to privacy, however, proved to be too difficult a one to be complied with ;and however great the efforts of the authorities weie iv admit onJy special ticket-holders to the platform of the"], [275, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 237 Central Station, the crowd of anxious and euchusiastic onlookers somehow increased to a couple of thousands before the time fixed for the arrival for the mail train by which their Royal Highnesses travelled. It had been previously announced that the proceedings would be divested of everything having the semblance of ceremony, and that the duty of the Mayor would be one of the purest for mality. Eight minutes past eleven was the time at which the mail was due to reach Newcastle, but long before that hour arrived the approaches to the station were thronged, and a keen desire pre vailed to make good an entrance within the doors, which were apparently most efficiently guarded. The ticket-holders had diffi culty in forcing their way into the station, but by half-past ten some hundreds of persons must have contrived to reach the pre cincts of the main platform. The throng went on increasing, though in what manner so many hundreds of persons more than held tickets received an entrance remained a mystery. It soon became evident that great confusion would prevail when the train arrived if the platform was not somewhat cleared, and the police authorities, supported by the suasive eloquence of the Sheriff, en deavoured to press back the crowd towards the iron railings. Many ofthe ladies were subject to great incovenience and rough treat ment, and one or two scenes took place which showed not only the absurdity but the impropriety of divided authority ou such an occasion. Thus matters stood when the Prince and Princess arrived at twenty-two minutes past eleven. A faint cheer was heard at first from the people at the distant extremity of the plat form, but it gathered strength and intensity as the two engines drew up the train towards the centre of the station. Ringing cheers then resounded through the building, but the impetuosity of the crowd was not for a moment to be restrained. A general rush was made from all directions upon the state carriage in which the Prince and Princess were journeying, and before its motion was ceased it was densely surrounded by hundreds of warm-hearted and demonstrative people, who poured forth their welcome in hearty huzzas, accompanied by waving of hats aud handkerchiefs. The Mayor and the Sheriff, who had been duly posted, attended by the mace and sword-bearers, ready to place the addresses in the hands of the royal visitors, were almost overwhelmed by the pressure behind them, and their functions were discharged with great dis comfort and considerable personal risk. Their Royal Highnesses acknowledged the welcome by which were greeted, and the Prince shook both the Mayor aud the Sheriff cordially by the hand. The addresses were then presented, and the Prince assured the Mayor of his pleasure at receiving such a manifestation of the goodwill of the people of Newcastle, and of his intention to forward a reply from Marlborough House. During these few moments the cheer ing was continued unabated, and every stratagem that could be devised was resorted to in order to secured a glimpse of the occu- pants of the state carriage. The Prince and P rincess stood at"], [276, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a D. 1872. 238 the open door of the carriage during the whole period it remained at the platform, and were apparently most gratified at the hearti ness of their recpption. They again and again acknowledged the greetings which were being so profusely and spontaneously offered to them, aud their Royal Highnesses would long remember their reception at the Central Station, as being characterised by such a genuine display of loyalty and affection as they were perhaps hardly prepared to witness. The following is the text of the addresses which were presented to their Royal Highnesses, and which had been very elaborately engrossed on vellum and illumi nated : \u2014 \" To His Eoyal Highness Albert Edward Prince of Wales. \"We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Newcastle upon-Tyne, approach your Royal Highness with the expression of our un feigned attachment to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, and our deep sense of the great and manifold blessings which have been enjoyed by all classes of our countrymen under her wise and beneficent reign '\u25a0 Under the guidance of Her Most Gracious Majesty, the civil and reli gious liberties of her people have been preserved, freedom has been main tained, th\" advancement and prosperity of England have been promoted, and the whole country prays with deep and earnest loyalty that peace, tran quility, and happiness may continue to attend her reign. \" We offer to your Eoyal Highness a hearty welcome to our ancient Borough, and the expression of our heartfelt gratification that it is in re newed health and vigour that you have honoured us with your royal pre sence. \" Firmly united in loyal attachment to her Majesty, we feel the deepest interest in the welfare and happiness of every member of the Royal Family.

Palmer and Co.'s iron shipbuild ing establishment, Jarrow, by which two men lost their lives. Two labourers, named George Cram and John McKean, were engaged in assisting some fitters in repairing a steam hammer used in the works, and, as the work was urgent, the men were working through the night. Between one and two o'clock, the two labourers, not likely to be wanted by the fitters for an hour or so, retired into a cabin, and made a fire for the purpose of warming themselves. There was no chimney in the cabin, but there was a window space, which, however, when the men went in was closed by means of a tightly-fitting shutter. There was consequently no means of venti lation The unfortunate men made the fire in an open grate stand ing on the floor, and, having kindled up the fire, they fastened them selves in by locking the door from the inside, and lay down in front of the burning fire to rest themselves until they were wanted by the fitters. About two o'clock, the men were missed by their comrades, but as they were not particularly wanted nothing was thought of their absence. About seven o'clock in the morning, the foreman wanting some material out of the store-room, proceeded thither, and found the door locked, with the key on the inside. After knocking for some time to attract the attention of those he thought were inside, he suspected something unusual had hap pened, and forced the door open ; and on entering he was horrified to find the bodies of the two men lying on the floor in front of the embers of the fire. The men were quite dead, having apparently been so for some time.

The contemplated gathering was very extensively made known through the surround- ing district, and, as a consequence, an immense number of Irishmen assembled to testify their sympathy with the objects sought to be attained by the promoters. They came in thousands from all parts of Tyneside \u2014 Sunderland, Consett, Middlesborough, and other distant towns \u2014 and as a large majority of them wore green ribbons, sashes, and scarves, their appearance was exceedingly attractive.

He was created Baron Brancepeth of Brancepeth about four years prior to his death, but he still held by his more ancient title of Lord Boyne. As a politician his lordship was Conservative, but he rarely took an active part in politics, but devoted himself more to the pursuits of a country gentleman, his time being principally spent at his residences in Shropshire or in Durham, and less fre quently at his town residence, 22, Belgrave Square, London. Lady Boyne expired at Brancepeth Castle, in May, 1870, and since that time his lordship had spent longer periods of his residence in the north at Brancepeth Castle. As a landlord, the deceased was a kind and just friend to all his tenantry, and to those employed about his estate, while his means were ever ready in support of charity, nothing deserving of a helping hand ever appealing to him in vain. The deceased peer was succeeded to his estates by the Hon. Gustavus Russell Hamilton Russell, who was in the 41st year of his age. October 31. \u2014 The foundation-stone of a new Fever and Small pox Hospital was laid at Darlington by the Mayor (Mr. Ianson). October 31 . \u2014 This evening, the Mayor of Newcastle (Mr. Aid. T. L. Gregson) gave a grand ball in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle on-Tyne, to the inhabitants of the town aud neighbourhood, and the gathering was without doubt one of the most brilliantly suc cessful of the kind ever attempted by any other magistrate or private individual in the borough. Mr. Gregson was first elected to the Council as the representative of St. John's Ward, on the 1st of November, 1353, and for the long period of 19 years he, with unremitting attention and zeal, endeavoured to promote the welfare of the inhabitants and the prosperty of Newcastle. Recognising his ability in the discharge of the duties he was called upon to perform, and in appreciation of his independent course of action as a gentleman, his colleagues in the Council conferred upon him the highest honour it was in their power to grant by making him Mayor ofthe borough with the interests of which he hadso closely identified himself. A further mark of distinction was, however, yet in store for him, and on the death of Mr. Aid. Blackwell, he was elevated to the aldermanic bench. During Mr. Gregson's mayoralty a few important incidents occurred, and upon these occasions the choice of the Council was shown to have been judicious and right. In all"], [279, "A.D. 1872.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 241 the important duties of the office the Mayor was, when occasion required, ably supported by Miss Bell, his niece, as Mayoress, and they won for themselves in the discharge of those duties golden opinions from all classes of the community. His Worship con sidered it an appropriate mode of commemorating his mayoralty by giving the ball, and if any further proof was required of the public appreciation of his efforts during his mayoralty, it was certainly forthcoming by the eagerness with which the invitations to partici pate in the festivities were accepted * and, moreover, those who could not attend invariably wrote to the Mayor and Mayoress in forming them that such result was brought about through unforeseen circumstances, or they would have had pleasure in partaking of the hospitaLty so graciously offered. November 9. \u2014 The annual election of Mayors for the boroughs of Northumberland and Durham took place with the following results : \u2014 Newcastle, Richard Cail, Esq., Mayor, W. S. Daglish, Esq., Sheriff; Gateshead, Mr. Aid. Muschamp, ; Tynemouth, C. A. Adamson Esq. (re-elected) ; South Shields, Mr. Aid. Glover ; Sun derland, A. McKenzie, Esq. ; Durham, Mr. Aid. Fowler ; Stockton, George Lockwood, Esq. (re-elected) ; Hartlepool, Robert Brewis, Esq ; Morpeth, Francis Brummell, Esq. ; Darlington, Mr. Aid. Luck. November 18. \u2014 Mr. Henry C. Briggs, of Saltburn, laid the corner stone of a new Unitarian chapel, in Wellington Street, Stockton. The chapel is 60 feet long by 38 feet broad. There is sitting accommodation in open pews for 300 persons. The style of archi tecture is early Gothic. Behind the chapel there is a school 47 feet long and 24 feet broad. The total cost of the buildings, including all furnishings and the land, was about \u00a33,000. November 25. \u2014 Died, at St. Leonards, in his 68th year, the Marquis of Londonderry. The marchioness was present with him at his dissolution. The relatives of his lordship were not unpre- pared for his death, for he had lingered several weeks without any hope of recovery. Frederick William Robert Stewart, Marquis and Earl of Londonderry, Viscount Castlereagh, county Down, and Baron of Londonderry, in the peerage of Ireland, also Baron Stewart, of Stewart's Court and Ballylawn, county Donegal, in the peerage of the United Kingdom, was the only son of Charles William, third Marquis of Londonderry, K.G., G.C.B., by his first wife, Lady Catherine Bligh, fourth daughter of John, third Earl of Darnley. He was born 7th July, 1805, and succeeded to the marquisate and other family honours in March, 1854. His lordship had married, 30th April, 1846, Elizabeth Frances Charlotte, widow of Viscount Powerscourt, and eldest daughter of the Earl of Roden. The mar quis, soon after he came of age, was returned to the House of Commons as member for the county Down, and retained his seat in the Commons until the death of his father. He was a Junior Lord of the Admiralty in 1828, and afterwards Vice-Chamberlain to b e"], [280, "HISTORICAL KEGTSTER OF [a.D. 1872. 242 William IV. in 1834. While in the House of Commons in his early parliamentary career he adopted thorough Conservative views, but subsequently he was one of the most zealous supporters of Viscount Palmerston. His lordship was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of the county Down in 1845, a responsible position he was com pelled by mental malady to relinquish in 1864. He was succeeded in the marquisate and other honours by his half-brother, George Henry R. C. W. Vane-Tempest, Earl Vane. November 30. \u2014 This morning, a frightful accident occurred at Morpeth Railway Station to a young woman named Jane Wilson, belonging to Acton. She was going to be married at Morpeth, and whilst the train was passing along by the side of the platform at the station, one of the bridal party opened the carriage door and got safely out. She then attempted to do the same, but unfortu nately was thrown down between the train and the platform and was very seriously crushed. On being picked up she was carried into the station, where she was attended to. In the afternoon she was brought to the Newcastle Infirmary, where, on examination, it was found that she had sustained a large scalp wound and a very serious injury to her s\"pine. She died from the effects of her injuries on the 20th December following. December 6. \u2014 This morning, a destructive fire broke out in a steam ship-biscuit manufactory belonging to Mr. Aid. Wasooe, in Clive Street, North Shields. It was discovered by the policeman on the beat, and the fire-brigade was soon on the spot with the hose and engine. The manufactory was situated on a quay abutting in the street, and notwithstanding the brigade, with the help of civi lians, attempting to get it within control, they could not do so, and the manufactory with its contents was reduced to ruins. Mr. Wascoe had got in 50 sacks of flour ou the previous day, and they, with the stock of biscuits, were burnt along with the factory. The neighbourhood where the fire occurred was densely populated, and the progress of the fire was watched with great alarm by the people, but by the diligence of the fire-brigade the fire was kept within the premises wherein it was first discovered. A good deal of damage was done, however, by the water to the adjacent premises. December 7. \u2014 At an early hour this morning Mr Routledge, a town missionary at Sunderland, died from a fit of apoplexy, in the 70th year of his age, at his residence in Garden Place. Deceased was a native of Rookhope, in Weardale, and went to Sunderland as clerk, where he remained for about nine years, and then left to take the appointment of town missionary, to which field of labour he was introduced by Mr. John Halcro. He was, from a very early age, connected with the Wesleyan body, and continued his association with the Methodists in Sunderland, as a class leader and local preacher, having acted as class leader for over half a century. He took an active interest in Mr. Backhouse's Home or Reformatory for fallen females, and was generally entrusted with the distribution"], [281, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 243 of charitable gifts to the families of the poor. His latest energies were devoted to the collection of over \u00a3500 for the building of a mission chapel in James Williams's Street, and he lived to see the new place almost ready for opening. December 13.* \u2014 A grand full dress Masonic ball was held at the Central Hall, Darlington, under distinguished patronage, including the most noble the Marquis of Ripon, K.G., M.W. Grand Master of England ; the Right Hon. the Earl of Carnarvon, M.W. Deputy Grand Master of England ; the Right Hon. the Earl of Zetland, K T., &c, M.W. Past Grand Master of England ; the Right Hon. the Earl Percy, M.P., Past Senior Grand Warden of England, and Provincial Grand Master of Northumberland. About one hundred couples were present, and a large party from Chilton Hall, the seat of Lord Ernest Vane Tempest. The hall had been beautifully decorated for the occasion. Robert Hudson, Esq., Grand Director of Ceremonies for the Province of Durham, officiated as Master of the Ceremonies, and the ball was a splendid success, all the arrange ments having been admirably planned and carried out. December 11. \u2014 A beautiful testimonial, in the shape of a valuable telescope, enclosed in a mahogany box, was presented to a West Hartlepool Captain by the Emperor of Prussia, bearing the following inscription : \u2014 \" We, William, by the grace of God permitting, Emperor of Germany, King of Prussia, present this to Captain T. D. Turner, of the steamer May, of West Hartlepool, as an acknow ledgment for the effective deliverance from the perishing of the crew ofthe Bebe, of Stettin, on the 6th of August, 1872.\" December 17.\u2014 Joseph Banter, one of ihe crew of the schooner Friendship, of Hartlepool, was presented with a handsome silver medal, of the second class, together with a parchment diploma from the French Government for his bravery in having, whilst the Friend ship lay at Calais, on the 17th November, 1871, rendered distin guished service. December 24.\u2014 A very influential and numerously attended meeting of shipowners, coalowners, and others connected with the commerce of the Tyne was held in the Mayor's Chamber, Guildhall, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for the purpose of organising measures to relieve the distress arising from the appalling loss of life at sea, and to endeavour to establish a Permanent Mariners' Widows' and Orphans' Fund. The Mayor of Newcastle (Mr. Richard Cail) pre sided, and letters were read from Sir Wm. Armstrong, Mr. I. L Bell, Archdeacon Bland, and Mr. John Straker, expressing their concur rence with the objects of the meeting, and promising very substantial support towards the accomplishment of the proposal. December 24.\u2014 The will of Viscount Boyne, of Brancepeth Castle County of Durham, was sworn under \u00a370,000. The testator bequeathed to Mrs Sarah White an annuity of \u00a3200, and to her daughter, Emily Alexandra, a legacy of \u00a31,500 ; to his valet, an"], [282, "244 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1873. annuity of \u00a350 j to Mr. John Parrington, a legacy of \u00a31,000 ; and to Mr. George Arnold Litchfield one of \u00a32,000. The testator directed that the plate, jewels, and furniture of Brancepeth Castle, Durham, and at Burwarton Hall, Salop, and also the plate and jewels at his bankers, should he deemed heirlooms, and be enjoyed by the person for the time being entitled to such estates. The residue of his personal estate testator gave to his son. 1873 (January 3). \u2014 An exciting scene occurred in the River Wear, near Willington. Mr. Wilson, a butcher, of High Street, Spennymoor, had been at Willington and the neighbourhood with his cart, carrying meat to his customers, and their being no bridge across this part of the river, he was attempting to cross the ford at Page Bank, but had no sooner entered the river, than, in consequence of the current running so strong, the pony was taken off its feet and the cart upset, and the pony, cart, and Mr. Wilson were car ried rapidly away by the stream. A number of persons gathered on each side of the river, and a rope was thrown to Mr. Wilson, but without avail, and he was washed a considerable distance down the river, when, fortunately, he caught hold of some willows, and was able to hold on until some persons joined hands and rescued him in a very much exhausted state. The pony was drowned, and, with the cart, was carried away with the stream. January 4. \u2014 This morning, an alarming and destructive fire broke out on the premises of Messrs. R. J. J. Mays and Son, wholesale and retail chemists and druggists, &c, Market Place, South Shields, and before it was extinguished damage to the extent of two or three thousand pounds was done to the stock and adjoining premises. January 7. \u2014 The Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle, formally opened a very attractive bazaar in the Town Hall, Gateshead, the object of which was to raise a fund for the purpose of providing an organ for St. Cuthbert's Church, Bensham. January 13. \u2014 Hugh Slane and John Hayes, two men convicted at the Durham Assizes, of the wilful murder of Joseph Waine, at Spennymoor, were executed this morning within the walls of Dur- ham Goal. Four prisoners were at first condemned to death for being implicated in the terrible crime * the day on which they should be brought to the scaffold was appointed, and for some time it seemed probable that four lives would be sacrificed in expiation of one man. Such a melancholy issue to the awful tragedy, did not, however, take place for some three days before the period of grace alloted for preparation for appearing before a more dread tribunal expired, the Home Secretary communicated to the prison authorities his determination to respite two of the unhappy men \u2014 Terence Rice and George Beesley \u2014 pending the further considera tion of their case. January 13. \u2014 The will of the Righ Hon. Frederick William Robert, Marquis of Londonderry, K.B., was proved on the 10th"], [283, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 245 inst., by his widow, under \u00a380,000. He devised to his widow \u00a3^,000 per annum out of his estates in the county of Down, \u00a3500 per annum out of his estates in Londonderry and the county of Donegal, and appointed her residuary legatee. January 21. \u2014 The ceremony of opening a most imposing and spacious chapel, erected by the Wesleyan community of West Hart lepool, took place this day. The new edifice is commandingly situated at the top of Church Street, immediately joining the Cam bridge and Hart Roads. The style of architecture is Corinthian, and the chapel is capable of accommodating fully 1,250 persons. Under the chapel is a school-room 53-^ by 45 feet, 12 feet 6 inches in height. The inaugural service was attended by a crowded and influential congregation, the legal form of registration being read by the Rev. J. Russell, superintendent of Hartlepool circuit. January 23. \u2014 At an early hour this morning a fire was disco vered to be raging violently at the wire rope manufactory, timber yard, and saw mills of Messrs. Haggie Brothers, South Shore, Gateshead. Crowds of people soon flocked to the scene of the con flagration, the aspect of which, from a near point of view, was very impressive. How the fire originated could not be ascertained, but it was first discovered by the night watchman in the rope works. The red and white flame, with imposing effect, shot high into the air, casting for miles around the district a brilliant flood of light, revealing to view in the distance the most infinitesimal objects ; while the tall spires of St. Nicholas, with its gorgeous lantern tower, All Saints, St. Ann's, and other churches, together with the principal buildings near at hand, wTere seen to great advantage under the extraordinary circumstances. A copious supply of water was obtained from the road which runs past the works, and the Gateshead officers, with their engine, were busily engaged pouring unceasingly and vigorously jets of water into the burning building. The fire was of such magnitude, and the case one of such great urgency, that the steam fire engine was despatched for, and it soon arrived with full steam up. A ship lying moored in the riyer had a very narrow escape, and only got out of harms way after her side had taken fire. Before the fire was got under the whole buildings were reduced to a complete ruin. February 2. \u2014 A party of five young men, belonging to Spenny moor, Durham, were returning from a pleasure excursion at Crook when the horse suddenly took fright, and ran with great impe tuosity towards Bishop Auckland. Four who were inside the vehicle leaped out, and escaped. The fifth, a young man named Kiplin, who was riding beside the driver, endeavoured to emulate the example of his comrades, and in doing so, was throw violently on to his head, and killed. The driver pulled with all his might when, turning on to a bridge, the conveyance came in contact with a wall, and he was thrown over the parapet. He managed to keep a firm hold of the reins, hung for some moments as it were"], [284, "246 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. between life and death, when the horse, which had kept its feet \u2014 though the shafts of the vehicle were smashed to atoms \u2014 pulled with his head, and dragged the man from his perilous position very little worse. February 3 \u2014 A fire, which threatened destruction to a large amount of property, occurred this evening in a portion of Henry Milvain and Son's canvas manufactory, Gateshead. By dint of great exertion on the part of the firemen, the devastating element was confined to the drying house, which was totally consumed ; the other portions of the building, beyond a slight scorching, being little the worse. February 4.\u2014 A handsome new church, erected for the Congrega tionalists of Gateshead, on an excellent site near the Hexham Road, was opened for public worship in the presence of a large and respect able congregation. The building, which is of stone with ashlar dressings, is constructed fiom a very beautiful Gothic design, and with its neat spire rising to a height of 113 feet, aud its commanding position above the Windmill Hills, it forms a pleasing and prominent addition to the architectural embellishments of the borough. The interior is also extremely elegant \u2014 every part of the work being finished vith great care and skill \u2014 and hence the place is well adapted to the purpose for which it is to be applied. The sittings, including those in the gallery, are arranged to accommodate 800 persons, and the platform pulpit is so situated as to allow the preacher to be seen by all, as well as to see all, the worshippers to whom he may happen to be ministering Altogether the edifice is spacious and elegant, the windows being large and tasteful. February 4. \u2014 The friends of Mr. C. H. Cameron, who was accused of decoying a liitle girl from Gateshead, but was discharged by the magistrates, met at the Freemasons' Hall, West Street, Gateshead, this evenins*, to present to that gentleman a testimonial, consisting of a handsome gold vatch, albert, and seal, together with a purse of gold, as a mark of esteem and appreciation of his many good quab ties. Mr Pattison narrated how the testimonial had originated, and concluded by stating that they had finally resolved to present Mr. Cameron with a gold watch, which had cost nearly \u00a325, and, in addition to that, a purse containing thirty sovereigns. He then read a letter from the employers of Mr. Cameron, to the effect that they were much pleased with the strong expression of sympathy that had been shown towards their foreman, Mr. Cameron, who had suffered so much from an unfounded accusation, and they begged to enclose a cheque of \u00a310 as their contribution. The Chairman observed that it was needless for him to recapitulate any of the circumstances of the unfortunate affair, inasmuch as they were all privy to the facts as well as himself. He would remark, however, that Mr. Cameron came out oft! e trying ordeal perfectly unscathed, with a characted unviolated, and he was told by the Bench when discharged that be left the court without a stain upon his character."], [285, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 247 In the face of that, and seeing that his fellow-workers at Friars Goose had taken so great an interest in the matter, he thought it was only right that the residents of Gateshead should lend a helping hand in order to the production of something tangible to manifest their sympathy for one who had been the victim of circumstances. He was glad to know, despite the opprobrium that some might cast upon them, that there were kindred spirits to himself in the move- ment who were ready and willing to carry out the good object, and always willing to assist their fellow-men. They might easily have raised considerably more money had they desired, but their wish was simply to give to Mr. Cameron a substantial token of the esteem in which they held him. After referring to the refusal ofthe Watch Committee to hold another investigation, he said that these accusations against Mr. Cameron had ceased to be bruited abroad, and he believed that that gentleman now enjoyed to a greater extent than ever the confidence and esteem, not only of those who had subscribed to the testimonial, but also the inhabitants generally. \u2014The inscription upon the watch was : \u2014 \" Presented to Mr, G. H. Cameron, by the inhabitants of Gateshead and vicinity, as a mark of sympathy under the unfortunate circumstances of which he was a victim, and as a proof of their confidence in his character.'' Mr. Cameron, in returning thanks, observed that he never dreamt, whilst in the lock-up, that he would receive anything of the kind. He believed that his imprisonment was a very simple matter, and that the same might have happened to any of them by mistake. February 19. \u2014 Under the auspices of Mr. Hare, an enterprising townsmen, the lovers of music in Newcastle and neighbourhood were enabled to enjoy a concert of the most attractive and brilliant character at the Town Hall. The vocalists who took part in the performance were all members of Her Majesty's Opera, and amongst them were not a few of the most celebrated musical artists of the day. Madlle. Titiens, Madame Siuico, Madlle. Justine Macvitz, and Signors Tombesi, Borella, Campobello, and Agnesi, were the vocalists who appeared on the occasion, and the enter tainment also included a masterly solo on the violoncello by Mons. B. Albert, and an equally remarkable pianoforte solo by the dis tinguished pianist, Mr. F. H. .Cowen, who also accompanied the various singers on that instrument throughout the evening. The programme was of a miscellaneous character, the greater part of it, however, consisting of favourite operatic selections, interspersed with which were some of the grandest airs of Handel, and one or two Scotch airs. Throughout the evening, the utmost enthusiasm was displayed by the fashionable and numerous audience, scarcely a single vocalist escaping an encore so unanimous and over whelming that compliance could hardly be denied. February 21. \u2014 A number of the bachelors of North Shields gave a grand ball to their friends and the leading inhabitants of the neighbourhood, in the Albion Assembly Rooms, North Shields, and"], [286, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. 248 the gathering proved one of the most brilliant of the kind ever held in that borough. March 4. \u2014 George Oliver, oarsman, in the service of John Ridley, tanner, &c, Hexham, who had been sent to Acomb Colliery for a cart-load of coals, in order to shorten the journey, attempted to cross the Tyne by the ford below the \" Dam Backs,\" and, in conse quence of the water being a little flooded, got out of his depth. The horse, in struggling, got his fore leg over the shaft, which caused the cart to capsize, Oliver, who was in the cart at the time, being below it. He managed to clear himself, and got on to a gravel bed, from which he was rescued by a boat, little the worse for his immersion. The horse aud cart floated down the river for a considerable distance, the horse, a valuable one, being drowned. March 10. \u2014 Lord Crewe's Charities, having become the subject of much public comment, an inquiry was instituted by the Charity Commissioners, which resulted in the Attorney-General preparing the following scheme for the future guidance of the trustees : \u2014 Of the scheme itself, which is somewhat voluminous, we can but give a general outline. As heretofore, the estates and property are to be under the control of trustees, the number of whom are to be five ; one of whom is to be rector of Lincoln College, in the Uni versity of Oxford, ex-officio. The general meetings are to be held at the half-yearly rent days in April and October, but power is given to the trustees to hold special meetings. If the trustees think fit to appoint a secretary or clerk during their pleasure, they may do so, allowing *' for his care and pains in the performance of his office, such annual sum as they shall think fit, not exceeding the sum of \u00a3100, including travelling expenses.\" Power of appointing a receiver is reserved to the trustees of the rents of the charity estates ; the allowance to that officer being fixed at the rate of \u00a33 15s. per cent, per annum on the sum actually received by him. The two last-named officers, however, may, if thought expedient, be combined, and in such case the per centage is increased to \u00a34 5s. per annum. Moreover, authority is given to the trustees to appoint one of their own body \" who may be willing to undertake the duties gratuitously to execute the office of secre tary,\" and he is to be allowed such sum as he shall actually expend. With regard to the presentment to benefices, whenever a vacancy occurs in the ecclesiastical benefices of Bambrough, Shotley, and the perpetual curacies of North Sunderland aud Blanchland, power of presentment is given to the trustees. Clause 20 continues the payment of the several yearly sums, amounting to \u00a31,090, given by Lord Crewe's will. After making the payments amounting to the last-mentioned sum, the trustees may expend \u00a31,800 annually \" in maintaining, or supporting, or assisting\" schools for the education of the poor classes within the parishes of Bambrough, North Sunderland, and surrounding districts, \" or in any other parish or place in which any of the charity is situate,"], [287, "A.D. 1872.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 249 including the school for the instruction and boarding of girls maintained at the Castle.\" The expenditure \" may include provi- sion for the clothing of inmates of the aforesaid girls' school and exhibitions, or other pecuniary rewards or assistance to deserving scholars of boys' schools supported or assisted by the trust during their continuance at such schools or afterwards at the discretion of the trustees.\" Under the proposed scheme the stipend of the Incumbent of Bambrough is to be increased to \u00a3100 annually, in addition to the annual rent charge of \u00a345 secured out of the charity estate at New Shoreston, and \u00a350 yearly towards a curate ; the incumbent of North Sunderland \u00a3205 annually, with the like rent charge ; the incumbent of Beadnell \u00a340 yearly ; the incumbent of Blanchland \u00a3200 yearly ; the incumbent of Shotley \u00a3176 13s. 4d. yearly; the incumbent of Hunstan worth \u00a360 yearly; the incumbent of Whittonstall, \u00a310 yearly. Besides these augmentations, the trustees may, from time to time, make grants to the amount of \u00a3200 a-yeir towards the repair or construction of churches and chancels at Bambrough, Shotley, Norham, and Hanstanworth, and of residents for these incumbencies, except Shotley. Another laudable provision is the power now given to expend a sum not exceeding \u00a3350 annually, \" in maintaining a surgery or dispensary at Bambrough Castle, and other charitable provisions for the sick poor of Bambrough and the neighbourhood, and oftheotherestat.es of the Trust.\" Lord Crewe's intentions are strickly adhered to in this scheme, and the provision of a yearly sum of \u00a3150, \" in aid of crews and ships in distress and shipwrecked sailors, and in main- taining a fog gun or signal at or near the Castle, including a subscrip- tion of not exceeding \u00a325 a-year towards the maintenance of a lifeboat,\" are such as will be appreciated by the public. While specific powers are given to the trustees, and increases are made in different directions, there are a number of poor alms-people at Durham, Bishop Auckland, Brackley, and Hinton, and are recipients of Lord Crewe's bounty, who will have to depend upon the trustees for any future increase. Clause 25 says, after paying the \u00a31.090 left by the will, the trustees \" may, if they see fit, subscribe towards parochial and other charitable purposes connected with the Trust and with the estates of the Charity, and may grant charitable pen- sions to persons connected with the Charity, and sball be proper objects for such relief ; but the total annual expenditure is never to exceed \u00a3300.\" If, however, the pensions now paid exceed that sum annually, they are not to be discontinued, but no fresh pensions are to begranted, and the amount ofthe subscriptions for charitable purposes is to be reduced until the expenditure falls within the limit mentioned. An annual sum of \u00a3300 is to be paid by the trustees to a middle class school, \" principally for the sons of far- mers,\" at Haydon Bridge. Out of the funds in court \u00a35,000 is to be paid as follows : \u2014 \" \u00a3600 to build a parsonage and schoolmaster's house at Shotley; \u00a31,500 for building schools at Bambrough and Thornton ; \u00a3200 for a school at Oxford ; the like at Newbold Ver- Ff"], [288, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [A.D. 1873. 250 non, in Leicestershire ; and \u00a32,500 towards erecting new buildings at Haydon Bridge, when \u00a312,500 has been raised by subscription or mortgage.\" After making the several payments mentioned, 316-1090 parts of the surplus nett income of the charity estate are to be applied to the augmentation of the income of stipends, the alms people, the master of the Bishop Auckland National Schools, master's income for teaching twenty boys gratis, and for their clothing, the remaining 774-1090 is to go towards founding a convalescent hospital at Bambrough Castle. Towards the latter laudable object the moneys are to accumulate until \u00a310,000 is raised, and untill that sum is obtained the trustees have, in order of seniority, the privilege of occupying the keep and other portions of the castle not required by the scheme at a rent. After the hospital fund has reached \u00a310,000, the castle is then to become a convalescent hospital. The present dispensary is by degrees to merge into the hospital, and the trustees may make bye-laws regu lating the admission of convalescent patients from any place in England and Wales to the hospital. March 16. \u2014 An alarming outbreak of fire took place in Killing worth Church this morning, and was not entinguished until very considerable damage had been done to the fittings and embellish ments of the interior. March 17. \u2014 The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of a new Catholic Church at the Felling was performed by the Right Rev. Dr. Chadwick, Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, in the presence of a numerous gathering of members of that communion. The style of the building is what is known as Gothic of the decorated period. The body of the edifice consists of a broad nave, 90ft. by 30ft., with a narrow aisle on each side, making the total width 55ft. The chancel adds 30ft to the length of the church, and it has a side chapel and vestry on each side. The tower is perforated in order to give access to the nave from the street on which it abuts. The height ofthe tower and spire is 180 feet. The special features of the interior are very tall arcades, and the absence of a clerestorey. The church will accommodate about 800 persons. March 24. \u2014 A woman named Mary Ann Cotton was executed this morning, within the gaol at Durham, for the murder of her stepson. The culprit had been poisoning on a wholesale system prior to discovery ; and had the evidence failed in the case for which she was convicted, there were several other cases against her. March 29. \u2014 The launch of the largest vessel ever built upon the Tyne, up to this date, took place this afternoon, from the yard of Messrs Charles Mitchell and Co., Walker. The ship was named \" The Hooper,\" was 5,000 tons burthen, and was intended for laying submarine telegraph cables. The launch was very success ful, and was witnessed by a large concourse of spectators. April 7.\u2014 This afternoon, a serious accident occurred at the Hartlepool Docks. A newly-built screw-steamer, Kong Svera, the"], [289, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 251 largest vessel ever launched in the Tees, which had been towed round to Hartlepool to receive her engines, was laid beneath \" the shears,\" belonging to Messrs. Richardson and Sons, for that pur pose, and, accordingly, a huge boiler, weighing upwards of thirty tons, was hoisted to the top of the shears previously to being lowered on board. Soon after the signal had been given to lower away, an ominous sound was heard by the workmen, indicative of a breakage, and the men ou deck called to their comrades below to stand clear. Scarcely had they done so, when the shears, with the suspended boiler, which had now being lowered within a few feet of the bottom of the hold, gave way with a loud crash, and fell across the steamer amidships. The two immense upright pieces of timber, each nearly eighty feet high, did no serious dam age by their fall, but the lowering chains, which were very massive, completely cut through a large wooden and slated building, over which they pass, scattering the materials in all directions. The most marvellous part of the affair is that, although upwards of thirty men were employed either in the ship or on the quay, not the slightest personal injury resulted ; but the damage involved a loss of several hundreds of pounds. The noise of the accident was so loud as to arouse the attention of some hundreds of persons in the locality, who rushed through the railway station to the dock side, to the place of the disaster, the scene being, for a few minutes, one ofthe utmost excitement, until it became known that no one was killed. April 12. \u2014 A great political demonstration in favour of Manhood Suffrage, which had been anticipated with much interest in the North of E gland, took place this afternoon, on the Town Moor, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was attended with such a measure of suc cess and enthusiasm as must have been exceedingly gratifying to those who laboured so assiduously and earnestly in its organisa tion. The working men connected with almost every branch of trade in the two Northern counties were largely represented, many of them in thousands. The trade societies and committees of miners' associations sent in returns to the committee in charge of the demonstration, and from these returns it appears that from 73,000 to 74,000 had given notice of their intention to be present. Apart from these there were others not calculated upon, and alto gether those who took part in the procession could not have num bered less than 80,000 people. Long and imposing as the proces sion was, it might have been still larger had it not been for those who, placed by ballot in the rear, got impatient, and joined the throng on their way to the Moor. When all were gathered, the crowd represented not less than 200,000 people. . The receipts for the North-Eastern Railway Company for the week ending the 12th inst., which included the passenger traffic ofthe Manhood Suffrage Demonstration day, exceeded by the large sum of \u00a320,224 the return for the corresponding week of 1872."], [290, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. 252 April 17* \u2014 Mr. Samuel Plimsoll, M.P. for Derby, having taken up the cause of the sailors of this country, and laboured hard for their amelioration, a large and influential meeting was held in the Lecture Room, Nelson Street, Newcastle, this evening (presided over by by Mr. Jos. Cowen, Jun.), to support a bill he had brought forward in Parliament. Mr. Plimsoll was to have attended the meeting in person and deliver an address; but, owing to severe indisposition, was unable to attend. April 21. \u2014 The ceremony of opening the handsome schools, erected by order of the Hedworth, Monkton, and Jarrow School Board on the Grange Estate, took place in the presence of a nume rous company of ladies and gentlemen, including several ardent friends of education. The ceremony was of more than ordinary interest, from the fact that the Grange Government School was the first in the north\u2014 if not in the country \u2014 which bad been erected specially under the provisions of the Elementary Education Act. The school was designed to accommodate 400 boys, 300 girls, and 300 infants \u2014 a total of 1,000 children. The entire cost of the whole, exclusive of the cost of site, was \u00a35,000. April 24. \u2014 The marriage of Mr. Charles Tyrrell Cavendish, second son of the Hon. Richard Cavendish, Thornton Hall, Bucks, with Miss Elizabeth Anne Dickinson, eldest daughter of Mr. Robert Dickinson, Shotley House, was solemnised at St. Cuthbert's Church, Benfieldside. The bridesmaids (eight in number) were the three Misses Dickinson (sisters of the bride), the two Misses Cavendish 'vsisters of the bridegroom), Miss Blanche Hodge, Miss Rachel Rayne, and Miss Hole. On the conclusion of the service in the church, the bridal party returned to the residence of the bride's father and partook of a splendid wedding breakfast. Amongst the company were Sir George and Lady Philips, the Earl and Countess of Camperdown, Lord and Lady Abercromby, the Earl and Countess of Caithness, Sir Thomas and Lady Abdy, Sir Philip and Lady Duncombe and Miss Duncombe, the Hon. Richard Cavendish (father of the bridegroom), the Hon. Fred. Cavendish, Miss Carring ton, the Hon. Anne Cavendish, Colonel Atkinson, Sir William and Lady Marriott, and others. The happy couple left Shotley Bridge about three o'clock for London. In the evening, the father of the bride gave a grand ball in the Town Hall, Shotley Bridge, which was attended by the principal inhabitants of the neighbourhood and a large number of visitors from Newcastle, lor whose convenience a Bpecial train was run at the close of the ball back to town. April 25. \u2014 This morning, a very handsome structure, which had been erected at Hebburn, was formally opened and dedicated to public worship ; the opening ceremonial taking the form of divine service, was conducted by the Rev. D. Frazer, D.D., of London, who also preached a very excellent sermon on the occasion. The corner-stone of this new church was laid on the 18th of June, 1870, by Mr. Andrew Leslie, the head of the well-known iron shipbudders"], [291, "A.D. 1872.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 253 at Hebburn, and had consequently been little short of three years in course of erection. The building, which is of the early decorated English style, stands on an elevated piece ot ground in the centre of the town, overlooking the river Tyne, and its external appearance is very striking and imposing. At the north-east corner is an exceedingly well-proportioned tower and spire, the latter rising to a height of 1 90 feet from the ground. The tower, which is sub stantial, but quite in keeping with the remainder of the building, is carried several feet above the pointed roof of the nave, the spire springing from it at this point, and each of its four angles being adorned with pinnacles. A very handsome illuminated dial and clock occupies an elevated position in the tower, in which is also placed a peal of six bells. The seats, in which accommodation is provided for 700 persons, are open, and constructed of pitch pine varnished. The church is warmed with hot water pipes, which run along each aisle, and on each side of the grating is a very handsome parquetrie floor. The cost of the building was about \u00a310,000, the greater proportion of which had been contributed by Messrs. Leslie and Co., who also were at the expense of erecting the schools and institute adjoining. May 8. \u2014 A new organ of great power and beauty of tone, con sidered by good judges to be one of the finest in the district, was opened in the handsome Wesleyan Chapel in the village of Tyne mouth, this afternoon. June 5. \u2014 A movement having been set on foot to provide for the Mayor of Darlington, and future Mayors of Darlington, a gold chain of office, the presentation took place to day. The chain, which cost about \u00a3320, is composed of twenty gold rosettes connected by D Unks. At the back of six of these rosettes are engraved the names of the six Mayors who had presided over the town since its incor poration. Pendant from the chain is a gold cross in enamel, from which is suspended a medallion, bearing the borough Arms. The presentation was made by Mr. Backhouse, M.P. \u2014 The Mayor (Mr. Robert Luck) returned thanks, and remarked that he could probably say more than any other Mayor in England, and that was that he was the first Mayor of a town that had been presented with a chain by the first member of Parliament for the borough. June 7. \u2014 A most lamentable accident occurred on the Season Sands, half a mile south of the West Hartlepool Harbour piers. About 5 p.m., two young men, employed in the fitting shops of the North Eastern Railway Company at Hartlepool, engaged a smaU pleasure boat, in which they embarked for a row in the bay. After pulling about for nearly half an hour within the safe limits of the bar of the old harbour, they most foolishly ventured outside, the sea at the time being rough. They appeared to have proceeded in safety to a point to the southward of the entrance of the West Harbour, where, as is believed, they intended to attempt to land on the beach, near the bfeboat house ; and in so doing,"], [292, ". HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. 254 pulled in among the broken water, the consequences being that the boat quickly capsized. The poor fellows were observed /rom the shore to be clinging to the upturned bottom of the little craft, but they failed to hold on until a lifeboat, which was manned and put off to the rescue, succeeded in reaching them, and both were drowned. The boat and an oar were subsequently washed ashore, but neither of the bodies were recovered. The names of the deceased were John Wormald and John Hall Rider, each aged 21. June 24. \u2014 A sad coble accident occurred off Seaham Harbour, this evening about seven o'clock, which resulted in the drowning of five men. It appears that eight men, among whom was Morley Scott, jun , pilot's assistant, took a coble from the docks for the purpose of a sail. They rowed out of the harbour entrance, and when outside hoisted the sail, the wind at the time being W.N.W. and a little fresh. They sailed to the northward, and when about two hundred yards from the lighthouse rock a squall of wind came and capsized the cable, throwing out all the occupants. Two of the men, named Turns and Scott, caught each an oar which was floating, and so k< pt themselves on the suiface of the water until a coble manned by Mr. Wm. Thompson, printer, and Mr. Petch, bookbinder, who had seen the accident from the pier, rowed out and took them on board. The same boat succeeded in getting a man named Davison. Another small boat, also rowed out from the harbour and picked up John Jefferson and Ralph Hush, both in a very exhausted state. They pulled on to the beach opposite the North Terrace, and, with the assistance of others, the men were laid upon the shore. By this time the town was alarmed, and the sea banks were crowded with people. A doctor arrived, and means were taken to resuscitate Jefferson ; Hush, who was more conscious, being sent to the Infirmary After every known means had been used to restore animation to Jefferson, it was found that life was extinct, and the poor fellow's lifeless body was taken to his home which just two hours before he had left full of life. Turns states that one of the men whose body was not recovered, named Cowie, clutched at him and took him below the water three times. How he got clear of him he does not know, but he afterwards heard him call out he was done. Turns bade him keep his heart up, as he could see boats coming. He, however, sank, and no more was seen of him. Another man, named Miller, also sank soon after the catastrophe occurred. From the nearness to the shore at which Jefferson's body was got, it is supposed he had been swimming to the land. The men were all bottlemakcrs, with the exception of Scott, and were employed at the Londonderry Works. Turns and Scott were able to walk home, and seemed to be suffering only fron the shock to the system. The man Hush after wards died, although everything was done that could possibly be tried. The following are the names of those saved : \u2014 Morley Scott, Benjamin Turns, and Andrew Davison. Drowned :\u2014 Robert Miller, aged 35 years ; left widow and five children j John Jefferson, 33,"], [293, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 255 widow and four children ; Joseph Hall, 26, widow and four children ; James, Cowie, widow and six children; Ralph Hush, widow and seven children. June 24. \u2014 The grand carnival of the North\u2014 the Newcastle- Race Meeting \u2014 commenced to-day. On the 25th, the Northum berland Plate was won by Falkland (T. Osborne), beating Prodigal, Clearwell, and nine others. The following day, the Stewards' Cup was won by Tyro (Mills), beating Ringwood and others. June 26. \u2014 The fourth and eldest surviving daughter (Lady Mary Avarina) of the Marquis of Londonderry died, after a linger ing illness of nine months' duration, at Londonderry House, Park Lane, London. Deceased was iu her sixteenth year, and was a most promising and amiable young lady. The shock to the re spected nobleman's family was very great, and called forth expres sions of condolence and sympathy from innumerable friends. The mournful intelligence was made known in Seaham Harbour by a telegram to Mr. Eminson, his lordship's agent, and soon the various tradesmen and several private families exhibited their respect by half-closing the shops and drawing down the blinds. The shipping in the docks also hoisted their flags half-mast high. July 23. \u2014 Newcastle-on-Tyne was visited by a thunderstorm of unusual severity. The peals of thunder, which followed each other in rapid succession, were exceedingly loud, and the lightning was remarkably bright and vivid. Towards the latter stages of the storm, rain fell in heavy torrents, many of the streets presenting quite a deluged appearance, but no accident was reported as having occurred in the town. A little boy, 9 years of age, son of Mr. Beal, landlord of the New Winning public-house, Walk-end, was killed by the lightning. The electric fluid struck the top of the house, knocked down a portion of the roof, and passed to the de ceased boy, who was sitting at the bedside putting his trousers on, striking him on the right side, and killing him almost instantane ously. His brother had just left the room, and was proceeding down stairs when the sad occurrence took place. In the vicinity of Alnwick the lightning was most vivid, and the thunder awful. A chimney at the Borough Schools was struck down ; and at the old Correction House, the chimney was also struck by the light ning, and the materials were driven through the roof into the kitchen, and the cups and saucers on the breakfast table were smashed to pieces, the occupants having a most fortunate escape. A farmer at Holiwell, near Alnwick, had seventeen sheep killed. June 23. \u2014 A terrific thunderstorm began to sweep over the coast from the westward this morning, when the lightning was very vivid and instantaneous. Some stables aud out-houses were struck by the lightning in North Shields, but no personal injury was sustained. The awful effect of the storm had to be felt at sea. A fleet of Scotch fishing boats, which had been to the herring fishing, and were returning to the Tyne market, were caught by"], [294, "256 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. the storm at about ten to fifteen miles from Tynemouth Castle ; the thunder clouds, after they had blown off the land, appeared to have settled down almost level with the ocean, and when the Scotch boats ran into the storm the war of the elements was some thing frightful to look at. The lightning was remarkably vivid, and played about the masts of the boats in a most alarming man ner, while the thunder roared like a park of artillery. A Buckhaven boat, the Water Lily, No. 293, seems to have plunged into the very midst of the storm. At the time, John Thompson, a stout, powerful-looking fisherman, 38 years of age, was standing at the mast. The dangerous fluid appeared almost determined to encom pass the destruction of the poor little craft, and the crew were very much alarmed. The scene, as described by the survivors of the crew, appears to have been terrific. The masts of the boat were capped with iron, and possibly attracted by this the lightning struck the mast, which it split completely clown the middle. The electric fluid hit poor Thompson in the forehead, burning a hole in his sou'wester, and leaving a black mark over the brow. The master and another of the crew were struck down at the same moment. As soon as poor Thompson was struck he instantly, like a person shot, fell into the sea. The steersman directly let go the helm, and as the vessel was not under sail he got hold of one of the trouser legs with the boat hook. Thompson appears to have been killed instantly. The body was got on board, and the other two injured men were looked after by the steersman and his mate, but they were not seriously hurt. The boat was got into the Tyne in the afternoon, and the body was brought ashore. One ofthe men was partly paralysed below the knee, and the other fejt a good deal of pain aud numbness in the neck, but their injuries were not serious. John Thompson, the dead man, left a widow and three children. None of the other boats were struck. August 5. \u2014 A portion of the Greenwich Hospital property was brought to the hammer this day, at the Queen's Head, Newcastle. Th6 property, which was offered by direction of the Lords Commis sioners of the Admiralty, consisted of about 5,800 acres, situate in the townships of Elrington, Wharnley, West Quarter, Allerwash, and Fourstones, and lying on both sides of the South Tyne, west ward from it junction with its confluent, the North Tyne ; the whole a little westward of the town of Hexham. The estate was first offered in its entirety of 5,769 acres 1 rood 19 perches, the rental being stated to be \u00a36,480, with about \u00a31,000 more for mineral produce. The surface rental, it was suggested, was capable of increase, very considerable in some cases, while the revenue from minerals might also be greatly developed. No bidder appeared for the property as offered in this form, and it was next divided into two lots \u2014 the first comprising all the land on the south side of the river, and containing 4,370-j acres, and having a rental of \u00a34,385 13s. lOd. ; and the second containing about 1,399 acres, situate on the north side ofthe South Tyne, and having a rental of \u00a32,100,"], [295, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 257 independent of the minerals. The bidding for the first of these lots commenced with \u00a3100,000, and proceeded until ultimately \u00a3146,000 was reached, that being Mr. John Straker's offer, aud the property was at length sold to that gentleman. On the second portion \u2014 trbe 1,399 acres north ofthe Tyne \u2014 being sub mitted, the reserve was announced to be \u00a379,000, and this sum Mr. John Clayton consented to give, and he became the purchaser at that amount. August 21. \u2014 The Turf Hotel, Collingwood Street, Newcastle, was sold by auctioD. The property possesses a frontage of 120 feet, and stands on an area of something like 700 square yards. Brisk bidding was started by an offer of \u00a310,000, which sum was advanced upon at the rate of \u00a350 a bid. On an offer of \u00a314,000 by Mr. Waller, the reserve bid was withdrawn. The sum was brought up to \u00a314,100 by Mr. Waller ; and, eventually, the property was sold to the latter gentleman for the amount above named. September 1 . \u2014 This morning, a terrible and fatal explosion occur red in the limestone quarries of Mr. Wells, near West Boldon, which resulted in the instant death of two men, and the injury of others. Some half-dozen men were engaged on their usual work, in various positions, not far from a man named John Lockey, who was preparing a hole for blasting, in the usual way, with common blasting powder. Suddenly, and from some unknown cause, the materials in the hands of the unfortunate man Lockey exploded with a loud report, scattering the quarrymen who had the misfor tune to be nearest. Lockey himself was literally blown into the air in pieces, one of his legs falling into a field some hundred yards away, while the body, descending head downwards, sunk up to the shoulders in the soil on which it fell. The remains, scarcely recognisable as those of a human body, were gathered up, and after coffining, conveyed to the deceased's home in West Boldon. A man named Walter Welch was killed by the falling stone ; and another man, named William Graham, was frightfully injured from the same cause. A young man, named Robert Potter, bad his leg broken, but fortunately, beyond this and a slight cut or two on the head, he was not materially injured. Another of the men, named John Fee, who happened to be between Potter and one of the men who were killed, had a very narrow escape, but happily sustained no injury beyond a cut on one cheek. September 10. \u2014 The solemn opening of the Monastic Church at Red Barns, Newcastle, dedicated to St. Dominic, took place this morning, in the presence of a very large and fashionable congre gation. The services were conducted by Archbishop Manning, who was seated on his throne at the epistle side of the altar, his deacons being the Rev. H. Coll, Darlington ; Dr. Dumphy, Felling ; and the Rev. Arthur Riddell, Harrogate. Their Lordships the Hon. and Right Rev. Dr. Clifford and the Right Rev. Dr. Amherst occu- \u00bbg"], [296, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. 258 pied prominent seats in the chancel. The music was supplied by the choir of the church, assisted by an efficient orchestra. The chief attraction of the service was Haydn's Third (Imperial) Mass. At the offertory Buhler's \" Jesu Dulcis Memoria\" was sung ; and at the close of the service the choruses \" Achieved is the glorious work\" and \" The Heavens are telling,\" from \" Tho Creation,'' were also rendered by the choir. September 12. \u2014 Four men were killed by a boiler explosion at the Hive Ironworks, East Jarrow. The cause of the explosion had evidently been through want of proper inspection, the boiler being completely worn out and totally unfit for use ; and, at an inquest afterwards held, the jury returned a verdict to that effect. September 13. \u2014 The Claimant to the Tichborne Estates arrived in Newcastle-on-Tyne early this morning, and remained a few hours, when he took his departure for Spennymoor, to take part in a shooting match. September 15. \u2014 A shocking and terrible tragedy, which caused the most intense excitement amongst the inhabitants of Hetton, near Durham, was enacted at that place. A pitman named Michael Bainbridge was shot dead by a neighbour, named George Smith, jealousy being the alleged cause of the frightful deed. September 20. \u2014 An alarming fire, which was believed to be the work of an incendiary, took place at Lintz Ford paper mill, the property of Messrs. Annandale. This was the second fire that occurred at this place within four days. Messrs. Annandale, in addition to carrying on the business of paper manufacturers, were the proprietors of an extensive farm, in connection with which there was a large enclosure, containing upwards of a score of wheat and other stacks. Scarcely had the excitement occasioned by the first fire subsided, when intelligence reached Consett that another fire was raging at Lintz Ford, The superintendent and a staff of men at once proceeded to the scene of the conflagration, but by the time they reached Lintz Ford, a haystack, containing seventy tons, had nearly been consumed. There was no chance from the first of saving the hay stack, and the attention of the fire brigade was directed to the preservation of the other stacks and the paper mill itself. The river Derwent runs close to the farmstead, and by pouring a continual stream of water upon the burning stacks, the fire was prevented from spreading, and the following morning had burnt itself out. October 6. \u2014 A singular and destructive accident occurred to some new premises at Tynemouth. Mr. George Bruce, draper, was building large business premises in the front street, not far from the Independent Chapel. They were three-storied in height, and were being built of concrete. The large erection was nearly ready for covering, when the eastern portion of the premises fell, the main portion following, and the whole of the large building tumbled"], [297, "A.D. 187-.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 259 into a mass of ruins. The destruction was complete, and the loss considerable. The accident was supposed to have arisen from a miscalculation as to the quantity of cement that should have been used. October 8. \u2014 Messrs. C. Mitchell and Co., of Low Walker, near Newcastle, launched a splendid iron clipper, built expressly for a line of steamers trading between London and China. The vessel was one of the largest built on the Tyne, her length over all being 405ft., bean 42ft., and depth 30ft., and her gross tonnage about 4,000 tons. She has full poop, and is fitted for the accom modation of first-class passengers, topgallant forcastle for crew, and a range of houses amidships, about 100 feet long (with deck extend ing the full width of vessel), in which is provided accommodation for the officers, engineers, cooking galleys, and other usual offices. On leaving the ways the vessel was named Hankow by Mre. Mitchell, and was immediately laken in tow by four tugs to Messrs. R. and W. Hawthorn's works, St. Peter's to be fitted by that firm with compound engines of 400 horse power, embracing all the latest improvements for the economy of fuel. October 10. \u2014 The Mayor of Sunderland (A. G. McKenzie, Esq.,) gave a grand banquet in the Queen's Hotel, Fawcett Street, to the members of the Corporation, magistrates, and principal inhabitants, 104 ofthe 140 invitations issued being accepted. October 15. \u2014 The South Shields Free Library was formally opened to the public by the Mayor (Aid. Terrot Glover). The borough of South Shields, though not among the first towns in the kingdom to avail itself of the benefits of the Public Free Libraries Act, had the honour of being one of the first places in which that useful means of spreading and encouraging education \u2014 the Me chanics' Institute \u2014 was established. The South Shields Mechanics' Institute, or, as it was sometimes called, \" Scientific and Literary Institute,\" was established in the year 1824. October 16. \u2014 This afternoon, about ninety ladies and gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner, in the Freemasons' Hall, Stockton, after which a cheque for \u00a31,000 was presented to Mr. Marshall Fowler, J.P., Preston Hall, as a mark of esteem and appreciation of his public services for fifty years to the dis'rict. Mr. Joseph Dodds, M.P. for Stockton, occupied the chair; and, on rising to pio pose the health of Mr. Marshall Fowler, was received with loud applause. He regretted that many of the clergy had been prevented from being present on account of the Archdeacon's visitation. He read a letter from Mr. J. W. Pease, M. P , regretting that he was unable to attend, and expressing his sincere regard for his old and worthy friend, who, he hoped, would long be spared to his family and friends. He apologised for the absence of the Mayor of Stock ton, who, he regretted, was unable to be present on account of indis position, and explained that he (Mr. Dodds) had in consequence"], [298, "260 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1873. been asked to make the presentation to Mr. Fowler. In an exhaustive speech he traced the history of Mr. Fowler from June 6, 1817, w hen he was called to the bar, pointing out his many good qualities, and the social, political, professional, public and charitable movements he had been connected with in Stockton and the district during half a century. He concluded by handing to Mr. Fowler a cheque for \u00a31,000, which he said that gentleman would give to the treasurer of the Surgical Hospital for the purpose of building a Marshall Fowler wing to the new building. The ladies of Stockton had determined that Mr. Fowler should have some memorial in addition to the cheque, and had resolved to present him with a handsome tureen, which bore a suitable inscription. \u2014 Mr. Ford, on behalf of the ladies of Stockton, handed the tureen to Mr. Fowler, begging he would accept that memorial \u2014 Mr. Fowler's health was drunk amidst great cheering \u2014 Mr. Fowler, who was received with cheers, feelingly expressed his thanks for both gifts, and returned the cheque for \u00a3i,000 to the chairman, with a request that he would hand it over to the treasurer of the new hospital about to be built, to be applied towards the erection of an additional wing, to be named after him. He hoped it would be the means ot allaying and soothing the pains and infirmities of those who might occupy it. \u2014 The Chairman stated that, in the absence of the treasurer, he could not place the cheque in worthier hands than those of his friend Mr. Joseph Richardson, who had exerted himself so much in obtaining funds for the new hospital. Mr. Joseph Richardson, on behalf of the committee ofthe surgical hospital, thanked Mr. Fowler for his handsome gift, and trusted that it would be the means of conferring a lasting benefit on the poor of Stockton. October 21. \u2014 Sir Wm. Eden, Bart, of Windlestoce Hall, near Bishop Auckland, died very suddenly, this evening, at Lartington, near Barnard Castle. The deceased was a justice of the peace for the Bishop Auckland division ofthe county, where he acted for a considerable number of years, until he was ordered by his physician to give up the duties of that office on account of ill-health. Deceased was in his 70th year, and held the baronetcy since 1814, when he succeeded his brother. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, William, born in 1849. October 22. \u2014 Died, at Gateshead, at the sge of 58 years, Mr. William Cook. The deceased gentlemen left this neighbourhood with his parents at an early age, and for some years the family resided in Edinburgh, and subsequently in Dumbarton. He returr.ed to Tyneside when about 16 or 17 years of age, and found employment for a considerable period in the chemical works of Mr. Charles Attwood and Mr. Allen at the Felling. The chemical trade at that day was in its infancy, and Mr. Cook haying mastered its details, was afterwards able to render very efficient service in its development, and he attained a responsible and important position in the factory. After some time he retired from the"], [299, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 261 business, and commenced a glass works in bis own interest in Gates bead, and that establishment he carried on with advantage until it was disposed of to Messrs. Sowerby and Neville. Mr. Cook was also engaged in an ingenious process for making lucifer matches ; and for some period after his connection with the glass works ceased, he carried on a prosperous business in Gateshead as a brewer and malster. About the year 1854 he retired from com mercial pursuits, and a complimentary dinner was given him by bis friends on the occasion, many of the leading public men of Newcastle and Gateshead being present. Mr. Cook took an active part in public matters from an early period of his life. He was one of the promoters of the Gateshead Local Board of Health, and was chairman of that body. He was a member of the Town Council for a number of years, and subsequently he held the office of borough treasurer. For some fourteen or fifteen years he was a guardian ; and for a portion of the time he was chairman of the Board. Amongst other engagements, he filled the post of chair manship of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, being the first member elected to that office after its formation. Indeed, in all matters of a municipal or parochial character in the borough of Gateshead he took a prominent and useful part, He was likewise an ardent politician, and was recognised as the leader of the advanced Liberal party in the borough. He proposed Mr. Ralph Walters, the Radical candidate, for Gateshead in 1852, in opposition to Mr. Wm. Hutt and the Hon. Adolphus Liddell. From 1837 or 1838 he was more or less actively identified with all the Liberal associations of an advanced character that existed in the district. He discharged the office of chairman of the Northern Reform Union, and he manifested a lively concern in the contest in 1859, in which Mr. Peter Taylor was the Radical candidate for Newcastle. For nearly twenty years there was not a public man in the two boroughs who was more conspicuously engaged in the cause of advanced Liberalism than Mr. Cook. He was a clear and forcible speaker ; and was known amongst a large circle of friends for the vivacity and intelligence of his conversational powers. October 29. \u2014 A very interesting gathering took place near the village of Dunston, for the purpose of seeing the foundation-stone of Christ Church laid by the Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth. Prior to the foundation-stone ceremony, the clergy of the district met at the parochial school, and, accompanied by the villagers and scholars, marched in procession to the site. After the customary religious observances had been gone through, Mr. Henry Wallace advanced towards Lord Ravensworth, and formally presented him with a silver trowel with which to perform the task allotted him. A bottle containing parchments bearing details as to the proposed building, the names of the building committee, the subscribers to the church fund, together with the local newspapers of the day, and a number of current coins, was deposited in the cavily prepared for its recep tion. The mortar having been spread, the stone was placed in position and adjusted, whereupon his lordship declared it duly laid."], [300, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. 262 October 30. \u2014 Mr. David Lambert, a well-known bass singer, ex pired in a most sudden manner while performing his duties as a chorister in Durham Cathedral. On the members of the choir assembling for afternoon service, at four o'clock, Mr. Lambert was absent, but he joined them as they marched through the cloisters, and had evidently hurried to the Cathedral in order to be in time to perform his duties. After the absolution was pronouneed by the officiating clergyman, Mr. Whitehead, a tenor, observed something peculiar in Mr. Lambert, who sat between that gentleman and his father, Mr. Lambert, sen , and in the response, '' The Lord's name be praised,'' after the Lord's Prayer, he did not join. As the choir rose to sing the psalms which follow, it was palpable that Mr. Lambert was ill, and as Mr Whitehead was rising he fell over on to the latter's shoulder. Mr. Lambert, sen., caught hold of his son's arm to assists Mr. Whitehead to raise him, and the Dean of Durham, who was sitting nearly opposite, observing the position of affairs, hurried from his sta'l to the side of the trio to ascertain what steps were necessary, and he was followed by Archdeacon Bland, service being at once suspended. It was evident Mr. Lam bert's condition was very critical, and in order to obtain more air for him, he was carried to the marble step outside the communion rails, where he was laid down, with his head supported on cushions. He rapidly sank, however, and died within ten minutes ofthe first appearance of his illness. The service was not afterwards proceeded with. It was thought the cause of death was rupture to some of the vessels of the heart caused by the exertion he had sustained in hurrying to attend the service. Mr. Lambert had at the time of his death officiated as one of the bass singers in the Cathedral choir at Durham for a period of about ten years, and previous to that he had held appointments in York Cathedral, in the chapel at Lincoln's Inn London, in the chapel at Eton School, and in St. George's Chapel Royal at Windsor, which last post he occupied immediately prior to being chosen for a vacant place in the choir of Durham Cathedral. The deceased gentleman was 42 years of age at the time of his death. November 7. \u2014 The Mayor of Darlington (Mr. R. Luck), and the Mayoress (Miss Luck), were presented with a testimonial, in recog nition of the manner in which they had dispensed civic hospitalities during their twelve months of office. Subscriptions were freely obtained, and it was resolved that the testimonial should take the form of presenting a bracelet to the Mayoress, and entertaining the Mayor to a banquet This afternoon, the presentation was made to Miss Luck in the hall of the Mechanics' Institu'e, in the presence of a large number of the subscribers, including ladies and gentle men. Mr. Edmund Backhouse, M.P., presided, and in a few well chosen remarks, made the presentation. The mayor, he remarked, had always conducted the business of the town with a due regard to its municipal interests. In Darlington it happened that different views were takeu by different parties, and in consequence of this"], [301, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 263 conflict of opinion there had not been the same amount of hospi tality in municipal affairs that was found in other towns, where mayoral hospitality was given and received. Mr. Luck, however, had broken through the old rules by giving a ball to the inhabi tants, and iu receiving his guests on that occasion the Mayor was ably assisted by the Lady Mayoress. During his whole year of office, the Mayor had given entire satisfaction to all classes in the discharge of its duties, and, in presenting the bracelet to Miss Luck, he was only expressing the sentiments of the numerous subscribers when he said that it was offered as a slight but tangible token of their good wishes, and their desire that every blessiug and pros perity might be her portion. \u2014 The bracelet, which was of a Persian design, similar to others that had been made for members of the Royal family, was then placed on the Lady Mayoress's arm by Mr. Backhouse, amid applause. \u2014 The Mayor responded, and thanked the subscribers most cordially for their kindness both to himself and to bis daughter. \u2014 A complimentary dinner was afterwards given to the Mayor in the King's Head Hotel. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected Chief Magistrates for the principal boroughs of Northumberland and Durham : \u2014 Newcastle, Addison Potter, Esq., Mayor, Charles Henry Young, Esq., Sheriff; Gateshead, Councillor Charlton ; Tynemouth, Robert Watson Surtees, Esq. ; South Shields, Alder man Terret Glover ; Sunderland, A. G. McKenzie, Esq. (re-elected) ; Durham, Randal Stevenson, Esq. ; Hartlepool, John White, Esq. ; Stockton, George M. Watson, Esq. ; Darlington, Arthur Pease, Esq. ; Morpeth, Alderman Cranston. November 11. \u2014 An enquiry into the circumstances attending a terrible collision which occurred in Durham Railway Station on the 6th of this month, by which Mrs. Isabella Cable, aged 39 years, of Tunbridge Wells, iost her life, took place this morning at the Station Hotel, North Road, Durham. The jury returned the fol lowing verdict : \u2014 \" We find that Isabella Cable met with her death in the collision at Durham Station on the 6th November, and we find that such collision was caused by the gross neglect of the sig nalman, George Hill, of the East Cabin, and Henry Scruton, of the West Cabin, Durham. We also express our opinion that John Atkinson, the engine-driver of the East Coast express, should be more cautious when signals are doubtful, and that a block commu nication should be made between the East Cabin and Relly Junc tion.\" The coroner at once made out his warrant for the committal of the signalmen, Hill and Scruton, to take their trial for man slaughter at the Assizes. November 15. \u2014 Two American revivalists \u2014 Messrs. Moody and Sankey\u2014 who, after visiting the North of England, created quite a religious panic in various parts of the country, took a farewell of their friends at a meeting in Brunswick Place Chapel, Newcastle on-Tyne. The spacious place of worship was crowded to the doors"], [302, "264 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. by an earnest and devout congregation, it being estimated that not less than 3,000 persons were present. It was, indeed, one of the largest religious meetings ever held in the town, and was singu- larly representative in character. Merchants from the Quayside, wealthy coal-owners and large manufacturers, aldermen and town councillors, magistrates belonging to Newcastle and neighbouring boroughs, tradesmen (though the Saturday is the busiest day of the week), artisans, seafaring people, pitmen and their families, and members of county families, were in the congregation. The plat- form was crowded with ministers of all denominations, and also members of the Society of Friends. Mr. Moody presided, and Mr. Sankey conducted the singing. At the close ofthe service, a meet- ing was held for the purpose of taking steps to build a Religious Institute in Newcastle. In connection with this movement, Mr. Moody said he had been impressed by the idea that there was a great need for such a structure, on a model similar to that of the Mildmay Park Conference Hall in London. The object of the building would be to form a Christian union, where Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and members of other denominations could meet on one platform. It was the tabernacle that kept the tribes together, and why could not a tabernacle or temple be built in Newcastle, in order that the different denominations might keep themselves banded together in one great Christian union, in a place where they might meet, and by their united efforts keep back the dark waves of death and of hell ? When he first entered the town he was struck with astonishment that such a town should allow the Young Men's Christian Association to meet in a small, dirty room. Now, it would be best to erect such a building as he had named, and have the Young Men's Christian Association, Bible Society, and Sunday School Union on the same premises. He had faith to believe that there was a sufficient number of religious gentlemen in the town who would voluntarily give \u00a31,000 each towards this object. He then strongly urged the need of such an institution, and after doing so said he would appoint a committee in order to raise the amount required. December 18. \u2014 This morning, a destructive fire occurred at Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, and resulted in the total destruction of the main building of Mr. James Ryder's Model Steam Flour Mills, with a loss in money value of \u00a316,000, the premises being literally crammed with grain at the time. Some ten or twelve years previous the same unfortunate mill was blown down by an explo sion of gas. The building was four storeys in height, the grinding machinery being on the ground floor, the stones on the first floor, while the two upper ones were devoted to the warehousing of grain. The mill was left all right about nine o'clock at night, and about half-past two this morning when some miners passed on their way home from their work at the adjoining colliery they did not notice anything the matter with the place. One of them, however, who lived in the street, happened to look out of his window half an"], [303, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 265 hour afterwards, and then discovered the mill was on fire. He im mediately roused his neighbours, and ran for the police, the people getting out of the adjoining houses with their valuables, while a bed-ridden woman had also to be removed to a place of safety. Thanks to the the establishment of a telegraph to connect all the stations, the various sections of the police fire brigade were promptly on the spot, but they could do nothing beyond saving the adjoining property, as the building was so thoroughly on fire that the roof fell in half an hour after their arrival, with a blaze which lighted the whole neighbourhood. As far as could be seen or conjectured, the fire must have had its seat somewhere about the store room, and after it had burnt up to the roof it began to burn downwards, the floor falling in, while cascades of grain poured down and choked up the lower door and windows. In the afternoon, such was the shaky appearance of the end wall above the dwelling house that workmen were sent up to knock it down, and this they accomplished in safety. December 14. \u2014 Died, at his residence, The Grove, Westoe, South Shields, Mr. James Mather, aged 74 years. Deceased was a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was born in that town about December 23, 1799. Having received the early rudiments of education in the old borough, he proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he studied medicine and philosophy ; and it is recorded of him that he passed through the classes with honour. In 1827, when not 28 years of age, he invented a lifeboat, and placed it on board his father's vessel, the Mary. This was the first ship's lifeboat in use, and the timely iuventiou was singularly manifested on the 10th of July in the same year, when the Mary was wrecked in a gale on the rocks of Lessoe, in the Baltic, and the crew, after all efforts to reach them from the shore had failed, were saved by means of their own lifeboat. The fame of the new lifeboat attracted the attention of the Danish Admiralty, who personally inspected the wonderful boat at Copenhagen, obtained plans and sections of it, and so impressed was the Admiralty with the importance of the invention that the thanks of that body were conveyed to Mr. James Mather through the Danish Ambassador in England. The daring and humane spirit of Mr. Mather was shown also in connection with his own lifeboat, for during some of the experiments which took place in launching the boat on the 16th of February, 1825, a young sailor named Thomas Smith fell overboard, and was being carried away by the strong ebb, and must have been drowned, had Mr. Mather not jumped into the River Tyne and rescued him. He fought strongly, and with vigour and ability, in favour of Catholic Emancipation. In 1830-31 he was chairman of the Political Union of South Shields, and in 1832, at the first Parliamentary election for the borough of South Shields, he was chairman of Captain Gowan's (the Radical and independent candidate) committee ; while in the same year be was chairman at a banquet given to the veteran reformer, Mr Hume. Mr. Mather was presented with a silver cup H h"], [304, "266 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. by his fellow-townsmen in token of their respect. This was on the 10th December, 1832. In the same year Shields district was visited with the cholera, aud Mr. Mather again distinguished himself by his care of the afflicted. He was appointed a member of the Board of Health for the district by the Government. In 1834 Mr. Mather first appeared as an author, when he published \" The Constitutions of Great Britain, France, and the United States of America,\" a book which the Times of that day declared was an \" excellent text book for the politician.\" In 1838 he visited the United States, and on his return he delivered two lectures on the United States' system of government and slavery. The terrible explosion in St. Hilda's Pit, South Shields, by which, on the 18th of June, 1839, 52 lives were lost, drew Mr. Mather's attention to the perils of a miner's life. As soon as he heard of the accident, Mr. Mather hurried down the shaft and sought to relieve those in peril below. On the following day he was publicly thanked by his fellow-townsmen. On the occurrence ofthe explosion by which upwards of 70 lives were lost at Burradon Colliery, in 1860, Mr. Mather was actively at work. He made a careful examination of the miue after the accident ; and the evidence he gave was of a most complete and exhaustive character. During that long pending inquiry he was daily in attendance, and the assistance which he rendered did much to elucidatethe circumstances and causes of the terrible catastrophe. On the 1st September, 1839, Mr. Mather earned an address on vellum from the Royal Humane Society for his courage and huma nity in saving, at much personal risk, the lives of three boys who were blown off the land in a ship's boat. In 1842, Mr. Mather was authorised by a committee of shipowners and other inhabitants to find an independent candidate, of Radical principles, to contest the seat for South Shields against Mr. Robert Ingham, and Mr. Wawn, one of the first members of Parliament who went in for universal suffrage, was brought forward as the reform champion, and was carried in by a substantial majority. Mr. Mather, after this, be came chairman of the Anti-Corn Law Association, and presided over the first corn law repeal meeting iu the town of South Shields when Mr. John Bright first addressed the people of that borough. In 1846 Mr. Mather published a pamphlet on ships and railways. In 1845, on the 21st August, his attention was again directed to wards mining matters by the explosion at Jarrow Pit, when forty were killed. Mr. Mather, as in the Hilda explosion, lost no time in going down the pit on the merciful errand to save life. From coal mines Mr. Mather extended his researches into the value of fresh air, in connection with the more general affairs of life, and in 1847 he published a paper, read at the Society of Arts, London, \"On the Ventilation of Schools ,Churches, Public Rooms and Dwel ling-houses, and Confined Streets, Lanes, and Courts of Towns,\" in which he proposed to ventilate the sewers of London by the steam jet, as they did not exceed 500 miles in extent (less than the pas sages of ten of the largest collieries), and as in them to remove and"], [305, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 267 then destroy their gases. He advocated the cause of the sailors at a monstre meeting in Liverpool, and organised and headed a pro- cession of 15,000 sailors in London, who marched to Westminster, and presented a petition to Sir George Grey, then Home Secretary. These labours on behalf of the shipping trade, and the success w*hich crowned his efforts, prompted the shipowners of North and South Shields, when Mr. Mather returned, to entertain that gentleman to a splendid dinner. In 1S51 Mr. Mather, with Mr. Goldsvvorth \u2014 afterwards Sir Goldsworth Gurney \u2014 the discoverer of the Bude, and the inventor ofthe steam jets ventilation, proceeded to Scotland for the purpose of endeavouring to extinguish a fire which had been burning in the mines of .the Earl of Mansfield for 25 years. Mr. Mather and his fellow-labourer had the satisfaction of witnessing* o the complete success of their work. The fire was entirely extin- guished by means of forcing carbonic acid and nitrogen gases into the waste where the coal was burning. Mr. Mather was summoned to Newcastle to receive from the Coal Miuers' Society of Northum- berland and Durham a handsome silver cup, as a mark of their \" gratitude for his talented and praiseworty exertions in promoting measures to diminish the dangers from bad ventilation and other causes in the mines of this kingdom.\" The presentation took place in the Lecture Hall, on the 22nd March, 1851. He was frequently examined before Parliament respecting his pet subject, the ventila- tion of coal mines, and in 18-19 and 1852 he urged the necessity of legislating for the better safety of mines. After the success- ful extinguishment of the fire in the Earl of Mansfield's pits, Mr. Mather and Mr. Gurney were sent for to go to Bolton to put out a fire in one i f Lord Bradford's mines, and here, while leading a gang of men into the mine, when the fire was expected to have suc- cumbed to the gases forced in the workings, Mr. Mather was suddenly seized with the white damp and fell down insensible, in which condition he was dragged out of the mine. Fresh air, how- ever, restored him. Mr. Darlington, Government Inspector of Mines, who was present at the Bolton fire, spoke thus on Mr. Mather's tuccess on the occasion: \u2014 \"The advantages which Mr. Mather and Mr. Gurney have conferred on coal mining are invalu- able, andas for the judgment and energy of Mr. Mather in the colliery yesterday, I could not have believed it unless 1 had been present. He is a man in a million.\" In the midst of all these exhausting and absorbing labours, Mr. Mather did not forget his own district, but gave considerable thought to borough and river matters On the latter subject he, by his forcible and facile pen, urged the improvement of the river so as to render it a harbour of refuge, and he was, along with Mr. Joseph Cowen \u2014 afterwards Sir Joseph Cowen, M.P.-^one of a deputation sent by the four river towns to urge their claims upon the Admiralty and the Government, When the River Conservancy was formed into a Commission, Mr. James Mather was placed on the Commission for South Shields, and for many years he advocated at the river board the liberal course of"], [306, "268 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1873. improvements which has converted the Tyne into the now noble river. December 19. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Stella Hall, Blaydon-on- Tyne, Sir Joseph Cowen, M.P. for Newcastle-on-Tyne, at the age of 73 years. Sir Joseph was born at Greenside, a small village in the neighbourhood of Winlaton, on the 10th of February, 1800. His father was a chainmaker, and he served his time to the same trade. The family, it may be stated, came originally from Holy Island, near Berwick-on-Tweed, whence, many years ago, a Joseph Cowen journeyed to Stella, and became a drayman at the Stella Brewery. About that time the famous iron factory of Ambrose Crowley and Company was in the height of its prosperity in the neighbouring villages of Winlaton, Swalwell, and Winlaton Mill. The sons of the Stella drayman were apprenticed to the then owners of Crowley's factory. In the year 1814 that establishment was curtailed and re organised, the works being removed from Winlaton, and the whole business concentrated at Swalwell and Winlaton Mill. Several of the most energetic of the workmen who had been employed at the factory, and also some of the under-managers and clerks, commenced small undertakings on their own behalf, and amongst them was Sir Joseph's father, who became the employer of the members of his own family and a few workmen. Sir Joseph continued to labour at his trade at Winlaton, and at Messrs. Hawkes' factory at Gates head, until about the year 1823 or 1824, when he joined his brother in-law, Mr. Anthony Forster, in the fire brick business at Blaydon Burn. He acted at first as general manager, afterwards he became a partner, and ultimately he acquired sole possession of the pro perty. The works had then existed for a period of sixty years, but the trade in fire clay goods had been limited. Upon the develop ment of the iron industry of this country, the establishment of gas works, and the building of coke ovens, the demand for the kindof goods manufactured at Blaydon Burn largely increased. Sir Joseph gave great attention to the investigation of the chemical properties of the raw material, and the result was that by a process of mixing and tempering the various sorts of clay, a product was obtained which was found to stand a very large amount of heat. In the manufacture of fire clay goods he achieved much success. Although engaged in farming to some extent, and also in iron manufacture, and in coal mining and coke making, the chief portion of his com mercial life was devoted to the development of the fire clay business. Several years prior to his decease he devised new machinery for the grinding and tempering of fire clay, which has now become generally used in the trade. He was one of the first who manufactured gas retorts from that material, and he took out two patents for new processes for making the retorts which he invented. The connection of Sir Joseph with the River Tyne Commission dates back to its formation. Many years ago a strenuous effort was made by the people of North and South Shields to procure the withdrawal of the control over the river from the Corporation of Newcastle, and the"], [307, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 269 constitution of a representative body in whom the management should be vested. It was objected that the revenues derived from the shipping belonging to the seaport borough should not be expended in improving and beautifying the streets of Newcastle. The inhabitants of Shields protested against this unjust appropria tion of the moneys they contributed ; and also against the imperfect engineering operations carried out by the Corporation. A bill was promoted in Parliament with the object of securing the proposed transfer of the management of the river to an elective body com posed of representatives from all the Tyneside populations. Sir Joseph Cowen supported the principle embodied in the project, and strove to obtain for the inhabitants residing along the western reaches of the river a fair representation on the new Board. He maintained that one half of the navigable channel of the Tyne lay westward of Newcastle, and that it was but fair that not only the two Shields and Gateshead should share with Newcastle in the control, but also that the western portion of the the river should have its direct representatives on the proposed Commission. Within a recent period, when an effort was made to secure an advance from tho Public Works Loan Commissioners in aid of the river works, and after the loan had bpen promised, an attempt was made, by some parties connected with the river Tyne, to create an unfavour able impression on the mind of the Government for the purpose of preventing the fulfilment of the promise with regard to the public loan. Sir Joseph Cowen thereupon had a statement prepared of the operations of the body, with an account of its whole proceedings, directing attention to the improvements that had been effected in the river, and the consequent development of the trade of the port, all of which information was forwarded to Mr. Gladstone. That gentleman had himself, on his visit to Newcastle some years ago, had an opportunity of inspecting the works in the river, and noting its vastly improved resources, and a favourable impression had been created in his mind in respect to the extent and character of the undertaking. The correspondence and Sir Joseph's interview with him again brought the matter under the observation of Mr. Glad stone. The assistance sought by the Commissioners was granted, and it was in recognition of his services in connection with that body, which, through these negotiations, were brought before the Prime Minister, that he received the honour of knighthood. The letter conveying the intimation of Her Majesty's intention was read at a meeting of the Tyne Commissioners as follows : \u2014 \" 10, Down ing Street, Whitehall, Nov. 21, 1871.\u2014 Dear Mr. Cowen.\u2014 Allow me to tender you, with Her Majesty's approval, the honour of knighthood, in acknowledgment of the public service which you have rendered for so long a time and with so much ability as Chairman of the River Tyne Commissioners. If it be agreeable to you to accept this proposal it will be very gratifying to me to have tendered it. \u2014 I remain, with sincere respect, faithfully yours, W. E. Gladstone.\" When quite a young man he began to take a"], [308, "270 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1873. warm interest in political questions, and at the early age of 19 he became one of an active party of Radical politicians, and secretary to a \"class\"\u2014 as the organization of the Reformers was then termed \u2014 in connection with the political movements of the day. On the occasion of the first Reform demonstration held on Newcastle Town Moor, in October, 1819, for the purpose of protesting against the Peterloo massacre, he was one of those who organised and conducted the Winlaton division to the meeting. He was a staunch adherent to the political principles expounded by the late Lord Durham, and he was a warm admirer of that distinguished statesman. In all the organisations and meetings connected with the Reform cause in the northern division of the county of Durham, from the year 1820 to 1832 and 1845, Sir Joseph Cowen was actively engaged. He was a member of the Northern Political Union, of which asso ciation Mr. Charles Attwood was president, and which included amongst its most prominent members Mr. Charles Larkin, Sir John Fife, Mr. Thomas Doubleday, Mr. Eneas McKenzie, Mr. W. H. Brockets, and several others. Sir Joseph was also one of the earliest members of the Anti-Corn Law League, and of the associations formed for the purpose of giving proper effect to the principles so strongly enunciated by Sir Joseph Hume, Sir Joshua Walmsley, and others. In February, 1865, the advanced Liberal party in Newcastle presented a requisition, bearing 2,178 signatures, to Sir Joseph Cowen, inviting him to become a con. idate for the representation of the borough in Parliament. He complied with the -request, and in the July following he was returned at the head of the poll. Sir Joseph was nominated at that election by Lieut.-Colonel Perkins, then Mayor of the borough of Newcastle,'and seconded by Mr. John Mawson, the poll being officially declared as follows:\u2014 For Mr. Cowen, 2,940 votes; the Right Hon. T. E. Headlam, 2,479 ; and Mr. S. A, Beaumont, 2,062. At the general election in 18G8 a contest again took place. Sir Joseph was pro posed by Mr Hugh Taylor and seconded by Mr. William Bainbridge, and he also on that occasion headed the poll, having received 7,057 votes; his former colleague, Mr. Headlam, having 6,674, and the defeated candidate, Mr. C. F. Hamond, 2,727. The hon. member advocated in Parliament those opinions which he had consistently held through life, and was a staunch supporter of Mr. Gladstone. During his last session in Parliament, his health was such as to prevent him giving so much attention as he desired to his Par liamentary duties ; but during the earlier sessions he was one of the most constant attcnders in the House. He voted with the Government in every division on the Reform Bill, and also on the Irish Church and Land Bills and other leading Liberal measures. During the negotiation of the Commercial Treaty with France, Sir Joseph w as invited by the Government, at the instance of Mr. Cob den, to accompany him and other gentlemen to Paris to settle the details of that measure. He was engaged in the negotiations with the French authorities for several months, and on their successful"], [309, "A.D. 1873.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 271 completion he received a medal, and the formal thanks of the French and Euglish Governments for his services. It only remains to be added that Sir Joseph married in 1822, Mary, daughter of Mr. Anthony Newton, of Winlaton, a workman at the Garesfield Colliery, belonging to the Marquis of Bute, and had four sons and two daughters. On the receipt of the intelligence ofthe death of the lamented gentleman in the district of Shields, the flags were hoisted half-mast-high at the Harbour Master's Office, River Police Station, at Shields, and upon the steamboats, ferries, and other craft belonging to the River Tyne Commissioners. The steamers of the Tyne General Ferry Company were also in mourning. There was a general manifestation of regret in the seaports at the death of Sir Joseph Cowen, M.P. December 23. \u2014 The ceremony of opening the new park near the centre of the Leazes, Newcastle-on-Tyne, was performed this after noon, in the presence of a large number of spectators, by Mr. G. W. Hodge, Chairman of the Town Moor Management Committee of the Newcastle Corporation. In the absence of the Mayor (Mr. Addison Potter), the ex-Mayer (Mr. R. Cail) assumed the insignia of office, and, supported by the Sheriff and Under-Sheriff, who were also clad in their official robes, took his place at the head of the procession, which was formed on the main pathway of the park. Next in order came the members of the Corporation, followed by the general public. December 23. \u2014 The remains of Sir Joseph Cowen, M.P., were interred in the family vault at Winlaton, in the presence of a large number of sorrowing triends. The funeral was intended to be of a strictly priaate character \u2014 there being no one invited but pall-bearers, and a few of the oldest workmen and agents \u2014 but so great was the public desire to pay respect to the deceased, that the grounds around Stella Hall were thronged for some time previous to the hour appointed for the removal ofthe corpse. The members of the Tyne Improvement Commission made their appearance in a body of their own accord ; as also did several members of the Newcastle and Gateshead Corporations, and a large majority of the tradesmen of Blaydon, Stella, and Winlaton. Business, indeed, was pretty generally suspended in these places, and most of the bouses had drawn blinds ; while on the river the flags of vessels were hoisted half-mast high, and, in several of the local factories, the workmen ceased operations until after the procession had moved past. The body was encased in shell, lead, and panelled oak coffins ; the latter of which was surmounted by a brass plate, bearing the inscription : \u2014 \"Joseph Cowen, Knight, born Feb. 10, 1800; died Dec. 19, 1873.\" December 26. \u2014 One of the most appalling catastrophes which had occurred for many years took place on the river Tyne, near Northumberland Dock, this morning, and resulted in the drown ing of eighteen men. A large majority of the workmen of the"], [310, "270 HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1873. River Tyne Improvement Commissioners resided in North and South Shields, and were conveyed early every day to the respective works and dredgers by one of the regularly engaged steamtugs. The men \u2014 who are described as an exceedingly cautious, regular, and steady body \u2014 assembled at their usual starting places, at five o'clock in the morning, and waited iu readi ness for the boat. It was intensely dark at the time, and a cold wind blew fresh from the water ; and, therefore, when the Gipsy Queen steamed up to the new quayside at North Shields, the men lost no time in getting themselves comfortably sheltered in the fore and aft cabins. After paddling slowly to the south side borough, another contingent was taken on board, and these also went below out of the darkness as soon as the vessel set off upon her journey. After calling at the Tyne Dock landing, the steamtug proceeded up the river at a good speed \u2014 the tide being half-flood. When passing the east end of Howdon Dock, apparently quite right and safe, her career was suddenly checked by a most unaccountable and unlooked for mishap. It appeared that one of the largest of the Commissioners' hoppers had got into collision with a steamer belonging to Hull sometime on the preceding evening, and had sunk only a short way from the No 4 dredger, which was working at a distance of about fifty yards from the dock entrance. The sunken hopper, 80ft. long, lay athwart the channel, and was a most formidable obstruction to the navigation ; but still, in order to render the hidden danger as harmless as they possibly could, the Commissioners had altered the position of the dredger so as to cover one end of the wreck, and at the other they had moored a boat from which could be displayed a large red flag in the daytime, and a brilliant white light to indicate the spot in the darkness. From some cause, then unexplained, the person in charge of the Gipsy Queen did not keep her well out on the river while pas sing this spot, and hence she met with a mishap which resulted in a perfectly lamentable destruction of human life, and which threw a sorrowful gloom over the whole neighbourhood. December 30 \u2014The inauguration of a new town hall and public markets at Houghton-le-Spring was celebrated by a dinner at the White Lion Hotel, at which most of the leading inhabitants were present. With a population of 30,000 within a radius of five miles of Houghton, the want not only of a public market, but of a public hall, where anything like a high-class entertainment could be accommodated, or where a meeting could take place at which even a tithe of the inhabitants could be present, had long been felt. This desideratum was at length supplied by a limited liability company, formed amongst the inhabitants, who chose for the site of their new hall and markets the lower end of the buildings at the foot of Sunderland and Newbottle Streets, where a substantial edi fice is now reared. On the ground floor are a number of shops facing into Newbottle Street, behind which is the market enclosure, which is nearly square in form, and has seventeen shops round its"], [311, "A.D. 1874.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 273 sides, with a good deal of vacant space for visitors in front, a foun tain of an ornamental character forming an unique centre-piece. The whole is lighted by a glass roof, aud access to the enclosure is obtained by doors from Sunderland Street on one side, and New bottle Street on the other. Over tho shops in the latter thorough fare is the town hall, a spacious apartment, and one of the finest of its kind in the colliery villages of the county of Durham. It is 75ft. long by 25ft. broad, and is capable of accommodating com fortably 700 persons. It is lighted by three chandeliers and warmed by fires in the room, and has retiring room and dressing apartments behind the platform and above the hall, and there is also a hall-keeper's bouse. (1874) January 5. \u2014 This morning, Charles Dawson, E. Gough, and William Thompson, three men convicted of wilful murder, and sentenced to undergo the extreme penalty of the law, were executed within the precincts of Durham Gaol, in the presence of a group of persons, consisting ofthe Under Sheriff (R. Bowser, Esq.) aud his officers, aud of the officials of the prison. Charles Dawson was sen tenced to death for the murder of Martha Jaae Addison, who belonged to Bishop Auckland ; Edward Gough for the murder of James Partridge, at Sunnyside ; and William Thompson, for the murder of his wife, at Annfield Plain.

Deceased was born at Nun wick Mill, North Tyne. He came to Newcastle when 14 years of age, and engaged himself to Messrs. Currie and Co., chemists, Sandhill. After fulfilling his engagement, he went to Mr. Phillip Spencer, chemist, of the Side, near the foot of Dean Street. Not caring to follow the profession he had chosen in early life, he was prevailed upon by his brother-in-law (Mr. William Fordyce, who had married his sister) to try the Quayside business, and through whose influence he obtained an appointment in the office of Mr. James Reid, shipbroker and fitter, afterwards connected with Pelton Colliery. On the death of Mr. Reid, which occurred in the year 1848, he obtained the appointment of fitter to the Pelton Colliery, and in the course of a few years became one of the pro prietors, and accumulated a large amount of money. His family connexions were one brother (his senior), who practised as a surgeon at Ovingham, Tyneside, and died there, having married a Miss Crawford, of Warden, near Hexham. He also had two sisters and one step-sister, his mother having married a second time. One of the sisters died unmarried, the younger one, Mary, married Mr. William Fordyce, and left one daughter, who married Mr. William i i"], [312, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. 274 White ; and, at her death, which took place December, 1872, left five children, the youngest of whom died in 1873.

Lady and gentlemen visitors were present from all parts of the district. Every arrangement had been made, under]"], [315, "A.D. 1874.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 277 the direction of the firm, for their comfort. The raised garden in front of the manager's residence \u2014 a spot commanding a full length view of the ship \u2014 was kindly thrown open for the occasion. Gang ways were also erected in convenient positions, so that the whole of the visitors had an opportunity of witnessing the launch to advan tage. Half-past three o'clock was the time fixed, and shortly after that hour the signal was given. Imperceptibly almost the vessel began to slip from the ways, and as her bow left the gangway occupied by Mrs. Siemens, of London, and a party of friends, she was named the \" Faraday\" by that lady, who completed the cere mony by sacrificing the customary bottle of wine. The giant structure slid gently down the incline, and dipped easily into the water amidst the cheers of the sightseers. By means of an im mense cable chain attached to anchors firmly embedded in the ground, she was brought up in midchannel, and was taken in hand by a number of tugs and towed up the river. The launch was of the most successful character, everything passing off without a hitch. The vessel was built to the order of Messrs. Siemens Bro thers, London, for the purpose of laying Atlantic cables. February 23. \u2014 This evening, between nine and ten o'clock, a destructive fire broke out in the engine works of Mr. J. P. Bennold son, engineer, Wapping Street, South Shields, by which great de struction to machinery and material was occasioned. March 17. \u2014 Died at Cannes, in the south of France, Mr. John Candlish, at one time M.P. for Sunderland. He was born at Bel lingham, Northumberland, in the year 1S16, and was therefore 58 years of age at the time of* his death. His parents who belonged originally to the South of Scotland, were in very humble circum stances, his father being a farmer in the North Tyne district. His mother died while John was quite young, and found a grave among the rude forefathers of their native hamlet in Bellingham Church yard. The father appears to have been attracted by the prospect of more lucrative employment in a manufacturing town, and through the influence of his brother, who had settled at Ayre's Quay, Sun derland, and was in comfortable circumstances as the manager of Pemberton's bottle works, he migrated to that place and became a labourer iu the works. John, who bore his father's name, had also to follow his fortunes. He was then only four or five years of age. After as much schooling as his father could give him in one of the humble academies of the neighbourhood, in which characteristically enough, John Candlish became the best scholar in the school, especially as to figures, in which he got as far as equations in algebra, he was sent at the early age of eleven to labour in the bottle works, and add to the scanty income of the family. In his later years be was not a little proud of his humble origin and early priva tions and so far from desiring to conceal the conditions of his early life be never failed when addressing the children of a ragged school to point out bis career as an example of what diligence and energy"], [316, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. 278 might accomplish, and how the path to success was open to all who would follow the Scriptural injunction \" Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.\" He was (he would say) as much a working man as anybody well could be, for his father never had more than 14s. a week in the shape of wages until his son attained to man's estate. Through the influence of his uncle, John Candlish was subsequently taken from the bottle works to be apprenticed to the drapery business, and, along with Mr. J. H. Wake, he served his time in the shop of Mr. Tate, opposite the Exchange, in High Street. His apprenticeship ended, he commenced business as a draper along with Mr. T. B. Wilson, afterwards the assistant overseer and rate collector for Bishopwearmouth. But the restless energy of his nature did not long brook the unedifying routine of a drapers shop, and surrendering the yard-wand to his partner he took up the pen of a newspaper editor by entering with a person named Bichmond, on the proprietorship of the Sunderland Beacon, a Conservative newspaper, first printed in 1838, by Mr. John Kitching, but which was a signal failure. After his rude awakening from the dream of newspaper influence and proprietor- ship, Mr. Candlish entered into partnership with Mr. John Den- niston as a shipbroker and shipowner, but after a short trial of this in an office in Bridge Street, and a subsequent unsuccessful trial of ship-building at touthwick, under the auspices of the late Mr. William Hay, he abandoned these enterprises, and became secretary to the Sunderland Gas Company, in which official position he dis- played much energy and skill in the direction of the company's financial and business affairs. He resigned this post to enter on a partnership in some glass works in Trimdon Street, but soon after- wards bought a small bottle manufacturing establishment at Seaham Harbour, and converted it into the extensive concern known as the Londonderry Bottle Works. This step proved the great turning point in his commercial career, for out of these works he realised a large fortune. Some years after he purchased at Sunder land the Diamond Hall estate, and the bottle works thereon, so that his business as a bottle manufacturer became of a very extensive character. Small vessels were constantly employed in carrying cargoes of bottles to his London warehouses, whence they were dispersed all over the world. He used to relate that when on his expedition to India, in connection with the Abyssinian inquiry, he stopped at a lonely station while on a night journey across the country, and was served with British beer in a bottle of his own manufacture. His success as a bottle manufacturer led to his becoming also an extensive shipowner, in partnership with Mr. Balph Milbanke Hudson, in connection with whom he also pur chased a tract of land at New Hendon, and founded thereon works for the manufacture of spelter. His remains were interred in the Sunderland Cemetery, Byhope Boad, on the 25th, amid the most profound demonstrations of regret and esteem on the part of the fellow-townspeople of the deceased."], [317, "A.D. 1874.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 279 March 31. \u2014 The Queen directed letters patent to be passed under the Great Seal granting the dignities of Baron and Earl of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland unto Henry Thomas, Baron Bavensworth, and the heirs male of his body lawfully be gotten, by the names, styles, and titles of Baron Eslington, of Es lington Park, in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Bavens worth, of Bavensworth Castle, in the County Palatine of Durham. April 5. \u2014 South Shields lost one its oldest and most respected inhabitants in the death of Mr. Aid. George Potts. Although the deceased gentleman was in his 74th year, the news of his death came quite unexpectedly upon his friend s and the public, for up to the last almost he was in the full possession of his faculties, and the day before his death Mr. Potts was in his office, which was in the front room of his residence, transacting business until about noon, when not feeling very well he retired to his sitting room behind the office. After sitting in his easy chair for a short time, and not feeling easier, he retired to his bedroom, and in the course of the afternoon was attended by his medical adviser. During the night he slept pretty well, but on the following morning those arouud him saw he was gradually getting weaker, and about nine o'clock at night he passed quietly away. Mr. Potts was boru on the 9th January, 1781, in Thrift Street, where his father, Mr. Thomas Potts, carried on the business of a butcher. By profession, deceased was a notary public, having served his articles with Mr. Blagburn, of South Shields. As a j'oung man; he commenced to evince an interest in public movements, his first step being to join the South Shields Loyal Volunteers \u2014 then commanded by Lieut.- Colonel Sir Cuthbert Heron \u2014 as a private ; but so assiduous was he in the discharge of his military duties in those troublous times, that be was soon promoted to be an officer. While acting as an ensign, he had the colours of the corps entrusted to his care. The colours were presented to the South Shields Corporation by Mrs. Lockey Harle, the grand-daughter of Sir Cuthbert Heron. In the early history of Shields Mr. Potts took an activo part, and for many years previous to the Incorporation of the borough, he was one of the Improvement Commissioners, in which capacity he took a lively interest in sundry endeavours to supply the town with au abundance of good, wholesome water. On the 3rd of September, 1850, South Shields was incorporated, and Mr. Potts was elected one of the first members of the Corporation, and was also chosen among the first batch of alderman. Iu 1852, he was elected Mayor, the duties of which he ably discharged. The following year, when acting as deputy Mayor to Mr. John Bobinson, tben Mayor, Mr. Potts as sisted Sir Joseph Cowen, chairman of the Eiver Tyne Com mission, to lay the foundation stone of the South Pier at the mouth ofthe Tyne. In 1851 a commission of the peace for the borough was obtained, and Mr. Potts was appointed one ofthe magistrates, the duties of which office he faithfully discharged up to within a very few years of bis death, and on frequent occasions his knowledge"], [318, "280 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. of the law was of great service ; aud in dealing with the ordinary cases of the court, his kindly nature always led him to temper justice with mercy. Deceased was a Liberal in politics, and during the time Mr. Bobert Ingham, Q.C., represented the borough in Parliament, Mr. Potts acted as his agent. He was the oldest Freemason, and was a frequent attender for years at the St. Hilda Lodge South Shields, and as Worshipful Master of the lodge he laid the foundation stone of the Freemason's Hall, Fowler Street, South Shields. May 14. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Eldon Square, Newcastle-upon- Tyne, Dr. E. Charlton. Devoting himself to the study of medicine, the deceased took the degree of M.D., Edinburgh, in 1836, and he entered upou the practice of that science in Newcastle, in which he subsequently acquired so high a reputation, being acknowledged to be one of the leading medical men in the North of England. In 1856, he received the degree of M.D. in connection with Durham University ; and in 1870 he acquired the degree of D.C.L. On the establishment of the College of Medicine in Newcastle, under the auspices of Durham University, he took a warm interest in that institution, being appointed one of the Professors. He was also senior physician to the Infirmary, and was an honorary member of the Boyal Swedish Academy of Medicine, Stockholm. On the occasion of the Thirty-eighth Conference of the British Medical Association, held in Newcastle in 1870, Dr. Charlton occupied the position of President. In addition to being industrious in his profession, Dr. Charlton greatly distinguished himself on other branches of literature and science. He was an enthusiastic naturalist and took much interest in the proceedings of the Natural History Society and the Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club, of. which he was in 1863 president. He was also a prominent member of the New castle Society of Antiquaries, and for many years officiated as joint secretary with Dr. Bruce. To its proceedings he was also a frequent and valuable contributor, many of the papers which he read having acquired more than a local fame. Of his miscellaneous works, the principal was \" Memorials of North Tynedale,\" which was so popular that a second edition was issued. Many other pamphlets, however, he published, which contained much useful and interesting information of an arch\u00e6ological character, among these being \" Early German Versions of the Bible,\" \"Ancient Vases from Malta,\" \" Ecclesiastical Vestments,\" \" Jacobite Belies, 1715 and 1745,\" and \"The Orkney Bunes.'1 About the last paper he read before the Society of Antiquaries was \" Northumbrian Life in the Last Century,\" giving an interesting account of the Delaval family, and which he subsequently read before a large audience at the Literary and Philosophical Society in an amplified form the winter preceding his death.

Dr. Butherford by the members of his church and congregation, in"], [319, "A.D. 1874.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 281 the Bath Lane School-room, Newcastle-on-Tyne. For a quarter of a century Dr. Butherford had ministered with indefatigable zeal in that town, and throughout the whole of that time his untiring energy in all works calculated to promote the social aud moral well-being of bis fellow-men, had gained for him the regard and esteem of his congregation. The idea of commemorating the 25th year of the rev. gentleman's ministry was no sooner mooted than practical action was the result. Liberal subscriptions were made, and though the movement was strictly confined to the members of the congregation of the Bath Lane Church, there were soon ample funds at the command of the committee appointed to make all arrangements connected with the presentation, The testimonial consisted of a massively-framed address, a valuable time-piece, a silver tea and coffee service in the Grecian style, hand engraved, and an elegant plain and frosted silver epergne. At the head of the address was an excellent portrait of Dr. Butherford, at each side his monogram, and at the foot a view of Bath Lane Church.

Her Ladyship was Frances Vere, eldest daughter of Sir William Loraine, Bart., of Kirkharle, Northumberland, (who died in 1 809), by his second wife, Frances, daughter and sole heiress of Francis Campart, Esq., of Kensington. She was first married, in 1829, to William Henry Ord, Esq., M.P,, only son of William Ord, Esq., of Whitfield Hall, Haydon Bridge, Northumberland ; and secondly, on the 16th October, 1851, to Sir Edward Blackest, Bart., of Matfen Hall, in the same county.

According to Debrett, the English branch of the Loraine family, to which Lady Blackest belonged, was founded by Bobert de Lorraine, a companion of William the Conqueror, who rewarded him with lands at East and West Harraton and Ufferton, in the county of Durham. Here his descendants lived until the reign of Henry V., when Edward Lorraine married (about 1416) Johanna, coheiress of William del Strother, Lord of Lyham ; and, obtaining with her the estates of Kirkharle Tower, in Northumberland, removed thither. There his descendants lived for nearly 420 years. June 11.\u2014 The two members for the city of Durham (Mr. J. Henderson and Mr. T. L.

June 25. \u2014 An accident, by which one man was killed and another injured, occurred at Lemington, near Newcastle, during a severe thunderstorm which passed over this district. The circumstances of the occurrence were of an extraordinary character. Alexander Brewis, a keelman, and a man named Bobson, were observed leaving the Old Lemington Staith, where they were employed. They had proceeded a few steps from the waggon way, when a vivid flash of lightning, followed by an exceedingly loud peal of thunder, was experienced. It was then seen by some workmen near that the two men had been struck. They ran to the spot, and Brewis was picked up dead. From his right temple down to the jaw was a mark having the appearance of a gun shot wound, the skin being grazed and torn so as to disclose the raw flesh. The breast was also much burnt. The cloth cap which he had worn was completely shredded, not a half-inch of the material remaining entire. De ceased's comrade, on being picked up, was found to be in an insensible state. Medical aid was at once sent for. Bestoratives were applied, and Bobson with considerable difficulty was restored to consciousness. But both his arms had been paralysed by the severity of the shock he had sustained, and for forty-eight hours after the accident he still remained in a dazed condition. When questioned he could give no account of the occurrence beyond the fact that he was walking close by the side of Brewis the moment before he was struck. The men, when seen by the workmen, were lying about thirty feet apart \u2014 Bobson having been flung with great force to that distance. July 3. \u2014 Died, at Melrose, William Southern, timber merchant, of Newcastle on-Tyne, at the age of 56 years. For a number of years he was connected with the Floral and Horticultural Society of the above district, and for some time a member of the Town Coun cil ; and his great capabilities as a merchant, and his happy genial disposition, made him highly esteemed by all who bad the pleasure of his acquaintance. July 8. \u2014 The Bev. Edward James Midgley, Vicar of Medomsley, in the county of Durham, went to stay with his nephew at Sur biton, Surrey, in order that he might attend the Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace. On making preparations for bis return borne be became greatly excited and flurried ; and, whilst on the road to the station, dropped down dead. At a coroner's inqui-"], [321, "A.D. 1874.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 283 sition afterwards held it was proved that the rev. gentleman had died of heart disease, and a verdict to that effect was returned. The deceased gentleman was 71 years of age. July 15. \u2014 This afternoon, an incident of a most painful and exciting nature occurred at Finchale Abbey, resulting in the loss of one life, and the narrow escape of a second person. A pic-nic had been organised from Trimdon, and amongst the company were two young men, named William John Penman, the son of a Gateshead tradesman, and who was assistant to his uncle, a grocer, &c., at Trimdon, and Thomas Hunter, also belonging to the latter place, who both bathed in the river, entirely ignorant of the deep holes to be encountered in the beds of rivers in whose vicinity there are pit workirgs. Hunter stepped into a deep place, and his com panion at once went to his assistance. Penman had nearly reached Hunter when he stepped into deep water, and being no swimmer, the large crowds on the banks were horrified to see the disaster intensified, without being able to render them any assistance. Hunter fortunately got into a comparatively shallow place, and succeeded in wading ashore. Penman was drowned before assist ance could be rendered. July 16. \u2014 This evening, whilst a number of workmen were riding \" out-bye\" ou a set of tubs at the Adelaide Colliery, near Bishop Auckland, one of the tubs containing two boys, named James Fowler and Thomas Vickers, \" ended up,\" and killed them. July 24. \u2014 A plumber, named Bowe, of Hartlepool, had been engaged to repair a leaden pipe, near the bottom of an earth-sided well, some 3' 'ft. deep, on a farm at Thorpe Bulmer, near West Hartlepool. Two ladders were used to effect the descent, and when the work was completed, about noon, Bowe called to the owner to enter the well and inspect it. Just as the owner was about to comply, the sides of the well gave way, and completely filled it with loose earth. Eight experienced sinkers, provided with the nectssary appliances, hastened to the spot. They worked on till nearly midnight, when they found Bowe, firmly embedded to the hips in the soil and water, his head being protected by a heavy beam of old timber near the bottom. He was in a terribly exhausted state, and quite insensible. Medical aid was sent from West Hartlepool, and Bowe's life was placed beyond danger in about three hours, during which period he was quite delirious. It is calculated that no less than twenty tons of soil were in the well, above the man's head, aud had not the beam alluded to been a very stout one, he must have been killed. July 25. \u2014 This morning, Mr. T. Hurst, commercial manager and publisher of the North and South Shields Gazette newspaper, was drowned while bathing about midway along the south side of the South Shields pier. About seven o'clock, Mr. Hurst, accompanied by Mr. E.' Stanford, bank clerk, aud Mr. H. Todd, clerk, were bathing off the sands, and while endeavouring to swim a bttle, the"], [322, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. 284 deceased found he was in a current and the backwash was carrying him out to sea, and becoming alarmed he cried out for assistance, when Mr. Stanford went towards him and got bold of bis hand. After trying for some time, Stanford was obliged to leave go of Hurst, who appeared to be sinking. Stanford made another attempt to save his friend by getting bold of his head, but, finding it impos sible to extricate him from the current, had to leave hold again, and it was with great difficulty that Stanford, who was then exhausted, reached the shore, and when he did so he was very nearly gone himself. Mr. Todd happened to be too far away to render any assistance, Hurst being out of sight before he was aware anything was wrong. July 30. \u2014 A bazaar to raise funds to enable the United Presby terian congregation to restore and beautify their church, was held at Chatton. The bazaar was held in a marquee, which was beauti fully decorated with cut and other flowers, erected in the grounds of the Bev. David Young, near the manse. There were five stalls, covered with a profusion of useful and ornamented work, tastefully displayed, for sale. Dr. Marshall opened the bazaar. At the con clusion, the contents of the various tills having been counted, showed that the very satisfactory total of about \u00a3250 had been realised by the day's sale. An excellent luncheon was provided in a tent adjoining. Amongst the company present were the Countess Tankerville and Ladies Bennet, Chillingham Castle ; Mrs Culley and party, Fo wherry Tower ; Dr. and Mrs. Marshall and party, Chatton Park House; the Bev. H. and Mrs. Bell, Vicarage, Chatton; Miss Hudson, Chillingham Vicarage ; Mr. George Grey and Mr. Grey, Milfield, &c. August 11. \u2014 A man named Stephen Brewster, aged 60, accom panied by his son Thomas, aged 28, proceeded in a coble from Sunderland to fish off the harbour, and when about half a mile off Boker shore the boat was, by some means or other, capsized and both men submerged. After struggling for some time the two managed to right the boat and get into her ; but a second time the boat \" went from under their feet,\" and they were struggling in the water. The younger man succeeded in seizing the keel of the craft and clinging to it, whilst the father floated about a few yards off. After a short time had elapsed the father was compelled to give up his efforts and sank in sight of his son. August 16. \u2014 A man named James Kelly, belonging to South Shields, was sitting on the cliffs at the Two-gun Battery, over looking the Long Sands, Tynemouth, when a gust of wind blew his hat off down a sloping part of the banks. He jumped up and ran after it, but he got too much momentum, and the result was that be precipitated himself over the cliffs, falling on to the sands below with frightful violence. He was picked up in a terribly injured and unconscious state, and died shortly afterwards."], [323, "a.d. 1874.] remarkable events. 285 August 22. \u2014 Between nine and ten o'clock this evening, an alarming and destructive fire was observed to have broken out in the premises belonging to Messrs W. H. and A Bichardson, paper manufacturers, Jarrow. The flames were seen issuing from an uppermost loft, in which Esparto grass was prepared for paper making, and which loft was situated at the extreme part of the buildings where paper was finished and temporarily stored. The Esparto grass being of a combustible nature, the flames spread rapidly, and soon bursting through the roof communicated with all parts of the buildings, which quickly became a huge and dense mass of fire and smoke. The water supply was rather deficient, and the fire could not be subdued until several thousand pounds of damage had been done to the buildings and the stock, the total being estimated at between \u00a325,000 and and \u00a330,000. August 24. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Sandyford Lane, Newcastle on-Tyne, Mr. Matthew Liddell, aged 69 years. He was born in Newcastle, In his youth he was passionately fond of music, de voting himself chiefly to the study of the clarionet, upon which instrument he became a most, expert player. After the death of Totton, a well-known clarionet player and leader of bands, he got several bands in the counties of Northumberland and Durham to teach, and while he occupied this position he acquired some celebrity as an instructor. About the year 1835 he was appointed leader of the Newcastle and Northumberland Yeomanry Band, a position which he held uninterruptedly until his death. August 25. \u2014 A bazaar and fine art exhibition in aid of a fund for restoring the tower of St. Mary's Church, Barnard Castle, was held in that town. Mr. B. A. Morritt, of Bokeby Hall, accompanied by the Bight Hod. T. E. Headlam, formally opened the exhibition in a brief and humorous address. Among the objects of art was a rare portrait of Wycliffe, the Eeformer, by Sir Antonio More. There was also a collection of paintings by Harrison Weir, valued at 900 guineas, the property of Mr. F. A. Milbank, M.P., the sub jects being illustrations of field sports ; and a fine picture of the opening ofthe Stockton and Darlington Bail way, lent by Mr. H. Pease. The great object of admiration, however, was the picture of a Venus and Cupid, by Vandyke, and also the Crucifixion, by the same artist. Amongst the curiosities exhibited was an original letter penned by Eugene Aram, after his condemnation in York Castle, and a Papal bull found in Kirby Bavensworth Churchyard, bearing the seal of Pope Honorius. There was also shown a fine collection of gold and silver plate and heirlooms from Streatlam Castle. August 27.\u2014 A number of ladies and gentlemen met for luncheon at the btella Staith Inn, to present Addison Potter, Esq., the senior partner in the Stella Coal Company, with his portrait as Mayor of Newcastle, and Mrs. Potter with a tiara of diamonds.

The likeness in every respect was admirable, the artist having happily caught the expression of face in its most natural mood. At the foot of the frame was the following inscription: \u2014 \"Presented to Addison Potter, Esq., as Mayor of Newcastle, by his Co-partners in the Stella Coal Company. .August, 1874.\" Luncheon was served in the long room, Mr. Buddie Atkinson in the chair.

In response to the toast of \" Her Majesty's Ministers,\" and in the course of a lengthy speech, the Eight Hon. G. Ward Hunt said : \u2014 \" 1 cannot help alluding to the sight which I have witnessed to-day. It is the first time that I have been on the Tyne, and by the kindness of gentlemen in this place I was conducted from here up to Newcastle, and I must say that much as I had heard of the industry and enterprise of this part of the world my expectations were far exceeded. It seems to me that in going up this river one was realising the ancient fable of Pactolus, which was said to flow in a tide of gold \u2014 metaphorically, of course, I am speaking. It seems to me that the Tyne bears on its bosom such a flood of wealth that it equals those magic tales which the ancients were fond of dreaming of the Golden Pactolus. But in viewing such marvellous enterprise, and such varied industry, as is exhibited on this noble river, I must say that one feels at the same time a greater sense of responsibility in holding a post of importance in the Government of the day ; because one cannot help thinking how any mistake that may be made by the Government and its policy may affect largely vast interests \u2014 may affect largely those teeming multitudes which thrive by the industry which is exhibited on tbe banks of such a river as this ; and I say that such a thought will make one doubly anxious and doubly careful, and weigh every act and every decision which one may have to form. It is with these feelings that I have risen to return thanks for the toast which had been so kindly proposed and so warmly received ; and I can assure you, on the part of myself and my colleagues, that we feel the greatest, and that you have done us the very greatest honour in drinking our health in the way that you have done ; and I am sure that in this expression of your confidence and of your generous appreciation of our motives, we shall feel a double anxiety to dis charge, to tbe best of our powers, the duties that are imposed upon us. September 7. \u2014 The foundation stone of a new Temperance Church was laid in Stephenson Street, North Shields, by Mr. T. E. Smith, M.P. Tbe church, which has a distinctive temperance character,"], [326, "286 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1874. had worshipped for some time in Broadbent Hall under the pas torate of the Bev. H. V. Williams. It was largely composed of working people as members. The old hall was found to be too limited for its sphere of operations in dealing with the seafaring population, and the members of the church, with the assistance of sympathisers with the temperance section of the working classes, purchased a suitable site for the new building at the head of Stephenson Street. The new chapel will seat between six and eight hundred persons ; and there is room for extensions. Amongst the gentlemen who accompanied Mr. Smith, M.P., on to the platform were the Mayor of Gateshead, Mr. Aid. Spence, Mr. Henry Taylor (chairman of the Congregational Association of Nor thumberland and Durham), Professor Kirk, Edinburgh ; the Eev. Mr. Ellis, the Eev. D. Tasker, the Eev. H. Hallam, the Eev.

September 8. \u2014 Au accident of a somewhat serious nature occur red to Sir Henry Clavering, of Axwell Park. Sir Henry and a friend left Axwell Park in a tandem and pair for the purpose of proceeding to Greencroft Park, the seat of his brother, Mr. John Clavering, where they were to meet a party of friends for a day's shooting. Sir Henry was also accompanied by the coachman and a youth named Woodman. They proceeded without mishap until reaching the village of Hare Law, about four miles from Consett, where the pole of the tandem slipped out. The weight of the con veyance was at once thrown on the traces attached to the \" swingle-trees,\" and this caused the horses to plunge violently. After going a short distance the swingle-trees snapped, and the occupants of the conveyance were thrown to the ground. Sir Henry received some serious contusions, and for a time it was thought that one of his legs had been fractured. Assistance was soon at hand, and he was carried to the house of a blacksmith. Sir Henry's friend was much shaken. The coachmau received several ugly cuts about the head, and the lad Woodman was also much bruised. September 8. \u2014 A sinker named John Alderson, whilst engaged in his occupation at a new colliery at Deckham Hall, near Gateshead, filled three holes with powder to blast, and was then drawn to bank. Two of the shots went off, but the third did not, and after waiting some time he descended to ascertain the cause Whilst engaged in drilling the shot out again it exploded, from tbe effects of which Alderson received such injuries as to cause his death. September 10. \u2014 The remains of John Trotter, a Peninsular veteran, were interred in Norton churchyard. Tbe deceased had"], [327, "A.D. 1874. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 287 attained the ripe age of 88 years. When a boy he was postilion for Lady Vane Tempest, of Wynyard Hall, and subsequently was engaged to an army officer at York, where he enlisted in the year 1803 in the 32nd Eegiment of Foot, and they were shortly ordered off to Spain. He was present in the several engagements connected with the Peninsular war, and at the death of Sir John Moore, at the battle of Corunna. He was also present at the battle of Water loo, where he was wounded in the left arm. In two other engage ments he had narrow escapes, being once hit with a ball on his breastplate, and at another time his cap was shot from his head. After Waterloo he got a blank discharge and a medal, and returned after twelve years' hard service to the village of Norton, where he was born, and had been in the receipt of a pension for some time. When the Victoria medals were struck in 1S48 the veteran had one presented to him, with the inscriptions, \" Toulouse, Pyrenees, Salamanca, Corunna, and Vimeria,\" on the reverse side. It was a pleasure to the old man to recount the dangers of fighting and tbe hardships of a soldier's life, but more especially so to his family. In accordance with the expressed desire of the deceased, the 1st Durham Eifle Volunteers (Stockton) attended the funeral ; and he was buried with military honours in the churchyard of his native village. September 14. \u2014 Died, Mrs. J. Blackwell, of Newcastle-on-Tyne. The melancholy event took place at Tynemouth, where for some time the deceased lady had been staying for her health. Mrs. Blackwell was well known, and always took an active and zealous part in connection with many of the charitable and philanthropic institutions of the town and district ; but especially is her name associated with the Infirmary Chaplaincy, which she generously founded and endowed about the beginning of the year 1860, a cor dial vote of thanks being awarded to her for her handsome offer on the occasion of its acceptance. Not only was she a liberal contri butor to local objects of benevolence, but by her frequent personal attendance she manifested her interest in the practical details of the charities with which she identified herself. The deceased lady, as relict of Dr. Tulloch, was married to Mr Aid. Blackwell, in Sep tember, 1860, during tbe mayoralty of that gentleman, whom she survived little more than two years. September 1 5. \u2014 The Channel Fleet, under the command of Bear- Admiral Geoffrey T. B.

The proceedings passed off quietly. October 9. \u2014 Mr. Bobert Bidley, a gentleman widely known and much respected in Hexham, died at the ripe old age of 85 years. He was about the last of that old race of glove-makers that has made \" Hexham tans\" famous in both hemispheres. His charities to religious societies were generous and unsectarian ; but his chief pleasure was in visiting tbe poorest of the poor, and giving that sympathy and help which were the true outcomes of a Christian spirit. October 19. \u2014 This morning, a fearful occurrence, involving the death of a man, woman, and boy, took place in Clive Street, North Shields. At about two o'clock, two police-constables, who were on duty, observed smoke issuing from a house occupied by a person named Garrett. The house contained, in addition to Garrett and his wife, a man named Baines and his wife, and a boy 12 years of age, named Spoors, son of Mrs. Baines. The police at once endeavoured to rouse the sleeping occupants, but failed to do so. Appliances were procured to assist in the rescue of the people in the burning houses. The Garretts were evidently suffocated and dead, so that no more could be done to reach them ; but the Baines, w ho lived over the tenement which had been occupied by the Gar retts, being aware of their danger, made an effort to escape, and they got out by the adjoining premises and were rescued ; but the poor lad, in attempting to follow, had possibly been overcome with the smoke, and was supposed to have fallen into the fire below, as he was afterwards found burnt to death, while the man and wife were saved in a half conscious state. The fire brigade and hose with the river engine poured water copiously on the fire. Every thing, indeed, was done to keep it back, but the flames shot into the air and burned like a furnace until the premises were com pletely gutted. The bodies of the three unfortunate persons were found amongst the ruins, burnt beyond recognition. October 20. \u2014 Mr. Ealph Dodds, Alderman of the Town Council of Newcastle, and one of the justices of the peace for the borough, died this morning at his residence, Bentinck Terrace, at the advanced age of eighty-two years. Mr. Dodds essentially belonged to the class of self-made men. He was born in Alnwick, his origin being of the most humble description. Owing to tbe poverty of his parents, his early education was much neglected ; and the little learning he managed to acquire was given in exchange for menial services"], [330, "290 HISTORICAL KEGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. rendered to the schoolmaster of the parish. At an early age, he was apprenticed to a plasterer in his native town. Actuated by that spirit of industry and enterprise which did so much to mould bis subsequent career, young Dodds, on the completion of his term of servitude, fixed on Newcastle as the scene of his future labours ; and his advent in that borough was made pretty much in the style of the famous Dick Whittington. Indeed, it is stated that he sat down on a stone at the head of Westgate, not far from the magnifi cent house in which he afterwards so long lived, to look at the strange, inhospitable-looking town, and take stock of nothing but his prospects. How it fared with him is now a matter of history. By his diligence and perseverance he was soon able to enter in business on his own account as a plasterer, and he also engaged largely in building operations. Success steadily smiled upon him, and the application and tact which he displayed in his private affairs were not long in being brought to bear on departments of public usefulness. On the 2nd of November, 1840, he was elected a mem ber of the Town Council, as one of the representatives of North St. Andrew's Ward, in which he succeeded Mr. E. Lowry. The ex perience of the Municipal Eeform Act had then, comparatively speaking, been but brief ; and the practical assistance rendered by Mr. Dodds in connection with several committees, tended in no small degree to the development of the beneficial features of that measure. In due time these services met with their fitting reward. Iu 1850 he was called on to fill the important office of Sheriff, and the duties of the department were discharged to the entire satisfac tion of his colleagues. The next step in the municipal ladder for Mr. Dodds was his elevation to the aldermanic bench on the 20th of February, 1852, as successor to Mr. Aid. Dunn. A still higher honour, however, awaited him, and in 1853-4 he officiated as Chief Magistrate of the borough. Both nationally and locally, the year was a memorable one. At the commencement of his term of office, the town had just recovered from the outbreak of cholera which had committed such dreadful ravages among the population ; and one of his earliest officials acts was to appoint the 16th of November, 1853, as a day of general thanksgiving for the subsidence of the appalling visitation. The occasion was observed with great decorum by the inhabitants, business being entirely suspended throughout the day, while service was held in the churches and many of the dissenting places of worship, and collections were made iu aid ofthe fund for the relief of the sufferers by tbe calamity. In social life, Mr. Dodds was a capital companion. He was the presiding genius of the festive scene, and could keep a good company in a perpetual roar with his fun and merriment. Before business commenced at a committee meeting of the Corporation he would often raise more than a smile on the sly visage of Mr. Clayton, Town Clerk, by relat ing his own last adventures, or by his humorous allusion to the peculiarities of his friends. Indeed, Mr. Dodds never missed an opportunity of making a joke. He bated shams and humbugs, and"], [331, "A.D. 1874.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 291 be never spared them when they came in his way. Towards his native town of Alnwick, Mr. Dodds ever cherished a warm affection, and nothing was more pleasing to him than to visit his birthplace and renew the associations of early days. On these occasions he unostentatiously looked in upon every old acquaintance, and where it could be offered with propriety, the gift stealthily given, showed that his heart was always in the right place. The deceased gentle man was twice married, his second wife having died only about three years before him. October 22. \u2014 The Bev. Joseph Waite, M.A., formerly master of Durham University College, and who was appointed Vicar of Nor ham, was presented by the members of the University and friends with his portrait and a handsome piece of silver plate, as a testi monial of the respect and esteem in which he was held both as a gentleman and as a scholar. The portrait was hung in the Uni versity Hall, where also are displayed the portraits of other distinguished members of the college. The silver plate bears the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented, together with his portrait, to the Bev. J. Waite, M.A., by the members of the University of Dur ham and other friends, on resigning the mastership of the University College and accepting the Vicarage of Norham, as a mark of their appreciation of his long and valuable services as tutor and master, 1874.\" The presentation was made in the University Hall, in the presence of a select company of ladies and gentlemen. The Bev. Canon Cundill occupied the chair, and after briefly stating the pur pose of the gathering, called upon the Bev. Mr. Shafto, Eector of Brancepeth, who made the presentation. In doing so, he remarked that if there was one thing more than another that endeared Mr. Waite to the members of the University, it was that they believed he was loyal to his University ; they admired him for his talents and courtesy ; but they loved him because they trusted him. He had much pleasure, in the name of the subscribers, in ask'ng Mr. Waite's acceptance of the testimonial now before him. The portrait was then unveiled, and its truthfulness to tbe original was at once apparent. \u2014 Mr. Waite, in replying, said he bad been for twenty one years in the service of the University of Durham in various capacities \u2014 as a tutor, as a proctor, as a member of the senate, as master of University College, and as a member of the College of Physical Science and of the Medical College of Newcastle-upon- Tyne. While he was honoured with the distinction they had conferred upon him, that testimonial also reminded him that it implied the cessation of his immediate and daily intercourse from his colleagues and friends in Durham. October 24. \u2014 The remains of Mr. Aid. Dodds were interred in Elswick Cemetery, Newcastle. The funeral, which was intended to be private, could hardly be called such, for it was a very large one, including the members of the Corporation and representatives of other public bodies."], [332, "292 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874. October 28. \u2014 A bazaar in aid of the Improvement Fund of St. Peter's Church, North Shields, was opened by Earl Percy, M.P., in the Albion Assembly Booms of that town. The interior of the building was gorgeously decorated for the occasion. Earl Percy, accompanied by Mr. Jos. Snowball, of Season Burn, was met at the Town Hall by the Mayor of Tynemouth (E. W. Surtees, Esq.) and members of the Corporation, among whom were Aldermen Green, Wascoe, Shotton, and Councillors Hall, Tully, Bell, Miller, and Wilkie.

The Mayor, addressing Earl Percy, said he had, in behalf of the inhabitants of the borough, very great pleasure in welcoming him, especially considering that the object which had brought his lordship amongst them was one of so suitable a nature, namely, to promote the religious prosperity of the town. There was no question whatever that his lordship's predecessors, as well as himself, had at all times taken very great interest in the welfare of the borough, and especially iu its religious institutions.\u2014 Earl Percy said he simpiy thanked them extremely for the very kind expressions they had used towards him, and assured them that it gave him great pleasure to come amongst them, especially, as had been very justly observed, upon an errand which, he trusted, would contribute to the welfare, and, as far as the bazaar was concerned, also to the enjoyment of the borough of Tynemouth. \u2014 Aid. Shotton and Mr. Twizell, in behalf of the St. George's Lodge of Freemasons, also welcomed his lordship, expressing the hope that the brethren might have the pleasure of meeting a member of the house of Percy in the lodge In the course of the afternoon, Earl Percy, accom panied by the Mayor of TyDemouth (Mr. E.

Subsequently he proceeded to Tynemouth, and inspected the piers and other works of the Eiver Tyne Commisioners. At the Sailors' Home his lordship was received by the Mayor, Aid. Shotton, aud Mr. W.

Gilpin, M.P., brother of Mr. Henry Gilpin, of Newcastle-on-Tyne) was passed unanimously at the Committee of the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, on the notices of Mr. Edmond Beales, M.A., seconded by Mr. C. Wise \u2014 \"By the decease of their honoured colleague, Mr Charles Gilpin, M.P, the committee feel that they have sustained a loss, the extent of which it is beyond their power adequately to express. The history ofthe Anti-Capital Punishment movement, for many years past is, in a great degree, a history of the efforts of their lamented friend, than whom no one has laboured more perseveringly or more earnestly to abolish that remnant of inhuman and impolitic legislation \u2014 The Penalty of Death. He was intimately and actively associated with Mr. William Ewart, M P., Mr. John Thomas Barry, and other well known philanthropists, and their great exertions aided greatly in purging the statute book, to a large extent, from the sanguinary stains which formerly dis figured it. Before Mr. Gilpin entered Parliament he undertook, in conjunction with his friend Mr. Thomas Beggs, a principal share in the work of eliciting public opinion in support of the legislative efforts of Mr. Ewart. With thi-i object most of the chief towns of kingdom were visited and re-visited by him and Mr. Beggs in the advocacy of a more humane and merciful penal code. When at length the extreme penalty had become virtually restricted to the single crime of murder, and it was manifest that its entire abolition must necessarily be a labour of very slow and arduous nature, Mr. Gilpin still maintained an unflinching consistency in pleading, both in and out of Parliament, against attempts to suppress this crime by a public example of judicial homicide, nor did he content him self with this, but on many occasions used his influence (and often successfully) in endeavours to induce Secretaries of State to re commend the extension of the Eoyal prerogative of mercy to cases where special circumstances seemed to warrant such interposition. The committee feel that the blessing pronounced upon the merciful was indeed abundantly merited by their departed friend aud col league, who throughout his life ever exemplified a most devoted philanthropy in action as well as in word. While his decease will be deeply regretted by many important organizations and societies, this committee in particular feels that it has thereby sustained an almost irreparable loss ; but its members, while thus sadly conscious of the -blank left in their own body, feel it the more incumbent upon them to tender to Mrs. Gilpin and the family of their honoured friend their profound sympathy under this overwhelming affliction.\""], [334, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1874 294 November 4. \u2014 One of the most interesting ceremonies which had been performed in the quiet old county town of Alnwick for many years took place this day, when a range of new buildings consisting of bath, washhouses, and workmen's institute were formally inaug urated by a visit from His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, through whose munificence they had been built. An address was presented to his Grace, who, in returning thanks, said : \u2014 Gentlemen, I am extremely gratified at the manner in which you have accepted my efforts to be of some benefit to the town of Alnwick. I believe that I have on all occasions proved ready to assist in anything that should be for the benefit of the town and the general welfare of the inhabitants. I am aware that the town is already heavily taxed with rates, and that a larger, heavier burden put upon their shoulders might have proved a very serious annoy ance and iuconveuience to the mass of the inhabitants ; and, therefore, I thought, in doing what I have done, I might be doing something that might be of some advantage to you, and I shall be heartily glad if that turns out to be the case.

The articles were of a very handsome description, and contained 360 ounces of solid silver. The epergne on the first shield bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to R. W.

November 18. \u2014 At a special meeting of the Town Council of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Mr. George Forster was elected an alderman in the room of Alderman Dodds, deceased. Sir Wm.

Charlton, Esq.) in the Central Hall, Hood Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in token of the high esteem in which his wor ship was held by the promoters of the temperance movement in this district. A number of ladies graced the proceedings by their presence. The usual custom of toast-drinking was discarded, and, after the tables had been cleared, resolutions were submitted as at an ordinary meeting. There were between two and three hundred friends present, and the occasion caused considerable stir amongst the temperance body.

His Boyal Highness the Prince of Wales, together with other noblemen and gentlemen, drove to the churchyard gate from Howick Hall, the seat of Earl Grey, whose guest he had been from the previous evening. The Prince, who was in excellent health, seemed to feel very much the loss he had sustained in the death of the gallant colonel, with whom he had been upon terms of the greatest intimacy. The coffin was placed at the entrance to the chancel, and upon it were laid a floral crosss and a wreath of evergreens. The immediate relatives of the deceased occupied front seats, and one of the principal benches was reserved for the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Northumberland, and Earl Grey. The other portions of the sacred building were well filled. Service concluded, Mendelsohn's Dead March in Saul was performed upon the organ. Towards the close of the ceremony the Prince of Wales stepped forward and laid upon the coffin two wreaths of white jessamine, with green foliage, which he had brought from the South. The coffin was lowered and the friends of the family and others passed round to take a last look at the resting- place of the departed. The outer coffin consisted of oak with gilt mountings, within which was a leaden coffin, and within that again a shell containing the body.

He received the rudimentary portion of his education at Harrow School, and was afterwards a member of Trinity College, Cambridge. He entered the army in December, 1854, or January, 1855, joining the Eifle Brigade. During the Crimean War ha went out and was present, among other engagements, at the siege and capture of Se- bastopol. Upon the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny he proceeded to India and served with ths Eifles. He then came home and was appointed one of the equerries to the Prince of Wales.

Daley was a coke drawer at one of the neighbouring collieries, ard returned to his home at High Bushblades, on the 7th of November, in an advanced stage of intoxication. He found the deceased man, Philip Burdy, lying on the floor of his house in an almost helpless condition, and as he did not quit the house when ordered to do so, Daley attacked Burdy with a poker, after pushing him outside After leaving his victim, Burdy crawled into the prisoner's house in search of his cap ; Daley, who had been got to lie down in bed by his wife and a neigh bour, again attacked the man with the poker outside the house, and after leaving him for a few minutes he renewed his blows with the poker on the prostrate form of Burdy, whom he continued lo strike until he was apprehended by P. C. Forster, the whole attack from first to last extending over two hours. Burdy died about an hour and a half after being rescued from the hands of Daley, who was subsequently found guilty of wilful murder at the Durham Winter Gaol Delivery. December 29. \u2014 A very interesting gathering took place in the Central Hall, Darlington. Messrs. Henry Pease and Co., of the Priestgate Mills, in that town, gave a tea party to over 700 of their w orkpeople, in celebration of the opening of their new mills. After tea, Mr. Edward Pease took the chair, and was supported by Mr. J. W. Pease, M.P., Mr. H. F. Pease (Mayor of Darlington), Mr. W. C. Parker, Mr. George Shaw, &c. The proceedings began with the presentation of a very handsome time-piece to Mr. George Shaw, who had been for something like forty years in the employment of the firm of Henry Pease and Co., and of whom the Mayor (Mr. H. F. Pease), in making the presentation, spoke in very eulogistic terms. \u2014 The Chairman then addressed the meeting at some length, and gave some excellent counsel to the young people present, incul cating habits of steadiness and sobriety. \u2014 Mr. J. W. Pease, M.P. , also addressed the meeting. He believed he might fairly call him self the junior partner in the firm of H. Pease and Co. He only came very late in life into the capacity of a millowner, and he believed if be was cross-examined on his knowledge of mill affairs, he should pass a very poor examination indeed, for if be knew the warp from the weft it was about all he knew. His audience had learned a great deal more than he knew about these things. These mills were a somewhat old establishment in Darlington. He had in his room an engraving which sho.wed its date to be 1776, and there was then no house whatevtr beyond what they used to call Bill Hodgson's corner. There was no house beyond Bulmer's Stone iu Northgate. There were no houses on the other side of the Sktrne, gcing on the Stockton Bead, or towards Bank Top Station. Tradition told them- but he believed it was wrong in this as in many other things\u2014 that the first Edward Pcare who entered Darlington rode iu with bis Lundle on his back. It was"], [338, "298 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. no disgrace to an honest man to have done so. They knew that George Stephenson, when he came to make the Stockton and Dar lington Bailway, walked into Darlington with almost less than his bundle on his back ; that Locke, the great engineer, was a Glasgow carter ; that Arkwright was a barber ; and that Eobert Peel's father awoke the inhabitants of Boston early one morning with the sound of his wooden shoes on the pavement. A kind friend had told him a little while ago that one of the first to establish the woollen trade in Darlington was a certain John Coldwell, and he had a nephew called Edward Pease, to whom he left a fortune of \u00a3120 or \u00a3130, and he seemed to have been the first of the Pease family who inherited the woollen business in Darlington. 1875 (January 2).\u2014 K number of the friends of Mr. Bichard Fynes, of Blyth, a gentleman who had for a number of years taken an active interest in the intellectual, political, and social advance ment of the miners of Northumberland, assembled at the Central Hall, Waterloo, Blyth, to pay a worthy tribute to that gentleman. Among the company were Mr. Alexander Blyth, Mr. E. Dellow, Mr. F. Slater, Mr. Hugh Dellow, Newcastle ; Mr. Thos. Gascoigne, Dudley ; Mr. John Bennett, Mr. Alexander Bolton, Mr. Joseph Simm, Mr. Thos. Simm, Mr. G. Fryer, Cramlington ; Mr. C. Has well, Bedlington; Mr. Robert Wilkinson, Netherton ; Mr. W. Grieves, late of Cleveland ; Mr. Dixon Weatherley, Burradon ; Mr. Wood, Seghill ; Bev. W.

After a substantial repast had been partaken of, Mr. J. E. Forster was unanimously called to the chair, and Mr. E. Bell to vice-chair. Mr. Gascoigne read a letter from Mr. Hugh Taylor, at Bournemouth, enclosing a cheque for \u00a310, and expressing his kind regard for Mr. Fynes, and his regret at not having the happiness to present the plate to him. \u2014 The Chairman, in making the presen tation, said they had met to do honour to a gentleman who, by his own intrinsic merit and business abilities, had become an important tradesman of the district. He was glad to see Mr. Fynes sur rounded by so many friends to do honour to him. Mr. Blyth then referred to each of the various movements with which Mr. Fynes had been connected. He first alluded to his connection with the Cramlington Co-operative Store, his efforts on behalf of the intro duction of the two-shaft system as the result of the Hartley catas trophe, and the part he had taken in the establishment of the Miner's Permanent Belief Fund, which now comprised 270 collieries and 46,000 members. Mr. Blyth then referred to the kterary abilities of Mr. Fynes, concluding by presenting to that gentleman, on their behalf, a handsomely-bound copy of Cassell's Illustrated Shakspeare, in three volumes ; a silver service, of the value of \u00a345 ; and an elegant address. He hoped Mr. Fynes would long be spared to look upon the articles, which would show to his friends in future that he had been respected by his friends in the past. Mr. Blyth"], [339, "A.D. 1875 J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 299 presented the testimonial amid loud cheering. \u2014 The address ex pressed the desire of Mr. Fynes' friends rather to honour him for his manly qualities than to congratulate him upon his success in business, aud declared that he had ever had the goodwill of his fellow men, and that those who had known him the longest loved and admired him the most. January 2. \u2014 About five o'clock this afternoon, the residents at the higher end of the North Boad, at Durham, were alarmed by a heavy explosion of gas, which took place at the shop of a Mr. William Gray, tailor and draper. Durirg the Saturday Mr. Gray bad been somewhat alarmed by the strong smell of gas escaping somewhere ou his premises, and he accordingly sent a message to the Gas Company's offices, on Framwellgate Bridge, for some one to look to the pipes and stop the leakage. A workman is stated to have been despatched for that purpose, but he, after making some investigations, intimated that it was not necessary to do anything to the pipes until Monday morning. During the latter part of the afternoon the escape was so strong that Mr. Gray did not light the gas in his shop, and a few minutes after five o'clock he lighted a candle and proceeded to search for the seat of the leakage. The smell did not appear to come from the ordinary gas pipes ofthe shop but from the boards of the floor, and to those Mr. Gay proceeded to devote his attention, the only others in the shop being two of his children, aged 4| years and 2-^ years. His wife had been confined some seven or eight days previous, and was at that moment in a room over the shop. Mr Gray had pushed his investigations to the party wall which divided his shop from the front room of a house at the corner of Atherton Street, when suddenly a loud explosion of gas blew him into the window of his shop, Stunned for a moment, he recovered enough consciousness to crawl through the opening thus caused, but he almost immediately afterwards became uncon scious. Only a few persons were about when the expl sii n occurred, and many of those on seeing the window fall bodily over into the street, and on hearing the loud report, fled dowu the road, or rushed into the neighbouring houses for safety. A few, however, saw Mr. Gray make his appearance through the window, his face covered with blood, and they at once carried him up to the Durham County Hospital, which is close to the scene of the accident. The next business was the rescue of those within the house. Mr. Gray's family consisted of his wife, the infant referred to, a little girl, two boys, and a servant girl. The latter had gone upon an errand before the accident, whilst his daughter was fortunately absent from home on a visit to some friends. Some of the goods in the shop had been set on fire by the explosion, but the flames were very easily extinguished. A seaich was at once set on foot, for the inmates, when the elder of the two boys, was found half buried amongst the ruins. He appeared to be quite dead, although in the hurried inspection that was made of him as he was handed out little or no injury could be seen on him. The younger child, who"], [340, "300 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1872. was discovered immediately afterwards, seemed a much worse case' his face been covered with blood, and his limbs, had apparently received seme injury. The next step of those who had enteiedthe shop was to rescue Mrs. Gray from the upstairs room. The party made their way towards the stairs, but the darkness and the heaps of wreck that obstructed the passage suggested to one of them the ad- visability of having a light, and be accordingly struck a' light. Immediately on this a second explosion occurred, causing many of the party to beat a retreat from the place. One of those in the front \u2014 a Mr Hauxwell \u2014 however, waited until the effects of the explosion had subsided, and then, making his way upstairs into the bedroom, he lifted Mrs Gray and her infant out of bed and carried her down stairs, wheie he was joined by others, amongst whom she was carried to a house adjoining. Mr. Summers, the secretary to the Gas Company, on learning the fact ofthe accident, at once pro- ceeded to the shop of Mr. Gray, and an investigation was commenced with a view of ascertaining where the leakage was. About seven o'clock Mr. Summers and a workmen named Smurthwaite descended into the cellar underneath the house of a Mrs. Martin, which was situated at the lower corner of Atherton Street, opposite to that of Mr. Gowland,, their light being a safety lamp. Mr. Summers in- cautiously struck a match, when an explosion occurred, the noise of which was heard in the front .street. Mr. Summers and his com- panion succeeded in reaching tbe ground floor, and were assisted out of the building. Both had received contusions about the face and head, and were much shaken, although neither of them was seriously injured. Mr. Summers was assisted to his home on Western Hill, where his injuries were dressed, while Smurthwaite proceeded to the Durham County Hospital, where his wounds re- ceived treatment, and he was then able to walk to bis home. The shop of Mr Gray was a complete wreck, the windows being entirely blown out, both upstairs and down, the fittings toin down, and the stock destroyed. Next door the house and furniture of Mr. Gow- land had also sustained very considerable injury, and the smell of gas in both these places was so strong as to make it undesirable for any one to occupy them. The third explosion had inflicted consider- able injury on the house of Mrs Martin, while the windows of some of the adjoining houses had sustained a great amount of damage. Both the children died from the effects of the explosion, and at a Coroners inquest the jury returned the following verdict : \u2014 \"That the deaths of Bobert Gray and Henry Clark Gray were caused by an explosion of gas which escaped from a fracture in a main pipe belonging to the Durham Gas Company. The jury further believed that the fact of a considerable escape of gas taking place had, previous to the explosion, come to the knowledge of Benjamin Arkless, foreman, and John Summers, secretary of the Gas Company, and they are strongly of opinion that if prompt and decisive measures bad been adopted the explosion might have been averted. The jury are also of opiiJ..i* that tho safety of iht \u00b1i_______e"], [341, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 301 would be greatly promote! by the Durham Gas Company providing, in the principal streets of the city, stop valves in connection with their mains.\" January 5. \u2014 A boat accident took place on the river Tyne, near Blaydon, owing to the heavy fresh and quantity of ice coming down the river, when 9 persons were drowned. January 6. \u2014 A terrible boiler explosion occurred at the works of Messrs. Pow and Fawcus, Bull Biug, North Shields, by which seven men were hurried into eternity. The cause ofthe accident, as elicited at the inquest, was through overheating the boiler, which was old and much weakened by repairs. January 27. \u2014 The inhabitants of Seaham and district committed to their last resting place, in the parish burial ground, the remains of Capt. D. Mann, of the 2nd Durham (Seaham) Artillery Volunteers, who died at the age of 51, at his residence, Cliff House, Seaham, after a brief illness. The Artillery Volunteers, to the number of 350, mustered at the Seaham Drill Shed, and marched to the deceased's residence, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel the Marquis of Londonderry. The body of the deceased was placed upon a gun carriage, drawn by six black horses, the deceased's sword, belts, and busby were placed upon the coffin, and the pro cession marched off in the following order: \u2014 Firing party of 100 gunners, under the command of Captain Hardy, Volunteers' band, under the command of Sergeant Dixon, chaplain to the volunteers (Rev.

Colling, vicar of Seaham; the body, the deceased's charger, with full equipment, and with boots and spurs reversed, chief mourners, volunteers under the command of Lieut.- Colonel the Marquis of Londonderry. The principal tradesmen in Seaham followed. The body was carried to the grave by eight sergeants. Captains Lindsay, M'Kenzie, Eminson, Warham, John sone, aud Sheradon being pall-bearers. The deceased gentleman was much respected by all classes in Seaham, and by his death the little town lost a citizen whose place was difficult to fill.

Deceased was laid in the large family vault in the presence of many surviving friends, Lutwidge Cookson, Esq., brother of deceased, placing a wreath of flowers on the coffin at the termination of the service at the grave. February 14. \u2014 Mr. Joseph Wilson, or as he was more popularly known, \" Joe Wilson,\" the celebrated Tyneside song writer and vocalist, died at his residence in Railway Street, Newcastle, this afternoon, at the age of 38 years. Mr. Wilson occupied the fore most position amongst the few whose humour was more particularly illustrative of the peculiarities of local character. He possessed a more than ordinary genius as a song writer, many of his songs being marked with the true tinge aud body of humour, while he showed he was no shallow observer of the comic side of local character. He never descended to vulgarity iu any of his effusions, and in this respect they lose none of their claims to public appreciation. Although he lived in a humble sphere of life, his genial nature and quiet, unobstrusive manners secured him the esteem of all with whom he came in contact. February . \u2014 The will of Mrs. Ellen Frances Morritt, relict of William J. S.

About six or seven o'clock in the evening a number of miners went into a quarry, and took possession of a wooden hut, whioh was used by the quarrymen for the purpose of depositing their tools, &c, and getting their meals. Their object in seeking this out-of the-way place was to play at cards without being subject to interference from the police. They played for a considerable time, a quantity of money changing hands. One of the number, James Frater, being exasperated at losing the whole of his money, jumped from his seat, and seizing a tin flask containing three and a half pounds of powder, exclaimed, with an oath, \" Look out !\" and threw the contents upon the fire. The result was a terrific explosion. The cabin was utterly destroyed, and the whole of the men were more or less injured, one of the number being very severely burnt. The noise of the explosion brought a number of persons to the spot, and the injured men were removed to their homes. February 21. \u2014 A severe north-east wind on the coast caused the sea to throw up three dead bodies at Tynemouth, but they were so far advanced in decomposition as to be unrecognisable. February 22. \u2014 The news of the death of Mr. Joseph Love, a well-known colliery owner, which took place at half-past one o'clock this morning, at his residence, Mount Beulah, near Durham, was received by all classes in the North with the deepest regret and sorrow. He was the second son of William Love, a working miner, and was born at New York, near South Shields, in April, 1796, and was consequently in bis 79th year. His father, a man of industrious habits, who was \" keeker\" at the colliery, was twice married, the deceased being the offspring of the first union. After several removals, the family, about the year 1812, settled at West Moor. The lad Joseph, then 16 years of age, was a working miner, having, as usual with colliers' children, been put into the pit to work early in his life. His education, however, had not been for- gotten, and his unflinching industry and steady habits constantly added to the stock of learning he had acquired. When the Loves lived at West Moor, a Mr. Moody was the viewer, and under him, matriculating for a similar post, was Mr. Nicholas Wood ; while, firing at the engines, and deep in his schemes to perfect a locomo- tive, and to accomplish his \" wild dream\" of conveying goods and passengers to London by steam in twenty-four hours, was George Stephenson. The steady and persevering conduct of the latter was similar to that of Mr. Love and his sons, and a great intimacy existed between them. Joseph Love, after a short stay at West Moor, went to work at Percy Main Colliery. From Percy Main, in 1815, he removed over the Tyne to Jarrow, where he served under Mr. Matthias Dunn, then Government Inspector of Mines ; and, in 1820, he abandoned pit life altogether. Mr. Love now took up the trade of a hawker, and travelled the district in which he was so N n"], [344, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 304 well known with a stock of teas, coffee, and drapery goods for sale. In this vocation he made many friends \u2014 people who ofteu extended the warm hand of welcome, or often something more substantial, to him ; and it is a worthy trait in his life that those little kind nesses he then received he returned one hundred fold when pros perity had raised him to the ranks of the wealthy. In 1825, Mr. Love married Miss L. Pearson, daughter of Mr. Isaac Pearson, timber merchant, North Shields, and he then removed to Lumley, where he opened a grocery aud provision shop. Four years later, he removed to Easington Lane, where he opened a similar estab bshment, and it was here he commenced an enterprise on a large scale, which was highly remunerative to him. This was the erection of houses for the workmen at the neighbouring collieries, and those dwellings he sold as fast as he erected them to the surrounding coal owners. He resided at Easington Lane until 1837, when he took Shincliffe Corn Mill, but after two years' residence, he retraced his steps to Tyneside, and there became connected with Messrs. Joseph and John Straker, at North Shields, in the timber trade. This undertaking was lucrative enough, no doubt, and was continued, we believe, some time after the firm had embarked in the coal trade. It was to the latter, however, that their success was due, and it was doubtless to Mr. Love's practical knowledge of mining in all its branches that the enterprise turned out so good. About a year after the partnership in the timber trade had been entered into, the firm of Strakers and Love turned its attention to the Durham coal field, and Brancepeth CoUiery was opened out under their auspices. This was the first effort towards opening out that district which up to that time seemed clearly useless in a mercantile point of view. The coal found was of capital quality, but so \" tender\" in its nature that it was almost impossible to convey it to market in any kind of decent condition. Here Mr. Love made a masterly stroke by coking what would otherwise have been a next to worthless article, as its cost at market would scarcely have repaid the raising of it. As it was, the coke was found to be so good, that it then as now brought a capital price from purchasers. With the starting of Brancepeth Colliery Mr. Love removed from North Shields to Durham, where he lived for nine years. With such a good invest ment as the mine above referred to in hand, and with the prospect of having the district sooner or later opened out by a line of rail way (which was actually completed in 1857 by the inauguration of the Bishop Auckland and Sunderland Bail way), fresh royalties were invested in, and Oakenshaw, Brandon, and Bitchburn Collieries were successively got under way. About the time indicated, a joint-stock company, known as the North of England Coal Mining Association, was in existence, and owned a number of collieries, amongst which were Evenwood, Sunnybrow (or, as it is sometimes called, Willington), Job's Hill, and White Lea. The affairs of the company were, however, in difficulties ; and, at a disposal of their property, Messrs. Straker and Love became the owners of Sunny-"], [345, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 305 brow Colliery. Notwithstanding his advancing years, and the magnitude of his undertakings in band, he continued to look around for fresh investmeuts. Shincliffe Colliery was started by him and a partner, and with Mr. Bobinson Ferens, of Willington Hall, he entered on the working extensively of a district which up to that time only one or two collieries had been started. This was the west end of that ridge of hills which divide the valleys of the Dareness and Browney, which have Brandon and Langley Moor at one end, and Tow Law at the other. In this district Inkermann Colliery was started by Ferens aud Love, and this was followed by Cornsay Colliery by the same firm. Although the lease of the Bitchburn Colliery expired in 1868, the whole of the other under takings assumed leviathan proportions, Brandon Colliery, perhaps, being the most remarkable in this way. With this growth the return the promoters realised from their ventures must have been something enormous, the whole of them being undoubtedly most extraordinarily successful speculations. Turning from the commercial side of Mr. Love's career, the most prominent feature in bis public life was his connection with the Methodist New Con nexion. No more staunch supporter of that body was numbered amongst its members, and Mr. Love was always ready either with his purse or with his personal services to help. In that denomi nation Mr. Love was for some years a local preacher, and he relinquished this duty only as increasing years and infirmities advanced upon him. No better testimonial to his munificence or explanation of the services he had rendered to the Methodist New Connexion can be given than the resolution adopted and entered on the minutes of the 78th annual conference of that body, held at Hanley in June 1874 : \u2014 That the Conference cannot allow the mnnificent aid rendered in several specions and necessitous cases by Joseph Love, Esq , J. P., to pass without its recognition. It would especially nacre the renovation of Yarmouth Chapel, and the other chapels in that circuit, together with the extinction of the debts on the same, amounting to the tctal sum of \u00a31,800, and a gift of \u00a31,000 to the new chapel at West Hartlepool, of \u00a31,000 to the new chapel at Barrow-in- Furness ; also a gift of \u00a3G00 towards the extinction of five chapel debts in London, and the relinquishment of claims upon the same. For these seasonable and liberal reliefs the Conference tenders to Mr. Love its fervent and grateful acknowledgments, and earnestly prays that he and his estimable lady may be enriched with the consolations of the Gos pel, and be long spared to serve the cause of God amongst us by the consecration of their wealth and their influence. This, large as it is, was but a tithe of the open-handed liberality Mr. Love displayed to the body with which he was connected, and few chapels in the district have failed to participate in his muni ficence. Apart from his le'.igion, his means were always ready in support of any charitable appeal, as well as of any movement that might benefit the less fortunate of his fellow-men. He was a justice of the peace for the county of Durham ; but he did not often take his seat on the bench for the disposal of petty sessional business."], [346, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. 306 March 1. \u2014 The Grand Italian Opera Company of Mr. Mapleson, with Madame Titiens at its head, visited the Tyne Theatre, New castle, for three nights, and, notwithstanding that the company had been but a short time previous at the Theatre Eoyal, the success of tbe venture was everything that could be desired. The lovers of Italian Opera were indebted to Mr. George Stanley for the visit, and the more so as it was unexpected, the pleasure being much enhanced by the great novelty of tbe operas which were announced for their three days' stay. Beginning with Doni zetti's grand opera \" Lucrezia Borgia,\" (which had not been played in Newcastle for something like twenty years, when it was produced with Madame Grisi and Signor Mario filling the chief characters) ; it was followed by Verdi's \" Biggoletto,\" which had never been played in Newcastle at all ; and Bellini's \" Norma,\" which was welcome for its grandeur as well as its novelty. The programme for the three days, therefore, was one which could not be excelled ; and, indeed, special pains seemed to have been taken to make the season attractive. March 3. \u2014 The remains of Mr. Charles Attwood, of Holywood House, Wolsingham, were interred in the parish churchyard of that place, in the presence of a large number of spectators. The majority of the shops in the village were closed as a mark of respect to the deceased gentleman. March 9. \u2014 The annual letting of the tolls and dues of Newcastle took place in the Council Chamber, Mr. Councillor Gray acting as auctioneer. The through or great toll of Newcastle (collected at the Tyne Bridge, High Level Bridge, the Bedheugh Bridge, the Walker Boad, and other entrances into tbe town) was first offered for competition. The first bid was by Mr. J. Furness, \u00a33,700, and after a long and eager competition Mr. Potts, the former lessee, again secured the toll for \u00a35,260, being \u00a3520 over the amount at which it was let the year previous. The standage rents of the Cattle Market, which, the year before, brought \u00a31,910, were next offered ; and Mr. Thos. Bower made the first bid, \u00a31,500. When the sum of \u00a31,820 (offered by Mr. Bobt. Nicholl) had been reached, Mr Gray intimated that the reserve price was \u00a32,000. Mr. Bower said be would give that sum, and his offer was accepted. For the standage rents of the vegetable market (which the previous year brought \u00a31,540) Mr. Bower offered \u00a31,000 and the bidding reached \u00a31,220, which was offered by Mr. Nicholl. The lot was secured by Mr. Bower at tbe reserve price of \u00a31,500. The standage rents of the corn market were the last lot. The former rent was \u00a3125 ; the bidding now reached \u00a3105 ; the reserve price was \u00a3140, and Mr. Bower's offer of \u00a3125 was accepted. March 20. \u2014 A memorial monument, which had been placed over the grave of Mr. Thomas Bamsay, miner's agent, was unveiled in Blaydon Cemetery, in the presence of a number of friends.

The style is decorated Gothic of a florid character, the columns having carved capitals, the canopy tabletted and enriched with crocketts, pinnacles, fiuials, monograms, ball flower, and so forth ; terminating with a tabletted spire of finial. The inscription beneath the statue is : \u2014 \" Sacred to the memory of Thomas Bamsay, who departed this life May 8, 1873, aged 61 years.

Near him was found a gun, which had been recently discharged, and a hat in a damaged condition. Dr. Bates was called in to attend Mr. Wheldon, who was afterwards removed to his residence in Church Way, where he died. The deceased who was married, had been in a desponding state of mind for some time previous. March 27. \u2014 Mr. John Hernaman, who, a generation before, had occupied a prominent feature in the political history of this district, died at Sunderland, at the advanced age of 81 years. The deceased gentleman came to Newcastle from Leeds about the year 1832, and, as proprietor and editor of the Newcastle Journal, he was actively associated with the exciting incidents of those days. The violent and personal tone which pervaded some of the articles which from time to time appeared in the paper, more than once brought Mr. Hernaman into unpleasant colbson with some of the leading residents of the district.

The noble chairman, in presenting the testimonial after the ban quet and general routine of loyal and other toasts and speeches, said : \u2014 \" And now, Sir George Elliot, perhaps the pleasantest part of the duty which devolves upon me on this occasion is to ask you to accept this beautiful testimonial which you see before you, and to express to you the feelings of regard and esteem for your private and your public conduct ; and also to tell you that it is not \u2014 and we are perfectly certain you will not look on it, so far as the intrin sic worth of pounds, shillings, and pence, but that you will even take this as a memorial of their esteem, regard, and affection for you, not only as a man and an individual, and one of us, but also at the same time as a member for the county, and that you will look upon it as a testimonial to you, and hand it down to your family as an heirloom, to show what energy, perseverance, and patience will accomplish, and as such, I am sure, it will commend itself to your hands. It is, therefore, with very great pleasure that I ask \u2014 on the part of all those who are assembled here to-night, a great many others who are unable, probably, to get, and all your Conservative friends of the county \u2014 to accept it from them ; and I hope you may be long spared to enjoy it yourself, and have it, after you are gone, to hand it down to your family for ever. Sir George Elliot, on rising to reply, was received with great enthusi asm. He said :\u2014 \" My Lord Londonderry, my Lord Vice-Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen, \u2014 In the first place I feel, as you may"], [349, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 309 naturally suppose, extremely embarrassed at having to reply to this toast, and to thank you for this proof of your friendship and good will towards me. I have not got anything very wonderful to say, except that I should like very much that I might be heard in the few words that I am going to utter by every one present. Now, in tbe first place, I have to thank the noble chairman who has, with the genial manner which is peculiar to his nature, proposed my health to you, and also presented this beautiful memorial. I re member when Lord Londonderry, our noble chairman, the first time I ever saw him, was handed to us a boy at Baintou Meadows Colliery to see. He was then no more than two or three years of age. It was on the occasion of the Duke of Wellington's visit to this county ; therefore, I think, that as far as early friendship and acquaintance are concerned I can go a very long way back. But then, again, as regards other friends, from the highest to the lowest, are you not rather surprised to find that under the circum stances, as I feel myself placed in at the present moment \u2014 imagine that I should be so situated with respect to peers of the realm right and left, noblemen, and also members of Parliament, persons of the highest distinction, who have all come here to pay honour, I don't say to myself, but to the cause which I have advocated . The peculiarity is that I, humble man as I hope always to feel, what ever may be my position in life, should be selected as the exponent or representative of that great doctrine which is now prevalent in this country \u2014 that is the doctrine of Conservatism, and the politi cal principles embodied in our present administration. I don't know why it should be ; but it seems to me to be from some kind of feeling and agreement in our views, as between you who represent those principles and myself, that you have on these several occa sions in 1868, and in 1874, selected me as the person who should represent your views. Gentlemen, when I look at this beautiful testimonial, and when I scan the list of the men who have contri buted to the purchase of it, I am exceedingly interested, as you know, to see that the subscribers are so very numerous ; aud, whilst I am pleased and delighted to see that the noble Marquis subscribes \u00a3100, I am no less pleased, I can tell you, to see the name of the man with his two shillings and sixpence ; and there are many two-and-sixpences on this roll.\" \u2014 The testimonial to Sir George Elliot was placed in full view of the vast assembly on a dais adjoining the platform, and immediately in front of the chair man. The service consists of ten pieces, the principal of which and four dessert stands are grouped together on a silver plateau, and are intended to occupy the centre of the table. The centre piece is constructed with six arms of a very rich floral pattern, and is surmounted by a cut-glass dish for the reception of fruit and flowers. The shaft carrying the arms and dish is surmounted by three figures, typifying Prosperity, Prudence, and Truth, while on the base are four recumbent figures, representing Commerce, Science, Industry, and Mechanics. Each of these figures carries"], [350, "310 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. the emblem usually associated with the attribute represented. Between the figures are panels ou which are represented, in lo w relief, a view of the Penshaw Colliery and the Great Eastern Steam ship laying the Atlantic Cable, enterprises in which Sir George was principally interested. On the others, also in relief, are Sir George's arms, crest, and motto, and the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to Sir George Elliot, Bart., M.P., by his fellow Couservatives in the county of Durham, in recognition of his eminent services to the Conservative cause, 1875.\" The total height of the centre is about 30 inches. The four dessert stands are similar in general style, each being supported by a figure emblematic of Arts, Legislation, and Manufactures. The plateau is of an irregular oval shape, with a richly-chased border ; on either side is a life-medallion supported by two reclining winged figures \u2014 the one medallion bearing the crest of Sir George Elliot within a garter containing the motto, the other medallion being engraved \" Durham, 1875.\" The whole of the plateau is elaborately decorated with festoons of laurel and oak leaves ; while wreaths of laurel at intervals enclose emblems corresponding with the figures on the centre piece and dessert stands. The total cost of the service was somewhat over 2,000 guineas. March 31. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Curzon Street, London, at the age of 65 years, Sir Bowland Errington Bart. The deceased baronet was the second son of Sir Thomas Massey Stanley, ninth baronet, by Mary, only daughter and heiress of Sir Carnaby Hag gerston, Bart., of Haggerston Castle, Northumberland. He married, 7th January, 1839, Julia, eldest daughter of Lieutenant General Sir John Macdonald, K.C.B. many years Adjutant General of the Forces under the Duke of Wellington and Lord Hill, by which estimable lady, who died in August, 1859, he left two daughters both married. In 1820, he assumed by Eoyal license the surname of \" Errington\" only, pursuant to the will of Mr. Henry Errington, of Sandhoe, Hexham, Northumberland, and of Bed Bice, Hants, his mother's granduncle, when be inherited that gentleman's estates. Sir Bowland succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his brother, Sir William Thomas Massey Stanley, June 29, 1863. In default of male issue the baronetcy devolves upon his brother Mr. John Massey Stanley, born in 1810, and married in 1841 to Maria, only daughter of Baron de Talleyrand. Sir Bowland was one of the co-heirs of the Baronies of Umfraville and Kyme. He belonged to the senior branch of the head of the illustrious house of Stanley, being descended in a direct line from Sir William Stanley, of Hooton, in the county of Chester, who was created a baronet in June, 1662. Sir William Massy Stanley, the tenth baronet, sold his princely estate of Hooton, so that this ancient and once influntial family have now no connection with Cheshire.

Deceased had been in a desponding state of mind some time previous to committing the rash act ; and, at an inquest afterwards held, a verdict of temporary insanity was returned. April 6. \u2014 A bazaar for the sale of useful and ornamental articles, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to clearing off the debt on Christ Church school, was opened in the Albion Assembly Booms, Norfolk Street, North Shields, this morning. In the room there were ranged on either side two large tents, with coloured roofs. Opening from these were vandyked valances of crimson cloth, trimmed with white. The side stalls were divided by large doorways, with semi-circular tops, inserted in which were trophies of shields, flags, &c. The stalls containing the fancy and useful articles, were presided over by the following ladies : \u2014 No. 1 \u2014 Mrs. T. Hansell, Mrs. T. Crawford, and Mrs. Kelso ; assisted by Miss Kelso and Miss Crawford. No. 2 \u2014 Mrs. Crighton, Mrs. G. Fen wick, who were assisted by the Misses Adamson. No. 3 \u2014 Mrs. Brutton, assisted by Mrs. Lister, Miss Lintott, Miss Brutton, and the Misses Dale. No. 4 \u2014 Mrs. Baker, and Mrs. Crow ; assisted by Miss Watson, Miss Wascoe, Miss F. Scorfield, and Miss Pye. No. 5 \u2014 Mrs. Carr, Mrs. Bell, and Mrs. Kidd ; assisted by Miss Avery, Miss Kidd, and Miss Wheatley. At eleven o'clock in the morning, a numerous company of ladies and gentlemen had assembled, amongst them being tbe Bev. T. Brutton, the vicar of Christ Church ; Bev. T. Lister, and Bev. J. E. Humble, curates of Christ Church ; Bev. T. Featherstone, vicar of Holy Saviour's, Tynemouth; Eev. A. Burton, curate of St. Peter's, North Shields ; Messrs. G*. Bell, H. Hill, W. Twizell, and J. Carr. After prayers had been offered, the Bev. T. Brutton, said he had hoped that the Dean of Westminster would have occupied the position he filled that morn ing. He heard that the Dean was coming into the neighbourhood, and he wrote and asked him to favour them with his company. The Dean very kindly wrote back and expressed his regret that he was afraid he would not be able to accomplish it. He had written to the Dean agaiu, asking him if he put the bazaar off until two o'clock if it would meet his requirements. The Dean still seemed to wish to come, and sent him a post card stating he could not possibly fix the hour for leaving Scotland. Under these circum stances the ladies had asked him to be their spokesman. It gave him very great pleasure to be surrounded by his parishioners in every good work. and when herememberedthe bazaarof 1872 he was sure it was a harbinger of their success that day. When he looked around the hall he was sure they were likely to reap a very rich harvest, and he hoped the parishioners would rally round them in the good work. They would all be glad to hear that the schools they commenced three years ago had been very successful. Their boys' school was crowded, and if their efforts were crowned with success, they would certainly enlarge the schools. He was glad to o o"], [352, "312 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. say the teachers they had engaged had been all that could be desired. He was sure the inspector had given their teachers, both for religious instruction and education generally, a report second to none in the neighbourhood. The rev. gentleman then declared the bazaar open, and the buying and selling commenced. April 6. \u2014 This evening, about eleven o'clock, smoke was observed issuing out of the shutters of a shop belonging to Messrs. E. J. J. Mays and Sons, wholesale chemists and druggists, Market Place, South Shields. Information was given to the police, and the fire brigade, was promptly upon the spot, but by the time of their arrival, the fire had got a considerable hold, and rapidly extended to the shop adjoining, occupied by a Mr. W. F. While. The flames at one time burst forth with great brilliancy, fears being entertained that, owing to the inflammable nature of the stock, the premises, comprising, on the upper floors, the offices of a solicitor and archi tect, would be totally destroyed. The fire brigade were compelled to break open the shops to further their efforts, and by dint of hard work, supplemented fortunately by an abundant supply of water, the fire was completely extinguished in about an hour, but not before great damage was done to the premises and stock This property was completely destroyed by fire two years previous, and had only been rebuilt upon an extensive scale. April 6. \u2014 Tbe members of the Gateshead Board of Guardians and the officers of the Union gave a complimentary dinner to Mr. B. J. Prockter, J.P., chairman of the Board, who, after a long and honourable career, was about to retire from public life. The din- ner took place at Mr. Wm. Henderson's, Old Mill Inn, West Street, where an elegant and bountiful repast was served up. The chair was occupied by Major J. A. Cowen, who was supported on his right by the guest of the evening, and on his left by Mr. Shaftoe Bobson. The vice-chairs were occupied by Messrs. Matt. Eeay and Wm. Benson, and amongst those present were : \u2014 Messrs. J. D. Caris, Dr. E. F. Cook, Jared Nixon, Eobertson, Edwiu Wakefield, John Hogg, Cuthbert Carr, Thomas Lambert, T. F. Hedley, E. Oliver, J. Scott, J. Henderson, John Lawson, E. Atkinson, Thomas Eeed, Thomas Crozier, Dr. Blackest, J. S. Bobson, E. Potts, L. B. Frazer. The chairman, in proposing the toast of the evening, said they were all well aware of the reason why they had met that night. It was not only to have a good dinner and enjoy themselves, but it was also to have the pleasure of having with them an old friend. They knew that one of the greatest points an Englishman could gain was to be a member of the House of Commons, and next to that was the honour of being a member of the House of Commons in his own locality. The House of Commons in Gateshead was in Prince Consort Road, and their prime minister there was their good old friend Mr. Bryan Prockter. They had had the pleasure of sitting under the auspices of that worthy man for the last twelve months ; and they all knew him as a very industrious hard-working"], [353, "a.d. 1875.] 313 REMARKABLE EVENTS. man for the public benefit. They knew that there was a very large number of public offices which must be filled, and very often at the end of his term a man got anything but thanks. They had seen Mr. Prockter fill these offices, nearly all of them. They had seen him an overseer and a guardian, a town councillor, an alder- man, and chief magistrate of that rising borough ; and during the last twelve months he had been chairman ofthe Board of Guardians. He had been in public offices now for something like a quarter of a century ; h6 had filled all the important offices in the borough, and had filled them well and satisfactorily, aud had now made up his mind to retire into private life. He (the chairman) was sorry for that, because young folks, like himself, liked to have an older man to guide them. He had, however, served his country and his town well ; and they had asked him to come there that night to receive their congratulations on his past career, and to wish him still a long life and a pleasant one. \u2014 Mr. Prockter returned them his sincere thanks for the compliment they had paid him. He said he was surrounded by those who were his old friends, and with whom he had had the pleasure of co-operating for many years in carrying out the great principles of the Municipal Act and the Poor Laws. As a Guardian he had endeavoured, as far as lay in his power, to do what was necessary for the poor needing relief, and also to the ratepayers who provide the money. He entered the borough in the year 1823, and from the following year had been actively engaged in public life, and during all this time it had been his ardent desire to attend sedulously to all the duties incumbent upon him. He had now attained the limit of human life, and he wished to be relieved from these arduous engagements which had occupied so much of his time. He was still, however, connected with Gateshead, and his heart's desire was for its welfare. April 8. \u2014 Services in connection with the induction of the Rev. J. B. Meharry, the newly-appointed minister of the Trinity Presby- terian Church, Newcastle, were held in that place of worship, in the presence of a large congregation. The sermon was preached by the Eev. W. T. Linn, of Whitby. Before proceeding to the ceremony of induction, the Eev. James Mackenzie, of Sunderlaud, Moderator, after alluding to the occasion of their gathering that day, said that exactly twelve months ago the Rev. T. W. Brown was relieved from the pastoral charge of that congregation. \u2014 The customary question having been put by the Moderator and answered by the new pastor, the congregation engaged in prayer ; after which the Moderator formally declared Mr. Meharry admitted and inducted into the ministerial possession of the Church, with all the rights and emoluments appertaining thereunto, and in token there- of gave him the right hand of fellowship. \u2014 The rev. gentleman having in like manner been congratulated by a large number of friends, the Moderator delivered an address to the minister and congregation, as follows :\u2014 \" My dear brother, it is now my duty and privilege, in the name of the Presbytery, to address to you a"], [354, "314 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. few words, not so much of counsel as of warm and brotherly greeting. In the name of my brethren I give you the very heartiest welcome to your new field of labour. Coming to us from another branch of this great Presbyterian family, we rejoice to bail you as a brother sprung from the common stock. We re joice to remember that this church, with which you have hitherto been associated, though numericaUy small, so far from doing any thing to disgrace the family name, has added lustre to some of tbe brightest pages of our common Presbyterianism. April 9. \u2014 An alarming fire broke out at West Hartlepool about a quarter-past twelve o'clock this morning, at the North-Eastern Railway Company's waggon shops, during which property worth \u00a34,000 was destroyed. The works were laid off at the usual hour on the previous evening, all being apparently safe ; but soon after midnight one of the company's servants, at work near the spot, saw smoke and flame issuing from the roof ofthe waggon department \u2014 a large brick building, with a slated and glass roof. The building was upwards of 60 yards long, and about 45 yards broad, and in it were about 27 coal waggons, two or three mineral vans, three ironstone vans, and several vehicles used in goods traffic\u2014amount ing in all to about 50. The man who discovered the fire speedily raised an alarm, and the Bailway Company's fire-engine, as well as that of the Improvement Commissioners, was soon on the spot, as also were a number of the police force, with the portable hose. A strong breeze from the N.N.W. was blowing at the time, which in less than an hour, carried the flames from one end of the spacious erection to the other. At about half-past one o'clock, the roof fell in with a loud crash, and all hope of saving the building and its contents was at an end. The efforts of the brigade were therefore confined to protecting the surrounding property, a task in which they happily succeeded. Before three o'clock, the building was completely gutted. April 9. \u2014 A robbery of an exceedingly daring character was perpetrated on the premises of Mr. Oliver Young, watchmaker and jeweller, Sandhill, Newcastle, this evening. When the shop was opened the following morning it was discovered that the premises had been entered and a large quantity of jewellery stolen. The thieves bad effected an entrance by the door of a passage adjoining the shop, and contrived to get into a cellar underneath. After entering the cellar, a very ingenious plan was resorted to, which at once established the fact that the thieves were expert cracksmen. With the aid of tools, the thieves set to work and were successful in cutting a large hole in the floor of the shop, notwithstanding that the ceiling of the cellar was covered with sheet iron. Having in this manner got access to the shop, they had very cautiously turned the gas low, in order that they might not be detected. They managed to carry of about \u00a3600 worth of jewellery. The articles comprised brooches, rings, thimbles, studs, &c. Almost the"], [355, "AD 1875. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 315 whole of these articles were abstracted from the cases in the window. The thieves had stripped the cards, and after taking 500 gold brooches. 500 silver brooches, 1,000 pairs old gold earrings, six dozen silver thimbles, 100 gold keeper rings, 100 sets of gold studs, and six large gold medals, they left with their booty. A private watchman, employed by a number of shopkeepers in the locality, went his usual rounds during the night and again in the morning, but neither he nor the policeman stationed in that quarter were aware that anything was wrong, so skilfully had the thieves carried on their movements. April 14.\u2014 The freehold property, No. 33, and 34, Sandhill, Newcastle, in the occupation of Mr. Stewart, tea dealer, Messrs. Scott, Bichardson, Purvis, and others, was sold by auction, by Mr. J. G. Smith of Gateshead, at the Eoyal Exchange Hotel, Grey Street, for the sum of \u00a34,720 The purchaser was Mr. Hopper, solicitor, Grainger Street, on behalf of a client. April 19. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Castle Eden, Eowland Burdon, Esq. The deceased gentleman, who was born in 1800, during his life took an active interest in public affairs throughout the county, and in many of the great works which have brought so much pros perity upon its inhabitants. Following the enterprising career of his father, who was the founder of Sunderland Bridge which spans the Wear, he took a warm interest in the prosperity of Hartlepool, upon which he mainly concentrated his attention, and where he succeeded his father as Chairman of the Port and Harbour Com mission, a post which, with a few breaks, he held up to the day of his death, and thus officially connected with the port of Hartlepool, he laboured zealously to serve it to the best of his ability. Mr. Burdon took a great interest in the means of saving life at sea, and one of his last public acts was to aid in placing the Hartlepool life boats under the care of the National Institution. Mr. Burdon him self was, on one occasion, instrumental in saving lives from vessels wrecked near his property, and narrowly escaped with his own hfe. He was a magistrate for the county of Durham, and was for many years Chairman of Quarter Sessions, which post he resigned on account of failing health. Mr. Burdon was a Conservative in politics, and was for many years the able leader of the Conserva tive body in the Northern Division of the County. He left no issue, and was succeeded by his brother, the Bev. John Burdon, of Bicknor-English, Coleford, Gloucestershire. April 21. \u2014 The stock upon the farms at High Espley, near Morpeth, Northumberland, formerly occupied by Mr. Sampson Langdale, was offered for sale by auction, by Messrs. Donkin and Son, Bywell. The stock comprised about 300 Border Leices ters and half-bred ewes and lambs; 120 grazing cattle, cows, and calves; 34 draught and young horses; and a large quantity of implements, poultry, hay, and potatoes. There was a large com pany, and almost everything met a brisk sale at high prices."], [356, "316 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. April 22. \u2014 Mr. M. A. Dodds, Chief-constable of the city of Dur ham, and formerly chief detective in the Gateshead Borough Constabulary, was presented with a gold watch and Albert chain, and a silver tea and coffee service, by the ratepayers of Gateshead, in recognition of his services to the borough as a useful public servant. The presentation took place at the Mill Inn. There was an immense gathering on the occasion, and the chair was occupied by Mr. T. Lamb, the duties of vice chairman being fulfilled by Mr. J. G. Smith. The chairman, in making the presentation, congratu lated Mr. Dodds upon the elevated sphere of public duty which he now occupied, and expressed the warm feelings of the ratepayers with regard to the useful services he had rendered to the borough of Gateshead during a period of nearly fifteen years. \u2014 Mr. Dodds suitably thanked the numerous subscribers* to the testimonial, and suggested, with due deference, that the best course ratepayers in any town could adopt was to appoint experienced men who had risen from the ranks, and who possessed a comprehensive know ledge of their duties, to the rank of chief-constable. May 2. \u2014 An accident of a fatal character occurred at Bishop Auckland, to a man named George Dawson, residing at Bedlington, and formerly of Bishop Auckland. He was visiting his sister, and they had been out together for a walk, being Sunday, and had called at Blue Bow and had a glass of ale. On returning, at half-past nine o'clock, along the railway from that place towards home, and being unaware of an alteration that had been made \u2014 a bridge being in course of erection across a new road \u2014 the poor fel low fell head foremost through an open space in the bridge on to the road beneath, a distance of seventeen feet. He was killed on the spot. His sister was almost pulled through in attempting to save him. May 4. \u2014 A frightful case of suicide occurred at Coundon Gate, about a mile from Bishop Auckland, this morning. A man named Christopher James, 21 years of age, who was employed as a stoker at a neighbouring colliery, and lived with his father and mother at the Old Gate House, New Coundon, went out about 9 o'clock for a walk. When he returned about half an hour afterwards his mother was on the point of going out to bring some water. He told her she could lock the door and take the key with her, as he was going to bed. She went on her errand, and when she returned shortly afterwards she heard the report of a gun. When she got to the house, an innkeeper, named Geo. Waddington, who lived a few yards away, was standing near the door. She asked him if he had heard the shot, and he replied he had. Neither of them could imagine whence the report proceeded. The mother put the key into the door and opened it. She immediately fell back horror stricken. Waddington looked in, and was horrified at the spectacle which was presented. The young man was lying in a pool of blood on the floor, and a gun beside him. His head was blown off, and he"], [357, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 317 was greatly disfigured. A double-barrelled gun and a single barrelled gun where in the house, unloaded, when his mother went out. On examination after the occurrence, both were found to be loaded, and one of the barrels of the double gun had been fired. The deceased had apparently placed the gun underneath his chin and touched the trigger with his foot. Disappointment in love was said to have been the cause of the rash act. May 4.\u2014 A married woman named Storey, who had been living apart from her husband, was found dead in a house in the Shieldfield, Newcastle, where she had been staying. A bottle of laudanum was found beside her, and the medical gentleman who examined her found she had led a very dissolute life, but it could not be deter mined whether she had taken the laudanum for the purpose of self destruction, or for easing her malady. May 4. \u2014A distressing case of suicide occurred near to Elswick Eoad, Newcastle, this evening. About eight o'clock, a man was walking through a field to the west of Mr. Walter Scott's quarry, opposite St. John's Cemetry, Elswick Eoad, when his attention was drawn to a pool of blood on the ground, near which was lying a razor. He traced the blood for some distance, until reaching the quarry. He made an alarm, and accompanied by others he went into the quarry. A horrible sight was then witnessed. A man, about 35 years of age, was seen lying in the deepest part of the quarry, quite dead, with a large wound in his throat. Information was given to the police, and the body was conveyed to an office belonging Mrs. Esther Wyle, Bentick. An envelope was found in one of his pockets with \" T. Liddell, Churchill Street,\" written upon it. \u2014 Beyond this, there was nothing to lead to the identification of the body. It was supposed that the deceased cut his throat with the razor, and then walked to the edge of the quarry and thrown himself in. _May 4 \u2014 The coroner, Mr. J. T. Hoyle, held an inquest at the Stone Cellars public-house, St. Lawrence, Newcastle, touching the death of Charles Wood, 29 years of age. The deceased, who was married, was formerly a clerk in the Newcastle Post Office. Being separated from his wife, he had been staying at different lodging houses in the town. He went to Mrs. Herrington's eating-house, Newgate Street, at which place he had been lodging for a few nights, and asked for a bed. He was told that they were full up, and he left the house. Nothing more was heard of him until about half-past five o'clock this morning, when he was found on his hands and knees in the channel in Clayton Street by a police-constable. He spoke to the officer, who immediately went for Dr. Murray, but on returning a few minutes afterwards, found the man dead. He was of very intemperate habits, and had frequently been seen walking about the streets all night. A cart was got, and the body was conveyed to the Dead House, at St. Lawrence. A post-mortem examination was made ou the body by Drs. Page and Murray, and"], [358, "318 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. they arrived at the conclusion that the deceased died of syncope, arising from want of food, assisted by alcoholic and bilious poisoning. May 5 \u2014 A fatal accident occurred on board the ship Emanuel, lying moored off the New Quay tier, North Shields. While John Rogerson, a Customs' officer, was engaged in rummaging the sails ot the vessel for the purpose of seeing whether there were any contraband goods concealed, he fell from the top-gallant yard on to the deck, and was killed. Deceased was about 42 years old, and had been upwards of twenty years in the Customs' service. May 6. \u2014 Mr. Rigg offered for sale by auction this afternoon, at the Royal Exchange Hotel, Newcastle, a block of property in Sandyford Lane, containing about 2,100 square yards, in the occuparion of Mr. Addison Potter and Mr. Charles F.

May 8. \u2014 A great fire occurred at Thornley Colliery, attended with most serious loss to property, and at one time threatening to involve a considerable portion of that village in the work of de struction. The four engine houses belonging the colliery formed three sides of a square, and in the space so enclosed was the prin cipal shaft. The latter was divided into three sections by means of bratticing, in order to work the main coal, low main, and Har vey seams, and it contained, besides, the spears and other apparatus for carrying on the pumping. The remainder of the space enclosed between the engine houses was a perfect network of wooden gang ways, with cabins for the banksmen, and also the necessary timbering of stays for those bridges, the whole of these erections being of a highly inflammable nature. Behind the low main engine house, and separated from it by only a few feet, was the furnace or upcast shaft, near which were the spouts and screens for loading the coals, while behind the Harvey engine house was a donkey engine aud house, used as additional help for supplying water to the engines, and near this erection was the engine pond. The pumping engine at the extreme corner of the east side was in the charge of Thomas Moor, a brakesman, who stated that he had lighted the gas some"], [359, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 319 time previous to nine o'clock, and about that hour he went into the fire-holes beneath the boilers. On his return, about a quarter past nine o'clock, he found a sheet of fire running up the side of the engine house. How it occurred he could not tell, and he thought it could only arise from one of two sources. The first was from the gas which he had lighted, but which, it may be stated, was three feet from any timber ; the second, and most likely one, was from a plank laid from the engine house on to the top of the boilers, and which, if it had caught fire, must have at once communicated with the side of the engine house, but this plank had occupied that position, to the knowledge of Moor, for ten months at least. Immediately on discovering the flames, Moor dashed off for Mr. Irwin, the colliery enginewright, who lived about one hundred yards off, and who at once proceeded with Moor to the scene of the conflagration. By this time the alarm had been given, people were pouring on to the colliery from the neigh bouring streets, and, short as the period had been since he left, the flames had not only enveloped the pumping engine, but had laid a firm hold of the Harvey bouse. The various officials of the colliery were the first to reach the scene, and amongst them was Mr. Philip Cooper, the viewer, who at once took charge of the operations, the donkey engine being very soon brought into requisition, pouring a copious stream of water on to the burning buildings. Every available hand was devoted to the work of pul ling down the timber erections surrounding the downcast shafting, in order to prevent the flames from spreading over to the timber of the shaft, and also to the low main engine house and the timber erections in its vicinity. Some shifters and stone men \u2014 about half a dozen in all \u2014 were at work in the pit at the time, and at the first alarm a signal was given to those to come to bank. All but two of them \u2014 a man and a boy were brought from the main coal seam, but as they reached the bank they were startled by the breaking of the winding rope in the low main compartment of the shaft. The whole of these were got out safely, and one of the overman at once hastened down to Wheatley Hill Colliery, with which a connection existed, and for which the man and boy had made. They were got out safely enough, although the boy was unconscious when he got to bank. Hundreds ofthe workmen were engaged under the various officials in removing the working plant, and charred woodwork which had accuumlated around the pit shaft while the fire raged. The three engines of the Sunderland, Dur ham City, and Durham College Brigades continued at work till eleven o'clock next morning, at which time every particle ofthe fire might be said to have been extiguished, and the work of removal for new erections began. The exploring party who traversed the workings next day, and made known that they were all right, and that the horses and ponies were alive, also gave great relief to the inhabitants, who were extremely anxious as to whether such a disastrous occurrence was likely to happen, as their dwellings pp"], [360, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 320 almost surround the colliery. The grave fears entertained of an explosion were still uppermost in the minds of the workmen, though miners, as a rule, are strangely accustomed to these catas trophes, and look upon them as a sort of every day occurrence ; yet the probabilites of an explosion were so paramount that the workmen engaged at Wheatley Hill, the adjoining colliery, con sidered it safer to remain above ground, than to enter the mine. Consequently, at the time the men are sent down, only ten out of the thousand workmen engaged in the colliery put in an appearance. A second exploring party, therefore, entered the workings by way of the Wheatley Hill shaft. The party had not proceeded far into the workings before they were \" gassed,\" as the miners term it \u2014 that is, overcome by the inhaling of foul air, which had largely accumulated in the narrow working which connects the Wheatley Hill with the Thornley Colliery. The party were at once drawn to bank in a semi-conscious state, and completely overcome. The accumulation of the foul air was caused by the force of the water sent down the main shaft, when the cry was raised that the pit was on fire. The disaster, though happily unattended with fatal results, is not without its chapter of accidents ; for, a workman named Leames narrowly escaped with his life. He fell from a height of between twenty and thirty feet on to a quantity of burning material, from which he was speedily extricated, when he was found to be suffering from a severe scalp wound, a fractured back, and to be otherwise severely shaken. At the time of the accident Leames was engaged with a number of other brave men in the middle of the fire cutting down the connecting gangways between the two pumping houses, in order to save the one that the fire had not then reached. Constable Lackenby of the Sunderland Fire Brigade, also injured his leg whilst jumping from the engine. The result of the fire was the total destruction of three winding engines, one pump ing engine, and one donkey engine ; an old engine which had not been used for some length of time being all that was saved out of the general wreck, and the estimated damage was over twenty thousand pounds. May 14. \u2014 Died, at his residence, in Alnwick, in his 76th year, Mr. Wm. Dickson, F.S.A., solicitor, and Clerk of the Peace for tbe county of Northumberland. Deceased was born at Berwick-upon- Tweed, where his father was in practice as a solicitor. He came to Alnwick about 1816, and served his articles with Mr. Bobert Thorp, with whom he entered into partnership on the 16th November, 1822. In 1831, he was appointed Clerk to the Magistrates of the Eastern and Northern Divisions of Coquetdale Ward. The latter appointment he resigned in 1858. In 1843 he succeeded Mr. Thorp, as Clerk of the Peace for the county of Northumberland. He was a Justice of the Peace for Berwickshire. He also held the offices of Clerk to the County Bate Basis Committee and Pauper Lunatic Asylum Committee. Formerly he was Clerk to the Com mission of the Alnwick Improvement Act, and on the establishment"], [361, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 321 of the Local Board of Health he became one of its members, and from that time up to his death was annually elected chairman. He was also chairman of the Gas Company, and was for many years chairman of the Board of Guardians. After the failure of the Nor thumberland and Durham District Bank, to meet the requirements of the neighbourhood, he founded the Alnwick and County Bank, which has now branches in all the principal places in the northern division of the county. In his profession he was looked up to as an anthority, and he was greatly missed not only in public, but in private, being a man esteemed and respected by all classes of society. May 17. \u2014 A serious accident, resulting in the death of four young persons, occurred this afternoon, off Whitburn sands, about two miles north of Sunderland. Two youths, named John and William Greig, sons of Mr. J. Greig, tinner, Bodlewell Lane, Sun derland ; and Henry Eendall, son of Daniel Eendall, ferryboat man, residing in Walton Place, were, with some other youths, joint owners of a small boat which they had named the Daisy. These three youths went off in their boat for the purpose of taking a sailing excursion along the coast, and they were accompanied ou their trip by Eleanor Jackson, residing at Whitehouse Crescent, and a pupil teacher at St. Paul's Church of England Schools, Hen don, They were seen by their own friends and others to leave the river and make for the roads, and the day being exceedingly fine, with a comparatively smooth sea and a good breeze, they proceeded northwards with a large square sail set. The last that was seen of them was between three and four o'clock, when some one observed them entering Whitburn Bay. Shortly after four, a fisherman named Purves, residing at Whitburn, found the boat turned bottom up and three hats, two being youths' and one a female's. About eight o'clock at night the body of the unfortunate girl was found, and the next day one of the youths (John Greig), was picked up. The remains were removed to the Whitburn dead-house. The circumstances attending the finding of the bodies and the boat plainly point to the conclusion that the frail craft had been upset, probably during a short squall, and that the unfortunate occupants had been thrown into the water. Of the four only William Greig could swim. The young woman who was drowned was highly respected. Her acquaintance with the Greigs was of long duration. John Greig was twenty years of age, and William was eighteen, and both lads were in the employment of their father. The youngest of the party, Harry Eendall, was about sixteen years. May 17,\u2014 This evening a fatal and melancholy accident occurred off Tynemouth Sands. Three men and a boy had been out in a sculler boat, and were rowing along the coast not far from the shore, when the boat was suddenly capsized by a wave and its occupants thrown into the water. Two of the men and the boy clung to the sides of the boat until rescued, but the other man lost his hold and was drowned."], [362, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 322 May 18. \u2014 The foundation stone of the St. Hilda's Church Young Men's Institute, South Shields, was laid by Miss Delia Chester, daughter of the Vicar of South Shields, this afternoon. The build ing is three storeys in height, having on the ground floor a large reading room, and apartments for house keeper ; on the first floor a lecture room, 32ft. by 25ft., with a handsome pitch pine ceiling of Gothic design. On the second floor a bagatelle room, chess and smoke rooms, all of good size aud height, and well ventilated. The members of the institute mustered in the Market Place, and walked in procession to the site of the new building in Waterloo Vale. Amongst those present were the Eev. T. H. Chester, Eev. J Coul son, Eev. P. H. Moore, Bev. A. Burton, Bev, J. E. Hilliard, Bev. M. Graham, Bev. T. N. Roberts, Messrs. J. M. Moore (Town Clerk), C. H. Green, M. Wood, S. Cottew, John Robson, R. J. J. Mays, T. Tinley Dale, J. Barber, F. Young, C. H. Penning, Jos. Fishburn, W H. Draycott, G. S. Shotton, M. Hall, W. Lawson, and Dr. Den ham. After the hymn \" The Churchs' one foundation\" had been sung and prayer engaged in, a beautiful silver trowel bearing the inscription, \" Presented to Miss Mary Delaval Chester on the occasion ot her laying the foundation stone of the St. Hilda's Church Young Men's Institute, South Shields, Whitsun Tuesday, A.D. 1875, by C. H. Penning Esq., architect,\" was handed to Miss Chester. A bottle containing several newspapers of the day, and other articles having been placed in the cavity reserved, Miss Chester then performed the ceremony of laying the stone. Ad dresses were delivered by the Bev. T. H. Chester, Messrs. J. M. Moore, E. J. J. Mays, and John Bobson, after which the proceedings terminated. In the evening a grand amateur concert was held in the large hall of the Free Library, which was largely attended and passed of satisfactorily. May 19. \u2014 The foundation stone of a new chapel at Dunston, near Gateshead, for the members of the Methodist New Connexion residing in that village, was laid this day by Mr. C. M. Palmer, M. P., in presence of a large number of spectators. The building occupies a site in the low part of the village. A procession was formed at the school room, and, headed by the local drum and fife band, marched through the principal thoroughfares to the site of the new edifice, where they were met by Mr. Palmer. Previous to the stone being laid, Mr. Blenkinsopp, Chairman of the Whickham School Board, placed in a cavity underneath it, a bottle containing district newspapers and various records of the Connexion. The hon. member was then presented with a trowel by Mr. Thomas Wilson, of Gateshead, and with a mallet by Mr. G. Huntley. The ceremonial of the day having been performed, Mr. Palmer, who was greeted with cheers, said considerably more than 30 years ago he visited Dunston every morning before breakfast, and accom plished half a day's work before entering upon his commercial work on the Quayside at Newcastle. At that time Dunston had only the saw mills aud timber yards which belonged to his father,"], [363, "a.d. 1875.J remarkable events. 323 but shortly after their esteemed friend and his old acquaintance, Mr. Archer, came amongst them, and, as time passed on, Dunston, like other places, became somewhat more a centre of manufactures. Looking back 30 years, they really could not but be astounded at the enormous development of manufactures and great interests on the banks of the Tyne, and to him it was a satisfaction to know that those who had been the means of developing these great works were not unmindful of the education and the spiritual wel fare of the great masses of working people whom they brought together. In that respect he believed North Durham could favour ably compare with any other county of the United Kingdom. Dunston was taking another step in advance. It had a new church belonging to the Church of England. As compared with other Church institutions, the Church of England was suffering under a difficulty which he, as a Church of England man, had long observed \u2014 the difficulty of their not being able to open new churches until every shilling of debt was paid off. He could not conceive why, with the great funds at their command, the Ecclesiastical Commis sioners did not advance very considerable sums to assist in com pleting the churches which were so earnestly undertaken by the people in the different districts and parishes. The future of Dun ston would in all probability be a very great one. They would pardon his stating that he came amongst them as a coalowner, who was about to open out the mineral wealth over which they stood, and with tbe development of which wealth there would naturally spring up a large and important population. With river improve ments and increased facilities he had no doubt whatever that they would see the establishment of important manufactories in their midst. Indeed, they would in all likelihood ere long see Dunston becoming a town. Perhaps he might be allowed to be somewhat of a prophet on these matters, inasmuch as he had predicted simi larly of Jarrow, to the incorporation of which her Majesty had, he believed, affixed her name only last Thursday. He would not give them more than ten years in which to look upon the green fields of the surrounding neighbourhood, for by the end of that time he thought they would be applying for an act of incorporation. The hon. member, in some further observations, dwelt upon the value of sound religious conviction in producing respectable members of society, aud concluded by offering the assemblage his sincere con gratulations on the work they had so well begun\u2014 a work which he hoped would find increasing success through generations to come. \u2014 A liberal collection was made at the stone ; and afterwards a tea meeting was held, under the presidency of Mr. Councillor Lucas, of Gateshead. May 19. \u2014 The foundation stone of St. Andrew's Church, at Stanley, for the parish of Beamish, county of Durham, was laid by Colonel Joicey, this afternoon. The great increase of population in the district necessitated the erection of a new parish out of the large area embraced by Tanfield, and in 1873 the parish of Beamish"], [364, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 324 was formed. The Bev. Mr. Grennell was appointed incumbent, and under his care the congregation had become so numerous that the school-room in which they had assembled hitherto provided but inadequate accommodation ; and it was therefore resolved to erect a new church. The building, which had been commenced, was on an excellent site on one ofthe highest parts ofthe village, and when finished would be a conspicuous landmark for miles around. It was designed to hold 350 worshippers, and consists of nave and chance], north aisle, and organ chamber, forming a parallelogram measuring 96 feet long by 42 feet wide. The church is designed after the style prevalent in England during the 14th century. At the ceremony there was a large attendance of clergymen. \u2014 The Church of England service appointed for such occasions having been sung, the Bev. Mr. Mathwin, vicar of Tanfield, addressed the assembly. After some preliminary observations, he said that he had been acquainted with the character of the population of the district for 23 years, and he could assure them it certainly was not so black as those who did not know the people as well as he did imagined it to be. He paid a high tribute to the Eev. Mr. Grennell for his energy, and spoke of the hearty support which the Bishop of Durham had given the clergy in extending their work to meet the increasing wants of the diocese. He also referred to the assist ance given to Church extension in the district by the Earl of Bavensworth, to the spontaneous and hearty aid given by the squire of the parish, Mr. Eden, and to the equally characteristic munificence of the well-known coalowners, Messrs. John and Edward Joicey. \u2014 A handsome silver trowel was then presented to Colonel Joicey, with which he prepared the bed for the stone, and after the bottle with the usual articles had been deposited in the place pre pared for it, the block was lowered to its place, received the orthodox number of taps with a fancy mallet, and was declared by the Colonel to be well and duly laid. Colonel Joicey then said it was with great pleasure he assisted at this ceremony, the more especially as this was now the third time he had laid the foundation stone of a house dedicated to God in this immediate district. He hoped that these three churches would always work together in unity, remem bering that they were all only part of one head. He trusted the new church would go on and prosper, and would be the means of driving away infidelity and irreligion of every kind from the popu lation surrounding it. He remembered well the time referred to by the Vicar of Tanfield. He believed at that time (23 years ago) the parish school could scarce muster 40 scholars ; now they had schools on every side, and he believed there were upwards of 1,400 children attending the parish schools. This was certainly encou raging, and was a strong incentive to them to work on and do still more in the same direction. The Eev. Mr. Grennell also spoke a few words, and moved a vote of thanks to Colonel Joicey for his kindness. \u2014 The compliment was given with cheers. A public tea was afterwards held in the schoolroom, and was largely attended, and iu the evening a special service was held."], [365, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 325 May 19. \u2014 A disastrous fire broke out on the model and extensive farm of Broakoak, near Ebchester. The fire was first discovered by the hind, who at once raised an alarm and dispatched a mes senger to Lintzford for Messrs. Allandale's fire engine and brigade. At first the flames were confined to the straw house, which adjoined the range of buildings in which the stock was kept No time was lost in removing the cows and horses, but this was not accomplished without considerable personal risk in consequence of the smoke. The roof of the strawhouse having fallen in, the flames quickly spread to the barns adjoining, which contained a steam thrashing and other valuable machinery, of the most modern and improved description. This building, and another barn adjoining, were entirely destroyed. The engine house was greatly damaged, and a large granary, containing wool and corn, likewise caught fire, but happily the fire was prevented from extending to that direction. By two o'clock the following morning the flames had been entirely extin guished. May 20. \u2014 Mr. Jobson, of Buteland, was presented with an oil painting of himself and a silver tea and coffee service on the occasion of his leaving North Tyne, by a large number of his friends. The chair was occupied by Mr. Gradon (Mayor of Dur ham), and the vice-chairmen were Mr. George Dixon and Mr. G. Coulson. On the platform were Mr. William Jobson, the Bev. G. B. Hall, Birtley ; Mr. George Boiam, Mr. S. Donkin, the Eev. J. Thompson, Newcastle ; the Eev. D. Donaldson, Alnwick ; Mr. J. Heatley, Alnwick. The chairman, previous to the presentation being made, passed a high elogium on the character and worth of Mr. Jobson, aud then called upon Mr. Samuel Donkin who, in making the presentation, said : Mr. Chairman, ladies, aud gentle men, \u2014 There is nothing that could have given me greater pleasure than to appear here on this occasiou. 1 shall not have any deli cacy or squeamishness in the task that I have to perform. It is as easy and simple as the repetition of the alphabet. It involves no intricate question. Mr. Jobson, your old and esteemed friend, stands before you, and I have nothing on your behalf to reveal. He is made of the real materials of a working man. I do not know if he would have been much better if he had been educated under what I may call the educational curriculum of our modern School Board. We are told that the next age will be an age of philoso phers ; I wish it may not be an age of fopperies and frivolties. -Give me the men who are formed of sound, earnest materials \u2014 men who have the character which enables them to fight their way up to honourable positions, such as that in which our respected friend now stands. The testimonial which I am deputed to present to you, Mr. Jobson, emanates from the feelings of admiration which your many friends of the various grades of society have for you. Without tbe adventitious aid of wealth or rank, you have won for yourself an honourable position in society. Guided by those prin ciples which were instilled into your youth, you have, by the force"], [366, "326 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. of your own character, and by the honesty of your actions, proved yourself to be an example of what can be done by the earnestness of man, by working, as you have done, in the honest, straightfor ward manner which has brought you into your present position ; and I am well aware that no dereliction on your part has caused you to swerve from those principles which have led you this day into the centre of a people's faith. This is not the place for any homilies on the duty of a man to his neighbour. These have been written in legible characters by the greatest of all moral teachers, so that he who runs may read. During twenty-one years of resi dence in this neighbourhood you have proved by the gift of supe rior intelligence, in its application to questions effecting your own honour, that you have been au arbitrator between man and man ; and, looking at the amenities of life, looking at your hospitalities, looking at your disposition and readiness at all times to pour oil on the troubled waters of life, I say that this testimonial, which I have to present to you, you have won fairly and honourably. I am not going to go into the sacred precincts of your domestic circle. She, sir, who has been the sharer of your joys and sorrows must look upon this occasion with feelings of deep interest ; and your chil dren who are to live after you have in this testimonial an heritage of inestimable value \u2014 not for its worth in gold or silver, but they will regard it as above all price \u2014 they will esteem it as the Eomans esteemed the laurel crown given as the voluntary offering of tho people to a man of sterling and of individual worth. Our friend the mayor of Durham has told you that he has known Mr. Jobson since childhood. Well, I have known him since he was a school boy, \" creeping like a snail, unwillingly to school\" \u2014 to that school where he has sat under the ferule, and \" read the day's disasters in the morning face\" of a person who, in after life, won for himself an honourable position as professor in the College of Glasgow \u2014 your uncle, sir, the Eev. Walter Scott. Sad havoc has been made on that schoolboy circle in sixty years. Time will subdue all things ; but you, sir, at any rate, have made an indelible impression upon your neighbourhood and upon your neighbours. In presenting to you this testimonial I shall not delay this compamy by any lengthened remarks. It requires very little explanation from me. There is, as I have said, no question of any intricacy involved in my duty, it is simply to express the feelings which these gists repre sent \u2014 feelings of deep respect which you, sir, have so well created and maintained ; and when the time comes \u2014 and we hope that it may be distant \u2014 when these features that are there pourtrayed shall have undergone the transformation of the grave, those, we trust, who come after you will look upon the features of a father who has won for himself an honourable position iu life, aud who has left an example worthy to be followed by his successors, and one which must prove to them a most powerful monitor. My duty is simply now, in the name of the subscribers, to present you with these testimonials of their regard ; and it would be superfluous in"], [367, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 327 me to say that we wish that you may live many years to enjoy them. I trust, sir, that when you look back upon a somewhat active life you will regard this day as a red-letter one in your existence. Treasure our gift, as it is made in all sincerity of heart. I now, sir, have the distinguished honour, in the name of the sub scribers, to present you with these testimonials of their regard, and I trust that you will long live to enjoy them. \u2014 Mr. Jobson feeling ly replied, aud attributed his success in life mainly to his own perseverance. In conclusion, he hoped his young friends before him, whom he respected very highly, would strike out, every one for himself, a course for himself such as, after they had run it for thirty or forty years, they might have pleasure in looking back upon. \u2014 Other toasts of a complimentary character were given, and the evening spent most harmoniously. May 21.\u2014 Shortly after six o'clock this morning, and within a few minutes of the workmen commencing, a boiler, situated in tha engine and boilermaking shops of Messrs. John Bedhead and Co., iron shipbuilders, Pilot Street, Lawe, South Shields, exploded with a loud report. Owing to the holidays, the engine builders had not been at work during the week, and at the time of the explosion there were only the boilermakers, numbering between twenty and thirty in the shops. It appears that the regular fireman having slept too late, was not at his post at six o'clock, and a young man named Dixon Hey, an apprentice boilermaker-, took his place, and was engaged at the boiler when it exploded. The men engaged in the other departments of the yard were soon upon the spot, and on an examination being made they fonud that the boiler had left its seat and been blown in a westerly direction, a distance of some thirty feet. In its course it had gone through the east side of the boiler shop, causing a portion of the roof to fall in. The bricks and woodwork of the shop, with a quantity of glass and tiles, were lying about in all directions, and the force of the explosion had been such as to carry away the front of the store room. The young man Hey was found to be very severely scalded and bruised, as was also a labourer named Matthew Smith. Dr. Crease was quickly in attendance, and dressed the injuries of these men, who appeared in great agony. Both of them were afterwards removed to the Ingham Infirmary, where they were attended to by Dr. Denham aud Dr. Wilson, the house surgeons. Mr. George Fraser, timekeeper, was in the store room at the time of the occurrence, and was thrown beneath some boxes. He was stunned for a while, but he recovered in a short time. Mr. William Smith, foreman boiler smith, who was near to the boiler, was carried a distance of about twenty yards along the shop, but fortunately he escaped without serious injury. James Hindmarsh, a fitter, was engaged at a screw machine close to the boiler, and he also was scalded a little. Two other men, named Davison and Harvey, were also slightly injured. Fortu nately, the number of men at work was small, for had the shop been in full working order, the result of the explosion would, probably, Qq"], [368, "328 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. have been much more serious. The boiler was a multitubular one, only four years old, and made of the best Tudhoe boiler plates. It had been cleaned out only a few days prior to the explosion, and the cause of the accident was quite a mystery. May 21. \u2014 A fire, which proved rather serious, broke out about three o'clock this morning in Pottery Lane, Forth banks. The buildings destroyed were mainly wooden erections. The fire broke out in a cabinet-maker's workshop, the property cf Mr. Ives, Scots wood Eoad. The flames were first observed by some of the North- Eastern Eailway Company's officials, whose attention was attracted by the yelping of a dog and the ioud neighing of a horse. A messenger was sent to the Westgate Police Station for assistance, and speedily the hose and reel from that division, and a number of the brigadesmen, were at the scene of the fire. Only a short inter val had elapsed before the brigadesmen arrived, but on their reaching the place the flames had assumed alarming proportions, and, with the wind blowing rather stiff from the west, it was at once apparent that none of the buildings in the yard itself could be saved. The sheds at the west side of Mr. Ives' workshop, the latter of which was two storeys high, being constructed principally of wood, were quickly destroyed, and the attention of the brigadesmen was directed towards the outer buildings, which were threatened. Great fears were entertained for Mr. Joicey's factory, as the flames were seen consuming a portion ofthe cattle shed adjoining these premises, and operations were immediately commenced with a view, if possible of preventing the fire from making further progress in that direc tion. Working with a will, and having a good supply of water, the fire was in a great measure checked, when suddenly a portion of the roof of the sheds fell in with a loud noise, and smothering for a time the flames, enabled the brigadesmen to check the fire in that quarter. At the opposite end of the yard the flames reached a shed belonging to Mr. Taylor, where several cattle were housed. Water was directly made to play on the burning wood work, and after a time, and before much damage was done, the fire was extinguished. The heat was intense, but notwithstanding that, the cattle in the building were liberated and drove out of harm's reach. Ultimately the fire burned itself completely out, but not before Mr. Ives' premises, the other wooden erections, and a portion of the cattle sheds were entirely gutted. Access having been obtained to the yard, the brigadesmen found lying on the ground on which Mr. Ives' stable was situate, the remains of a pony, a retriever dog, a goat, and some poultry. Mr. Ives' premises were stocked with furniture, &c, at the time, and with the exception of some iron work not a vestige was to be seen. May 21. \u2014 This morning, a copy of the charter of incorporation for Jarrow arrived at that place from the London agent of the promoters, the original of which received the approval of Her Majesty in Council on the 13th inst. The new borough consists of the whole ofthe Local Board district, together with a piece of land"], [369, "A.D. 1875 J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 329 to tne south. There are four wards, and the Corporation comprises a mayor, six aldermen, aud eighteen councillors. The document directed \" that the burgess list must be prepared aud published eight days before the 27th of June ; that Mr. E. G. Meynell, Comity Court Judge, is to be the revising barrister, whose court will be held on the 21st of July ; that the first election of councillors will take place on the 10th of August, 1875, \" and upon the 1st day of November, 1875, and on the same day in every year,\" one-third of the councillors will retire ; that the first alderman will be elected and assigned to their respective wards on the 18th of August, and that the first election of the auditors and assessors will take place on the 1st March, 1876.\" May 22. \u2014 An accident, which ultimately proved fatal, occurred on the Town Moor, Newcastle. A young man named Marshall Anderson, employed as a cellarman with Mr, J. E. McPherson, White House Buildings, Pilgrim Street, was exercising his master's horse on the Moor, when it took fright, and ran away at a tremen dous pace. It ran along the Cow Hill Boad, and whilst attempting to leave the road it caught the curb stone, and stumbling heavily threw its rider. Iu the fall one of Anderson's feet got entangled in the stirrups, and he was dragged along by the horse for nearly 50 yards, when the animal was stopped. Anderson was found to be insensible, and was removed on a stretcher to the Newcastle Infirmary. On examination it was found that he had received severe internal injuries. He was never conscious, and died on the following morning. June 5. \u2014 The village of Dinnington, near Ponteland, was the scence of a dreadful tragedy. The victim was a woman named Sarah Duxfield Charlton, the murderer being her husband, Bichard Charlton, who also endeavoured to commit suicide. Charlton, who lived in Dinnington, married a sister-in law of Mr. Eobson, farmer, Gardner's Houses, Dinnington, and for some time they lived com- fortably together, there being apparently nothing to disturb the peace of their wedded life. Mrs. Charlton possessed some \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 in her own right, and she refused to give it up to her husband, who, in the latter part of his married life, constantly sought its possession. His persistent applications were always refused, and in the end the unhappy cause of dispute led him to treat the deceased with such systematic tyranny and cruelty that she fled to Mr. Eobson's farm, where she obtained shelter. Here she remained some time, and about two months previous to her violent death she was delivered of a child. Her husband, during her stay, constantly sought interviews with her in order to induce her to return home ; but fearing that he might renew his course of ill treatment, she refused to comply with his wishes. Eepeated disappointments made Charlton desperate. At two o'clock, when the sisters were alone, he entered the kitchen and seizing his wife by the arm, ex claimed, \" Now, are you going to return, or what are you going to"], [370, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 330 do 1\" Thereupon, without more words, he placed a revolver at the back of her head, and fired. The woman fell with a groan. In furiated, the culprit bent upon making a slaughter-house ofthe farm kitchen. Seizing Mrs. Bobson, his wife's sister, by the arm, he deliberately fired into her face ; but, fortunately, the bullet, in the desperate struggle which occurred, only grazed her left cheek bone. By dint of frantic efforts, his second intended victim eluded his grasp, and, with \"great presence of mind, got into a pantry, along with another sister, Mrs. Bennett, who, from terror and bodily ail ments, was unable to lend effectual assistance. The women screamed for assistance, but none arrived. The still raging man, baffled for a time, then endeavoured to force the pantry door, with his shoulder leant against it, he pressed until it had almost yielded, but Mrs. Bobson, with the strength which belongs to a person seeking to avoid a horrid death, held it with her whole force. Foiled in this attempt, Charlton then, with great savagery, fired at the doorway, but the woodwork was too stout to admit of the bullets passing through. Seeing this, and apparently more maddened than ever, he again rushed against the door, and this time succeeded in getting it partially opened. Mrs. Bobson, with great bravery, re sisted, and endeavoured to again close the door, in doing so, she disclosed a portion of her hand, and the murderer fired. The bullet slit her thumb, passed through the top of her hand, and fell to the pantry floor. Unable to get in by the doorway, Charlton suddenly left the kitchen, and the place remained in silence for a short space of time. The anxious females were unable to divine what w*ould be his next design, and were waiting in great bodily fear, when they suddenly observed Charlton's face at a back window upon them. He fired through the glass, bnt his shots fell harm lessly. Seemingly not satisfied with this point of attack, he made his way round the building again, aud, meeting with a fourth woman, also named Mrs. Bobson, fired at her without assignable reason ; fortunately, his shot did not take effect. Spent probably by the scene of blood through which he had passed, the unhappy man returned to the kitchen, and, placing the revolver against his right cheek, fired into his head. Shortly afterwards, one of the men servants entered, and found Mrs. Charlton lying upon the hearth, with her head towards the fire-place. She was still living, though quite unconscious. Her husband lay by her side, and at a little distance, on the floor, was his revolver, a five-chamber weapon. Dr. Heath, of Newcastle, and Dr. Jameson, of Ponteland, were soon in attendance. All needful steps were taken, but from the first the case of Mrs. Charlton was pronounced hopeless, and after lingering in an insensible condition throughout, she expired about one o'clock the next morning. Charlton's wound was for a time considered mortal. The bullet had entered by the right cheek bone, through by the front part of the ear to the back of the brain. It was at first thought that he might be taken to the Newcastle Infirmary, but the medical attendant being of opinion that he"], [371, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 331 might not live through the journey, he was removed, in the custody of the police, to his own home, after having lain in the kitchen of tbe farm all night. Mrs. Eobson's injuries, though serious, were not dangerous, but it was long before she recovered the shock to her nervous system. The investigations made by Supt. Taylor disclosed some startling circumstances. Mr. Taylor extracted from the pantry door the bullets fired into it, and found on the floor the shot which had passed through Mrs. Eobson's hand. In all about seven shots must have been fired by Charlton, and to discharge his weapon that number of times would necessitate it being re-loaded, there being only five chambers. Bearing out strongly that the rovolver was re-loaded, is the fact that several of the chambers were still charged. Circumstances go to prove that the murderer must have meditated the dreadfulacts whichhe committed, for in addition to the revolver being a new-looking article, and evidently recently purchased, there was found on his person a brown-paper containing two or three dozen conical shaped bullets. At the inquest held on the 8th inst., the jury found a verdict of \" Wilful Murder\" against Bichard Charlton. June 8. \u2014 The foundation stone of a new English Presbyterian Church was this day laid at Jarrow. The ceremony was entrusted to Mrs. Hedley, of Chirton House, who, with her husband, Mr. Aid. Hedley, had taken an active interest in the progress of the movement. The Eev. W. Profeit, after a few preliminary obser vations, presented to Mrs. Hedley a trowel for the performance of the ceremony. This implement, which was of silver, was exceed ingly chaste and neat, and bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" Pre sented to Mrs. Hedley, Chirton House, North Shields, on the occasion of laying the foundation-stone of the English Presbyterian Church, Jarrow, 8th June, 1875.\" In the cavity of the stone had been placed a bottle, containing the papers ofthe town and district, the current coins, and other articles. The necessary prelimi naries having been adjusted, Mrs. Hedley, trowel in hand, spread the mortar, the stone was lowered, and mallet and plummet having been finally applied, the lady said, \" I declare this stone rightly and truly laid.\" \u2014 Mr. Aid. Hedley, ascending the newly-laid stone, then addressed the spectators. He said that they had just wit nessed the laying of the memorial stone of that edifice ; and he prayed that the Almighty Builder might be with them, aud enable them to raise the copestone with shouting, for except the Lord built the house they laboured in vain that built it. The work which they had entered on that day was a work for God ; and he hoped their children and children's children would bear on the banner of truth to a glorious future. In building that church they had no sectarian object in view. They had nothing but good wishes to every other evangelical body. JunelO. Themembers ofthe Newcastle and Gateshead Licensed Victuallers' Association, together with a large number of other"], [372, "332 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. friends, assembled at the Turk's Head, Grey Street, Newcastle, the occasion being the presentation of a silver tankard and a purse containing \u00a3350 in gold, to Mr. W. W. Blakey, secretary of the above society. Departing from the ordinary custom at such gatherings, a fruit banquet was provided in accordance with ar rangements made by the Testimonial Committee. \u2014 Mr. W. B. Eeid occupied the chair; and Mr. Nicholson, President ofthe Association, the vice-chair. After the usual loyal aud patriotic toasts, Mr. James Mackenzie, in making the presentation, said the Licensed Victuallers' Association had been established for 2 1 years, and he had observed with pleasure that every year it had improved, both financially and in regard to the number of its members. Both the President and Mr. Blakey did their duty to the society ; they were energetic and hard working men ; and he thought it was the duty of wholesale victuallers, merely not retail victuallers, to second their efforts as far as they could, because he believed the great action of the association was not defiance but defence. Mr. Blakey, during the time he had acted in the capacity of their worthy sec retary, had done very much indeed to add to the respectability of the trade ; and so well was he versed in matters connected with it that various associations in the district had courted his assistance. The liberal responses made to the testimonial promoters proved to him that Mr. Blakey must have a very great number of friends in the town, and must be very well respected. He would not detain them longer, but presented Mr. Blakey with the tankard and purse of gold, wishing him long life and health to enjoy them. Mr. Blakey, in returning thanks, said it was much more easy for him to feel than to express his gratitude for the good feeling which had prompted them to make him such a magnificent present. He was quite sure that they overstated the services he had rendered to the trade. He had simply done what he believed was his duty ; and though a great deal of labour had devolved upon his shoulders, it had been purely a labour of love. He believed their association owed its success greatly to the unity and energy which had prevailed amongst its officers ; and he believed they had been distinguished in this respect over other societies in the neighbourhood. As a humble member of the National Council, he had always endeavoured to get this part of the country represented as well and as ably as any other town in England, and if he had succeeded in pleasing his fellow-townsmen and a large number of friends around, he was deeply thankful. He sincerely thanked them one and all for this magnificent mark of their approbation, and he earnestly hoped that he would never during his lifetime forfeit their esteem The tank- ard, a massive and beautifully designed vessel, was thus inscribed : \u2014 \" Presented to Walter W, Blakey, together with a purse of gold, by the Licensed Victuallers of Newcastle, Gateshead, and the district, and other friends, in recognition of bis valuable services to the trade. 10th June, 1875.\""], [373, "a.d. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 333 June 12.\u2014 This afternoon the members of the Tynemouth Volun- teer Life Brigade performed a very interesting ceremony. The lifeboat, named the Constance, which they had for some time, was considerably damaged during the preceding severe winter, and it was found necessary to have it replaced by a stronger one. Through the efforts of Mr. Charles Dibdin and the officers of the civil service, who had on many occasions shown their practical sympathy with the sailors' hardships, such a boat was placed in the hands of the Eoyal National Lifeboat Institution, who at once took the necessary steps to have it fixed at Tynemouth. The boat is one of the strongest and safest that could be built. It is 36 feet long, with a beam 9 feet 6 inches. It has 12 single oars, and will carry forty people including the crew. The ceremony performed was the christening and launching of this new boat. The haven was crowded with gaudily-coloured crafts, but the most conspicuous object of all was the new lifeboat on the ways, manned by her crew in their cork jackets and red caps, ready to receive the wine and then take the water. \u2014 Mr. Charles Dibdin, who is a great grandson of the composer of \" Tom Bowling,'' and many other beautiful sea lyrics, then presented the boat, in the name of the subscribers, to the Eoyal National Lifeboat Institution. In making the presen- tation Mr. Dibdin very gracefully said : \u2014 In the name and on behalf of the Civil Service Lifeboat Fund, which I have the honour to represent, I have great pleasure in handing over to you, as re- presenting the Eoyal National Lifeboat Institution, this lifeboat which is about to be launched ; and I trust that, through the providence of Almighty God, it may be the means of rescuing numbers of our brave sailors and fishermen, on whom the greatness of this country so much depends, from a watery grave, and averting from many homes a dire and irrevocable calamity. Captain Charles Gray Jones, the representative of the Eoyal National Lifeboat Institution, accepted the boat, expressing the pleasure he felt in receiving it from the members of the civil service, who had always been notable for the interest they had displayed in the cause of saving life, The Mayor of Tynemouth accepted the boat on behalf of the local committee. \u2014 He said : On behalf of the Local Committee ofthe National Lifeboat Institution, and in the name ofthe borough, I accept from Capt. Jones this lifeboat. In. doing so, I know I am not imposing upon myself individually, or the borough collectively, so heavy a task as will fall upon the noble and gallant crew who have hitherto manned the Constance, for upon them will devolve the onerous and dangerous duty of seeing that this new boat is manned and ready at all times necessary to give assistance to our fellow-creatures in distress. I cannot conclude without referring to the happy name which has been chosen for the boat. We have amongst us to-day the great grandson of the Charles Dibdin him self whose songs of sea life has charmed the world ; and if that grandson is not immortalising himself by writing songs about sailors, and the kindliness which has always dwelt in Britishers"], [374, "334 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. wards them, he is proving that he had the same kindly feeling for seamen that his ancestor had ; and if he has not written songs about them, he has been instrumental in presenting to the National Lifeboat Institution the boat now before us, and that bears a name than which a better could not have been given it. Long life to him, and may he never be known for less worthy acts than raising money for lifeboats. The usual baptismal bottle of wine was then broken on the boat by the Mayoress of Tynemouth (Miss Adamson), which was launched into the water amid cheers. June 24. \u2014 Late this evening a fire broke out in Messrs. Palmer, Hall, and Co.'s timber yard, situate at Dunstan, about two miles west of Gateshead, and near the river Tyne, doing damage to a large amount of stock and saw mill machinery.

Three persons were killed on the spot, another dying shortly after wards. The engines ran off the metals, and, taking the carriages with it, the whole were precipitated down an embankment into a field. Three young ladies, Miss Winship, Miss Alice Winship, and Miss Louisa Winship, of Kirk Hill, who were walking in the field, were eye-witnesses of the terrible calamity. July 8. \u2014 An extraordinary accident occurred on board of the steam ferry Northumberland. This morning, between seven and eight o'clock, along with other vehicles, there was crowded into the Northumberland ferry, at the North Shields landing, a large brewer's lorry, filled with casks of beer and spirits, belonging to Messrs. Carr, Ormston, and Carr, of the Low Lights brewery, of that town. After the gangway was up, and the boat had turned up the river, she took a list to one side, and an effort was made to get the lorry more amidships, but the drayman was unable to do this. The lorry began to gradually settle down into the waist of the boat and give it a stronger list, notwithstanding the drayman was helped by the passengers, it ultimately fell back and pressed against the gangway. The lorry burst the gangway open, and though tbe horses pulled with might and main, the chain horse tearing its fore shoes off in the struggle, it rushed over the side of the boat into the river, dragging the horses with it. The chain hook caught the drayman by the trousers, and he would have been dragged into the river and drowned with the horses too, had not he made a click which tore his trousers and released him and so escaped. The horses and dray sank at once, and the horses were drowned, but no further mischief was done on board the boat. The bodies of the horses, with the lorry and most ofthe casks, were recovered. July 11. \u2014 A severe thunderstorm passed over Hexham and its vicinity ; the lightning was very vivid, and the rain fell in heavy showers. Near to Haydon Bridge a very lamentable accideut occurred, a young farmer, named Mr. Nicholas Woodman, of Crow Hall, near Bardon Mill, and two valuable horses being struck by the electric fluid and killed. July 20. \u2014 An inquest was held at the Fat Ox Inn, Whitley, touching the death of Jane Wright and Mary Eleanor Thorpe, who were drowned at the Half-Moon Eock, Whitley. \u2014 John Dick, 52, Westmoreland Terrace, Newcastle, identified the body of Jane Wright as that of his sister-in-law, aged 15. \u2014 Eobert Carr, fisher man, said he recovered her body. She showed no signs of life at that time. She was floating near the cliff at the south end of the sands. \u2014 Swarley Thorpe, Picton Place, Newcastle, identified the second body as that of his daughter, Mary Eleanor, aged 19. He said his family had been staying at Whitley for a month. She had R r"], [376, "336 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. bathed only once before, and could not swim. She could only float, \u2014 Thomas Davis, Ashfield Terrace East, Newcastle, said that at the time that deceased were bathing \u2014 about half-past twelve \u2014 they were alone. He saw them go into the water, and they seemed at once to drift away with the current. They went for a long distance in shallow water just beside each other. He went for Mr. Dunn who looks after the bathing machines. The ladies were then about twenty yards off, but disappeared almost immediately. The sea was rough at the time, and he thought it was rather rash of ladies to venture into it. He and Mr. Dunn rushed to the boat, which was at some distance from the shore, but being the only men there they could not get it down, About twenty minutes had elapsed before the boat was got down to the sea, and then it was found so dangerous to go out, especially as it was hopeless to find the ladies alive, that the boat was not put to sea. \u2014 Mary Simm, 13, Sea View, Whitley, said that she went to bathe at the same place as the deceased, while they were in the water. They were further out than she was and in deep water, a few yards from her. They wanted her to go to them, but she would not, and soon after hear ing a cry, she looked round, aud just caught a glimpse of a hand above water She was then in danger herself ; the sand was soft and the current strong. Witness had bathed there all the week, but not so near the rocks. She was on her knees and could not get up, but managed to crawl in that position to the shore. \u2014 John Taylor, coastguardsman, said that at about half- past twelve o'clock his attention was called to the accident, but he could not see the deceased. There was a constant alteration ofthe sand and current at the place where the accident happened ; and it was always dangerous to be there when the tide was down. There was a notice board to the effect that it was dangerous to bathe within 200 yards of that end of the sand, but it was difficult . to understand, and almost illegible. When the boat was got down it was quite danger ous to go to sea. \u2014 John Dunn, keeper of the bathing machines, said there were cork jackets, life buoys, and lines in the bathing machines, but the spot where the ladies were, as indicated to him, was at least 200 yards from the shore, and these means of safety were useless. \u2014 The verdict was that the death of the young ladies had been caused accidentally ; and it was recommended that the notice board should be put into a proper state. July 29. \u2014 The election of a representative for the borough of the Hartlepools, to fill the place of Mr. Thomas Eichardson, who, owing to financial difficulties, accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, took place to-day with the following result : \u2014 Isaac Lowthian Bell, Esq., 1,962; William Joseph Young, Esq., 1,464; Mr. Ahmed John Kenealy, 259 ; consequently Mr. Bell was elected. July 31. \u2014 This afternoon, the body of Captain Allison, of the 1st Newcastle Engineer Volunteer Corps, was buried in Jesmond Cemetery with military honours. The Engineers, under the com-"], [377, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 337 maud of Capt.-Commandant Palmer, assembled at the Armoury, in Newcastle-on-Tyne, and marched to Normanby Terrace, Gateshead, where the deceased resided, and there they were joined by detach ments from the Newcastle Bifle Volunteers, the Gateshead Eifle Volunteers, the Engineers from Jarrow, and from several of the Artillery corps in the district. The bands of the Newcastle and Jarrow Engineers were also present. The coffin, which was covered by the Union Jack, the accoutrements of the deceased captain, and wreaths of immortelles, was placed on a gun carriage, drawn by six horses belonging to the Eoyal Artillery. The procession left the house in the following order : \u2014 Firing party, with arms reversed ; band of the Newcastle Engineers, playing the \" Dead March ;\" the gun carriage bearing the coffin ; mourning coaches and private coaches ; Volunteers, Freemasons ; Jarrow band, playing a dead march ; Volunteers, Northumberland Yeomanry, mourning coaches and cabs. The procession went slowly through the streets of Gates head and Newcastle, the roads being lined with great crowds of spectators, to the old cemetery at Jesmond. August 2. \u2014 Three persons were executed within the Gaol of Dur ham this morning. At the assizes, held a few weeks previous, there were no less than eight persons indicted on five charges of wilful murder. One case was reduced to a charge of assault, and the prisoner got off with nine months' imprisonment. Another prisoner named George Herbert Plummer, who was charged with the murder of his sweetheart, Sarah Forster, at Brandon, near Durham, was proved to be insane, and was ordered to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure. Two more, named Durkin and Flynn, were sentenced to fifteen year's penal servitude ; and another named Gallagher being found not guilty, only three were left for execution. The names of those executed were Michael Gilligan, William McHugh, and Elizabeth Pearson. Gilligan was concerned in a street row at Darlington, whereby a man named John Kilcran was brutally kicked to death. Durkin and Flynn, the two prisoners mentioned above, were also concerned in the same affray ; but, it was alleged, on the part of the prosecution, that the immediate cause of death was in consequence of kicks inflicted by Gilligan whilst his victim was on the ground. There was certainly a doubt as to which of the many kicks Kilcran received had\" caused his death, and efforts were made for a commu tation of the sentence, but the Home Secretary refused to interfere. The man McHugh was charged, in conjunction with Gallagher, with the murder of a man named Thomas Mooney. The trio had been drinking together, and when turned out of the public-house the two prisoners had picked a quarrel with Mooney, and after assaulting him, had thrown him over a wall into the river Tees at Barnard Castle. Bobbery was said to have been the motive for the crime, and it being proved in evidence that Gallagher had, at the last moment, felt some compunction, and refused to proceed further in tbe deadly work, he was acquitted by the jury. Efforts"], [378, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 338 were also tried on behalf of McHugh, but in this, as in the former case, the Home Secretary refused to interfere. The female prisoner, who was 28 years of age, and a married woman with four children, was found guilty of murdering her uncle, with whom she had been living as housekeeper, by poisoning him with a poisonous compound for killing vermin. No effort was made on her behalf, and she maintained, from the time of her apprehension till her death, a dogged sullenness. The press were excluded from the execution, and beyond the fact of a black flag being hoisted above the prison walls at eight o'clock, and the usual travestie of an inquest, the public had no other guarantee that the law had taken its course. August 3. \u2014 Messrs. Donkin and Son offered for sale at the Central Station Hotel, Newcastle on-Tyne, the Easington Grange Estate, near Belford, Northumberland, of about 321 acres of land, with house, offices, and gardens, cottages, farm buildings, water power flour mill, dwelling house, and other buildings. The bidding commenced at \u00a320,000, offered by Mr. Edward Leadbitter, solicitor, but as only two more offers were made, reaching \u00a322,000, the estate was bought in at the reserve price of \u00a340,000. The Amble Link House Estate was also offered in ten lots, seven of which were sold at a large increase on the reserve price, the remaining three lots being bought in. August 4. \u2014 Messrs. Joseph L. Thompson and Sons, North Sands, Monkwearmouth, launched a fine screw steamer of the following dimensions: \u2014 Length, 258ft.; breadth, 33ft.; depth, 22ft. 6in. ; and of about 2,000 tons burthen. She was built under special survey to class 90a Lloyd's. Her engines were of 150 horse-power nominal, on the compound surface- condensing principle. Before leaving the stocks, the vessel was gracefully christened the Croft by Miss Alice Hodgson, of Blyth. The launch was witnessed by a large number of ladies and gentlemen. August 12. \u2014 A farewell dinner was given in the Albion Hotel, North Shields, to Mr. T. J. Harbutt, who was about leaving his native town for New Zealand, when a splendidly-illuminated ad dress, in a large gilt frame, was also presented to him. It con tained at the top striking portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Harbutt, and bore the following inscription : \u2014 Thomas Jefcoate Harbntt, Esq. Respected and dear Sir,\u2014 We, the undersigned tradesmen of North Shields, beg yonr acceptance of this address, on the occasion of yonr leaving this country for New Zealand, as a token of our personal regard and esteem, and as a mark of our appreciation of your unswerving integrity, untiring energy, and amiability as a man of business, which have not only caused you to be endeared to, and respected by, all with whom you have come in contact, but have also been very materially the means of improving the commercial posi tion of this your native town ; and also as indicating our earnest hope that, in your new sphere of labour, you may meet with the snccess which cannot fail to crown the efforts of one who has given such proofs of his energy and attainments."], [379, "A.D. 1875.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 339 William Twizell, Esq., in the absence of C. A. Adamson, Esq. (ex mayor for the borough), who was supported on the right by the guest, and on the left by his respected father, presented the address. He said he had known Mr. Harbutt for very many years. No man as a citizen, or a tradesman, or father of a large family, left the town with more honour and credit ; in fact, he might say, and say truly, without one stain upon his character. His untiring assiduity in business had made him a fortune, and it would be well were every tradesman in the town to follow in the footsteps of their respected guest. He now called upon all present to rise up and drink \" Long life and happiness to Mr. Harbutt, his wife, and family,\" and might they enjoy a pleasant sail to their place of future residence ; and he hoped that if, on their arrival there they found things not as represented, they would \" about ship\" and return again to \" canny Shields.\" After the cheering had sub sided, Mr. Harbutt in feeling terms referred to the town of his birth, the place also of his education and commercial enterprise, and the many friends he had made, and which he was now to say farewell to. He hoped they would excuse him from making a formal speech, as it was a thing he had never thought after or cultivated ; but even if he had, his head was too overloaded with other matters to deliver it. There were other ties he had to sever himself from which required all his power of mind and body to bear him up. He alluded to family ties ; he was leaving ties such as fell to the lot of few \u2014 an unbroken, loving, united circle. Mr. Harbutt, who was evidently labouring under great emotion, then resumed his seat, after again thanking them for the honour they had done him. August 18. \u2014 The interesting ceremony of swearing in the first Councillors, and the first meeting of the new municipal body, took place in the board Boom of the Jarrow Local Board of Health, Grange Eoad, Jarrow\u2014 -Aid. J. B. Dale, J. P., presided, and among those present were Messrs. W. H. Allison, J. P , W. H. Eichardson, J. P., E. Joicey, J. P.. Thomas Sheldon returning officer at the election, W. 8, Daglish, who officiated as clerk, and the whole of councillors as under : \u2014 South Ward \u2014 E. E. Huntley, T. Gray, J. H. Dale.

Hedley, C. B. Barnes, J. Wardle, T. Gibb, W. H. Dexter. The proceedings commenced by Mr. W. S. Daglish hand ing in to the chairman the notices calling the meeting, and also the new charter of incorporation, all of which was duly received by the chairman, after which the whole of the Councillors were regularly sworn in, and the declarations were signed as required by law. These pre'iminaries having been performed, Mr. CM. Palmer, M.P., said he was sure they would all agree with him in offering their heartfelt and sincere thanks to Mr. Thomas Sheldon, for the great interest he had taking with respect to the incorporation of Jarrow, and also for the arduous duties he had fulfilled with such good"], [380, "340 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. temper and judgment, and with such advantage to the town of Jarrow as returning officer under the new charter. He would not detain them any longer, but would at once ask them to pass a vote of thanks to Mr. Thomas Sheldon. The Council then proceeded to the election of alderman, the votes being taken by ballot papers The following was the result of the voting : \u2014 W. H. Eichardson, J.P., 16 ; P. A. Berkley, 15 ; W. H. Dickinson, 14 ; M. Nixon, 14; T. Gray, 13; Thomas Sheldon, 10 (elected); B. E. Huntley, 9; C. M. Palmer, M.P., 7 ; E. Brady, 2 ; M. M. Bradley, 1 ; C. B. Barnes, 1. The gentlemen then made the usual declarations. The chairman announced that, according to the charter, three of the elected alderman would have to retire at the end of three years (1878), and it would be the duty of the Council to vote which of the six should retire first. The vote was then taken, the result being\u2014 Thomas Sheldon, 16 ; M. Nixon, 10 ; Thos. Gray, 9 ; W. H. Dickinson, 7 ; P. A. Berkley, 7 ; W. H. Eichardson, 2. The first gentlemen consequently retire from the aldermanship in 1878, but are eligible for re-election. The aldermen were then appointed to the different wards. Mr. W. H. Dickinson for the East Ward, Mr. W. H. Eichardson and Mr. M. Nixon for the Jarrow Ward, Mr. Thomas Gray for the South Ward, and Mr. P. A. Berkley and Mr. Thomas Sheldon for the West Ward, Messrs. Eichardson and Berkley were appointed presiding aldermen in their respective wards. The chairman then said the most important duty to per form would be the election of the first Mayor of the borough of Jarrow. Mr. Aid, W. H. Eichardson said he had very great pleasure in rising to make a motion, which he had no doubt would be carried unanimously, and that was that Mr. Charles Mark Palmer be Mayor for the first year. It was with great pleasure that he first heard that Mr. Palmer was willing to take the position. It was in every way fitting that the founder of modern Jarrow should be its first Mayor. The founder of old Jarrow was not so well known, as no one knew who the Eoman warrior was that built the Eoman station from which the stones were taken to built the monastery at Jarrow. Eegarding modern Jarrow, Mr. Palmer had just claims to be called its founder, seeing that it was his genius that selected it as the site for the great works carried on there, and his enterprise and skill arranged and constructed these works which were unequalled in the kingdom \u2014 works where the raw material went in at one end and the finished vessel was turned out at the other end. He knew no other sight in the world equal to it, and gentlemen from foreign countries who had been shown over the works had expressed their astonishment and surprise at those works. It was the genius of Mr. Palmer that conceived that idea and carried it out, and to that genius Jarrow owed its existence. For these rea sons and also from the fact that Mr. Palmer was in every way fitted for the office, he had pleasure in moving the motion. He was sorry Mr. Palmer would not, unfortunately, be able to attend so frequently as could be desired, but his name and position would"], [381, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 341 prove a very great benefit to the town of Jarrow. Therefore he had very great pleasure in moving that Charles Mark Palmer be the first Mayor of Jarrow. The motion was then carried unanimously. The Mayor-Elect said it was his first duty, as it was his pleasure, to return to them his sincere and heartfelt thanks for the honour they had conferred upon him by electing him the first Mayor of that town. He need not tell them that before he consented to undertake the office that it required great consideration, but he felt that Jarrow had special claims upon him to undertake the im portant duties that naturally devolved upon the first Mayor. So after consulting his own feelings, and taking the opinions of others, he felt compelled to undertake the office, although he felt he would not be able to discharge them in so satisfactory a manner as he could have desired. In the first place he had not had the experi ence in municipal matters that was required, and as they were all well aware, his other duties, both private and public, required him to devote great portions of his time and anxieties to them. How ever, so far as lay in his power, he would endeavour to fulfil the duties which they had laid upon him that day in such a way as to forward the interests ofthe Corporation of Jarrow in every possible way. VVhen he determined to accede to the request to become the first Mayor of that borough, he determined to take the most con stitutional mode of entering the Council and approaching that position. He at once appealed to the ratepayers of Jarrow, in order that they might say themselves whether he should enter that Coun cil, and the result of that appeal was most flattering to himself, as it was, he trusted, satisfactory to them. He was pleased to see that the first vote they had been called upon to give, in the election of aldermen, that they acted in a disinterested and inde pendent way. It was a way which augured well for the future of Jarrow, as they all felt that to be an alderman required duties and time which he could not give, and he thought they had acted judi ciously iu the el ctions they had made. From the importance to which Jarrow had risen \u2014 -it having now upwards of 30,000 inhabi tants \u2014 the time had arrived when its affairs should be governed by a Corporation in every possible manner. The wants of the people had to be looked to, and the sanitary arrangements had to be in vestigated in the most efficient way, and he considered that this could best be done by a Corporation. Jarrow in other ways had risen in importance. It had now a railway connection with the whole district, which they would remember when the Local Board was established it had not. In those days they had very poor rail way accommodation indeed, and some might perhaps think that he was somewhat to blame for that ; but when he felt that Jarrow required better railway accommodation, he promoted a new railway the Durham Bailway\u2014 and he would not withdraw that bill until the railway company undertook to make proper railway communi cation with Jarrow. Since that time, too, they were not dependent for their prosperity upon one large works, but now they had in"], [382, "342 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. their midst many large and important works, which gave a differ ent character and added to the importance of the town. Another thing justified them in the steps they had taken. The rateable value justified them, seeing that it was now about \u00a360,000. Besides, it was found when a town became incorporated, that its influence and dignity were greater, and its powers were enlarged. He impressed upon* them the advisability of conducting their busi ness in an economical manner. They were already greatly indebted to Mr. W. S. Daglish for the manner in which the charter had been obtained, it having oily cost \u00a3300, including \u00a3 170 for fees ; and he threw out a hint that a few gentlemen might raise that sum amongst them, and so relieve the burden from the shoulders of the ratepayers. In conclusion, the Mayor urged upon them to conduct the business of the Council with good temper and feeling, and to cheerfully comply with the ruling of the chairman ; and again thanked them for the honour they had done him. \u2014 The Mayor then declared that there was a vacancy of a councillor in the East, South, Jarrow, and West Wards of the borough, owing to the election of a councillor from each ward to the aldermanic bench. It was resolved to appoint Mr. W. S. Daglish Town Clerk for the first twelve months. Other minor officers having been appointed, the Council resolved to memorialise Her Majesty to grant a Commission of the Peace for Jarrow, and the meeting separated, being afterwards entertained by the Mayor. September 7. \u2014 An extensive sale of property, by Mr. Brough, auctioneer, took place at the Queen's Head Hotel, Newcastle, by order of the Court of Chancery, made in the cause of \" Walters v. Walters.\" The property was situated in Newcastle, Gateshead, and North Shields. Notwithstanding that two of the most im portant lots did not reach the reserve price, the sum of \u00a314,820 was realized by the sale. September 10.\u2014 The Mayor of Morpeth (Mr. Eobt. Wilkinson) laid the foundation-stone of a Grand Stand for the Morpeth Eace course, in the presence of a large concourse of spectators, including some of the most influential gentlemen of the county. September 12. \u2014 The foundation-stone of a new Catholic Church was solemnly blessed by the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, at Burnopfield, near Marley Hill. The day being fine, abont 5,000 persons assembled to witness the ceremony. There was a procession on a grand scale formed by all the members of the congregation, the little girls in white dresses carrying beautiful banners. September 16. \u2014 Died, in the county of Northumberland, Charles Wm. Orde, of Nunnykirk. The melancholy event took place, somewhat unexpectedly, about one o'clock in the afternoon. The family of Orde is one of great antiquity in the annals of the North. Simon de East Orde, county Durham, died 1362 ; William de Orde died 1399 ; while John de Orde owned large properties at Norham in the time of Bishop Langley. Wm. Orde, of Western Newbiggin,"], [383, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 343 was High Sheriff of Northumberland in the fifth year of Charles I . Tn 1713, Wm. Orde was M.P. for Berwick. John Orde, son of Thomas, married Ann, daughter of Edward Ward, Esq., of Morpeth, upon whom additional estates devolved, viz , East Orde, Norham, Grindon, &c. Nunnykirk formerly belonged to the Wards of Morpeth, and was conveyed to the Orde family through a paternal grandmother, who was also a Ward. For centuries the family of Ordes have been conspicuous in the army, the navy, the Church, and the magistracy, and extensive owners of domains on the Borders, as well as in Durham and Northumberland. The gentleman whose death we record was born in 1810, so that he was in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He was the son of Charles Orde, Esq., and was educated at University College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A* in 1831, and took the degree of M.A. a few years afterwards. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, in 1842, and in the same year he succeeded to the estate of Nunnykirk, on the death of his uncle, Wm. Orde, Esq. Mr. Orde was married in 1853 to Frances Isabel, youngest daughter of Shallcross Jackson, Esq., of Newton Bank, Cheshire, who survived him. Their family consisted of three sous and two daughters, and the estates passed to bis eldest son Wm. Orde, whose majority was celebrated with considerable rejoicings only a few weeks prior to his father's death. September 27. \u2014 There was celebrated at Darlington, with be- coming pomp and circumstance, the Jubilee of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Bailway \u2014 the first public railway in the world on which steam locomotion was employed. The sum of \u00a35,000 was voted by the Bailway Company towards defraying the necessary expenses, and this was supplemented by a further vote of \u00a31,000 by the Corporation of Darlington, in addition to a free allowance of gas for the illuminations. Invitations were issued to the members of Her Majesty's Government, to the members of the former Government of Mr. Gladstone, to the leading officials of the chief railway companies in the world, to the peers, bishops, and members of Parliament on the North-Eastern system, to the Mayors and Town Clerks between Berwick and the southern termini of the North-Eastern Bailway, to the members of the Darlington Town Council, to the representatives of the Chambers of Commerce, scientific institutions, and other organisations throughout the North of England, and to the principals of the leading commercial firms in Durham, Northumberland, and North Yorkshire. Altogether 1,400 invitations were sent out, and of that number, more than 900 were accepted. An effort was made to secure the presence of Boyalty, but owing to the limited time at disposal, the attendance of a member of the Eoyal family could not be arranged for. The programme of the celebration embraced an exhibition of locomotives at tbe North Eoad Engine Works, Darlington ; the unveiling of a statue erected to the memory of Mr. Joseph Pease, the presentation to the town of a portrait of that gentleman, a banquet on a scale of great magnificence, and excursions to different works 9 s"], [384, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875- 344 and places of interest on the Stockton and Darlington Bailway. No pains had been spared to make the welcome pleasant, as well as splendid. Banners, bands, triumphal arches, towering flag staffs streaming with gay flags, constituted the day's aspect of the festival ; and when night drew on, a thousand guests sat down to dine as best they could, elegantly, and, in a qualified sense, sump tously. Then came the pyrotechnical display, and the illuminations and the lime lights, of itself enough to turn night into day. But the proper business ot the day was the unveiling of two memorials, the one inscribed with the name of Pease, the other inscribed with the immortal name of Stephenson. The first portion of the day's proceedings in which the public were directly interested was the procession of the municipal bodies, directors of the North-Eastern Bailway, guests of the company, and friendly societies to the North Eoad Engine Works, where Mr. Leeman, M.P., was to inaugurate the exhibition of engines and rolling stock held in con nection with the jubilee. The various bodies gathered together in the Market Place, and the following is the order of procession : \u2014 Banner, and Mounted Inspectors of Police. Band of the Darlington Bifle Volunteers. Municipal Flag of the Darlington Corporation. Municipal Flag of the South Shields Corporation. Municipal Flag of the Gateshead Corporation. Municipal Flag ofthe York Corporation. Municipal Flag of the Middlesborough Corporation. Sword, Mace, and Wand of the City of York. The Lord Mayor of York and the Mayor of Darlington. The Sheriff of York and the Ex-Mayor of Darlington. Mace-Bearer of the City of Bipon. The Mayor of Bipon and the Mayor of Berwick-on-Tweed. The Mace and Swoid ofthe Borough of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The Mayor of Newcastle and the Mayor of Durham. The Mayor of Doncaster aud the Mayor of Scarborough. The Mayor of Gateshead and the Mayor of Carlisle. Corporation of Darlington. Directors of the North-Eastern Bailway Company. Members of the Pease Memorial Committee. Town Clerks, Aldermen, aud Councillors of neighbouring cities and boroughs, invited guests, and officials of the North-Eastern Bailway Company. Temperance Societies, Free Gardeners, Ancient Order of Foresters ; Oddfellows : Kingston Unity. Independendent Order, and Manchester Unity ; Smiths, Druids, Stone Masons. The great procession which had marched from the Market Place to the exhibition of locomotives at the North Boad Engine Works, there broke into two parts. The directors of the N.E B., with their guests and officials, and the members of the Pease Memorial Committee, proceeded through the exhibition, whilst the Friendly Societies, Smiths, Foresters, Druids, &c returned by various routes"], [385, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 345 to Darlington in order to take part in another procession, which was yet to be organised, on the arrival of the Lord Mayor of Lon- don Section by section the various bodies reached the Victoria Boad, where they were placed on either side of the thoroughfare in order to close in when the head of the new procession should have passed by. Here they were joined by the Darlington Volunteers, who marched up to the head of the road, and took up position close to the station gates ; whilst the friendly societies lined the avenue almost as far as the Grange Eoad. Inside the Bank Top Station an immense crowd had assembled, notwithstanding the efforts of the railway company's servants to exclude all who had no business inside the building. At length the people came down in great force, and pressed through the gates, almost defeating the exertions of the officials to retain an open space in which the expected visi- tors might be received. Amongst the gentlemen present were the members of the municipal corporations, and directors of the North- Eastern Bailway Company, and also the Marquis of Londonderry, the Marquis of Bipon, Lord Wenlock, Earl Cathcart, the Hon. Waldegrave Leslie, Mr. Leeman, M P., Mr. Joseph Dodds, M.P., Mr. W. H. James, M.P., Sir John Kennaway, Bart., Mr. Whitwell, of Kendal ; Mr John Holmes, M P., Sir Henry Havelock, Bart., and Lady Havelock, Lieut. Ernest White, Deputy Chief Constable of Durham County, the Dean of Durham, Eev. Dr. Lake ; Major Beaumont, Mr. H. W. P. Bolckow, M.P., Mr. Grosvenor Hodgson, Mr. Jos. Laycock, jun , Mr. J. W. Pease, M.P., Sir John Swiuburne, Bart., &c. The train in which the Lord Mayor and his suite travelled was pretty well up to time, but there was very little ofthe impressive in the manner in which his lordship was received. A saloon carriage dashed up to the front of the platform, and the crowd surged right in upon it, bringing the Mayor of Darlington in very close proximity to the doorway. Lord Mayor Stone was lustily cheered as he stepped on to the platform, and was quickly conducted to one of the waiting rooms of the station in order to vest himself in his official robes before proceeding to take part in the ceremony of the day. Here a long delay occurred. Three carriages and pairs had been drawn up to the front porch of the station, and stood so loDg unoccupied, that the crowd began to imagine that the visitors had made their exit by some other means of egress. The Lord Mayor was known to be ready vested, his friends were waiting, and at last it transpired that the hitch arose in consequence of the unexpected absence of his lordship's trumpeters, who were nowhere to be found. The detective super intendent of the railway police was applied to, but that gentleman had not seen the missing musicians in any part of the station, and tbe conclusion was arrived at that they had been forwarded to Newcastle instead of being disembarked at Darlington with the rest of the party. But whilst the officer just mentioned was hastily making for the telegraph office to despatch a messenger northwards the four trumpeters suddenly made their appearance on the plat-"], [386, "346 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. form, and a move was at once made to the carriages. Tbe four trumpeters, in tunics of scarlet and gold, with black velvet caps, led the way, blowing a lively fanfare, followed by the Lord Mayor of Londou in his official scarlet, aud wearing the fur cap of office, the Mayor of Darlington, Mr. Leeman, M.P., Mr. Henry Pease, Mr. J. W. Pease, M.P., the Mayor of Hull, the Lord Mayor's secretary, and others. Those gentlemen took their seats in the private carriages that were waiting, and preceded by the volunteers and followed by the friendly societies, who closed in regular order as the carriages passed by, they proceeded down the Victoria Eoad on their way to the site of the Pease memorial. The spectacle as the procession streamed down the declivity towards the cricket field was by far the finest sight of the day. The sun was shining brightly, and the glow of colours from the banners, with the Vene tian masts and streamers on each side of the road, combined to produce an effect which was not approached in any other portion of the festivities. The procession, accompanied by an immense crowd of people, proceeded by Grange Eoad to the Market Place, through which, after some difficulty, an avenue was formed for the Lord Mayor and other guests to take their place at the foot of the statue, the unveiling ceremony of which was then transacted. A banquet was afterwards held, which was on a scale of great magnificence. The grand marquee was designed to seat 950 guests. Its length was about 200 feet, and its breath something near 80. At either end there was a raised platform, hung with crimson and ornamented with gold. One of these platforms was entirely de voted to ladies, and the other, by some infelicitous arrangement, was divided between the ladies and the band. The raised tables which were designed to accommodate the Chairman, the Vice- Chairman, and the more distinguished guests, were erected one on each side of the tent. These tables were laid and decorated in the most handsome style. In the centre there was a superb dish of fruit, which rose in pyramidal form, and was crowned by a splendid pine apple. Elegant mirrors, slightly raised, lay on each side of these dishes, and they were planted round with ferns and evergreens, which reflected themselves in the smooth surface. By the skill of the confectioner, these tables illustrated fifty years of engineering progress. The old \" No. 1\" engine, with all its structural curio- sities and its feeble prophecies of the growth and the future great- ness of engineering skill, was presented in opposition to the railway engine of to-day, with its almost perfect workmanship, and its more than fulfilment of all that w*as imagined or believed. The disad- vantages which are ordinarily attendant on speaking in tents were ingeniously provided against. Behind the chairman and vice- chairman spacious sounding-boards were erected. These, also, had been made a part of the decorations, and converted into handsome canopies. Here, again, were illustrations of railway enterprise and engineering skill. The canopies were surmounted by a cornice on which was represented the \" No. 1\" engine and its modern com-"], [387, "A.D. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 347 peer. Above them were placed the respective dates to which they belonged, and between them the motto of the old Stockton and Darlington Bailway Company, in white letters on a deep purple ground, \" Periculum privatum, utilitas publica.\" The marquee contained thirty-four tables, besides those which were devoted to the chair and the vice-chair. Eighteen of these were ranged in a double row in the centre of the marquee, eight others crossed at either end, and between them all there was an amplitude of space. On each table bloomed rare exotics, and the gorgeous bouquets which stood in glass receptacles at short distances from each other lent to the marquee the fragrance and the appearance of a hot house. A tolerably accurate idea of the richness and the variety of the viands provided may be gained from the following bill of tare : \u2014 POTAGES. Tortue et Tortue Claire. Gibier Julienne. RELEVES.

As was fitting so grand an occasion, the vast assemblage was both brilliant and distinguished. Perhaps on no former occasion has so large a gathering of individuals interested in the commercial, social, and political life of the country been witnessed in the North of England as that which took place in the marquee. After the tables had been cleared, the Chairman (Mr. Leeman, M.P.) pro posed the health of \" Her Majesty the Queen,\" followed by the healths of their Eoyal Highnesses \" The Prince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of the Eoyal Family.\" The Chairman then gave the \"Clergy,\" coupled with the \" The Dean of Durham.\" The Dean of Durham responded.

The Earl of Feversham proposed the health of \" Her Majesty's Ministers.\" Sir Charles Adderley M.P. replied. Sir Frederick Peel proposed \" The House of Lords and the House of Commons.\" The Duke of Cleveland, K G., replied on behalf of the House of Lords, and Mr. J. W. Pease, for the House of Commons. Lord Wenlock proposed the health ofthe whole of the \" Municipal Authorities assembled, and in particular the Lord Mayor of London, and the Mayor of Darlington.'' The Lord Mayor of London, and the Mayor of Darlington returned thanks. The Marquis of Bipon proposed \" The Civil Engineers'.\" Mr. T. E. Harrison, President of the Institute of Civil Engineers' replied. The Eight Honourable Lord Provost proposed the health of \" The Chairman,\" and after tbe Chairman's reply, the proceedings of the banquet concluded. The display of fireworks arranged by the North Eastern Bailway Company, and executed by Messrs. C. T. Brock and Co., pyrotechnists to the Crystal Palace, took place in a field adjoining Victoria Eoad, and near to the North-Eastern Bailway Station, and was witnessed by many thousand spectators. The following was the programme : \u2014 1. \u2014 Salute of 50 serial maroons. 2. \u2014 Illumination by 50 large Crystal Palace lights. 3. \u2014 Revolving devices and cloud of jewels and stars discharged from 25 shells. 4.- Special device, the No. 1 Engine. 5. \u2014 Batteries of saucissens. 6. \u2014 Revolving wheels, 16 feet in diameter.

J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 349 In addition to Darlington being the first centre of railway travelling, there are numerous articles in use on railways which owe the origin of their birth to that town. Amongst others, is that of the railway wagon, the first of which was manufactured by Mr. Wm. Lister, at the Tubwell Bow Foundry, and conveyed by horses to the railway. The same gentleman was the first and only person who ever contracted to carry passengers in a train consisting wholly of carriages, by steam. This was in the year 1836, and the contract stipulated that the rate should not exceed 7^d. per mile, and that the contractor should provide his own engines, enginemen, oil, &c, and keep the engines in proper repair. What rapid strides the North of England has made in the march of pro gress since that period may be judged, when it is stated that at that time a train consisting of four carriages ran to and from Stockton three times a day ; whilst, at the present time, there are six times that number of trains, each one containing an average of treble the number of carriages. The foundry of Mr. Lister is still in existence at Hope Town, Darlington, and is carried on, with increased prosperity, by Mr. Chas. E. Lister, a grandson of the above gentleman. October 2. \u2014 Viscount Castlereagh, son of the Marquis of London derry, was married, at Alton Towers, to Lady Theresa, eldest daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury. October 6. \u2014 The inhabitants of Sunderland paid a fitting and appropriate tribute to departed worth by inaugurating a statue, in the beautiful park, to Mr. Alderman John Candlish, who was twice Mayor of the borough, and represented it in Parliament from the beginning of 1 866 till the dissolution by Mr. Gladstone in the beginning of 1874. The ceremony was to have been performed by Mr. Aid Gourlay, M.P., the colleague of Mr. Candlish in the Par liamentary representation of that town ; but as that gentleman had to leave for India a few days before, the duty devolved upon the junior member of the borough, Sir Henry Marshman Havelock, Bart., M.P., who succeeded to the seat left vacant by the death of Mr. Candlish. The demonstration was most successful, and those who took part in it vied with each other in their endeavours to render it in every way worthy of the occasion, and to testify their regard for the memory of their deceased friend. October 7.\u2014 The foundation-stone of a new church for the parish of St. Thomas, Westoe district, South Shields, was laid by Sir George Elliot, Bart., M.P., who was surrounded on the occasion by a large company. The church is built in the decorated style of Gothic architecture. The proceedings commenced with devotional exercises, by the Bev. E. T. Butchard and the Eev. Mr. Bell, when Sir George, after the customary mauner, performed the cere mony, and declared the stone duly laid. October 19. \u2014 The steamship Britannia, which traded between"], [390, "350 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1875. Newcastle and Leith, went ashore at Holy Island, this morning. The weather being very boisterous and stormy, the captain determined to run for Holy Island Harbour, but on doing so, the vessel struck on the bar, and became a total wreck. Fortunately, no lives were lost. October 21. \u2014 Died, at Westoe, near South Shields, aged 82 years, Mr. Bobert Ingham, Q.C., formerly M.P. for South Shields. Mr. Mr. Ingham was born in Bigg Market, Newcastle, in the year 1793. He was the son of Mr. William Ingham, a well-known sur geon. His mother was Jane, daughter of Bobert Walker, Esq., of Westoe. He received his education at the famed Harrow School, and finished his educational training in Oriel College, Oxford, where, in 1815, he took his degree, and came out first-class in classical honours. In 1818, he graduated M.A., and was a fellow of Oriel for some years. He chose the law as his profession, and while holding his fellowship he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, but in 1820 he removed to the Inner Temple, of which he became a bencher. The Government recognised his judicial talents by appointing him recorder of Berwick and making him a Q.C. in 1851. Mr. Ingham was also appointed Attorney-General for the County Palatine of Durham, \u2014 an office which he held some years, but resigned in 1861. Mr. Ingham, who through his mother's family became connected with South Shields, and resided at Westoe, on the estate which he inherited from his maternal grandfather, took great interest in the enfranchisement of that borough; and during the passing of the Beform Bill of 1832, he united with the people of that town in making good its claim for a member in the redistri bution of seats which then took place. These efforts were success ful. South Shields was among the new representations, and Mr. Ingham now aspired to the honourable position of a Member of Parliament. South Shields was the borough he sought to represent in the reformed Parliament; but he had to win his honour by a hard contest, as candidates were numerous. Mr. Ingham at that time held moderate Conservative notions. He was a kind of Liberal-Conservative, though that designation was not known at that time. The Badicals, not satisfied with the Eeform Bill, brought Captain Gowan (afterwards Captain Manlever) down to Shields to oppose Mr. Ingham, and he was well supported by Mr. Hume, the celebrated financial reformer, who had along with him Mr. Eoland Detrosier, of London, secretary of the National Politi cal Union. Besides Mr. Ingham and Capt. Gowan, there were other two candidates for the suffrages of the people Although Mr. Ingham was of Conservative tendencies, he did not quite meet the wishes of the Shields shipowners, who thought they ought to have a representative of their own ; and they therefore brought a strong protectionist and Tory in the person of Mr. George Palmer, a London shipowner. The fourth candidate was Mr. Bussel Bowlby, a member of an old Shields family. The borough was in a very excited state for some weeks ; but the great personal"], [391, ""], [392, "Oisa.mh.vtki) Door w a v W&1AT l^ILJkMJD M From the \\\\z"], [393, ")F LlSlDISfARi'; OK Vest ."], [394, ""], [395, "A.D. 1875. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 351 qualities of Mr. Ingham in spite, of all the personalities, carried him ultimately to the head of the poll. The polling took place on the 12th, the result being as follows -\u2014Ingham, 205 ; Palmer, 108 ; Gowan, 105 ; Bowlby, 2. This was a great triumph for Mr. Ingh-\u00a3m, as he polled within a few votes as many as his three an tagonists put together. In the many contests which took place from that date up to 1868, Mr. Ingham sat (excepting a period of ten years) as member for North Shields. In the above year he retired from the representation of North Shields, owing to failing health. About the same time the learned gentleman tendered his resignation of the Becordership of Berwick, which he held for nearly forty years, the Town Council of that borough on the occasion expressing their sense of the faithful manner in which he had dis charged his judicial duties, as well as admiration of his qualities as a legislator and citizen. The retirement of Mr. Ingham from active life was felt by his fellow-townsmen to be a favourable opportunity for giving tangible expression to their gratitude for his long and zealous services on their behalf. The movement set on foot for this purpose ultimately assumed the gratifying form of an Infirmary at Westoe, with which it was resolvedtpermanently to associate his name. The foundation-stone of the building was laid on the 30th of May, 1871, and the institution has been in operation, dispensing its valuable benefits to the sick and suffering of the district, ever since On the 28th the remains of Mr. Ingham were interred iu the family vault in the South Shields and Westoe Cemetery. The funeral was largely attended by relatives and the corporate bodies of Shields aud the neighbouring towns. October 26. \u2014 Shortly after one o'clock this morning, a fire was discovered to have broken out in the timber yard of Mr. Bowman, Teynham Street, Scotswood Eoad, Newcastle. A messenger was despatched to the Westgate Street Police Station for the fire-engine and other apparatus, aud every effort was made to suppress the conflagration. Notwithstanding which, damage to the amount of nearly twenty thousand pounds was the result. , October 30. \u2014 The memorial stone of the Stockton Hospital was laid by Mr. Marshall Fowler, J.P., of Preston Hall. There was a very large attendance. The hospital stands upon 2| acres of land, situated upon the west side of Bowesfield Lane, and is designed with a front in the Italian style of architecture. The ceremony was made the occasion of a great trades' and friendly societies' demonstration, in honour of Mr. Marshall Fowler, the president of the hospital, who had declined to accept a testimonial of \u00a31,000 value, in recognition of his public services, and suggested that the money should be added to the hospital funds, for additions to the hospital. The Mayor and Corporation, and other public bodies attended. November 9. \u2014 The election of Mayors for the boroughs in Nor thumberland and Durham took place to-day, when the following Tt"], [396, "352 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF A.D. 1875 gentlemen were elected to fill the office : \u2014 Newcastle, W. H. Stephenson, Esq , Mayor; Thomas Forster, Esq., Sheriff; Gateshead, William Galloway, Esq. ; Tynemouth, W. Aubone Potter, Esq. ; South Shields, Alderman Broughton (re-elected) ; Sunderland, John Nicholson, Esq. ; Durham, Joseph Ferens, Esq. ; Darlington, Edward Lucas Pease, Esq. ; Stockton, Mr. Hunton ; Hartlepool, G. Horsley, Esq. (re-elected) ; Jarrow-on-Tyne, Alderman Sheldon ; Morpeth, John Dixon, Esq. November 14. \u2014 A great part of Darlington was submerged by a flood of unprecedented\" magnitude, causing great destruction to property, and entailing upon hundreds of families the most serious hardship and inconvenience. The water began to rise rapidly between nine and ten o'clock at night, after twelve hours of almost incessant rain. During the night the water penetrated many houses, and rose so rapidly as to render all prospect of egress apparently impossible unless immediate escape were attempted. Hence the necessity was forced upon many families living in the neighbourhood of the Skerne either to seek refuge in the upper rooms of their houses, or to wander out and await the results of daylight. Both alternatives were largely adopted by the inhabi tants of Park Place, Park Street, Backhouse Street, Model Place, Swan Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Chapel Street, Skerne Bow, Valley Street, Park-gate, Clay Bow, and other thoroughfares in their vicinity. Before six o'clock in the morning most of these streets were completely under water, tbe flood covering the whole expanse of ground between Freeman's Place, along Clay Bow and Parkgate to the Black Swan, from the Parkgate end of Park Street to Victoria Boad, and from the Victoria Bridge to the Darlington Park. For the most part, the people who were drowned out had to appeal to the generosity of those who inhabited the upper part of the house, and throughout the greater part of the day these upper rooms were crowded with starved and shivering beings, whose abject condition was rendered still more deplorable by the utter impossibility of procuring access to either food or fuel. In Park Street, Church Street, Skerne Bow, and some adjoining streets, the water stood three or four feet deep in the tenements occupying the ground floor, and the destruction of property in the aggregate was considerable, and very serious for the poor unfortunates who were suffering from the depressed condition of trade. Two or three young men got hold of a boat which was usually moored near to the bridge spanning the Skerne at Parkgate, and sailed along some of the inundated streets. Early in the forenoon the Mayor (Mr. Edwin Lucas Pease), Mr. Aid. Luck, Mr. Councillor Eobinson, Mr. Councillor Foggitt, Mr. Councillor Bussell, Mr. Councillor Morrell, Mr. Councillor Bobson, and others were on the scene, and made every effort to relieve the distress. Cabs were procured, and the most necessitous were carried to the Central Hall, where fires were got ready in the lecture-room, and in one or two other rooms, for the purpose of warming and drying those who had most seriously"], [397, "ad. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 353 suffered. In the afternoon bread and coffee were supplied in the Lecture Boom to nearly five hundred men, women, and children who were excluded from their own homes, and many of whom had neither ate nor drank anything during the previous part of the day. Arrangements were also made for providing sleeping accommodation for those who could not find it for themselves. Most of them, how- ever, got quarters for the night with some friends more fortunate than themselves. Others, again, were furnished with beds at the Workhouse ; while others, who steadily refused Workhouse fare and quarter, preferred to sit up throughout the whole of the night in the rooms placed at their disposal in the Central Hall. The flood submerged the gas works to a serious extent, and did consider- able damage. About ten o'clock on the Saturday night the gas manager (Mr. Smith) found the water of the Skerne entering the gas works yard, and he took immediate precautions to prevent its entrance into the retort house by piling up clay and timber at every vulnerable point. Having done this, and made the works as far as possible secure, he retired to rest about twelve o'clock. At four o clock in the morning he rose to find that his labours of the previous night had been altogether in vain. The flood had completely submerge'! the whole of the works, drowning out all the fires, and almost completely filling the retorts. The waters began to abate in the low-lying streets abutting on the Skerne after six o'clock in the evening, and by nine o'clock next morning the majority of the inundated streets had almost resumed their wonted appearance. Their were a few exceptions to this rule, as in the case of Backhouse Street and Skerne Bow, which were not really passable until a later hour ; nor was it until the afternoon that the fields near the Skerne, including the cricket field, Feethams, and Pulain Bottoms, began to show visible signs of the flood abating. The unfortunate people who wei e compelled to leave their houses were able to resume occupation of their dwel- lings during the day. At the Gas Works, notwithstanding the water fell as rapidly as it had risen, the town was left in darkness for several days. The woollen mills of Messrs. H. Pease and Co. were unable to make a start, owing to the drowning out of the boiler fires ; and the Bridge Street Board Schools could not be opened because the water in that thoroughfare had not sufficiently abated. The train leaving Darlington at 10*18 found its passage blocked between Aycliffe and Bradbury, and was therefore com- pelled to return to Darlington, and proceed via Bishop Auckland to Newcastle. This route was made use of during the rest of the day for all trains going north, while the south trains proceeded by way of Preston Junction. The injury done to the line was so tar repaired towards evening that the mail leaving Newcastle at 7*8 was enabled lo travel by the main line, which was afterwards used with safety by all succeeding trains. The great stretch of low-lying land between Aycliffe and Bradbury was completely submerged, the vast expanse of water stretching almost as far as the eye could reach on either side of the main line."], [398, "351 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. November 17. \u2014 The King of the Belgians conferred the distin g uished honour of \" Knight ofthe Order of Leopold\" upon Christian Bruce Reid, Esq., of Newcastle, formerly Belgian Consul. The office of Consul had been held by the Reids' family for a period of nearly fifty years, the Consul at the present date being Mr. George Reid, son of the above-named gentleman. November 19. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Victoria Square, Newcastle on-Tyue, Mr. Henry Shield, aged 38 years. The deceased gentle man w as a member of the firm of Messrs. Shield, Bourne, and Co., wine merchants. It was chiefly, however, by his histrionic and literary abilities, that Mr Shield was known to the general public. As an amateur actor he had acquired considerable distinction ; and whenever any benevolent movement required assistance, his services in that capacity were most cheerfully rendered. The deceased was an exceedingly clever writer both iu prose and verse. Many of his literary contributions appeared in The Newcastle Chronicle, while a very smart aud racy poem which he composed in the cause of the boys of the Shoeblack Brigade, under the title of \" Shine yer Boots,\" was published in the pages of Punch. November 24. \u2014 This morning, ab^ut half- past four o'clock, a fire was discovered in the draughting offices of Messrs. Palmer's iron shipbuilding yard, Jarrow. Every endeavour was made to confine the fire to the locality in which it originated, but it soon extended to the store-room in which were housed a quantity of varnish, oils, paints, &c. The exertions of two fire brigades prevented the de vastating element from pursuing its destructive course .further than this, and by eight o'clock it was entirely subdued. The loss to the company was about \u00a310,000. December 3. \u2014 Her Majesty's Italian Opera Company, under the direction of Mr. J H. Mapleson, visited the Tyne Theatre and Opera House, for three nights. This evening, the eminent lyric prima donna Madame Christine Nilsson appeared for the first time on tbe operatic stage in Newcastle. The character selected for her debut was Marghenta, in Gounod's opera of \"Faust\" The perfor mance attracted the largest and most brilliant auditory that had ever assembled in a place of public amussment in our northern metro polis, the theatre being crammed to excess in all parts, and hun dreds of persons were disappointed in not obtaining admission. Madame Trebelli-Bettini aud other artistes of the first class sup ported Madame Nilsson in the opera. December 4. \u2014 Died, at Calais, in France, aged 62 years, the Eight Hon. T. E. Headlam, formerly M.P. for Newcastle. The deceased gentleman was on his way to spend the winter in Italy, on account of failing health, but got no further than Calais, where he died. Mr Headlam was the eldest son of the late Eev. John Headlam, Archdeacon of Eichmond, and Eector of Wycliffe, near Barnard Castle, and was born at Wycliffe. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge. At the latter"], [399, "a.d. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 355 place he graduated as the 6th wrangler in 1836, the same year in which Bishop Colenso was 2nd wrangler. Mr. Headlam became a member of the Inner Temple, and, after practising some years at the Chancery Bar, he was in the year 1852 appointed as one of Her Majesty's counsel. Two years afterwards he was elected Chancellor of Durham and Bipon by the bishops of those dioceses. Although living in comparative retirement, Mr. Headlam devoted considerable attention to the passing political events ; and on the dissolution of Parliament in July, 1847, he was suggested as an eligible candidate for the representation of Newcastle, in the Liberal interest. To the appeal addressed to him Mr. Headlam accorded a ready and hearty response. He promptly appeared in the field ; and although, to use his own words, he came, to a great extent, as a stranger, he met with a cordial and most enthusiastic reception. On the day of nomination, which was the 28th of July, 1847, Mr. W. Ord was proposed by Mr. Aid. Potter, and seconded by Mr. John Thomas Carr ; while Mr. Headlam was nominated by Mr. Aid. Lamb, his seconder being Mr John Bayne. The show of hands was in favour of the two Liberal champions, and the public voice was ratified by the poll which terminated next day with the following result : \u2014 Ord (Liberal;, 2.196; Headlam -'Liberal), 2,008; Hodgson (Con servative, 1,680. Similar success again attended Mr. Headlam at the general elections in 1852 and 1857, but on both occasions he had to encounter opposition. On the former occasion he was returned along with Mr. Blackest, and on the latter with Mr. George Eidley. The next election took place on the defeat of Lord Derby's Ministry in 1859. Once more Mr. Eeadlam had to face opposition, but again he was successful, and was returned in company with Mr. Eidley. Immediately after the new Parlia ment assembled, and an Administration having been formed by Lord Palmerston, Mr. Headlam was elevated to the office of Judge- Advocate General. He was again returned, and represented Newcastle in Parliament up to 1874, when he was defeated by Mr. Chas. F. Hamond. His death was a matter of no small regret to his friends in this town, of which he Lad made many. December 6. \u2014 A stipendiary magistrate having been appointed for the borough of North Shields, that gentleman took his seat on the bench this morning, and was welcomed by the bar and a large portion of the magistrates of the town. December 9. \u2014 A tragic affair occurred at the village of Dinning ton, a few miles from Newcastle. A party of men had been out shooting during the day, and adjourned to a public-house after the sport was over. On the way home the men got skylarking and pelting snowballs at each other, when this conduct so exasperated one of them named George Hunter, that he levelled his gun at a man named Wood and fired, the result being almost instantaneous death. Hunter, when he saw what he had done, called loudly for assistance, aud endeavoured to minister to the wants of his dying"], [400, "356 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. comrade, but without avail. He was taken into custody, and committed to the assizes for wilful murder, but the general impression of the public was that the sad affair was the result of an accident. December 10. \u2014 In a sequestered spot in Bowes Churchyard, were interred in the family vault, the mortal remains of the Bight Hon. Thomas Emerson Headlam, formerly M.P. for Newcastle. The funeral was of a strictly private character. At half past two, the procession left Gilmonby Hall, the weather being intensely severe. The principal mourners were Mr. Morley Headlam, J. P. ; the Eev. A. M Headlam, Vicar of Whorlton ; Mr. E. Headlam, stipendary magistrate at Manchester ; and Mr. Francis Headlam, brothers of the deceased ; Colonel Van Straubenzie, brother-in-law ; Mr. John Spedding and Mr. Henry Spedding, nephews ; and Mr. Bobert Morley, cousin to the right honourable gentleman. There were also present Mr. W. Watson, Startforth Hall ; Mr. T. D. Holmes, Captain Home, Dr. Munroe, Barnard Castle ; the Eev. T. Witham, Lartington Hall, and the tenants and employees on the estate. The outer coffin was covered with black velvet, and on the breast plate was the following inscription : \u2014 T. E. Headlam, born 1813. Died, 1875. December 11. \u2014 At the Durham Assizes a youth was charged with highway robbery of a most aggravated type in and around Durham. The prisoner was but 18 years of age, but the calendar showed his career of crime to have been a notorious one. He had fallen into the hands of the police at the early age of 13, and from that period had been the greater part of his time in prison. He was now sentenced to penal servitude for life, a sentence which seemed to take him very much by surprise. December 11. \u2014 A daring attempt was made to commit a burglary at the house of the Eev. Joseph Benedict Murphy, Catholic priest, at Cowpen, near Blyth, this evening, and the attempt was made unsuccessful only by the courage of the clerical gentleman, who had a desperate struggle with the burglar. Between eleven and twelve o'clock Mr Murphy was sitting in a rooom reading his devotions and preparing for the Sunday, when he thought he heard a stealthy footstep on the carpeted landing. He laid aside the book, armed himself with the poker, and quietly went to the room door. He opened it suddenly, and sure enough there stood in the passage a stout-looking man, who had left his boots outside and had got into the house in his stockings. The burglar at tempted to seize hold of Mr. Murphy, but that gentleman quickly let him feel the weight of the poker across the shoulders. A desperate fight then took place between the two, and some of the furniture about was totally smashed. After a tough fight the burglar^ managed to get out of Mr. Murphy's grasp, and quickly disappeared through the window by which he had gained entrance,"], [401, "a.d. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 357 only, however, to fall into the hands of a policeman, who had been drawn to the house by the cries for help. His boots were found outside the window which he had broken open. It was found that the poker Mr. Murphy had used had left its mark upon the shoulders and head of the burglar. Mr. Murphy himself was pretty severely bruised, especially on the arms, one of which was nearly broken. December 15.\u2014 This morning, the dead bodies of a man and woman were discovered in a water-course at Elwick, near Hartle- pool. The man was lying with his face downwards, and the woman on her back, both clear ofthe water. Three small bottles of spirits were found m the pockets of the deceased, who were identified\u2014 the man as having been employed on the new line of railway at Elwick, and the woman as the wife of another navvy. December 18.\u2014 A miner named Thomas Green, accompanied by his son, a lad of some twelve years, was proceeding from Shotton Colliery to Haswell, and when passing Shotton Church he picked up on the footpath a curious looking ihing resembling a lead pencil. After examining it slightly he handed it to his son, who drew his attention to a split at one end of it, and on the lad picking this with a pin some milky-white looking fluid oozed out into the hollow of his hand. An instant after, and without any warning, the curious looking thing burst with a loud explosion, blowing off the finger and thumb by which the youth was holding it at the time, one portion of it narrowly missing the side of bis head as it flew past. The lad afterwards received medical assistance. What the nature of tbe article Green picked up was could not be even guessed at. December 18. \u2014 Akeelman, named James Hepplewhite, belonging to Shields, illtreated his wife in such a brutal manner as to cause her death. The prisoner had gone home the night previously about nine o'clock iu a state of drunkenness, and commenced to quarrel with his wife, winding up his argumentative powers by knocking her off the chair on to the floor. The poor woman seems to have recovered from that attack and seated herself again in the chair at the foot of the bed in the room, when the prisoner renewed the attack, and gave her a terrific blow in the face, which knocked her on the floor and blackened her eye in a frightful manner, aud followed up his savage assault by again striking her with his fist about the head until she fell on to the floor in a state of insen sibility. Having satisfied himself with his inhuman conduct, he called upon his son William (a lad only twelve years of age, and who was in the house during the whole of the brutal assaults to pull off his clothes so that he might go to bed. The little fellow did so, and the parent went to bed, whereupon the poor woman, who was lying on the floor, asked her son to get a wet cloth to put about her head, as it was very sore ; but the prisoner hearing the request, refused to allow the lad to assist his mother, but made him"], [402, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 358 get into bed. The little fellow lay at the back of the bed, next the wall, the prisoner lying in the centre, and the mother after a little while approached the bed, and crawled on towards the outside, when he cried out, \" Don't go there, you b .\" She, however, got into bed, and after a few words of anger, he eventually knocked her out of bed on to the floor. The pror woman lay on the floor where she fell from that time, about eleven o'clock on Friday night, until the following morning, moaning heavily. In the morning the prisoner departed to follow his usual vocation, without taking the slightest notice of his wife. On his departure, the son informed some neighbours, who discovered the poor woman in a dying state. She lingered until about one o'clock, when she died. The prisoner was committed for trial on the capital charge. December 19. \u2014 This morning, the dead body of a man named John Armstrong Forster, was found in the Team Gut at Dunston. It was supposed that on the preceding night, the deceased had been crosssing the railway bridge which spans the Gut, and had dropped through a hole into the water beneath. The bridge was not in tended for foot passengers at all. There were bruises on the face and throat of the deceased. December 23. \u2014 This morning, at eight o'clock, within the pre cincts of the Newcastle Gaol, the last dread sentence of the law was carried out upon John William Anderson, who was convicted at the Newcastle Winter Assizes of the murder of his wife, Elizabeth Anderson, in Mitford Street, on the 28th of August last. The convict, who was thirty-two years old, and respectably con nected, had been a private in the 98th Begiment, and a short time previously to the committal of the deed for which he was sentenced to death, held a clerk's situation. With his wifo and one son he resided in Mitford Street, an elder son, nine years of age, living with Anderson's mother. According to the evidence given at the trial both the prisoner and his wife were apparently on good terms with each other only a few moments before the murder. This friendly feeling, however, was not general between them, for they had been heard for about two years to quarrel repeatedly. The deceased woman, though not an habitual drunkard, was sometimes, it was stated in evidence, given to liquor, although her father during the trial contradicted the assertion. On the evening of the 28th they were neither of them sober, and the beginning of the fatal disagreement took place apparently immediately after they reached home and the shop was closed. Then the deceased woman was heard to say to her husband, \" You won't lock the boy out.\" The door was then opened, and Anderson came towards the lad, who retreated from him and began to cry, upon which the prisoner went back and shut the door. The wife then remonstrated again with her husband, and is reported to have announced her intention of going out and bringing the child in herself. This Anderson refused to let her do, and apparently provoked by his conduct she"], [403, "a.d. 1875.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 359 struck him. A short scuffling was heard, and the prisoner threatened if his wife hit him again to stab her. This awful threat he only too effectually carried out, for soon afterwards two screams were heard, the latter of which died away into a heavy moan. He then went to the police station and gave himself up. At the trial the jury recommended him to mercy, but the prisoner stated in court that he did not deserve the clemency of the law, and wished to die. Numerous petitions were got up in his favour, but the Home Secretary declined to interfere, and the law was allowed to take its course this morning. Anderson died without exhibiting the slightest fear, and seemed thoroughly reconciled to his awful fate. This was the first execution within the walls of Newcastle Gaol. December 23. \u2014 This morning Bichard Charlton was executed in Morpeth Gaol for the murder of his wife, Sarah Charlton, on the 5th of June last (which see.) The prisoner inflicted serious wounds upon himself, and was unable to be present at the Summer Assizes. At the Winter Assizes he was found guilty and sentenced to death. After his conviction there was a very general feeling of sympathy with tbe condemned man prevalent in the district, and a largely signed memorial to the Home Secretary praying for his respite was forwarded. The reasons set forth by the memorialists for asking for his reprieve were that, in the first place, he had been provoked in a great measure to the commission of the rash act by the treat ment which he had received at the hands of his wife and her relatives, and in the second, that he was so feeble and paralysed that it appeared an act of cruelty to take away what little of life remained in his maimed body. The members of the press were excluded, and what information they possessed was gained from the officials. The black flag was hoisted at eight o'clock, and the numerous assemblage outside of Morpeth Gaol then knew that the last dread sentence of the law had been carried into effect. December 24. \u2014 Mr. James Grant, a poet and author of some note in the North of England, died in London. The deceased gentle man resided for many years in Sunderland. He published a volume of poems under the title of \" Madonna Pia and other Poems,\" was a dramatic author, and contributed articles to various magazines and local newspapers. His genial disposition and courteous manners made him friends on all hands. December 27. \u2014 A Working Mens' Club was inaugurated at Aln wick by bis Grace the Duke of Northumberland. The affair was very successful, upwards of 100 persons having joined. December 27.\u2014 This evening, an extremely handsome building, to be used as a Free Gardeners' Hall, was opened in Prudhoe Street, North Shields. December 27.\u2014 An explosion occurred on board of a steamship lying in Sunderland Docks, by which a man named John Doyle was killed on the spot, and several injured. u u"], [404, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1875. 360 December 28. \u2014This afternoon, an inquest was held at Kelloe Colliery, on the body of Bobert Kennam, who was found dead in Garmondsway Lime Quarry, on the 26th inst., under somewhat peculiar circumstances. Deceased had been drinking during the afternoon of Christmas Day, and about five o'clock he went out saying that he was going to have a walk with two dogs. Later on the same evening a constable found him standing near Coxhoe Mill half asleep, and advised him to go home, to Kelloe Colliery, which he consented to do, and he went through the wood towards that place. Next day his body was found in Garmondsway Quarry, and it is supposed that having taken a wrong turn in the wood he had fallen into the quarry, and marks of blood on the ledge above where his body was found, together with other appearances on the face of the cliff, went to confirm this supposition. December 28. \u2014 Three men left Stockton in a small boat this afternoon, for the purpose of proceeding down the river on a shoot ing excursion. One of the men, named Davis, an ironworker, got out on to a sand bank in the centre of the river, when the boat became unmanageable with the two remaining occupants, and drifted out to sea. The poor fellow Davis was surrounded by the rising tide, and was drowned. The occupants of the boat were afterwards picked up at sea in an exhausted condition.

Many of the factories and ironworks were only partially working, whilst others were entirely closed ; a result brought about chiefly by the workmen themselves having made such exorbitant demands, and the natural results following \u2014 strikes and lock-outs, and then general distress."], [405, "IUDEX A Bill Quay, accident at, 23 A man ground to death in a mill, 87 Abbot Memorial Schools, laying foun- dation stone of. at Gateshead, 2 Abbott, Mrs., 2. 3 Biographical Notices \u2014 Charles Smith 1; Joseph Straker, 1; Rev.W.
