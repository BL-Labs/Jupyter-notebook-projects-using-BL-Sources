The roar of the lond-monthed thunder seemed as if it were splitting to fragments the vault of heaven, and as it died away in prolonged echoes it appeared seeking for some crevice in the solid earth throngh which the continents and oceans conld be ripped up and dashed together in chaotio confusion.

Sighs, groans, whispers, exclamations, appeared! to fill the air. It was as if the dead in that old fane had risen, and were holding saddened council npon the war of the elements without. Then, for a few moments, the reason of the pale, trembling man, who crouched down to the cold stone floor ef one of the ancient chapels seemed as though it were giving way. forced into the streets hastened to ths shelter of doorways, of dark arches, of courts, anywhere that they conld shelter their eyes from the blind ing lightning, and modify, in some degree, that fearful rattle of tbe thunder. Then, as the last stroke of twelve o'clock sounded from many a steeple, there came down such a torrent of rain that the \" floodgates of the deep\" seemed to be opened and a second deluge at hand. He uttered shriek upon shriek. \" Mercy, mercy I Oh, 6pare me ! Let me have some faint shadow of that mercy which is said to be infinite !\" Perpendicularly down from a mass of clouds of extraordinary blackness came the thick, dense shower. There came then one wild dash of rain, and the tropical like shower was over. Like arrows, like long lances of water, making a thick foamy mist upon the house-tops, drenching to the skin in the space of half a dozen seconds every living being who was exposed to its fury, came that unexampled rain. It was truly a night of terror. A night of terror for the pure of soul, for the gentle, the fair, and the good, whose hearts knew no stain. The pale, livid man shrieked again. \" Mercy I Oh, heaven, spare me ! \u2014 spare me !\" He fell upon his face. His forehead struck with a dull, heavy sound upon the stone flooring of the chapel. A thin stream of blood came from the wound thus inflicted ; and then the senses of the man reeled in wild confusion, and, as he tried to press aside the tangled masses of his long, black, snaky-looking bair from his brow, be spoke from the wild delirium of the half-maddened brain. A night of terror to the babe at the mother's breast, to the mother who clasped the Uttle one to tor throbbing heart. A night of terror to those who bad dear friends and relatives who had \" Gone down to the sea in ships.\" But, oh I what a night of terror to those who might dread the justice of heaven, and who, in every glare of the forked lightning, beheld the \" heavens open Uke a gate,\" and who, in the fear ful tones of the thunder, heard tbe proclamation of a power they had outraged. In the poorest hovels \u2014 in the etateUest palaces \u2014 in the inmost sanctuaries of tbe most solemn temples, no rest was found on that night of tempest \" All lost ! \u2014 all lost I A life of crime, and no thing bnt despair I Oh, heaven I what might I not have been \u2014 and what am I now ? Why do I not die ? No, no, no ! \u2014 oh, no ! I did not call on death ! \u2014 I do not call npon death !

Upon the old Abbey at Westminster the rain fell like pellets of steel, and the rush, and roar, aud tumult was so great \u2014 echoing from nave to cloister, from cloister to chapel \u2014 that th* shriek of dismay which suddenly mingled with the sounds of the tempest might well be expected to issue from the lips of any human being who, by any possibility, might be at such an hour within the saored pile. There was a human, living soul within the walls of the old Abbey. Bnt one only. In one of the small chapels \u2014 one of those dim, mysterious homes of the dead which strike an awe upon the senses, and the very atmosphere of which seems to be laden with the sighs and regrets of a past age \u2014 .there stood \u2014 there crawled rather \u2014 there shrunk and trembled, one living being. Pale even to ghastly lividity, this man listened, as he shook in every limb, to the wild storm with out. Lord Warringdale\u2014 yes, this is no other than Lord Warringdale I He who might have been happy had he so willed it I He who might bave ever stood by the side of Felix Heron \u2014 now Earl of Whiteombe \u2014 as a dear brother. Lord Warring dale struggled to his feet ; and, holding both hia hands above his head, he seemed on the point of adding tbe sin of some fearful malediction to _______ soul, when he was startled by a sudden crash of glass. Tha unmistakable sound of breaking glass. The cessation of the down-pour of rain had been the cessation of the storm. A roaring wind had swept over London for the space of about ten minutes, and then a broad chasm had opened in the mnrky clouds. The moon looked calmly with its silver face npon the troubled earth. The tempest was over. And so, in the stillness that surrounded it \u2014 a stillness that after such raging sonnds seemed re markable \u2014 Lord Warringdale heard a sound as of the breaking of glass. He let his hands drop slowly to his sides, and listened. He seemed to be seeking, with gestures of agonized desire, for some place in which he codd hide his head from what appeared to be the end of all things \u2014 \" the crack of doom.\" Throngh the vast expanse of the old Abbey the raging tempest echoed fearfully: It was as if this man had been enclosed in a canliron of copper while a hundred workmen riveted upon it hoops of iron. Upon the stone pavement of a portion of the old Abbey floor he heard fragments of glass falling. He held his breath to listen. He whispered to his own heart and brain in balf-ohoked accents. \" What is it? Who is it I Do they come to take me ? Have they tracked me here ? Am I lost now ? Taken, tried, condemned, hooted, and hanged I\" He plunged his right hand into his breast, and tjrew forth partially the handle of a poniard th>t . \u00ab had there concealed. And the disturbed air of tt e ancient edifice, as it rushed from chapel to cloister, and in beating masses around the shafts of the old columns, seemed instinct with a thousand voices."], [9, "EDITH HERON. 3 Then he heard a footstep. The chapel in which Lord Warringdale was, the reader of these memorials has already heard some thing of. In a certain letter which Jonathan Wild had written to Lord Warringdale, he had mentioned that chapel as one in which there was a tomb sup ported by sculptured figures. That was the chapel in which, acting upon that advice, Warringdale had sought refuge from the arm of the law, whioh had been outstretched to clutch him. No \u2014 he wonld not be able to oome. The promise to do so was but an idle boast in his letter, which the oommon sense of Lord Warringdale prompted him to disregard. But here he was ! For once \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the voice of the villain Wild was a welcime sound. More welcome than would have been the veice of an aBgel to Lord Warringdale. An angel must have been an accuser- Jonathan Wild was a confederate. \"Warringdale! \u2014 Warringdale I\" said Wild again. \" Here !\" It was at the narrow entrance to that abode of mystery and death, that he now stood, to listen to what sounds might be in the Abbey. The hair, matted as it was with blood, moved with a creeping motion on the head of Lord War ringdale, as he heard some slow and heavy foot steps approaching. Dp the long cloister they came ; and as they did so, he heard, accompanying them, groans and moans, as of some one suffer mg much from bodily pain and difficulty in walking Warringdale drew back. A horrible idea took possession of him. Was not that a fitting place, and a fitting time, for the spirits of those whom he had murdered to visit him ? \" Confusion seize you !\" \" Me ? Me ? Why do yen speak to me in snch a tone ? Do I not suffer ? I am nearly mad !\" \" And I \u2014 quite \u2014 quite! I \u2014 ah! \u2014 have you any \u2014 any stimulant ? For the first time in my life, I fear to \u2014 to faint 1\" Jonathan sunk to the flocr of the chapel, and only saved himself from utter prostration by clasping his left arm around one of the kneeling statues. He rested his head against the cold face of the statue, and groaned. It felt like a consolation to Lord Warringdale to find that Wild was in so dilapidated a state. \" What is the matter ? What has happened to you?\" \" Everything.\" \" But\u2014 but \" What if it were permitted that the dead Earl of Bridgewater, whom he had so foully murdered in Paddock Hill Lane, should visit him, there and then, at that still hour of the night ? What if, following him, should come that awful corpse from the window-seat in the chambers in St James's Street \u2014 the mangled body of the boast ful man who had acted as his second in the duel in Kensington Gardens-? \"Say at once!\" cried Wild, summoning up all his energies for a momentary burst of passion. \" Say at once ! Am I to die here, or have you been sensible enough to \u2014 to \u2014 bring some \u2014 some restorative?\" There were others, too ! Lord Warringdale had not to dive deep into the recesses of his memory to find other deeds of blood. A terrible enumeration of the ghastly visitors he might have, came across his recollection. S ill the footsteps advanced. They paused near the chapel. Hardly able to stand \u2014 hardly able to crawl, Lord Warringdale. made his way, step by step, backwards, to the blue, slaty-looking slab in the wall, which he had been told by Jonathan Wild was moveable, and wouli open a passage for him to the vaults The voice of Wild grew fainter. Lord Warringdale had brought from his lodgings a flask of eau de vie. For a moment he hesitated whether he should deal Jonathan a blow on the top of tbe head with it, or apply its mouth to his lips. How often had he, Warringdale, sought for some good opportunity of ridding himself of Jonathan Wild ! And now the opportunity had come ; for, whatever was the reason, it was quite evident that Wild, from hurts or from fatigue, was quite helpless. But what hope had he, Warringdale, of the only thing he would like now to live for apart from Wild? He bad hitherto\u2014 since he had fled from his own lodgings, and found a refuge in the Abbey \u2014 remained hiding in the chapel. Twice he had assured himself that the blue, slaty stone was moveable, but he had not had the courage to pass through the narrow aperture it presented to him. He thought he would do so now. His hand was on the corner of the stone, when he heard his own name pronounced. \" Warringdale ! \u2014 Warringdale !\" The voice in which he was called was thick and faint. Vengeance ! That was what he panted for. Vengeance against his brother, the Earl of Whitcombe. Vengeance against the f jr Countess Edith. Wild mijht help hin to that. Therefore Lord Warrii igdale placed the mouth of the eau de vie flask tc the lips of the fainting ruffian, instead of finish mg him by a blow with the thickest end of it. \"Ah! Ah!\" \"Ton are better, Will?\" \" A thousand times.\" \" What an awful stc-Ym there has been !\" But Lord Warringdale knew it. The cadences of that voice had sounded in his \" Stuff! What do 1 __re for storms? Give me that bottle again.\" ears too often to be mistaken for any other, in any place and at any time. It was the voice of Jonathan Wild. \" Are yon wounded ?\" \" No. Yes. I am a mass of bruises \u2014 of crushed bones and mangled muscles. I ought net to b. alive\u2014 but here I am, for all that, with a reward of five hundred pounds for me\u2014 ha ! ha! They don't know Jonathan Wild yet I am worth more than tbat ; more\u2014 more thau that Where is that bottle?\" To be sure, Jonathan had said that he wonld oome there, but Lord Warringdale had not expected Siini. How was Wild to get out of Newgate ? How was: he to elude the vigilance of those who would feel that their reputation was involved in tiie due care of snch a malefactor ?"], [10, "4 EDITH HERON. The new Earl, looking so noble, and so serene. and so happy, that the sight of his handsome countenanoe was entrancing, was close to tbe old Lady Castleneau, who had been so dear a friend to him in all his troubles. The young Earl of Bridgewater and his friend, Colonel Trelawney, too, were present And with a smile upon his face, shaded as it was with his white hair, there appeared the noble and the gifted Sir Dominick Browne. The party was a small one, for it was felt by Lady Castleneau that there should be no faces around her npon that occasion, with the glow of hope and pleasure npon them, which had not sym pathised with the distresses of Edith and of Cap tain Heron. \" You have it\" \" Ab, so I have I Ah, that's good ! Well, well, my Lord Warringdale \u2014 a pretty affair, it seems you have made of all this I\" \" I ? \u2014 I, say you ?\" \"Who else?\" \" You, Jonathan\u2014 you. Who but you had the conduct of everything?\" \" No ! You are well aware that if I had had the conduct of everything, all would have been well ; but you were ever try ing to do without me, and that did all the mischief.\" Lord Warringdale groaned. \" It's of no use,\" he said, \" to speak of the past\" \" Not a bit.\" \" The present should engage all our attention.\" \" And the future.\" Moreover, Lady Castleneau had a revelation to make \u2014 a revelation which had been entrusted to her, and wbioh would have the e fleet of clearing np to the mind of Felix Heron much that was wild and wonderful in the events which had re cently occurred. *' Yes, oh, yes ! you said you would come here, Jonathan ; but I must own I did not expect you. How could you get out of Newgate ?\" \" Pho ! I was dangerous.\" \" Dangerous ?\" \" Yes. Dangerous to those who had the power to keep me in Newgate or to let me go, so they pretended to let me go, but laid an ambush for me. I know now tbat the design was to pretend to let me escape, and then pounce upon me and kill me in the process. It has failed. I am alive, but I have had a fall\" The first faint mutterings of that tremendous tempest which we have already described as pass ing over London on that evening, were beginning slightly to be felt from afar, as Edith turned to Lady Castleneau, speaking with happy cadences in her joyous voice, and her eyes sparkling with a contentment that had been long a stranger to her heart \" A fall ?\" \" It is yon, dear aunt,\" she said, \" who will have the power of persuasion, which perhaps no one here can exert but yourself, over Felix. It is you who will make him yield to my request that until to-morrow he will leave a projected journey to Epping, and let this evening be one of congratula tion and unalloyed felicity.\" Lady Castlenean was about to speak, when the new Earl of Whitcombe stepped forward, and, holding her hands in both his own, interrupted her. \" You will permit me likewise to call you dear aunt,\" he said, \" and to ask yon a question which I am certain can have but one answer from yonr lips.\" \" Nay !\" cried Edith ; \" he will persuade you past your senses. Do not listen to him.\" \" Can there be perfect felicity,\" added the Earl, \" if there be a duty unfulfilled?\" Lady Castlenean looked from one to the other, and a smile was upon her lips, for she was too happy to feel anything but contentment and satis faction with whatever those persons so dear to her chose to say. \" Let me speak,\" added Edith, \" and I will tell you what it is, dear aunt, on this night of all others, Felix purposes doing.\" \"it is a duty,\" said the Earl \u2014 \"a paramount duty.\" \" Nay, let others decide. He wishes to ride t> Epping Forest, taking a large sum of money with him for division among his old comrades ; and to consult with them what is best to be done for their immediate safety and future subiistence.\" * And is that not enough ?\" said Felix, with a smile. \" Yes, from the top of Newgate!\" \u00ab No 1\" \" It is true. I don't know how or why I was not smashed, bnt I shall want rest. 1 cannot think even now. What sort of a place is the vault on tbe other side of that stone?\" \" I don't know.\" \" You don't know ?\" \" No, Jonathan, I bave not had the courage, I own, to penetrate into it.\" \"Then I must Ah!\" Wild, on the impulse of the moment, and sadly hurt as he was, sprung upon his feet Lord Warringdale uttered a very imprudent cry of terror. The slash of lights in the nave of the Abbey had come across their eyes, and they heard a voice cry ont aloud, \" It is certain that the villain is here, and that he made his way through the east window.\" CHAPTER II. THE MYSTERY i IF WHITCOMBE HOUSE. The great old dn wing-room at Castlenean House is lighted up. For the first time, os Lady Castleneau informs Edith, the chandeliers are lit these thiity years. There is a joyous and happy party there as sembled on that tame evening of the terrible storm, which had struck such dismay into the guilty heart of the villain Warringdale in tbe old attic. Lady Castlenean had insisted that the first happy evening spent together by all those persons, who had suffered so much in the cause of truth and justice, should be beneath ber roof. \" It is a duty,\" said Lady Castlenean. \" And yet one that after all, might keep a little,\" remarked the Earl of Bridgewater, who had over heard the little dialogue. \" Always remember, Whitcombe, that it is quite impossible any of yonr band in Epping Forest could be prosecuted on account of affairs for which you yourself had re ceived a free pardon.\" \" On lhat score 1 feel easy enough ; and, indeed It wasa debt of gratitude they all owed to her to comply with that with. There was a look of serene joy upon the face of the old gentlewoman, as she glanced from one to the other of her guests on that happy occasion. Edith, the Countess of Whitcombe, was present"], [11, "5 EDITH HJ ISON. the only person I fancy who would wish to insti tute such prosecution will be disposed of in course of law. Jonathan Wild is in Newgate.\" \"And therefore,\" added the Earl of Bridge water, \" let to-morrow suffice for this expedition.\" \" Oh, yes 1 \u2014 to-morrow !\" cried Edith, joyously ; \" and hark ! what is that ?\" Forest, but a peer of the realm, with the royaf pardon for all past misdeeds in my pocket \u2014 with the estates and revenues, the limits of which it will take me some time to comprehend ; \u2014 and with your dear love, Edith, as the crowning joy of all ! And yet there are tears gathering in the eyes of our dearest friend here, as she tells us we hover upon the brink of some discovery \u2014 some mystery \u2014 which will stir our inmost souls.\" \" Thunder I\" said Heron, as he walked to one of of the windows, across which, at the moment, there streamed the first vivid flash of lightning which was the forerunner of the storm. Edith crept closer to the side of Felix Heron, and then Lady Castleneau strove to chase away the look of sadness and emotion which was upon her face, as she said, \" No, no ! it may all end in happiness \u2014 in yet further happiness I I will trust and hope it may do eo. It is a mystery of crime and of guilt, but it is likewise a mystery of re pentance and of reparation. I will say no more. But come with me, dear children \u2014 for such you are to me \u2014 and you shall know all. That know ledge may remove rather than cast a shadow upon the sunshine of your path.\" The door of the saloon was flung open as Lady Castleneau walked towards it \u2014 as it was evident her servants had been informed of her intention to go forth on that night, for old Anthony was close at haud. \" There I\" oried Edith, as she clapped her hands ; \" the very elements are against you.\" \"I yield,\" said Heron. \"I will not ride forth to-night.\" \" Indeed, and in truth,\" said Lady Castleneau, \" I was about to say you must not\" \" But Ogle and Tom Ripon are in the court yard \u2014 both of them mounted, and ready for this expedition. Daisy, too, is with them, with whom, by this time, I fully expected to be on the route to the old forest\" \" No,\" said Lady Castleneau, \" pardon me, my dear nephew. I have seen to all that; and the horses, with their riders, are carefully bestowed in the eld stables of this house. My carriage, how ever, waits in the court-yard, and in tbat we have in truth somewhere to go, where there will be a duty to perform, as high and as noble as any that can attach you to your faithful band in the forest\" \" You, aunt ?\" exclaimed Edith. \" Do yeu in tend to go iorth to-night ?\" \" Yes, my dear Edith ; there is a mystery which this night must solve. It may be called the mys tery of Whitcombe House, for it is to tbat mansion, which now belongs to you and your Felix, that we must proceed.\" There was a tremulousness in tbe voice of Lady Castleneau, and an emotion in her manner, which much surprised Felix Heron. Certainly, if he had been asked concerning the mysteries of Whitcombe House, he would have replied that things had happened there he was in a situation by no means satisfactorily to explain. He would have said that there had appeared to be in that mansion a connexion and a communica tion between the visible and the invisible world which had transcended all his experiences ; and now, as he looked into the eyes of Lady Castle neau, he could with ease read the expression which beamed from them. With the privilege of an old domestic, he made a remark to his lady, which he hoped would alter her determination. \" It's such a stormy night, my lady,\" he said, \" that the chimney-pots in Bloomsbury will hardly see it through. There's been some thunder and lightning, too, such as my old eyes scarcely ever saw.\" Anthony's words were verified at the moment by a vivid flash of the electric fluid, followed by a succession of claps of thunder, as the sound was reflected from cloud to cloud, which almost had the effect of startling the steady old horses in Lady Oastleneau's carriage. The elderly gentlewoman paused for a moment, and then advancing resolutely, she said, \"The distance is short; and who shall say that to morrow's morn may see me in possession of life, health, and strength, to do this duty ?\" Felix Heron was thoroughly convinced that this expedition of Lady Oastleneau's to Whit combe House was on account cf some matter of great importance. What it could be bis imagi nation ran riot in endeavouring to surmise ; and then, by an effort, he dismissed all conjecture from his miad, since so short a time must present to him the real truth of the mystery. It was then between ten and eleven o'clock, and the storm which had raged with such fury at mid night had by no means as yet reached the cha racter which it attained when the terrified Lord Warringdale listened to it in all its terrors from within the old Abbey of Westminster. The old-fashioned coach of Lady Castlenean soon traversed the distance from Castleneau House to St James's Street, and the small party, consist ing of the new Earl and Countess of Whitcombe, the Earl of Bridgewater and his lady, Colonel Trelawney, and Lady Castleneau herself, stood in the hall of Whitcombe House. \" You, dear friend,\" he said, \" are acquainted with the solution of these mysteries, and it is one which moves your heart greatly.\" \"It is \u2014 it is, Felix ; it is !\" \" Then under your guidance I place myself, and whether for weal or woe, let the werld of conjec- ture whioh those mysteries have awakened in my heart be quelled for ever!\" Lady Castleneau rose with a look of intense in- terest and an emotion which was almost painful. She shook as she leant npon the arm of Edith. \" I know not,\" she said, \u2014 \" I cannot know if what has been done was wise or not I cannot know if what is to be dene this night will make you, Edith, or you, Felix, the happier ; but I have resisted burdening the small remains of my exist ence with a secret that presses heavily upon me.\" Even as Lady Castleneau spoke, the thunder muttered over Castleneau House, and then, with a faint smile, Felix Heron spoke. \" Who shall say,\" he cried, \" that there shall be happiness, or even serenity, for one passing hour ? Here am I, no longer Captain Felix Heron, the leader of a band of depredators in Epping An oil lamp burnt in a niche, and shed a faint ray over that magnificent hall, gently tinting the statuary with a twilight-looking colour, and glis tening here and there upon the gilding of the balustrades, which ran the height of the grand staircase. Lady Castleneau took the lead, and with more firmness now than could bave been expected from her she slowly commenced the ascent of that grand"], [12, "6 EDITH HERON. staircase, which the last time Captain Heron had ascended it had been on the occasion when he be came so mysteriously possessed cf those important documents, which at once put an end to all doabt and trouble in regard to h s legitimate claim to the earldom and estates of Whitcombe. Lady Castleneau moved with slow steps to a chair which stood on one side of the hearth, and Felix Heron, seeing that she seemed feeble, darted forward to help her. At that instant a strange noise sounded in the house. There had always been an air of sadness and of mystery about that house to Felix Heron. He could not cross its hall without recollecting that interview he had hid with his father, the late E-irl, on the occasion when be had first proclaimed himself his son, and when, overcome by the rush of emotions which a recollection of the past had produced, the Earl, in all the defiant pride and power of his prosperity, had succumbed to the Destroyer and passed away like a dream Edith, with her arms clasped in that of Felix, followed Lady Castlenean closely ; and the idea for a moment came across tbe mind of Heron that pro bably Elith already bad some indication of what was about to take place in that mysterious mansion. Such, however, was not the case, for, if she had felt iucliued to do so, Edith could scarcely have trusted herself to the good keepiDg of any secret which concerned closely the happiness or the feel ings of Felix Heron- They all started \" What, in the name of heaven I\" oried Heron, \" does all this mean ?\" \"I will tell all! I will tell aU!\" said Lady Castlenean. \" But first let me say that the secret is one tbat has not been for long in my keeping.\" \"What secret?\" \" I am afraid,\" said Colonel Trelawney, as he now stepped forward, \" that I am a stranger, and in the way, if any family revelations are about to take place.\" \" And I, too,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. Felix Heron looked from one to the other of those gentlemen doubtfully. It was Lady Castlenean, however, wh. put an end to those honourable scruples on the part of the Coloisel and the Earl. \" No, gentlemen, no,\" she said ; \" yon are not in the way, for nothing can be more desirable than tbat two gentlemen of honour like yourselves should be present at what I am about tolsay. and what is aViout to happ\u00bbn; since you will be able to bring a calm judgment to bear npon the circum stances.\" One gl ince at the ingenuous countenance of Edith dispelled the idea, and he did not pain her by sug gesting it. The E*rl of Bridgewater and Colonel Trelaw ney, with the Countess of Bridgewater, followed closely ; and in that order the p.rty reaohed that magnificent saloon in Whitcombe House, inwhi h, it will be remembered by the readers of the earlier portion of these chronicles, Captain Heron had held a colloqny with some mysterious being, who appeared thoroughly acquainted with his history and antecedents The Colonel and the Earl bowed. Then Lady Castleneau held one of the hands of Felix Heron in both her own, as she looked up throngh her tears into his face, and uttered the words, \" Yonr poor father !\" \"My father?\u2014 the late Earl? Oh, what of him?\" \"Felix, Felix\u2014 that father \u2014 he who has erred greatly \" \" No, no \u2014 say no more of him and his errors. He has passed away, and to the prayers of his son and the mercy of heaven let us leave the dead 1\" Lady Oastleneau's tears fell fast \" Felix, Felix,\" she said sobbingly, \" that father whom yon eo piously spoke of \u2014 that father for whom you pray \" \" Ob, forbear! \u2014 forbear! If the tale be one of guilt let me not hear it!\" The shutters of the 6even tall wiudows of this magnificent apartment were closed, aud the heavy silken curtains were drawn closely. Some half-dozan wax candles in the central chandelier, which carried forty, were alight ; and although they were sufficient to dispel actual dark nets from the saloon, it by no means could be eaid to be illuminated. And not a sound in the whole of tbat mansion op to this moment disturbed the intense stillness of non-occupation, which it presented. There was a slight feeliog of dread now in the breast of Felix Heron, and he knew not why it was that t .at feeling was greatly increased by the sight of some smouldering embers on the ample hearth of that apartment These were traces of occupation. But of whose occupation ? Whi; was it that found a bome, temporarily or permanently, in old Whitcomhe Honee ? Was it his bad, wicked half-brother, with whom he was to be confronted ? \" Felix, Felix ! That father lives /' CHAPTER III. INTRODUCES THE KEADRB TO A TRAOEDT Tp a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet \u2014 if the great world of hfaven had split asunder \u2014 and the bright intelligence of another and a better world had streamed down npon rainbows of light to the earth, Felix Heron conld not have been more as tounded than he waa at these words from old Lady Castleneau. No ! That supposition vanished with one glance at the look of tearful emotion on the face of Lady Castlenean. What could it be then that so fearfully affected the kind and gentle heart o' Lady Castleneau, and which bad induced her to seek ut such an hour of the night, a late one for her, the deserted mansion of the Earl of Whitcombe ? In thrilling accents she repeated she words, \" Felix .' Felix ! yonr father lives!\" \" Gracious heaven !\" Fe'ix Heron staggered under the surprise of this intelligence. He retreated until became to a large arm-chair, upon whi h be sink, and a faint feeling came over his heart The embers on the ample hearth had evidently ' been lighted long, for there was not only in the I atmosphere of the saloon the odour of burning I wood, but there was likswise a soft and genial warmth, which betokened the fact of the apartment having been closed for many hourd and exposed to the influence of the artificial warmth.

Speak to me! \u2014 oh, speak to me !\" \" Thank heaven !\" He drew a long breath."], [13, "EDITH HERON. 7 \" I see it all \u2014 I see it all, now 1 All clear and plain as in a glass.\" \" No, no !\" said Lady Castleneau ; \" it is for me to tell you all. It is my task to tell you all \u2014 it is my duty to detail to you all the strange events \u2014 and yet they are few in number \u2014 which have made the great world believe the Earl of Whitcombe dead, when in reality he still breathed the breath of life.\" \"Alas! alas!\" moaned Felix. \" Once before that occasion, when in a state of great excitement the Earl had fallen into a trance which had looked like death, and on that occasion he fell into such another, but the last one was be lieved to be death itself.\" \"Oh, how terrible 1\" \" And with a haste dictated by the cupidity o. one who hoped to step into the title and estates of Whitcombe with speed and ease, the supposed remains of the Earl were carried to the family mausoleum, at Severndroorg Castle, on Shootei's Hill.\" A soft glow came over the face of Felix Heron. There was the light of a new joy in his eyes, and he stretched ont his arms as though he would fain hold to his heart that father who he was told still lived. \" Entombed alive \u2014 entombed, while yet the heart and brain lived in sympathy ?\" \" Even so ; but after the first trance whioh the Earl had fallen into, and which had lasted two days \u2014 that was some four years since \u2014 he had added a codicil or memorandum to his will, to the effect that he was to be placed in the family vault in an open coffin \u2014 a coffin only covered by a velvet pall, bnt no lid.\" Heron shuddered. \" Joy I joy I\" he cried. \" Father, father, speak to me \u2014 appear to me ! Now, indeed, I know by what means I became possessed, in this mansion, of those documents whioh cleared away all the mists and all the obscurities from my fate, and made me seemingly the Earl of Whitcombe. Oh ! how gladly do I renounce that title and all that belongs to it, for the joy of resting on a father's heart, to whom I may give the affection of a son. Father ! father ! if you indeed live, speak to me !\" No one then present could suppose for a moment that snch an appeal as this could be resisted. Even Lady Castleneau grasped the arms of the chair in which she sat, and half rose as she bent her gaze towards a portion of the wall of the saloon, where hung the portrait of a yonng and beautiful woman. Edith looked np; every trace of colour had departed from her lips. Colonel Trelawney and the young Earl of Bridgewater paid the most fixed attention to the singular recital. \" There had always been,\" added Lady Castle neau, \" a clause in the body of the will of the Earl, that when death really came to him. he should be consigned to the tomb in his peer's robes, and with the jewelled insignia of his rack as a Knight of the Garter about him. That was pride \u2014 that was the vanity of earthly honour, and earthly ambition ; but it was the mode in whioh heaven marked out its own purposes !\" But all was still ; the appeal was in vain. \" Not yet,\" said Lady Castlenean, with a deep sigh,\u2014 \"not yet\" \" When, when \u2014 oh, when,\" added Felix Heron, in excited tones, \u2014 \" when are these eyes to look npon the face of my father ?\" \" It is meant,\" added Lady Castleneau, speaking in tones of great emotion, \u2014 \" it is meant that you should know all first, Felix. A few\u2014 a very few words will tell you.\" \" Speak, then \u2014 oh, speak then ! My own dear Edith, keep close to my heart, and we will listen to this revelation together.\" There was a slush upon the face of Edith, and after one glance at the Earl of Bridgewater and Colonel Trelawney, as though for half a second her impulses of affection were controlled and re strained by their presence, she cast her arms around the neck of her hnsband, and rested her head upon his breast Then both those gentlemen bowed respectfully, as though they would have said, \" We respect and honour the spontaneous exhibition of a pure love, without stain and without reproach.\" It was a beautiful and affecting picture, that of the yonng wife on the breast of him whom she so truly loved, while the tears fell fast from the eyes of Lady Castleneau. Then, in a low, soft tone, the noble-hearted gentlewoman spoke. \" My dear, dear, children, I can tell you all, be cause it was from the lips of the Earl of Whit combe himself I heard the story. He has for a time found peace and refuge in Castleneau House.\" Edtth looked up rapidly into the eyes of Felix Heron, and they both at the moment fully remem bered the mysterious figure they had seen at Castlenean House. \"When,\" added the old lady,\u2014 \"when you, Felix, had that interview with your father, in his own private cabinet in this house, on the occasion that you told him that you was his son, and im plored from him the affection of a father, he was of the world, worldly, and he repelled yon from him.\" \" Oh, dear, dear, Felix!\" sobbed Edith. \"You will be happier now !\" \" I am \u2014 I am happy !\" Lady Castleneau continued, although her voice was occasionally ohoked by sobs. \" On the evening of the day on whioh the sup posed body of the Earl was carried to the vault at Severndroorg Castle, a servant of this house \u2014 one who had received great kindness at the hands of the Earl \u2014 was tempted to proceed to the vault for the purpose of robbing the dead body of the jewelled insignia of the Order of the Garter, and the ermined robes of a peer, in which, according to the desire of the Earl, he was attired. That sacrilegious hand removed the velvet pall from the open coffin ; and the trance, into whioh the Earl had fallen, was either over instantly, or some rush of cold air conduced to his restoration ; but the supposed dead Earl opened his eyes and sighsd.\" \" My father ! \u2014 my poor father !\" exolaimed Heron. \" The guilty man fled in dismay. His reason did not withstand the shock of the supposed re buke he had received from the dead. He is now a wandering maniac\" \" And the Earl, my father ?\" \" He rose np, and, attired in his peer's robes, be walked to a cottage, where he procured some bread and milk, and then he took his way to London.\" \" Here ? To this house ?\" \" Yes.

There are no hearts here but warm, kindly towards you \u2014 no bands but will clasp yours with delight! Father! father ! come forth and let those who love you look upon your face !\" There was no response to this most urgent and passionate appeal. The silence in the house was something awful and dismal. \" Father\u2014 father !\" \" I cannot bear this suspense,\" added Heron. \" Gentlemen, assist me. Who shall say that a third death-like trance, on the excitement of this occasion, joyful though it ought to be, has not come over my poor father? Assist me, gentle men, to search this house, and let us put our trust in heaven!\" \"I have told all!\" sobbed Lady Castleneau. \" You know now, Felix, the mystery of old Whit combe House !\" \"I do \u2014 I do; and gladly! \u2014 oh, how gladly! \u2014 for the dearer title of son, do I renounce the Earl dom of Whitcombe, and give back to my father all its honours and all its possessions!\" \" Not so,\" added Lady Castleneau. \" I bave now to tell you what your father has resolved to do, Felix.\" \" To live in honour \u2014 beloved and respected?\" \" Yes. But not as the Earl of Whitcombe. He wishes this most strange rescue of his from the tomb to bo kept a secret in the breasts of those who are here present, and who hear the story. Here are two gentlemen of honour and rank, who will, if there should ever arise the occasion, be witnesses to the fact that he abdicated, so to term it, all his titles and estates in your favour, Felix.\" Lady Castleneau then rose again. \" I will show you, Felix \u2014 I will show you one of the secrets of Whitcombe House. It is through this secret door in the wall that your father spoke to you. It is by this route he was to have joined us here.\" Lady Castleneau pressed upon a particular part of the heavy gilt frame of the portrait of the fair female on the wall, and it turned aside, canying with it frame, portrait, and panel, exhibiting be hind it a narrow passage constructed in the thick ness of the wall, \" This house,\" said Lady Castleneau, \" was the secret abode of many a loyal gentleman dining tbe troubles of the Commonwealth in England ; and it is full of secret chambers and concealed passages, like my own home at Castleneau House.\" \" Then,\" said Felix Heron, speaking in a high tone of overwrought feeling, \"follow me, dear sirs, in search of a father !\" \" No \u2014 no.\" \" I was sure you would say no.\" \" It cannot be.\" \" Never, Felix I\" said Edith. \" Happier, much happier, shall your father be in his vast posses sions, while we, as a loving son and daughter, will wait with affection on his declining years.\" Lady Castleneau now rose from the chair on which she had been reclining, and rising her voice as high as she could, she said, \" It is time ! \u2014 it is time !\" CHAPTER IV. Edith and Felix Heron both sprang to their feet. It was evident to them that these words, by the manner in which Lady Castleneau uttered them, must have been arranged between ber and the Earl of Whitcombe as those upon the sound of which he was to make his appearance. EDITH HAS THE CUP OF JOY DASHED FROM HER LIPS. While Lady Castleneau had been making these extraordinary revelations, the 6torm which raged wildly over London had gathered strength and fury. \" It is time ! \u2014 it is time !\" said Lady Castleneau n gain. But it was not until near the hour of midnight that that convulsion of the elements merited the term of tempest, although at the moment that Felix Heron, accompanied by Colonel Trelawney and the Earl of Bridgewater, stood at the narrow, secret doorway in the saloon at Whitcombe House, the thunder was pealing overhead in rather a ter rific fashion. As she spoke she bent her gaze, as she had frequently done during her narrative, upon the portrait on the wall of the saloon of the fair young female form, as though it had some connexion with the mode in which the Earl was to make an entrance to the saloon. Expectation became absolutely painful. Lady Castleneau could scarcely command her voice to speak a third time. \" It is time ! \u2014 it is time !\" Closely shut in as was that old mansion, and built massively, the storm which raged without was certainly, as regards the tumult and uproar, very much modified before it could reach the ears of those iu the saloon. All was still as the grave. The heart of Felix Heron beat so rapidly and so painfully that he was constrained to press both his hands upon his breast to endeavour to restrain it But still there was quite sufficient of the elemental strife to mingle strangely with those intensified feelings of tbe heart which had been awakened by the extraordinary tale told by Lady Castleneau. \" Tell me \u2014 tell me, Lady Castleneau \u2014 tell me, my dear friend, should my dear father come forth to us upon your utterance of those words?\" \" He should !\u2014 he should!\" Felix Heron might well shake to his inmost soul as he looked from the dimly lighted saloon into the dark, narrow passage behind tbe portrait, fur what might he not expect to see upon pene trating into the secret passages of Whitcombe \"But he comes not!\" Lady Castleneau sunk back again into the chair. Felix Heron raised his voice, and called out"], [15, "EDITH HERON. 9 House after the wonders that had been narrated to him, and the non-appearance of his father at the signal words of Lady Castleneau ? It was the Earl o! Bridgewater who saw the necessity of light if they would pursue their re searches with any success through Whitcombe House. Lightly and actively the young nobleman leaped on to a table which stood beneath the great chan delier, and lifting one of the movable sconces from it containing a wax-light, he rejoined Felix Heron and Colonel Trelawney, saying as he did so, \"Permit me, dear friends, to lead the way, and I will be the torch-bearer.\" \" No,\" said Heron, as he drew the long glitter ing dress sword he wore, \u2014 \"no, Bridgewater, I am indebted to your kindness more than words can express. You have been a true and constant friend to me \u2014 when to befriend me was almost to cast a slur upon yourillustrious name. There may be danger in this house, for it is full of mysteries, and some time since strange noises fell upon my ears. Let me lead the way. It will be kind and friendly for you both to follow.\" There was an excitement about the manner and the tone of Felix Heron which scarcely ad mitted of any contention with him on the point, and the Earl of Bridgewater gave way to him at once ; contenting himself with holding the wax-light as high as possible above his head to light the dark narrow passage into which they entered. Where this passage would lead him, Felix Heron had not tbe remotest idea ; and it was with a feeling of both surprise and disappointment that he found it abruptly terminate after he had traversed it some forty paces. The young Earl of Bridgewater held up the wax-light, and as he had been more observant than Felix Heron of the walls of the narrow space in which they were, he was enabled at once to proclaim the fact that there was an outlet to the passage immediately to the left hand of Heron as he faced its abrupt termination. Tha necessity for concealment of the means used to remove some panel or fixture from its place only existed on the outside of ther narrow passage: on its inner surface, where these three persons were, those means were clear and ap parent.

A long spring-like piece of steel had but to be slightly raised at one end\u2014 corresponding in that manner with any pressure from without \u2014 and the panel immediately turned upon its hinges. The discovery they made now, seemed to be barren enough ; for upon crossing the threshold of the narrow opening, they found themselves close to the head of the grand staircase of Whit combe House. The Earl of Bridgewater followed with the light, and both he and Colonel Trelawney Were soon by the side of Heron, who was kneeling in that marble hall, by the side of a human form attired in the robes of a peer, and bedecked with the jewelled insignia of many an order of knight hood. \" This, then,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" is. after all, but a secret means of entering and leaving the great saloon.\" There was a look of great excitement in the eyes of Felix Heron as he now iai-ed his voice at the head of that grand staircase, and called aloud, \" Father, father ! if you be in life, speak to me ! If these walls contain yon, let your ears open to the voice of your son. Come forth. 0 veritable Earl of Whitcombe, and claim again those honours and dignities which belong to you, with the lustre of affection shining over all !\" Tbe high, excited voice of Felix Heron echoed through the dismal bouse \u2014 dismal in its grandeur and magnificence \u2014 dismal with all its gilding \u2014 all its rich adernments and all its palatial state ; for it was the abode of mystery \u2014 perhaps of murder. No voice responded to the passionate call of Telix Heron, and when ihe tones of his voice ceased, the silence tbat crept over the atmosphere of the house seemed more profound and melancholy than before. The scarlet and ermine robe contrasted strangely with the death-like face. Diamonds glittered in mockery of the lustreless eyes. Felix Heron uttered a cry of anguish, as be half-raised the body in his arras, and recognised by the faint light that fell upon his face, the fea tures of his father. \"This is death, at last!\" he said. \"This is death, at last ! 0 mockery of hope, is it thus that I am to behold him for whose preservation I would have given one- half my own existence ? This is a third trance, and it is one which not only looks like death, but is death itself. Behold, gentlemen ! can life ever again revisit these sight less orbs ? Will these pale lips ever m_ve again ? This is a barren conquest death has presented to me. I am now, indeed, truly the Earl of Whit combe ; but gladly would I have remained a wan derer in the forest glades of Epping, could life y\u00ab* have lingered in this inanimate frame \" \" It is murder!\" said tbe Earl of Bridgewater, in a voice that seemed to send the word echoing up the grand staircase to the topmost chambers of the house. \" Yes,\" added Colonel Trelawnnv, \" there has been some foul murder here ! This is no trance of death, or seeming death !\" Then Felix Heron spoke again, but there was grief mingled with his tones. \" Gentlemen,\" he said, \u2022' we shall be spectators of some catastrophe, the character of which, at present we may not judge of ; but sustained by your friendship, while I feel it like a man, I will bear it like one.\" \" Mulder ?\" exclaimed Heron. \" Yes. Do you not see that there is blood upon the ermined robe ?\" Heron was npon the point of descending the grand staircase to commence his 6earch of Whit combe House in a more systematic fashion, when Colonel Trelawney held his arm and gently drew hi.n back. \" And here is a sword,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater. \" Here is a sword, with blood npon its blade.\" The Earl picked up, as he spoke, from the tesse lated pavement of the hall, a sword of exquisite workmanship and singular costliness. The hilt was completely encrusted with diamonds, and the beauty of tbat hilt shone in terrible contrast with the ghastly stains upon the blade. \" My father's sword \u2014 surely my father's sword!\" exclaimed Heron. \" He is in full dress, gentle men, you see, as a peer of the realm, aud might wear such a sword as this Some kind and gentle impulses and designs, arising ont of his awakened better nature, no doubt induced him to attire himself as we now see bim, in accordance with the statement made by Lady Castleneau. Who shall say that be did not intend to transfer from himself to me these ermined robes and these glistening jewels? Alas! I see Oo wound. He may have been assailed, and wife this sword, per chance, has beaten off the would-be murderer.\" \" Let me advise,\" he said. \" You return to the saloon, and allow my Lord Bri-gowa'er and my self to conduct this search.\" There was a strange tone about the Colonel's words, and Heron happened at the moment to see that he gave the Earl of Bridgewater a significant glance, which had to him \u2014 Heron\u2014 an unknown meaning in it \" Fear me not \u2014 fear me not !\" he said. \" It is suspense which excites, and, to some extent, un mans me. When I know the worst you shall see that I can be calm, cool, and resolute.\" Colonel Trelawney, before he had last spoken to Felix Heron, had descended a few steps of the staircase ; and now that Heron spoke as he did, the Colonel pointed downwards to the hall. \" Behold, then,\" he said, \" if I mistake not, the object of our search !\" Lying upon the tesselated pavement was a dark object \u2014 and yet not altogether dark. There was a glistening brightness about eome portions of it ; and as the Earl of Bridgewater held the wax-light in snch a position that as many of its rays as possible descended into the hall, this object below assumed the outlines of a human ferm, partially attired in what seemed to be scarlet robes, scattered about it in wild confusion. \" Not so,\" said Colonel Trelawney ; \" yoar eyes are dimmed with tears. Behold ! The Earl .iet wears his own sword, which seems not to have been drawn from its sheath. This one which Bridgewater has picked up, has belonged to the assassin, and it has found a bome in the heart of this unhappy peer.\" Felix Heron sprung to his feet \" It is murder, then 1\" he shouted ; \" and I call alond for help. Help, help!\u2014 murder ! The Earl of Whitcombe is slain ' I call on all the world to hunt the assas-in ; and were he ten times mv brother \" ' Felix Heron cast but one bewildered glance npon that object below ; and then, with an excess of emotion that almost choked his utterance, he cried, \" My father ! It is my father !\" Swift as though endowed with wings, he It was evident from this strong expression"], [17, "11 aaa kes which way the suspicions of Felix Heron turned and the voice of heaven rolls over the foaming in regard to the murder of the Earl of Whit- I waters. Help ! oh, help and save me ! They are combe. upon my track, and would bear me back to chains, to stripes, to misery I Save me ! oh, save me ! and heaven will reward you ! I am footsore and weary. They say that I am mad : it may be that I am! Oh, heaven! are the lightnings of this fearful storm in search of the wicked hearts tbat oppress thy creatures ? Help ! help ! In meroy, do not cast me forth ! They will not kill me \u2014 that would be meroy \u2014 but they will drive me forth again, to years of agony, amid the shrieks and cries of those whom Providence has blighted ! I am not mad ! \u2014 I am not mad!\" But for once in a way he did an injustice to Warringdalo, his half-brother. It was not his hand who had slain the Earl in the hall of his own mansion, with that sword the hilt of which was encrusted with diamonds. The hour of midnight struck as Felix Heron called aloud for justice and for vengeance. The storm was at its height, and that terrible down pour of rain which had so startled the guilty Lord Warringdale, as he crouched in fear amid the gloom and mystery of Westminster Abbey, began to fall. The vehemence, the rapidity, the wild agonized tones in which these words were uttered, invested them with a terrible fascination. It was not, then, the hand of the parricide which struck the Earl of Whitcombe A deeper mystery was involved in the secret of his death \u2014 a mystery which these pages will dis cover \u2014 a mystery which is to be a pain and an anguish to Edith, and which is to produce the one small cloud which threatens to darken the heaven of her felicity. The voice of the Earl of Bridgewater had pene trated to the saloon. That one word \"murder,\" which he had uttered with such appalling distinct ness, had reached the ears and gentle hearts of those there waiting the result of the search in Whitcombe House. Felix Heron felt as though he were constrained to listen to them, without the remotest power of uttering a word to stem the torrent of beseeching expiessions. The wretched object crouched at his feet She wrung her hands, she wept she screamed ; and then, before he could stoop to raise her, or utter a word of consolation or of comfort, there came that last terrible peal of thunder which was the termi nation of the tempest. It seemed as if the poor bewildered creature, who had no doubt been exposed ihe full period the storm had lasted to its remorseless fury, was suddenly impressed with an idea that this peal of thunder was a negative answer to her appeal for protection aud for succour. She sprung to her feet and with a shriek of despair she dashed out of the hall. Heron had scarcely sufficiently recovered from his surprise at the fury of the tempest and the ap pearance of this apparent maniac, to stay her progress, but he did make a dart on to the wide steps of Whitcombe House, and caught at some of the tattered fragments of apparel whiuh the poor drenches .creature wore. They gave way at his touch, bnt still her pro gress was stayed for a moment, and, facing the house, she raised her arms above her head, glanc ing upwards at the sculptured coat of arms of the Whitcombe family, which was above the pediment of the doorway. The shriek she uttered was truly appalling \"His house! bis home!\" she cried. \"I am lost \u2014 lost ! Oh, what fule has brought my foot steps hither?\" She turned and fled into tbe night air at a speed which rendered all pursuit vain Stunned and bewildered bj the . rapidity of events, and with a feeling at nis inmost heart which he could not define, to the effect that, in some strange manner, even this poor maniao \u2014 if such she were \u2014 w_is mingled up with the chequered woof of his fortunes, Felix Heron placed his hands upon his brow, and staggering back into the hall of Whitcombe House, he asked himself if he were suffering from some fearful dream, or if, indeed, he were awake and in the world of realities. Edith stood at the top of the grand staircase, and would have flown down to the hall, but that she saw Colonel Trelawney and the Earl of Bridge- water ascending and bearing with them the bur- then of some one upon whom death had set its seal. Felix Heron flung open wide the massive doors of Whitcombe House He felt that the murderer must haye issued forth after perpetrating the deed of blood ; for there came back to him the reflection that while in the saloon he had heard a sound as if the door had been closed by some one as noise- lessly as possible, and yet not so noiselessly as to preclude all sound Pull of wonders, marvels, and surprises as had been that house, and listening as he was at that time to the soul-enthralling narration from the lips of Lady Castleneau, FeUx Heron had heeded nothing of any strange sounds that had come npon the night air in that deserted mansion. Now, however, every resollection of the kind had a terrible significance ; and therefore was it that Heron flung open the hall doors by a natural im- pulse, as that was the track on which the murderer had gone. That terrible avalanche of rain which we have described in the first chapter of this sequel to the adventures of Edith and Felix Heron, was at its height. The loud, despairing cry uttered by Felix Heron was, so to speak, crushed and beaten down by the descending flood. He seemed to stand before the face of a cataract ; and as, with a look of amazement at the state of affairs without, which the intensity of his emotions within the house had prevented him from remarking, he was gazing forth into the darkness, and listening to the rush of water, there staggered into the ball a drenched and hideous object. A woman, enveloped in rags, from which the rain poured in a hundred petty streamlets, feU at his feet, and, with a wailing, shrieking voice, seemed to seek for aid and such charitable shelter as no one could refuse on such a night of terror. \" Help I help ! \u2014 oh, help I This is the end of all things.

He fell upon what seemed to him to be a bed ol very soft earth. shelter within the sacred walls of Westminster Abbey, was intense, as the flash of lanterns shone along the shadowy aisle. The few words that one of the persons uttered who were pacing up that aisle, let Wild know and ,'eel his danger. The officers of the law, no doubt assisted by some of the officials of the Abbey, were in pursuit of him. It was sawdust A deep layer of sawdust, soaked through with the damps of ages, which lay at the bottom of the steps, and covered up the floor of the vault. It was a house of the dead into which Jonathan Wild and Lord Warringdale had penetrated. The air was thin and sickly \u2014 a strange odour filled the confined space. Lord Warringdale gasped, and a sense of incipient suffocation came over him. Lord Warringdale, too, felt at that moment as if all hope of escape and safety had passed away. \" Quick ! quick !\" said Jonathan Wild. \"Quick with the moveable stone, or we are lost!\" \"Lost! lost!\" murmured Warringdale. \" Idiot I Is this a moment for lamentation ?\" \"Jonathan Wild! Jonathan Wild!\" he said. \" Better\u2014 oh, far better to accept the mer ;ies of human justice than perish in such a place as this!\" \" Nothing can save us !\" \" Then die in your despair ! Be captured and hnng, as assuredly you will !\" \" No, no ! Oh, save me !\" \" Save yon ? I save you ? Yet, perhaps, I should do so for my own sake.\" The very rational idea had come to Wild's mind that if Lord Warringdale were taken be would, in all probability, make an attempt to bespeak some mercy for himself by denouncing him, Wild. That was a state of affairs to be dreaded. \" Stuff !\" said Wild. \" But there is no air \u2014 I cannot breathe!\" \" Yon will directly. There !\" A cool gush of fresh air came upon the brow of the nearly fainting Warringdale. \" What have you done, Jonathan ? How have you brought the fresh air of heaven into this place ?\" \" Easily enough. Those fools who think that we are to be found for the looking for with a lan tern, have left the chapel, quite satisfied that we are not in it, so I have moved the stone a little, and it now lets into this vault a stream of fresh air from the Abbey.\" Jonathan Wild, therefore, dragged Lord War ringdale through the narrow aperture of the chapel, and had just time to close the blue, slaty looking stone which so effectually concealed the entrance, as eome constables and vergers of the cathedral entered the chapel. The place in which Wild and Warringdale fonnd themselves, immediately on the other side of the narrow aperture, was anything but an agree able one. \" It is welcome.\" \" Of course it is. You did not think that I was going to let myself be smothered like a rat in a hole, whose way out is stopped by a trowel full of mortar, and a broken bottle?\" \" No\u2014 no ! you are great in resources, Jonathan Wild \u2014 I will say that for yon.\" \"Bah! bo!\" They were at the top of a narrow, slanting flight of stone steps. Slimy with damp, and that description of moss which finds a home even in the most uninviting situations, these old steps, upon which probably no human footstep had trodden for some hundreds of years, were difficult to maintain a foothold npon. Jonathan Wild was not amenable to compli ments, especially when he knew that they arose from the abject fears of his companion. \" What are you doing now, Wild ?\" asked War ringdale, in a faint, weak voice. \"Getting alight\" \"A light! Oh, surely tbat is dangerous in this place!\" \" Not now. I want to look about me, and to see what kind of a crib this is we are in. It may have some other outlet for all I know to the contrary, that may be useful to us. I am seldom without my matches.\" Jonathan Wild lit one of the \" thieves' matches\" be had with him, and then, among a strange col lection of miscellaneous articles iu his pockets, he found a little, grimy bit of coiled up wax-taper. Another moment and he had rectified the broken down wick with his fingers, and lit the taper. \" Now where are we ?\" Lord Warringdale slid down about half-a-dozen of them. Jonathan Wild held him by the collar of his coat, and uttered between his teeth the most hor rible maledictions npon Warringdale if he dared to give the least alarm. Situated where he was, Wild's head was close to the bine, slaty stone. The voices of the persons in the chapel came to him as though they were the echoes of human voices from a very long distance. \" Some sacrilegious villains,\" said one of the speakers, \" have certainly broken into the Abbey !\" \" They cannot escape,\" said another. \" No ; for every entrance is now guarded.\" \" Indeed !\" muttered Wild. Lord Warringdale uttered a low groan. Owing to the manner in which Jonathan Wild was holding him, he was nearly suffocated, for Jonathan had get a clutch at his throat as well as at the collar of his coat and the consequence was that it was drawn with an uncomfortable tight ness. Wild held the taper above his head, and as the tiny flame increased until it was as bright as with the small quantity of food it got as it could be, he looked about him. Wild was on his knees. Lord Warringdale was lifting upon the damp, deeply laid sawdust In silent interest these two men gazed about them for some few minntes. \" What's the matter ?\" growled Wild \u00bb I choke !\" \"Bah !\" The place in which they were was not above fifteen feet square. The ceiling was vaulted, and it seemed to be all bnilt of blocks of massive stone. In each wall there were two recesses, no doubt for the reception of coffins. \" Have some mercy upon me !\" \" Go down, then.\" Jonathan Wild relaxed his hold of the wretched Loid Warringdale, and almost in a state of insen-"], [19, "EDITH HERON. 13 That ft was some old neglected family vault there could be no doubt It was, in truth, a gilt coffin-plate. There ad hered to it some pieces of the decayed wood o? the lid of the coffin, and two of the screws whioh had held it in its place. Jonathan Wild uttered a cry of surprise as he read the inscription upon the plate. \"What is it? What do you see?\" anxiously inquired Lord Warringdale. _\u25a0 The most curious circumstance that conld hap pen to us \" replied Wild. \"What? Oh! what?\" In two of the recesses there were black, dismal looking masses of something which had no doubt at one time, many years before, been symmetrically shaped coffins. In shapeless masses they had fallen in upon the deal, and were decaying along with the remains of poor humanity which they had contained. Lord Warringdale shuddered and groaned. \" What's the matter now ?\" said Wild \" This is a fearful place.\" \"This? Why?\" \" It is the home of the dead \u2014 of the dead \" Read for yourself.\" Jonathan Wild held the gilt plate in such a po sition to the light that Lord Warringdale could easily read it To the surprise of the latter he saw the follow ing inscription npon the gold : \u2014 alone !\" \"Oh, is it? Then it just suits me; for, of all the places in the world, it is the home of the living that I am shy of at present\" \" Oh, Jonathan Wild !\u2014 Jonathan Wild 1 What shall we do ?

I don't mind a bit calling things by their right names.\" \"Well, well, he is at the height of rank\u2014 of wealth \u2014 and happiness!\" \" That's it.\" \" Well,\" said Wild, \" what think yon of this ?\" \"It is strange \u2014 it is passing strange!

Wild shook his head. \" Ha ! ha ! You are better already, my friend Lord Warringdale! Why, yon are plucking np a spirit ! You said that quite in yonr old style, when you could walk down St James's Street, and few men dared to take the wall of you 1\" \" Do not taunt me with what I was I\" \" You heard something ?\" \"I did.\" \" What \u2014 what did yon suppose it was, Jona than ?\" \" I taunt yon ?

The opening has been long enough to ventilate the place, and it will be a good while before we find the air oppressive.\" \" Yes, yes ; close it, Wild. There may be some night-watch now in the Abbey.\" \" It is likely enough.\" Jonathan Wild crept cautiously up the slippery narrow stone steps, and closed the secret entrance to the vault from the chapel above. He then de scended again, and heaping up the sawdust, he took a piece of one of the broken coffins, to whioh some faded crimson velvet was still adhering, and made himself a kind of seat This fall had brought with it some of the dead. Some poor remnants too of mortality, in the shape of bones and dust, lay in a disordered fashion among the heap of broken rubbish. The glittering object, by one of those apparent caprices of the physical forces of nature, had pre served its brightness scarcely impaired. Bnt Lord Warringdale was by no means disposed to lift it from the heap of remains among which it lav \" Coward I\" said Wild. \" What do you fear ?\" Warringdale turned aside with a shudder. \" Hold the light, then !\" \" Yes, Wild\u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014 will hold the light !\" It was quite evident that Jonathan Wild, as possessing the stronger mind of the two, was ra pidly assuming that kind of supremacy over the wretched Warringdale that would make him his bond slave. '\u25a0 That's comfortable,\" he said. \" How my bones do ache, to be sure!\" \" Well, Wild, what have you got to say ?\" \" I have to tell you how it was that I found ont the existence of this vault, which appears to have Wild strode towards the glittering object on the floor, aud lifted it to the light"], [20, "14 EDITH HEI! ON. been so completely forgotten, or into which there is perhaps some other opening that the old plans cf the Abbey might show.\" \" It is likely.\" \" But, however, this entrance from the chapel above is, I think, known only to us two and one other person.\" Lord Warringdale uttered a cry of dismay. \" Do you mean to say, Wild, that it is ki. own to any one else ?\" \" I do.\" \" Then we are in that person's power !\" \" Nonsense ! Ho ft is that other person to know that we are here ?\" \" Stolen jewels.\" \"Indeed?\" u Yes. I knew the fellow had been disposing of some unset diamonds, and I thought it probable he might be carrying on a snug little private busi- ness in that line with some cracksmen or kuigh s of the road, who ought to have come to me with the swag\" \"And you were disappointed?\" \" I was so far ; but among other things I found a book, on the inner cover of which was carefully sketched a plan of this little chapel of West- minster Abbey above, and in which is the remark- able tomb of the four kneeling figures. It attracted my attention, because I recognised the tomb at once, and I saw that at one part of the plan there were the words 'The Stone' written I could make no more of it at the moment, and I left the book as I found it ; but I took an early oppor- tunity of getting into the Abbey quietly and alone, and bearing in mind pretty well the exact spot in the wall, I ascertained, after a few trials, that that blue, Jiaty-looking stone we have just closed upon ourselves was moveable ; and now you know all about it, Warringdale.\" \" It is very strange.\" \" Well, it is susceptible of some explanation. I can't see what possible inter e-t Raphael could have in an old family vault.\" \" And the original vault _ the Whitcombes, too.\" \" Well, well ! Go on.\" The small taper light with which Jonathan Wild had in some measure scattered the intense darkness of that vault, was still burning, but be fore he spoke again\u2014 somewhat to the dismay of Lord Warringdale\u2014 Wild blew it out. The darkness seemed to fall like a funeral pall upon them. \" Light ! light !\" said Lord Warringdale. \" Let us have light in this dreadful place. Without that light\u2014 insignificant as it was \u2014 I seem as if I could not exist here. The walls collapse \u2014 the roof appears to descend upon our heads ! Light it again, Jonathan Wild \u2014 in mercy, light it ag&in !\" \" No,\" said Wild, carelessly ; \" it is half burnt out already, and we may want it. What I have to say to you can just as well be said in the dark. Listen. I'm about to be very confidential.\" Lord Warringdale rested his head npon his hands, and listened. \" There is a man,\" said Wild, \" whom you know something of, who goes by the name of Raphael.\" \" Raphael, the chemist ?\" \" Oh, I perceive you know all about him ; and when I come to recollect, of course you ought, for U(.on that occasion when you fooli-hly imagined 1 was to be suffocated by the iumes of a dele terious composition, in a certain mansion \" \"Jonathan Wild! Jonathan Wild! one of our agreements has been that bygones should be by gones. Fora ceitain time I resisted you, and any one situated as I was would have done as much. Then I found it was much better to act with you than against you, and from that moment, as you well know, I regretted that the most perfect under standing had not always been between us \" \" That's candid,\" said Wild, \" and I like you the better for it However, it's not to the purpose at present\" \" No, no\u2014 it is not ! Go on, Wild, go on !\" \" Well, I had occasion to pay a vfsit to this Raphael \u2014 or I should rather say to his house, for I took good care he should not be at home. A couple of my men dogged him for a day or two unfl they got him into a lonely place, then they seized him, put him into a haokney-coach, and while one of them remained with him, the other hurried off to me to tell me the bird was caged.\" \"What wanted you with such a prisoner, Wild ?\" Scarcely had these words passed the lips of Lord Warringdale when he sprang to his feet, and Jonathan Wild rolled off the heap of sawdust and bit of coffiu lid on which he was seated, with sudden alarm ; for a sharp, well-defined, triangular gleam of light came right across the w\"ils of the vault It was a thousand chances to one but that e.ther Wild or Lord Warringdale would utter some ex clamation on the surprise of the moment ; and, per haps, if that surprise had been of a less startling character than it was, they might have done so ; but so totally and wholly unexpected was this dis turbance of their solitude, and this breaking up of tbe darkness in the vault, that they were awed and stunned into silence. The gleam of light widened, and played fantas tically upon the groined roof of the vault. Some one acquainted with the secret entrance had removed the stone in the vault of the chapel, and was slowly descending the slimy, slippery staircase, carrying a light of much greater power and intensity than that which Jonathan Wild had been able to produce from the grimy bit of taper he had in his pocket. Who could this person be ? Who, at that still hour of the night, was seeking the innermost recesses of that sacred fane ? Alone, too ; for there was cot the slightest sound indicative of the approach of more than one person. Alone \u2014 \u00bbmid the secrecy and solitude of that awfully imaginative spot \u2014 some one was certainly approaching, carrying a light into the receptacle of the dead. \" Nothing. I only wanted him out of the way for an hour while I overhauled his establish ment\" The Abbey clock struck two. Whoever it was descending that slippery, moss grown staircase, paused a moment as if to listen to the sounds. \" And you did so ?\" \" Of course I did. I've keys that will fit all locks, and I flatter myself I could give a tolerable account of Raphael's laboratory. I cannot say I found much to reward my search. \" \" What did yon hope to find ?\" Solemnly and grandly they echoed through the ancient building ; and then both Jonathan Wild and Lord Warringdale heard a voice. The voice of that strange intruder. \"Two o'clock. The mighty city sleeps surely."], [21, "EDITH HERON. 15 Now is the time to wrest the long-cherished secret .rom the forgotten tomb of the haughty Whit combes.\" me who is, or who is not, Earl of Whitcombe ? And yet such is human curiosity that \u2014 becoming possessed accidentally, as Ih-ive, of the secret that there is in this tomb concealed an iron box. tbe contents of which will be . ufHyent to proclaim the late proud and haughty Eirl of Whitcombe to have been an illegitimate possessor of the title \u2014 that I cannot refrain from a visit to this place, to satisfy myself of the truth of the statement,\" As he spoke, the mysterious visitant of the tomb turned, so that his fa^e first was presented to the gaze of Lord Warringdale, and then to that of Jonathan Wild. These words sounded solemn and distinct amid the intense stillness around ; and then this person who was carrying a light and who had slightly soliloquised upon his intentions, resumed his pro gress down into the vault From the first moment that the triangular gleam of light had startled Jonathan Wild and Lord Warringdale, to the time at which the first glimpse of the descending figure might be observed, could not have exceeded the lapse of one minute. That minute was quite sufficient for Jonathan Wild. They both knew him. \"Raphael, the chemist!\" whispered Warring dale to his own heart It had been sufficient time to convince him of several things of importance to his present posi tion. \" It is Raphael !\" muttered Wild- \" A small iron box,\" added Raphael, '! was placed here by the father of the late Earl of Whit oombe \u2014 grandfather to this Felix Heron\u2014 rrhn, up to this moment, for fourteen hours, has been tho acknowledged heir to the earldom.\" Warringdale almost gasped for breath. Jonathan Wild's eyes opened preternaturally wide, aud he would not have lost a syllable that Raphael uttered for hundreds ot pounds. The chemist sighed. \" No, no I\" he said. \" Let them dream on. Let Felix Heron and his Edith tread together the flowery path of life. Let me feel that I know that which would destroy them \u2014 if, indeed, to plunga them into obscurity would do so \u2014 and that I with hold my power. They will ever be present to my imagination, as creatures of my bounty \u2014 as exist ing by my grace and favour. I shall begin to love them, because I do so much for them ; and better far would it be for those documents which the iron box may contain to be in my power, than exposed to the cross accidents of discovery by some one who might make a nefarious use of them.\" Raphael went to the steps, and picked up the lantern. The person approaching was alone- He was no constable or officer of police in search of him, Wild. He was no authority of the Abbey, searching its inmost recesses to surrender sacrilegious intruders np to justice. No ; this mysterious person was bent npon some private errand, and although Wild felt at the moment he bad his life in his hands, he would much rather ascertain what that errand was, before ensuring his 0.\u2122 safety by the blow that would put an end to the existence of the stranger. Wild stretched out his hand and caught Lord Wartingdale by the arm. He drew his head close to him, and whispered in his ear. \" Into one of the recesses at once. Hide ; and we shall hear alL \" I dare not.\" Wild did not wait to hear what reply Warring dale made to the proposition, but immediately springing on to one of the shelves which was vacant he laid himself at full length, aud in the dusky interior of that vault might, at a moment's glance, have been mistaken for an effigy of the de parted dead. Lord Warringdale did not exactly follow Wild's example \u2014 he had not the courage and recklessness to assume such a position in such a place ; but as the stranger, with a lantern in his hand, reached the lowest step of the stone staircase, Warringdale flung himself down flat upon the sawdust, close against one of the side walls of the vault ; and sinking rather deeply into tbat thick stratum of damp dust, he was tolerably well hidden for the moment \" Far took, on one of these shelves,\" he said, \" the small iron box, or casket, will be found. Ah!\" He uttered a scream of terror. The light from the lantern had fallen full upon the face of Jonathan Wild. \" Well met!\" said Wild, as he assumed a sitting posture, and swung his ,egs over the edge of the shelf \u2014 \" well met, Riphael I I am Jonathan Wild I\" The man with the lantern stood in the vault. Then he placed his light upon the third step from the floor, and looked curiously about him. It was an ordinary lantern he had brought with him; and the light that gleamed from its lens, although radiating to a considerable extent, still left a good portion of the vault in deep shadow. These shadows were sharp, and abrupt like- wise ; and one of them\u2014 as Fortune would have it \u2014 completely enveloped Jonathan Wild. , The stranger spoke. \" And now that I am here,\" he eaid, \" I may well ask myself why I am here ; for I have gold enough.\" Those words were very welcome to Jonathan WUd, for they seemed to imply that some hidden store of wealth was to be found iu that secret place. CHAPTER VI. EDITH IS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE LAST REQUEST OF HER FATHER, THE JUDGE. Staggering bsck into Whitcombe House, like one who had received a mortal blow, Felix demn had shrunk from the storm without and from pursuit of the poor maniacal woman, whose every word seemed to have struck a pang to his heart And yet he knew not why. Human misery aud human destitution are not such rare things in this world of mighty changes, that this one example of them should wring the soul, as the few words spoken by that deaieutea' ore -ture did that of Felix Heron. Was it the marvellous instinot of nature tha. throbbed at his heart ? \" And why,\" added the strarger, \" should I disturb the happiness of the living, by these reve lations of the secrets of the dead ? What is it to Did some still, small voice almost tell him w&at we can tell the reader ?"], [22, "16 EDITH HERON. The name of that demented and wretched creature had been Amelia Staunton ! his arm tremblingly. \" Felix ! Felix ! make no rash vows.\" \" Is this a rash vow, dear one ?\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes ; all vows are rash.\" \" Nay, dearest, not such an one as this, with a dead father before my eyes.\" \" Yes, Felix, we do not know \u2014 we cannot know what may happen.\" \" Heaven's vengeance against murder must happen !\" \" Not vengeance, Felix, but justice. You in voke heaven \u2014 leave the murderer to heaven.\" \" And yet it has its ministers. Let me be this one.\" \" You are not yourself, dear Felix. This sight has stirred you past your gentle nature ; and think for a moment \u2014 only for a moment \u2014 if this murderer should be \" Yes ; it was\u2014 indeed, and in truth \u2014 the mother of the new Earl of Whitcombe who had shrunk, and shivered, and prayed for aid, on the steps of Whitcombe House! The tale of her death had been a fabrication, which had been imposed upon Lady Castlenean. Fearing the retribution which was likely to light npon their heads, the villanous keepers of the asylum at East Sheen had cast forth the long bar rassed intellect into the world, in the hope that they would never hear of it more, and had pos sessed Sir Dominick Browne with the idea that death had ended the sufferings of the peisecuted Amelia Staunton. Then those instruments of villany and injustice themselves had sled, and all clue was lost to the truth. \" Your heart names him, Edith ?\" \" No, no ; I do not name him.\" \" But you think the name.\" \" It may be so; and if onr thoughts are in common npon this terrible event, it is not for yonr arm to execute vengeance, although the guilt cries out from earth to heaven in its terrible atrocity.\" \" Let us relieve our hearts of this burden,\" cried Felix Heron, as he drew himself up to his full height, and looked upon the care-stricken faces around him. \" I do not say that it is my halt- brother, Lord Warringdale, who has committed this fearful act ; but if upon evidence I find that it is so, henceforth I cast aside all ties of brother- hood, and no feelings of consanguinity shall tempt me for a moment from the stern path of justice.\" \" We will speak of this no more,\" said Lady Castlenean. \" Truly, Felix, is your new earldoc inaugurated in sorrow I Whitcombe House is now a house of mourning.\" \" Yes,\" said Heron, \" and in it I remain. Until this sad spectacle is removed to the tomb, this is my place.\" \" And mine,\" said Edith. \" We will all stay with you, Whitcombe,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater ; \" and I am sure my friend, Colonel Trelawney, will oblige me by communicating, at the earliest dawn, these myste- rious events to the King himself.\" \" The highest authorities,\" said Colonel Tre- lawney, \" may well take cognizance of the murder of a peer.\" \" They will de so, bo assured,\" added Bridge- water. \" And now, Countess of Whitcombe, permit me to discharge a trust which has devolved upon me, at the request of tbe Chancellor. It is a painful one, but the argument he used I could not resist\" Alas ! alas ! What a world of misery \u2014 what a world of conjecture \u2014 what tears \u2014 whatheait de jection would have been spared, could Felix Heron have imagined, but for one fleeting moment, that the poor wanderer \u2014 who had appeared, like an ignus /atuus, for an instant to his eyes, only then to vanish again away into the night- tempest \u2014 was his mother ! But it was not to be. The time had not yet come \u2014 the course of events was not fulfilled ; and yet was Amelia Staunton much happier, exposed to the utmost wrath of heaven's storms, than when in the gloomy cell of the asylum, a victim to man's malevolence. Sne bieathes freely beneath the canopy of sea ven. The watchful eye of Providence is upon her. We must leave her for awhile ; and once again entering that princely abode in St. James's Street, we conduct the reader up that flight of stairs to the saloon, which L_dy Castleneau had fondly hoped would witness a happy meeting between the father and son. True \u2014 too true, there was now a meeting ; but grief and sadness was npon one countenance \u2014 death upon the other ! They laid the dead Earl of Whitcombe, in his peer's robes, upon a couoh. Felix Heron knelt by his side. \" Oh, for one moment of life!\" he cried. \" Oh, for one moment nf the li.ht of existence in those eyes \u2014 for one sentient feeling in the brain 1 Father ! father 1 Have you no voice to bless your son, and to hear him call npon heaven to witness his forgiveness and foigetfulness oi all the past?\" All present were deeply affected. It was Lady Castleneau, however, strange to say, who at that moment showed a strength of purpose, and a rationality of thought, which no other person could pretend to. \" Felix,\" she said, \" your father is no more, it is tt ue ; and that he has come to his end by some mysterious means is evident Your duty is now to justice, and to the living.\" \" Justice ?\" exclaimed Heron. \" Yes, I under stand you, Lady Castleneau \u2014 dear friend, I under stand you. I will track my father's murderer, if need be, throngh the habitable globe ; and here I register a vow in heaven, that should I be per mitted to meet him face to face, I will wait for no tardy law's delay to give me justice. With this sword, still stained with my father's life-blood, I will, in tbe name of offended heaven, revenge his murder.\" \" Ah, my lord! you have something to say to me which calls for grief.\" \" Truly so ; and fain would I have avoided being the medium of communication, but I was told it would better come from the lips of one whom you knew to be a friend, than to-morrow morning \u2014 as come it then must \u2014 upon the common rumour of the day.\" Edith turned pale. \"lean guess,\" she said; \"it is of my father you would speak?\" \" Even so.\" \" He is dead \u2014 your eyes tell me !\" \" Sir John Tarleton is, indeed, no more !\" \" Alas ! alas !

Edith looked up from the arms of Felix Heron, which, at the first mention of the actual death of her father, had been tenderly wound round her. \" Alas ! alas f Poor father !\" \" Upon searching the pockets of his apparel, Edith, a letter was found addressed to you.\" \"Tome?\" \" Yes. I now hand it to you, with the hope, and, indeed, under the circumstances, with the conviction, that it will pour balm into your suffer ing heart\" The Earl of Bridgewater produced a letter, sealed in black, which he banded to Edith. Her hand trembled as she took it, and she was glad to accept the chair which Colonel Trelawney wheeled towards her. \" Yes, Countess, your father \" \" Oh, do not you call me Countess ! To those who have been the dear friends of my hnsband, let me be no Countess, but ever Edith.\" The Earl of Bridgewater bowed. \" Thee, Edith, let me tell you that your father made to the Lord Chancellor a fell revelation of all his acts as connected with yonr property, and the iniquity in which Jonathan Wild n;id Lord Warringdale had so large a share.\" No. 8. \u2014 Edith Hebon. \" Read it now, my Edith,\" whispered Felix. \"You are surrounded by dear friends, who all sympathise in every feeling of your heart\" Edith handed the letter to Heron, and then, as she hid her face in her bands, sho said, \" You, dear Felix \u2014 you will read it to me.\" Heron was quite convinced that a letter from"], [24, "EDITH HKBON. 18 Lady Castleneau fully understood what Edith meant to imply, anV she said, gently, \" My dear, your father would not have made mention of the boy at all if the circumstances were not even as be has in that letter related them.\" Edith uttered a sigh of relief, and looked in the face of Felix, who, at he then again clasped her to his heart, said, \" Be comforted, my Edith ! The brightest dawn follows the darkest night!\" Sir John Tarleton, under such circumstances, would be more calculated to soothe the heart ef Edith than add to its afflictions ; therefore he had no hesitation in breaking the black seal and read ing the le' ter aloud. \" To my Child, Edith. \" I bave now not six hours to live, and I would fain say to you, my child, that if it be permitted me to 6tand a penitent at the Throne of thrones, my first petition will be for forgiveness of tbe many injuries I have done to thee. \" That yon may be happy\u2014 very, very happy with your Felix, is my last prayer. \" And now, my child, I have a revelation to make to yon.

Lord Warringdale, falsely so called, I find is his murderer. \" But, my child, there was another son of mine, who is jour own real brother. Within one year of my union with your mother, a son was born to us; and then I felt that the large fortune which my cupidity aimed at in the marriage, would pass away from me to that child. \" Do not start at these words : your father is not a murderer ; but he did take measures to per suade your mother the boy was lost at sea. In reality, the infant was given with a sum of money into the hands of a woman who was named Fclton, and who undertook to go at once to South America with it, and never appear again in Europe. \" Yonr poor mother only held up until you were born, and then died. Grief had sapped her existence, and I had not the courage to do by you as by the boy. \" Edith, you may have a brother living.

EXPLAINS FURTIU'R THE MIST.^RY OF THE VAULT AND THE IRON CASKET. The cry of terror and surprise that burst from the lips of Raphael, the chemist, tipon the sight of Jonathan Wild, as the latter sat up and glared at him from the recess in the vault, aronsed all the fear of Lord Warringdale. It will be recollected that he \u2014 Warringdale \u2014 had crouched down close to one of the walls of the vault. In sac;, he bad burrowed for himself a rjlace so deep in the damp sawdust that if even Raphael had looked earnestly in that direction, he would scarcely have seen him. The affrighted shout of the chemist was a trumpet note of alarm to Warringdale. What was taking place he could not see. His line of vision as he lay so low down was too re stricted to enable him to observe the movements of Jonathan Wild. Therefore Lord Warringdale was not aware that it was that movement which produced tbe cry of alarm from Raphael It might be, for all he knew to tbe contrary, a shout to some persons in the Abbey to come to his assistance. But, whatever it was, it struck terror to the heart of Warringdale, and deprived him of all reason or sensation but the one of escape. Out of the vault, it he could get into the open air \u2014 if he could but. make his way, he might have a chance for safety \u2014 a chance for life! Springing, then, to his feet, with the damp saw dust of the vault clinging in masses to bis ap p-rpl, Warringdale made a rush to tbe staircase. Now, if Jonathan Wild had had exactly the command of the movements of Lord Warringdale, this was what he would have desired him to do. Edith was deeply affected at the perusal of this letter ; and when Felix Heron's voice closed with those word6, \" Pray for your unhappy father,\" she burst into tears, and sobbed as though her ht art wonld break. But for that action, resulting from pure fright, Raphael, the chemist, might have escaped. As it was, however, Warringdale reached the foot of the stone steps in time to intercept the rapid reireai of the chemist. But those tears in their full tide relieved the surcharged heart of Edith. Those two men\u2014 each acting under the influence of sudden terror \u2014 encountered each other They fought and wrestled for a few seconds, and then they rolled together in the sawdust \" That will do !\" said Wild, as, with a move ment not at all in accordance with his usual des perate activity, he got out of the recess \u2014 it will be recollected he was badly bruised, \u2014 \" that will do ! You have him, my lord ; that was well done !\" Wild was giving Warringdale credit for an achievement which he certainly had never in tended. \" A brother!\" she said, when she could sj> u I have a brother !\" \"Yes, dear one!\" said Heron. \"It shall be Hy task to endeav ur to restore that long-lost brother to your hei p, and ia me he 6hall find a friend as well as a .rother.\" \" I had heard,\" said Lady Castlenean, \" from my poor sister of this grief.\" \" You did not tell me, aunt.\" \" No, my dear. I forbore to burden your young heart with the pains and the griefs of the past; but 1 little suspected the real truth.

What is it all about ?\" asked Warringdale. \" You heard ?\" those hideous laughs that broke so abruptly upon the ears of those who heard them, and then termi nated with such startling suddenness. \" What is too bad ? What do you mean?\" \" Why, it is too bad to suppose that we are such unfeeling wretches that we would commit a murder, even if it did answer our purposes to do so.\" The leer upon the face of Wild as he spolie, and the jeering tone in which he uttered the words, formed a horrible commentary upon the superficial sense of what be eaid. \" Only partially.\" \" Well, you acted anything but partially, at al) events ; for, but for you, this fellow must have escaped.\" Lord Warringdale began now to comprehend the situation a little better. \" Wha* shall w_ do ?\" he said. \" What can we dc?~ The expression that came over the face of Jona than Wild as unmistakably said \" Murdsr \" as if his lips bad given utterance to the word. Lord Warringdale shuddered. But by this time the chemist had recovered from his first surprise aud consternation. Raphael knew both his opponents. \"What is the meaning of all this, Jonathan Wild ?\" he said ; \" and why are you here ?\" \" Ah ! he knows me 1\" said Wild. Raphael felt that he was in the hands of a man alike destitute of pily or of remorse. He turned to Lord Warringdale. \" My lord, you are a young man \u2014 can you stand by and see a murder in cold blood?\" \" Stop !\" said Wild ; \"you talk illogically, my dear friend. In the first place, you assume the murder ; and in the second, if it should take place, what is to hinder my friend, Lord Warringdale, from sitting down ?\" This levity of Jonathan Wild's was truly hor rible. \" And me, too,\" said Warringdale. \" He knows me, too.\" \" Dangerous knowledge!\" added Wild. The chemist looked from one to the other of them, and he felt that he was in the bunds of men to whom murder was a familiar thing. Wilh a sudden movement of one of his arms he tried to plunge his hand into a pocket of ihe breast of bis coat. Warringdale, even, felt sick atbeitrt ; and, if the death of Raphael were a necessity of their posi tion, le felt that he would rather the tragedy nas over, than that Wild should torture his victim in the tiger fashion. There was a silence of a few moments' dura tion now, and it was broken by Wild. But Wild saw the movement, and prevented it. \" Oh, dear, no !\" he said. \" If you have any thing at all interesting in that pocket, Mr. Raphael, I will take it out You will please to be quiet.\" Wild, as he spoke, took from the neck of the chemist the cravat that was around it, and with professional speed and dexterity secured his hands by the wris'-s behind his back with it \" 1 think that will do !\" \" Come, now, make a clean breast of it, Raphael, and say what brings you here ?\" \"No, no!\" \"You will not?\" \"IwUl not!\" \" Then I must tell you. There is a certain iron box or casket \" Raphael groaned. \" And it contains some information that may be of the utmost importance to tbat young man, the highwayman Earl of Whitcombe.\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Ah, you may say 'No,' as long as yon like, but I heard so much; and now, Raphael, as I am a reasonable man, I will make terms with you.\" \"What terms?\" The chemict groaned. Lord Warringdale wiped from his brow the cold dew of fear that had settled npon it. \"We were nearly lost!\" he said. \" A miss is as good as a mile ! \" replied Jonathan. \" This man is alone !\" Raphael groaned again. The lamp which the chemist had brought with him into the vault shone now brightly upon his haggard and anxious features. If ever any man thought himself in the very presence of death, Raphael, the chemist, did so in tbat awful hour that he spent in the ancient and forgotten vault of the Whitcombes. Secured as he now was with his hands behind \" Simple ones. I want eome money, and I want, for a short time, a place of safety more comfortable than a family vault. I rather think you can help me to both of those things, if you like. Besides, if you please, you can be of infinite service to me and to my friend, Lord Warring dale, in time to come. What say you?\" \"No, no!\" \" Are you mad ?\" \" No. But I will say this much to you, Jona than Wild, and to you, my Lord Warringdale: if you are both here, as I suspect in the character of fugitives, because all your plots and plans have failed, and if yon want the means of escaping, I will furnish them, and keep your secret\" \"Is that all?\" his back, whatever might be the means of resist ance he really had about him, he was prevented from making use of them. Jonathan Wild made him sit np close to the heap of sawdust he bad collected for his own comfort, and then squatting beiore him like some huge toad, he looked him in the face as be spoke \" Good luck,\" he said, \" has brought you here, my fiiend.\" The chemist shook his bead. \" What more can I do ?\" \" PLo ! pho 1\" added Wild ; \" you differ from me ; but don't you know that what is one man's good is another man's bane ?\" The chemist spoke. \"Jonathan Wild!\" \" Join us in the destruction of thoBe whose suc cess has brought us low.\" \" No, no \u2014 never !\" \" And yet you are the man who vended poisons to the highest bidder ?\" \" I bad an object\" \"Ha! ha! An object?\" \" Yes ; I wanted a certain sum of money. I let the world make what war they choose upon each other\u2014 and jet I have not done all the mischief that men think.\" \" That's me\u2014 go on !\" \" I do not know for what purpose you and my Lord of Warringdale are here, but whatever that purpose may be it cannot be forwarded by taking oi y life.\" \"Now that's too bad!\" said Wild, with one of"], [26, "20 EDsTH HERON. I I \" Little or much,\" said Wild, \" you will do no upon the words, and Jonathan Wild read them in a low, murmuring voice : \u2014 more.\" u Oh, not here \u2014 not yet !\" said Warringdale. M Let him live yet a little time.\" \"For what?\" yelled Wild. \" And yet, when I come to think of it, he shall live until he has pointed ont to us exactly where to look for the iron casket he spoke of.\" The chemist pointed to one of the recesses of the vault, as he said, faintly, \" It should be there.\" \"If it be the will of Providence that this iron casket, in which I, Hugh de Mowbray, Earl of Whitcombe, place this record, should be discovered, that will be done; otherwise the tomb will alone be the depository of the fact which this paper proclaims. \" I am the last member of the elder braneh of the Whitcombes. To the world it seems that I bave a son who may legitimately succeed to my titles and to my estates ; but he who is now waiting for my death, and enjoying in prospect the Earldom of Whitcombe, is no son of mine. Who and what he is it is needless to inquire, but I had no son. \" See to him,\" said Wild, and then he com menced a hasty search in the recess. There was a coffin there ; but Wild, in his im patience, seized one of the handles and dragged it down with a crash to the floor of the vault Some thing heavy and compact came down with it Wild uttered an exclamation of triumph. The something heavy was an iron box or casket, about eight inches in length and four in width. \" The title and the estates of Whitcombe, ac cording to tbe original grants, failing male issue of the elder branch of the family, descend to the younger branch. \" My grandfather, the fifth Earl, had a brother, who became an adventurer by sea and land. He took tbe name of Weldt, owing to a marriage he contracted with the heiress of a Dutch family. Dead and gone long since is he; but bis represen tative, if there be a male one now alive, is the true Earl ot Whitcombe. But the casket was locked. \" The key ! the key !\" cried Wild, as he ap proached Raphael. \" Where is the key ?\" \" I have it not \" \" You lie ! Give me the key !\" \" As I now live, I have it not ! This is the first time I bave seen tbat casket\" Wild raised the iron box in both his hands threateningly. Raphael uttered a cry of despair. Lord Warringdale closed his eyes. There was a blow struck, and when Warringdale looked again he saw that the chemist lay motionless on the floor of the vault \" My supposed son, proud, haughty, and a liber tine, as he is, has no right to the title ; but if it be the will of heaven he should enjoy it and his de scendants after him, then I believe this casket will never see the light of day. \" If otherwise, some apparently extraordinary accident, but which will in reality be the order and the design of Providence, will bring it to light \" The proofs of this statement will be found in the possession of a family named Dumare, and they reside in an old hunting lodge of the Forest of Vincennes, in France. \" That it is true, I, Hugh de Mowbray, Earl of Whitcombe, declare, eo help me heaven ; and I seal this paper with my seal, and I sign it with my name, There was blood upon the iron casket. The eyes of Jonathan Wild blazed with a con centrated fury. \" Pshaw !\" he cried ; \" don't look at me in that fashion, my lord. What use was this man to us? He had fallen into his dotage. If yon don't like the look of the carrion, remove it\" \" More murder !\" faltered Warringdale. \" Ha ! ba ! Our conscience has twinges, has it ? Ha ! ha ! Well, considering that my Lord Warringdale has some two or three little affairs of this sort to answer for, he is, I must say, a little troublesome at present with his scruples.\" Wild began to beat the small iron casket ou the floor of the vanlt, in the hope that by so doing be should dash it open. But the lock remained firm. \" Hugh de Mowbray, \" Earl of Whitcombe.\" Jonathan Wild looked up into the face of Lord Warringdale, aud indulged in a long whittle. Warringdale was as pale as death. \" What\u2014 what,\" he gasped\u2014\" what does it mean ?\" Then he went to the stone steps. One blow upon the lower step not only burst the casket open, but cracked the stop itself right across- \" It means,\" said Wild, triumphantly, \" that there is another claimant in the world to the Earldom of Whitcombe, besides you and Captain Heron\" * \" That will do,\" said Wild. From the open casket there came ont on to the sawdust a roll of parchment \" Hold the lantern !\" said Wild. \" This is strange indeed !\" \" It is ; but it is quite clear to me. This paper has been written by tbe late E irl's father.\" \" By Felix Heron's grandfather ?\" \"Just so; and it disposes pretty neatly of the claim of Felix Heron to the Earldom of Whit combe.\" Lord Warringdale obeyed him. The frantic vehemence of Jonathan Wild's ac- tions for the last few minutes had completely awed Warringdale into submission. He held the lantern as if he had been some very humble dependant of Jonathan Wild's. The parchment was fresh and new-looking. Its place in the iron casket had completely pre served it from the influences of that damp and dismal vault \" And my claim, too.\" \" Oh, yes ! There can be no doubt about that Not tbat your claim was worth much at any time.\" Lord Warringdale bit bis lips. \" Well,\" added Wild, \" it shall go hard with me but I make some capital use of this bit of parchment I almost feel inclined to sally out upon the strength of it, and show myself to the world again.\" \" You w\u00bbuld not be so imprudent !\" \" Let me think.\" The writing upon it was in a large, but tremu lous-looking band, as though some aged person bad sought to give great distinctness to what would otherwise have been a nerveless hand writing. The broad gleam from Raphael's lantern fell"], [27, "EDITH HERON, 21 Jonathan Wild knitted his brows, in thought for a time, and then bending a curious glance upon Lord Warringdale, he said, \" Look you here ! It is possible enough that in the coat and vest and hat and cravat of this fool, who is dead at our feet, I may escape.\" \" And I ?\" CHAPTER VIII. EIGHT DATS ELAPSE, AND EDITH MEET3 WITH A STRANGE ADVENTURE. It was at mid-day on the morning following that most eventful night at Whitcombe House, that Felix Heron, mounted on Daisy, and followed by Ogle and Tom Ripon, both well mounted, rode into Epping Forest In the midst of all the desolate feelings which had come over him, in consequence of the sudden and extraordinary death of his father, and in the midst of all the mysterious perplexities which the manner of that death occasioned, Felix Heron was far from unmindful of his old associates in the forest. \" Oh, as to you \u2014 why \u2014 why \" \" Jonathan Wild, would you abandon me ?\" \"No; I shall want you. I have a plan in my head. It is as yet rather immature ; but I shall want you, I fancy, to assist in it\" \" What plan ?\" \" It is too vague for me to explain it to you. Be assured, however, of one thing ; and that is, that I will not abandon you here.\" \" Hem! hem ! You do not surely mean even to leave me here?\" \" I must\" After considerable persuasion on the night pre vious, he had induced Edith to accompany Lady Castleneau to Castleneau House, as being a much more fitting abode for her than the gloomy one presented by Whitcombe House. The murdered Earl of Whitcombe might be said to lie in state in the principal saloon of that splendid mansion in St James's Street There had been no difficulty whatever in pro curing at once a sufficient retinue of servants wherewith to make up a kind of establishment at Whitcombe Honse. \" No, no ! I shall go mad \u2014 mad, if left here alone!\" \" Pho, pho ! I leave Mr. Raphael to keep you company.\" \" The dead ! The murdered 1\" \" Silence, I say ! It must be done. I will risk going forth in the disguise of the greater part of this man's apparel, when the Abbey is open for the day. So soon as the shades of evening make it safe for me to do so, I will come back to you, and bring yon such a disguise as you may easily walk out in.\" Before the morning had advanced one hour the old mansion began to look life-like. Its domestic offices were peopled by attendants ; the genial warmth of artificial heat made itself felt upon its staircases and in its chambers. Lord Warringdale shook in every limb \u2014 his teeth chattered in his head. \" Am I to remain here, then, in this awful place for a whole day ?\" \" You are unreasonable,\" said Wild, as he pro ceeded to make the change in his garments with Raphael that he had mentioned, \u2014 \" you are un reasonable. Here is the ancient family vault of your own ancestors, and some of that worthy family of the Whitcombes to keep you company, aud yet you object ! It's too bad !\" \" But, Jonathan Wild \" \" Nay, I call it a slight upon your relations.\" The Abbey clo_k struck the hour of six. \" Ah!\" said Wild; \" it is morning. In another hour the Abbey will be open for early prayers, and then I can slip out among the pious people who come in the cold at such an hour to perform their religions exercises.\" \" No, no !\" groaned Warringdale. \" I shall never bo able to remain alone in this place.\" \" Please yourself.\" \"How? How am I to please myself?\" \" By walking out of it, and chancing detection, if yon like.\" \" I will do so.\" But every blind was drawn down, for death was in the house. Lying still, in his peer's robes, upon that couch where he had been placed by his son Felix, assisted by the Earl of Bridgewater and Colonel Tre lawney, was the late Earl. More calm, more placid, and more at peace with himself and all the world than ever he had been during his proud and naughty career, lay the man who certainly \u2014 if ever human soul repented of great iniquity \u2014 did so before the hand of death closed npon him. And then Felix Heron felt that his duty was to the living. By the earliest possible hour that he could do so he wrapped a cloak abont him, and repaired on foot to the honse of the Home Secretary of State. The new Earl was anxions upon a subject which he felt ought to awaken all his sympathies, and engage much of his attention. He wished to be assured more particularly than be had been already of the immunity of his old comrades in the forest from prosecution, on ac count of those acts which had been perpetrated at his instigation and in his society. The Minister could not very well deny himself to the Earl of Whitcembe ; and the interview took place in the handsome breakfast-room, where the Home Secretary was sipping his chocolate, with tbe air of a man well satisfied with himself. Jonathan Wild shrugged np his shoulders, as though he would have said, \" A wilful man must have his way,\" and then he carefully eoncealed about him the most important parchment document he had obtained from the iron casket \" Help me,\" said Jonathan, then. \" Help you to what ?\" \" To pick up this dead bit of science off the floor, and place him comfortably in one of the re cesses. I warrant you, now, this Raphael never thought that when be was dead he would be in dulged with the luxury of a family vault\" Felix Heron, the new Earl of Whitcombe, was the last man in the world to be trifled with. He was just the person to ask the most direct questions, and not to be satisfied until he got the most lucid answers. \" Mr. Secretary,\" he said, \" you must be well aware that his Majesty had much to pardon me for.\" \"Oh, my lord \" commenced the Secretary with a smile."], [28, "22 EDITH HERON. \" Nuv, really, sir, I do not come for compli ments, but on a business which rests very near my heart. His Majesty was graciously pleased, when it became apparent that I was the real and undoubted Earl of Whitcombe, to grant me under bis own hand a free pardon for p\u00bbst offences.\" \" Most assure, ly.\" \" The Earl of Bridgewater is of opinion that it will not be possible to prosecute any of those men who acted in concert with me, while I \u2014 certainly the principal iffender \u2014 escaped scot free.\" The Home Secretary slowly rubbed his chin and looked np at the ceiling. \" I want however,\" added Heron, \" to be as sured of that I do not want it to be a mere matter of opinion or of consistency \u2014 I want it to be mater of fact\" liver,' and there is no such thing as \u2014 as mystify ing him. However, I must save my own reputa tion by the sacrifice of Jonathan Wild. I shall feel easier wheu once a rope is tightly round that rascal's neck.\" It would appear from these words of the Home Secretary that the escape of Jonathan Wild from Newgate, although it had happened some eight or ten hours previously, was not yet known. In faot, the authorities of tho prison wire iu uo hurry to proclaim the fact that they had not been able to keep Wild within its walls. As it was partly by their connivance he hud escaped \u2014 because he knew so much about the corruption aud villany of the whole establishment, that, if driven to be desperate, he might make dangerous revelations \u2014 they wished to give him as long a start as possible, in the hope that he would consult his own safety and theirs by leaving the country. The render happens to know that Jonathan Wild had no such intention, and that he was yet very likely to be exceedingly vexatious to the au thorities. \" Weil, my lord, of one thing I can assure yon ; and that is, that the principal person who would have given any trouble in this matter, is disposed of.\" \" Of whom speak you?\" \" Of Jonathan Wild.\" Heron made an impatient gesture. \"Nay, my lord,\" added the Secretary, \"Jona than Wild is, I assure you, in Newgate; aud we are so heartily sick of him and all his malprac tices, that we are only pausing to collect materials for two or three indictments against him, so that he may not \u2014 as large flies are apt to do \u2014 break through the cobwebs of the law, and escape.\" \" I have nothing to do, Mr. Secretary, with Jonathan Wild, and wish to have nothing to do with him. If be met his deseits at my hands, he would at the same moment meet his death. It is concerning those men whom I have left in Epping Forest that I am anxious.\" Our business now, however, is with Felix Heron. Immediately upon leaving the Home Secretary he went to Castleneau House, where, it will be recollected, Lady Castleneau had accommodated Ogle and Tom Ripon, not only with lodging for themselves, but for their two horses, and for Cap tain Heron's steed Daisy, with whom he had in tended to ride to Epping Forest the night pre vious. There was a look of anxiety upon the face o* Heron as he entered the breakfast-room at Castle neau House, but Edith might easily attribute it to the night of sadness he bad passed, at Whitcombe House, with his dead father. The smile with which he greeted her was rather assumed than real. \" Well, my lord, I think, on my conscience, that Jonathan Wild is the only one who would ha.ve troubled them, and that they need be under no apprehension whatever, since he will be hanged.\" \u2022' Then I am to understand that they will not receive a pardon in full?\" \" 1 would not advise your lordship to tronble his Majesty about them. I suppose they are a set of scurvy knaves, who, if they were pardoned up to twelve o'clock to-day, would manage before nightfall to qualify themselves for a ride to Ty burn ?\" \" You will stay with us now, Felix,\" she said, \" and leave that gloomy mansion to the care of others ?\" \" Nay, Edith, I have yet another duty to per form. Think of my comrades in the forest ; they await news of me with anxiety. I have even now had an interview with the Home Secretary ; and \u2014 although I have no reason to believe that they are in present danger \u2014 I yet feel that they are not so tate as I would wish them to be. In a word, dear Edith, it is necessary to my honour \u2014 it is neces sary to my peace of mind, lhat I ride to-day to Epping Forest\" Felix Heron was not apt to indulge in false sentiment, and the tone in which he uttered these words was quite convincing to Edith. -\"You are right, Felix \u2014 you are right!\" she said ; u it is a duty .which you and I owe to those who have stood by our sides in circumstances of difficulty and danger. We will go at once.\" \" Nay, Edith, not you. Let me, for once, feel that you are in safety and protection, and that no harm dare assail you, although I may be miles distant from you. A sharp ride, with Ogle and Tom Ripon, will soon place us beneath the leafy glades of old Eoping. My object is to provide the band with ample means, and to bid them disperse at once ; although I still have a hope of procuring the King's signature to the document, containing the whole of their names, which shall pardon and condone all past offences.\" Lady Castleneau cast an imploring look upon Edith\u2014 a look which spoke lather reproachful!} upon the subject of Edith leaving her so soon \" It is enough, Mr. Secretary,\" said Felix Heron, as he rose. \" I have had your answer, and must take my own course. I grieve to say that bis Majesty will be troubled about another matter this morning, that concerns me and the house of Whitcombe. Colonel Trelawney, of the Guard, however, has kindly undertaken to make the King acquainted with the strangest story to be found connected with the peerage of England.\" \" My lord, my lord, I should have been most happy myself to have been the medium of any communication to the King ; and, even now, if your lordship will inform me\u2014\u2014\" \" My time is not my own,\" interrupted Felix Heron. \" I have got to look after those same scurvy knaves that you have mentioned, who, you think, will qualify themselves so readily for Ty burn. So, Mr. Secretary, I bid you good morn ing.\" Felix Heron strode away without further ques tion or reply. The Home Secretary looked after him malevo lently. \" I don't like that man at all,\" he muttered. \" Lord Warringdale suited me much better. He talks to one as if he would say, ' Staud and de-"], [29, "EDITH HERON. 23 5 i and if she, Edith, had been inclined to press the point with Felix, that look would have been suffi cient to induce her at once to remain. I not content to live and die here in my sorest home? For what have I reaped, amiil the din and smoke of the great city, but anxiety and care ?\" \" Go, Felix \u2014 go !\" she said ; \" and heaven pro tect you ! Yen will be assured that I am as happy as I can be whilo separated from you, because I am by the side of my dear Aunt Castleneau.\" In ten minutes more Felix Heron was mounted upon Daisy, and, followed by Tom Ripon and Ogle, was proceeding at a fast tiot towards Epping Forest \" Bravo, Captain ! Hurrah !\" cried Tom, as he flung his cap up so high that it lit in a tree. \" Hurrah ! We'll go on the road again !\" \" Nothing better for me,\" said Ogle. \" I'm as willing as a cat is to empty a cream-pot.\" \"Oh, it's all right!\" added Tom. \"I see the Captain means it We'll get Lady Edith here back again. The summer's a comin', and we shall have rare times in the old forest\" And so it was that, as we have recorded at the commencement of this chapter, by about mid-day Heron and his two faithful companions and fol lowers trotted into one of the beautiful glades of Epping Forest. How fair and how peculiar did the scene ap pear to him ! How true it is that we measure time rather by its actual events than by its progress ! To Felix Heron it appeared as if be had been away for months \u2014 nay, years from his woodland home ; and although everything around him wan as familiar as his own right hand, yet immense, in deed, seemed to be tbe space of time which had div'ded him from those well-known objects- The sun was high in the heavens, and through the trees which arched overhead \u2014 mingling their topmost branches in graceful and beautiful con fusion \u2014 but a 6ubdued and gentle light found its way npon the green turf beneath. Here and there bright sparkling specks of sun light came through crevices, and danced in beauty on the verdant forest path. And there was that rustling sound, when light airs stir the tree-tops, which ever produces that dreamy, languishing tone in the air of a forest Felix Heron halted. Heron shook his head. \" No, no \u2014 it cannot be. Destiny, fate, or cir cumstances what you will, call me to other scenes. I fear the light heart of Captain Heron bas fled, or he has given it in exchange for the heavier one sf the Earl of Whitcombe.\" There was so much sadness in the tones of Heron, that both Tom Eipon and Ogle loo red at each other in silence for a minute, neither of them liking to interrupt the reverie into which he 6eemed to have fallen. A deep stillness was in the forest, only broken, for a few moments, by a young fawn bounding across the glade and disappearing in the thici brushwood. Then Heron looked up \" Why do I thus give way,\" he said, \" to gloomy fancies ? I could not have supposed that this forest life had such charms for me. Perhaps I forget all its anxieties, as we are apt to do those of any state through which we have passed, looking back only on the bright spots of the past, and losing the dark ones in the shadows of distance.\" Tom trotted up to Heron's side. \" Captain ! Captain !\" \"What is it, Tom?\" \" It is Wednesday, Captain, and the Oxford mail, you know, passes to-night!\" \" What then, Tom ?\" \" Don't you recollect, Captain, we stopped it once in the middle of a snow-drift, and the guard tried to fire his blunderbuss at us, only the snow had been goin' into it for two hours, and it was choke full?\" A deep sigh came from his breast \" Was I happier here,\" he said, \" as the free Captain Heron, holding my home and state be neath these glorious trees, than I shall ever be as Earl of Whitcombe, in the perfumed atmosphere of courts, and amid the cabals and intrigues of sense less ambition I\" \" To be sure, Captain,\" said Ogle, who. hearing the words, thought possibly they might have been addressed to him ; \" to be sure, Captain ; and Tom and I have just been talking about it\" \" Abont what, Ogle ?\" \" About what you've just been saying, Captain,\" cried Turn Ripnn. \" What did I say?\" \" Hem !\" added Ogle. \" I now find, Captain, yon were thinking aloud only, and that we oughtn't to have heard what you said.\" \" But it was as sensible as never was,\" said Tom, \" for all that ; and I tell yon what it is, Ogle ! I've been at yon all along the road, to per suade you to call the Captain my lord, and you won't do it. Now, Captain does he ever call you my lord ? But don't be go on, Captain, calling you Captain, my lord, as if yon wasn't a lord at all, Captain?\" \" Hold your row,\" said Ogle ; \" you call him Captain, as well as I do.\" Heron smiled. \" No, no, Tom ! No more Oxford mails for us. Ogle, is it not somewhut strange that we have penetrated thus far into the forest unchallenged by any of the scouts.\" \" It is, Captain,\" said 0,jle. \" They keep a bad look-out now ; or else they think, perhaps, that Oaptain Heron is no more, and don't wish to in trude upon the E .rl of Whitcombe.\" \"Signal them.\" \" That will I, with pleasure.\" \" No ! \u2014 let me !\" cried Tom. \" I have not en joyed a real good hoot, like an owl, for I don't know when ; and, besides, I can do it so well, that I'm quite sure I take in the owls themselves. Let me do it, Ogle.\" \" As you please, Tom \u2014 as yon please.\" Tom Ripon was quite delighted at the oppor tunity ; and placing his hands to his month in a peculiar manner, he made a hooting noise, in imitation of an owl, until the old for.st rang again. \"Beneath these forest trees,\" he said, \"let me forget that I am the Earl of Whitcombe. Let me rather show myself still the bold and daring knight of the road, with my gallant Daisy to carry me into and through any danger that may present itself.

With 6-fionfs ani cries, and *hen one lend \" Hurrah!'' which startled tbe birds from many"], [30, "24 ELITH HERON. a hiding-place among the old trees, Captain Heron's men assembled in that forest glade. What could they think?\u2014 what could they believe ? Had they, in truth, a fancy that he had come again among them, to be their leader in many a wild foray ? With an indistinct knowledge of all that had taken place in his fortunes, had they indeed a notion that he was going again to be to them the same Captain Heron he had been before ? It would almost seem so. Shout after shout of congratulation rose up from that beautiful glade. Daisy pricked up her ears, and pawed the ground with pleasure ; and then, with one accord, the band raised a well known signal ory, and it seemed as if Epping Forest had become the resi dence of all tbe owls in England. Captain Heron gazed from face to face, and some of his old animation lit up his eyes. \"Hear me!\" he said \u2014 \"hear me! 1 have ridden from London, to say something to you all, which it is a necessity, aa well as a grief, to me to say.\" The band was silent CHAPTER IX. FELIX HEBON FEELS THAT HE HAS A EEFUGB AGAINST THE STORMS OF FATE. One of the band \u2014 a man in whom Heron knew the others placed implicit trust, and one in whom he himself would not have hesitated to engage in any enterprise the requirements of which were courage and fidelity \u2014 stepped forward and spoke. \" Captain, I am sure my comrades know what I am about to say, and wish me to say it.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes !\" cried every voice. It had a strange effect amid the silence of the deep green forest to hear those voices all in unison. Any one who, from a distance, could have seen that party of persons beneath the greenwood tree, might well have fancied they were carrying out the ceremonies of some ancient mystic rite. Captain Heron inclined his head \" Speak, then, Number Two,\" he said. \" Speak to me freely.\" \" I will, Captain.\" There was a pause of a few moments' duration, and the band gathered closer around Heron and Daisy. \" Captain.\" added Number Two, \u2014 \" Captain, we have all heard a something of what has happened iu London. You are now a great, rich nobleman, and no longer can Lra expected to be our captain in old Epping Wood.\" Heron bowed his head in assent. \" This day,\" added Heron, \" we par', for ever !\" An exclamation from every lip, and then a deep stillness, accompanied by inquiring glances from every eye, succeeded. \" Well and faithfully,\" added Heron, \" have you all served me. You know that onr agreement was tbat in secret recesses of old Hinchcliffe Priory \u2014 here in the wood, and among the founda tions of which we have our most secret haunt \u2014 I was to keep, for the common good of all, that plunder which was fee common property of all.\" \" The Captain was entitled to a fourth of every thing,\" said a voice. \" Yes, my men \u2014 that was the agreement. Not that I coveted so much, but I had a special object in view. I thought that my happiness in life was compromised in discovering and substantiating my birthright, and for feat purpose a large sum of money seemed at one time to be required. It is required no longer. Accident has done more for me than gold, and I am now the acknowledged and declared Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" Well, Captain, we all know and feel that, and that it can't be helped ; but we have pretty well made up our minds what to do.\" \" What ? \u2014 what is your determination ?\" \" We mean to keep old Epping Forest warm for you, Captain.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" Just that we don't think much of counts, and kings, and all that sort of thing; and that we think it just possible you may be glad to come back here to your old comrades some of these days.\" Heron shcok his head. \" Well, Captain, it may not be \u2014 but then yon know it may ; so we have made up our minds, after laying our heads together on fee matter, to remain here a year and a day.\" \" A year and a day !\" echoed the band. As before, the noises rising so simultaneously to the expression of one sound, echoed strangely throngh the old forest Captain Heron held his band upon his brow for a few moments, in anxious thought \" A year and a day I\" he said. \" Oh, how many things may happen in a year and a day '\" \" Lots of things, Captain !\" \" Well, well ! my old and tried friends. It is not for me to say one word to you to change your purpose. How do you propose, however, to live during that time?\" \" In the old fashion, Captain.\" \" You will still continue on the road?\" The band looked at each other with surprise. \" Hence,\" added Heron, \" it has become neces sary feat I should take my leave of you.\" There was a movement, which looked almost like alarm, among them. \" Upon my undoubted acknowledgement as Earl of Whitcombe, the King was pleased to grant me a pardon in full for all that I had done as Captain Heron the highwayman ; bnt, comrades, a pardon to Captain Heron was to him but a mockery and a delusion, if not accompanied by a similar grace to his companions.\" The band looked at each other. \" Iu a short time,\" added Heron, \" I shall, no doubt, procure the King's signature to the neces sary document. Until then, I should advise that you either disperse yourselves, or keep in the most seoret recesses of the forest\" \"We will!\" It was evident that the band of Captain Heron, although they listened wife apparent interest and attention to the words he uttered, were one and all full of painful thoughts at fee description of their union with him. Again that strange chorus of voices rose up beneath the overshadowing canopy of the old trees, and again died away in whispering echoes in the dark recesses of the wood. They regarded each other in silence, and each seemed to wish that his neighbour wonld take upon himself to say something which was upper most in fee minds of all. \" Be it so !\" said Heron. \" In feat case you want no pardon \u2014 no protection ?\" \" None I \" said the voices again. \" Bravo !\" shouted Tom Ripon. \" Hurrah !\" cried Ogle. Captain Heron turned, first to Tom, and fees What that something was, Felix Heron soon found out, and it affected him deeply."], [31, "25 EDITn HERON. to Ogle. There was a look of sad_ess in his eyes. \" Ton, Tom,\" he said, \" and you, Ogle\u2014 yon wUl both leave me \u2014 you whem I thought ever to keep near me in the great world, to which I am now forced to belong?\" ** No, no, Captain I\u2014 no I\" cried Ogle. \" May my right hand refuse to aid me, and my eyes grow dim, if I ever leave you ! It was but the excitement of the moment tbat carried me away. I return with you, Captain, if you wil I let me, and I wUl remain ever near you.\" \" Gladly, Ogle\u2014 gladly I\" Tom Bipon placed both his hands over his face, and Heron could see tears tiiokUng through his fingers. \" What's amiss now, Tom ?\" ** I'm a wretch I\" \"A what?\" \" A wretch, Captain- I forgot yon \u2014 I forgot Daisy. I only wonder Daisy don't kick me, and No. 4. \u2014 Edith Hxron. then bite aU the hair off my head \u2014 that I do ; and now, I suppose, you won't let me be with you, Captain, at any price?\" Heron smiled. \" Not if you want to stay here, Tom.\" \" Bat I don't\" \" That alters the case. I fancy, however, that you wUl be happier here, in Epping Forest, than you can be with me in London.\" \" No, I shan't I\" \" Please yourself, Tom.\" \" And may I stay with yon, Captain?'1 \" As long as you please!\" \" Hurrah, then, again I Tom's aU right I I say, my men, you may look out for us \u2014 all three \u2014 back again some day ; for I'm quite sure \u2014 as sure as my name is Tom Ripon, though I ain't quite sure of that neither \u2014 tbat those sine, grand folks in London will do something to the Captain to make him wish himseU back in old Epping wood again ; and then you will see ns all.\""], [32, "EDITH HERON. 26 One of the band, who had been stationed as a scout some distance from the spot where the con ference of Heron wife his men had taken place, hooted thrice in imitation of au owl. That was fee well-known cry of caution. The band was silent, as though they had been so many statues. Captain Heron at that moment quite forgot that he was no longer the leader of the gang of desperate freebooters, and that he was no less a personage than the Earl .of Whitcombe. \" To your covers !\" he said\u2014\" to your covers, my men! We will soon discover wr-o these intruders on our old domain of Epping are.\" Captain Heron spoke these words so much in his old style as their leader, that fee band were de lighted ; and but that that would have been a very inopportune moment in which to do so, they would have raised a shout of satisfaction. As it was, they obeyed fee order in a moment, eo that, as if by magic, they disappeared front the forest glade. Some crawled among the brushwood. Seme hid themselves most scientifically among the gnarled roots of the old trees. Tom Ripon remained in the tree, whither he bad gone in search of his hat Captain Heron dived with Daisy down one of those narrow lanes, if tbey may be so termed, among the dense herbage, whioh, beyond a few paces, were completely lost to the casual observer. Ogle followed Heron and Daisy. Then the creaking sound of wheels came again en the still air. A large covered waggon appeared. This waggon was drawn by four Flemish horses of great size and strength ; and t_ey dragged on wards the hnge, ponderous waggon slowly and surely over the green- sward, on which fee wheels left a wide track. A couple o! lazy-looking men, in carters' frocks, were with the waggon. On reaching abont fee middle of that forest glade, one of the men, in a strongly marked country dialect, cried out, \" Woa ! woa ! Dang it i won't 'ee woa ? Drat thee ! thee art in a woundy hurry, Dobbin! Woa!\" The horses paused at this remonstrance. Captain Heron was rather critical, and he could not help thinking at that moment that there was a something that looked like acting about thc whole affair. The waggon \u2014 tbe horses \u2014 fee carters, with their capital costume \u2014 the marked country dialect in which they spoke, \u2014 all seemei to him to bo just a little overdone. And yet he could not take upon himself to say that he bad any precise reason for this opinion. It was rather, though, a shock to him when he found it was shared by Ogle. \" Captain,\" he whispered, \" I don't half like those fellows.\" Oapltin Heron sighed : he thought it was ex ceedingly likely the fine, grand folks, as Tom called them, would do something to make him wish himself back in Epping Forest again ; but he did not think that, as a necessary oonsequence, he should go back there. Taking from his pockets two bags, filled well with gold, he let them drop to the green tnrf, at fee feet of Daisy. \" Listen to me, all of you,\" he said. Since it is I who desert fee band, I do not think it right that I should take with me any of the profits of our life here in the wilds of Epping. In those two small bags you will find the full amount, as nearly as I can from recollection calculate it, that I have ever received as my share of our suc cesses.\" \"No, no!\" shouted the baud, with one voice. \"No, no, Captain : that is not fair !\" \" Let me do as I please,\" added Heron. \" Money now is plentiful wife me. I wish you to take it all back ; and Ogle will remain here in the wood for the remainder of the day, and joint out to you all the secret recesses among the old ruins, where I have hidden what was yours and my money, but which I now surrender entirely to you.\" The band murmured at this. They could not think it equitable that Captain Heron should thus give np all. But he was inflexible ; and those arrangements being made, he looked about him with saddened eyes. \" One word more,\" he then said. \" If any of yon get into any trouble, do not scruple to apply to me.\" \"Yes,\" said Tom Ripon; \"apply to us, and we will get you off, yon may depend.\" \"Silence, Tom \u2014 silence! I have one thing more to say, and I think only one. In this wood, as yon all know, there has resided, as long as we have known its deep recesses, an old, destitute woman.\" \" The maniac of the spring!\" '\u2022 Yes ; I allude to her.\" \" She is dead, Captain.\" \" Then I have no more to say. She at last is at peace ; and now, my gallant friends, farewell !\" Captain Heron held out his hand, and the band pressed round him to shake it. There were tears ! in every eye; and Tom Ripon, who had now , climbed into the tree where he had thrown his oap, made such an odd sound of weeping, that he startled everybody. \"Ogle,\" said Heron, \" you will remain here on the service I have mentioned, and at nightfall let me see you at Castleneau House.\" \" Yes, Captain.\" 11 There you go again!\" said Tom\u2014\" calling the Captain, Captain, when you know he is a lord, and not a Captain \u2014 ain't yon, Captain ?\" \" Call me what you will,\" said Heron, \" so that you all feel and know that I am your true friend.\" , ,. . , Heron turned Daisy's head in the direction from whence he had come, and was in the very act of raising his hand to bid the band adien, when a strange sound came upon his ear and those of the band in the foiest glade. It was the creaking sound of wheels, and the soft, yet palpable tread of horses' feet in the wood- It was eo rare a thing for any vehioles to at- tempt to pass through any of the forest glades, that these Bounds struck every one as paouliar. Captain Heron paused. Daisy pricked np her ears and shook her silken \" Nor I.\" \" I thonght you wonld not\" \" And yet Ogle, I know no good reason why they should not be just what they seem.\" \" Shall I sally out, Captair, and speak to them?\" \" No, no ! I think I will myself.\" Ogle smiled. Cap'ain Heron was completely oblivions of his new peerage. \" Yi u take charge of Daisy,\" added B<ron \" I will soon find ont who and what tbey are. \" The two waggoners had apparently stoppd the mane."], [33, "EDITH HERON 27 hortes and waggon, for the purpose of making a mid-day meal. From one of those little wooden boxes which are attached to the sides of waggons, and which are, in truth, fee larders of the waggoners, they ex tracted some huge lumps of fat baoon and brown bread, at which they commenced active operations, with their clasped knives, grinning and talking together in a broad country dialect as they ate. Oaptain Heron dismounted from Daisy, and Ogle took charge of the bridle. Then without attempting fee least concealment of himself, or of fee direction from whence he oame, Heron stepped out of fee leafy covert into the open award. \"Hilloa!\" he cried; \" what do you do here, my men ?\" \" Yes, Captain.\" Heron mounted Daisy again, and rode calmly out into the forest glade. He saw that the two waggoners eyed him with looks of Interest ; and there was another thing he noticed, which, trifling as it was, was yet full of meaning. The fat bacon and the bread, which they had seemed to be eating with such good appetites, did not seem to be in any great degree diminished in amount On the grass at their feet appeared, too, various portions of it; and if these portions had been picked np and added to what they still had in their hands, it seemed to Heron as if the whole quantity would be made up. If this were eo, the eating the fat bacon and the brown bread was all a sham. \"Anan!\" said one of the waggoners, with a stupid look. And if that were all a sham, the carters them selves were likely to be so. Heron gently drew one of the pistols from the holster of his saddle, and levelling it at the bunk of a tree, he fired. The report started fee carters. \" Missed !\" said Heron, \" missed ! I'm not mnch of a shot I dare say, though, I can hit the waggon.\" The waggoners dropped fee bacon and bread. \" Why, measter,\" said one, \" don't 'ee send a hole in our waggon till \" \" Come, now,\" added Heron, \" I'll lay you a wager, both of you.\" \"Yeas, measter \u2014 what be it?\" \" Yon shall make a mark on the waggon -cloth, on fee other tide to where I am, and I will send a bullet from this side right through, and hit it\" \" Noa, measter \u2014 noa !\" \"You won't'\" \" Do you speak to me, measter ?\" said fee other \" Yes ; I want to know what you are here for There is no road through the forest, and a good one alongside of it.\" \" That be true.\" \" Well, then, why do yon ran fee risk of losing your way in the wood ?\" \" We ain'i a going to lose nothin', measter. We comes arter fee bark.\" \"The what?\" \"The bark. We be Sir John Hinchinden's men, an' we comes to get a waggon-load o' bark off the old trees.\" Captain Heron knew perfectly well that during his residence in fee forest the trees had been \" barked \" by the Lord of the Manor several times, and there was nothing improbable in the story told by these men. \" How long will you be here ?\" he asked. \" Why, measter, we be a going to stay till fee sun gets out to-morrow.\" \"AU night?\" \"Yeas, measter.\" \"Why so? Why don't yoa take- your load of bark and go off at once ?\" \" It cooms off all the more kinlly, when the night dew be on the trees, measter \" \" And so you mean to sleep a night in Eppisg Forest? In your waggon, I suppose?\" \" Yeas, that be it\" \" Well, now, if yon are prudent men, I advise you to do no such thing\" \" Anan !\" \" It bean't our waggon, measter.\" \" Very well. You can't be blamed, you know, if I am wilful Here goes ! I shall send a bullet right through the waggon, and hit that little oak sapling there en the other side \" \" Noa ! \u2014 noa !\" \" Yes, I will. Here goes.\" There was a violent movement of the waggon cloth from some one inside it, and a loud voice yelled ont \" Don't ! don't ! \u2014 don't fire ! It's murder \u2014 it's wilful murder ! and, as the Ptalmtst says Dear me ! what does fee Psalmist say ? I'm off my memory, I'm in such a fright. Murder ! \u2014 murder ! Help ! Don't be rash \u2014 don't \u2014 don't !\" Oaptain Heron was evidently considerably sur prised to see, after a violent agitation of the canvass covering of fee waggon, the head of no other than the Rev. Mortificatioa Ripon emerge from it, with terror depicted upon every feature of his face. The waggoners both put on the same stupid look of non-comprehension, which they assumed at a moment's notice, as soon as they did not wish to agree with what Captain Heron said \"Please yonrself! please yourself!\" added Heron \" It don't matter to me. Good day.\" \" Good day, measter.\" Heron strolled with a careless air among the bushes again. CHAPTER X \" Ogle,\" he said, \" warn the band.\" \" Tuere is danger then, Captain ?\" \" There is. I don't exactly know what it is, but I have my suspicions I never yet saw a waggon, and the more especially one that had not yet taken ia its load, so completely fastened down.ao regards vne tarpanling, as that one.\" \" Ah ! Then you suspect, Captain \" \" That there is more than we at present know of in the wagg \u00ab__\" \" What, is to be done ?\" \" Get all tbe band out of the way.

Jonathan Wild would listen to no remon strances on the part of Warringdale; but having attired himself in a good portion of the costume of Baptael, the chemist, he likewiae borrowed \u2014 quite eo\u00e6pulsorily \u2014 Lord Warringdale's boots ; for Jonathan WUd had on rather a remarkable pair\u2014 thick and heavy enough in the sole to inflict serious injury by a hick. He thought ii very probable that he mi^hthavo beec recogniiied by itose brcUl-ljcsi _g boots."], [34, "28 EDITH HERON. jeering his two arms in rather a ludicrous, but at the same time inviting fashion, he said, with an insinuating smile, \" Ladies, will you allow me to accompany you to the door? The morning is raw, and really is one of those on which young people are very apt to take cold.\" At fee first glance, fee two old women had rather shrunk from Jonathan Wild, for his coun tenance was not engaging ; but his words fell with a mellifluous sound upon their ears. They each accepted the proffered arm ; and Jonathan Wild \u2014 amusing himself as he went by making the most hideous faces \u2014 emerged in this manner from fee Abbey, and found himBelf in the open air, cer tainly a free man as far a6 appearances went, but with, as he shrewdly suspected, a tolerably heavy price upon his head. \" Ladies,\" he said, \" I now leave you to make your own way to the happy homes, which no doubt with your charms you adorn. I nave the distinguished honour of bidding yon good morn ing.\" Wild darted 'across the way, and was soon out of sight in a number of intricate streets lying at the back of Whitehall. There was a narrow thoroughfare leading down to the river, and down that Wild took his way. He hired a boat at a little old stairs where wherries had plied for the last two hundred years. \" The Temple,\" said Wild. The boat pushed out into the stream, and then, dragging his hat far down over his brows, Wild gave himself up to thought The cogitations of the notorious thief-taker, and as notorious criminal, were something after the following fashion. \" I suppose, by this time, my house in Newgate Street has been thoroughly ransacked, so it won't do to go there. I shouldn't be at all surprised now if every one of my own janissaries and bull-dogs should be on the look-out to earn a handsome sum by laying a hand on my collar \u2014 of course, they'd be fools if they didn't. It's the way of fee world ! I'm down now, and there will be a thousand hands ready to keep me so. Things have turned out bad \u2014 very bad !\" Wild half muttered these disconnected thoughts, and then, suddenly looking up, he saw the eyes of the waterman fixed suspiciously on him. \" Well, my friend,\" he said ; \" do yon know me?\" Attired, however, in fee much thinner walking boots of Lord Warringdale, he felt confident no one would recognise him by his feet \" Disguise your feet and your head,\" said Wild, \" and who's to know you ? There's seven o'elook \u2014 good bye!\" \" Jonathan\u2014 Jonathan\u2014 promise me upon yonr sacred word that you will come back here as soon as possible,\" cried Lord Warringdale, in an im ploring voice. \" Don't ask me.\" \"Not ask yon?\" \"No\u2014 not in that fashion ; for yon tempt me to break my word if you do. I've already told you feat yon should see me back here again ; but if you put it to me as a matter of sacred word, I'm afraid fee temptation to break faith with you will be too strong to resist.\" Warringdale looked wan and haggard, but Jonathan Wild paid no more attention to him than if he had been a stick or a stone ; and making his way up fee narrow slippery staircase, he pushed aside the blue slaty-looking stone which covered fee vault, and emerged into fee chapel with the four kneeling figures. Wild knew perfectly well that the Abbey would be open for twenty minutes at that hour of the morning for early prayers ; and he knew \u2014 for he had had occasion to make himself acquainted with the fact once before \u2014 that a small congregation usually assembled in one of the dim and dusky aisles; so feat his presence, mingling himself with them, would excite no remark, and he would be able to leave the cathedral by the en trance at Poet's Corner wife perfect ease. The chemist's coat, in which Wild was en veloped, was a staid and sober-looking garment It buttoned up to the throat with a single row of buttons, and the skirts were long and wide. With feat and the boots of Lord Warringdale, Jonathan Wild looked almost respectable. The remarkable chapel, with the four kneeling figures supporting the monumental slab, was at a considerable distance from the place where the morning service was held, and Jonathan Wild had not traversed one-third of the distance before he was met by an indignant verger. \" Sir ! sir I Indeed you must not \u2014 you must not wander abont fee cathedral \u2014 yon must not, indeed, sir !\" Wild put on a sanctimonious look, and rolling his eyes in a hideous fashion, he replied, \" Yea, I have stumbled from the path, then. I was in contemplation, friend, and knew not whither my footsteps led me. Yea, I will follow thee.\" \" This way, sir \u2014 this way, if you please. You couldn't ever have been here before, or you'd have known the early morning service was held in tbe north aisle.\" \" Yes,\" said the man. \" Oh, yon do, do you? You know I'm Smith, and keep the umbrella shop at the corner of Northumbeiland Street, in tbe Strand?\" \" Oh, dear, no !\" \" Ah ! Then who am I ?\" The waterman laughed. \" I mightn't have known you in that coat and those boots, because you look ever so much slimmer than usual ; but sitting opposite to you now, and pulling down the river in this easy way, I see your face so well feat I know you're Jonathan Wild !\" \" Yea, I \" \"Hist! hush! It's begun \u2014 be quiet There! right on, and you'll see ihose two old women \u2014 that's the congregation.\" \"Humph!\" said Wild to himself; \"it seems I've very nearly been the congregation myself; but, however, these two old women and I make up a capital trio.\" The two old women were groaning and making some hideous sounds, which they seemed to think was part of the ceremony. The officiating clergy man was evidently cold, and wanted to get home to his breakfast ; but he did his duty, and the ser vice being over, the two old women faced about, and for fee first time saw Jonathan Wild. \" You are too clever by half ; and I suppose you are the man who wins all the swimming matches P\" \"The what?\" \" The swimming matches. Don't you hear me?\" \" I have you fast enough, Mr. Wild ; but yon must mistake me for some one else, for it so hap pens I can't swim a stroke, though I am a free waterman, and have been on the Thames a matter of sixteen years.\" Wild put on one of his blandest looks, and pro-"], [35, "29 EDITH HERON. i \" What do yon do when yen're swamped and upset then?\" \" I take care not to be swamped and upset ; for if I were, down I should go.\" \" Go now, then !\" said Wild. The wherry was frail and narrow, and as he spoke, Wild suddenly seized hold of one side of it, and as suddenly shifted his position to the other. The larboard gunwale dipped nnder the stream, the waterman abandoned his oars and raised a shout of alarm, and wherry and waterman were in a few seconds submerged by the rapidly slowing tide. Wild had saved his life more than once by swimming ; he was not now a hundred yards from the bank, and he soon landed on the half mud, half shingle, of the miserable little quay at fee end of Essex Street in fee Strand. \" Surely \u2014 surely,\" he muttered, \" it might be managed \u2014 with good professional assistance it might be managed ; and there resides a man in one of the sets of chambers up this staircase, who, if he would undertake the matter heartily and unscrupulously, with my assistance, must suc ceed.\" He paused for a moment; and then, looking up, there shone a gleaming lustre from his eyes. \" What a stake to play for !\" he said ; \u2014 \" the Earldom of Whitcombe and its vast estates! Sixty thousand pounds a-year at the very least \u2014 manors \u2014 parks \u2014 woods \u2014 properties of every kind and description! Havel \u2014 I, Jonathan Wild \u2014 thief-taker in ordinary and extraordinary, lived for this ? What a chance !\" Wild drew a long breath ; and then, stretching ont one arm, he clutched his fingers convulsively in tbe air, as though he saw the coronet and the ermined robes of the Whitcombes before him like Macbeth's air-drawn dagger, and could clutch them to his breast. The cold bath he had had was anything bnt pleasant, but it was better than a hue and cry after him, which might have ended in a second arrest, from which he might not have found it so easy to free himself. Close to the landing-place was a small, old fashioned public-house ; but they were primitive sort of people who kept it, and although it was then nearly eight o'clook, not a shutter was open, nor did there seem a soul stirring. Wild's toth chattered with cold, and he would fain have found relief from his discomforts in The reader will be at no loss to understand what has given rise to these wonderful and am bitious fancies on the part of Jonathan Wild. The reflections which crowded upon his ima gination must be read and construed by the light of that parchment document he had procured from the iron casket in the long neglected and forgotten vault of the Whitcombe family. Keeping in mind fee singular statement con tained in that parchment, it will not surprise fee reader to learn that to the scheming, intriguing brain of Jonathan Wild it seemed possible tbat he could personate the descendant of that junior branch of the Whitcombe family to which, if the statement of Eari Hugh de Mowbray was true, the title and estates must descend. some hot potation, but he felt the danger of recog nition \u2014 for like most notorious or celebrated per sonages, be paid tbe penalty of being rather too well known in his prosperity to hope to evade curious eyes in his adversity. Therefore, drippinglikeabalf-drowned rat\u2014 his apparel looking shiny and moist with the water of fee river \u2014 Jonathan was fain to make his way in silence and in solitude up a street \u2014 which even now only boasts of about one passenger in an hour, and at the period of which we write was less populous still. A half-formed plan was in Wild's imagination, shaping and rounding itself, so to speak, into con sistence. A chaotic confusion of bewildering images chased each other through his scheming brain ; but as minute succeeded minute, that which looked to him at first like some wild fancy. too doubtful and precarious ever to be carried out into practice, began to assume probability, form, and substance. Could anything be more strange, airy, and un substantial, at first sight, than the idea that by any combination of circumstances Jonathan Wild himself should become a competitor for the earldom and estates of Whitcombe ? And yet, so it was. As he sat upon that ancient staircase, drenched with Thames w\u00bb*~.r and shivering with cold, he seemed as if, iL the semi darkness of the place, he saw the glitter of the jewels that might adorn the coronet. Jonathan Wild was certainly an imaginative man. Wild made his way into the Temple down feat narrow court near the Strand end of Essex Street His eyes seemed fixed upon the pavement, and any one would have thought he was walking me chanically about the old courts and open spaces of fee Temple, rather than with a destination. But Wild knew where he was going \u2014 that Is to say, he had a vagne impression on his mind that it wonld be well to take the course he was about to take; and, finally, when he reached a dingy staircase, black with age and slanting with decay, he sat down in fee deep gloom of the old wooden steps, and, resting his head upon his hands, he reflected as deeply as ever he had reflected in all his life. He was a bold one, too ; for certainly the cha racter of the opposition he wonld be likely to en counter upon putting forth any such intentions might well have appalled him. Was he not likewise a criminal ? \u2014 a man but recently escaped from Newgate ? \u2014 a man against whom all the powers of the law would be ar rayed? And yet he dared to dream of achieving, by some chicanery and villany, an earldom and sixty thonsand a year ! A cold shudder came over him, for, as he looked into the half- darkness about him, the brilliant vision of the coronet and the peer's robes appeared to vanish, and he saw a shouting, hooting mob; while, rising above the heads of the furious mass of people, was that angular wooden erection he had himself looked on so often with complacency. The gibbet ! Wild thook in every limb. He felt himself getting ill. Want of rest \u2014 a fearful fall he had bad at Newgate \u2014 the immersion in fee Thames, \u2014 all began to tell upon him. He rose, and, with a staggering gait, ascended farther up tbe staircase. Twice he felt in an inner pocket of his vest, to He forgot fee chilling sensations consequent npon his immersion in the river. He forgot that the water was still dripping from his clothes , he forgot the fatigues he had gone through the pre ceding night \u2014 the bruises and hurts he had re ceived in his escape from Newgate ; and he forgot to reflect that even his own constitution must have a limit to its powers of endurance. Jonathan Wild's imagination was running riot in a dream of the future."], [36, "EDITH HERON 30 Jonathan Wild had fallen, he had gone, in imagi nation, through all the horrors of an execution. Mr. Boom made him no answer, but presented the bottle. Wild put it to his lips, and took a deep draught Gradually his ordinary complexion came back to him, and in a few minutes he was very much himself again. \"Now, Mr. Wild,\" said Boom, sarcastically, \" perhaps you will do me fee honour of explain ing this visit\" \" That's fee word,\" said Wild. \" What word ?\" \" Honour ! It is an honour, this visit Look on me, Sharkus Boo.ii ; and when you do, you be hold the Right Honourable fee Earl of Whit combe.\" be certain that he had the parchment document secure. It felt cold, but dry- The Thames water, then, had not reached it, and Wild tried to laugh. He was too ill and sick. Passing several doors which opened from the gloomy corridors of that old house, he at length paused at one ; and after clasping his hands over his eyes several times \u2014 for fee letters on that door seemed to dance in wild confusion before him \u2014 he succeeded in fixing and reading the name. Mr. Boom. Wild knocked at the door. There was no reply, and he leant heavily against the door. He strove to kick at it, think ing he would produce fee same effects he usually did with his heavy boets; for he forgot at the moment he had exchanged them with Lord War ringdale. \" Mad !\" said Boom. \" No\u2014 perfectly sane. Read this.\" Jonathan Wild produced the psrohment he had taken from the ir\u00abn casket, and he watched at tentively fee countenance of Mr. Boom as he read it Then their eyes met, and Boom spoke. \" This is exceedingly interesting,\" he said, \" to the younger branch of fee Whitcombe family.\" \" Exceedingly.\" \" And, with further aid from documentary evi dence, would go far to place the representative of that younger branch in a very enviable position.\" \" Very,\" said Wild. \" But how came yon by this parchment ? And what do you mean to do with it ?\" \" It came to me,\" said Wild, \" by a very mys terious dispensation ; and what I mean to do w ith it is to use it for the purpose of substantiating my rights. Perhaps there will be found some old tombstone, with names and dates upon it \u2014 perhaps a few letters and family memorials may be forthcoming \u2014 so that, with the assistance of Mr Boom, attorney -at- law (we shall share with him, mind \u2014 share with him the princely re venue), Jonathan Wild will be acknowledged as the living representative of that younger branch, and Earl of Wniccombe. You see it all now ?\" Then he knocked again, and fee door was opened. Jonathan Wild staggered into the apartment which presented itself ; and as he did eo, the man who had opened it retreated before him, until, by a sidelong movement, he had placed a table be tween himself and his visitor. Jonathan Wild was brought to a standstill by that table, and he leant heavily npon it, as he looked the occupant of the chambers in the face. Then, summoning all his remaining strength, and throwing it into his voice, he yelled out, \" If you want thirty thousand a-year, take care of me!\" Jonathan Wild then reeled back, and fell like a ston e to the floor. Mr. Boom was astonished, perplexed, bewil dered- He knew his visitor very well; but he had believed him to be lying in Newgate, with almost a certainty of the gallows in prospect Ho w had he escaped ? And what did he want there with him ? What could he mean by talking of thirty thousand a-year ? These were questions whioh Mr. Boom, attor ney-atlaw, asked himself with rapidity; but, being a prudent man he did not seek to obtain answers to them by making an outcry, and taking the whole house, and perhaps fee whole Temple, into hia confidence. \" I think I do,\" said Boom, faintly. \" Let me think.\" On the contrary, Mr. Boom went to the outer door of his obambers, and closed it. After affix ing, by the aid of a wafer, a small paper upon it, with the words, \" Retnrn in an hour,\" he was sn a situation to pay exclusive attention to his illustrious visitor. CHAPTER XI. CAPTAIN HERON FINDS HIS PRESENCE AND EX- PERIENCE OF IMPORTANCE IN EPPING FOREST. Mr. Boom was a tall, wiry-looking man \u2014 some fifty years of age, or perhaps more. There was a look of keenness about his eyes, but it wa_s that of fee vulture, not of the eagle. From one of those mysterious tin boxes which in lawyers' chambers are supposed to contain the title-deeds of estates and important family docu ments, Mr. Boom drew forth what was then mu:h more to the purpose\u2014 namely, a bottle. Jonathan Wild's eyes were closed, but fortu nately his mouth was a little way open. \" Choke, or recover,\" said Mr. Boom, as he tilted some brandy from the bottle into Wild's mouth Jonathan kicked and plunged. He turned red in the face. He kicked aud plunged still more. He turned black in the face \" Ah!\" said Boom; \" I fancy he's done for.\" Jonathan Wild uttered a yell, and sat np. \" No,\" said Boom, \" he's all right now \" \" Where am I ?\" said Wild. \" I never heard of such a ca?e before. Are you a doctor ? DM the rop*- br. xk \u2014 or what ? ' During those few moments of trance into which The surprise of Felix Heron at the sight of the Reverend Mortification Ripon, when that indivi dual looked out from beneath the canvass cover ing of tbe suspicious waggon that had found its way to the forest, was great Probably, fee Reverend Mortification was to the full as much astonished at the presence of the new Earl of Whitcombe beneath the le Jy cano pies of Epping, as he, Heron, was at sight of his old acquaintance. Heron presented the pistol full at the head of the Reverend Mortification. \" Tell me, rascal !\" he said\u2014\" tell me at once \u2014 and be sure that it is the truth you utter \u2014 v. hat brin g* you here ?.\" \u2022' The waggon\u2014 the waggon !\" cried the Rjve rend Mortification. \" The waggon, as I am a Christian ! \" \"Your purpose ?\" \" Pur\u2014 pose ?

Get thee be hind me, miniature Satan I Yea, I will not speak to thee !\" Heron paused for a moment, in thought ; and then glancing towards the head of fee waggon, he saw that, in attitudes which almost prevented him from seeing them, the two waggoners were hastily endeavouring to leave fee spot That sight decided Heron at once what to do. \" You may call it what you like. To my feel ings and sensations, it is justice.\" Captain Heron pretended to hold the pistol in such a manner, just beneath one of his eyes, that he seemed to be taking an accurate aim at the face of the Reverend Mortification Ripon, who yelled out in a voice of the most dolorous entreaty, \" Oh, don't don't ! Have mercy upon me, and spare my wretched life, and I will tell all !\" That was the frame of mind to which Captain Heron wished to bring the Reverend Mortification. \" Quick \u2014 quick !\" he cried; \" or you will be too late!\" \" No\u2014 no ! Don't say feat, my dear sir ! \u2014 I mean my dear Captain ! No, I mean my dear Lord Whitcombe\u2014 for, yea, I have heard feat you are a lord now 1\" \" Quick, I say ! What is your object here in Epping Forest, in that waggon ?\" \"Hem! Yea \u2014 I\u2014 a \u2014 I \u2014 hem! I was a cap tive \u2014 yea, a captive to the bow and the spear of Jonathan Wild ; bnt when that individual was himself placed in the hands of the Philistines, the house in Newgate Street, that he named Little Newgate, was visited by the Bow Street officers, and a messenger from the Home Office ; and, yea, I was liberated i Yea, that is all, as the Psalmist says ; and when you have told all, as the verse of Sternhold and Hopkins expresses it \u2014 He raised the cry of the owl. \" Hoot ! hoot ! hoot !\" Three times did that cry resound through the forest, and then, before the echoes died away, from fee various hiding places whither his men had re tired on his advice, the band issued forth. Hardly, however, had the foremost of them reached fee waggons, when the canvass covering of it was thrown off, and, to the surprise of Heron, there appeared within it at least twenty well armed men, whom, at a glance, he recognised as officers of the police. \"Surrender!\" cried a loud voice ; \"surrender! or your blood be upon your own heads !\" The band of Captain Heron raised a shout of defiance. The officers answered it by a loud \" Hurrah !\" Almost every officer in the waggon was armed with a banger and a pair of pistole. Such a for midable attack had never yet been made npon the baud of Captain Heron in old Epping Forest. The robbers retreated to the skirt of the beauti ful glade in which these proceedings were taking place ; and then tbe officer who was in command of the party in the waggon called out, \" We lire upon the first scran who tries to leave the spot !\" \" No !\" said Heron, as he dashed forward and placed himself and Daisy between his band \u2022 u the waggon. \"No; there need be no firing. Who are yon, and what would yon in Epping wood ?\" \" My name is Chesterton, my Lord Whitcombe,\" replied the principal officer. \" We know that you are now the Earl of Whitcombe, and that you have the King's free pardon, and yon ought to help. ns to take these fellows.\" \" ' Wtien the brimstone Doileth up, And sinners all do roar, The pleased suspense is past and gone \u2014 'Tis uaelesa to say more.' \" \" Yon scoundrel !\" said Captain Heron. \" Yon have not told me yet what yon want here ?\" \" Yea ! I\u2014 a\u2014 hem ! Nothing !\" \"Tom! Tom!\" \u25a0 Here you are, Captain !\" Tom Ripon let himself drop from the tree in which he Was perched close to the waggon. \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" there is that small imp of the evil one ! Yea, there is the brand !\" \" Don't you be a calling me names !\" said Tom. \" I won't stand it, though you are a sort of father in-law. How is fee old gal, eh ?\" \"The who?\" \" Can you think me so base ?\" \" Oh, my lord, its very right and proper that highwaymen should be taken !\" replied the officer; sarcastically. There was a flush of anger on the face of Heron, and moving his arm, he said \" Fellow ! yon have acknowledged that you know I am a peer of the realm, and therefore my word should be to you a thing not to be trifled with. I make myself an swerable for afl these men.\" \"The old gal!\" \"Yea, it is fee old gentleman with whom you will in good time be acquainted.\" \" Tom,\" said Heron, \" I will not shoot that man 1\" \" That wgl\\ do, my lord.\" \" It must do, and it shall do !\" The officers looked at each other, and nodded \" No, Captain !\" \" Yea, I am sa \u2014 ved !\" \" Silence ! But I condemn him to death ! Let him be hanged on one of fee trees !\" \" Yes, Captain.\" The Reverend Mortification uttered a howl of dismay. \" I will tell all\u2014 yea, I will f-U all ! The Phi listines in fee red waistcoats, from Bow Street, they said unto me, ' Yea,' says they, ' will yon go to Epping Forest, in a waggon,' says they, ' in order,' says they, 'to find out all fee secret plans of Captain Heron's band ? For, yea,' says they, ' he is a lord now, and he is not wife them, and they are ripe for Tyburn ; and yea, there will be forty pounds each for as many of them as are hanged ; and yea, yon shall have a share of it !' \" their heads, and then Chesterton said firmly, \" N<v my lord, it won't do. We are here, and we must do our duty.\" \"Nay, hear me out. I have no doubt in the world but that the moment I get an interview with the King, which, as a peer of the realm, I know I can demand, I shall procure his Majesty's pardon for all my followers. Till then I give my word that they shall not leave Epping Forest.\" \"Captain,\" said one of the band, \" don't^yom trouble about us. Tbey have not got us yet !\" \" Peace !\u2014 peace !\" said Heron. \" I would fain that this matter was settl ad without bloodshed.\" \" And so would we, my lord,\" said Ch- sterton,"], [38, "32 t \u25a0sa EDITH HERON. the chief officer. \" But bloodshed or not blood shed, we must do our duty !\" \" Your duty will be as well done in fee way I suggest, as by violence.\" \" No, my lord, no ! We are the stronger party, and it is not in nature and reason tbat we should give in to fee weaker. We will take these men to London, and lodge them all in Giltspur Street Compter. Then, if your lordship can get the royal pardon for them, out they will all walk.\" Captain Heron gave one glance at his men. They thought it was a glance of inquiry as to whether they would submit to such terms or not With one voice, they raised a ebont of defiance. \" No, no ! Never yield \u2014 never !\" Chesterton, the officer, turned pale. The moment for action had come. \" Clear away, my lord,\" he said. \" We have nothing to say to you now, whatever we might have had to say last week.\" There was something so insulting in tbe tone in which these words were uttered, that the com mand which Heron had kept upon his temper up to this moment gave way. As he neared the scene of action, he became, with Daisy, enveloped in clouds of white smoke. The unmistakable odour of gunpowder was about that white vapour. And yet Captain Heron conld form no conjec ture as to fee real cause of the explosion that had taken place, although now he felt that gunpowder must have been fee agent in the disturbance. When at length he fairly emerged from among the trees into the forest glade, a very singular scene presented itself to him. Immense olouds of white vapour were clearing off before the wind, and in a few seconds more fee atmosphere was pure enough. Scattered over fee green-sward were fee relics of the waggon. Here a wheel \u2014 there a bit of a shaft\u2014 elsewhere a torn, blackened yard or two of the canvass covering ; and amid the ruins were seated a number of dolorous-looking persons, with singu lar-looking, blackened faces, some of whom, too, had their hair and whiskers singed and their clothing torn. The horses which had drawn the waggon had totally disappeared. A slight touch at the bridle of Daisy made her give one of those leaps at which she was famous, and the right hand of Heron was on the collar of the officer. When the vehicle went to pieces, they \u2014 finding fee traces broken, and that they were free to do so\u2014 set off through the wood, and were soon lost amid the abundant and beautiful foliage. Ranged along the side of the glade opposite to that which he, Heron, was. he saw the band, that a short time since had seemed to be in such peril. They were masters of the field, evidently, and had the command of the situation. Captain Heron galloped np to the spot where this singular disaster had occurred, and as he did so, he heard a voice in the most doleful accents call out, \"We give in \u2014 we give in I That's enough ! we give in !\" The accents were those of Chesterton, the offi cer; and after a good look about him, Captain Heron perceived that formerly over-confident per sonage sitting on one of the wheels of the waggon \u2014 the late waggon, we may call it \u2014 with a very black face, and half the hair singed off his head \" We give in I\" he added. \" You needn't go any further, my lord.\" \"What has happened?\" asktd Heron. \" Oh, you ought to know.\" \" I ? By heaven, 1 do not !\" \"Oh! ohl oh!\" Chesterton had just time to fire his pistol ; and the bullet had very nearly made a vacancy in the peerage, for it whistled past Heron's eyes. The band made a rush forward, with a shout of gratification. Several pistols were discharged from the officers in the waggon, and then Captain Heron was never so completely astounded in all his life at what happened. There was a roaring sound, and then a con cas.ion like a clap of thunder. A volume of white smoke rose up, as if from out of the earth, and the waggon, with its whole freight of officers, seemed to be visibly lifted up by some powerful and unseen agency, bnt to be let down again with a orash that sent it all to pieces. Daisy was so terrified that she took but one leap through the dense white smoke, and right over the wreck of the waggon ; and, in spite of Heron's attempts to stop her, she dashed across the forest glade with him, nor pansed until she was a good half -mile from the point of alarm. What had happened ? What could it be? Heron did not piuse to argue fee point with Chesterton, bnt he galloped up to his men, calling ont as he neared tbem, \" Whe can give me seme explanation of this strange occurrence?\" \"None of us, Captain,\" said they, with one voice, \u2014 \" none of us We have asked each other, and we cannot at all make it out \" If England had been a country in which earth quakes were among the phenomena of nature, Captain Heron would have said at once that this was one. But that was by far too wild a supposition to entertain for a moment. Nor did Heron lose time in usel___ conjecture. He turned Daisy's head once again towards the forest glade ; and having \u2014 by various pattings on fee neck, and snch expressions as she was used to \u2014 dissipated the alarm which had taken po-ses sion of the gallant creature, he made his way, beneath the trees and through the underwood, as quickly as he could back to the spot where the catastrophe \u2014 whatever had been its cause \u2014 had taken place. Three ringing cheers came upon tbe forest air. \" Nor I \u2014 nor I ! Is any one hurt?\" \" None of us, Captain.\" \" Hold Daisy a moment.\" Heron hastily dismounted, and walked towards the officers, who by this time were slowly gather ing themselves up, and looking very ruefully at each other. They were all alive ; and, indeed, be yond a good shaking and being half smothered with smoke, and looking very black and grimy, as if they had been on some chimney-sweeping expe dition, they were not much the worse for tbe affair, whatever may have been its cause. But all spirit was taken ont of them, and they no longer seemed to feel tbe least desire to cap ture Captain Heron's band of freebooters. Chesterton looked savage now, and he threw a keen glance at Heron, as he said, \" Well, my lord, Then the whooping, in imitation of the owl, let Captain Heron feel certain those cheers had eome from his own men, and that consequently, whatever had happened, they were fee victorious party."], [39, "EDITH HERON. 33 this will have to be accounted for ; and it ought, il it won't!\" polite, and which Heron would not condescend to pretend to hear, the officer departed, followed by his discomfited and wretched- looking companions. The forest band uttered another cheer. \" I know nothing whatever,\" said Heron, \" in regard to what has happened. The whole affair is a mystery to me \u2014 perhaps a greater one than it is to you ; for yon may have some idea concern ing it, while I have none.\" \" Very good, my lord \u2014 very good I All we have to do is to get back to London, and make onr report\" \" Please yourselves ; but at the same time re member, that the men who were once under my command have in no way assailed you.\" \"I don't know, my lord,\" said Chesterton, \"that, after all, we could not take our own part.\" \"Try it, then!\" Chesterton glanced at his followers, and the woe-begone, dilapidated looks that met him, soon let him see how idle was the boast he had uttered. Muttering some imprecations, more forcible than No. 5. \u2014 Edith Heron. Then, as long as the officers remained in sight, their ears were sainted by the whooping tones of Heron's men, until they might have thought them selves pursued by legions of mocking owls. The Reverend Mortification Ripon had, in some mysterious way, completely disappeared. He was certainly not among the officers when in so crest fallen a fashion they left the forest glade to the possession of fee band. Heron now turned to his men, and spoke in a voice that had some touch of sadness in it. \" I am sorry all this has happened,\" he said ; \" but it eannot be helped now. Keep yourselves close, and in the course of a week from now you shall see me again beneath the leafy canopies of old Epping.\""], [40, "34 EDITH HKE0N. The band cbeer-d him vociferously. \"Too much noise! too much noise!\" said Heron, as he waved his arm. \" Where is Ogle ?\" \" Here, Captain.\" \" And Tom Ripon ?\" \" Here I am, Captain.\" Tom appeared, but his face was as black as any of the officers' had been, and but a very small por tion of that hair was left upon his head which Daisy had so often amused herself by tugging at with her teeth. Moreover, the last thread of life belonging to Sir Dominick Browne was being slowly spun out The repose and quietude of Castleneau House was more fitting for his residence than the fashionable and courtly bustle of fee splendid mansion of the Earls of Whitcombe. Such, then, is fee state of our principal person ages after fee three weeks had elapsed which we have mentioned. Never did a day pass over during which E dilh did not pay a grateful visit at Castleneau House ; and, indeed, fee only carriage feat was ever wail ing in the court-yard of tbat old mansion, be longed either to the Countess of Whitcombe or to the E_il and Countess of Bridgewater. Of course, long ere this time, the news of Jonathan Wild's escape from Newgate had been in every one's mouth. But he had mysteriously disappeared So had Lord Warringdale. Not a living soul seemed to have the slightest idea of what had bee .me of these two persons, so long associated together in villany, and now that all their nefarious schemes had failed, ap parently lost to the world, either in some retreat from which they felt it would be hazardous to venture, or in the grave. How many people shall we say were there in existence who envied \u2014 deeply envied \u2014 the ap parent felicity of the great aud powerful Earl of Whitcombe ? The suspicion at once came across the mind of Heron that Tom Ripon had more to do with the explosion which had disturbed fee economy of fee waggon than any one else. Heron looked at him fixedly, and Tom Ripon then pretended to be watching a crow as it winged its flight over the old tree-tops. \" Tom !\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Explain ! How did you Wow up the waggon and the officers?\" \"Me, Captain? Me, do youmean ? Why\u2014 I \u2014a\u2014 oh, dear me ! it was all along o' the old gal, my mother.\" \" Yonr mother 1 How could she have any thing to do with it Tom?\" \" Why, you see, Captain, she took np with the Reverend Mortification, and so he was a kind o' father-in-law \u2014 and I can't abide fathers-in-law ; and so when he looked out of the waggon, I all of a sudden remembered the hollow oak tree over yonder, where a small keg of gunpowder has beeu kept by our fellows for ever so long; and when nobody was a-lookiDg what I did \u2014 I \u2014 1 \u2014 I think I must have rolled it under the waggon \" \" It is all explained,\" said Heron. \" I'm glad bf that!\" cried Tom. \" But, Tom, it was a hazard *us thing to do, for you might have sacrificed yonr own life as well as that of many others.\" \" That's all explained,\" s*id Tom. \" Bravo 1 Bravo, Tom Ripon !\" said the band. \" My men,\" said Tom, \" you may always de pend on me. I've been blown up a good many times by all sorts of people, but now I'm even with the world, so far as that goes- Good bye. When you want to be taken care of, send for me, and I'll do it All's right, CapUin ; it's all ex plained.\" So far as outside show went, did he not appear to be in possession of every element of happiness which Providence could bestow upon one of its most favoured children ? An ancient title. Wealth sufficient for every possible want, or even possible extravagance of the most vivid imagination. His Eiith \u2014 fee choice of his heart \u2014 now his own in the face Of all the world, without danger, and without the possibility of any interference to the even tenour of their affection. And yet the new Earl of Whitcombe was not happy. Three weeks had sufficed him tonajake the dis \u2022 covery that if every disposition of life wings with it its peculiar pleasures and delights, it like wise brings with it its peculiar eares and anxieties. Thrice had the Earl of Whitcombe respectfully requested an audience of the King for the purpose of soliciting his pardon for his companions in the forest, and thrice had that audience been refused. CHAPTER XII. Perhaps refused is rather too strong a term to use, inasmuch as the rauk of F=lix Heron, as a peer of the realm, entitled him to such inter view, almost on demand; but on one frivoloui pretext and another, it had certainly been evaded. THE EARL OF WHITCOMBE FINDS HIMSEL? IN SOME DISGRACE AT COURT. Step with us, reader, over a space of time which has comprehended the lapse of three weeks. The murdered Earl of Whit:ombe had been consigned to the tomb with all fee honours and ceremonies incidental to his rank Something mu6t have happened to turn the countenance of the monarch from him ; for no thing could very well be more gracious than the manner in which he had been first acknowledged as the undoubted Etrl of Whitcombe. Felix Heron, the new Earl, and his Countess, Elith, had taken what seemed to be a permanent possession of Whitcombe House- In vain had Edita endeavoured to persuade Lady Castleneau to quit the solitude of her old stately mansion in Bloomsbury, and take np her abode wife them in St James's- street; but the ancient gentlewoman clung to her old habitation, where, as she told Edith, there were memories of the past which prevented it ever becoming a soli \u2022 tude to ber, since it was peopled with recollec- Then, again, there is another source of gnawing anxiety in the heart of Heron- He had had lei_ure to make the most careful inquiries in and about the deserted asylum at E in. Sheen; and although the report that Amelu Staunton had died was confirmed by an under keeper whom he had ferreted ont, yet, if such were really the fast, she must have been interred somewhere, and some record of her burial would tions. surely be found."], [41, "EDITH HERON, 35 It wwuld have been a melancholy satisfaction to have been able to visit the grave of feat poor mother who had suffered so much, and met wife no reward \u2014 at least, in this world. But all the power, all the influence, and all the lavish expenditure of the Earl of Whitcombe, availed him nothing. He corjd come to no conclusion but that if his mother had really died in the asylum, her remains had been secretly consigned to the earth without the slightestform or ceremony, or actually cenveyed away to some remote distance, for fee express pur pose of baffling inquiry. But time might assuage these sorrows ; and the brave and gallant Captain Heron, iu his new state ol d'gnitv of Earl of Whitcombe, might have yet found sufficient happiness by looking into his own heart, but tbat fate was still adverse to that noble spirit, and the trials of existence, the battle of life, was not j et for him over. The joy-bells of many a church in London rang out merry pe.ls. It was the birth- day of the monarch. A Court ball of unexampled splendour was to be held that night at St James's ; and, of course, persons of such high rank as the Earl and Countess of Whitcombe would be sure to be present gained and lost by the vast change that bad taken place in his social position. Edith was present, likewise, in that drawing room \u2014 for the time was within half an hour of that at which they would start for fee Palace. And our fair Edith looked every inch a Coun tess, lending more grace and beauty to the splendid robes that enveloped her than they could ever im part to one eo peerless in face and form. Three other persons likewise might have been seen in this apartment of Whitcombe House. Lady Chester, the Countess of Bridgewater, and fee Earl of that name. It was something strange that amid the whole of the nobility of England the new Earl of Whit combe had scarcely made a passing acquaintance. But the open-hearted, gallant young Earl of Bridgewater clung to him with fee same earnest ness of friendship tbat he had bestowed when fee fortunes of Felix Heron were donbtful and pre carious. There was upon the face, however, of fee yonng Earl a look of uneasiness ; and when fee twilight deepened a little, and perhaps any unusual flush ing of his features or agitation of his brow might not be so clearly noticed, he turned to Heron and spoke. \"My dear Whitcombe,\" he said, \" are you above taking a piece ol advice from me this night?\" \"Never! What counsels can be better than those that come from the heart ? Speak, Bridge water, and speak freely. I have not failed to notice tbat for some days past something has seemed to be heavy at your heart\" \"It is a truth.\" The time is eight o'clock in tte evening. Tbe scene to which we would introduce the reader is one of the dratving- rooms of Whitcombe House. The mansion had been magnificently re-furnished and re-decorated by order ef the Earl and Coun tess. The drawing-room we have mentioned was a marvel of beauty. Five tall windows looked into St. James's Street, and sufficient light yet lingered in the evening to make artificial illumination in the apartment unnecessary \u2014 unless something more than conversation was proceeding. The persons present are tbe Earl himself, attired in a Court dress of the most magnificent description- A brilliant star sparkled on his breast; and Felix Heron certainly presented a noble appearance as he leant carelessly upon the marble chimney-piece cf that splendid apartment It was well known that the late Ear! tad died possessed of many orders of knighthood, and that every honour of that description which could be heaped upon him, during two reigns, he had possessed. Felix Heron had returned the insignia of these oideis to the King ; but he had been compelled to do so through the means of fee Lord Chamberlain. That itself was an unusual occurrence, and showed that there was some feeling against him on tbe mind of his M. jesty. Some of these insignia of knighthood nnder ordinary circumstances would have been grace fully presented to the new Earl. But such was not the case ; and there stood Felix Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, attired for this Court hall, and perhaps the only nobleman of his rank who would appear at it destitute of the snper ade'ed honours of some of those chivalric orders so highly esteemed by our English nobility. The Earl was pale \u2014 much paler than he had ever been while a free denizen of Epping Forest. The air of the city had robbed him of the healthful plow which was wont to mantle on his cheeks, and altogether fee youthful aspect of Felix Heron seemed fading away. At times a scornful look would light up his eyes, and a proud curl of fee lip would show that the mind within was busy taking note of what it had \" Then let us have it. Had I been certain feat it concerned me, I should long ere this have asked you for fee revelation ; but I shrunk from making a iemark about a certain air of sadness you wore, lest I should be inquisitively prying into matters my friend wished to keep to himself.\" \" No, Whitcombe \u2014 no. But now that you are going to the Court ball, and will encounter the circle immediately around the King, and probably the King himself, I ought to tell you there are ugly rumours.\" \" Ugly rumours !\" smiled Heron. \" Well, Bridge water, rumours are generally ugly ; for I never heard of anything whispered from mouth to mouth as rumour \u2014 which men were afraid or ashamed to speak of aloud \u2014 but it came from some ugly heart or ugly imagination, and was meant in mischief.\" \" 1 am fain to agree with jon, Whitcombe.\" \"But what rumours,\" asked Edith, as she passsed her arm within that of Felix Heron \u2014 \" but what rumours can affect us now ? Have we not passed through many storms and trials to reach this haven of safety at last ? A; e there people who really grudge us fee smooth water in which the bark of our happiness now sails?\" Heron looked kindly into the face of Edith, and fee cloud of care which had gathered on his brow was scattered in a moment \" Speak freely, Bridgewater,\" he said, \"and let us hear what the world says of us.\" \" Celonel Trelawney \" began the Earl of Bridgewater. \" A perfect gentleman,\" interrupted Heron. \" I am quite sure that no ugly rumours come from him.\" \" No ; but be called upon me some days since to say that a certain person had held a conversation with him which betrayed a strong feeling of dis trust against you, Whitcombe, upon two points.\" \" What were they ?\" <r"], [42, "36 EDITH HERON, \" First, it was that unfortunate journey of yours to Epping Forest fee whole events of which you have detailed to me ; but which, no doubt wi'h every possible exaggeration, had been repeated to fee certain person.\" \" The certain person, I presume, is fee King ?\" eaid Edith. bravery and show ; and we must confess we are at a loss to conceive why beauty of design in a car riage, or elegance of adornment, should be voted vulgar, unless it be by those persons who have not the taste to appreciate either. When the great, the noble, and tbe rich spent their money freely in brightness, blazoning, and beauty among the people, surely it was better for those beneath them than the present practice of a mean Quaker-like simplicity at home, while thousands are squandered at a foreign gaming table. \" Well, Countess, we are very much alone here, and I may say yes \u2014 the certain person is the Kirg; although at Court we have a habit of always mentioning him in this manner.\" \" Well,\" said Heron, \" and what else had fee certain person to say against me ?\" \" Simply that he is of opinion, after all, that there is some mistake, and you are not the real Earl of Whitcombe.\" The state carriage, then, of fee Earl of Whit combe was a thing of beauty, and had cost an im mense sum \u2014 not to the poor and needy, bnt to the rich man who could well afford it; and every ounce of silver in the trappings of the horses \u2014 every grain of gilding upon fee costly equipage \u2014 had certainly been a benefit to persons who re ceived tbe wages of that magnificence The distance the carriage had to traverse was so short, that it fell into the rank of fee long line of vehicles proceeding to the Court ball, down St James's Street, in a few seconds after its departure from the door of Whitcombe House. \" Indeed ?\" \" Just so \u2014 that is the royal impression \u2014 but how it has arisen I cannot imagine ; nor conld Colonel Trelawney \u2014 although, with a feeling in your interests, he got as much as he could from a certain person \u2014 gather anything upon the sub ject\" \" This is strange,\" said Heron ; \" but, perhaps, I ought not to think it so, since he who called him self Lord Warringdale still lives.\" Edith shuddered at the pronounciation of feat name. London was at that period lit by oil lamps, and there happened to be one opposite to the door of ihe next mansion to that which waB the property of the Earl of Whitcombe. \" Nay, dear one,\" said Heron, \" there is nothing to fear. The King can make an earl, but he cannot un-make one ; and one would imagine that even a royal imagination would be set at rest, after my own father had passed half a day in the royal cabinet, and explained every circum stance connected wife my life and history. Oh, that that father were still alive, to take from my shonlders the weight of this title and cumbrous state. We want it not, Edith.\" It was the merest accident in fee world that Felix Heron happened to glance out at tho car riage window ; but tbe moment he did so, he grasped the hand of Edith, as an instinctive sense of danger came over him, for exactly beneath the lamp he saw a face he knew only too well It was the face of Jonathan Wild ! \" Hold !\" cried Heron, as he pulled fee. silken check-string, and then opening the door of the carriage himself, he sprung out and tore his sword from its sheath, as he cried aloud, \" Arrest that man I \u2014 arrest that man ! It is the notorious Jona than Wild I The villain hasreoently escaped from Newgate! Arrest him ! arrest him!\" There was a rush of people and great confusion at the moment \u2014 for, owing to the stoppage of the Earl of Whitcombe's carriage, the whole line of vehicles had been brought to a standstill. But Jonathan Wild had disappeared as if by magic. Felix Heron retnrned to fee carriage wife a flush upon his face. \" I saw the villain, Edith,\" he said,\u2014\" I saw fee villain ! As plainly as my eyes ever looked npon the face of man, 1 saw him 1\" Edith was pale and anxious ; and as Heron looked at her, he saw her grow paler each mo ment, and for the first time in his life he thought that she wonld faint \" We coveted it not, Felix; but being ours, we will guard it and preserve it. \" \" Ay, will we I\" exclaimed Heron. \" And now, thanking you most kindly, Bridgewater, for this information, we will proceed to the Court ball\" \" One moment,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" I had a motive this evening in telling you so much.\" \" A motive, Bridgewater ? What is it ?\" \" It is to induce you either not to go to the Court ball, or if you do go, to avoid fee King.\" \" Ah ! Say you so ? \" \" Yes. I feel, from what I hear of the present state of mind of his Majesty in regard to you, feat he will treat yon in some manner slightingly; perhaps, indeed, so pulllcly affront you that your position may be painful.\" The Earl of W hitcombe paced the room with rapid strides twice before he replied, and then he stid, \" Bridgewater. Bridgewater ! do you think it possible feat the King can forget that as well as a King, he is or ought to be a gentleman?\" \" I hope not\" \" And I likewise. So we will go, my Edith, to this Court ball, come of it what may. Lights ! lights, here ! Surely the carriage waits !\" The folding doors of the magnificent drawing room were flung open A blaze of light was in fee corridor beyond. Throngs of richly dressed liveried dependants of the house of Whitcombe lined the grand staircase and hall. The magnifi cent carriage of the new Earl was at fee door, for at that time the high nobility of England were free from the affectation of plainness, and in many cases downright ugliness, which is now considered high ton in drees, equipage, and mansion. At that time there was a geod deal of outward \" Yon are ill, dear Edith. We will not go to this Court ball.\" \" I, too, have seen a face,\" said Edith faintly. \" Then yon confirm my impression that it was Jonathan Wild?\" \" No, I have not seen him, bnt I have seen another.\" \"Another?\" \" Yes, Warringdale ! The moment yon leaped from the carriage, he glared in npon me at this opposite window. Sin and suffering seemed to have made him ten years older than when I last looked upon his face. He was haggard, pale, and ghaitly. I could just observe that his clothing hang in tatters about him; but the malevolence \u2014 the deadly malevolence of his look, as he glared into fee carriage npon me, I shall n .ver forget\""], [43, "tCPITH HFRON. 37 The Earl of Whitcombe compressed his lips, and a deep frown sat npon his brow. \" They hannt ns yet \u2014 those two villains,\" he said. \" Like fee spirits of departed guilt they hannt us yet\" \"Home! home!\" said Edith faintly. \"I would fain go home, for I am unequal now to tbe task of attending the Court ball.\" \" We will both return. I care not for it\" She felt that \u2014 to use the common expression of many who are aware of such premonitions \u2014 \"something was about to happen.\" What the something would be, she had no po isible means of knowing. No sooner had Felix Heron, after some appro priate expression, left the apartment at Whit combe House, whither he had led her, than with a cry she summoned him baok again. \"Felix! Felix!\" \" Nay, Felix, you go to it. Let it bo my earnest request that you do so ; for after what has been told ns this evening by onr friend Bridgewater, it is not for you \u2014 the Earl of Whitcombe \u2014 to shun the presence of your enemies. Go, Felix, go ! \u2014 at my request, go. For your honour's sake, and for my sake, show yourself at this ball, and take your place, as yon should take it, among the highest and noblest of the land.\" He was by her side in a moment \" My own dear Edith \u2014 what is this feat alarms and perplexes you ? Is it possible that the mere consciousness that two of the greatest villains fee world ever beheld, are still in existence, moves you so?\" \" Alas ! alas ! I know not ; but my heart is weak.\" The carriage bad fallen out of the rank\u2014 for it weuld have been impossible to have kept tne whole cavalcade at a standstill \u2014 while this con versation was taking place between Heron and Edith. \" Cheer np, my Edith. Let what anxieties may at times surround us, at least we have one conso lation.\" \" One consolation, Felix?\" \" Yes, dear one. Does not your heart name it?\" \" Oh, yes ! yes ! A thousand times, yes, my Felix ! The consolation is our love.\" A brief order now sufficed to the astonished coachman ; and in a few seconds Edith was cross ing the hall again at Whitcombe House, pale and sad, and full of a thousand fears on account of this strange meeting with two of the worst foes she and her hnsband had ever had or could ever have. \" It is \u2014 it is indeed, a heavenly consolation !\" Edith rested her fair face upon the breast of Heron, and the flutter of anxiety feat had been at her heart appeared to subside. Tbe confused, anxious feeling of her mind appeared to pass away. Again and again, however, she urged Heron to repair to the Palace, for she felt that his honour was concerned in appearing on that occasion in the Conrt circle, where her partial fancy told her he would be peerless among his peers. \" How foolish and how weak you will think your Edith!\" 6he whispered gently. \" No, dearest \u2014 no ! Not so. There are times at which we cannot control what seems like the weakness of our hearts ; but what we call weak ness in those cases, and on those occasions, is bnt a certain redundance of feeling, which can only be evoked from the best and fee purest natures.\" \" Felix ! Felix ! Ever good, and kind, and true to your poor Edith.\" The young Earl of Whitcombe kissed the brow of his fair and loving Countess, as her face rested on his breast, and he said gently, \" My Edith, I will not go forth again to-night.\" \"Oh, yes, yes, Felix!\" \" You say yes ?\" \" I do\u2014 I do ! It must not be said, Felix, feat your wife's fears of she knew not what kept you at home, when tbe duty of your position called you to the palace of the Sovereign.\" \" I must own,\" said Felix gravely, \" that this night, of all others, I wonld fain show myself among my peers.\" \" You shall, Felix ! You shall!\" \" But you are not well, Edith!\" \"lam\u2014 I will be well!\" CHAPTER XIII. WHITCOMBE HOUSE BECOMES THSi SCENE OF AN ADVENTURE AND A MYSTERY. Never, in the midst of fee life cf danger, anxiety, and difficulty feat she had led in the forest of old Epping, had Edith felt the deep depression of spirits that had oome over her on this evening of the grand ball at St James's Palace. When apparently liberty and even life hung npon fee events of fee passing minute, Edith had ever found herself capable of controlling her emotions, and presenting a bold heart to fate. Now, how different from that courageous and noble confidence were her sensations ! She seemed to shrink from every little circum stance that presaged trouble or danger. The sight of the villain Warringdale, although her own judgment must have surely told her how perfectly safe she was from his machinations, filled her with a thousand fears. \" Let me look in your eyes, dear one ! What ? Tears ? No, I will not go !\" \" Yes, Felix ! For my sake, go. I will seek some rest, and the time shall not seem long to me feat you are away from me.\" \" If I thought so !\" \" Do think so \u2014 do, I pray yon, think so ! There ! it is nine o'clock ! You will be back by midnight, Felix, and yon will find your Edith cheerful and happy.\" \" Be it so then, dearest After what our good friend, the Earl of Bridgewater, has told us this night, I own I would fain show myself at the Court ball. You know, Edith, that my principle has always been to meet danger and suspicion face to face, and that by bo doing I have ever found it disarmed of half its fears.\" \" Go, Felix\u2014 yes, go, I pray you.\" Or it was the sight of that bad heart which seemed to fill her with those fears. Bnt fee fact was, that there was hanging over the soul of Edith one of those shadows which, let fee cold eye of philosophy look upon them how it may, do presage coming misfortune. As in the physical world, the storms and tem pests, which rend forests and destroy cities, are by various darkening indications in the atmo sphere heralded npon their path ; so in those affairs which compromise the feelings and the affee tions, there is a clouding of the heart and of the imagination, before fee moral tempest bursts upon us in all its fury. Edith felt thus."], [44, "38 EDITH HERON. \" You will rest, dear ?\" \" I will ; and perchance I shall sleep, to dream back to her, so soon as she could no longer look upon him. it was very strange. With difficulty, Edith repressed the inclination to call out aloud, \"Felix I Felix! Comeback to me !\" of yon.\" Felix Heron folded his Edith in his arms for a moment. He left a fond kiss of pure affection upon ber cheek, and then he repaired to the Court ball at the Palace. But she did restrain it At the dcor of Whitcombe House there still stood the rich and handsome carriage which had so recenly conveyed the Earl and Countess half way to St. James's. \" What can this mean ?\" she asked herself, \" Why am I so faint-hearted, and so full of vague, imaginary fears to-night ?\" EJith could not answer this question, but she tried to reason herself into a more equable frame of mind. At tbe aopearance of the Earl, the servants opened the carriage door for him, and let down the steps with a clatter. \u25a0' No 1\" said Heron, as he held his sword by fee middle of the sheath. \"No ; let the carriage be dt__>mi>sed. 1 walk to the Palace.\" Over and over again she asked he'self what harm now either Jonathan Wild or Lord War ringdale could do to Felix Heron. It was not of herself she thought, but of him. The idea that either or both of them would In his splendid Court costume the Earl of Whitcomba walked down St James's Street. attempt his assassination was dismissed as soon as it occurred to her- He hoped that by eo doing he should have a beit-r chance of seeing Jonathan Wild, or his wicked half-broth\u00b0r, Lord Warringdale As regarded Wild, if be should see him again, he made up his mind to effect bis arrest, if in the process the life of tbe villain were sacrificed. But what to do with Warringdale, tne Eail of Whitcombe could not well make up his mind ; for however much he might talk of casting from him all considerations connected with the ties of consanguinity,\u2014 Felix Heron, whenever it came to action, shrunk from attemptingmything against the life of that man. She knew that they had not courage to come within arm's length of him. But still Edith was sad and pale. Then she remembered how she had told Felix that duringhis absence she would seek repose, and so, on his return, be able to meet ti im refreshed and smiling. \" Yes,\" she said. \"I will rest It may be that I have been overtaxing my energies. And now I bethink me. we led eo quiet and so reti-ed a life in Epping Forest, almost retiring to rest with the birds at sunset, and rising as the lark carolled his morning song, feat this new life in London is strange and unsuitable.\" Elith sighed as she thought of fee many happy hours she had passed in Epping Forest. Were those hours never to return ? And how often had Warringdale attempted the life of Heron ? But the heart of Felix Heron was formed of very different materials o that of Lord Warring dale. Although he looked keenly to the right and to tbe left, as he walked the short distance from Whitcombe House to St. James's Palace, Heron .a*v nothing of either of his deadly foes. They had both disappeared. Wisely, probably, had they done so ; for had they been observed by Heron, nothing could have saved one \u2014 aud the other, very possibly, upon the impulse of the moment, might have found him sell a prisoner. The Palace was reached. They had certainly fled. Then Edith, with her mind full of these thoughts, sad and pleasant by turns, ascended the staircase that connected the saloon floor of Whit combe House with the suite of chambers above. There was a long and wide corridor, which went the whole length of the house, on that upper floor. Portraits of the Whitcombe family and many old \" battle pic.unss,\" of conflicts both at home and abroad, in which various Earls of Whitcombe had been engaged, filled up the panelling of that corridor. Felix Heron being on foot, had not lo wait the tedious process of being set down in his turn in the long string of carriages ; so feat, despi e the delay that had taken place by the return of the Wbitcombe carriage to the mansion, Heron was actually in the Palace before he could possibly have arrived had the carriage continued its route. No less than ei^ht doors opened from tha cor ridor on either side of it. Tho doors to the left led to all the best sleeping apartments. Thre.'i of those apartments communicated the one with the other. Old St James's was a blaze of light: the sounds of martial music silled the air, as the bands of the different regiments of the Guards played in the court-yards of the Palace. All that was rich, great, di.'ingui6_ed, and noble of London society, were the guests of the Sovereign on that occasion. But it is not with Felix Heron, E\u00abl Whit combe, or with the Court ball at St. James's that we have to do at present although sufficient events of importance there occurred to hi-i to merit detail in another chapter. We must leave him on the entrance of the *bode of the monarch, while we repiir again to Whit combe House, and to Edith. The moment Felix Heron lad left hie Ziith, he wonld fain have called him b___t agn'u It was those three apartments which were in the special occupation of the Earl and the Conn tesa. One of fes rooms was the old state bed-cham ber of Whitcombe House. Felix Heron had had the heavy ancient furni ture moved to another room of the mansion ; and the bed-chamber was as handsome, as magnifi cent an one as the palace of the Sovereign could boast of. Immediately opening from this chamber was another room, the communicaiing doors with which bad been removed, and heavy massive cur tains of green silk substituted. Tbat room was furnished as a dressing-room. and tbe apartment beyon i it whi -I wan reached past similar curtains, was a k;ud of library ot morning room, provided with hooks, music, and every little beauty and luxury which w uld temp? The same feeling of depression whi.-h hie pre tence had for the morueiii cleared awa?, came"], [45, "EDITH HERON. 39 any one to while away an hour of leisure within it at any time of night or day. Edith passed through the state bed-chamber, and made her way to the middle room \u2014 that is, to the dressing room. Her own attendant was there. Or if she had heard a something in the nature of a tangible sound, might it not easily come of those accidental echoes from the open streets, which, in so mysterious a fashion, will at times make themselves heard in houses? Oh, yes, easily. Or might it not be one of those strange move ments of furniture which, on the occasion of changes in the state of the atmosphere, will take place? Or, perhaps, the mere opening of the door of that third room had been sufficient to cause the sound? Edith had taken from her wrists, as she passed through the bed-chamber, the diamond and opal bracelets she had on ; and walking up to the dressing table which she and Heron used in com mon \u2014 for they had not yet learnt to like the fashion of distinct establishments\u2014 Edith laid the bracelets on the velvet cover, as she said, \" Margaret, I shall not want you.\" The waiting maid curtsied, and hoped her ladyship was \" better.\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 yes \" Edith was glad to be alone, now. Before Heron had left the house, she had seemed to have a cer tain dread of solitude ; but now that he was gone, the presence of any one else appeared irksome to her. All these suppositions rushed through the mim of Edith. But was she satisfied wife any of them ? No ; decidedly not. The sound she had heard, although it was of a nature she could not define, yet presented itself to her mind as a something not to be accounted for by any of the suppositions which naturally oc curred to her. Rapidly then, and without the assistance of her maid, the Countess of Whitcombe divested herself of several articles of costly jewellery, which she had put on for the purpose of attending the Court ball. \"What was it?\" The question came from her lips this time audibly. Then she approached the long, silken bell-cord, a touch at which she knew would toon summon aid \u2014 but was aid wanted ? What was she to say ? Was she to own herself frightened by some acci dental or, perhaps after all, some imaginary sound ? Those two magnificent bracelets of brilliants and opals (it was the fashion then to wear bracelets in pairs) \u2014 a circlet of diamonds from her hair\u2014 some rings of great cost and beauty \u2014 and a girdle, in the fastening of the front of which was a ruby of singular beauty. All these various artioles, without casting a glance upon them, although they were worth at the least ten thousand pounds, Edith laid hastily, and with a sensation of relief that she was for the pre sent rid of them, on to the velvet cover of the dressing-table. Then she paused a few moments, and asked herself feu question\u2014 \" Shall I try to sleep or wait for Felix?\" Edith hesitated. Then she was glad she had so hesitated, for upon approaching the dressing-table \u2014 upon which were branch candelabra, one of which she had intended to carry into the third room \u2014 she saw what she thought was an explanation of fee sound. One of the magnifi cent diamond and opal brace lets lay on the floor. Nothing could be simpler now than to account for the sound. Of course she had carelessly placed that brace let too near to the edge of the dressing-table, and it had fallen off- It seemed to her heart as if some echo had uttered, \" Wait for Felix.\" Edith then walked slowly and thoughtfully into the third apartment. There was, however, no light there. A bright and pleasant fire, though, partly of eea c ml and partly of cedar wood, was burning on fee hearth) and the atmosphere of the apartment was soft and pleasant. It was fee summer-time, but wife the usual capricionsness of the English climate, a cold wind had set in after the sun had set, and that pretty little sparkling fire was pleasant to see. It was pleasant to feel, likewise. But Edith thought she would like to read, to while away the hour or two till the return of Felix. Yes, that must be it Edith told herself, \"That must be it!\" but at the same time that she did so, she did not feel quite satisfied that fee theory was a correct one If the bracelet had rested for one minute suffi ciently on the table, why did it not remain there ? She picked it up, and made an experiment with it. Placing it close to the edge of the table, she slowly tipped it over. The costly jewel fell on the soft thick carpet without making a sound sufficient to reach one foot beyond it. That, then, was not what she had heard. Edith with her hand upon the candelabrum she meant to carry into the next apartment turned completely round, and looked at every part of fee room. She could easily have rung for some of those numerous attendants of Whitcombe Honse who were ready to obey her slightest wish, but Edith preferred solitude just then. She stepped back to the dressing-room. At the moment she did so a strange sound struck her ear. All things were as usual. There was no disturbance. Then Edith lighted the candelabrum, and made her way into the state bed-room. As she crossed its threshold, she beard another slight noise. Edith turned deadly pale. Was there some one concealed in those rooms ? It was a very slight sound, but a sound of some sort it was, and it came from the dressing room. Edith paused on the threshold. Her heart stood still for a moment What was it? who was it? If so, what was fee object ? Robbery or murder ? Perhaps both ! That was not fee time to conrt solitude \u2014 she would now cry for help. The bell-cord in the The stillness then of those three apartments was most profound. Surely fancy had deceived her, and she had heard no sound."], [46, "40 EDITH HERON. dressing-room, if once touched, would quickly bring some of the servants to her. Edith turned from fee state bed-chamber ; and as she did so, she heard the sound in the dressing room again. What could it mean ? Was she the slave of fancy ? Did she conjure in her own imagination those indications ef the presence of some one in those apartments of her own and her husband's house ? What is it that seems to come to ber memory like some echo of the past ? Is it anything in fee looks \u2014 is it anything in fee tones of that man ? Surely, yes \u2014 in both \u2014 in both ; and yet of what or of whom is it feat he reminds her ? Her ima gination is a chaos of undecided thought; she teels that if she could move \u2014 if there were no danger, no difficulty in fee act, she wonld not touch that silken bell-rope. \"Who? What?\" she whispered\u2014 she had not power to raise her voice. \" Who are you ? What are yon ?\" \" Ha ! bi ! A fine question that, my lady, when you sind me here ! Who I am, don't matter the snap of a pistol-flint What I am, yon may guess.\" \"A\u2014 a\u2014 thief?\" The situation, at all events, was not endurable. Edith set down fee candelabrum on a table\u2014 she approached the bell-cord. \" On your life ! \u2014 on yonr life !\" cried a sup pressed voice. \" By perdition, you die, if an alarm is given !\" Edith uttered a faint cry. She turned in the direction of the sound, and from the back of fee toilette table there rose up a man, who presented full at her face a pistol, tbe barrel of whioh she was attracted to observe was peculiarly long and peculiarly bright \" Well, my lady, we won't quarrel about terms. Call me a thief, if you like \u2014 I mean to earn the title. Stir not, on yonr life !\" The man, with an easy movement feat showed he was young and agile, stepped round the toilette table, and his eyes fell npon the rich trinkets that lay there with greedy delight. \" Good !\" he said. \" It don't often happen that such a sparkling booty as this falls to my share ' I daresay, my lady, you can very well spare these pretty little toys, and they will be most exceedingly useful to me?\" CHAPTER XIV. THE ADVENTURE OF EDITH IN THE CHAMBER AT WHITCOMBE HOUSE LEADS TO IMPORTANT RESULTS. There was a sneering tone abont fee style in which this man spoke, whioh was very different to that which might have been expected from an ordinary housebreaker. And yet what else was he ? What else could he be? It was a positive relief to Edith to see this man in that magnificent apartment, and to hold to her heart fee supposition, after all fee fears and all the excitements of that evening, it was nothing but simple robbery she had to dread. Besides, in the face of that man, neither Jona than Wild nor Lord Warringdale was to be re cognised. Who else conld Edith have to fear ? His air and manner, too, were almost at times those of a gentleman. The apparel, bare and out of condition as it was, which ho wore was fashionable ; and he tossed aside some articles upon the toilette -table wife an easy grace, as he grasped at the rich jewels. For a moment or two a mist seemed to float be fore the eyes of Edith, and she feared she was about to faint. This was some vnlgar ruffian, after all, who came to that splendid mansion for purposes of robbery. What a relief it was to Edith, to find all her fears have such a conclusion ! \u2014 to feel that creeping horror that had set for hours at her heart, all accounted for by such a common-place affair. Was it so accounted for? The mere fear of so doing rallied all her ener gies, and she shook off the disposition to sink to the floor of that room in a state of insensibility. Well for thee, 0 Edith Heron, would it have been if the next half-hour of thy existence had been passed in a trance, during which fee world and thy fair, pure, and spotless soul had held no communion. Then feat midnight robber would have departed with his spoil the way he came, whatever way that was. We shall see. The attitude of Edith was one of alarm, cer tainly. It was one of surprise, likewise. The colour rushed to her face, and then she became ghastly pale ; and although by stretching out her hand she could have touched that silken bell- rope, which would have brought her succour, she felt as if she had not fee power to make even that slight exertion. Then wonld thy gentle heart, 0 Edith Heron, have escaped the burden ef a perilons secret ! But it was to be. Edith Heron was on that night at a crisis of her fate. It was not exactly the menacing attitude of the robber which restrained her, but there was a sen sation of weakness at her heart, which made her helpless for a moment as a child. And fee long bright barrel of that threatening pistol was still before her ; but over it \u2014 exceeding it too in brightness \u2014 were the blazing fixed eyes of fee ruffian, who had risen np as if by magic from behind fee toilette-table, in that apartment of luxury and magnificence. \" One cry \u2014 one movement feat shall place me in danger \u2014 and yonr life\u2014 your life \" He did not seek to finish the sentence.

No doubt, with a diabolical calculation, he had bsen preparing for that, spring, since the object of it was to grasp the silken bell-cord above the point at which, situated as he was, it waa possible for Edith to seize it rageouj heart of Edith in thraldom for so long, had now to a great extent dissipated. She began to think it a shame and a reproach that she, the wife of the gallant Captain Felix Heron, should allow herself so coolly and so easily to be despolied of those jewels which had been his gifts to her. Edith turned upon the robber, and there was a look of dauntless courage upon her face. \" No, villain !\" shB said ; \" your triumph shall not be so easy as you suppose. Restore those jewels to the place from whence you took them, or I will alarm the house.

The robber succeeded. He did grasp the b*ll-rop\u00bb above the point at which Edith hsld it, so tbat she had no power to summon assistance by its means. \"Another step,\" exclaimed Edith, \"and I ring this bell !\" She placed her hand on the silken cord. The robber paussdi \"So, so! You have plucked up a .oarage wondrously suddenly! Do you want me to add another murder to the one which already in this hoill\"-* \" \"Help!\u2014 help! Oh, Felix, help!\" That cry came naturally from the lips of Edith, although she had suoh good reason to know and to believe that Felix Heron was beyond hearing the cry. \"Confusion setee yon!\" said the housebreaker. \" Your tongue is a worse alarm than any belli\" \"Help! Oh, help!\" \"Peace. I say !\" The robber closed with her, and grasping her wrist with one hand, he held the pistol he had in the other close to her eyes, as be said, \" Another such a cry, and by the heaven above us, you die!\" i proised ber hand upon her heart What words were those this man now paused in uttering ? \" Another murder?\" she gasped. \"No!

Good night\" \" Leave the jewels.\" \" Leave the what?\" The costly bracelet the robber had placed on his own wrist for safety had not been well clasped ; probably, it was of rather too small dimensions for him, and so had missed its fastening. But be the causa what it might the bracelet at this mement gave way; and fell clattering on to the edge of a chair, and then to tbe floor. \" Silence !\" added the ruffian ; \" or this night I will do a deed that shall stir the ashes of even the dead Judge in his grave.\" Edith's eyes fell upon the wrist of the robber as the bracelet came loose from it. A look of horror elowlv spread over her face. Her lips parted as though she felt inclined to scream, but no sound came irnm between them, save a low, gasping sob. A ten ibis thought ! A fearful idea! \" The jewels\" \" Ha ! That's cool. Leave the plunder, after all my trouble in getting possession of it ? No, not exactly, my lady And oowyou mention jewels, my eyes light upon that circlet of rubies upon your forefinger, with longing admiration. I must have it\" A suspicion of a possibility, that was enough to turn her heart to ice, came over her. There was a distinct scar on ihe wrist of the ruffianly assailant. Such a scar as had been mentioned in that letter which was addressed to Edith from her dead father, Judge Tarleton. \" Gracious heaven, help me !\" \"Help yon?\" said the robber. \"What now is the matter? Am I so ugly that I scare the senses from you ?\" \" No, no ! Oh, heaven !\" \" What do you Bee ? Why do yon look at mo in that mad fashion ?\" \" Never !\" The glance of the robber assumed a baleful, threatening aspect, and he stepped two paces nearer te Edith. \" Beware !\" she oried. \" Beware of what ? A pretty woman, with a rnby ring upon ber finger ?\" Edith was unarmed- It was possible that this robber might not scruple to inflict some serious in jury upon her if foiled in his attempt ; and what recompense could she offer to Felix Heron, even in fee restoration of those splendid jewels, for an injury done to her? Would it not be better to let that robber depart with the booty he had in his possession, than to risk a collision in which even a wound, should she receive it, would be poorly paid for by the pre servation of all those sparkling gems. \" Go,\" eaid Edith. \" Take away the plunder you are already possessed of, and may heaven have mercy upon you ! \" Mercy upon me \u2014 upon me !

An old hag of a woman, who had the care of me since my childhood in one of the West India islands, at length managed to bring me to London. Then she died, and with her last breath told me my name was John Tarleton, and my father a judg_.\" Edith uttered a cry of despair. At one moment she held out both her arms to this midnight robber, and perfectly surprised him by the action, since it looked as if she would clasp him to her heart, and then she wrung her hands and wept. \" Now, by George, I can't make you out at all, my lady ! What do yon mean, and who are you, since you know who I am so well?\" \" You do not know who I am?\" CHAPTER XV. EDITH MAKES A TERRIBLE DISCOVERY, AND RECOGNISES A BROIHER IN THE MURDERER OF THE LATE EARL- The way in which the midnight .robber of Whit combe House asked tbe question of Edith, of how she became aware that his name was Tarleton, was an admission that such was the fact \" How should I ?\" The worst\u2014 the most terrible suspicions of the fair and gentle Countess of Whitcombe were confirmed. \" But you are here\u2014 here, in this house?\" \" Yes ; to lay hands on what I can.\" \" Then \u2014 then \u2014 you \u2014 you \" \" Well, what ?\" \" Oh, heaven help me' \u2014 heaven help me!\" Edith tottered to a cbair, on which she sunk, In that robber \u2014 in that man who had made his way into Whitcombe House, intent on plunder \u2014 ready, too, for murder \u2014 she beheld the brother who was mentioned in the epistle of her dead father, Sir John Tarleton. and clasping her hands over her face, she wept bitterly. A clock in the chamber struck one. There was fee scar upon his wrist There was his own admission that his name was John Tarleton ; and about bis voice, his look, his man ner, there was that undefinab'e likeness and re membrance of the deceased Judge, which, from the first, had struck so strangely upon, the senses of Edith. Edith started. The robber uttered an imprecation. The knocking of his confederate in the room above became more violent. \"This is trifling, madam. Give me fee ring and let me be off.\" She staggered forward. \"Keep off I Keep off!\" Edith's lip9 moved : she wanted to say that he had nothing to fear, but she had not strength to say it. \" Wha t's thc matter ? Are you mad ?\" \" No \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" \" No, no ! Read that letter !\" Edith had left it on fee dressing-table. He took it up impatiently, and turned to the signature. When he saw that that signature was \" John Tarleton \" he became interested, and rapidly read the letter through \u2014 that same letter which was handed to Edith on the night of her first visit to Whitcombe House. \" So, so !\" said tha robber; \" then this letter is from Judge Tarleton.\" \" Your father.\" \" And it was sent or addressed to\u2014 to \" She reached the toilette table. She opened a drawer. \"Ah, more plunder ?\" \" No \u2014 no \u2014 no!\" With difficulty \u2014 for her hands trembled exces sively \u2014 Edith produced a small silver key, which hung by a chain of plaited velvet and gold wire from her neck. That key opened a small oblong box in the drawer of the toilette -table. In feat box were, cherished records of Edith's life. \" Your sister !\" \"Ah! my sister! Stop, stop! You don't mean that \u2014 that you\u2014 that this house \u2014 this lordly man sion \u2014 these jewels \u2014 this magnificence, belong to you, and that you are the daughter of Judge Tarleton ?\" The first few words in writing she had received from Felix Heron. A lock of her mother's hair, which Lady Castle neau bad given her. \"lam! lam!\" The robber drew a long breath. The colour fled from his face, and he looked white and ghastly. At that terrible moment an awful likeness to the dead Judge Taileton was presented by that dis solute son. Various other little memorabilia, wb;ch snch a kind and affectionate heart as Edith's was sure to treasure up. And among those things, which each spoke of some event or of some affecii.n, was the letter which had been found on the dead body of her Edith regarded him wilh terror. \" My sister ! My own sister 1\" \" Brother ! brother !\""], [50, "EDITH HERON. 44 \" And\u2014 and yon\u2014 yon \u2014 this house yours?\" \" My husband's.\" \"Husband?\" \" Is the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" Then yon are the Countess of Whitcombe ; and this house, so long, as they told me, uninhabited, is yours ?\" \" It is so.

Escape ; but come to this house to-morrow, and I shall then have spoken to my husband, who is good and noble and generous and true. The brother of his Edith will not need to lead a life of danger or reproach.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Oh, that's it, is it ?\" \" That is it, brother !\" \" Well, I was thinking it would be best for you to supply me wife what I want, to lead the life I like, from time to time, without troubling the Earl, who may take exception to me in some way.\" \" No, no ! A thousand times, no I I cannot do as yon suggest. He must know all \" \"Well,\" added John Tarleton, with a slight sneering expression, \" it won't do for beggars to be choosers. You must do as you like, though I don't know what to say to my pal above.\" \" Here is gold !\" \" Ah, that's to the purpose !\" \" The purse is well filled!\" \" Take it now, and be gone !\" \" Be it so. It might be a little awkward for this Earl you speak of to come home and sind me here I suppose he is at the Court ball ?\" \" He is \u2014 he is ! Oh, go, go !\" \"Well, I'm going ! But tell me, sister Edith \u2014 now that I am here, just tell me who was in this house about three weeks ago? I was told the house was quite empty and reported to be haunted, and I made my way into it one evening by fee same route that I came to-n;ght !\" \"Yon\u2014 yon?\" Edith sprang to her feet. A look of horror spread over her face. \" You \u2014 you ?. One evening ?\" \" Yes. What's the matter now ? I came to see what I could pick up, and my pal \u2014 fee same who is above us now \u2014 a good fellow, though a little rough, waited for me.

One in particu lar I found, fee hilt of which was a blaze of jewels.\" \"Oh, heaven!\" \" What now ? You seem full of all sorts of fears and panics. What is it, now ?\" \" And is feat all you have to say to a newly found brother, Sister Edith?\" \" All ? What would you ?\" \" Nofond embrace \u2014 no soft kiss \u2014 no affection ?\" Edith shuddered. \" Go !\" she said. \" Be content feat you will for fee future know no want that fee Earl of Whit combe will not supply.\" \" Go on ; go \u2014 go on !\" \" Well, I had hardly got it into my hands, when I heard the doors of fee hall open, and several people came up fee grand staircase. It was time then for me to go ; and I thought the Basest way would be to leave the mansion by the front door. As I saw fee people \u2014 several ladies and gentle men \u2014 pass into one of fee large saloons, I slipped down the staircase.\" \" Well, my Lady Countess sister, it's a strange world we live in, and this may turn ont all right; but yet there are some wise proverbs going, and one of tbem is that ' A bird in the hand is worth two in fee bush.' \" \" I do not comprehend you, brother.\" It was strange what a new pleasure it was to Edith to utter the word brother. \" With\u2014 that sword ?\" \" To be snie ! I carried it in my hand, as the beet plunder I could hope to get in fee honse ; but fate was against me\" Edith sobbed as though her very heart would break. \" Why, then, it just comes to this. How do I know what sort of light this Earl of Whitcombe, your husband, may regard me in? Husbands don't generally take to their wives' brothers, es pecially when fee introduction has been through the roof of the house, over some stables in fee mews behind it.\" \" You met eome one,\" she said, falterlngly, \" on the grand staircase \u2014 a peer, in his robes?\" \" Whew !\" whistled John Tarleton. \" It seems to me, Bister, that you know all about it!\" \" Oh, terrible knowledge !\" \" 1 don't see that it can matter to you a bit. It was not your peer \u2014 not your husband, was it?\" \" No, no !\" Edith sighed. \"And so you see, sister Edith, I am thinking \u2014 1 am of opinion that it will be decidedly the best plan to say nothing to him about me.\" \" I cannot do that. I cannot \u2014 I dare not\" \" You dare not ? Oh, then, this Earl keeps a tight hand, eh ?\" \"No, no! As heaven is my judge, he is all goodness, all nobleness, all affection, truth and generosity !\" \" Bnt you said you dared not\" \" I did ; and I say again I dare not bo palter wife my affections, and commit such high treason against the heart that is so true and noble. \" Well, I thonght not ; or he would hardly have been at the Court ball to-night \" \" Lost !\u2014 lost !\" moaned Edith. \" What is lost ?

There was a slight hesitation as to the admit tance of Felix Heron ; for although he announced his name andiank, his person, naturally enough, was totally unknown to the officials of the Palace. He was not in the condition of most young men of the peerage, who succeeded to titles and to dignities by the death of their fathers, and who are well known previously for years, by the sub sidiary titles, either actual or of courtesy, which belong to them. On the contrary, Felix Heron was a complete stranger. He had, so to speak, stepped from amid the tangled brushwood of Epping Forest, into the Court of St. James's \" Horror\u2014 horror \u2014 horror !\" \"Hold! don't go on repeating that w^rd! What do yoH mean by it? Am I mad, or are you?\" \" Murderer!\" Bnt there was nothing false or supercilious in the manner in which he was treated by the officials : they really and honestly did not know him, and it was quite a relief, both to him and to them, when Colonel Trelawney, of the Royal Guard, appeared in the vestibule. \" Colonel !\" said Felix Heron, in that soft, deep, calm voice which was one of his characteristics, \u2014 \" Colonel, will you vouch for me that I am what I am.\" \" No ! It was self-defence !\" \"Murderer! That peer, whom you so slew, was my husband's father !\" CHAPTER XV. \" Certainly, my Lord Whitcombe : I suppose you are personally unknown ?\" The throng of royal attendants stepped aside at once, and wife low bows sanctioned fee en trance of the Earl. the earl of whitcombe meets with a cool rechttion at the court ball cf st. james's. Indeed, one went so far as to apologize. \" My lord,\" he said, \" I'm sure your lordship would be as disinclined to admit a spurious Earl of Whitcombe to his Majesty's presence as we can be.\" The Court of St. James's was a suspicions one, at the period of which we write. There was one word which always acted as a terror upon the monarch and all his satellites, while, at the same time, it served as a reproach to everybody else. That word was Jacobinism. \" Certainly,\" replied Heron, \" You do your duty, sir, and yoa have done it with courtesy.\" By the side of Colonel Trelawney, Heron passed on, and the distance they had to traverse, before reaching the outer saloon of the three which contained the courtly guests, was sufficient to enable Felix Heron to explain to Colenel Trelawney how it was feat Edith, complaining of iadisposition, had returned to Whitcombe House, but had urged him, as a matter of principle, to make his appearance at the ball. \" Your are quite right to show yourself, my Lord Whitcombe,\" replied the Colonel. \" This very little episode at the entrance shows how necessary it is that yonr face should not be com pletely strange about the Court\" \" There is another reason.\" The recent revolution in England, which had cast the Stuarts from the throne, had not yet be come sufficiently historical, by age, to remove it out of the sphere of men's passions, prejudices and interests Everybody who was wished to be accused of anything indefinite; or who, by any means, lost favour with fee reigning authorities, was at once called a Jacobite. That term at the Court of St James's was at once considered sufficient to comprehend any pos- sible ameunt of villany, rascality, treason, cow- ardice, or perjury that could be laid at fee door of any one individual. Hence, there was an uneasy sensation abont the atmosphere of the Court. Many of the highest nobility, who thronged about the person of the monarch, were the sons of men who had been high in favour wife the de- posed James ; and there was scarcely a family of any distinction, at that period, some member of which was not in hiding or in exile, in conse- quence of too close an adherence to the cause of tbe deposed branch of fee royal family. Old St James's Palace, on the evening of the Court ball \u2014 to which fee Earl of Whitcombe went alone, and en foot \u2014 was made fee best of, in the way of decoration and brilliant ill main a- \" I know to what you allude ; and our friend Bridgewater is of the same opinion as myself \u2014 namely, that there is some secret and underhand influence at work against yon. What it is, we know not ; but it seems to be pretty weU under stood by those who have an opportunity of judg ing, that the mind of his Majesty is warped in some manner as regards yoa.\" \" And yet my reception fee other day was so gracious !\" Colonel Trelawney railed and shook his head. He spoke in so low a tone of voice feat it was impossible feat his words could travel beyond the ears for which they were intended. \" Put not your trust in princes.\" \" A wise saying,\" replied Heron ; \" and I shall bear it in mind.\" \" It will be well to do so.\" \" Yes, for a little while ; for, after all, what have I to do wife this King and his caprices ?\" \\ tion. , Bnt for the one radical defect in that old Palace \u2014 viz., the lownessof fee ceilings \u2014 the suite of rooms opened to the King's visitors on this occasion wonld have looked truly royal and gorgeously magnificent As it was, the effect was cumbrous and heavy '-\u25a0"], [52, "46 EDITH HERON. \u25a0 Hush ! my lord, treason !\" \" Petty treason, call it,\" smiled Heron. \" I feel assured that Edith will agree \u00bbith me, that we are neither of us of fee complexion to borrow sun shine from fee atmosphere of a C-nurt Far away from London, amid the sylvan beauties of the quiet country, we shall find serenity and happiness, undisturbed by fee cabals of courtiers, or fee frowns and smiles of monarchs.\" \" I have not tbe houour of your lordship's ac quaintance,\" added the grinning personage, \" bnt we of the Upper House should all know each other ; and 1 presume vour lordship will take your seat in die Lords as soon as fee session opens ? I am Lo d Clackington \u2014 Lord Clacking ton, at your service. A poor junior baron, my Lord Whitcombe.\" Felix Heion bowed ; and by this time a throng of persons had gradually gathered about him. \" Allow me,\" said Lord Clackington, \" to intro duce everybody generally to the Earl of Whit combe, and the Earl of Whitcombe to everybody.\" Lord Clackington seemed to think this a great stroke of wit, ior he laughed until he was nearly choked, and then proceeded to enumerate, for Heron's information, fee names of the bowing throng about him. \"More treason! more treason!\" smiled the Colonel. \"Don't you know that every nobleman who refuses to haunt the Conrt is considered to be a Jacobite in disguise ?\" \" It.may be so.\" \" And all such are believed to be waiting for a restoration of the Stuarts.\" \" I hope I shall not be accused ef waiting for a restoration of the Stuarts. But it strikes me, Oolone 1, after what you say of the Court, that this discourse is dangerous\" \" Indeed, and in truth, it is ; but I have duties here to-night, apart from that of making one of the guests You see I am in uniform as Colonel of the Guard, so I must leave you to your own devices, with fee hope that you may spend a pleasanter evening in the saloons of royalty than \u2014than\u2014\" Little attention, indeed, did the new Earl of Whitcombe pay to Lord Clackington's roll-call of titles. He heard them as if he heard them net ; but with a gentle and yet lofty courtesy, he bowed to the group of persons abont him. At all event-?, this was not the sort of reception Felix Heron was led to expect, and he found him self becoming rapidly rather popular in fee saloons of St James's Palace, than otherwise. He felt himself compelled, whether he would or not, to engage in conversation with a variety of persons ; aud as he slowly made his way into the King's Saloon, he seemed to carry with Tiim, and to draw after him in his onward progress, at least fifty people, who seemed disposed to be as civil as possible to fee new peer. To be snre, now and then, a few expressions jarred npon his ear.*. \"Immensely rich \u2014 accumulated rentals \u2014 enor mous property \u2014 no doubt a series of brilliant fetes at Whitcombe House \u2014 thinks nothing of money, so they say \u2014 does ho play ? \u2014 quite a uew star in the galaxy of fashion \u2014 a good-looking fellow \u2014 a strange story \u2014 wonder if it's all true ?\" These aud similar fragments of conversation reached the ears of Felix Heron, and rather jarred npon his sensibilities. His intention of leaving the Palace as quickly as he possibly could, after going throngh the duty of presenting himself to the Sovereign, was by no means shaken On the contrary, it may be said that the desire to get out of the perfumed atmo sphere in which he was increased every moment Yet it was with considerable difficulty that Heron made his way into that third saloon, at fee farther end of wh ch, sitting upon crimson and gilt ohairs of state were the royal family. The King himself was a little in advance, and occupied a chair with an enormous back to it; so feat quite above his head, as he sat, might be fully seen, m blazonry of gold and colours, the royal arms. \" Than you expect, Colonel ?\" \" Well, I don't know. It is not likely any one will venture to insult you ; and as regards a cool reception from the King^^\u2014\" \"I can laugh at it\" \" More treason !\" said fee Colonel, with a smile, ai he left the Earl of Whitcombe in fee se ond ealoon, in which there was a gr^it throng of gu\u00bbsts, who were ali with a quiet persistence pressing forward to pass through a pur of fold ing doors to the third apartment, where the King and royal family received their visitors. The entertainment was called a Court ball, but the attempts at dancing were very feeble. H_d it been called a Court gossip, the term would have been nearer fee mark ; for at times the buzz of whispered conversation rose so high that any one might have imagined thousands of bees wore busy seeking for honey in that Court atmo sphere. From this second saloon \u2014 which was the largest of the three \u2014 there were two entrances to wnat was c.tlled the King's Saloon ; but the courteous and urbane officials of the Palace succeeded in guiding the throng of visitors who wished to enter the King's Saloon through one pair of fold ing doors. The other was preserved as an exit from the royal presence. It was curions to see the miscellaneous throng of bowing visitors coming backwards from the Kiu^'s Saloon into felt middlo one \u2014 etiquette re quiring that they should keep their faces towards royalty. Felix Heron devoutly wished himself in Epping Forest. The throng in this chamber was of a much more courtly character, as regards its actions, than that in the outer saloons. Here there was none of that buzz of conversation. All was silent and decorous ; and the most singular effect to fee eyes of Felix Heron was the sidelong manner in which every one moved, except when advancing right up to the royal circle. Heron reached fee King, and bowed. Lord Olacking.on was immediately behind him, and seemed, indeed, as if he had followed him, in order accurately to remark the exact degree of royal favour in which the new Earl stood. Thy King bent his brows upon Felix Heron, and assuming a confused look of semi-recollection, \" I will go through the King's Saloon,\" he said to himself; \"I will bow to him aud the royal family, and perchance say a word or two if I am spoken to ; and then I will leave this glittering scene of insincerity and sham courtesies, and repair to my home as quickly as may be.\" \" My Lord Whitcombe, I think ?\" said a voice immediately behind him. Heron turned sharply A grinning, ap.-like personage, dressed in the extreme of fashion \u2014 holding a snuff-box in his hand\u2014 stood bowing."], [53, "EDITH HERON. 47 he said, \" We have scarcely the pleasure of re membering you, sir.\" Heron replied quietly, and with dignity. \" I grieve that your Majesty should bo soon have forgotten one, who, by your Majesty's special grace, surmounted fee difficulties in the way of his inheritance; otherwise, the earldom of Whit combe might have been but a shadow of fee future.\" Another moment, and be had passed through them. \" For ever ! \u2014 for ever !\" he said. \" This is my first and last visit to the Court Welcome \u2014 thrice welcome rather would be thy leafy glades, oh, beautiful Eppii.g! Thrice welcome the green sward, the tangled brake, the great trees, and all fee sights and sounds of forest life ! I am not for Courts, and Courts are not for me !\" A slight flush came over the face of the King. Perhaps even royalty was a little ashamed of the disingenuous manner in which it was behaving. \"Oh! we recollect \u2014 we recollect, my Lord of Whitcombe.\" CHAPTER XVI. \"I have that honour, sire I\" \" Well, my lord, we sincerely hope that onr Privy Council, upon full inquiry, will be able to rectify the somewhat hasty and inconsiderate manner in which we, in a non- official form, sanc- tioned your c'aims.\" \" I was not aware, your Majesty,\" said Heron, \" that my position was still a subject of dispute, and required ratification.\" \" Nay, my lord ; but it does, though.\" \" I grieve to hear it,\" added Heron, \" for I took the King's word.\" The King bit his lip, and an angry look passed over his face. \" We have fee pleasure to bid you good evening, my Lord Whitcombe.\" \" And I have the honour of wishing your Maiesty many good and happy evenings; and I think he will be a bold man, whether of your Majesty's Privy Council or not, who will challenge my right when your Majesty chooses to accord to me the title of Lord Wkitcombe.\" FELIX HERON FINDS THAT DLSGRACK AT COUR- 1S CONTAGIOUo \u2014 THiL FRACAS AT COURT. A remarkable change took place in the reception of the Earl of Whitcombe when he passed throngh the folding doore which led away from the King's Saloon. A change so great from the manner in which he had been escorted to the presence of the King, that he could not fail to remark it instantly. The throng of courtiers, of nobles, of place hunters, and nonsensical fribbles, who had almost persecuted him with attentions, had all disappeared as if by magic. No touch of the wand of an enchanter conld have resolved these creatures into thin air so quickly as they removed themselves out of the pith of the Earl of Whitcombe. And why was that ? The secret was easy of solution \u2014 the Earl was in disgrace with fee King- That angry flush had been seen upon the brow of majesty \u2014 those harsh, insulting words had been heard from the royal lips \u2014 and oh! worse than all, the Earl of Whitcombe bad dared to defy the wrath of majesty, instead of seeking, with humble gestures and bated breath, to deprecate it There was no hope for him. If he had bowed down to the dust \u2014 if he had received, with a terrified submission, the injustice of the King, it would have been another matter. But he was not humble ! The King felt that he had made a mistake, and was angry accordingly. He could be coarse and brutal whenever it so suited him ; and he was cer tainly so on this occasion. \" Sir !\" he said, \" would you have me call you a highwayman ?\" Heron felt the taunt, and an angry reply rose to his lips. By a great effort, however, he restrained it; but for the life of him, he could not avoid repeating tho words of Colonel Trelawney, which just then seemed to ring in his very ears. \" Put not your trust in princes !\" Felix Heron uttered the sentence clearly and distinctly; and then without the slightest lapse of ceremony, he moved from the presence of the King \u2014 keeping his face towards him, and making his way very elowly and steadily towards the other two folding doors than those at which he had entered, in order to remove himself as quickly as possible from the royal presence. As the Enl of Whitcombe uttered that proverb, which had teen sanctioned hy the wisdom of ages, the King's countenance flushed to the colour of a dusky red, and he sprang to his feet. A deathlike stillness reigned in the saloon. Every one seemed panic-stricken, and to expect some undignified explosion of wrath on the part of fee monarch. He was lost ! No Court atmosphere was for his breath. The crowd of parasites felt that there would be con tamination in his presence\u2014 contagion in his touch. To the right and to the left the throng sepa rated. Felix Heron was alone. Alone in the midst of those gay saloons, along which, as he had sought the presence of she royal party, he had actually found it difficult to make his way. How easy it was now ! When there appears to be no space to spare \u2014 no room to move \u2014 how easily more space and more room is made if people please ! That courtly throng did please. And the Earl of Whitcombe, as he slowly walked through the second, or middle, saloon, felt the fashionable and richly-attired crowd melt before him, like snow before sunshine. Heron expected it likewise. He paused a moment, as much as to say, \" I wait for what you may have to say !\" But the calm and dignified bearing of Heron, and peThaps a secret conviction in his own mind that he was most clearly the aggressor, and most abundantly in the wrong, stilled the storm in the royal breast. The King sat down again. The Court circle drew a long breath of relief. Heron bowed again, and still took his sidelong entrance to the folding doors. No one spoke to him. No one looked at him. The great effort was not to see him \u2014 not te know him \u2014 to ignore his very existence. A smile of scornful significance sat en the. !ip_ of Felix Hsron. How superior did ho feel himself, at the moment to the wretched throng feat avoided him\u2014 men"], [54, "48 EDITH HERON. and women who lived upon fee smiles of a King, and who were ready to sink down in despair if fee poor creature who wore fee circlet of royalty did but look askance at them. \" My lord !\" \" Just so. I have seen the King.\" \"Yes \u2014 ye-s; I know you have.\" \" And we have quarrelled.\" \" Good heavens!\" But there was a spirit of mischief and of boyish sarcasm about Felix Heron which, on such an occasion as this, was likely to come into play. He was young. The high spirit of amusement had not been cast out of his soul by the cold world. What need he cire for all these people and th.ir petty, miserable cabals and feelings ? Had he not rank, wealth, and oh ! more than all. had he not love? \" Oh, yes ! we have had quite a disagreement. Pray take my arm, and I will tell you all about it ; and then I am sure you will agree with me that I am quite in fee right, and his Majesty quite in the wrong.\" \" Merciful powers !\" \" Oh !\" \"His Majesty in the wrong! Sir \u2014 my lord! the King can do no wrong!\" \" Oh, that old idea is exploded, yon know, and I am sure when you bear what I have to 6ay, you will go into fee King's Saloon, and remonstrate with him.\" The dear love of his Edith ! How serene was the heart of Felix Heron ! How completely indifferent he was to tho frowns or smiles of the King I But he thought he would extract a little amuse ment from some one ; and who so likely to afford it as my Lord Clackington ? That elderly beau and courtier, of all others, seemed filled with the greatest horror at the Eirl of Whitcombe. No one would have been so ready to wipe the dust from the shoes of the Earl as my Lord Clackington, always provided fee Earl was in favour at Court \" I ?\u2014 I ?\u2014 I remonstrate ?\" \" To be sure.\" \" With the King's Majesty ?\" \" Why not ?\" \" My lord, you are mad \u2014 mad! A dangerous man, my lord ! A very dangerous man \u2014 a Jaco bite!\" Lord Clackington began to think that but one course lay before him, and that was publicly to quarrel with the Eirl of Whitcombe, otherwise who should say how far he might be compromised by even talking to him ? But if he quarrelled wife him, why that would be an answer to all insinuations. Bnt as he was in disgrace, and as it was evident he did not care about it and would take no pains to get out of disgrace, he became, from an ambi tion, quite a terror to my Lord Clackington. Heron guessed this. As he neared the door leading from the second saloon into the outer one, the Eari of Whitcombe saw Lord Clackington quite jammed into a narrow space close to the wall between two pilasters- No doubt the throng of courtiers who had made such haste to avoid him, Heron, had whirled the flimsy old Lord Clackington into his present posi tion. \" A Jacobite, my lord, and a dangerous man !\" \"ReaUy!\" \" Yes, my Lord Whitcombe. I am sorry to come to that conclusion ; but having come to it, I beg, my lord, that we may be strangers \u2014 strangers, my lord \u2014 perfect strangers!\" \" How cruel I\" said Heron. \" Cruel or not, my lord \u2014 if you are a lord \" \"Ah! Indeed!\" He could neither advance nor retreat. A smile played upon the countenance of Heron as he neared the spot Lord Clackington affected to be intently study ing tbe ceiling of the saloon. The ceiling was a painted one. Some of those odd, staring allegorical devices, wife which art used to love to daub the ceilings of palaces and great mansions, were there ; and it appeared by the attention which Lord Clackington bestowed upon it that he was exceedingly anxious to discover its true meaning. \" My lord !\" said Heron. Lord Clackington did not hear. There are none so deaf as those who won't hear. \" I say that if yon are a lord, I beg feat you will not address me.\" \" A highwayman !\" said a voice in the crowd. Felix Heron turned sharply in the direction of the tones, but he could not detect who had spoken. \" Yes, a highwayman, perhaps !\" added Lord Clackington. \" That was his most gracious Majesty's opinion, and I hope that he will hear that snch is likewise the opinion of the most obe dient and grateful of his subjects, Lord Clacking ton! Hem! hem!\" \" And that is really your opinion, my lord?\" \" It is. Thieves I thieves 1 Take care of yonr jewels, yonr purses, and your snuff- boxes, gentle men I Ladies, look to your fans and yonr vinai grettes! Hem! hem!\" Lord Clackington now thought that he had made quite a sensation, and had, oi ce and for all, not only rid himself of fee Eirl of Whitcombe, but had laid the foundation of future high favour wife fee King. Perhaps he had. Bnt his little affair with Felix Heron was not quite over. \"Stop, my lord!\" \"Nay, sir.\" \" One moment, if yon please.\" \" Thieves !\" \"My lord!\" Lord Clackington's long, scraggy neck looked an inch longer. He still studied the ceiling. \" My Lord Clackington !\" No \u2014 there was no response. Felix Heron took hold of the elderly courtier by the arm and shook him. \" My dear Lord Clackington !\" It was impossible to appear to be any longer oblivious of the presence of Felix Heron. Lord Clackington looked down from fee ceiling. \"A \u2014 hem! \u2014 hem! Good evening, my lord! A fine night and a brilliant assembly I Good evening 1\" \" Nay, my lord, yon were so kind, and chatty, and agreeable to me on my arrival here,\" said Heron, \" that I cannot part with yon so abruptly.\" Felix Heron held him by the cuff of his coat \"Oome, come, Mr. \u2014 a \u2014 Highwayman \u2014 I can not afford to lose this diamond snuff-box, even !\" \" Then,\" said Heron, \" I advise you to take good care of it.\""], [55, "49 EDITH HERON. I As he spoke, he snatched the snuff-box wife __e haud from the grasp of Lord Clackington, and with the other he ciught him by the chin, forcing his m?uth open by fee suddenness of fee action ; and before he could be aware of what was about to happen, Heron had dashed fee snuff-box into his mouth. echoing from the saloons, \u2014 \" farewell tor ever! Never again willingly will I set foot within those walls, where reside sycophancy, and lip-service, and treachery!\" The idea now uppermost in the mind of Heron was to go home and inform Edith of all feat had passed at fee Palace, and consult with ber upon the happiest course they could take to establish some home far away in fee quiet country, where fee most distant echo of life in London could not reach them. \" Now, my lord, you can feel oertain your pro perty is safe, and I have the honour and the plea sure of bidding you good night\" Old Lord Clackington made some of the most singular of all singular grimaces that were ever seen at Court, and then danced about in a paroxysm of rage and perplexity. Felix Heron did not pause a moment longer, but left the Palace ; and it was with a sensation of delight feat he felt fee free air of heaven upon his brow. Heron took little heed of the way he went ; he had but to walk up St. James's Street to his own house; but the throng of carriages waiting for the guests of the ball at fee Palace was so great that he had to come to a standstill at the crossing of King Street, to wait an opportunity of getting over fee way, without actually rubbing against the horses' heads. The delay was longer than Heron expected ; \" Farewell for ever!\" he said, as he looked back at fee F\u00bbU .9 aud heard the soft strains of music No. 7 \u2014 Edith Heron."], [56, "50 EDITH HERON. and he thought his best plan wculd be to pass dewn King Street, to look for an opening in fee long string of vehicles, through whjoli he could make his way. There was such an opening between two car riages. \" I think and hope, sir, that this night I have saved your life!\" \" Ah, well ! Do you know me?\" \" Alae, no, sir ?\" \" Well, I am obliged to yon. Good night!\" \" Good m'ght, sir! Pray have a care, for tbat ruffian who attempted to assassinate jou, may have accomplices.\" With a quiet, slow step, the man was moving away, without casting another look at Heron. when the latter called to him, \" Hold! Com back I\" Heron was in the act of darting forward, when he received a blow on the side from some one who was close behind him. Turning quickly, Heron was aware feat the long blade of a sword was close to his arm. At tte moment he could not make out what it did there ; but then he felt certain that an attempt had been made to pass that sword-blade through his body, and that it was only that he had made a sudden movement, which had saved his life. Tbe sword had actually ripped up his apparel, and tbe hilt of it had struck him that blow in fee side feat he had felt \" Yes, sir 1\" \" Could vou imagine feaf'I was so dead to al I gratitude\u2014 \"no utterly destitute of all human feeling as to let you depart in this fashion ?\" \" Alas, sir, I did not know!\" Follow me!

Do not \u2014 do not \" \" Do not what ?\" There was a conrt close behind where Felix Heron had paused for a moment to look for an opening in tbe line of coaches, and at fee mouth of that court he saw two men. One of these men had apparently struck the other to the ground, and he fell himself in the effort The one who was knooked down, however, rose rapidly, and fled down the conrt. \" Flatter this poor sad heart with, perhaps fallacious hopes, good sir.\" \" They will not be fallacious, if all goes well Follow me now, and you shall know moie of me ; and then if I, on knowing more of you, feel thi I I am justified in carrying out my idea, yon will be content\" The other one rose wife seeming difficulty. \" Sir, sir,\" he said to Heron, \" I hope to heaven I was in time ! Are you hurt sir ?\" \" No \u2014 what do you mean ?\" All this had happened with snch rapidity feat Felix Heron, although, as we know, not one readily taken by surprise, was puzzled to account for fee transaction. \" Thank heaven, then, I was in time!\" \" In time for what ?\" CHAPTER XVII. \" To foil an assassin, sir.\" \" Ah, indeed!\" Edith's perplexities increase, and she takf>. a mistaken path oct of them. \" Yee, sir, I was oominj np this court, and I saw a man step suddenly olose up to you, and then retreating a pace or two, he drew a sword that he had beneath his cloak, and made a fWM at you with the most murderous intentions. _ had only time to rush upon him, and force his arm a little on cue side.\" Alas, poor Edith !

For what could they point to bnt a thousand perplexities, snares, and terrors in the time to come, from which it seemed impossible to escape ? How was she to act in order to free herself from the entanglements and perplexities of this most unhappy incident? \" Remember feat I am your brother I\" Could those words ever be forgotten \u2014 joined as they would ever be to the remembrance that that brother was likewise the murderer of Felix Heron's father ? \"On my faith, sister Edith, I do not The lunge with that sword, which, in the excitement and alarm of the moment, I was foolish enough to leave behind, might have been an unlucky one for the old Earl, but it seems it has done one good thing.\" \" What? \u2014 what?

What is to be done\u2014 eh ?\" How was she to escape and preserve her heart at peace among the conflicting emotions which such a state of things produced ?

Would Felix Heron forego his oath to be avenged on the murderer of his father ? Could he forgive, even for her sake, the felon deed whi:h had struck that father low in the days of bis repentance, and at fee moment he was me ditating so much good, so much gentleness, and so much happiness to those who had become sc dear to him ? \" I will tell him aU I\" \"Who?\u2014 who?\" \" Felix \u2014 my husband\u2014 the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" You dare not.\" \"Dare not?\" \"No, I say yon dare not Do you want a hanging in the family? \u2014 or do you want another mm der here in old Whitcombe House\u2014 fee murder of your brother by your husband ?

Or was she to tell him all, and say, \" I leave my brother to jour ven geance ?\" Was she henceforward to lead a life of deceit and duplicity \u2014 affecting at times to join with him, Felix Heron, in regrets, anticipations, and speculations, with regard to who could have been the murderer of his father, while all the time, by a few words, she could dispel fee mystery and at once point to the assassin ? \" Fly ! fly !\" she cried again. \" Fly !

No, no \u2014 not an apparition!\" Edith cast her eyes ronnd the room with a shudder. It seemed to her as if it were just pos sible abe might encounter the mocking, sinister glance of John Tarleton \u2014 her brother. \" Come, come, Edith !\" expostulated Heron. \" I see, I mistook you for a heroine, while your heart fee while was full of fears. Do you know what I bave come to 6ay to you ? It is to tell you I have had enough of Court and town life. I pant for the open country, the woods, streams, plains and hills; and I propose that we go far away, and leave this busy hive of angry passions, called London, to prey upon itself.\" \" Oh, yes ! Far away from \u2014 from \" \" From what, Edith ? What word lingered on your lips ?\" \"From the Court which has dissatisfied you, Felix.\" \" T dare not \u2014 I cannot\" \" Well, be it so. The life I lead distracts me. I will sit down here \u2014 I will chance all. I may as well meet this Earl \u2014 your husband ; and when he passes his sword through my heart there will be an end of John Tarleton, and perhaps all the better.\" Edith sprung to her feet. She assumed an attitude of listening. Every vestige of colour fled from her face. Her hands trembled as she pressed back the tresses of her hair, while every sense seemed con centrated and absorbed in the intense desire to listen to some sound. \"In truth it has. My reception has been of the coldest character; so oold, indeed, that I shall not darken the doors of St. James's again with my shadow. And since I have failed utterly likewise in the two pursuits of my life, London has no charms for me.\" \"Yes, Felix, yes.\" \"Why, Edith, you scarcely seem to know what you say.\" \" Those two pursuits ?\" \"Who knows them so well as you? I strove in vain to discover the real particulars of the fate of my poor mother, and I strove in vain to lay my hand upon the assassin of my father.\" Edith felt faint and sick at heart How easily she could have said, \" The assassin of your father is my brother, and yeu may lay your hand upon him in this room, this night week, at ten o'olock, for he will be here on an errand of robbery and ex tortion !\" \" What is it ?\" \"Hush! hush!\" \" What is it, I say ?\" \" He comes ! He returns I I hear his footstep in the hall ! I hear it upon the stairs !\" \" Perdition take him !\" \" He comes ! \u2014 he comes ! My husband !\" \"Editb, are you certain of what you Bay?\" \" He comes ! I hear his footsteps in the cor ridor!\" John Tarleton rushed towards her, and shook her angrily by the arm. \" Name the hour this night week,\" he whispered in a voice of compressed passion, \u2014 \" name the hour at this night week, in which I may find you alone in this room ; or, by the heaven above us, I will remain here, and confront him and fight him !\" What terrible words would those have been for Edith to ntter ? And yet bow mnch better had she uttered them than have cherished in her heart tbe fearful secret, which, like the serpent in the fable, was to feed upon her breast ! \" At ten,\" gasped Edith. \" Good ! That will do.\" She sunk to fee floor, and where John Tarleton went, and how he managed so abruptly as he did to leave fee room, she did not see, and could not divine. CHAPTER XVIII. JONATHAN WILD COMMENl ES A HUNT FOR A PEERAGE, AND TRIES TO GET RID OF _ TROUBLESOME CUSTOMER. There was a footstep without the door. Quick, bnt calm and equable in its movements. Ah ! how well she knew tbat step. ! ' Felix, Felix ',\" she cried aloud. The exigencies ef our story, and anxieties and calamities which seem impending over Editb, have compelled us for a time to leave Jonathan Wild in The door was opened, and Heron stepped into fee chamber."], [59, "53 EDITH HERON. those chambers at the Temple, where his acquaint ance, fee Bolicitor, had been startled by the first dim outlines of a transaction promising such im portant results. Under ordinary circumstances, ten to one but the professional gentleman would have quickly consigned Jonathan Wild to the care of a couple of constables. \" Well, that's me.\" \" We will make it yon, Mr. Wild.\" \" What a world it is !\" said Wild, as he lifted a glass of Madeira and held it between him and one of the tall wax candles which burnt on the table \u2014 \" what a world it is I Only yesterday, and I was a hnnted fugitive I Last night I was glad to crawl into a vault \u2014 a positive charnel honse \u2014 as a place of iefuge, and now I'm half-way towards being Earl of Whitcombe I\" \" One moment,\" said the lawyer. \"WeU?\" Bnt now what a precious article he was ! No diamond to be swathed in cotton and kept in tbe secret drawer of some strong cabinet could have appeared to that attorney so well worth the preservation and care he could bestow on it as Jonathan Wild. A long sleep considerably refreshed fee thief taker. Some judicious feeding likewise, unaccompanied by those strong stimulating potations which Jona than Wild's own judgment told him might as well be dispensed with, made him quite a new man. He had been sorely shaken, battered, and bruised, of course. Moreover, he had received a pistol-shot in his shoulder. But no bones were broken, and the iron frame and iron constitution of Jonathan Wild triumphed over amultitude of small injuries, which \u2014 although, in consequence of happening all together, they prostrated him for a time \u2014 yet appeared to get well all together, and to leave him much in his usual condition. \" A thought disturbs me.\" \" And what may that be?\" \" This Lord Warringdale.\" \" What of him ? In no case can he be a pre tender to the title. If we cannot substantiate onr claim and make good our case, why Felix Heron, the highwayman, holds on ; an.d that man who, for distinction's sake, is still called Lord Warringdale, is jostled out of it Is he not ?\" \" Yes ; but I know of no man who is likely to be more troublesome.\" \" That's true.\" \" I know of no man who is likely to hinder us more ; for, you see, he will either do his best to spoil our plan, or he will want snch a share of its success \" \"Hang his wants! I can't give anymore t\u00bb anybody. It's quite enough if I give you a third of everything.\" \" A third, Mr. Wild ? You said half.\" \"Did I? Then I'll be a man of my word. Whatever I say or think, you may depend I will try to do.\" \" I sever had fee slightest doubt about it; but if I were you now, Mr. Wild \u2014 if I were just in your position \u2014 if I had your prospects and your objects in view \u2014 I think I should feel inclined lo get rid of Lord Warringdale.\" \"Get rid of Lord Warringdale? You mean choke him off ?\" It was rather late on tte same evening of the day on which Jonathan Wild had made his way to fee chambers in the Temple, that he sat with his friend tte attorney by fee cheerful blaze of a good fire. The professional man had put a veto upon brandy, and Wild was \u2014 with sundry wry faces, for he thought it poor drink \u2014 sipping some Ma deira. It would be difficult to say what were the sensa tions and feelings of those two men towards each other. Perhaps, deep in their inmost hearts, their notions and conclusions were very much alike. \"Well, choke is a kind of a \u2014 a sort of word that means a good deal\" \" Look you now !\" said Wild, as he tossed off tbe glass of Madeira, and made an ugly face as he did so, \u2014 \" look you now. Under no circumstances whatever can that fellow Warringdale be of the slightest use to me or to anybody else- He has' not the courage to be an ordinary villain, or to assist one in putting a knife into a fellow in the dark; he has no money, and never will have any. His game's up ; it would really be a charity to kill him.\" Each meant to make use of the other as far as it was needful and useful so to do, and then but one word was wanted to express the idea which lurked at the bottom of each heart Murder ! That was fee word Jonathan Wild was not deceived by tte assumed frank and open bearing of the attorney. The attorney was not deceived by Jonathan Wild's offer of thirty thousand a-year from the estates of Whitcombe, provided he could get pos session of them. \" We ought to be charitable, Mr. Wild ; it is one of the cardinal virtues\" \"Ho! ho!\" But they both knew that, if success was to be attained in the enterprise which loomed in the future, it was much more likely to be accomplished by their united exertions than individually. At a certain point of that success would come the struggle \u2014 a struggle of life and death. Wild was speaking. \" Now, you see,\" he said \u2014 \" you see how plain and simple the whole affair is. By the failure of the elder branch of the Whitcombe family to pre sent a male heir to the title and estates \u2014 a failure which, it appears, was complete at tbe death of the grandfather of this highwayman, Felix Heron, who now calls himBelf Earl of Whitcombe \u2014 the true heir to tbe titles, dignities, and properties, is to be looked for in the living representative of the younger branch.\" \" Just so.\" Wild laughed in his usual startling manner, subsiding into that sudden gravity which always had such an effect upon his hearers. \" Where is he ?\" said tte lawyer. \" I told you where he was. He is waiting for me in that long disused vault of tte Whitcombee in Westminster Abbey.\" \" Think you he is waiting still?\" \" He will be afraid to move ; he is there, you may depend upon it\" \" It's a dark night There is a little rain too. Now, if I were you, Mr. Wild, I would go and see him; and \u2014 as he certainly claims some affinity to the Whitcombe family\u2014 if you were to tako measures so that he remained in that ancient vault, it would not be amiss.\" \" What a roundabout fellow yon are !\" sai i Wild ; \" but I suppose that's your business. Why"], [60, "54 EDITH rr___ON. don't you say at once that you think Pd better go and kill him ?\" \" Hem ! Mind, I don't advise anything of fee sort I only Bay if you conld persuade him to stay in the family vault of the Whit;ombes, I think \u2014 looking upon it as step number one in fee whole transaction \u2014 it would be no bad thing.\" Wild rose, and looked through the dingy win dows of the chambers into the black night beyond. There was no moon \u2014 there were no stars. A puffing wind was blowing from the river. Flashes of light now fell upon fee murky glass of the window. \" A black night,\" muttered Wild. \" Just the one for \" Westminster was then as dirty as it is now, and that is saying a great deal The temptations to any one to be about, unless under the pressure of some powerful motives, was slight indc ed, so feat Wild was not at all surprised to reaoh the corner of the Abbey, by Henry the Seventh's Chapel, without a single soul obstruct ing him. A watchman was slumbering in his watch-box in the Palace Yard. Another was creeping along Parliament Street with the news feat it was \" past eleven o'clock, and a clondy night\" \"All right!\" said Wild, as he began to climb one of the decayed old buttresses The task was easy. Wild was soon on the ledge of one of the windows. \"For what?\" \" A walk to Westminster Abbey.\" \" Come on, then.\" \"I? I, say you?\" \"And why not? Hark you, my friend \u2014 yon are to share and share alike in the plunder, if plunder there be in this affair, which we mean to set about in regard to fee earldom and estates of Whitcombe, and my name is not Jonathan Wild if I don't make you share in everything else.\" \" Then, Mr Wild, I decline.\" \" You decline ?\" Since the great riots of London, the windows of the Abbey had for the most part had wire-work framed over them on the outside. This window to which Wild clambered was bo defended. But the wire was rusted until it was as fine and as fragile as a spider's web. It gave way and orumbled down at a touch. The leaden frame of fee window was a greater obstacle, but it was overcome. Jonathan Wild was in fee Abbey. He let him self down on to the tomb of a Knight Templar. Once within tte building, Jonathan had no difficulty in finding his way to the chapel with the tomb and the four kneeling figures. The silence was profound. Wild pressed on the stone in the wall. \"Hist! Hist! I am here, my Lord Warring dale. I am here I Hist ! Don't you hear me ?\" A groan came from the vault \" Speak !\" said Wild \" I famish \u2014 I starve !\" \" I do. What is in my line I will do ; but what is out of it I will not attempt. I told you as much once before, and I tell it to you now again I can, npon what is contained in that paper you have brought from tte iron casket in the vaults at Westminster Abbey, so arrange papers, letters, old tombstones and documents, that I can make any one I please represent the younger branch of the house of Whitcombe \u2014 always provi led some real representative does not appear ; but fee rough work which yon are accustomed to, Mr. Wild, I cannot do.\" It was the voice of Lord Warringdale. \"Come out, then\u2014 all's right. There is no danger now. I could not get to you sooner. Come out !\" \" Stay where you are, then. I cannot deny but there is reason in what you say.\" Jonathan Wild put on an ample great-coat which belonged to the lawyer, and which, hanging on a hook behind the door, he took possession of without the ceremony even of asking its owner's leave, and then with a nod to fee lawyer he left fee chambers. \" Oh, thank heaven ! At last I shall be released from this living tomb!\" \" Of course you will.\" Jonathan Wild drew his hanger. He listened wife all his ears \u2014 he bent forward and strove to pierce tte obscurity of the narrow staircase below the black opening of the vault \" Where are you ?\" \" I am here,\" replied Warringdale. Wild stretched forward his left hand, and felt the opposition of a soft body. \" Take that, then !\" he said. There was an awful swinging blow of the hanger, \u2014 a groan, and Wild heard Lord Warring dale fall headlong down fee stone steps. \" I should say that will do!\" said Wild, as he replaced the blue slaty stone on the surface of the wall. \" Good-night, my Lord Warringdale.\" It was Jonathan Wild's firm intention to put out of the way his old acquaintance, Lord Warring dale, for he fully felt the force of what the lawyer had said \u2014 that Lord Warringdale was likely to be a great otstac e in the way of success in their plans. Jonathan made his way to a court at fee back of fee Strand, near to Temple Bar, and at a miserable old shop there, which seemed to sell everything, he bought a hanger, such as in the days of his pride and prosperity, when he had a troop of myrmidons at his heels, he was in the habit of nsing very freely upon tte head of any one who disputed bis authority. Thus armed, he made his way to the Abbey. Jonathan Wild was not quite sure in regard to tte best way of getting into the sacred building, bat he thought he could make his way as he had done before throngh any of the windows, provided he could scramble up to one. That, to a man like Wild, would not be a very difficult matter, by the foot-bold he would obtain on some one or other of fee old decayed buttresses of fee edifice. CHAPTER XIX. EDITH KEEPS HER SECRET, AND FELIX. HERON FINDS HIS ENEMIES ACTIVE AGAINST HIM. It was juet one week after the events recorded as taking place on the night of fee Court ball at St James's, that two men attired in travelling capes made slowly up the hill which leads from Blackheath to the well-known Castle of Severn droog. The night was peculiarly favourable to him. The darkness was excessive. The drizzling rain had extinguished many of Hie wretched oil-lamps in the street Those two men were so cares ally enveloped in"], [61, "55 EDITH HERON. cloaks, fee collars of which almost met the broad slapping brims of their hats, that had the shadows of the evening not lent the aid of their obscurity to disguise all objects, their recognition would have been difficult \" Halt !\" said fee more taciturn of the two horse- men. \"Halt, indeed!\" said the other; \"I think it is time - \" It is time.\" Tbey rode good horses, and it was evident feat those horses had not travelled far, by the light and easy manner in which they breasted fee hill. The road was steep. Loose pebbles made it worse, too, than it really was ; and but that those two horses were so fresh and lively, they might bave made that ascent one of some peril to their mysterious-looking riders. Deep shadows from the old trees which grew iu tte plantations on each side of the way lent a funeieal gloom to the place. Dimly the tower ef the castle showed itself against the night-clouds One of the horsemen spoke. \" What a strange whi__,'\" he eaid, \"it was of some one to build what looks like an old feudal residence upon this hill !\" \" Yes ; when every step one's horse takes is as if it were putting its feet down some fathomless abyss.\" \" Here is a gate through which we can piss\" \" Good !\" The horseman, who had striven, either from a na'ural garrulity, or to fiud a relief from bis own fears, to keep up a conversation with his gloomy and morose companion, now dismounted With the bridle of his steed over his arm, be strove to find out the gate which the other had mentioned.. \u2022' One must feel one's way,\" he said. \" Let me go first,\" said the other. \" Ay, do. You, doubtless, will find the way better than I shall.\" \" I have been here before.\" \" It was a whim of an Earl of Whitcombe,\" replied the other in low, muttered tones \" So I have heard \u2014 bo I have heard.\" \" Often ?\" \" It matters not \u2014 it matters not Let but the day come when I look upon the place as a master, and surely the cloud feat hangs upon my spirits will fly.\" The gate was fast \" Provoking !\" added fee taciturn man. \" The gate is fast. We must have a light\" \"In a moment.\" \" You have heard truly.\" \u25a0 And who resides here now ?\" \" Who think yon ?\" \" Nay, how can I guess ?\" \" The dead \u2014 the owls and the bats \u2014 and now and then, in all probability, a stray fox.\" \" Pleasant company !\" \" Very 1\" It was evident that the man who spoke with so much bitterness and said so few words was not seeking at that moment to carry on a conversation wife his companion, and that he was in one of those moody discontented humours in which everything is an annoyance and an offence. His companion lapsed into silence. Nothing then was heaid for some time but the tramp of the horses' feet Or a loose stone which rolled and bounded down the bill. \" Be careful. A light on this eminence will show for a mile \" \" It may ; but I don't think feat on that account any one will be tempted to oome up here to see what is the cause of it ; and, if they should, why, I fancy it will be the worse for them.\" \" Much the worse.\" A lighted match in another mcment sent a dim radiance about it ; and with some trouble a small hand- lantern was lit. The gate was fastened by a rusty chain ; bnt so dilapidated altogether was gate and fastening, that there was no difficulty in lifting it bodily off its hinges This was done. Or the sighing of the night-wind among fee trees. \"Now follow me,\" said fee complaining, gloomy man ; \" I will take fee lantern, and you can lead both the horses.\" Or the grating, squeaking noise of an old weather vane on one of the turrets of the old castellated mansion. It must be premised that Blackheath and Shooter's Hill, at fee period of fee events we are recording, were very different places to what they tire now. \" Agreed. Do you know what yon look like?\" \" No,\" replied the other firmly. \" Don't be mak ing invidious remarks to me, I beg of you.\" \" Nay, don't you be in a passion about nothing. I was only going to say that, as I could see no thing I at fee lantern, it seemed like following a will-o'-the-wisp.\" \" Pshaw I Pshaw !\" Blackheath was of much larger extent than at present, when it has been encroached upon by suburban villas on all sides. Next to Hounslow Heath, it was fee well-known resort of highwayman, and there were periods of panic when no carriage would venture across the heath without an escort Shooter's Hill was positively a dreary plaoe, withont a house er the semblance of one upon it A ruinous hut, called the Lodge, was close to fee foot of it ; but a foul murder that had been committed in it, had caused it to be deserted ; and in feat strange way feat human habitations so soon fall to pieces, when they are deserted by human kind, this hut was but a mass of ruins By the time the two horsemen we have men tioned reached one of fee entrances to fee woody grounds around the castle, the night seemed to have dropped down upon the earth with double dork ness. The vegetation had been allowed, in fee planta tion where they were, to obey so entirely its own instincts, that the narrow path in which they were was at places almost blocked up by the wild rose and long branches of fee bramble. These, mingled with the nut-bushes, made np snch a mass of intermingled branches, that fee man with the lantern at times had literally to fight his way through the obstruction. The horses at times, too, struck and plunged from the recoiling prickly shoots of fee brambles, so that it was wit h eome difficulty they were held ; and but that, in consequence of fee thickness of fee vegetation, it was out of their pow9r to swerve either to fee right or to the left, they certainly would not have been kept in fee path on which they were wished to proceed. Literally, it became difficult to see yonr hand before your face."], [62, "56 EDITH HERON, The immobility of that cold, calm, white f.n-<> was enough to make any one shudder who looked at it ; and the companion of this masked man cei tainly did not Beem to regard fee face with pleasant sensations. But the difficulties of the way ceased sud- denly. The plantation ended abruptly. There was a small lawn, with, in the centre of it, a gigantio walnut tree. Against the night sky the lowering top of this old tree could be seen distinctly. Tbe man who carried the lantern paused. \" Thank the fates !\" said the other ; \"we are so far quit of this tangle.\" \" If we are to talk freely,\" he said, \" remove tbat disguise from your features.\" \" Wherefore ?\" \"Just because it is\u2014 it is \u2014 well, I was going to say ugly, but it is worse than that.\" \"You know now what effect I am likely to have npon fee timid.\" \" In truth I do. Does not the town ring with the exploits of the ' White Highwayman of Houns low Heath,' as he is called.\" \" As I am called.\" \"What tangle?\" \" Come \u2014 come ! Yon speak as if I were a mad dog.\" \" I am not in a temper to speak at all.\" \" So I should say.\" \" Peace \u2014 oh, peace !\" \" Well, well ! \u2014 things may get better 1\" \" They cannot, I fear; but I can, I fanoy, still look forward to one thing.\" \" An !\u2014 and that?\" \" Yes ; I see that it is you. Now, therefore, as you don't want to stop me on the road, or to pro duce any effect upon me by the cold, white, death* like mask, I would much rather you removed it\" \" Be it so, Le Jeuse.\" \"Hush! Hush!\" \" You know what it is.\" \" I can guess.\" \" Ha ! ha !\u2014 yon can guess ! Revenge! it is re venge !\" \" An expensive passion !\" \" No doubt\u2014 no doubt ! But if it costs me my life \u2014 if it cost me ten lives, and I had them all to give, one after the other, they should be freely given !\" \" There is no disputing about tastes,\" said fee other, carelessly. \" And so this is the castle?\" \"it is \u2014 it is.\" \" Why hush ?\" \" Don't call me Le Jeune, I beg of you. When I was the private secretary of the late Bishop of Worcester, it was all very well for me to be known by the name of Le Jeune ; but I don't want that name to be so much as whispered to fee winds of heaven now.\" The masked man took off the white mask that so effectually disguised him. It was tte face of none other than Lord War ringdale that showed itself beneath that hideout covering. And now those two men stood face to face to each other. The secretary of the poor murdered Bishop of Worcester and the murderer ! Warringdale was pale, and there was a look of age and envy upon his face- But that face was human, and it was a relief from the cold, stony look of the dead white mask. \"Well,' said Lord Warringdale, \"what news have you for me?\" \"But little!\" The man who carried the lantern had paused at tbe porch of the old building, and turning to wards his companion, he held up the lantern so that it shed a broken ray around it npon sur rounding objects. \" Tie up the horses to the iron-work here,\" he said. \" There is no rain, and they will come to no harm in the night air.\" \" Not a bit ; they are quite cool.\" \" Come in.\" \" I follow you.\" The man with the lantern took from under a \"And that little?\" stone close to a low close arched door a key, which was there hidden in a cavity feat no. doubt had been made for it, and opened the door. The hall into which they made their way had a damp, neglected odour about it \" * lively place this !\" -' What matter ?\" \" Well, there is something amiss in fee house hold at Whitcombe House.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes. You know that the capital plan by which you and I contriv.d that I should be intro duced to the favourable notice of Felix Heron, now Earl of Whitcombe, fully succeeded.\" \" It did. I assailed him on that night of the ball at St James's Palace, at the entrance of the court in King Street; and you no doubt performed your task well in making him believe that yon had saved his life \" \" Well, perhaps it suits all the better on that account\" \" It does\" The man with the lantern strode across the hall, and opened a door to the right hand. He held up the lantern for his companion, who was a few paces behind him, to see his way, and then they both entered an apartment, fee air of which had, in truth, a very different feel from lhat of the hall. This difference of feel arose from smouldering wood and turf that was on the hearth. \" Oh, yes ! He is one of the most \u2014 most\u2014 what shall I say ?\u2014 credulously grateful men I ever met with.\" Lord Warringdale made a gesture of impatience. \" In fact,\" added Le Jeune, without fee least blush of shame upon his face, \u2014 \"in fact ne is just the sort of perse n to be played upon by two .uch villains as we are,\" \" This is an improvement,\" said the loquacious mau. \" It may be so,\" replied the other. As he spoke, he placed the lantern npon the table ; and then, as in that more confined space the light did its duty more effectually, a mask might have been seen on fee face of the taciturn man who had led fee way to the castle on Shooter's Hill. \" You speak plainly.\" \" It saves time. \" Well, well ! I have ne objection. But now tell me, what is tbat yon spoke of in connexion with that arch villain, Jonathan Wild ?\" ' It's a strange story, indeed There is a man \u2014 half a man and half a boy \u2014 who is a kind of clerk lo an attorney in the Temple, of the name of Boom.

There were deep hollows to be avoided, and fee furze bushes themselves would be no slight obsta cles to the progress o! any vehicle. Hence this carriage, although it had entered upon the heath full ten minutes, had not proceeded above a third of its width. \" Truly, my Lord Warringdale, yon are a pat tern to all knights of tte road !\" \" I have not a gang of desperadoes at my back, as Felix Heron had when he took to life on the road. I hunt alone. I have bat two arms to fight wife.\" \" Oh, I applaud your caution. Well, I suppose you have nothing else to say to me at present?\" Lord Warringdale was busy settling the prim ing in fe . pans of a pair of pistols, and as he strode to the door of the room he said, \" Nothing, except that I wish you still to keep your place about Felix Heron, and to let ise know whatever \u00bb{ interest takes place in Wnitecmbe House.\" \" There is a mystery.\" \" What is it ? What mystery ? You have be fore hinted at it. What is it ?

But it does baffle me; for the mystery is connected in some way wife fee fair Edith.\" There was ample time for Lord Warringdale, if he were so minded, to make an attack upon it ; and by the alacrity with which he mounted his horse it would seem as if he had such an intention. Le Jenne had no idea of mixing himself np in any euch transaction jnst then That arch villain was well situated as tte private secretary of the unsuspecting and gallant Felix Heion, Earl of Whitcombe ; so he saw no necessity for risking his position by engaging as an amateur highwayman.

But it was too late. \" Good sport to night !\" he muttered. \" Who knows but 1 shall have the pleasure of calling ont 'Stand and deliver!' to some cne whom I know? Ha, ha!\" The vehiole rolled on. The one person who was in it might have been supposed to be asleep, so still was he, as he sat far back iu the carriage, enveloped in a cloak. Lord Warringdale let the carriage get about a quarter of a mile in advance of him, and then he set spurs to his horse, aud was after it at speed. That was his plan. The coachman and the footman would hear the galloping of a horse after them, and the sound w ould at once awaken all their fears, which no doubt were active upon fee subject of the \" White Highwayman \" \" Halt, ho ! Halt, ho !\" Lord Warringdale cried out these orders in a strange hollow voice, which he made sound some what unearthly, by putting his hand in a hollow form before his mouth. Oh, fatal words \u2014 too late ! Lord Warringdale was soon on tte slope of the hill from the castle, and Le Jeune was as seon on his route to London again. The horse which Warringdale rode was a powerful, dark-coloured animal, upon the strength and endurance of which he could depend ; and as he trotted slowly down on to the heath in a slant line, eo as to intercept the carriage, he carefully adjusted the white mask to his face, which gave tim so hideous an aspect, and which had earned fir him fee soubriquet of fee \" White Highway man.\" A very few weeks had elapsed since Lord War ringdale had taken to this mode of Use ; but during that time, short as it was, he had managed to earn for himself a very unenviable reputation. Not only had he committed some robberies on Blackheath, which had been talked of, but a couple of murders were likewise laid to the charge of fee \" White Haywayman.\" Warringdale was not fee man who was likely to be very scrupulous about taking a human life. Then he fired one of his holster pistols The coach stopped at once. \" Good Lord I\" said fee coachman, \"we are dead men.\" \" Murder I murder I\" said the footman. The gentleman inside the vehicle let down the front glass. \"Are you hit, Samuel?\" he said calmly to the coachman \" No, no, my lord ! I\u2014 I\u2014 think not\" \"You would be eure to know if you wern. Ask John if he is hit\" By the lights that slashed from the carriage, and the speed at which it went, Warringdale came to the conclusion that it belonged to seme person of distinction, and, consequently, his booty was likely to be considerable. \" John, John, are \u2014 are you hit, my lord wants to know?\" He loosened tte pistols in the holsters of his saddle, and, touching the horse wife fee spurs, he reached the heath at a trot \" Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! \u2014 I think I am.\" \" Drive on,\" said the gentleman \" If 3o\u2014 a only thinks he is hit, it is no matter \u2014 Uri . _, on.\" There was a hollo v portion of the road, where the natural drainage of the wide common had pro duced a pond ; and the road for carriages, rongh and bad as it was, wound round the right of this pond. The carriage, by going at a greater speed than Lord Warringdale calculated, would have got past this favourable spot for attack if he, Warringdale, had not made his horse go throngh the pond. That, however, he did not hesitate to do. Theie was one precaution, however, which Warringdale never neglected when he made an attack on any one on the road He always trotted past the vehicle first, in order that he might see, as he passed it, who was inside it \" Yes, my lord.\" The horses had ju .t began to move on aga_u, when the \" White Highwayman \" dashed np to fee door of the carriage, and resting the banv1 \u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\" % pistol upon tte wiudo v ledge, he said in a n.vw< _ assumed voice, \" Death or plunder! Your money or your life ! Be prudent sir, and live a little poorer, rather than force me to take tte life CW. _ more valuable than riches.\" \" Oh, indeed !\" said fee gentleman. \" Stop, Samuel, stop!\" Lord Warringdale nttered a cry of terror. The gentleman in the carriage had with a rapid movement snatched the pistol from his hand, and turned the muzzle of it full upon him But it was not so much tbat unexpected move ment feat horrified Lord Warringdale, as the voice and aspect of the gentleman who was alone in that carriage. Who could know him so well as he, War ringdale ? It was no other than Fe'ix Heron, the Earl of Whitcombe ! It may be considered a disparagement to his courage, but it was certainly none to his prurience, that when he saw more than one man in a car riage he was in the habit of letting tbat pass free. Ladies were his favourite game. But, still, he would not hesitate to attack one traveller, for he had found that the coachman and footman of the carriage were generaUy in too great a fright to lend asy assistance to their master. If by any means Warringdale could at that moment have induced Blackheath to open just beneath his horse's feet, and swallow him up for a time, be would have endured tte inconvenience Terror was in ev_>ry line of his face, if Felix Heron could only have seen it. But it was hidden by tte white mask \"If you attempt. to move hand or foot,\" said the Eail ot Whitcotnhe, \" T will shoot you.\" For well did Warringdale know those tones, so calm, so resolute, so truthful. Too weU did he In pursuance then, of this prudent line of con dnct, Warringdale dashed through the pond, so that he was on higher ground than the carriage, and then he drew up as it passed him. All was well. But one person Bat in the vehicle.

A touch at the trigger would send a bullet through him, and he shook as he sat npon his saddle with his head andbody bentdown, as he had stooped to look into the coach. \" Now, sir !\" said Heron. \" What do you want with me?\" on. That pause was very nearly fatal to Felix Heron. Lord Warringdale, when he had caused his horse to scramble through the pond, turned in his saddle to cast a glance back at the coach. He had fully expected to see th. distance be tween himself and it much greater than it was, Bi'nce he bad naturally supposed the coach would have gone on its way as soon as he no longer op posed its progress. But it was stationary. Felix Heron was for fee instant in deep thought, asking himself where and under what circum stances he had heard some of the tones of the voice of fee \" White Highwayman.\" Lord Warringdale tried to speak, but his tongue refused him utterance. \" I say, sir, what do you want with me ?\" \" I\u2014 I\u2014 nothing !\" \" Nothing ? And yet you fire at my servants, and stop my carriage on the high road !\" \"Nothing with you, my Lord of Whitcombe.\" \" Ob, yon know me !\" There was a something in fee tone of the voice of Warringdale, although he spoke in disguised accents, which struck upon the ears of Heron with a certain familiarity, and he became curious to know who it was that stopped him upon lhat heatb. \" Let me go 1\" said Warringdale, still speaking in the feigned voice. \" Let me go ! Hawks should not prey upon hawks !\" \"What do you mean, fellow ?\" \" You, too, have been upon the road.\" \" Ah ! Since yon know so much, it is only just and proper that we should be equal in that respect Who are you ?\" \"Forbear!\" Then it was that out of that delay, so trivial and so short Lord Warringdale evoked an idea. Might not a lucky shot rid him at once and for ever of Felix Heron ? He did not stop to ask himself what good it would now do him to take the life of his half brother. He did not ask himself if feat act would bring him one inch nearer to fee Earldom of Whit combe. All he thought of was the savage pleasure of being able to lodge a bullet in the brain of Heron- He turned completely round, and fired. From the darkness of that part of the heath where he was, the bright lamps of the carriage enabled him to see exceUently his mark. There was a crashing sound, mingling with fee report of the pistol. The bullet had gone thrcugh the panels of the carriage, and if it avoided fee head of FeUx Heron, it must have done eo with very little space to spare. \" Oh, nonsense ! Declare to me who and what you are, and I may let you go.\" \"You let\u2014 me\u2014 go?\" \" Yes. You have heard, no doubt, the old story of the soldier who caught a Tar. ar? WeU, my friend, whoever you are, you have achieved the same result!\" \" Felix Heron, now Earl of Whitcombe,\" said Warringdale, humbly, \" I pray you to let me go ! Fad I known beforehand that this carriage was yours, and that you occupied it, no voice of mine would have hindered its progress. By the memory of what yon once were yourself \u2014 the same that I am now \u2014 I pray you to let me go !\" \" Yon li,. sir !\" - Nay, my lord, report says that you were a knight of tte road 1\" \" Did report 6ay that I was a coward, sir ?\" \u2022\u2022 No \u2014 no!\" But it did so, for all that FeUx Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, was not to die by a chance and felon shot on Blackheath. The bullet passed through the panel of tte coach so closely to him that he could feel the pas sage of it across his eyes. Then it lodged in the padding and lining of thc carriage on the opposite side. \" The villain !\" exclaimed Heron. \" That was a cowardly shot, and meant to be a murderous one !\" \" And yet you are one !\" Lord Warringdale shook again in his saddle. \" i sm not well !\" Heron had still the other pistol which he had so dexterously wrenched from the hand of Lord Warringdale, and, with it in his grasp, he dashed open the coach door and sprung out upon the heath '\u2022 Not well ! How dare you come on to the road to frighten old people, and women and children ? Tell me, sir \u2014 have you stopped or robbed any one t. is night?\" \" No ; on my faith, no I\" \"Go, then, and take my contempt with you !\" Felix Heron leant back in the carriage ; and the moment Lord Warringdale really found him self at liberty to be off, he turned his horse's head, and dashed back into the pond. \" Wait here,\" he said to the servants. \" Wait here until my return. Or, no, no ! Go on \u2014 it will be better and safer \u2014 go on to the Earl of Bridge water's. You know his new house at Charlton i\" \" Yes, my lord.\" \" On with you, then !\" Heron himself shut the door of the carriage, and it went its way. The fact was, that this expedition of Felix Heron's was to visit his dear friend the Earl of Bridgewater, who was -laying at a mansion at Charlton, just across Blackheath, which was one of tue properties of his family ; and hence, by that somewhat rare accident, Heron had fallen in tte way of the \" White Highwayman,\" his most un worthy half-brother, Lord Warringdale. Warringdale did not pause to look after his shot CHAPTER XXI. A DASTARDLY SHOT, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES \u2014 THE EARL OF WHITCOMBE MEETS WITH AN ADVENTURE Dt THE CASTLE ON SHOOTERS HILL. The coachman of tbe Earl of Whitcombe had been too much alarmed at the whole of the proceedings to take tte immediate Ovantage that he might It might and it might not, have done fee u_w cutiou he wished."], [67, "EDITH HERON. 61 If it did not, there was too mnch danger to him in th? inquiry. If it had hit Felix Heron, he thought he should soon know ; for in snch a case it would be a cer tainty that the carriage would be turned towards London again. That was a fact that could be as easily ascer tained at some distance from the spot of the en counter as close at band. Therefore was it that, simultaneously noon fee discharge of that treacherous shot, Lord War ringdale spurred his horse to a half gaUop across the heath. his post on the side of tte hill a Uttle distance from the heath, so toat on that vantage-ground he could command a view over the whole wide ex panse of waste land before him. If, then, he saw booty was to be got by a descent on to the heath, he was ready to do so. If, on tte contrary, he saw, or fancied he saw, danger approaching, five minutes' time would place him in tte security of Severndrog Castle. Warringdale therefore paused now in the spot where he was in the habit of taking his stand on fee hUl. That spot was close to a group of elm trees of great height and girth, which covered that portion of the\" road up the side of fee hiU with a profound gloom. Warringdale began to reload the pistols he had discharged. They consisted of one of his holster or saddle pistols, and one of a pair feat he carried in his pockets. The other holster pistol he had perforce left in tte possession of the Earl of Whitcombe. \" Confusion seize him!\" muttered Warringdale, to himself ; \" that I should meet my worst foe on earth here, upon fee heath, and feat he, of all persons, should defy me, and escape me. Ob, feat I could get another shot at him !\" If Lord Warringdale had but known it, he was in a better position to get another shot at Felix Heron than before. He went in the direction of his hiding-place on Shooter's HiU. After in this way placing abont half a mile between himseU and the road over the heath, Warringdale paused and looked back. The carriage, which he could see weU on ac count of its lamps, was gradually pursuing its journey over the heath towards fee viUage of Charlton. \" I have missed him !\" cried Warringdale. \" He has the luck of the fiend as weU as his own ! I have surely missed him !\" If anything could confirm this impression, it was the deliberate way in which the coach pro ceeded. There was no hurry \u2014 no excitement \u2014 about fee pace of the horses whatever. \" Curses on him !\" muttered Warringdale, \u2014 \" that's his way ! He takes a shot, which may have passed within an inch of his brain, as a matter of no moment\" The Earl of Whitcombe had made his way right across the heath, and was at the foot of Shooter's Hill. Little did Lord Warringdale imagine that at that very instant of time fee Earl of Whitcombe was slowly making his way on foot, and in tho darkness, over the heath towards him. Had he had fee least suspicion of that fact, Lord Warringdale would not have quietly dis mounted, as he now did, to shorten one of his stirrup-leathers which had slipped. Felix Heron, as soon as the coach had driven off, had stood profoundly still to listen. The regular beat of the horses' feet let him soon know in which direction he was to follow the \" White Highwayman.\" Then he paused to listen. The horse which Warringdale rode was getting impatient of delay, for a cold wind swept across the hill. The creature stamped fretfuUy with one of its fore feet repeatedly Some loose stones were displaced, and rolled clattering down fee hill, towards where J'\u00e6iix Heron was waiting to listen. Those sounds were conclusive. \" He is there !\" said Heron. He then commenced the ascent of ine .ill, keeping in the dark shadows of the trees and bushes on the right hand as he did so \" Now,\" thought Heron, \" I shaU find out who you really are.\" The Earl of Whitcombe had scarcely made it's remark to himself, when the propriety of pausing and concealing himself in the shadowy vegetation by the side of the wood was manifest A horseman came at speed over the heath. The horseman was evidently making for the biU, and might possibly enough be a comrade of the \" White Highwayman.\" FeUx Heron then conld hear a scuffling noise, as of horse's feet on the hill-side. There was a feeling of curiosity, mingled with indignation, in tte mind of Heron, which induced him, amid the darkness of that night to make his way alone and on foot over Blackheath in pursuit of an armed and mounted man. A man, too, who, for aU he knew to the con trary, might have associates, whose numbers he would find it impossible to contend with. But the long residence of Felix Heron in Epping Forest had made the night almost as fami liar to him as the day, and he took his route over the heath with a confident step that few persons in the darkness would have ventured on. Lord Warringdale had paused to dismount and put that stirrup-leather right, at fee foot of Shooter's Hill. Lord Warringdale, not knowing who this horseman could be who was arriving, was taking up a secure position in a leafy covert, where he could hide and aUow any one to pass him, if he chose. That situation gave him a great advantage, for there was earth instead of sky behind him, so that he was not seen by Felix Heron as a darker object against the night clouds, which would assuredly, with fee keen perception of Heron, have been the case, had he been on fee open heath. But the horseman came to seek him purposely ; and, after passing within twenty feet of Felix Heron, he caUed out, \"Ho, there! \u2014 ho! Whoop and away 1 Any kites here ?\" FeUx Heron started. Then Warringdale mounted again, and pro ceeded a short distance np fee hill. FeUx Heron heard the sound of the horse's feet on the loose stony road. It was tte custom of Warringdale, since he had assumed the character of a highwayman, to take Surely he knew that voite. Surely it was familiar to him, although he had never heard it in such loud tones before. Was it or was it not, the voice of that man whom he had taken into Whitcombe House as his secretary, on account of tte presumption that he had intei^"], [68, "62 EDITH HERON. posed to save his life on fee night of the Court ball? Warringdale did not wish his villanous asso ciate, Le Jenne, to go off upon bad terms with him. Heron was right. It was the voice of Le Jenne that he heard, and \" Hold ! hold !\" he cried. \" I do thank yon \u2014 I do thank you ; but my mind was full of alarm, at I scarcely know what I will see yon in town at two o'clock to-morrow.\" yet he could hardly beUeve his own senses. \" Hoy ! \u2014 hoy I Any kites here ?\" Yes, they were fee exact tones. \" What bird ?\" said another voice. \"Do bo. Good night!\" \" Good night !\" Le Jeune gaUopped away. \" Le Jeune ? Le Jeune ?\" repeated Felix Heron to himself. \" Where is it that I have surely heard that name before? It sounds very familiar to me.\" Herou began to think feat his senses were playing him some tricks, for now that Lord War ringdale spoke in his own tones he was recognised at once. \" The villain Warringdale !\" said Heron, to him self. \" How very strange that I should not have known the trick of his voice upon the heath, at once !\" There can be very little doubt but that Heron had heard the name at the Bishop of Worcester's ; but many important events had chased it from bis memory, unlil it turned up again here on Shooter's Hill. Lord Warringdale, being now satisfied that it was Le Jeune who had ridden over the heath back again to say something to him, rode out us his place of concealment to meet him. \" What is it Le Jeune ?\" he asked. \" Hush !\u2014 oil, hush !\" \" Ah ! Is there danger ?\" \" Always \u2014 always, when you are so impru dent\" Certainly, however, Le Jeune was a name not identified in his mind with his new secretary; and Heron began to doubt if he were not deceived, by some similarity of tones of the voices, into, for a moment, believing tbey were one and the same person. \" What have I done ?\" The Earl of Whitcombe allowed Le Jenne te pass him, and turned his attention to Lorn Waringdale. Creeping up tte hill, he came so close to War ringdale that he could hear any word he said, ar he muttered to himself. \" Uttered my name again to the night-air.\" \" Pho ! pho ! Is that all ?\" \" And enough too, my Lord Warringdale.\" \" Ah ! How dare you ? \" \" And how dare you ?\" \" Are you mad, that yon come back bere to pick a quarrel with me ? What do you mean ? \u2014 what do you want ? Speak out ! What is it ?\" \" Now you are more reasonable. The moment I name you, you feel fee danger, and are maddened at the indiscretion. \u00bbI have just ridden back to tell you that, pausing for a minute at the ' Green Man and Still,' to get my horse a mouthful of wet hay, the ostler said a carriage had gone over fee heath with tte Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" I am too nervous and unmanned to-night for any further adventures on the heath,\" muttered Warringdale. \" I wiU retnrn to the castle and sleep \u2014 sleep. Shall I ever sleep calmly again ? Ob, if I could only get by force or fraud that written declaration from Amelia Staunton that would at once crush this vile Earl of Whitcombe, all would be well. I will try again ! \u2014 I will try again !\" These words feU Uke flames upon the heart of Felix Heron. \" I know it\" \"Oh, you do?\" \" I de.\" He was on the point of rushing forward and forcing, or attempting to force, Warringdale, at the peril of his life, to give a full and perfect explana tion of them. Warringdale spoke gloomily. \" And have you stopped him ? It might have been fancy, but I thought I heard pistol-shots The wind is the other way, and carried fee sounds from me, but I thought I heard them.\" \" You did hear them.\" But prudence withheld him. Would it not be better to follow him ? What castle could be mean but that on Shooter's Hill \u2014 the Castle of Severndroog, which he, Heron, well knew was the property of the Earl of Whitcombe \u2014 his property, since he was fee veritable Earl ? \" What has happened, then ?\" \" Nothing.\" \" Well, it could not be mnch lags, at all events ; but, ae I find yon in an Ul-humour, I will be off again. I thought you would feel obliged to me for the in formation, and so have ridden back with it\" Events, since his accession to tte title, had suc ceeded each other with such rapidity that he had nut had time, and scarcely inclination, to visit that small estate on Shooter's Hill whioh contained the castle. \" I am !\u2014 I am ! But\u2014 but\u2014 \" \"But what?\" Little did he expect that his first visit to it would be in the dead, dark hour of the night, as a spy upon the words and actions of his half brother. \" I am vexed \u2014 vexed to the souL I am afraid the heath will be no longer a good place for me. I have seen Felix Heron, and he has-^\" \u2022' Not seen you ?\" \" No, thank heaven!\" \" Hem ! I fancy, if any thanks are. due, it is to the other place, and not to heaven. But I must be off to town again, as fast as my horse's legs can carry me- 1 only wanted to give you this news, and so good night!\" There was a tone of irritation about Le Jenne, which seemed to imply that he thought himself bot ooldly thanked \u2014 if at all \u2014 for the trouble he had taken to ride back over Blackheath, to give Lord Warriigdale what might have been valuab'c &-A important information. \" Yes,\" he said \u2014 \" yes, Warringdale, I will follow you. I give np my original intent in cross ing Blackheath by night, which was to seek Bridgewater, and hold councU with him on matter. near and dear to my heart\u2014 and I will foUow yon. bad heart that you are, and bad brother that yo> are to me ; and bad son that you were to him wh is now no more!\""], [69, "63 EDITH HERON. But Warringdale was in the castle. FeUx Heron was outside it CHAPTER XXII. He stepped back on to the lawn, and he took a long aud anxious look at the gloomy edifice. Black, cold, and stern, with nothing to reUeve it against the night sky, it rose up before him, like a strangely shaped mass of rock But that did not last long ; the blackness was soon broken by a faint flish of light from a win dow not many feet above the porch. The light lingered for a few moments, getting dimmer and dimmer as it bo lingered, and for a time Felix Heron was at a loss to account for fee phenomenon. THE SECRETS OF THE CASTLE ON SHOOTER'S HILL ELUDE THE DISCOVERT OF FELIX HERON. Lord Warringdale dismounted, and led his horse by the bridle up the old hiU. Felix Heron soUowed him with the stealthy step of a North American Indian. There was a strange feeUng on the mind of the Earl of Whitcombe, that destiny or providence had brought him to Blackheath on that night for the purpose of revealing to him a something that would deeply concern and interest him. In that conclusion he almost forgot fee first motive that had actuated him in leaving his car riage for the purpose of foUowing the \" White Highwayman.\" And now he was assured that the \" While High wayman\" was no other than Lord Warringdale, he was more than ever inclined to think that his fate was somehow mingled up in a particular fashion wife the events of that night. Warringdale paused at fee gate by which he had sought privately an entrance to the grounds that surrounded the old castellated residence. Then he started iu his own mind a supposition on the subject, whi.h, in truth, was the correct one. There was a long corridor on the upper floor of fee castle, which was reached by a Sight of stone steps from the hall Tbat corridor went from the front to the back of the building, and no doubt the person carrying the light bad ascended with it from the hall, and then had proceeded down the corridor. That would acoount for the light growing each moment gradually dimmer.' It would naturally do so to the perception of Felix Heron as he who carried it receded from his sight It was easy for Heron to follow him on foot. Once, and once only, owing to the Earl treading upon a dry twig of a tree, and it cracking under his foot, a sufficient ncise was made te induce Warringdale to pause and listen. But aU was still again. \" I thought I heard something,\" he said. Heron did not make fee slightest movement \" Some night bird, I suppose,\" added Warring dale. But that dim illumination gave Heron an idea. If he could cUmb up fee porch, and find his way to the window above it, he might be able to make an entrance to fee castle. This was no sooner thought of than it was re duced to practice. The porch was not above sixteen feet from the level of the topmost stone step of the doorway. Thick ivy, and a jessamine of great age and strength, grew completely over tte porch. It would have been an easy task in daylight when the strong stems could have been seen and taken advantage of, to climb that porch by the aid of the ivy and fee jessamine. But at night it was another matter. It was only by the sense of touch that Heron could rely upon his progress. He might at any moment trust to a weak or loose stem, and then he would inevitably fall. But such an accident, by good luck, did not happen to him, and he reached the top of the porch in safety. It was covered with lead, and afforded a good foothold. Still Heron was silent, although there was no call or sonnd which any night bird could make with which he was not famiUar, and which he could not imitate wife ease. \" Or some fox, perhaps, or alarmed leveret,\" said Warringdale, after another pause. Then he went on. And then Felix Heron soUowed him. Right up to the castle entrance, in front of that lawn which we have before mentioned, went the \" White Highwayman.\" He tied his horse to a sapling. He disappeared in the deep shadow of the castle porch, and then Felix Heron found himself at fault. How should he effect an entrance to that place ? It would have been by far too daring and hazardous to attempt to follow over the threshold on the very footsteps of Warringdale \u2014 not hazard ous, however, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, for Felix Heron valued the hostUity and the prowess of Lord Warringdale not, perhaps, so much as he would feat of a cat The window through which he had seen fee faint light was not above his reach. There was no fastening. Felix Heron drew himself np, and, opening the window noiselessly, he, with great agility and dexterity, introduced himself into the castle. Into his own castle. For in good truth no one in life had the right he had to stand beneath that roof. But it would have been hazardous as regarded his purpose of watching and playing the spy npon the villain. The words that Warringdale had uttered, in which tbe name of Amelia Staunton had occurred, filled him, Heron, with a tumult of strange emo tions. But a greater danger awaited Felix Heron, when he fairly got through the window, than he had encountered in climbing fee ivy and fee jessamine over the porch. It did not occur to him that he had anything to do but quietly to drop on to the floor of the gallery or corridor in which he had seen the lig-rt Such, however, was not exactly the oase. The staircase from tie floor below passed that window before it made a landing. Did his mother still live ? If so, did Warrringdale know where she was to be fonnd ? Was she h's prisoner in that old residence of the Whitcombes ? These were questions which came with a rush from his heart to his brain. And it was to solve the last one that he followed fn each a stealthy fashion his bad half-brother. Felix Heron then fell a depth of some twelve feet on to the stairs Then he feU, or rather rolled, down sev8<__l cf"], [70, "64 EDITH HERON. the steps, and only saved himself from going fur ther by an accidental clutch at fee balustrades. The noise feat this fall made might well reaoh the ears of any one who was near at hand or lis tening, and Heron at the moment almost gave up the idea of further secrecy in his expedition. He scrambled to his feet, and laid his hand on his sword. article of furniture. Hush! hush! He hears a voice ! The voice of the \" White Highwayman.\" The voice of Lord Warringdale \u2014 his bad, his villanous half-brother \u2014 whom he has so often spared. \" No,\" said fee voice ; \" I tell you there is no hope but in the course I lay open to you.\" \" Mercy ! oh, mercy !\" The reply was in a female voice. How is it that the tones fall upon the heart of FeUx Heron like dew from heaven upon the parched Ups of some one who faints in the desert for a drop of water? Does nature speak with eloquent appeals to him, and tell him that those tones are bolonging to his mother ? No. All was still. Warringdale must have reached some very dis tant part of the castle to be out of earshot of the noise that the Earl of Whitcombe had made. \" Heaven aid me!\" said Heron. He was bruised and shaken, but not materially hurt ; and he ascended the remainder of the stair case at once, and reached the landing. He thought it would be better to take the course he had seen the light go, even if, upon reaohing the end of tte corridor, he should hear nothing of him of whom he came in search. Does he at length bear tbe voice of that poor lost, persecuted Amelia Staunton, who, while re ported dead, yet was a wanderer on the face of the earth, or a prisoner to those who had made her Ufe a blight and a desolation ? Ftlix Heron felt as if the world spun round with him in a wUd vortex, and he thought that for the first time in his life his senses were passing from him. As he had supposed, when he saw tte light recede, the corridor went the whole depth of the castle. Numerous chambers opened from it on either side, but Heron went the whole length until he was stopped by a staircase at feat further end similar to the one he had faUen upon. It was almost a wonder that he did not have another fall. By an effort, he rallied from this condition, and then it was the hateful tones of Lord Warringdale feat struck upon his revivified senses. \" 'Tis all in vain ! I tell you it is all in vain !\" were the words. \" There is no other help.\" \" Do not \u2014 do not say so !\" That was the female voice again. \" I do say bo ; and keep, for your consolation in your bigotry and your obstinacy, fee fact that you have murdered your own son !\" \" No, no ! \u2014 heaven, no !\" \" I say yes.\" Then there came fee sound of weeping. Felix Heron could hear no more. He made a movement forward in the direction of the sounds, and he touched fee handle of a door. He felt con fident that he had but to open that door, and he shonld be face to face wife the villain Warring dale. The darkness in that corridor wa9 intense. The fact was, that the only light it had was from fee two staircases, above which rose the turrets of the castle, from the roofs of which came, no doubt, light sufficient in the daytime ; but at night that corridor was dark as a dun geon. Just finding, then, that he was on the brink of the other flight of stairs in time to avoid falling down them, Heron held by the balustrade and leant over to listen. A faint sound came up to his ears. Was it a cry of distress ? Was it a half-smothered shout for help? Did it really shape itself, as he heard it, into fee cry of \" Murder ?\" The blood ran cold about the heart of fee Earl of Whitcombe as he heard that cry. And \u2014 oh, gracious and happy thought ! \u2014 who should say feat at the same moment he might not olasp his long-lost, much-loved mother to his heart ? Not for one half-moment did he hesitate. He dashed down the staircase. At the foot of the flight of stairs he paused, and held his breath to listen again. Yes. He heard fee cry repeated. For a time there was a strange sense of bewil derment in his brain to know from whence fee sound came. The hand of Heron trembled so mnch, that the handle of fee door slipped twice through his nerveless fingers, as he would have opened it That short delay gave him time to reflect To reflect how much better it would be if he were to control his feelings for a few moments \u2014 only a few moments\u2014 in the hope of hearing from the villain's own mouth what it was that Warringdale had to propose to his mother \u2014 if feat poor wailing creature were his mother. He wanted, too, to hear Warringdale utter her name\u2014 for there was a terrible dread upon the mind of H .ron of stirring his heart to its inmost depths for some one whc inight not, after aU, be Amelia Staunton. At one time be thought it was above him, and then it seemed fathoms deep below the level on whiih he was. The state of mind of Felix Heron was painful to the point of agony. What should he do ? What could he do ? Then the sound came again. It was a wailing cry this time \u2014 not acute, as if calUng for help, as it had seemed to be before. Therefore be paused. And Warringdale spoke again. \" You surely cannot comprehend me, or yoO could not hesitate for an instant in what you have to do ?\" \" Yes, yes ! You speak of my boy\u2014 of my son ! The mother's poor heart oo_upreh__i(_s but too well.\" Bat he felt assured that it was on fee same level with himself. \" Oh, for the least glimmer of light to show me where I am 1\" thought Heron. But there came no such glimmer. He held out his sword before him, and step by step, for fear of some pitfall, he elowly advanced. The sword-blade met with an obstacle, a door \u2014a half-open door. He passed through it\u2014 his \u2022\u2022\u2022et suit soft carpeting ; he stumbled over some \" You are right. It is of him I speak.\" \" It is harsh music.\" Felix Heron's heart bled to hear these word*"], [71, "Emnt HERON. 65 the sentimeut struck home to him. It was music to hear him spoken of, to that poor desolate being; but harsh music, inasmuch as the tones were those of Warringdale. \" Harsh or not, Amelia Staunton \" Heron almost uttered a shout. He had heard the name that resolved all his doubts. wayman. All the agents of the law were arrayed against him, and in due course he has been taken and condemned to death ! \" \" Death ?\u2014 death ? My boy to death ?\" \" Exactly so.

Oh, heaven be merciful to fee dead and to the living!\" Amelia Staunton burst into tears, and sobbed as though her heart would break. Amelia Staunton was silent- But she was not convinced feat fee mau who spoke to her in the way that WaTringdale did had any feeling or compassion in his disposition. \" Your fate has been a hard one,\" added War ringdale, with mock com -liberation. \" to hard ! \u2014 so hard !\" CHAPTER XXIII. \" I know it The late Earl of Whitcombe, when tired of the beauty that had allured him, began to reflect upon the mesalliance he bad committed in marrying you \u2014 for, I fancy, marry you he did. He saw that he had only to look around him in the ranks of fashion, nobility, and wealth, to choose for himself a fitting mate, and then he discarded you!\" \"Alas! alas!\" FELIX HERON RELIEVES HIMSELF TO EE THE VICTIM OF A MAGICAL DELUSION. Did the heart of feat poor persecuted Amelia Staunton fly back at tbat moment to long passed away happier days ? Did she remember that the Earl of Whitcombe, whom she now heard was no more, had once loved her ? \" It was at first coldness.\" \"It was! \u2014 it was!\" It would seem so. \"Then neglect!\" \"Oh, heaven!\" Alas, poor heart ! No doubt such was the case- No doulst at that \"Then harshness! \u2014 and then \u2014 was it a blow?\" sad moment she saw herself a girl again, young handsome, and beloved. No doubt, the echo of fond words and gentle tones came welling up from the profoundest depths of her heart, to re mind her of the happy, happy past. And amid all her persecutions, all the misery she had suffered, and all the cruelty that had been practised in regard to her, she still had tears for the betrayer \u2014 tears for the man who had been to her a destroying angel, or ratter a fiend armed for her despair. Oh, woman's heart! when, and under what circumstances, is thy tenderness and forgiveness exhausted ? Amelia Staunton shuddered. Fel x Heron held his brow, for he felt at these words as if his brain would burst Yes, he was resolved to hear all before, like some immortal avenger, he made his awful presence known in that castle. \" Then,\" added Warringdale, \" you revolted. All that was of a nature to resist oppression ro6e up in your heart, and you resisted the man who betrajed and blighted your affections. That was the exouse he wanted ; and you were seized and conveyed to the cell cf an asylum, where you lay for many a long year without hope.\" \" Oh, no, I was not without hope, for I felt that my child lived I\" \" Indeed 1\" Amelia Staunton wept bitterly. And for whom ?

In each arm-chair sat a something that looked like a human figure. A faint slicker of the lantern gave a be ter light for a passing minute, and Heron laid his hand upon fee arm of the figure nearest to him. A portion of the light drapery feU to the floor. Horror ! horror ! The form feat sat in feat chair in fee gar ments of a female was but a skeleton ; and fee drapery he had touched, and which fell from fee arm, disclosed the fleshless bone it had covered. An idea that he was mad \u2014 that he most be mad\u2014 took possession of Felix Heron. \" Help ! help !\" he cried aloud. The sound of his own voice -in some measure reassured him, and res* .red him to a better state of mind and feeling. He raised the lantern. \" Then it was not aU a dream ?\" \" It matters not. You have the power to save him- Will you do so ?\" \" Ought I\u2014 dare I do as you would have me ? Why \u2014 why is it that, if mercy can be shown to him, it cannot be shown without his mother's per jury ?\" \" The King is obstinate. A declaration from you, to the effect feat he is illegitimate, will enable the King to get rid of the stain of his con viction on the nobility, and then he will, as plain Felix Heron, be pardoned !\" \" Felix Heron ?\" \" Curses on my heedless tongue!\" Lord Warringdale fonnd that from time to time he was carelessly giving to Amelia Staunton in formation that might be most valuable to her. He was angry with himself, but he turned his anger towards her. He flung open the lens, and by a touch trimmed tte wick, and held it tremblingly above his head. The light feat it gave forth was then largely in creased. \" Say at once, will you make such a declaration or not, for I have neither time nor inclination to further parley wife yon ?\" \"I cannot!\" No ! it was no delusion. Seated at that table was a form of death, in female habiliments of an antique fashion. The figure on the opposite side was attired in modern apparel. It was, or it had been, a man. A cloak partially concealed the face, and trailed down to the floor. \" Cannot ! Say, rather, will not ; and feat yon conceive a strange and hideous satisfaction in tte thonght that you are avenged on the Earl of Whitcombe by leaving a son of his to die \" FeUx Heron tonched tte coat ; it fell That form, too, was but fee poor, last remnant of humanity. Heron glanced at tte apparel. There was a peculiarity of colour and cut about the coat, which he racoUected to have noticed about Lord War ringdale's coat, when he last had a good opportunity of observing him on tte occasion of fee duel, in Kensington Gardens, wife the Earl of Bridge water. \" No, no 1\" \" To die a felon's death !\" \" OU, horror ! horror 1 I will do it !\" \"Ah!\" \" I will \u2014 I wiU \u2014 I will save him ! What is honour \u2014 what credit \u2014 what reputation \u2014 what is all the world, compared to the life of my boy ?\" \" Spoken like a mother !\" The sneering tone of Lord Warringdale was lerrible to hear: it sounded more like the voice in which some fiend would rejoice in the destruction of a human soul. \"Gracious heaven!\" exclaimed Heron; \"have my senses played me some terrible and fantastic trick ?\u2014 and have I, because I was beneath the same roof wilh these two fearful objects, beUeved that I heard them in conversation ?\" A cold shudder came across fee heart of Felix Heron as he asked himself fee terrible question \u2014 \" Must I kiU this man ?\" Heron set down fee lantern, and staggering back tiU he leant against fee waU of the apart ment, he clasped both hands over his brow, and strove to collect his thoughts into some healthful channel. Then he heard the deep sols of Amelia Staunton \u2014 of that mother whom he had longed for, sighed for, sought so earnestly for, and who now, he hoped and believed, he should b. able to hold to his heart Human feeling could be trodden down no longer. Felix Heron felt that he must rush forward and put an end to the suffering that that poor mother underwent from the cru?l misrepre sentations of Lord Warringdale, or his heart would break. Well might it be an effort to do bo. WeU might he find it difficult to convince him self that he was not the victim of some fearful nightmare of tte senses, which presented to him those shuddering images of the grave. The lantern flickered then into better radiance than it had yet exhibited, but it was only for a moment. With a cry that rang through the old castle, he darted throngh tte door that would surely conduct him into the next apartment, in which fee conver sation had taken place. \"Mother! mother! I am here! \u2014 I, your son \u2014 your own son, Felix Heron ! I am here \u2014 here to save \u2014 to love \u2014 to bless you !\" The door yielded to his touch. He dashed into fee next apartment The echo of his own voice accompanied him, and mingling with that echo he fancied he heard a something that sounded like a smothered shriek A dim light was in the room. That dim light came from an expiring lantern feat was upon a table. It sent some feeble rays about it ; and for a moment, then, Felix Heron thought that he saw Amelia Staunton, his mother, before him. There were two old arm-chairs drawn close to the table\u2014 one faced fee other \u2014 and that expiring The Uttle flame of tte light seemed to suddenly dart upwards into tte air and disappeared. Darkness ! \u2022 Darkness in that gloomy place I Darkness in such fearful company! Well might even tte bold heart of that young and gallant Earl of Whitcombe faU him for a moment under such circumstances of terror and mjstery. With fee Uving he could combat. Let tte odd. be what they might, and fee power arrayed against him, however etrong, he was not fee mau to quiil before mortal foe. But here were the sad and horrible inhabitants of tte grave set up against him ; and although in fee light of day he would not have shrunk even from those ghastly memorials of humanity, there was"], [74, "EDITH HERON 68 No further interruption was offered to him, and when he reached a fence over which he made rill passage good, and stood on the open road, he fell a sensation of great relief. The oastle looked black, dis nal, and sombre as he cast bis eyes back towards it. \" Rest in peace for a time, be yon who you may feat inhabit that gloomy pile,\" said Heron. \" I will soon visit you again.\" With rapid strides he made his way down fee hill to the heath. The carriage that he had sent on before him te tte Eirl of Bridgewater'a house at Charlton, waa of course out of sight, and the only consideration now that made Heron pause for a few seconds waa whether he should follow it, and still pay the visit he had projected, or go to London, as the night was already eomnwhat advanced. These doubts and deliberations were however put an end to by his hearing the 6harp gallop of a horse's feet on the heath. Was it the \" White Highwayman\" again? Heron had hardly time to ask himself the ques tion, when he became convinced that the horse man, whoever he was, made rapid way towards Shooters' Hill. Heedless of all obstacles that might be in his way, this mounted man rode on, and when he got close to the foot of the hill, and in reality not a hundred paces from Felix Heron, be drew rein, and shouted aloud, \"Whitcombe! Whitcombe! If you be near here, answer me ! Whitcombe! Whitcombe 1\" something whioh might well shake any mortal nature in darkness and suoh companionship. FeUx Heron uttered a shout that was not exactly a cry for help\u2014 such a cry had never passed his lips; but it was one of those inarticulate calls which may burst from fee overstrained heart and over burdened senses. By good fortune, rather than any calculation of fee direction in which he went, he made his way to tbe door of tte room. Another moment, and he was in that outer apartment where he had listened to the discourse which had seemed to take place between Amelia Staunton and Lord Warringdale. But stiU Felix Heron paused net. By a kind of instinct he made his way through the castle in precisely the same route that had conducted him to feat room of horror and of mystery. It is probable enough feat had he chosen to do so, he might easily bave made his way through fee hall, and so out of the ill-omened building by fee front gates, but he thought of nothing but leaving Severndroog Castle as he had entered. The long corridor was reached. The window by which he had entered the castle was difficult to reach, but by some means Heron made a leap at it, and caught the sill. Before you could have counted ten, he was on fee lawn in front of the castle. Then he paused. Up to that moment he had acted from a kind of instinct which had been purely physical in its nature, but now his mind began to act. Reflection came to his aid, and he paused, as he said to himself aloud, * Why, oh, why do I, wbo never yet fled from the living, fly from tte dead ?\" He began to be ashamed of the human weak ness that had induced him to dread being in the presence's those skeleton forms in the -lark. Then his first impulse was to return to the castle, and yet bring this startling adventure to some more satisfactory conclusion. Probably he would, in the dissatisfaction that be felt with himself in consequence of the precipitate slight he had made, have carried out this idea ; but tte sharp report of a pistol, at the instant he left tte shadow of a tree close to which he was on the lawn, warned him of the proximity of human foes. It was the voice of the young Earl of Bridge water. \" I am here !\" cried Felix Heron. \" Thank heaven!\" \" Ah, Bridgewater, I need not ask yon what brings you out upon the heath to-night.\" \"No, you need not, for you can guess, my dear friend. Your carriage and servants reached my house with an account that you were here, some where on the heath, engaged in mortal combat with a party of robbers.\" Heron laughed. \"Waa it not so?\" \"Not quite, Bridgewater. The fears of my coachman and footman, together with some little regard for their own reputations, have exaggerated fee danger.\" \" Nay, I think their reputations suffered a great deal more from the fact of leaving their lord and master in such jeopardy.\" \" They did not reason, Bridgewater. They only felt the panic of fear.\" \" You are hurt, Whitcombe?\" \" No, no.\" \" I thought you were.\" \" Why so ?\" \" It was more from tte tone of your voice feat I judged, than from anything else.\" \" My dear friend, I have seen sights to-night that might shake any mortal nerves.\" \" Indeed I\" The weapon might have been well or ill aimed at his life, but certainly no bullet touched him \u2014 yet that report tended more to bring Felix Heron back to an accurate and clear notion of his position, than anything else oould have done. It cleared away, so to speak, the superstitious feelings that had gathered thickly abont his heart and made him come back to fee rational world again. \"Ah, my Lord Warringdale,\" he said, \"I wifl not believe bnt that shot came from yon.\" He darted back again among ihe trees. Theu a new idea crossed his mind, and he said to himself, \" Why should I, at risk of my life from the hands of an assassin, prowl about this castle or its grounds, when in the broad daylight, with any force I choose to bring, I can enter its gates, for is it not my own ?\" This argument decide! him. He made his way towards fee confines of fee grounds wife what expedition he could. Through the tangled brushwood, in as right a line as he feenght he dimly saw would take him out on to fee rengh roadway that wound up the side of the hill, went fee Earl of Whitcombe. \" Yes. I will walk by fee side of yonr horse across the heath, and tell you what has happened to me as we go ; for although, now, I am anxious to get back to London as soon aa possible, I fancy my shortest way will be to seek my own carriage at your place at Charlton.\" \" No doubt of that\" \" Then, Bridgewater, listen, and I will tell yon all.\" The young Earl of Bridgewater did indeed listen, and that, too, with an attention that showed"], [75, "EDITH HERON. 69 how deeply interested he was in the account feat Felix Heron gave him of his strange adventures in the castle on Shooters' HiU. When Heron had concluded his narration, he said, sadly, \" New, Bridgewater, teU me frankly, and without reserve, what you think of this.\" \" I don't know what to think.\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, heaven, yes I And not in the horizon only is it, for it stretches upward\u2014 upward with its raven wings, and it obscures the annshine of my heart !\" The tone in which Felix Heron uttered these words, was one so fuU of exquisite grief and heart sickness, that the Earl of Bridgewater, along with his surprise, was deeply affected. After a few moments of sUence he spoke. \" Whitcombe \u2014 Whitcombe, can you bear that I should speak to you freely ?\" \" I can.\" \" But was I dreaming ?\" \" Certainly not !\" \" Then you think those skeleton forms were real ?\" \" My dear Whitcombe, do you know that the casUe has always had an evil reputation?\" \" As how ?\" \" Then permit me to say that I fancy yoa would not have commenced this subject to me unless yon had meant that it should be spoken of between us.\" \" It is so.\" \" There is not a soul residing within a couple of miles of it who will not tell yon it is haunted.\" \" Except you, Bridgewater.\" \" WeU\u2014 I\u2014 a\u2014 I \" \" Thank heaven for feat!\" Why so thankful, Bridgewater ?\" \" Because I feel convinced feat some mere fancy, or some train of circumstances which appear to point to conclusions which have no real existence, are pressing upon yonr mind, and snch matters have a tendency to overpower the reason and in capacitate the person most interested from coming to a correct estimate of them.\" \" Nay, my friend, you cannot surely be a be liever in such idle fancies?\" \" I lnaow not what to say, or what to think. It was but last night that, from a kind of beUry which is at the topmost storey of my own house at Charlton, and which commands an extensive view, I happened to cast my eyes in the direction of the castle on Shooters' HiU.\" \" I see \u2014 I see.\" \" My castle.\" \" Just so \u2014 your castle ; named, I think, Severn droog.\" \" That, Bridgewater, is its somewhat Flemish name. Well, what did you see ?\" \" I saw a strange light run along the battlement at the top.\" \" Are you sure ?\" \" Quite sure, as that I am here, at this present moment, talking to yon.\" \" Then, Bridgewater, I have made up my mind.

Lady Bridgewater will excuse me that I leave herto pro ceed to London with you. Permit me, Whitcombe, to take a seat in your carriage to town, as yonr travelling companion.\" \" I shall do so with pleasure, and fain wonld have asked so much as a favour, but feared to do so. As we travel, Bridgewater, I will teU you frankly and freely what it is that oppresses me ; for in good truth this interrupted visit that I was about to pay you to-night was for that express purpose, and none other.\" In half an hour more the Earl of Whitcombe and Felix Heron were on their route to London, across the heath again. \" Agreed !\" \" That is weU. My mind feels lighter ; and now I will get into my carriage at your house, to which we are, I fanoy, near at hand, and go home, for Edith will wonder what has become of me. Oh, Edith! Edith!\" \"Eh\u2014 what?\" The tone in which Felix Heron had pronounced fee name of Edith so surprised the Earl of Bridge water, feat he paused and laid his hand on the shoulder of his friend by an involuntary action, expressive of astonishment No \"White Highwayman,\" however, tow made his appearance. And Heron began his confidential oommnnica tion. \" In old times, when danger and difficulty sur rounded Edith and myseU \u2014 when we lived a primitive sort of Ufe, in old Epping Forest \u2014 we were very, very happy.\" The voice of Heron faltered as he attered tinea words. CHAPTER XXIV. FELIX HERON UNBURDSNS HI8 HEART OF A TERRIBLE AND SECRET SORROW. Never before, in all their intercourse together, had Heron pronounced the name of Edith to his friend Bridgewater in the accents of grief feat he had just spoken. \" What is this ? What is the meaning of this ? Good heaven, Whitcombe ! is it possible that even fee shadow of a cloud is on the horizon of yonr happiness?\" \" Worse than the shadow !\" \" Bear with me, dear friend,\" he added. \"If yoo think me weak, judge me not harshly, but \u00bb_ member that there are oircumstances whish bow down tte strongest of us and make ns weak as children.\" \" I pray you go on, Whitcombe.

And yet\u2014 and yet \u2014 it is so sad that \u2014 that \" \" That what ?\" \" That my Edith cannot confide in me !\" These were words that tbe Earl of Bridgewater in good truth had no reply to. They tell upon his heart with a cold chill, and he asked himself at that moment what would be his feelings and ideas if his young Countess were to keep some secret cause of grief from him, and some one were to suggest that she might confide it to a stranger. But it was difficult to know what else to sug gest ; and after the silence that ensued had lasted long enough to be almost painful fee Earl of Bridgewater said, \" Whitcombe, make an effort.\" \" What effort ?\" \" The purity of Edith, Oeuntesa of Whitcombe.\" Felix Heron clasped fee hand of bis friend in silence, while grateful tears gathered to his eyes. \" Thanks ! \u2014 thanks !\" he then said, after a somewhat lengthened pause. \" Thanks, dear Bridgewater.

Shall I go home wife you, or shall I go to my sister's, in Clarges Street?\" \" Home with me, if you will, Bridgewater. I shall be glad of your society.\" The Earl of Whitcombe's carriage rattled along Pall Mall, and turned into St. James's Street, and was soon at the door of Whitcombe House, where it would have stopped, hai not a sndden thought came to the mind of Felix Heron, which induced him to let down the front window, and call to the coachman, \" Drive on ! \u2014 drive on ! Do not stop ; go on, and turn the next corner.\" The order was obeyed. By the carriage therefore passing tte door of old Whitcombe House, no one who might be listering to its progress from within, could have supposed that it was the Earl's equipage. The Earl of Bridgewater placed his hand upon the arm of Felix Heron, as he said, \" My friend \u2014 my friend, as you are a living man, beware !\" \" Beware ! Of what ?\" \" What is yours, then ?\" \" I always think when I look at him, especiaUy in daylight, that he is made up to some sort of disguise.\" \" That is it, Whitcombe\u2014 that is it That is preoisely what I was going to say.\" \" Then we wiU see if he be in the house ; and if not, I will make him say where he has been, even if it should be at the sword's point!\" \" Do so \u2014 do so !\" CHAPTER XXV. EDITH HAS A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH JOHN TARLETON, AND INCURS GREAT DAItGEE. Alas, poor Edith ! What are yon to do, fair, gentle, good, and true Countess of Whitcombe ? How are yon to disen tangle yourseU from the one unhappy mistake yon have made ? \" Of such arts as these.\" \"What? What arts?\" How retrace the one false step ? The mistake of listening for a moment to fee spurious argumentation of your brother, fee infa mous John Tarleton. \" You want to enter your own house secretly. Oh, Whitcombe \u2014 Whitcombe, has your faith in Edith sunk so low as that ?\" \" No, no ! By the heaven, above ns, no !\" \"And yet \" \" Yet, you would say there is the fact that I have ordered the carriage past my own door. It is so ; but only see now, Bridgewater, how people's actions may bear the most sinister aspects, and yet be susceptible of innocent explanations. I had a fancy that in that castle or close to it, I should rather say at Shooters' HiU, I heard the voice of fee man who is my secretary here at Whitcombe House.\" The false step of keeping for one brief hour a secret from fee breast of Felix Heron. To the pure and guUeless spirit of Edith it was terrible suffering to act as she was acting towards one whom she never loved better than she loved him now \u2014 one for whom she would cheerfuUy, at any moment, have laid down her life, had snch a sacrifice been necessary. But what was she to do ? Could she look forward to fee death of feat bold bad man, who called himself her brother, at fee hands of her husband ? \" That man to whom you considered yon owed your life on the night of fee Court baU ?\" \"The same!\" Could she think it possible feat Felix Heron would at once, and with ease, forego that registered vow in heaven, which he had recorded there, to be avenged npon the murder of his father ? Oh, unhappy Edith I Tom and distracted by contending emotions, was it a matter ef wonder that Felix Heron should find her different from what she was ? \" Well, Whitcombe ?\" \" Well, then, it was of him I thought when I ordered the carriage to go past the door of Whit- combe House, and not of Edith. I wonld fain either confirm or dissipate my suspicions ; and so if he be in fee house, I wanted to take him at una- wares, for he has had ample time to get back from Shooters' Hill, if he were in truth there.\" \" Forgive me, Whitcombe.\" \" Mention it not ; you might weU think what you did.\" The two Earls alighted from fee carriage some few paces down King Street, and Felix Heron gave a brief order to his coachman to take the carriage to fee stables, which were at the back of Whit- combe House, and of very considerable extent. Indeed, those stables had at one time contained such a stud of horses, that they were perfectly royal iu their variety. On foot, then, Heron and his friend Bridgewater proceeded to Whitcombe House. \" I have seen once or twice this man you picked up in the streets,\" said Bridgewater; \" and I must confess I always I_\u00a9k npon him wife eyes of suspicion.\" \" And I, too.\" \" There is likewise an impression on my mind feat I have seen him on some other occasion that was not favourable to him.\" Was it surprising that she should be to him\u2014 even to him whom she loved so dearly, so fondly, so truly \u2014 aU that he had with such agony of heart described to fee Earl of Bridgewater ? Alas, no ! Edith is in one of fee splendid drawing-rooms of Whitcombe House \u2014 feat one which Felix Heron had had so tastefully adorned in green and sUver for her special use. The light green silken hangings might faintly remind her of fee forest home at Epping, where they had passed so many happy hours. The glistening sUver might represent fee morn ing sunlight, as it used to gleam in beauty through the old trees. But there was no beauty now for poor Edith. The heart makes its own happiness and sun shine, and Edith's was shrouded in gloom. It was the night of the appointment wife John Tarleton. Edith had suffered a martyrdom of pain and anxiety during the lapse of that Uttle week. And now the night had come when the impUed promise that she would meet this man must be ful filled, and she trembled for the result Oh, that she had had the courage daring that week to cast herself npon fee breast of Felix Heron, and teU him aU I Oh, feat she had had fee faith to trust to him te \"That is very strange, indeed, Bridgewater, because I have the same idea.\" \" Well, I have another notion in regard to him.\" \" Stop ! let me find ( it if that, too, is tte same as I have \""], [78, "EDITH HERON. 72 I Was there no good angel at hand to whisper in her ears, feat 'he happiness of her life and the lovs of FeUx Heron was worth a thousand brothers ? Bpare her fee pang she dreaded, and to escape | whioh she encountered a thousand pangs, each one more terrible ! What was fee safety\u2014 what was fee life of such a man as John Tarleton, or a hundred such worthless Uves, compared to the destruction of the happiness of such hearts as Edith's and Felix Heron's? , Faint, sick, and weary, poor Edith had waited for that night to come, and wondered what she should say, and what she shonld do, to induce Felix Heron to leave her to herseU, feat she might keep the iU-omened appointment Bnt it was on feat day that the scene had taken place between them which Heron had related to Bridgewater. That scene, and that conversation, during which Heron had accidentally mentioned the murderer of his father without knowing that at the same time he mentioned the brother of Edith, and touohed upon fee source of ali her terrors, her anxieties, her estrangement, and her tears. And it was after that scene that Felix had made up his mind that he would consult his friend tte Earl of Bridgewater, for he began to be afraid of himseU. Afraid that in a matter in which his feelings were so much interested, he would not be able to Alas, no ! Edith had once shuddered at fee idea of -Heron taking the life of one so near to her, and she could not diseemble for a moment the horror wife which the idea filled her. The hour of the appointment was rapidly ap proaching. A cold shudder came across Edith as she noted the rapid progress of time. \" Soon, oh, too soon !\" she moaned. \" Would that Felix were at home, and that I could not meet this man.\" It would have been now a positive relief to Edith if she could have avoided the assignation by any means that would have excused her to herself. But that was not to be. It stemed as if fate or fortune had thrown the most unusual facilities in her way. It was the only evening on which Felix Heron had gone any distance from his home, and then she was mistress of the mansion, wife no one to interrupt her \u2014 lo one to say nay to her. Poor, poor Edith ! She paced the drawing-room with disordered steps \u2014 she wrung her hands and she shed tears. But the time went on, and a clock of rich adorn ments feat was on the chimney-piece warned her that but a quarter of an hour must elapse before she must seek those apartments in which she had to meet John Tarleton, and where he had found the means ef making his way by some of the secret passages feat connected fee extensive stabling of Whitcombe House with the mansion itself \" Time, time \u2014 it is time !\" said Edith wife a shudder. Surely at that moment some kind spirit mnst have taken pity npon Edith, and made her a sug gestion. That suggestion was conveyed to her in a strange fashion. As she passed a console table, not far from the door of the drawing-room by which she was about to leave it, fee long full sleeve of her dress, as it was the fashion then to wear them, caught ihe corner of a book that lay near to the edge of thev table. reason calmly and rationally. The carriage was ordered, and Felix Heron started for Charlton, so that Edith had, without any act at aU, but merely from the excitement of her own feelings, accomplished her object She had Whitcombe House to herself. But now feat such was fee fact, now feat there seemed in reality no obstruction to the interview she had promised to hold* with John Tarleton, she trembed at the facility with which an act oould be performed feat Felix Heron, who was aU the world to her, must have disapproved. No one could have looked into the fair face of Edith on that night without a feeling of pity. She looked so wan, so desolate, so truly un happy. Not even when she was a prisoner in that ter rible house in Newgate Street \u2014 fee abode of the relentless Jonathan Wild\u2014 did poor Edith suffer one half that she now endured in fee splendid mansion of the Whitcombe-. She clasped her hands over her face as she sat in feat magnificent drawing-room, and in mourn ful accents she spoke. \" Oh, father, father, you were not kind to me, your own chUd, whUe you were in Ufe, bnt that unkindness was as nothing in comparison wife the terrible legacy you have left mel\" The legaoy was her brother. John Tarleton was the cloud feat was in fee fair sky of Edith's happiness. The book feU to the floor. Edith had just uttered the words, \" Kind heaven suggest to me to whom I shall relate all these sad events, and from whom I shall obtain consola tion !\" when the litUe accident with fee book o-curred- The volume turned over in its faU, and opened ; one ef the covers disclosed the plain leaf of paper immediately within it On that leaf was written a name. She then took the letter which had been found upon the dead body of her father and brought to her, and which she always now carried about with her, and read it over again attentively. Yes, there it was, as plain as plain could be. She had a brother, and feat brother, past aU doubt, was he with whom she had to meet that night The man who had possessed himself of her jewels \u2014 fee man who would from time to time oppress her with demands that, once yielded to, would know no end. \" The Lady Castleneau 1\" That name seemed to meet tbe eyes of Edith with a preternatural distinctness, and following so closely upon her aspiration and appeal to heaven to point out to her some one in whom she might confide on eaith, it appeared like a practical answer to the appeal. \" My aunt !\" exclaimed Elith. \" My dear, good, and loving aunt! Oh, yes, yes! To whom can I relate what has happened to me, so well as to her ?\" The man who had murdered fee fatter of Felix Heron.

Edith felt faint. \u2014 she passed through it \u2014 she ascended the stair case that led to fee suite of rooms in which she had before seen him, and, pale and breathless al most, she stood at the door of the apartment where fee first agitating interview had taken place. She heard a slight noise within fee room. Was he there ? \" Oh, gracious heaven, save me ! save me !\" She had to hold by the back of a chair for support It would not have surprised Editb, so shaken was her mind, and so full of solitary and strange musings had she become, if at that moment some being of another and a brighter world had shown itself to her mortal gaze. But imagination did not play her that trick, and Edith soon recovered from that creeping sensation of horror which had crept over her. Then the clock on the chimney- piece struck the hour of ten. If there, what was he about ? Plundering her jewel cases and toilette-table of articles that FeUx Heron would surely miss, and ask terrifying questions to her about ! That must be stopped. Edith turned fee handle of the lock, and entered fee apartment by a sudden impulse of courage which, had she delayed to take advantage of, would have evaporated iu another moment It wai quite a relief to her to And no one there but her own waiting- maid.

And, in addition to that, there was a something ubout her tone and manner that, Edith thought, betrayed a suspicion or a knowledge of she knew not what. John Tarleton is there, but he is too cautious to show himself suddenly. It is not that he fears to shock fee nerves of his sister ; but, for aU he knows, there may be some one else waiting for him. \" Speak, Edith,\" he said. \" Are you alone?\" \"Alone!\" she replied. John Tarleton bad that strange kind of faith in the truth, the sincerity, and the utter absence of aU guile in the heart of his sister, which fee worst of human beings often contract for the best, so that when she replied that she was alone, he took her word for that fact at once. All this might have been purely imaginary on the part of Edith, seeing feat, for the first time in her life, she bad something to conceal, but it hap pened to be fact If Edith could have seen this girl so soon as she was on the ither side of the door, her worst sus picions would have been confirmed The gill paused, and put her ear to fee panel.

The serpent \u2014 the adder that he was nursing in his bosom but to t-ting him. Edith thoo^ht the was alone now. From a drawer in a cabinet feat was in the room she took a small canvass bag, but small as it wiii, it was heavy and bulky with gold. rhu.t she placed ou a chair. Or<-rit she luid a handkerchief. John Tarleton was magnificent. It was quite evident that a love for ornamev. and fine apparel was one of the uppermost feelings it* his niuo. Some portion of the plunder which he had taken from Whitcombe House on his last visit had evi dently been devoted to the purpose of making a fine appearance. His attire was positively rich. That was not exactly a period of time in the history of English costume in which a man could make any very great display ; but certainly, com pared with tut-, present mode of dress \u2014 which fee very genius of awkwardness and ugliness must have invented\u2014 there was a good deal that might be done. Poor Edith 1 Stie thought to tempt John Tarleton to leave her for ever, by giving him so large a sum of money at once, that, he would feel he ought not to demand more of her. As if tte thief, on acnount of finding where abundance of booty was to be got, must needs turn honest after the first venture ! As if the miner, when he lights upon a rich auriferous vein, would be content to take posses sion of its first golden produce, and then visit it lo more! -\u25a0nd John Tarleton had done aU that was possible. He did not, however, look a gentleman. There was about him that indescribable but It was not by gold that Edith conld tempt John Tarleton to discontinue his visits to Whitcombe House. easily recognisable look of fee bully and the l'-fhin which some men can never conceal, and which would ..hi-ue forth in them if they were plated with gold and glittering with diamonds and rnbies. It was quite evident, though, that John Tarleton though himseU a remarkably pretty fellow. \" Well, sister,1' he said, as he made an affecta tion of strutting into the room with ease, and then delicately brushed wife one gloved hand some dust or pretended dust from the sleeve of his coat ; \u2014 \" well, bister, is this the affectionate re ception I have a right to expect ?\" Edith started to her Seet No. But if she could bave elaborated any plan by which he would have been convinced ifiere was nothing to be gained from his visits, she wonld have quietly enough been rid of him. And then Edith waked. A watch that belonged specially to fee Earl of Whitcombe was upon the toilette-table. It was richly mounted with brilliants, and as Edith's eyes fell npon it, she saw that fee time had run on to fully a quarter past ten. A hope \u2014 a faint hope that John Tarleton would not, could not come, sprang up in her heart Something might have happened him. Perhaps he was dead ! Eiith shuddered at the thought, and yet it was noi sd very improbable an one, considering what kind of man he, John Tarleton, was, and the sort She had, in the agitation and affliction of fee moment, sunk down into an arm-chair. But this levity of her brother aroused her. \" You may,\" she said, \" or you may not, be the son of my father. Yon may, by the accident of birth, be authorized to call me sister \""], [81, "EDITH HERON. 75 \" Hoity toity! what airs are these?\" \" Peace, sir!\" \" Ah, you pluck np a spirit?\" \" I do I\" \" The spirit of tte Tarletons ?\" \" No \u2014 fee spirit of truth, and resistance to op- sinee you feel that business cannot be transacted too quickly.

Did you really mean five hundred pounds ?\" \" I did.\" pression.\" \" Well, my fine lady sister, and what, pray, have you to say, after all this ?\" Edith started, and &\u25a0 sumed a listening attitude. John Tarleton saw fee action, and alarm at once took possession of him. He drew a pistol from hia pocket and shrunk back towards the door by which he had entered. \" Capital\u2014 capital ! Why, I won't come near you for a couple of months !\" \" Never !\" \" What is it ? \u2014 what is it ? What do you hear?\" \" Hush !\" \"Eb?\" \" By Jove ! I will be the death of any one who attempts to interfere wife me, even if it should be your fine gentleman of a husband !\" Edith darted at him a look of scorn. \" Never again, as you Uve.\" \" 0.1 ! that's the notion, is it ? Ha, hal That's it!\" \"That is it!\" \" You !\u2014 yon attempt for one half moment to bear even the glance of my husband ! You !\" Insolent ruffian aa he was, even John Tarleton shrunk before the look of ineffable scorn with which Edith regarded him. A look of rage crossed fee face of John Tarle ton, and for a few seconds it seemed as though he contemplated rushing upon Edith, and actually striking her. But if he had any such dast irdly purpose he relinquished it, and only spoke in a tone that showed he waa capable of any amount of villany. \" I tell you what it is, Sister Edith. If you think I am a fool, and to be frightened by any thing you can say or do, you are mistaken in your man.\" She had heard, or she fancied she had heard, some slight noise in tte corridor that these apartments adjoined. Anything was better than suspense; so Edith at once went to the door by which the corridor was reached \u2014 that same door at which the waiting-maid had left \u2014 and looked out \" Listen to me.\" No one was there. \"Well, I do.\" \" If you attempt to visit this house ever agaiu, after to-night, the consequences be upon your head not upon mine. You will be killed.\" \" Killed ?\" Had Edith, however, gone right out into tte corridor she __iust have seen, hiding in the next doorway, the suborned waiting-maid. But Edith contented herself by a glance from fee threshold of the room, and seeing no one, and hearing nothing, she returned and closed the door. \" Ay, slain ; for I declare to you that I wiU point you out to my husband, and I will say, \" Be hold the man who took the life of your father, the late Earl of Whitcombe, on the staircase of this mansion, but a few short weeks since.\" \" Lock it,\" said John Tarleton. \"No, IwUl not!\" \" YouwiUnot?\" \" And \u2014 and \u2014 what then ?\" \" I have said so !\" \" He will slay you !\" John Tarleton turned pale with anger and fear combined. \" And pray, why not ? \u2014 what whim is it that leaves a door open, when there is danger to both of us?\" \" So \u2014 so I This is pretty affection from a sister to a brother ; bnt if it must be so \" \" Ah ! you consent ?\" \" Well, I was going to say that if you can make fee five hundred pounds a thousand \" \" No \u2014 no I I cannot.\" \" I wiU not close the door upon the providence feat may send my husband to these rooms.

Then you have not told him of my visit, or who and what I am ?\" \" I have not\" \"Good, good! Then I am safe\u2014 quite safe! Ha! ha! I feel quite safe now!

For a time poor Edith and fee world were sepa rated, and she was as if death had relieved her from the embarrassment that preyed upon her. Then the door of fee room opened. Felix Heron, wife a slow and stately step, en tered the room. him and giving the alarm she had threatened, she only shrank back a pace or two with terror.

Give me the money, and let me be off.\" \" You promise ?\" \"Oi course I do.\" His face was deathly pale. His lips even had lost their colour. He looked old \u2014 much older than ho had looked only a few short hours before. The trembling of bis hands showed how much he suffered. He had heard, in the voice of a man, some one in that room \u2014 in that chamber \u2014 the sacred cham ber of his house \u2014 his home \u2014 of his wife \u2014 say \"Good night, Edith!\" He waa not mad. He never had been subject to delusions. His senses were acute, young, and perfect Either some fiend mocked him, or he heard those words. Then it was that, for a moment, his brain seemed to be on fire. Then it was that his heart had seemed to cease to beat \" On your soul's salvation ?\" \"Now, really, Edith, this is too bad. I would just ask you if a man is not just as likely to break an oath as a promise ? Here, you think me no end of a reprobate, and you want me to take solemn oaths ; Be content ; I wiU trouble you no more.\" He slowly opened the door of the room and entered. He closed the door very gently behind him. \" No. You shall swear it\" At first he did not see Edith. \" Tueh \u2014 tushl The money \u2014 give me fee money.\" \"No. Tbe oath.\" She lay so still, in tte position ebe had fallen when that insensibility came over her. That swoon was a mercy to her at such a time, for she could not see the look of despairing agony that was upon the face of him she loved so weU. The face of Felix Heron. \" Well, then, I swear ?\" \" By heaven ?\" \" I swear, then, by heaven, that I wUl trouble you no more !\" \" Take the money.\" Edith removed the handkerchief that had seemed to be lying so carelessly upon a chair, not half-a dozen paces from him, and John Tarleton to his mortification saw feat it hud been the only means of concealing from him the bag of gold he covtted. \" Good night \u2014 good night I\" he said, as he clutched the gold \u2014 \" good night, sister 1 Ha, ba ! I won't stay to count the money, because I will take your word for it. Good night, and pleasant dreams to you.\" Edith could not say \" good night\" She only made a slight movement with one of her hands, by way of a dismissal. John Tarleton had reached the door leading into the next room, from which be had the secret means of leaving the house; and Edith had just began to breathe a Uttle more freely, when there came a low, gentle tap at fee door of tbe room in which she was. Then Heron, by Ihe dim light of tte pair of wax candles that were on each side of the dressing glass, and which alone Ut up that room, gazed sadly about him. His eyes fell on Edith. He uttered a sharp cry of despair. \" Ediih ! oh, Edith !\" Was she dead. Had remorse or the heart's agony brought her to this ? Did she hear his footstep, and feeling convinced that he must have overheard a some thing, had she voluntarily taken leave of tbe world by self-murder ? \"Edith! oh, Edith!\" What a world of agony was in the tone ! Felix Heron stooped and raised her from the floor. How pale and wan she was. How unlike the Edith whom he had loved so weU ! Had, say we ? \u2014 oh, no, no ! a thousand times, no ! Not in the past must that term be used- He loved her still. Who was it ? Not a servant, 6urely ! No one was likely to have any errand there at such a time. The tap at the door, too, was different from that which they would make. If expression could be given by such a sound, we should say that about that tap at Edith's room door there was something inexpressibly touching and mournful. Tenderly aud gently he placed her in one of tte large chairs, covered with rich velvet, that made so conspicuous a feature in that apartment, and then he held her from falling as he spoke to her, with a hcpe that his words might stUl reach her senses. He could not believe but that while life at all lingered about her heart, she would be sure to hear him. Then there came the sound of a voice fromwife ont \" Edith ! Edith ! Edith !\" \" Edith, speak to me ; or, if you cannot speak to me, at least Usten to me, and to let me know that you do so, make some sign, however slight\" She did not move. It was Felix Heron's voice- Edith uttered a scream of terror. \" Good night, Edith,\" said John Tarleton at the .ame moment and he disappeared. \" Lost I lost ! Oh, heaven, lost 1\" cried Edith. She did not speak. There was no sign. Then Felix Heron tenderly placed her against tbe back of fee chair, eo that she could not fall, and from the dressing-table he procured a bottle of pungent essence. Her senses forsook her, she feU to fee floor, and lay upon her face in a swoon.

CHAPTER XXVII. \"Edith! Edith!\" \" Oh, heaven!\" \"Thank God!\" CAPTAIN HERON FINDS THAT TROUBLES COME IN BATTALIONS, AND EDITH CONSULTS LADY CASTLE- NEAU. Edith looked imploringly in tte face of FeUx Heron, and in low gentle tones he spok-e again. \" Are you surprised, Edith, that I cry thank God ? I wiU teU you why I do so. It is because your first thonght was of heaven.\" \" Felix ! Felix !\" Felix Heron was inexpressibly shocked at these last words fr.m Edith. Nothing in all the world could possibly have beeu further from his intention than to injure a single hair of her head. \" I am here.\" But he intended to search those private apart ments for tbe intruder that Edith had, iu fact, ad mitted bad been there. \" You do not love me now ?\" \" Edith, is that your voice I hear ?\" She wrung her hands and wept \u2014 wept like some child, or some young heart that feels its first real grief, and Felix Heron let her sob. He thought it was better that he should do so, for tbe over charged heart else might inflict a world of suffer ing npon her. And so, in tte course of some few minutes, Edith was calmer, and she was able to speak. \" You are here, FeUx ?\" \u00ab I am.\" \" And \u2014 and \u2014 you have been here \u2014 that is, you came here?\" That that intruder, be he whom he might waa there still, seemed to Heron almost a self-evident proposition. There was but one other door which could con duct any one from that little suite of rooms in Whitcombe House in addition to the one at which he bad just entered, and tbat other door he had locked on the outside from the corridor. That no one had had an opportunity of passing him, and escaping by the door he had come in at Heron felt quite certain. It was, therefore, worth a search to see if any one was hidden in the rooms. She wanted to ask how long he had been there and what he knew, but her heart failed her. But, as we say, Heron was inexpressibly shocked that Edith should, for one moment, ima gine his words levelled at her. \"Cm it be possible ?\" he said mournfully \u2014 \" can it be possible that, even now, you know me so little?\" Felix Heron groaned. \"Ah, Felix, Felix, you suffer !\" \" I do suffer \" \" For \u2014 for me, or for yourseU ? You are ill, FeUx.\" \" No ; but I will answer your half-expressed question, Edith.\" \" My question ?'' \" Yes ; you wished to know how long I had been here, and I will tell yon. I have been here just long enough to hear some one speak to yon.\" \" Oh, horror ! horror !\" \" I have been here long enough to hear a voice say, ' Good night, Edith.' \" \" Mercy ! \u2014 oh, mercy !\" \" Edith, whose voice was that ?\" She turned pale and flushed by turns \u2014 sbe played nervously with her fingers, but she did not \u2014 could not speak. She trembled from head to foot Felix Heron spoke again. \" Edith, whose voice was that ?\" She wrung her hands and wept, but she uttered not a word. \"Oh, no! no! Do not sp\u00b0-ak ia those terms to me. I feel that 1 deserve your censure, Felix.\" \" Hush !\u2014 hush !\" \" But, Felix \" \" Nay, Edith, say nothing to me. There is a feeling at my heart which I dread. Sit still. Sit still, 1 say ! I have my honour to look to.\" Heron drew his sword. Edith said nothing now to stay him from his purpose, which she comprehended was to search those rooms. She felt confident that nothing could have saved John Tarleton from death if he were there ; but, at the same time, she felt confi dent that be had escaped by that secret mode of ingress and egress from Whitcombe House which he had boasted of having discovered. Bat it was a terrible situation for Edith to see Felix Heron searching for her supposed lover in those apartments so sacred to their domestic occu pation \" You wiU not tell me ?\" \" I \u2014 I \" She seemed choking in the effort to reply to him. \" I \u2014 dare not\" \" But there was a voice?\" She had never thought it possible cruel fate had such a par g in store for her. Heron, in a few seconds, convinced himself __** there was no one in the rooms. \"There was.\" \"And it said, 'Good night, Edith?' \" \" It\u2014 it\u2014 did.\" And if Edith had denied feat any one bad been there, he would have probably reasoned himself into the belief that his imagination had conjured up the words he had really heard. But Edith could not speak falsely to FeUx Heron. \" Here, in this room, or in these rooms that com municate one wife the other ?\" \" I may not deny it, Felix.\" Heron sighed deeply. \" WiU you sit quiet, Edith, while your husband endeavours to preserve his honour ?\" Edith uttered a cry of dismay. There was a terrible look upon fee face of Heron. \" Oh, no, no, Felix ! You do not mean to kill me ! You wUl bo bitterly repent !\" Truth and her pure heart were to. old and at tached friends to part so easily. She might feel the necessity of not communi cating a something to him, but she could not deceive him. Tbe two things were widely different Felix Heron now approached her again. \" Edith, will you answer me?\" She shook her head, and the tears fell fast from her eyes."], [84, "78 EDITH HERON, \" I want to know, Edith, what is the meaning of all this?\" \" And yet ?\" \" Yet I a6k you to have faith in me.\" \" Ought you so to ask me ?\" Edith looked in the eyes of Felix Heron with the greatest tenderness and grief ; and thi n tier heart could no longer bear fee terrible dialogue, and she flung herself upon her knees to the floor, and shrieked, and sobbed, and called upon heaven to help her. \" I cannot tell you.\" \"You cannot?\" \" No, no ; I cannot \u2014 I dare not ; and yet\u2014 oh ! yet, it is possible, U\u2014 if you would grant me a favour\" \" A favour ?\" \" Yes, Felix. Do you remember, or have you more graciously forgott m\u2014 and it would be surely more gracious to forget \u2014 that you made, on the night that your father, the late Earl of Wnit combe, was found wounded to fee death in this house, a vow to heaven that you would be re venged upon his \u2014 his \u2014 enemy ?\" \" His murderer !\" \" I know not,\" said Heron, \" what aU this passion may mean, but I feel that it wrings my heart too much for me to witness it Edith, farewell!\" \"No\u2014 oh, no!\" \" Farewell, I say ! This is now no home for me, Edith.\" \" Yes, yes ! Your home, Felix \u2014 yours only.\" \" It is no home for me, if it be stiU a home for you.\" Edith struggled to her feet. Those words surely had a terrible meaning. \" Do not misunderstand me, Countess of Whit combe !\" added Heron. \" Yes ; his\u2014 his \" \" His assassin.

But of one thing, Edith, I ought now to feel assured ; and that is \u2014 that is, that some other more than shares with me your affection ; nay, haa enthralled your fancy ; and, but that the supposition is too wild and visionary, I might be led by jour words to think that that other was my father's murderer !'' \" Forbear ! forbear ! \" Then once more, Countess of Whitcombe, farewell.\" He moved towards the door. Edith flew after him. She grasped him by the arm \u2014 she looked despairingly at him, and she spoke most sadly and imploringly. \" By the memory cf the dear love you once had for your Elith, sho asks but one favour.

The hour was late ; but in an aristocratic, mansion like feat there were always some persons up and stirring, and ready to obey any order. And there was that about the tone of the Earl of Whitcombe, as he gave fee order for the carriage, which let those know who heard it that it was a command not to be trifled with. \" There was.'' In twenty minutes the carriage was at thi door. \" A man ?\" \" A man.\" Felix Heron had retired to his library, where he shut himself in. \" Who said ' Good night, Edith ?' \" \" Who said ' Good night, Edith.'

I have had occasion more than once to tell you that I specially dislike this perpetual wordy gratitude. Let me hear no more of it I\" Le Jeune bowed low. Then he shut himseU in fee room again, and, sitting down by a table, he rested his head upon his hands, and sighed and moaned. He started suddenly to his feet The carriage had driven off. Edith was gone. Weuld she ever come back again ? Oh, terrible question ! And yet it was one feat rose up to his heart en the moment that he heard fee sonnd of fee carriage- wheels and of the horses' feet that took her from Whitcombe House. Felix Heron fixed on him a searc'iing look. \" What is fee time ?\" he said. \" Past twelve, my lord.\" \" Where were you at ten o'clock ?\" Le Jenne started. \" Edith ! Edith !\" he cried ; \" come back to me ! \u2014 come back to me ! I wiU think nothing, believe nothing to your prejudice, even though all my senses should combine against you ! Edith, come baok!\" \" At ten, my lord?\" \" Yes. Between fee hours of nine and ten where were you?\" \" Here, my lord.\" \"Here ?

Alas, no I If my own poor word does not suffice, I have no evidence, good my lord. And yet \u2014 yet now I think of it I was not very weU just as fee clock was striking ten, and I wanted a glass of water; and, looking out at that door to see if any of fee servants were within caU, I happened to see passing the waiting woman of my lady the Countess, and she brought it to me ; so that there ia, my lord, a sort of evi dence that I was here in this room at ten o'olock.\" But she was gone. A blight fell upon the heart of Felix Heron. But had Edith left Whitcombe House in such a manner, and never sought to say a kindly word to Heron before she did so ? Ah, no! That would have been aU unlike Edith, She had sought him ; but, at the foot of fee grand staircase, she had met fee villain Le Jeune. Of him she asked where Heron was. Le Jeune bowed low with well-acted humiUty. \" The Earl, my noble master,\" he said, \" left the house in haste a few minutes' since.\" Edith sighed. \" He will not see me again ! \u2014 he will not speak to me again ! Felix ! \u2014 Felix ! \u2014 Felix !\" The carrriage was at the door. She Grossed tte hall \u2014 she crossed tte threshold \u2014 she descended the steps. Felix Heron rang the bell. A footman answered fee summons. \"Bid the Countess's waiting- woman to come hither.\" \" Yes, my lord.\" Le Jeune waited with a composed look upon his face, while he slowly rubbed his hands one over the other. Well did he know feat fee evidence of that waiting-woman would be in his favour, for he had told her just what to say, since between him and her there waa, aa has been before hinted, a capital understanding. In a few minutes the waiting-maid appeared \u2014 that same waiting-maid who had listened so very industriously at the keyhole of Edith's chamber door. \" To Castleneau House I\" The footman touched his hat Another moment, and the vehicle drove off. Edith was resolved to tell her aunt, Lady Castle neau, aU ; and to abide by her advice. It was impossible, after the error she had com mitted in concealing at aU from Heron the visit of John Tarleton to Whitcombe House, that sho could have come to a wiser determination than the present one. Felix Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, paced fee magnificent library of Whitcombe House with hasty steps, and ever and anon he struck his breast, and uttered low moans of anguish and despair. Alas, poor Heron! Alas, poor Edith ! A hundred such men as John Tarleton were not worth one hundredth part of the pain and misery that those two noble hearts suffered. \" Answer me,\" said the Earl \u2014 \" have you been in this room before this to-night?\" \" No, my lord.\" \" Ah !\u2014 indeed !\" \" Yet, my lord, now I think of it, at about ten o'clock your lordship's secretary here opened the door just as I was passing, and asked me for a glass of water, which I brought him ; so that I was in the room for a moment ; but I did not touch anything, my lord.\" \" That will do. Go !\" The waiting-maid left The Earl of Whitcombe clasped his right hand over his eyes for a few seconds, and then he said, \" AU this is very strange Am I subject to delu sions on this night, of aU others ?\" \" My lord !\" \" I could almost have sworn that I heard your voice on Blackheath to-night, close to Shooters' HiU!\" CHAPTER XXVIII. FELIX HERON HAS POISON INSTILLED INTO HIS MIND, WHILE EDITH MAKES A CONFESSION TO HER AUNT. There came a low, Ught tap at the door of fee library. Heron did not hear it for a moment \" Oh, dear 1\u2014 oh, dear ! My good lord ! I on Blackheath I\" \" WeU, weU, I am convinced I was wrong. It was repeated. Le Jenne conghed. \" Come in I\""], [86, "EDITH HERON. 80 \" Does your lordship forget feat the Earl of Bridgewater is in fee home ?\" \" The Earl of Bridgewater ! Good heavens, yes ! Where is he ? where is he ?\" \" In the green drawing-room, my lord !\" \" Surely \u2014 surely, my reason is departing from me! How could I forget the presence of my dearest friend ?\" Felix Heron had hastened to tte green drawing room ; but instead of the Earl of Bridgewater being there, he found a note on tte table, contain ing the following words : \u2014 That she had parted with some of her Jewels to lhat person, he likewise found out. And that was a discovery that he made iu a very singular way. In a street leading out of St. James's Street, there was a gaming-house, at that period kept by a man who was reputed to be the worst of hia class. The very bad character of thia house was to Le Jeuue a recommendation. When in tte service of the Bishop of Worces ter, he bad been in the habit of attending it ; and when now he had succeeded in getting into the confidence and the service of the Earl of Whit combe, he did not give up the habit. \" My Dear Whitcombe, \" Pray excuse my unceremonious leave-taking. While in this room, waiting for you, I have be eome cognisant of a circumstance that induces me to leave hastily, In order that I may fee better comprehend it. I wUl see you some time in the course of to-morrow. About two nights before this one, when so sad a scene had taken place between Felix Herou and hia Edith, Le Jeune, at about one in fee morning, was at the gaming honse. There he observed a dissolute-looking, fashion ably attired young man, who was playing deeply and recklessly. He lost, of course. Coming, then, to the end of a tolerably well stocked purse, this gambler wanted to speculate still further upon tte cards- Taking from his pocket a diamond brooch, of a peculiarly beautiful character, and which was easily identified by having a small ruby iu tte centre of a cluster of brilliants, he cast it on the table, saying, \" Who wUl play a hundred gold pieces against that toy ?\" Le Jeune knew tbe ornament at once. \" Believe me to be ever your sincere friend, \" Bridgewater.\" This note was by far too ambiguous for Felix Heron to comprehend to what it alluded \u2014 unless, indeed, it had some relation to those most sad and mysterious circumstances which were casting the shadow of their terrible presence between him and his Edith. As Felix Heron read tte note again, nothing could be more probable than that he should be lieve such to be the purport of it. \" More grief I more grief !\" he said. \" I am certain, now, that Bridgewater has become aware in some way of some fearful confirmation of my worst fears I\" He had seen Edith wear it. \" I !\" he cried, \u2014 \" I will chance so much gold against that glittering toy.\" \" Agreed.\" The play began, and ended. Le Jeune was a much more crafty and ex perienced gambler than John Tarleton, and the oonsequence was what might be expected. Le Jeune won the stake- With disordered steps, and such a look of dejec tion that he surely would have excited pity iu any human breast, Heron returned to the library. There, however, there was one human breast feat knew no pity. The villain Le Jeune ! What cared he for the agony that was depicted upon the face of that master who had been to him kind, and indulgent and considerate ? What cared he for fee hearts that might break, or the Uves that might be quenched, provided he could cany out, in conjunction with Warring dale, the designs for which tbey were now asso ciated Elated by the possession of an article that had belonged to Edith, he had then left the gaming table, and revolving in his own mind what to do, he told himself over and over again that Edith waa beautiful. For once the cold and crafty nature of this mau of many crimes was touched by the power of loveliness. Le Jenne wanted to ruin the happiness of Felix Heron, both on his own account and on account of Warringdale. Out of the misery that would ensue if he, Le Jenne, could only compass such an act as the eternal separation of Edith and Heron, it was pos sible that some fresh doubts might be cast upon tte legitimacy of Heron, and in that case the claim of Warringdale to the peerage and estates might be revived. The idea came across him that he had Edith in his power. Foolish idea enough ! He knew not Edith ! But to the coarse, common perceptions and in stincts of Le Jenne, who had no faith in hnman excellence or in human nature, Eiith must needs make some terms with him. Therefore was it that on fee next morning he sought his opportunity, and approached her, in his usual crawling, slow, shrinking manner. He showed her the ornament of brilliants. Neither Le Jeune nor Warringdale knew what Jonathan Wild was about And she recognised it at once. A cry of pain escaped her. \" Lady,\" said Le Jeune, \" you will see feat I know something. You wUl comprehend feat I am aware of a secret that might be interesting to many persons. What will you give me to keep it locked up for ever and ever in my ovvn heart ?\" Edith thought, to be sure, that this man had discovered her brother, and knew that he was fee person who had kiUed the late Earl of Whit combe. Indeed, fee thief-taker, feeling feat now his interests and Warringdale's were antagonistic, took excellent care not to encounter him. And there was one circumstance feat made all fee malevolence of Le Jeune's nature rise up in arms against poor Edith. It was just this. By peeping and prying in Whitcombe House, and by the assistance of the waiting-maid, with whom he had estabUshed an intrigue, Le Jeune had found out feat, by some extraordinary means, Edith had had an interview wife some one in fee rooms above the reception saloons. There was no other soul to know or to guess at, feat occurred to Edith She sighed deeply."], [87, "81 EDIT] IER0N, __\u2022 ~M,\" As saVJ, nnd there was a look of scorn a-prci her face as she spoke, \u2014 \" ii you require gold K> n-dooe yon not to do much present mischief, yon shall have it!\" \"No, no I\" \" Yon do not ?

He had declared a \"Lady!\" \" What would yon say ?\" \" The person to whom, doubtless, yon gave this bauble is dear to yon ?\" \"Alas, alas! what can I say?\u2014 yes and no to geUier.\" Le Jenne was puzzled wife this answer ; and then, after a few moments' thought, he said to himself, \"Ohl this is one of those infatuations Vo 11.\u2014 Edith HEBOiit"], [88, "82 EDITH HERON. pasnien besom he knew that it would receive a favourable return.

But, clwer aud acute as Le Jeune was, be was yet rather a novice in affairs of the heart and feelings. He was boiling over with rage ! He swore re venge \u2014 revenge, bitter, deep, and lasting ! At first, though, he had his fears that Edith would go direot to fee Earl of Whitcofube and relate what had passed; in whioh case, what would he not have to fear ? Bnt he bides his time.

Le Jenne was right Poor Edith dared not teU her hnsband feat his servant had insulted her. \" You don't drink, Boom,\" he said. \"I tell you, man, that if you don't drink, you wiU never enjoy life \" \" I should bave but little enjoyment of it, if I did,\" replied the attorney. \"Why not?\" \" Just because it T_..uld very soon put me out of life altogether.\" \" Pshaw !\" She was reaping the bitter crop of concealment and secrecy which aha had sown. Not a word passed her Ups to Heron in regard to the audacity of tte secretary ; and, as the day passed on, and Le Jenne felt certain Edith must have had several opportunities of communicating his conduct to the Earl, but had not done so, he smiled to himself, as he muttered, \" I am safe ! I am safe ! It is too late now !\" \" It's all very well Mr. Wild, for you to cry pshaw ! who are accustomed to drink, but I am not\" \" That's just it.\" \"What is just it?\" \" You won't accustom yourseU to it. I am seasoned\u2014 why should you not be? What is brandy made for but to drink ? and why don't you and everybody el6e get accustomed to it, as I do?\" \" It is not worth while, Mr. Wild.\" \"It is.\" Nothing could have happened worse for Edith than this circumstance. Before that Le Jeune, so to speak, was but doing the work of Warringdale. Now be had hatred and malice against poor Edith on his own account \" Indeed it is not ; and less than worth while is it to argue the point, Mr. Wild.\" \" Call me Lord Wild 1 No, no\u2014 not Lord Wild ; Lord Whitcombe ! That's to be my title. CaU me Lord Whitcombe !\" And so. when Felix Heron, with fee little note that the Earl of Bridgwater had left for him in his hand, returned to the secretary, he found Le Jeune ready and willing to do all the mischief in his power. The evident distress ef fee Earl of Whitcombe moved him not to one gleam of pity. The attorney rose. \" Good evening, Mr. Wild.\" \"What? what? Where are yon going now?\" \" Anywhere, so that it is away from you. I know well that when you ask me to call you Lord Whitcombe, you have taken more than enough to do you good, and that aU compliance with you ia ont of the question.\" \" No, no ! Yon are wrong. Hang it, then ! there goes the bottle under tbe grate. Come, now, what have you to say ? I am cool as ice, and calm as a street-post What is it ?\" \" Then, Jonathan, we are making progress.\" \"Ah! Good!\" CHAPTEB XXIX. MR. ROOM AND JONATHAN WILD CONCERT FURTHER MEASURES OF MUTUAL VILLANY. While all this was going on at Whitcombe House \u2014 whUe a chasm seemed to be opening, and widening, day by day and hour by hour, between Felix Heron and his much-loved Edith \u2014 Jonathan WUd and his attorney, Mr. Boom, were far from being idle. . .They sit together in those chambers where Wild had found a refuge after his escape from the old abbey at Westminster, and they congratulate themselves. \" I have had an interview with the Lord Chancellor \u2014 a private and confidential interview. I don't know how it is, but it seems to me that he has eome prejudice against fee Earl.\" \u25a0 \"The who?\" \" The Earl of Whitcombe.\" \"That's me!\" They are making progress. Wild diinks deeply. He has a bottle before him, fee neck of which he has struck off against the edge of the table, and from which he is imbibing raw brandy. Tbe whole atmosphere of the chambers is full of the strong spirit But Mr. Boom will not drink. \" No, no ! I mean Felix Heron, who holds fee title at present \" \" Then why Oon't you call him FeUx Heron ?\" The attorney got up again. \" Mr. Wild, 1 peictive feat you \" \"No, you don't!\" ciied Wild. \"You perceive nothing but that you must stay here ; for, if yon don't, 1 wUl knock you down ; so be warned in time.\" Cool, calm, cold, and white-looking, he sits and thinks, for he feels the importance of having all his viits about him \u2014 ay, and as many more as nature has possessed him wife, if it were possible to procure tbem. He is playing a deep and crafty game. Mr. Boom is too much for even Jonathan WUd, ts Jonathan will probably soon find out The attorney resumed his seat \" Now, go on, Boom \u2014 go on I\" The attorney spoke in a tone of vexation. \" I say, I have Been the Chancellor, and en trapped him into a conference He was very angry when he knew what it was about, because he said the whole affair might came before him judiciaUy,"], [89, "83 EDITH HERON. and therefore he ought not to receive any private communications on the subject.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" price. The Dutch, however, sent over here a certain Mynheer von Geytt to accommodate mat ters ; but it did not suit the Secretary and his friends that Myneer von Geytt should arrive bo soon by twenty-four hours, as he would have done if not interrupted.\" \"Well; what then?\" \" Two letters were sent to me at my house, Little Newgate: one urging me to capture a smuggler, who would land at Dover, and pretend to be a Dutch emissary , and the other, a private one, telling me uot to listen to anything he could say, but to keep him my prisoner, anywhere, a day and a night\" \" You did it ?\" \" Yes. But btill I found that he wanted to know it all, and I took care he did.\" \" What all ?\" \" Why, that there was another heir to fee titles and estates of Whitcombe to be sought\" \" Sought ? \u2014 Bought ? Did you not say he was fonnd ? Here I am 1\" \" I insinuated he was found, or could easily be found when wanted.\" \u00ab Good ! Go on.\" \" But it would not have been quite discreet to say that he would be found in the person of Mr. Jonathan WUd.\" \" Oh, yes, I did it ; but the Dutchman never knew who I was. I took him to a little lonely cottage, haU-way between London and Dover, and kept him the time specified, and then let him off. There was a terrible fuss about it; and I fancy the Secretary is even now afraid the affair will come out, and wants fee letters.\" \" No doubt\" \" Certainly not ! You are not a fool, Boom !\" \" Thank you!\" \" Oh, don't mention it ! Go on.\" \" I fonnd that the Chancellor was aware of some proceedings only a day or two ago in Epping Forest, in which fee\u2014 the Earl WeU, well don't speak \u2014 I mean, Felix Heron showed a dis position to resort to his old practices of a high wayman.\" \" Ha ! ba ! Thaf s good !\" \" And the Chancellor said that the King was in a state of great irritation against him ; and added that there was some suspicion that some daring highway robberies that were taking place on Black heath might be attributed to some of Felix Heron's gang\" \"Ho! ho!\" \" He shall have them \u2014 at a price, he shaU have them.\" \" Shall I take them to him ?\" \" Oh, no I\" \" Then how wUl he get them ?\" \" I wiU take them myself. Good night ! I'm off to my house in Newgate Street I knew just where to lay my hands on them.\" \"Bnt do you not know that your house in Newgate Street is in tte hands of the officers ?\" \" Not a doubt about that. Give me a pen and ink and a sUp of paper.\" The attorney gave WUd writing materials, and he wrote on tte paper, \" Mr. Jonathan WUd \u2014 on secret service.\" \"So feat altogether, in an interview of more than an hour with fee ChanceUor, although he repri manded me for coming to him as all, I rather think I left a very bad impression on his mind in regard to Felix Heron.\" Wild laughed. \"Boom, you are a capital fellow. It'a deuced awkward, though, for me that I am compelled to keep so quiet here What does the Government mean by persecuting a feUow in this sort of way, I wonder ? Who is to catch their men when they want 'em, now that they have chosen to put a re ward on the head of Jonathan WUd ?\" At the foot of these worda WUd appended what looked like a signature, but waa such a terrible scrawl, that no one could have made anything of it. \" Now, Boom,\" he said, \" have you no old deed, or parchment, from which you can take some im posing-looking stamp or seal ?\" \" I could do such a thing.\" \" Quick, then ; let me bave it\" Boom soon produced to Wild a very pretentious looking stamp, and a seal aa well, both of which Jonathan fastened to tte slip of paper ; and then he put on his hat and glared about him. \" My argument ! \u2014 my argument !\" \"Your what?\" \" I was coming to feat\" \" To what ?\" \" Your affair in feat particualr. I called on the Secretary of State about you, with the hope feat he would put an end to fee prosecution.\" \"Ah! Well?\" \" He is furious !\" \"What about?\" \" Oh, there it is !\" The short club-like cudgel, feat Jonathan Wild was in the habit of carrying about wife him, was in a corner of the room. It was a fancy name, that of his \" argument,\" that he gave it \" Now I'm all right\" \" Be cautious !\" \" About those blank warrants feat you used for your own purposes.\" \" A plague upon him and his blank warrants !\" \" Yes. But there is another matter.\" \"What is feat?\" \"The Secretary, I fancy, thonght that I knew where you where ; and he said feat if two lstt-rs that he wrote to you in the spring of the year could be found and given up to him, he should feel in clined to advise fee abandonment of the pro secution against you.\" \" Two letters ? Two letters ?\" \" Ha ! ha ! No ; that is fee very thing feat I won't be, Boom ; but I will be insolent, daring, and audacious. Those are fee quaUties that suc ceed.\" Jonathan Wild, without another word, left the chambers in fee Temple \" He said two letters.\" He had quite made up bia mind in regard to the course he meant to adopt to get free from the prosecution that had compelled him to be perdu for so leng. Without going an inch out of his way, or seeking to avoid any one, he made his way to Newgate Street ; and Jonathan Wild's progress afforded a notable example of what coolness and audacity wiU accomplish, for no one interfered wife him. \" Ah, I have it ! The Ambassador from the Netherlands. I have it! I have it! Hurrah!\" \"Are you mad?\" \" No ! But I am a free man !\" \" How so, Jonathan Wild ?\" \"I will tell you. Last spring there was some fear of a war with Holland, and in consequence, the English and fee Dutch funds sunk to a low"], [90, "84 EDITH HERON. with his teeth , and being satisfied that it was a genuine coin of fee realm, he had no longer any objection to going over fee way with the folded paper to WUd's house. \" You will ask if Mr. Wild is at home ; and then, whether or not yon will leave fee letter for him.\" \"All's right P \" Come over here then, and tell me what they say, and yon shall have another sixpence.\" \" Gammonl I'll beUeve feat when I see it.\" He reached Newgate Street He had actually passed the gate of the prison of Newgate, so well known too aa he was ; and he fairly turned the corner of the street, and stood upon fee door-step of his own honse unmolested. \" Impudence for ever !\" said WUd. \" Here goes!\" He gave, then, a startling knock at tbe door. Perhaps there was a something abont tbat knock whioh Jonathan WUd gave at the door of his late residence in Newgate Street, which was familiar to those who were in fee house. Certainly, WUd heard a great clatter within, as if his demand for admittance had produced suffi cient consternation to bring down a portion of the building. WUd laughed. \" That boy,\" he said to himself, \" wonld make a capital fellow for me if I wanted a lad. He believes nothing, and takes nothing on trust from anybody.\" The boy crossed fee way, and knocked one long, single dab at Jonathan Wild's honse. There was rather an inviting-looking bell-handle at the side of the door, the brass knob of whioh the boy could just conveniently reach, and at that he gave a hearty pull. But the bell-handle was treacherous. Some one, by accident or design, had disconnected it with the wire, and fee boy roUed head over heels down fee steps into fee street. \" I know'd there was some sell,\" he said. Bnt the door of Jonathan Wild's honse was opened a short width ; for whoever was there had connected this second knock from fee boy with the first one from Jonathan Wild. \"Yea,\" said a voice, \"what want yon? As the Psalmist says, Then aU was profoundly still. WUd waited about five minutes. He wonld not knock again, bnt he thought it wonld be as weU to ascertain the state of affairs in Little Newgate before he showed himseU. It was not that any of the confidence with which Jonathan had marched from fee Temple to fee City bad deserted him, bnt curiosity got fee better, for fee time, of his desire to get into his old house WUd crossed to the other side of fee way, and hid in a dark conrt that had an arched en trance. He waited there until a boy passed along the street, with feat disengaged air which a bey as sumes when he haa really nothing to do. ' He who knocks and runs away. Will come and knock another day ;' so Uke feat!\" It was no other than our old acquaintance, fee Beverend Mortification Bipon, who opened fee door of Jonathan Wild's house from within ; and the words \" take feat 1\" wife which he finished his observations of what fee Psalmist wonld say. alluded to a jug of cold water whioh he slung over fee boy. Now Wild conld not, situated as he was on fee opposite side of fee way, and rather Inclined to wards the City as fee month of the court was, see who it was feat had opened the door of his house. CHAPTER XXX. JONATHAN WILD FINDS HIS OLD HOUSE IN THE OCCUPATION OF OLD FRIENDS. \"Hot!\" said Wild. The boy stopped. \" Hoy ! Have yon any objection to sixpence, my lad ?\" \"What for?\" The answer pleased Jonathan WUd. If fee boy had said that he had no objection to sixpence, Wild wonld have set him down as anything but sharp ; but his inquiry of \" What for ?\" convinced Jonathan feat he was a lad of intelligence. \" Only to take a letter over the way.\" \"Oh!\" The Beverend Mortification kept well in the passage, and only showed his arm with fee jng. But the boy was not going to pnt np with snob an assault wife perfect patience and equanimity ; so, as he gathered himseU np from fee street he grasped two good hands nls of mud and pebbles, and approaching the partially open door, he said, \" Oh. if yon please, sir, is Mr. WUd at home?\" \" Nay, he is not, and never will be, until, as the Psalmist says, he is at home where there wUl be abundant convenience for lighting a pipe, without even turning ronnd.\" \"Oh, indeed, sir!\" \" Yea. truly. Amen !\" \" Well, sir, I bave something for yon.\" \"Eh? forme?\" \" Here it is.\" \" The sixpence ?\" \" No, the letter.\" WUd folded np a stray piece of paper he had in his pocket in the shape of a letter, and held it ont to fee boy. \" Give ns the sixpence, old chap?\" \" Yon wUl find me here.\" \"Oh, shaUl? Hal ha! Do yoa see anything green about me, eh ? Ha ! ha 1\" \" WeU, then, there is the sixpence.\" \" All's right I Where to ?\" \" That house next to fee wall of Newgate, with the black street-door \" \" Jonathan WUd's honse ?\" \" Yes ; tbat is fee house.\" \" I suppose somebody will try to hit a fellow, or Sing something at him ?\" \" I think not\" \" Well, here goes\u2014 I don't mind I And sixpence is sixpince\u2014 leastways, I hope it is. Yes, it is.\" WhUe speaking, the boy tested the goodness of the sixpence feat Jonathan WUd had given to him \" Yes, sir.\" The Beverend Mortification imprudently opened the door a fe w inches further ; and, in a moment the two handfnls of Newgate Street mud plastered his face. \"Whoop! hnrrah!\" cried fee boy. \"How do you like that, as the Psalmist says ?\" The boy was off before the Beverend Mortifica tion could open his eyes again. \" Well,\" said WUd, \" what's the row ?\" The boy laughed. \" They chucked some water over me, after seU-"], [91, "EDITH HERON, 85 \" What a shame !\" said a female voioe. \"Ha, ha!\" langhed Wild, in his peculiar fashion, \" I know you, at all events.\" That female voice came from the person who had succeeded Mrs. Ogle as lionekeeper and general manager of Jonathan's house. \" Ladies !\" added the Rev. Mortification Ripon,\u2014 \" dear sweet ladies !\" Ing a ohap with the bell-handle ; but I think I gave 'em aa good as they gave ; and now 111 trouble you for that other sixpence.\" \" Here it is. Did any one speak to yon ?\" \" To be sure ! A long, thin sort of fellow said a something or other about what the Psalmist would say, and that was all!\" \" It is enough,\" said Wild. \" Good-bye I\" The boy found there were no more sixpences to be had ; so he went off at once to the corner of Giltspur Street where he collected two pocketfuls of stones, which, for the next half-hour, he sent like musket shots in at the different windows of Jonathan Wild's house. \" Oh, Mr. Ripon !\" \" Oh, yon deluding man!\" There were two females. Wild was at a loss to think who the second one could be. Bnt his uncertainty on that point did not last long. \"Ladies,\" added the Rev Mortification \u2014 \"you, Mrs. Sniggs, and you Mrs. R'pon, I drink to your health. ' When lovely woman,' as the Psalmist says, ' stoops to rum, and finds too late that it betrays ; nought oan soothe her melancholy, or chase her lonely gf;fef a ways '\" \"Ho, ho!\" muttered Wild ; \" now I know you all. Mrs. Ripon \u2014 my own Jezebel \u2014 and that donkey, Mortification.\" Wild, meanwhile, searched all his pockets anxiously ; and at length, in one, he found what he wanted. A skeleton key ! \" That will do !\" He went over the way at once, and in two minutes he was in the passage of his own house. He closed the door carefully ; and then, with his body bent at right angles, and his band behind his light ear, he listened to what sounds might be stirring in that establishment he little thought, only a few hours since, to have visited so qnietly. He heard the murmur of voices from the direc tion of the kitchens at the back of the house. \" Oh !\" said the housekeeper, who was named by the Reverend Mortifi \u25a0ation, Mrs Sniggs \u2014 \"oh, I am afraid of you \u2014 I am really afraid of you I You are a dangerous, deluding man, \u2014 I feel sure you are.\" \" Nay\u2014 nay I\" \" But I say you are ! Shall I mix you another glass, Mr. Ripon?\" \"If it's all the same to you, mum,\" interposed Mrs. Ripon, \" I should just like to make one remark.\" Now the arrangement of Jonathan's house was rather peculiar. The whole of the ground floor was devoted to what he called business ; and he had had a couple of kitchens built out in what had beeu the yard, so that but a very small space was left clear at the back of the house, and a fourth or so of that was taken up by the iron staircase mentioned in a former part of this his tory. \" Certainly, mum What is it ?\" \" That's it\u2014 cat! wretch I beast!\" There was a crash, as of a broken glass, and then a scream, and a general confusion. \" Ladies ! Dear ladies !\" said the Reverend Mortification. \"Don't\u2014 oh, don't! It's dan gerous ! Don't throw the glasses and jugs about The pieces are dangerous ! Tbe basement, and what had originally been the old underground kitchens of the house, were devoted to cells and strong rooms. And Jonathan, as he stood listening in the pas sage of his honse, felt convinced that some people were conversing in the first or principal kitchen. From what the boy had said, Wild easily iden tified the Rev. Mortification Ripon. But who were with him ? 11 ' How happy could I be with either. Were t'other dear charmer away; But white you thus tease me together, lo neither a wurd can I say. But lai, labial, lair Oh, murder! murder! Don't! I \u2014 I Oh. as the Psalmist says, I'm a martyr ! Ladies ! ladies 1 ladies!\" That was the question. Most probably some constables had been placed there by the authorities at Newgate, and the Reverend Mortification had joined company with them. The rivals for the polite attentions of the Reverend Mortification seemed, by the exclama tions that ensned, to have made a simultaneous attack npon him. \" You false man ! \u2022 You wretch ! Yon villain ! Youdeluder! You ugly monster!\" It would be dull work waiting in charge of Wild's honse, and the constables wonld be glad of the society of any one Wild crept along the passage. There were two doors near the end of it But the storm subsided. The Reverend Morti fication seemed to have fallen over some article of furniture into a corner ; for Mrs. Ripon cried out in scornful tones, \" Get np, wretoh ! We have done with you.\" \" Yea, I will\u2014 yea !\" \" Be quiet Oh, Mrs. Sniggs, when one's feel ings get the better of one. and one biles over, one don't know what one does I\" One of those doors led down, by the damp, dark staircase, to the basement of the house, where the cells were. The other opened npon a narrow passage that conducted directly to the kitchens. Wild took this last route, and, as the door was open, he bad no difficulty in doing so. \" An apology, Mrs. Ripon,\" replied Mrs. Sniggs, \" is as good as a wink to a blind horse, as the saying is.\" \" Then we won't say any more about it there's a dear soul !\" The moment he got into the narrow passage he heard the sounds of jollity in the hit hen, much more distinctly than before, and could distinguish different voices. The Beverend Mortification Ripon was speak -ing. \" Certainly not Mrs Ripon.\" \" Mortification ? Mortification, I say ?\" \" Yes, my love !\" \"Ladies! \u2014 d*ar ladies I\" he said, \"you are too ?ood ; for as the Psalmist says, ' What am I but a vessel \u2014 a vessel of wrath \u2014 a kind of pipkin \u2014 yea, a cracked pipkin ?' Yea, there is some mud in this left eye jet\" \" If you were half a man, you would find some more glasses, anc mix me and Mrs. Sniggs some rum punch ; but you are a wretch I"], [92, "EDITH HERON. 86 sniggs was all anxiety to know what it was for. \" My son \u2014 my son ! That little villain, Tom ! sobbed Mrs. Bipon. \" It always gets the better of my feelings whenever I think of Tom !\" \" And mine, too!\" said the Beverend Mortifica tion. \" Bnt I find, and so wonld you, my dear, that a glass of 'old Tom' would go a lung nay towards comforting you in regard to young Tom !\" \" You are a brute !\" \" Indeed you are, Mr. Ripon,\" added Mrs Sniggs ; \" and I do think that you have turned a worse brute than ever since Mr. Grogrum, the Bow Street runner, called here to say they were quite clear that Jonathan Wild must be dead !\" \" Yea, I am sorry he is dead, for 1 had made up my mind to take that rascal by the collar, and get the reward for him. I only wish he was alive\u2014 I would run a mile to see him ; and I would s \u00bby, 'Jonathan Wild, you scoundrel !\u2014 Jonathan Wild you '\" \" Well, what do you suppose he would say then ?\" cried Wild, as he opened the kitchen door just wide enough to put his head in, and to make one of his hideous faces as he glanced at the startled group The Reverend Mortification uttered a yell of dismay, aud fell backwards, chair and all. In so falling, he clutched the edge of the table with a desperate force, so that he carried it over with him. \" Nay, I will mix the rum punch ; and the more willingly, because, as the Psalmist says, 1 feel a sinking myself, which that compound, I fancy, is good for.\" Tho mm punch, which it may be supposed the Reverend Mortification was rather an adept at mixing, acted like oil upon the troubled waters, and peace was restored in the kitchen of Jonathan Wild's house. Little did those three persons thrre assembled imagine, however, that the late proprietor of that little establishment was a listener to all they said. \"Mrs Ripon,\" said Mrs. Sniggs, \"as I was telling yon, of all the raging lions, without any human feeling in them that ever was, Jonathan Wild was the worst\" \" I don't donbt it, mum.\" \"He was the stingiest, the growlingest, the most horrid, ugly, tpenomesl, wild beast that ever you heard of.\" \" I'm sure he was !\" \" Thank you, ladies 1\" said Wild to himself. \" Yea,\" said the Reverend Mortification, \u2014 \" yea, ladies, there is good reason to believe that the oontagious monster is dead and gone.\" \" Not a doubt of it!\" said Mrs. Sniggs. \" And a good job, too!\" said Mrs. Bipon. \" You can't think how he treated me !\" \"No! Indeed?\" \" Yes, bnt I got the better of him. He thought I had no end of bank-notes in the crown of my cap, but he found only some waste paper!\" \" The villain !\" Glasses, jugs, hot water, punch, and two candles, all fell with the table in one crash of confusion. The kitchen was in absolute darkness. Mrs. Bipon and Mrs. Siiiggs screamed in chorus, and Jonathan Wild then closed the door again and kept on the outside of it. For the space then of about three minutes it seemed as if some half-dozen or more people were ei gaged in that kitchen in a battle royal- Then the noise ceased. \" Yea, ladies, he were a villain \u2014 he were a viUain ! But, as the Psalmist says, ont of good springeth something worse Have we not, my dear Mrs. Ripon, got leave to keep this house from the Governor of Newgate; and am not I te be sworn in as an extra warder of the prison, so that I may be here to take care of any prisoners on a special remand who may be able to pay for accommodation ?\" Wild tapped at the door. \" Mrs. Sniggs ! Mrs. Sniggs ! Mr. Bipon .' Mrs. Ripon! Hilloa! hilloa! All of you, hilloa 1\" There was a scuffling noise. \" Is this the way i am treated in my own house, after coming from my lonely grave far awaj to see you all ?\" Two screams and a jell came from the ki chen. Jonathan Wild then opened tho door, and standing on the threshold, to that no ojjb .< nld pass out, he uttered the most diabolical cries and shrieks that bis throat could produce. Then he closed the door again, and feeling for two bolts, which he knew were there, he safely secured it, and calmly walked away to the hall of his house again. \" I ra'her think,\" he said, \" they will keep quiet for some time !\" Wild then ascended to tbe first floor of his re sidence, and after some rumuiagiug, be fonnd an old leather valise, from which he tumbled a number of letters. \" Yes,\" said Mrs. Ripon, \" I admit there is something in that; and I doo't see why we should not do a little business in the way of restoring stolen property, just as Mr. Wild used to do him self.\" \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Sniggs. \"He used to carry on a pretty game, the villatn !\" \" Ladies, a toast I\" cried the Bev. Mortification. \" You have had too much already !\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" Nay, I have not A toast, ladies \u2014 a toast! Fill your glasses, charmers \u2014 fill your glasses ! Here is success to virtue when it gets dear off with the 6wag!\" \" Now, really !\" \" He! he I Yon are a droll creature I\" Jonathan Wild was much amused, and would have been quite willing to drink the toast and sentiment which the Beverend Mortification had just propounded ; but he wanted, if possible, to bear more of what was going on in that kitchen of his house. Among those letters be found one of the two two that related to the circum i-tance that evidently had made more impression on the mind of the Secretary of State than upon his. \" This will do!\" he said. CHAPTER XXXI. Wild would fain have found the other letter, bnt it was not to be seen, and he was forced to be content with the one he had ; which, npon consi deration, he thought would answer his purpoce quite as well, if not better, than as if he had fonnd and produced both of them JONATHAN WILD ASTONISHES HIS UNBIDDEN QUESTS, AND IMPOSES ON THE CONSTABLES. The tosst which had been propounded by the Reverend Mortification Ripon was duly honoured. Mrs Ripon then began to cry suddenly, and Mis."], [93, "BDITH HERON. 87 The officers looked very dubiously at eaoh other, and dii not feel near so sure as they had been of getting anything by tbe capture of Jonathan Wild \u2014 or, indeed, of capturing him at all ; for the bantering tone in which be had addressed them, impressed them with the belief that he considered himself perfectly safe. Wild sauntered down the stairs with all the calmness and coolness in the world, and opening the door of his house, he confronted the officers with snch a hideous and triumphant grin upon his face, that they one and all recoiled from the door step. While he was so engaged there came a violent knocking at the street door of the house- Wild went to one of the windows, and opening a pane of glass which he had constructed so that it worked on a hinge, like a small door, he was able to get a view of the door-step Some half-dozen men were there, whom he at once knew to be officers from Newgate. \" Ah I\" he said. \" They think they have me now, though I don't see exactly how they came to find out I was here at all !\" Wild was not aware that the Reverend Mortifi cation Ripon had made his way out into the yard from the kitchens, and ascending the iron etaii case, had got upon the roof of his house. While there, the Reverend Mortification had written upon a slate, with a piece of chalk, the following words : \u2014 \" Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \" here I am ! Who wants Jonathan Wild ?\" It was Qrogrum then who summoned courage to step forward. \" We're doing our duty, Mr. Wild,\" he said, \" and you would do the same if you were in our piace, and we in yours Copies of tbe warrant for your arrest have been left here, and there, and everywhere up and down, and it wasn't to be sup posed Newgate would be forgotten in the list Yon are my prisoner, Mr. Wild.\" \" You don't say so ?\" \" I'm sorry for it for we've worked together be fore to-day.\" \" Don't mention it\" \"Jonathan Wild is at home. Nab him! I claim the reward. \" Mortification Bipon.\" The loose slate on which he wrote this infor mation, the Reverend Mortification, with more dexterity than any one would have given him credit for, flung right over the wall of the prison of Newgate, the comer of which was close to Wild's roof, and it fell in one of the prison yards, at the feet of a night watch, passing obliquely across his face, and almost taring his nose off in its passage. A very little reflection had sufficed to convince the Bev. Mortification Ripon that it was \" in the flesh\" that Jonathan Wild had returned. The idea of the reward was a stimnlant that he had not the least notion of resisting, and hence the activity and presence of mind whichhe showed on the occasion. \" Then, Mr. Wild \" \" Stop, my dear Qrogrum, stop ! Who granted the warrant?\" \" The Secretary of State.\" \" Oh, indeed ! And its date ?\" \" Not six days ago.\" \" Very well, then \u2014 the Secretary nf State has thought better of it that's all, and has hauded me only this evening a much more important paoer \u2014 a release, my dear friends \u2014 a release in full ; and if you've any curiosity to see it, there it is.\" The officers looked askance at each other. Well they knew Jonathan Wild's audacity and in genuity, and well might they suspect him to be fully capable of the manufacture of such a docu ment as that he boasted of possessing. \" Pray walk in, gentlemen,\" Eaid Wild, still speaking in the same sneering bantering tone he had commenced with ; \"pray walk in, gentlemen. I'm afraid it's cold on the doorstep.\" \"Mr. Wild,\" said Grogrum, \"yon know as well as we do tbat we ought not to let you go, because you produce a bit of paper with some words npon it\" \"Can't you read?\" said Wild. \"Look at the signature!\" \" The signature's past my comprehension, Mr. Wild.\" \" By Jove ! you're right there, Grogram,\" said Wild : \" it's past mine too. But as this paper was given me by the Under Secretary of State, he will not he by any means delighted if you dispute it because he does not write his name very plainly. Good evening, if you won't come in \u2014 good evening!\" \" It won't do, Mr. Wild.\" \"Ah!\" \" No, Mr. Wild, it won't do ; but If you like to stay in Newgate while a messenger goes to the Secretary's office, or to his private house, there will be no objection \" \" Look you here, comrades,\" said Wild savagely. \" I don't choose to cross the threshold nf old New gate as a prisoner; but I won't resist you now, il you choose to take me, because I'm on the right side of the hedge, with this release in my pocket Bnt if yon do take me, there's not a man of yon But Wild was puzzled. \" I wonder now,\" he said, \" if they saw me pass Newgate ? Well it don't matter. I looked for this. We will now see what virtue there is in the protection I have manufactured for myself.\" The violent knocking continued at the door, for although the constables could hardly convince themselves that Jonathan Wild was really there, they were all impatience to verify the fact. Wild now opened the window in the ordinary way, and putting ont his head and half of his body, be said, \" Don't be impatient, gentlemen : I'm here, and have no intention of leaving.\" \" Wild\u2014 Wild ! There he is ! That is Jona than 1\" The officers recognised his voice in a moment \" Oh, yes,\" added Wild ; \" you are quite tight I am here. How very kind of you to come here, for it saves me some trouble ! I was coming round to Newgate, but you will take my compliments to tbe Governor, and spare me the job. ' \"Come, come, Mr. Wild!\" said one of the officers below. \" This won't do.\" \" My dear Grogram,\" said Wild, \" what won't do?\" \" Why all this talk, Jonathan. Time's np for you \u2014 yon've run your race ; and it's jnst as well for us to have the reward as anybody else \" \"Upon my word, my friend,\" replied Wild in a sneering, bantering tone, \"you're very kind. Any one would thick my affairs were in a bad way. But however, as 1 don't like to keep pro fessional brethren waiting in the street I''1 come down and let yon in\" Wild withdrew his head from the window and closed it"], [94, "88 EDITH HEBOV. that III not be even with before the next three months have passed over his head.\" The officers were irresolute, and then one, who had not yet spoken, suggested exactly what Jonathan Wild wanted to bring them to. \" Perhaps Mr. Wild won't object\" he said, \" to get into a haokney coach and come with us to the Secretary of State's house \u2014 not as a prisoner, but a friend and acquaintance, whom we would like to see clear of the troublesome affair ?\" These indications of mirth on the part of Wild made the blood run cold in the veins of the officers , for they had suoh an appreciation of his recklessness and daring, that it would net much have surprised them if he had found seme means of blowing up the hackney coach to their oertain destruction, while he himself wonld alight some where in safety. But Jonathan had no suoh intentions\u2014 -finene, not violence, was the order of the day as regarded him; and the chncklings he indulged in were rather in anticipation of what the Secretary of State would say to them than otherwise. It was a bold game to play, however; but on that score it presented to the mind of Wild its principal attractions. The distance was traversed within the half hour, even at the snail's pace of an old hackney coach ; and Wild could not bnt smile to himself at the manner in which the officers closed about him when they reached the Secretary of State's door, as though they fully expected at that last moment he would give them the slip, and they wonld have to chase him through the streets of London. \"Agreed!\" said Jonathan. The officers felt that this compromise was a great relief. \" I'm perfectly oontent\" added Wild ; \" and perhaps if I were in your place I should be oon tent with nothing less. It won't take ns an hour, and then I invite yon all to come back here and drink success to a new lease, with new life to the old crib, Little Newgate. Ha! ha! we will make a night of it. The charming Mrs. Sniggs, my housekeeper, is here ; and an admirable and exemplary lady, of the name of Ripon, is keeping her company. I'm sure they will both be de lighted to make everything comfortable. Now, old friends, I'm quite at your service.\" The officers scarcely knew what to make of Wild's oonduct bat they began to feel pretty cer tain that he had the means of slipping through their fingers, or he never wonld have placed him self in their hands in the unhesitating manner he did. But Wild walked calmly into the hall; and Grogrum, the officer, having explained the purport of the visit to a sleepy-looking young man in black, who was a sort of nnder clerk to the great man's private secretary, was assured that on no account could the Minister be disturbed, and he suggested that the best plan was to take Jonathan Wild to Newgate, and shut him up till next day. \" But I won't go !\" said Jonathan. He sat down composedly in the leather chair of the hall porter as he spoke. The officers were puzzled. The sleepy-looking young gentleman had said his say, and seemed incapable of any further ex ertion than looking np at the ceiling. \" Mr Wild,\" said Grogram, \" we neither wish to detain you nor to be detained ourselves. Let this young gentleman have the paper you showed us, and he will no doubt take it to the Under Se cretary, who will either say it's all right or all wrong, and then we shall know what to do \" \" Excuse me,\" said Wild ; \" I shall do no snoh thing. But I'll send a note, and this scrap of paper and a lead pencil will just enable me to do it. Have you a pencil, Grogrum ?\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild ; but \" \" Pho, pho, man ! Let's have no buts, bnt hand it over! There, my fine fellow \u2014 that'll do! Give that to your master, and tell him I'm wait ing.\" Jonathan Wild, on rather a dirty slip of paper, which he tore off the corner of an old newspaper he had in his capacious pocket, wrote, with the pencil, merely a name. \" Mynheer von Geytt\" That was all. Of course their disappointment was propor tionate, for if ever they thought a man's career was fairly over, it was in the case of Jonathan Wild. The parley that had taken place on the door step had not been conducted iu very loud tones, and the consequence was that they had not reached either the Reverend Mortification on the roof of the house, or Mrs. Sniggs and Mrs. Ripon in the kitchen. When, therefore, Jonathan Wild left with the officers, and the street door was banged shut behind them, the impression on the part of the ladies was that he was carried off in custody. This impression was, to their perceptions, quite verified by the speedy appearance of the Bev. Mortification Bipon, not at all improved in per sonal appearance by his short sojourn on tbe roof of the house, but with much exultation in his manner, as he informed Mrs. Sniggs and Mrs. Ripon of the ingenious way in which he had brought about the capture of Jonathan Wild. \" Then the monster will really be hanged ?\" said Mrs. Sniggs. \" There oan be no doubt about it, ladies,\" cried the Rev. Mortification ; \" and it's much better to know that than only to suppoie that he must be dead somewhere.\" \" To be sure it is,\" said Mrs. Ripon ; \" it's a pleasant relief.\" \" Yea, ladies, it puts ns ont of suspense.\" \" And him out of his pain,\" said Mrs. Sniggs ; \" for when onoe he's turned off, and his legs well pulled, he'll be happy.\" While these felicitations in respect to what was in store for him were going on at his house, Wild accompanied the officers to Holborn Bridge, where a hackney coach was procured, and, not without sundry misgivings on the part of the con stables that they might still be the victims of some artful plan on the part of Wild, the little party drove to the West End of the town. Jonathan indulged in various hideous chuckles to himself as they proceeded. The sleeping young gentleman looked indig nant. The word \" master \" stnok in his throat. \" What do you mean, fellow ?\" he said to Wild \" Nothing particular, Puddinghead I\" replied Wild ; \" bnt take that paper, folded up as it is, to the Under Secretary ; and if you presume to open it you'd better look out for the safety of your calf's head !\" \" What a low ruffian !\" muttered the olerk, as he took the piece of paper between his singer and thumb, and disappeared from the hall with it \" I'm sorry,\" said Wild, addressing the officer*."], [95, "EDim heron. 8? and crossing one leg over ths other as to sat in the hall porter's chair, \u2014 \" I'm sorry, comrades, tbat I cannot offer you any refreshment here. I dare gay the cellars of this house are pretty well stocked, bat there has been a slight ooolness be tween me and the Secretary of State; and, although we have made mattera up, we're not qnite on the same intimate terms as before.\" For the last ten minutes the officers had felt qnite certain that WUd knew he was safe. All they dreaded was, that beneath that smiling exterior of his. he meditated some revenge against them for the part they had taken in his arrest But before anything more could be said, the sleepy-looking yonng gentleman retained with a puzzled look npon hia face, saying, \" Mr. Secretary wUl see yon in the library.\" \"Of course he will,\" said WUd. \"Mr. Secre tary will see me in the library.

He led Wild into the recess of a window, which was just out of ear-shot of Grogrum and his com panions. \" You're a great scoundrel, Wild !\" where he had the two letters with whioh, in plain truth, he meant to bribe the Under Secre ary of State to cmnive at his release\u2014 he awaited the coming of the Minister. He had not to wait long. There was a troubled look upon the brow of the Under Secretary as he walked hastily into the room, speaking as he came. \"What is the meaning of all this, officers? Why is this man brought here ? I understood he was dead; and if not te should be in the securest cell of Newgate.\" \"So, so, Mr. Wild!\" said Grogrum, as he placed his hand heavily upon his shoulder, \u2014 \"so, so ! This is all a farce ; and it seems you have given us and yourself a deal of trouble for no thing\" \" No so fast, my dear Grogram,\" said Wild. \" This is insufferable,\" said the Under Secre tary. \" Am I to be disturbed by your squabbles one with another? What is the meaning of all this ? Who is the chief among you, that I may hold him responsible ?\" \" I am,\" said Grogrum. \" We held a warrant for the apprehension of Jonathan Wild, but he pleaded a written release from you, and therefore we didn't know what to do\" \" Thank you, Grogrum,\" said Wild ; \" that's just it, put in a few words.\" \" A release from me ?\" exclaimed the Secretary. \"Exaotly so,\" said Wild. \" It's false. I never gave any such release.\" \" The human memory is treacherous,\" added Wild ; \" but sometimes when we forget a thing, if somebody is kind enough to put us in mind of a few little circumstances, however remotely con nected with it the matter aU comes back plainly to our recollection.\" \" This is insufferable insolence,\" said the Secre tary ; \" there is nothing to recollect\" \" Nay, honourable fir ! Bethink you ! It was at the intercession of Mynheer von Geytt\" \"Of whom?\" \" The Dutch Envoy; and at the same time I had the honour to place in your hands two letters, which I have always thought, let what might happen to Jonathan Wild, had better be in the possession of his illustrious correspondent than perhaps fall into some unworthy hands that \" \"Hold!\" oried the Secretary; \"you need say no more. If your object, Mr. Wild, has been to restore me any papers or documents that ought to belong to my office, and you've adopted this mode of doing so in person, 1 quite excuse the act for the motive that has dictated it. Hand me the letters, if you please ; and if, after yonr trial\u2014 for I suppose you will be convicted\u2014 any favourable construction can be put npon your conduct I shall be happy to represent the same to his Majesty.\" \" That wonld be giving a great deal too much tronble,\" said Wild. \"What?\" \" I beg to propose that by far the shortest plan would be not to convict me at all ; and since yon were good enough to sign a release, there need be no trial \" \" What on earth do you mean, Mr. Wild ?\" \"Oh, the matter is quite simple. A treacherous memory is oommon both to gentle and to sim pie ; and therefore, if you, most honourable sir, forget that this release is genuine, and refuse to counter- sign it for the satisfaction of these old friends of mine, whom I have invited to supper to-night, I'm afraid that those two letters will have been for the present mislaid beyond the power of recovery.\" \" I'm perfectly aware of that fact\" \" Tell me in plain language what you want\" \"I should have thought you might have \" Perhaps I do.

An incomprehensible signature is attached to it ; but if you countersign it all will be well; and believe me, Jonathan Wild may do good service yet, although yon consider his character a little tarnished.\" \" You are a hardy villain !\" \"Sir, this is hardly polite, in your own house ; but do you consent?\" \" Of. course, I do. I mnst have the letters. \" Then they are there.\" Wild handed the two letters to the Secretary, without the slightest hesitation ; and the latter, as he bent a keen glanoe npon him, said, \" And pray what is to hiuder me now, Mr. Wild, from leaving yon to yonr fate, for you see I have the letters ?\" \" Oh, dear, no !\" said Wild. \" But I say yes \u2014 I might do it. It seems to me that for ence in a way, you have forgotten yonr usual cunning and caution.\" \"Not at all \u2014 I never was more secnre in all my life.\" \" How so ? Let us hear what desperate in volved piece of cunning you have hatched in that scheming brain of yours. \" \" It is simplicity itself,\" said Wild. \"All I have done, is here beneath his own roof, and before hit, own face, to trust to the word of honour of a gentleman, who in due time will be a peer of this realm.\" A flush of colour came to the face of the Under Secretary. \" And could yon imagine,\" he said, \" rascal that your are, that I intended to play you false ?\" \" Oh, no,\" said Wild, drily. \" I never imagined it\u2014 but you did.\" OHAPTEE XXXIL FOLLOWS EDITH ON HER VISIT TO LADY CASTLE- NEAU, AND DETAILS WHAT CAME OF IT. Jonathan did not miscalculate the effect which the words he uttered would have upon the Under Secretary of State. Perhaps tbat official personage, if he could fairly and easily have seen his way to the pos session of the two letters he wanted, at the same time that he could have sent Wild to Tyburn, would have gladly done so."], [97, "EDITH HERON. 91 But he did not see the way. If he kept the letters, and let the officers take Jonathan to Newgate, he not only had no security that Wild would not speak of the transaction, but he felt quite certain he would. Therefore the Under Seoretary of State put on an aspect of sublime virtue. \" Jonathan Wild,\" he said, \" you know well the real instincts of a gentleman, although you are so far from being one yourself.\" \" Just so,\" replied Wild. \" And therefore you are free.\" \" Of course.\" The magnificent horses of the Earl of Whit combe made short work of the distance between St. James's and Bloomsbury. In what seemed to Edith to be only a few minutes' lapse of time, she was in the court-yard of old Castleneau House. But had she really and truly made up her mind to tell her aunt all ? That was the most important question that, at such a moment, could be agitated. A half-confession to Lady Castleneau would do no good \u2014 a whole one would be certain to elicit some counsel that would put all to rights. We shall see how Edith acted. The manner in whioh Wild took the freedom the Secretary offered him was anything but thanks ul. The hour was a late one for Lady Castleneau ; she had retired to rest ; but no one oould hesitale to disturb her with the news that the Countess of Whitcombe wanted to see her. On the contrary, there was a defiant look about him, and an easy, insolent tone, tbat were any thing but agreeable to the official personage- He turned abruptly from Wild, and addressed the officers. Martha, the attendant upon old Lady Oastie neau, was quite surprised to find her mistress up, and partially dressed. The old lady had retired to rest a good hour and a half before Edith reached Castleneau House. But a strange circumstance had occurred. Lady Castleneau had gone to bed at once upon bidding Martha good night, and with uu wonted facility had, on that particular night, closed her eyes in sleep. It was to dream, however. Lady Castleneau thought that she was walking in a garden, and that she was separated from Edith, who was on another path, by a hedge com posed of roses. She thought that Edith kept calling out to her j that she was so happy that it was only the roses that kept them a little apart. Then Lady Castleneau thought that she heard Edith utter a cry of distress, and upon looking through the hedge of roses the Lady Castleneau saw a serpent, with brilliant and gaudy-looking scales, entwined in a large loop around Edith. The serpent did not seem to touch her; but, as she went onwards, moaning and calling for help, the loop that the elastic body of the reptile made was still about her. \" I recollect now all about it Mr. Wild is right.\" Grogram looked vexed. Wild gave a hideous smile. \" Perhaps, sir,\" he said, \" you will be so good as just put your signature to the paper as verifying its truth that I am free ; for there is an ugly rumour abroad of more warrants than one being out against me.\" \" There is no occasion.\" \" Oh, but there is, so far as my friend, Mynheer von Geytt often said.\" \" Peace \u2014 peace ! There is the signature yon want.\" \" A thousand thanks ; and now, Grogrum, I am quite at your service. Remember, you promised to keep with me to night.\" Jonathan Wild, thus successful, left the house of tho Secretary of State, but not before he had whispered to him a few words. \" Sir, I am in possession of some important secrets in regard to the Whitcombe peerage, which I will take another occasion of communicating to you.\" But we must leave the villain Jonathan Wild to pursue his career, on that his first night of free dom, in his own fashion, while we turn our atten tion to fairer objects. Poor Edith ! And wha: then seemed most strange to Lady Castleneau was, tvat she could see Felix Heron in the same path as Edith, but he was half hidden by a sort of vapour, whioh appeared to prevent him from coming to her assistance. \"Edith! Edith!\" she thought she heard him cry. \" Edith ! Edith ! a breath of yours will surely blow aside this vapour, and I can then come to you !\" Edith, she thought, then replied, \" It is the vapour of death! But I will speak to my dear Aunt Castleneau, and lay my sorrows at her feet.\" Alas, poor Edith ! How melancholy \u2014 how tearful, and at times how agonizing, was that drive to Castleneau House, to see her aunt Lady Castleneau, when ihe left Whitcombe Honse, St James's Street, after the terrible interview she had had with Felix Heron. She looked back upon all her previous life, and there appeared nothing that wore the fearful aspect of her present position. She had suffered mnch when in the midst of all the persecutions whioh were inflicted upon her by her father, Sir John Tarleton, to induce her to wed the wicked Lord Warringdale. But oh ! how insignificant did all those suffer ings seem now in comparison to the anguish which on this night sat brooding at her heart. Perhaps the present pain, be it of mind or of body, is ever considered the greatest and the most serious ; and hence, in presence of that condition of nature, Edith forgot some portion of the past sorrow. Some accidental noise at that moment in her own apartment awakened old Lady Castleneau, and she sat up instantly. The dream had made a deep impression upon her mind. All the inoidents were so vivid. She had seemed to see Edith so plainly, and even no w, that she was undoubtedly awake, she thought she could hear her speak. \" There may be more in all this,\" said Lady Castleneau to herself, \"than meets tbe present comprehension ; but I think I shall see Edith this night\" . That impression was so strong upon the mand of Lady Castleneau, that without oalling for tha assistance of her waiting-maid, she rose and par tially dressed herself, as she was found. But be this as it may, she was now very unhappy. But the carriage sped on its way."], [98, "EDITH HERON. 92 sentimental saying \u2014 in fact many\u2014 that you should speak nothing but good of the dead.\" \" Yes, aunt.\" \" But my dear, that is one of the hypocrisies of the world ! We must speak of the dead, because they have had their say and done their act in the affairs that still surround us ; but there is no reason in the world why we shonld not speak of them at they deserve, my dear Edith!\" \" Perhaps you are right aunt\" \" I think I am, my dear ; and now go on.\" \" Aunt at the time that Felix made that vow, he was full of giief and indignation ; but he is not a man to make heedless vows !\" \"Oh, my lady!\" said Martha; \"here is the Countess of Whitcombe!\" \" I know it\" \" You know it my lady ?\" \" Yes, Martha ; and, if I mistake not tears\u2014 or the traces of recent tears \u2014 are on her cheeks.\" \" Both, my lady\u2014 both.\" \" Let my dear child come here at once. Bring to me the fond, gentle heart that I have adopted as all my own. Edith I Edith 1 where are you ?\" \" Here, dear aunt \u2014 here 1\" In another moment Edith was sobbing npon the breast of her aunt \" Welcome ! welcome, my dear child ! Ever welcome to me ! Heaven's blessings on you !\" Edith sobbed like a child. And whatever had happened \u2014 whatever might be the cause of those tears, right glad was Lady Castleneau to see them, for she felt that the storm of sorrow, be it what it might, was passing away. \" He is not\" \" Then you think he will keep this one ?\" \"Assuredly!\" \" Oh, aunt aunt, that is the grief! \u2014 that is the horror ! Read this letter, which you have already once seen. It is the letter which was found upon my poor father, Sir John Tarleton, after his death. Bead it again, and then I will tell you more!\" The old lady did read it. \" My dear,\" she said, \" this letter recommends to you a bad man!\" \"Alas! alas!\" \"It is but likely and natural, connected so closely with the family as I am, that I should know something of this John Tarleton !\" Edith shuddered. \" As a mere boy,\" added Lady Castleneau, \" he showed a disposition to cruelty and to violence, which pointed him out for some terrible career, and probably some bad end ; when he was at length compelled, although still quite young, to quit the country for a murder.\" \" A murder ?\" \" Even so, my dear child. When he was, I say, compelled to quit England, no one could be sorry that tbe crime was of that magnitude that any idea of his return was out of the question; although, I suppose, from familiarity with the occurrence, your father, in this posthumous letter to you, seems to think it probable he may appear, and come in your way.\" \" He has appeared.\" \"I^leed!\" \" He has come in my way, dear aunt John Tarleton, my brother, is the cause of all these tears \u2014 of all this anguish of the heart\" \"Ah! I begin to see.\" \" No, no.\" \" Yes, my dear Edith, I think I comprehend it all.\" The old gentlewoman, therefore, asked no ques tions of Edith. She only held her in her arms, while the tears flowed, and the sobs found an echo in that reom. And then the sobs became less frequent. The tears ceased. With a deep sigh, Edith was able to look in the face of her aunt. \" You \u2014 you, dear aunt \u2014 you love me still ?\" \" Alas ! my child, what is the meaning of that word ' still,' and the tone of inquiry in which you put the question?\" \" Because \u2014 because\u2014\u2014\" \" Because what dear ?\" \" Because Felix no longer loves me \" \" Hush !\u2014 oh, hush !\" \" But, dear aunt \" \"Nay, Edith, never even permit yourself to utter such words. Being satisfied of the mind and of the heart of Felix, do not let the demon doubt enter your soul.\" \" But he cannot love me !\" \" Cannot love you ?\" \" No ; and he ought not.\" \" Ought not ? Edith ! good heaven, what is it you would insinuate to me? What is it you wonld tell me? My child, do you want to kill me?\" \" No, no !\u2014 oh, no ! I will tell you aU !\" \" Yes ; all or nothing I Bear that in mind, Edith. Whatever you have to say to me, my child let it be all or nothing .\" \" It shall be !\u2014 it shall be ! I feel that now.\" \" And did you not always feel it?\" \"Oh, do not ask me, dear aunt! I have suffered so much \u2014 I have been so distracted, that I know not what to think; but trust me \u2014 believe me, I will tell you all !\" Lady Castleneau would have had Edith take a chair by her side, but Edith preferred sitting on the little footstool at her aunt's feet and resting her head upon her lap, while the old lady, ten derly, kept one hand upon her head. \" Dear, dear aunt when Felix found his own poor, poor father lying dead \u2014 murdered on the staircase of Whitcombe House, he made a terrible vow.\" \" Alas 1 alas !\" replied Edith, as the tears again began to gather in her eyes, \" I fear yon do not\" \" Yes, my dear, you fear that this bad brother \u2014 this John Tarleton \u2014 will be a troub'e to Felix. You naturally shrink from imposing upon him any thing disagreeable in the shape of a reflected dis grace on the part of any relative of yours. That is it, my dear child.\" \" Not alL\" \" Not all ! What more can there be ?\" \" Just this, dear, dear aunt : John Tarleton, my brother, is the murderer of the late Earl of Whit combe I\" Poor Lady Castleneau uttered an expression of grief and alarm. This was a complication that she had not had the least idea of. She bad not had time to connect the various circumstances to gether in suoh a way as to see that there must be something more in the commotion of Edith than merely the little natural embarrassment arising \" He did, my dear ; but it was a very natural one, although the late Earl of Whitcombe, except for the last few months, or year or two it may have been, of his existence, was a man whom no one could regret !\" \" Oh, aunt he is dead 1\" \" I know what you mean, my dear.

But there is one thing that you do not yet seem to know fully.\" \"What is that aunt?\" \"The true nobility of soul of the man who has given to yon his heart and hand!\" Edith slung herself upon her aunt's breast with a cry of joy. It was delightful music to her ears to hear her Felix so spoken of. It was manna in the wilderness. \" Yes\u2014 yes !\" she exclaimed, \" he is all that you say, and more than mortal language can describe. Had he been other than what he is, surely this night he would have killed me.\" \" Did he \u2014 reproach \u2014 you ?\" sobbed Lady Cas tleneau. But now she saw it aU. Now, indeed, she could fully sympathize with, and feel for poor Edith. CHAPTER XXXUI. LADY CASTLENEAU GIVES EDITH GOOD COUNSEL, BUT IT COMES TOO LATE. Fob a few minutes there was a profound silence in Lady Castleneau 's apartment Then that silence was broken by the re newed sobs of Edith. Those sobs aroused all the kindly nature of Lady Castleneau. She rose and lifted Edith with an unwonted strength fairly from the footstool, and insisted npon her sitting in the comfortable, thickly-padded easy chair. \" He spoke more in sorrow than in anger.\" \" Poer\u2014 poor Felix !\" \" Aunt \u2014 aunt !

I thought that I had nothing to do this night but to pity you ; but when I heard your story I fonnd that all you suffered must be immeasurably less than the suffering of Felix.\" \"My shild! my child!\" she said, \"you have suffered, and you suffer much, but we will find a remedy for all this wrong.\" \" Blessings on you for those words of hope,\" sighed Edith, as she strove to control her tears. \" Come now,\" added Lady Castleneau, \" now that I know the worst I must know all the details. Tell me all about it from the first to the last\" \" I will\u2014 indeed, I wiU.\" It was a positive relief to Edith now to detail to her aunt all that had occurred in connexion with John Tarleton, her brother, nor did she omit the little episode of the secretary and the bracelet which had added to her distress. \"Can it be so?\". \" It is so: You have never doubted his faith \u2014 never doubted his affection \" Yes, yes ; I see now !\" \" While he \" \" Do not, dear aunt ; I pray you, say no more- Each word racks my heart 1 Oh, have some pity upon me, dear aunt \u2014 my second mother \u2014 my more than mother, father, brother, kindred, all combined in affection!\" The old lady heard her in silence until she had come to the end of her narration, and then she kissed her tenderly, as she said, \" I cannot wonder my dear girl, that yon suffer, but that suffering must be brought to an end.\" \" Oh, that it could be !\" \" It shall , and must my dear Edith. Not for ten John Tarletona \u2014 no, nor for ten times ten such men \u2014 must your pure and gentle heart be racked.\" \" And he, too, suffers\u2014 Felix !\" \" To be sure. And can yon wonder at it my dear child ? Will it ever be possible for human eyes to look into his heart and know what he must suffer this night ?\" \" Oh, mercy ! mercy !\" Edith hid her face in her hands, and as she did so a vision of all the love, all the tenderness, all the chivalrous devotion of Felix Heron towards her rose np in her mind. She uttered short screams of intense grief and agony of souL \"Hush! hush! my dear, dear Edith ! You come to me for counsel in this emergency ?\" \"I do! \u2014 oh, I do! Only tell me what to do?\" Lady Castleneau rung the bell, the silken cord of which was close to her hand. \" Can I be of any help to you, aunt ?\" \" No, dear Edith ; but I want to order my car riage.\" \" Ycur carriage ? Mine is in the court-yard.\" \" To be sure\u2014 to be sure I I heard the sound of its wheels. Yon were right not to send it away ; for yon must go back at once \u2014 home at once, my dear child, and I will go with you.\" The cleuds seemed to be clearing again from before the sunshine of Edith's life. \" Surely,\" she thought \" the presence of Lady Castleneau will effect something, and Felix Heron will forego the execution of the sentence he has passed npon the murderer of his father.\" Edith began to look quite like herself again. The colour mounted her cheeks; and although she drew her breath in short, checked respirations,. as though a suppressed sob were at her heart, yet she was happier. She began to see daylight through the gloom. The cloud was turning its silver lining towards her. Martha obeyed the call of Lady Castleneau on the moment and the old gentlewoman was soon equipped for the open air. But before she permitted Edith to leave the house, she laid her hand affectionately upon her arm, and said, \" My child, remember I\" \"What aunt? Anything from you!\" -You are to tell all!\" \"What ought to have been done some days \u2022go.\" \"Yes\u2014 yes. What?\" \" TeU all to Felix!\" \"All?

But whereas the time had appeared wonderfully short in the former instance, it now appeared wonderfully long. way being really personally acquainted and fa miliar with an article of the sort. His eyes fell npon it in a moment and the sparkliog of the jewels of which it was so mainly composed, seemed to reflect back his glance with baleful lightnings. He turned deathly pale. He felt convinced that the secretary had some thing to say which would probably inflict a fresh pang upon him. Should he hear it? Should he listen to it ? Edith's anxiety to tell all now to Felix Heron became absolutely painful. Each moment that pissed without the commencement of the reve lations that would surely restore his Edith to him, appeared to her to be an hour of painful suspense She would gladly have alighted from tbe carriage. and striven to outstrip the horses in speei to Whit combe House. That was the question. But if he did not \u2014 what then ? Would it be Alas, Edith ! you need not hasten \u2014 you are al ready too late ! Something has taken place at Whitcombe House which it is now our duty to relate. Tired of all the world, and specially disgusted at the presence of Le Jeune, Felix Heron paces alone the principal drawing-room of his splendid manaion. the less, then, to listen to ? Could he drive it out of his imagination ? \u2014 or would not, rather, that imagination dress it up with a hundred circum s'auces more terrible than any that could really belong to it ? No ; he would not shrink. A communication of that kind was like a danger \u2014ever so much the less in proportion as it was boldly faced. Felix Heron turned his eyes with all the calm ness he could command upon Le Jenne, and speaking in a low, hoarse voice, he said, \" How came you by this bracelet ?\" It was a mortification to Le Jeune to find that there was not the shadow of a suspicion tbat he, the secretary, had got possession of the bracelet personally in any way by favour from Edith, and it added some gall to the bitterness of Le Jeune's reflections that he was quite as much despised by Felix Heron as by Edith. \" You wish to know, my lord,\" he said, \" where I got this bracelet ?\" \" I do.\" His cup of misery was nearly fall. But Le Jenne was quite resolved that that night should not pass away without his pouring into it another drop of poison. As the Earl of Whitcombe paused fora moment in his parade to and fro the drawing-room, he thought he heard some one tapping lightly at the door. \" Come in !\" Le Jeune appeared. \" Away !\" said Heron. \" I want you no more to-night \u2014 your time is at your own disposal !\" \"My lord!\" \" What is it ? Quick !\u2014 what is it ?\" \" My honoured lord, I have something to say.\" \" Which I do not want to hear ; \u2014 so get you gone, and let that answer suffice!\" \" It does, my lord. I only leave this with you, and then obey your orders.\" As Le Jeune spoke, he advanced with the stealthy pace of a cat and laid exactly before Felix Heron, on the table close to where he stood, the bracelet he had sought to barter to Ediih in a fashion the reception of the idea of which by her had so rankled in his heart, that he would have run even some bodily risk to be avenged upon her. \" Will your lordship, first of all, pardon the great liberty I am about to take in asking if you recognise it ?\" \" It belongs to the Countess of Whitcombe.\" Le Jeune bowed abjectly. \" My lord, I got this bracelet from a gambler \u2014 a roue \u2014 a debauche \u2014 a handsome red and white looking man, who boasts that no woman can with stand his blandishments, and who \" The deep groan that came from Felix Heron's breast arrested the remainder of the speech of Le Jeune. The secretary then drew a few paces towards the door, for he was rather afraid of some out break on the part of the Earl of Whitcombe, which might be a little compromising to whoever was near him at the moment Now, he thought, was his opportunity. There was evidently a misunderstanding \u2014 a breach of some sort between Heron and Edith; and all he had to do was to try to widen it \u2014 to make it so wide, indeed, if possible, that it might never be bridged over. Surely if anything would do that, the production of the bracelet would, with some good story full of circumstantial details \u2014 or as many, at all events, as Felix Heron would listen to to back np its presence. But such was not the case- The Earl had by far too much control over himself, and after passing with the calmness that he had throngh all the agitations of that day and evening, it was not likely that he would give way in the presence of snch a man as Le Jeune. He quietly picked up the bracelet from the table, and holding it firmly in his hand in a man ner that showed Le Jenne that it wonld never get into his possession again, he said, \" You tell me you had this from a gambler, a roue, and a debauches\" The Earl of Whitcombe was about the last mau in the world to pay any attention to jewellery or ornaments of any kind or description : he was far from being one of those persons who, at a moment's notice, can give a catalogue of the diess and appointments of their friends and acquaint ances ; and, under ordinary circumstances, Le Jeune, or any one else, might have laid a jewel or ornament before him without its attracting hie at tention or being identified by him in any way. But this bracelet was a speciality. He had himself bought it and presented it to Edith, and after it came into her possession, she had so frequently worn it and called his attention to it that he could not possibly help for once in a \" I had, my lord.\" \" The character of the man is of little moment The information I desire is, how he became possessed of it, for he may have added to those moral qualities you mention, another.\" \" Another, my lord?\" \" Yes. He may be a thief.\" \" Oh, no, your lordship. Of course I cannot vouch for the fact except from hearsay \u2014 but he said a fair lady gave it him, along with her ten-"], [101, "EDITH HERON. 95 derest love, making the brilliants pale with her tears at the time that she could not be whollv his. ' As Le Jeune spoke, he fixed his keen, basilisk tooking eyes Upon the countenance of the Earl of Whitcombe ; but even his cunning and curious gaze could read nothing there of the feelings that really agitated the bosom of Felix Heron. It was not that the Earl of Whitcombe believed this tale, with all its illustrated comments from the lips of Le Jeune, but still he could not blind himself to the fact that there was the bracelet tha- he had given to Edith, and which she must either have parted with willingly or had stolen from her gems, which would be all at his disposal. I won it I recognised it as an ornament belonging to the Countess of Whitcombe ; and I bring it to your lordship \" \" Would it not have been as well,\" said the Earl, \" to take it to the Countess \u2014 since, according to your own account it has been in your possession since last night, and here is night again ?\" Felix Heron little imagined that Le Jeune had adopted this view of the subject and that he had had the interview we have already recorded with Edith on account of the bracelet. But Le Jeune made a specious reply. \" My duty was to you, my lord ; and it would have been, perhaps, scarcely seemly or pleasing to you if I had presumed to address her ladyship, the Countess, upon any snch subject\" \" Well, sir, you have told your tale ; and I pre sume have nothing more to add?\" \" Nothing, my lord.\" \" Then this night\u2014 this hour\u2014 this minute\u2014 you quit my service!\" \" Quit your lordship's service ?\" \" Yes. I am willing to believe that you did me a service ; but I'm quite certain that by this time it has been well repaid. There is the door, sir ; I would be alone.\" The latter supposition would have been the conclusion for him to have arrived at at once, under any other circumstances than those pre sent ; but he was painfully and peculiarly situ ated He had to look at everything he did not know thoroughly, through the medium of those things about which there could be no dispute. There was too much probability, therefore, that what Le Jeune said had some phases of truth in it for it to be wholly doubted. But Le Jeune reaped a very unexpected har vest from the seeds of discord he thought he was thus sowing. The Earl of Whitcombe spoke to him coldly and calmly. \" Since this bracelet, according to your state ment, passed from the hands of the Countess of Whitcombe into those of the disreputable person you describe, I would fain know the next step in its history ?\" \" The next step, roy lord ?\" \" Yes. How did it pass from that disreputable person's hands into yours?\" Le Jenne, with all his cunning, was unprepared for this question. His mind had been so intent upon persuading the Earl of Whitcombe that the Countess must have given this bracelet away to some favoured lover, that he had quite forgotten his share in the transaction might be questioned. But Le Jeune was a man of resources. The position was rather a difficult one ; but he made np his mind as to the best means of extricating himself from it at once. \" My lord,\" he said, \" I hoped you would not ask me that; but, since yon have\u2014 and since, whatever may be my other faults, truth has taken up its abode in this contrite heart,\u2014 I will confess that one of the causes that brought me so low, when I had the good fortune to do your lordship a service,; which recommended me to your favour able notice, was a love of play.\" \"Gambling?\" \" Just so, my lord ! I thought I had recovered from it, and cast away for ever the fascinating temptation. But alas, for human weakness ! 1 miscalculated my strength ; and passing last night the door of one of those mansions, the portals of which I have too often crossed, to my rnin, I en tered, thinking to be a spectator, and soon I was tempted to risk something on the fickle dice.\" \" Go on, sir.\" \" I played \u2014 I won ; and he with whom I played was the disreputable person I have mentioned to your lordship ; and when he had no longer cur rent gold of the realm to stake against me, he produced this bracelet, and, with a light langb, challenged me to play for it, saying, as he did so, that the fair lady who presented it to him could easily coin her husband's coronet into a few more \" My lord !\" \"Remonstrances are useless \u2014 I have said it The sight of you henceforth will be loathsome to me. Begone, sir !\" A savage look of ferocity passed over the coun tenance of Le Jeune. Nothing had been further from his thoughts than leaving the snug quarters of Whitcombe House, where in truth he had no thing to do but to enjoy himself and rob the un suspecting Earl to almost any extent he pleased ; but he saw no hope for it He was sentenced \u2014 he was caught by his own snare\u2014 had fallen into his own pit-fall. But at that moment it was not so much against the Earl of Whitcombe that Le Jeune was angry and enraged : it was Edith that awakened all the ferocious vindictiveness of his disposition. It was her total and contemptuous refusal to compromise the affair of the bracelet with him upon any terms which had led him into his pre sent dilemma. Bitter were the unuttered maledictions which swarmed to his lips upon her innocent head. But what further parley might have ensued between tha discharged secretary and his noble minded master, was cut short by the sudden rush of carriage wheels to the door of Whitcombe House, and an appeal at the knocker for admission which reverberated through the entire mansion. The Earl slightly started, and the colour deepened on his face. Was this Edith returning to him ? Did she come with a few words of explanation, which would topple down at once like a pack of cards all the circumstances which rcemed adverse to the innocence of ber fair and spotless heart? Felix Heron hoped that this was so. Le Jenne feared it The drawing-room door was thrown open. But no Edith appeared. A servant annonnced in a loud tone, \" His lord ship the Earl of Bridgewater.\" With a flush upon his face, the young Earl entered the room. He seemed about to say some thing hastily and impulsively, when his eyes fell upon Le Jeune, and he made a hasty action, which implied that he wonld be alone with Heron."], [102, "96 EDITH HERON. \"Gel\" said the Earl of Whitcombe, as he placed his hand in that of his friend Bridgewater ; \"Go, sir ; and it will be well that you never let me look upon your face again.\" \" Good !\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater in his impetuous way. \" I'm glad you are getting rid of that fellow, Whitcombe. I never liked his looks. If he's an honest man, nature is an abominable cheat to give him such a countenance.\" Le Jenne looked like a baffled snake. \" My Lord Bridgewater,\" he said as he neared the door,\u2014\" my Lord Bridgewater, if I live_ and yon live, I will make those words turn to bitter ness. You are young, indiscreet headstrong, and foolish. You pride yourself upon being one of those people whe speak their minds\u2014 scattering their thoughts about them like a flaming sword. But beware, sir, for you and I shall meet again ; and I will remind you, that although nature may have given me a countenance that yon dislike, she has likewise given me the capacity to remember an insult and to avenge it.\" Le Jeune almost yelled out the latter part of this speech, and was gone before the Earl of Bridge water could take two steps towards him. \" Heed him not Bridgewater \u2014 heed him not I\" said the Earl of Whitcombe. \" I am well rid of that man, and you can well afford to smile at his threats.\" \" The scoundrel I But let me not forget Whit combe. I came here in hot haste 1\" \" Can I serve yon in any way ?\" \" No, Whitcombe ; but hy the heaven above us, I think I can serve yon. I know not how it is, but enemies seem to rise up against you like mush rooms in a night There is danger in the very air.\" CHAPTER XXXIV. THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER WARNS FELIX HERON OP A GREAT DANGER, AND DAISY COMES TO THE RESCUE. The gush of feeling that had for the moment com pletely overwhelmed Felix Heron, passed away. By one of those great efforts whioh a strong man can make, he bade his heart be still. He removed his hands from before his face, and he was calm again. But how pale he looked ! How sad ! How wan I In those few brief moments years of the ordi nary havoc and wear and tear of existence had passed over poor Felix Heron. He looked no longer a young man when he again bent his gaze upon the face of his friend Bridgewater. \" Good heaven !\" said the young Earl. \" This must not be ! My dear Whitcombe, there is some terrible \u2014 some fatal mistake at the root of all this!\" \" Mistake, Bridgewater ? Oh, no, no I\" \" But I say, and will ever maintain it ii I die in my belief, without being able to prove to you my opinion !\" \" What opinion ?\" \"That Edith is innocent as one of heaven's angels, and loves you still, as she ever loved yon, with a holiness and purity and undivided thought and affection which time nor circumstance can affect\" This opinion of the Earl of Bridgewater was apparently in the mest direct contradiction to the facts as they presented themselves ; but yet how delightful it was to Feb'x Heron to hear it I What pleasant music it was to his ears to hear any one declare a belief that Edith was true to him \u2014 that she loved him still I \" I am proof \u2014 proof as steel 1\" \" Nay, but hear me \u2014 something has happened.\" \" Nothing more can happen \u2014 at least Bridge water, events may happen, and incidents may float around me, thick as moats in the sunbeams ; but my heart is seared against their influence.\" \" What mean you ?\" \"Edith!\" But could he really think so ? Would those dear thoughts stand the test of oalm reflection ? \"What of Edith? Is she not well ?\" Alas, no ! Where was Edith, if she loved him etill ? That was the fearful question. \" My dear Bridgewater,\" said Heron, \" speak to me no more. We are all in the hands of a higher power than dwells npon earth, and we must wait his good time to clear np all mysteries.\" \" By George !\" cried the young Earl, \" talking of powers on earth puts me in mind of what I came about !\" \" She is no longer here. Edith has left me \u2014 left me without a word\u2014 and I am alone!\" \" You dream, Whitcombe \u2014 you dream !\" \" It is a strange day-dream, then ; but let it not disturb you, Bridgewater. All that's bright must fade. Change is the order of the world, and that which has looked to ns brightest fairest, and most stable shall pass away, \" ' And leave not a rack behind 1' \" \" More calamity ?\" \" Danger, at all events, Whitcombe I\" Felix smiled faintly. It was like a gleam of misty sunshine npon some ice-bound stream. \" What oan affect me now ?\" he said. \" What can stir me even to action? Nay, I fanoy that I would gladly welcome any danger that brought with it a chance of extinction 1\" The Earl of Whitcombe\u2014 that noble-hearted, gallant Felix Heron \u2014 had preserved his compo sure up to this point and no one could possibly have guessed at the heart-anguish that beset him ; bnt as he uttered these words, he clasped his hands over his face, and a deep groan came from his labouring breast The Earl of Bridgewater was amazed. At any moment of the day or night if he had been asked to stake life and fortune against some thing that he would have thought more stable than the world itself, he would have named the fair faith and constancy of Edith to Felix Heron. But now, from an authority about which there could be no dispute, he heard that that faith was a sham \u2014 a delusion \u2014 a baseless something which had collapsed and been scattered to the winds. No wonder that the chivalrous young nobleman was struck dumb with amazement \" By Jove, this does !\" \"What is it?\" \" Hush ! Listen 1 A coach stops at yonr door ! Is it possible that I have allowed the time for escape to pass away?\" \" Escape, Bridgewater ? What can yon mean by escape?\" The young Earl placed his finger on his lips, as he said, in a whisper, \" Hush, hush, Whitcombe!

One glance was sufficient He turned to Felix Heron. \"A letter!

There are footsteps on the stairs.\" \"Hush! hush!\" \" Nay, I will not be taken like a rat in a trap, although it be a handsome one!\" cried Felix Heron, as he looked about him ;\u2014 and then, spring ing to the door, he turned the key in the lock. This closing of the door of that apartment m'gbt, be a temporary check to the advance of the foes of Fel''x Heron (we love to call him by this old, familiar name) ; but it could be no more. Armed with the auth.rity that brought him to that house, the messenger of the Privy Council would make but little difficulty about a closed door. \" Yes, Captain. But never mind me. The traps and nabs are down stairs, so come on.\" \" What do you mean, Tom ?\" \"Just that, Captain.\" \" Eut I thought you had gone to Epping.\" \" So I had, Captain.

Captain \u2014 come on!\" he cried. \" Hurrah !\u2014 hurrah !\" It wonld seem that these shouts of exultation must have reached the ears of the pursuivant with the Privy Council warrant below, for there was a con! used sound, and then a loud voice said, \" I summon all to tssist in the King's name !\" And now hardly had Felix Heron turned tha key in the lock, than the handle of the door was rattled by some one without The Earl of Bridgewater clasped Heron's hand in his, as he whispered anxiously, \" My dear friend, is there no present means of escape from this room and from this house?\" \" Yes ; I will try the window. It is but a leap from the balcony into the street, and when I am once there, he will be a bold man who can stay me.\" \" But there is another door.\" \" Yes, it leads to another dressing-room only.\" \" Good heavens!\" \" Nay, my time has not yet come, Bridgewater. Felix Heron will yet be heard of. Farewell!\" He^on went to one of the windows. There came an impatient tapping at the door of the room. The Earl of Bridgewater drew his sword. \"Fly, Heron \u2014 fly!\" he said. \"I would not counsel you to do so if the charges brought against you were fair ones, and to be met fairly and openly ; but I am convinced they are dictated by malice, and therefore I say fly while you can.\" \" Anil once more I say farewell,\" responded Heron ; \"and may my mind forget all its fancies, and memory pass away from me like a dream, if ever I forget yonr generosity and kindness \" The hands of the two young men, who from the first moment they had met had taken such an extraordinary liking for ea.h other, met for a mo ment ; and then, as Felix Heron stepped closer to the window he had partially opened, the Earl of Bridgewater took his post close to the door. The tapping on the panel had continued- It had rather puzzled the Earl. That tapping was certainly impatient hut it had at the same time to > quiet and subdued a charac ter about it to be ho;- tile. The Earl of Bridgewater thought he would ask a question. He removed the swinging piece of gilt look furniture that covered the key-hole at the same time that he removed the key, and through that small orifice he spoke. \" Who is there, and who are you?\" \" Goodness gracious ! it's me,\" replied a voice. \"But who?\" \" Tom.\" \" Tom ?

There is some one who speaks in a friendly tone, and oalls himself Tom.\" \" Then he is a friend,\" said Heron \" Do you not remember Tom Ripon, Bridgewater ?\""], [105, "EDITH HERON. 99 \" T hero seems no time to lose,\" said Heron. \" Not a moment\" replied the Earl of Bridge- OS AP TER XXXV. water. \" Come on ! \u2014 oh, do come on, Captain !\" spoke Tom Bipon, in imploring tones. \" C_me on, Captain ; I will show you the way.\" Heron pressed the hand of the young Earl. \" Once more, then, dear friend, farewell I We shall assuredly meet again.\" \" Yes, Whitcombe, and we will not part just yet, for I will see you clear of Whitcombe House.\" CAPTAIN HERON IS ONCE AGAIN WITH DAISY BENEATH THE SHADES OF OLD EPPING FOREST. \u2014 A STORM, AND ITS RESULTS. \"Hilloa! hilloa!\" cried a voice \"Who's that? What's that eh ? Hilloa !\" It was spme one in the stable yard just below where Felix Heron, Tom Bipon, and the Earl of Bridgewater were- \" Don't speak,\" whispered Heron. \" Stoop low,\" said Tom, in the same tones. They all three stooped low en the roof of the outhouse. \" Come on, then ; let us follow Tom.\" They were only just in time. The pursuivant, making sure of his prisoner, since he had possession of the door of the house, had thought it his best plan to seal up the deskii, drawers, and cabinets in the library first; but now that work being accomplished, ho com menced the ascent of the grand staircase. Felix Heron, preceded by Tom Bipon, and fol lowed by the Earl of Bridgewater, were on the landiug outside the drawing-room door just as the pursuivant commenced his upward progress- But he was too late. \"Hoy ! hoy ! What's there ?\" cried the voice again ; but as no response was made, the man, who was, in truth, no other than one of the Earl of Whiteombe'd own grooms, went grumbling and muttering to himself back into the stable. Tom Bipon's ears were sharp. He heard what Ihe groom said, although he growled out his words in a low, indistinct tone. \" Captain, that fellow has gone to get a lantern out of the stable, to look up here with.\" \" Then, Tom, we must not be here for him to see, when he comes back.\" Tom dashed onward \u2014 a door was opened, and they were all three on the secondary staircase of the mansion. Tbat staircase led right down to the kitchen, but it was no part of Tom Bipon's intention to lead Felix Heron there. \" All right, Captain ; here we are ! This little bit of a window leads to a hay-loft, just above this stable, where Daisy is kept\" \" Let me but once lay my hand upon her silken mane, and I shall feel myself a free mao.\" \" Come on, then, Captain ; here yon goes !\" Tom B'pon must have had some weapon \\r tool with him, by which he broke the fastening of that little window in the hay-loft for it was secured on the inner side. There was a sharp crackling sound, and then the fall of some pieces of glass on the sloping roof of the outhoose. But the little square window was open. Tom was through it in a moment Then Felix Heron followed. About half-way down they came to a long window which lit these stairs, and which window was cut as it were, into two portions by the stair case itself. There was no difficulty in op\u00b0nipg this window at the top; and then in the dim night-light with out, Felix Heron could see that there was jast be lo w the level of the staircase without a r\u00b0of oi some outbuilding. To tell the truth, his mind had been so mnch occupied since he had become a resident of Whit combe House, tbat he had had no leisure in which to make himself acquainted with its details. But Tom Bipon was quite an efficient guide. \" That's all safe, Captain,\" said Tom. \" All you have got to do is to leap out as lightly as you cm.\" Tom did not confine himself to a verbal de scription of what was to be done, but as he spoke, he gave a practical example of it by leaping at once out at the window. The odour of the sweet, fresh hay. which the place was full of, came more pleasantly upon the senses of Huron than had all the Court perfumes, in the midst of which he had lived so recently. That odour reminded him of the country, and of his life in old Epping Forest again. But those thoughts were accompanied by a terrible pang at his heart Edith !\u2014 Edith ! What of Edith ? Where was his dearly loved Edith, now ? The back ef Whitcombe House was very dark, so that it looked as if Tom had leaped into the night air merely. The rattle of some slates and tiles, however, which he displaced npon tbe sloping roof, where he alighted, dissipated that idea, and Felix Heron followed him quickly. But Heron did not leap Tom was a light weight and the tiles and slates that he displaced acted as a warning to Heron to descend with as much caution as possible, which he did, and was soon by tbe side of Tom Bipon, without making any disturbance in the process. The Earl of Bridgewater followed. Both Heron and his friend were young, lithe, active men, so that a little escapade of this kind presented no difficulties to them. Tho groan that Captain Heron uttered alarmed Tom, who called out \" Oh, Captain ! have you been and gone and hurt yourself?\" \" No, Tool \u2014 no, not as you mean. Never mind. I am hurt p.st all healing, but heed it not\" \"Ah, there you are! Thieves! \u2014 thieves!\" shouted the groom at this moment who bad sallied out into tbe stable yard with a lante n, the broad glare of which he sent full on to the figure of the jourg E>rl of Bridgewater, before he could get through the little square window ef the stable, to follow Heron. \"Thieves! \u2014 thieves! Tony! Tony! bring the old blunderbuss ! Thieves I \u2014 thieves I\" \"Confound your howling!\" said Bridgewater, as he made an tffort to get throngh the wi'dow, but his foot slipping ou the roof of the outhouse, in consequence of the sudden giving way of a tile, he rolled rijjht to the edge of it ; and had he not, with considerable skill and dexterity, raised himself half-way to his feet and leaped the re-"], [106, "100 EDITH HERON. the house. I will be there wi.h Daisy on the other Bide of the coach.\" \"That will do, Tom.\" Tom Bipon was gone the next instant into the stable. mainder of the distance, he might have had a serious fa)L As it was, he reached the stable-yard, close to the feet of the troublesome groom. \" Be quiet, idiot !\" said the Earl. But this mode of address by no means induced the gioom to be silent \"Thieves! \u2014 thieves! Here's one of 'em! Bring the blunderbuss, Tony, and settle this one of 'em!\" \" I care not,\" began the Earl of Bridgewater \u2014 for his feelings were excited, and then he had hut little sensation of any personal danger, \u2014 \" 1 care not what becomes of me, but while I can raise an arm in defence of my friend, 1 will do eo.\" \" Yes,\" said Heron, as he gave Eridgewater a significant look; \"yes. That friend well knowo that the chivalry and the courage of the gallant Earl of Bridgewater are only equalled hy bis loyalty to the Crown and his reverence for the laws\" The young Earl could not but gather from the tone of Heron, and the significant look which he gave him, that he was playing some part \u00bb Yes \u2014 yes,\" he replied ; \" who will doubt me ?\" \" Not I, my lord,\" said the pursuivant; \" and so all I have to report i_ that I found ihe Bight Honourable the Earl of Bridgewater here, full of loyalty to the Crown and reverence for the law. Aud now, gentlemen, I must do my duty, and you, my Lord Whitcombe, are my prisoner. \" Be it so, Mr. Pursuivant.\" \" 1 have a coach, my lord, at the front of your mansion, in St. James's Street ; and if it will please you to follow me, we'll seek it at once!\" \" As you please, sir.\" \" But, Whitcombe?\" said the Earl of Bridge water, in a voice of grief and apprehension. \" Hush !\" The Ea.l was agt in perforce silenced; and he felt, or tried to convince himself that he felt, quite conten'ed and satisfied that Heron knew what he was about and would ultimately escape. \" Here you are, Ben !\" cried another voice, which probably belonged to Tony. \" Shout him!\" \" Get out o' the way, Ben !\" \"Fools!\" cried Bridgewater; \"what are you about ? Nay, if you will be so ridiculous, you shall have jour own share of it.\" The Earl caught hold of the man with the lantern, and swung him round so as to make him a shield as against the contents of tbe blunderbuss. \"Don't shoot him, Tony\u2014 don't thoot him! You 11 hit me if you do! Hold tight! don't shout !\" \" What is the meaning of all this?\" cried Felix Heron, who suddenly alighted in the yard, to the surprise of Tony and Bep. Heron had heard that Bridgewater was in some danger ; and without stopping to calculate the extent of it, or to tell hitutelf that no real peril could last long for tbe youug Earl, inasmuch as a declaration of who he was would clear him in a moment, he had crept on to the roof of the next house again, aud leaped down to his side. \"Oh, my lord, is that you?\" said the groom. \" Well?\" \" Why, my lord, we have caught a thief !\" \" A dear friend of mine I\" Heron placed his hand on the arm of the young Earl \" Do your duty, sir,\" then added Felix Heron to the Pursuivant, \u2014 \" do jour duty, sir ; and, please heaven, I will endeavour to do mine!\" There was something rather equivocal, to the mind of the offi-lT from the Privy Council, iu these words of the 'Earl of Whitcombe; aud he put on a look of anxiety, as he said, \" My lord, you can well imagine that it is of very vital im portance to me that 1 should effect a capture that is entrusted to me to make.\" \" Oh ! of course \u2014 of course ! It is of vital im portance to the fowler that he should bring down his bir i ; and the bird who don't or won't see it is surely one of ill-disposition, and not at all alive to that charity which selfish people pretend begins at home- So lead on, sir ; I follow !\" \" Ou your honour, my lord?\" \" On my honour, what?\" \" Your lordship will follow me round to the frout of the house?\" Ben and Tony both looked unutterable things. \" Away with you,\" added Heron. \" Surely I may be permitted to vh_it my owu stables when and how I please.\" \"(ih, my lord!\" began Ben, the groom ; \"how ever was we to know \" \u2022' Enough ! enough ! Ah !\" There was a rush of feet ; and frem the side street into which the extensive stabling of Whit combe House opened, there arrived no other than the pursuivant, with one of his officers and some balf-dczen people whom he had pressed into his service in the King's name. \" My Lord Whitcombe, you are my prisoner!\" \" No \u2014 never !\" Felix Heron put his hand to his side but he bad uo sword. The Earl of Bridgewater darted forward and oried out loudly, \" 1 say no likewise\u2014 not while 1 live!\" \"Beware, my Lord Bridge water !\" said the pursuivant. \" I know you, my lord!\" \" You may know me, or know me not, and yet \" \" Oh, my lord, take care !\" interrupted the pur suivant ; \" it will do no good to yuur friend to get yourself included in the charge., aeaioet him ; and if not that, you know, as well as I do, that it is a serious offence to obstruct me, holding the warrant I do, in the discharge of my duty.\" Before the Earl of Bridgewater could make any reply to this certainly reasonable speech, or decide npon what to do, Felix Heron felt some one give him a twitch at the skirta of his coat. \" Captain, Captain .\" whispered Tom Bipon, \u2014 \" Captain, let them take you round to the front of \"Oq my honour, yes !\" \" Then I am satisfied.\" \" Aud so am I.\" The pursuivant said he was satisfied ; but it was quite evident that he was not, or he would never have cast the anxious glances he did behind him at the Earl of Whitcombe, ae they made their way round to the hall door of Whitcomfce House. The Earl of Bridgewater did not see at all why he should not walk by the side of his friend, and talk to him, too ; eo he took the arm of Heron, and spoke in a low vote., which could only reach his ears. \" You will escape ?\" \" Assuredly.\" \" Thank heaven !\" \" Amen ! Bridgewater, I have always had"], [107, "EDITH HERON. 101 < I \\ I much to thank heaven for; and never contradict, or treat with levity, the aspiration !

THE VILLANOUS LE JEl'NE INTERFERES, TO HIS OWN DHTKIMENT, WITH FuLIX HERON. \"Farewell!\" said Heron to the E.rl of Bridge water. \" Farewell, dear friend ; we shall soon meet again.\" \" And the sooner the better,\" replied the Earl, as Heron stepped into the coach. There was at that moment a sharp clatter of horses' feet in St. James's Street \" Then I will take good care to send you word where I am ; \u2014 for I shall look upon you as the one link that still binds me to a world with which otherwise I have done for ever !\" There was a world of melancholy in the tone with which Felix Heron uttered these words, and they sunk deep into the heart of the Earl of Bridgewater. But the distance to the front of Whitcombe House was but short, and was soon paased over. There stood the cncb. Then aloud voice called out, \"Take care that th\" felon Earl of Whitcombo does not escape you, Mr Pursuivant !\" \" Ah ! Who says that ?\" cried the officer. \" Hold !\u2014 hold ! Stop ! My lord !\u2014 my lord !\" Tom Bipon had swung the coach door open, and at a bound, Felix Heron epning right through the vehicle and out at the other side. A dark-looking object was on the other side of it ; and as Heron neared the vehicle he heard the voice of Tom Bipon speaking to the coachman. Tom was evidently making some excuses for being there; but it was with a pang of disappoint ment that Heron saw Tom standing np on the wheel of the coach, but no Daisy. What could Tom Bipon mean ? Hid he not promised to bring Daisy round to the coach ? And jet there he was, alone ! And time so precious. \" Ah, my friend !\" said Heron, as be clasped the hand of the Earl of Bridgewater ; \" I begin to think that I shall nit escape, af'er all !\" \" Good gracious ! Why not ?\" \"Hush!\u2014 hush!\" \" All right Captain.\" \" Daisy ? Where is Daisy ?\" \" With Ogle Here he comes !\" \" Take c ire !\" yelled the voice again, and this time the Earl of Whitcombe knew the tones to be those of Le Jtune. \" Take care, or the felon will escape !\" \"Help! \u2014 help! In the King's name, help!\" cried the bewildered pursuivant, as he made a rush to get round the coach, and ran violently against one of his own men. \" Daisy to the rescue !\" cried another voice. That was the voice of Ogle. \" Hoorah !\" shouted Tom Bipon. Captain Heron had, in another moment his band on the saddle of Daisy. \" My lord! \u2014 my lord !\" shouted the pursuivant \" you gave me your word of honour !\" \" Yes,\" replied Heron, \" I did, that 1 would come round here to the coach, and I have kept my word, for I have been on both sides of it, and in It\" The first turning to the right, and the second to the left,\" said Tom. \" Is that the way, Mr. Coach man?\" Tom was evidently pretending to ask his way of the coachman, to give him au excuse for mount ing on the wheel of the vehicle.\" \" Be off,\" said the coachman ; \" I can't he bothered with you. Be off, I say.\" \" Well, but I do want to know the way to Pimlico.\" As be spoke, he was in the saddle. \" Hoorah!\" cried Tom again. \" Be quiet Tom,\" said Ogle. \" Jump up behind me, and hold your tongue, do.\" \" All's right ! Hoorah ! Well, I won't again. Hoorah ! No. I won't any more.\" The pnrsuivant had got round the coach, and made a snatch at the bridle of Daisy. \"Hands off, Bir !\" said Heron ; \" my horse don't like it\" \" Be off, I say.\" \" But I'm waiting for a friend of mine of the name of Ogle, who will be here in half a minute on a bay horse of his own, and leading a dark bay mare of the name of Buttercup or Daisy.\" \" I am saved !\" whispered Heron to the Earl of Bridgwater. \"lam saved !\" \" You terrify and bewilder me,\" replied Bridge water. \" One moment you are all confidence, and the next you are all despair.\" A faint smile came across the handsome features of Felix Heron, for he had perfectly well under stood what Tom Bipon meant to convey to him. \"Now, my lord,\" said the officer, as he opened the coach door ; \" now, my lord, please to step in, and I will follow you.\" \" Yes,\" replied Heron. \" Yes ; that will do\" As Tom Bipon still stood npon the coach wheel, worrying the coachman about the nuarest way to Pimlico, he had managed to turn the handle of the coach door on that, the outer side. Felix Heron saw the long narrow line of light from one of the street lamps which shone through the crevice, and he perfectly understood what Tom Bipon meant that he should do on entering the coach. As hs spoke, he gave Daisy that slight pat on the neck which she understood so well as the signal to make one of those demi-vaults which there was no withstanding. The bridle was twitched out of the hands of the offic.r, and he was left prostrate in the road. But Le Jeune thought he would be excessively cunning, and adopt a surer aud safer method of endangering the escape of Felix Heron than attempting actually to attack him, which was a service of peril he did not exactly seem to fancy. He reckoned upon that nobility of soul which Heron possessed, which would prevent him from riding off aud leaving in danger those who had come to save him. Acting, therefore, upon that principle, he caught hold, not of the bridle of Daisy, as the more straightforward and incautious pursuivant had done, but that of Ogle's horse, on which now Tom Bipon had likewise scrambled. \" Hold !\" cried Le Jeune. \" Not so fast, my friend !\" \" Hands off !\" said Ogle."], [108, "102 EDITH HERON. \" Knock him over !\" said Tom. until his forehead almost touched the silken mane of his noble steed. Le Jenne drew a rather large, heavy pistol from bis pocket, and presented it directly at Ogle's head. \" Halt or you are a dead man !\" \" Oh, dear, no !\" said Ogle. Le Jeune, with all his cunning, was not pre pared for that rapidity of conception and move ment which the adventurous life he had led had taught Ogle. If he, Le Jeune, had had half a Becond to reflect in, or in which to guard himself against what happened, he could have avoided it. \" Thanks, Captain, thanks !\" cried Ogle. The fact was, that Ogle had more than once called out to Heron to be so good as to slacken Daisy's pace a little. It was not possible to keep up with the swift dashing gallop of Daisy ; especially as Ogle's horse, although it was a right good one, carried Tom Bipon as well as Ogle himself. \" Thanks, Captain, thanks ! It's no detriment to any horse I ever bestrode to be beaten by Daisy.\" \" What is it, Ogle ?\" asked Felix Heron in mournful tones, as he looked round. As it was, however, it looked like one and the same action for him to draw the heavy pistol from his pocket and present it at the head of Ogle, and then for Ogle to snatch it out of his hand and hit him so sharp a crack on the forehead with it, that he fell to the ground as though he had been shot. \" Well done, Ogle!\" cried Felix Heron. \" Hurrah, our side !\" shouted Tom. \" Why, Captain, you have been good enough to draw rein just to let us breathe a little, as I asked you.\" \" I did not hear you.\" There was so much pain and dejection in the manner of Heron, that Ogle could not but notice it \" Ah, Captain, you are ill, I fear,\" he said; \"but we will scon put you all to rights again in the old forest Being a lord don't agree with every body, especially those who have been used to the open air, I take it\" \"Alas! alas!\" All these sharp and sudden events had happened within a space of time certainly not exceeding one minute and a-half, so that there really was not time for the few half frightened spectators in St. James's Street to comprehend what it was all about, or to interfere. The pursuivant lay on his back in the road, and yelled out for help. \" Treason ! treason ! In the King's name, help ! oh, help ! In the King's name !\" But those cries rather added to the confusion of all who might, and could, perhaps, have helped him. \" Come, Captain, cheer up ! I don't know what has happened, but, at all events, we have got the better of the rascals.\" \" Where are we ?\" \" Why, close to old Whitechapel Church.\" \" Ah, yes ! I know now. And how came you in town. Ogle?\" \" Why, you see. Captain, I felt melancholy like last night, and couldn't sleep well. I thought I had a sort of an idea that things were not right, so I came to speak to Tom, and ask him how affairs were getting on in the town crib, you 6ee, Captain.\" \" Yes, yes ! You were right.\" \" Glad to hear you say that Captain. And how is Miss Edith? Lord bless me! I always do for get, and ought to call her Lady Edith, I suppose ?\" \"Ogle?\" \" Yes, Captain !\" \" Will you oblige me in one thing?\" \"In all things, and in anything, Captain.\" \" Never, then, mention to me again the name of \u2014 of \u2014 her name \u2014 her name 1\" The only persons who may be said to have known exactly what they were about at that mo ment and to be tolerably cool and calm, were Felix Heron himself and his attached follower, Ogle. It was wonderful what a soothing effect upon the system of Heron this little fracas had. It was so like some episode in his former life, that it at once calmed down all nervous irritation, and made him feel quite himself again. \" Forward !\" he cried. \" Off, and away ! Ho, my gallant Daisy, I am with you, and am free again !\" There was a rash of horses' feet \u2014 the loose stones in the road flew up like hail\u2014 and then past Pall Mall, past Charing Cross, and up the Strand, at a pace that set all pursuit at defiance, went Felix Heron and Ogle. It was with a strange sensation of absolute re lief that Heron felt, as at each bound of the gal lant Daisy he left behind him that earldom that had cost him such infinite pains to attain, and which now he cast off from him, so to speak, in the midst of a struggle and a fight Who could have imagined that a few brief months would see the great Earl of Whitcombe a fugitive through London on the noble steed that had sa often carried him beneath the green boughs of old Epping Forest, and on so many exploits and adventures by the road and the heath ? But so it was ; aud the change to the feelings of Heron was like escaping from a prison into the free, open air of heaven. H he had only had his Edith by his side ! \"Oh, God !\" he exclaimed, as this thought passed through his brain. \" My Edith ! my Edith ! Where, oh, where are you now, and why are we not together ?\" The fugitives were nearly through the Oity when Heron uttered these words, and drawing rein, he half stopped Daisy, and clasping his hands over his brow, he drooped low upon the saddle, \" The name of Edith, Captain?\" \" The name of Edith ! Never again ! Never morel\" Ogle took off his hat and spoke with great reve rence \u2014 \" Amen, and the Lord be good to us all ! And so she is a saint in heaven ! Poor, sweet dear young creature !\" \" Hold ! Peace !\" cried Felix Heron, in excited tones. \" Ogle, I command you, silence ! Do you wish to drive me mad ?\" \" Heaven forbid, Captain I\" \" Then peace ! She \u2014 she is not dead !\" \" Not dead ?\" \"No\u2014 no! Once\u2014 once for all! You eau tell it to the band, too. Ob, yes ; it had better, far better, be told at once. It is but ono wrench to the heart, and then the pang is over. Ogle, I will tell you, and then you will know, you will com prehend, why that name is never to be mentioned more !\" \" Y-e-s, Captain !\" replied gie, with an air of the most perfect bewilderment \" Edith has\u2014 has \" \"Yes, Captain?\" \" Edith\u2014 has\u2014 has left me !\""], [109, "103 EDITH HERON. \" No, by \" \" Hush ! How dare you ?\" \" Captain, your lightest word has always been to me a law. and you know it well ! When death and danger have been hovering about us, you know well I would always have right gladly put myself in the way of a bullet, than it should go wandering through the air on the chance of hitting you. You know that I wouldn't say a word to hurt you for all the world ; but if this was the last moment I had to live \u2014 if the penalty of saying what I now say was present death \u2014 and you may kill me if you like\u2014 (don't say anything about it Tom, if the Captain does blow my brains out)\u2014 but you will never make me think or believe that Edith is not true as steel, pure as a rainbow, and as good as she is beautiful !\" air of the open country ! \u2014 let me hear the rustle of the night wind among the trees ! Forward ! forward !\" Felix Heron waited for no reply to these words, but, giving the rein to Daisy, he dashed on again. Both Ogle and Tom Bipon, however, were well pleased to see that he took the direct road to Ep ping Forest, for there they knew that, whatever happened, be would be in safety. And probably, in the midst of his mind's pre occupation, Captain Heron recollected that it would not be possible for Ogle's horse to ktep np with Daisy ; therefore, although the pace he went at was a good one, it was by no means that terribl . rush which Daisy was capable of. Under these circumstances, Tom Bipon and Ogle were able to converse a little, and the latter was exceedingly anxious to aicertain if Tom could tell him what it was that had happened to pro duce such a revolution at Whitcombe House. \" And gooder too !\" said Tom Bipon. Felix Heron had bent down his head again upon tho neck of Daisy. Tears came to his eyes. Deep sighs rose up from his saddened heart And yet the first gleam of real happiness he had felt since that terrible shadow had passed over his domestic happiress was now at his heart, as the honest earnest words of Ogle found an echo \" I don't know a bit,\" said Tom, in answer to Ogle's questions \u2014 \" but there's been something wrong ; and whatever it was, I can't help think ing one-half of it was owing to that vagabond fellow yon knocked down in St James's Street\" \" What ! the fellow who tried to stop our horsa?\" in its inmost recesses. And there 6at Ogle on his horse, with his hat still in his hand, as he had taken it off when he was under the i\u00e6prossicn that poor Edith was no more. \"That's him, Ogle.\" \" Well, then, it's a good job I did knock him down. But who, in the name of all that's ugly, is he ; for, beyond seeing, by the slight glance I had at him, that he was an ill-looking rascal, I don't think I ever had \u2014 I was going to say \u2014 the plea sure of seeing him before?\" \" The pleasure, Ogle ? What do you mean by that?\" Ogle looked noble at that moment. Little did Edith think that she had snch a faithful defender by the side of Felix \u2014 one who in good report or in evil report would not allow himself to think of her but as she really was and had ever been. \" Well, Tom, it was a pleasure in one sense, for I did not see him more than two seconds of time, aud during half of that period he lay sprawling on his back on the stones, with a crack on his head that I trust and hope will put a stop to his little career, whatever it is, for some time.\" \" Well, I hope so too,\" replied Tom ; \" but all I know of him is that the Captain\u2014 for I don't in tend to call our Captain an earl any more, \u2014 the Captain, there, brought him home one day, and ever since then everything's gone wrong; and as for our poor Edith, she didn't, look half so happy as when she was in Epping Forest along with all of us, only a little while ago.\" \" It is very strange.\" \" It is, Ogle, and I don't know what to make of it\" Tom Bipon said not another word. The subject under discussion between Ogle and Captain Heron was far too serious an one tor him to meddle with ; and with a delicacy of sentiment that could hardly have been expected from him, Tom felt that silence best became him under the circumstances. There was rather a flush upon the face of Ogle ; for, after what Captain Heron had said, he fully expected some burst of passion that might pos sibly endanger his safety. But such was not the case. Bold words, like bold actions, generally bring with them their own immunity. Moreover, there was a something about what had been said by Ogle which could not fail to find, to a certain extent, an answering echo in the heart of Heron. Was it for him to blame the man who chose to think Edith innocent despite all the circumstances surrounding the case which seemed to proclaim her guilty ? And so Ogle was rather surprised at the calm ness \u2014 indeed, we might almost call it meekness \u2014 with which Captain Heron replied to him. \" I have heard you, Ogle, and I cannot respect you less \u2014 nay, perhaps I respect you more than I have ever done for these words which you have, so to speak, flung at my head with honest indig nation. But be content now : you have said to me that which I would hear from no other living person ; and so we will say no more on this terrible theme, but wait until it is the good pleasure of a higher power than is to be found in humanity to chase away the clouds that now obscure the fair name of one who But I will say no more\u2014 I will say no more I Forward ! \u2014 forward ! The sight of houses and of streets is hateful to me ! Let me breathe the pure, fresh \" Nor I, Tom ; but it'll all come right and in my mind it's all owing to coming and living in a house in a street. The Captain, you see, has been in a constant worry for ever so long, about being an earl, and that's where all the row between him and Warringdale has been ; but you recollect him, Tom, well, when he was with us in Epping Forest?\" \" Of course I do, Ogle.\" \" Does he look now what he looked then ?\" \" I should think not. He's white and sad, and looks as fall of care as possible ; but he'll soon pick up, and you and I, Ogle, perhaps, can set our wits to work and ferret out what's amiss about Edith; and then, if we should fee so fortunate as to find it out and put everything right again, we'd tell the Captain that, al ways provided that he wouldn't be an earl any more, but would keep to his proper line of business on the road, every thing should be put right, and never go wrong any more, nohow.\" At this juncture, Captain Heron drew rein"], [110, "EDITH HERON. 104 abruptly, and, turning to Ogle, he cried, with something of his old spirit \" How many men have we in the forest Ogle ?\" \" All the lot, Captain.\" \" Ah ! they played me false in high quarters- I was promised faithfully a free and unconditional pardon for all my followers ; but with one cavil and another, I could see that it was never intended to be a perfect measure.\" \" Of course not, Captain ; it wasn't likely. But only look at Daisy \u2014 she seems half beside her self.\" It was quite evident that Daisy fully recognised the fact that she was rapidly approaching her old quarters in Epping Forest \u2014 for they were, indeed, now upon the very confines of the wood. The noble creature, with many curvettings and short, onward rushes, testified her approbation of the change from a close stable in London to the free, open air of the forest And even Heron himself seemed to leave some of his care behind him, although his mind was perplexed in the extreme ; and he could by no means account for some of the conduct of Edith, because he wanted, as yet, the slightest clue to her whole course of proceeding. A very few words, if any one had had the power to utter them to him, would have been suffi cient at once to have dispelled all the darkness that shrouded his mind on that all-absorbing subjects. of Epping, a leader of that band of lawless men. who had so often followed him upon desperate expeditions, and who, no doubt were right willing to do so again. What had they to regret, but his defection and departure from among them ? What had they gained by those proceedings iu London and at the Court of St James's, which had made their bold leader a peer, but danger aud difficulty ? And what had be gained? Alas 1 What indeed ? A heart-bitterness which no chances of fortune. could possibly have inflicted upon him, while pur suing lhat adventurous life beneath the green wood tree. The signal was replied to instantly. Then a light flashed in the forest, and swiff, as some falling acorn or chesnut from among the branches of one of the old gigautic trees around, there alighted a man upon that green award. \" To-whoo! to-whoo!\" hecried again, making tbe glade echo to the owl's cry. \" Who comes with the three owls all in one nest ?\" \" The Captain !\" shouted Tom Bipon. \" Yes,\" added Heron, as he took off his hat and let the lantern the scout had with him send a bright ray full upon his face; \" yes, I am Felix Heron, and my home is henceforward with those who have been my ancient companions.\" The member of the hand who was on duty as a scout raised a shout of gratification ; and then, placing his hands in a peculiar manner to hi* mouth, he brought forth another of the forest airs. but there was no one to utter those words, but Edith herself, and she had committed the fatal mis take of not determining to utter them until it was \u25a0jm late. That cry would be well understood by tbe band it was an imitation of the cawieg of a rook, and was the rallying cry which would inevitably bring them all to one spot \u2014 and that too, the spot from. whence the cry proceeded. Captain Heron knew it well. He himself had invented all those calls for dif ferent purposes in Epping Forest. They were all imitations of the cry of Bums bird or beast which might be expected to have a home in the wood, and they were all as well understood by his band as the bogle calls of a light infantry re giment to the soldiery, or the bray of a trumptt to a dragoon. There was a flush upon the face of Heron as he sat there upon Daisy, with the light of the single lantern shining upon him, and Tom B'pju on one side of him ; for he, Tom, had dismounted, and Ogle on the other, while the scou; stood a few paces in advance. A brisk wind had been careering among tho tree-tops, making lhat pleasant hushing souud which is only to be heard in those solitudes of nature, far removed from \"Halt Captain!\" cried Ogle: \"we are getting into one of the forest glades at a good rate, and as yet we give no signal.\" \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" and it's as dark as pitch here, so that the scouts in the trees won't be able to see w ho we are.\" \" Announce us then, Ogle,\" said Heron, as he reined in Daisy. Another moment and the forest echoed to the cry of the owl, thrice repeated, which, under ordi nary circumstances, would have been sufficient to let the band know that it was Captain Heron him self who revisited the deep and shadowy glades of the old forest But the idea of his return could not very readily enter into the imaginations of any of his band. The signal was replied to at once, but the scouts who held watch and ward in that forest glade were abont as much surprised at the owl's cry being repeated three times, as some ship's com pany might have been had a boat approached them with an admiral's flag flying, without their being aware that there was an officer of such rank within many a mile of their station. But the sur prise was a joyful one. \" The b.isy, anxious haunts of man\" The night, too, was a dark one. But that darkness was soon to give way to a silvery and beautiful brilliance. Over the tops of a group of lordly elm trees, there appeared a growing brightness The moon, which, so far as her actual risingwas concerned, had long since been above the horizon, had, however, been hidden behind a heavy bank of clouds, which reached nearly to the \" crown of heaven's arch.\" CHAPTEE XXXVII. CAPTAIN HERON MARES A PROPOSITION TO HIS BAND, AND BE IS BOUND BY A PROiHSE IN RETURN How strangely that familiar sound thrilled through the heart of Felix Heron 1 That hoot of the bird of night, which he had never expected again to hear, under the ciicum stancei which had once brought it to his notice so frequently. Now, however, the fair luminary had got to tbe verge of that bauk of clouds. The edges of them took a silvery hae. And there he was again beneath the old trees"], [111, "EDITH IIEP.ON. 105 Soon, then, tbat silvery hue increased until it was almost too bright to look upon. And theu, with a majestic motion, the moon sailed forth in all its splendour and beauty. in a moment the forest glade was lit up as if for some fairly spectacle. The abrupt shadows of the trees speckled the to talk about the moon of London, aud such lik* big places with tops of hou.es ; but nobody wiil ever make me believed its the same that we see in old Epping Forest\" Ogle laughed. \" So, Tom, you think there are two moons ?\" \" In course !\" grass with many an intricate network of branches \"One for the town, and the other for the and leaves, but one broad gleam of the fair moon- country ?\" light fell fully and distinctly npon Captain Felix \" Well, don't every stupid know that, Mr. Ogle.

That horse, and that rider, in those moon beans looked something rn^ra than mort.l. \" A fair night, after all, Captain,\" said Ogle. \"Most fair I\" \" Wail,\" said Tom Kipon, \" it's all very well Those cries were very eccentric. They had always, as we have already stated, No. Ii\u2014 Edith."], [112, "106 EDITH HERON. been in the habit of making the cries of birds and beasts their watchwords, and Heron himself had invented many of those signals; but since his departure from among them, they had invented many more. The members of the baud fell back a little to allow Ogle to approach closely to Heron. \" You will speak to the men, Ogle, and tell them that on no pretenoe is the name of \u2014 of \u2014 one who \u2014of\u2014 Edith Well, I can speak it \" \" I comprehend you, Captain.\" \" I am sure you do.\" \" You ride aside, Captain, for a moment, under the shadows of the old trees, and I will settle all that.\" They felt that their situation in his absence had been one of extreme peril Aud now, with all the various cries of the owl, the rook, the dove, dog, cat, foal, goat, &c , which they had imparted into their vocabulary of signals, they welcomed their leader. \" Why,\" said Heron, \" this is a complete menagerie!\" But those cries only lasted until the band had gathered in a throng around Heron. Then they forgot all else, but that they were men over whose fortunes a kind of cloud had passed, by the absence of the Captain, who ever conducted them to good fortune. They raised one loud prolonged \" Hurrah !\" which awakened every echo of the forest. The slumbering hare started affrighted from its lec.fy couch. The squirrel from the mossy hollows of the old tree sprung up in terror, and uttered its short, sharp squeal. Many a bird shook off the sleep of the dim night, and strove in vain to beat the moonlit air, with terrified wing. Then Captain Heron held up one hand by way of caution, and the sounds died away. Daisy looked proudly conscious that she was in the midst of a daring circle; and no young beauty, the observed and admired of all observers, could have arched her neck, and looked more conscious and pleased than she did. \" Welcome, Captain '.\"\u2022 \" Hurrah for the Captain !\" \" Bravo, Daisy, lass !\" \" Now for the road, and the heath, and a merry life again !\" Such were some cf the expressions of satisfaction with which Heron and his gallant Daisy were welcomed. Heron did so. Ogle held a very brief conversation with the band, during which he told them that something had happened, with which neither he nor they had anything in the world to do; but that, as a conse quence of that something, whatever it was, they were to ba careful none of them to utter the name of Edith in the hearing of Felix Heron. They promised. \"Captain!\" c tiled out Ogle; \"will it please vou to ride forward and speak to the band?\" \"I will.\" Heron gave Daisy one of those slight impulses which he had taught her to understand so well, and she made but one leap to the centre of the glade. Then Heron spoke in a firmer voice than before. \" Comrades, I come among you once again as jour leader.\" A movement of intense satisfaction went among the band. \" As your leader, even as I was in old times, but not here beneath the old trees of Epping.\" \" With you, Captain, anywhere \" \"Anywhere! Anywhere! Anywhere!\" repeated every voice. \" Of that I feel convinced,\" added Heron ; \" but the reason simply is, that I shall be sought for on account of false and most malignant charges brought against me ; and, in all probability, it is here that my personal foes would expect to find me ; therefore, I cannot allow the general safety to be compromised.\" \" Captain, we will fight with and for you.\" \" I know it\u2014 I know it !\" Then he spoke. \" Comrades, and dear friends all, I twice tried the town. I have tried to fiud happiness in the haunts of men.\" \" To the death for the Captain ! To the death!\" All the bind repeated these words, and they had all the character of an oath. \" But you could not find it Captain,\" cried one. There was a solemnity about the scene in that woody spot, as those men, with the cold, but beautiful moonbeams upon them, uttered those words of unlimited confidence in their gallant leader. \" I could not. I might have been satisfied if I had found even contentment \u2014 peace ; but those were denied me.\" \" Bravo !\" cried a voice. \" Be it so,\" added Heron. \" But what I pro pose is, that we leave Epping \u2014 at all events, for a time \" Heron sighed. He could not but feel that those men looked upon the wreck of all his hopes, and all his happi ness, as so much gain to them ; and the reflection forced itself upon him that eo goes the world : one man's despair is another's satisfaction \u2014 one man's absolute ruin the foundation of another's fortune. \" Yes, Captain. It's an order, and we obey it.\" u I have special reasons for wishing that our next place of rendezvous and of action should be Blackheath.\" Heron was thinking of how he had encountered the villain Warringdale there. \" It will be my business, comrades, to find you a place of shelter in that locality. On Shooters' Hill there is an old building \u2014 old, but not ancient \u2014 in imitation of a castle of the middle ages. It belongs to me.\" \" To you, Captain ?\" \" Yes. Let them do what they will \u2014 say what they will, I am still the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \"Bravo!\" Yet he could not complain, and he did not But he had one great anxiety. The name of Edith, he expected, might at any moment be pronounced by heedless lips. He trembled as he thought that, probably in a few moments, he would have to submit to the heart-torture of having some questioning concern ing her. Therefore it was that he turned to his faithful follower, Ogle. \" That castle, then, on Shooters' Hill, forms a part of the property of the earldom ; and there fore I feel that I have a right to welcome my friends to it\" \"Ogle! Ogle!\" \" Here, Captain !\" \" One word with you.'"], [113, "107 EDITH HERON, I them are some persons who are either military men in plain clothes, or private persons who feel some personal interest in the expedition, what ever it is.\" \" Hurrah!\" \" And now, since you have all received me with go kind and so warm a welcome, it is right that I thonld put you in mind of one of our ancient agreements.\" \" What is that Captain ?\" whispered Ogle. \"What Ogle?\" \" Listen !\" \"Ogle!\" \" Here, Cantain !\" \"Bide round to the different outlets of the forest, and see what is there to be seen. If the route by the old sycamore tree, which was struck by the lightning last autumn, is open, let each man get ready to leave the wood by it.\" Another scout came in before Ogle could turn his horse's head to obey Heron. \" Captain, the wood is surronuded. Sentinels on horseback, two together at each post, are placed at every opening. \" So ! so ! \" said Heron calmly ; \" it seems that we shall not be dull.\" Heron listened intently, but he could hear nothing but the sighing of the wind among the tree-tops. \" What did you think you heard, Ogle ?\" \" The measured tramp of horses' feet\" \" Let a scout go out into the bridle road that leads through the forest\" said Heron, \" and let him pursue it right out into the open country.\" \" Number four!\" cried Ogle. \" Here !\" \" Go on the Captain's order.\" Number four, who looked upon Ogle as the sort of lieutenant of Heron, darted off on the instant \" I suppose, Captain,\" whispered Ogle, \" I had better stay by you.\" \"Yes! yes!\" After a few moments' thought then Heron looked about him, saying, \" Where is Tom Bipon ?\" \" Here I am, Captain. You haven't need to say twice, where is Tom Eipon ?\" \"Tom, you are as agile as a monkey, and not a great deal bigger than one.\" \" Thanks for particular small favours, Captain.\" \" So, Tom, you can go and spy out who tbe enemy are, and perhaps find out what they want\" \" In course I can.\" \" But be careful of yourself, Tom, and don't run any unnecessary risks, for remember I can't afford to lose you.\" \" All right Captain I When a man knows his own value, ho looks after himself pretty sharp.\" Tom Ripon darted away among the bushes, but he did not go direct to the outskirts of the wood, since he had an idea of his own which made it necessary tbat he should seek the hiding-places among the old ruins, for the purpose of finding means to carry out. There Tom encountered Mrs. Ogle. With all her eccentricities, Mrs. Ogle had a kind heart and she was very much attached to Tom, although he played her many a mischievous trick, and they often appeared to be at war with each other. \"Mother Ogle! Mother Ogle!\" said Tom, as he made his way through the mass of bushes, which looked impracticable, bnt which, in reality, had a narrow path among them which was known to the initiated. \" Oh, goodness gracious ! Who is that? \" Tom's ghost !\" \" What ? Oh, you little ruffian, how dare you say so? I was in good hopes I had seen the last of you. Bless you, Tom ! and how are you, my dear, you little wretch ?\" > \"All right but don't smother a fellow; dont, now. I want a basket\" \"A what?\" CHAPTER XXXVIII. FELIX HERON IS BELEAGUERED IN THE FOREST, AND TOM RIPON IS TAKEN PRISONER. Captain Heron did not anticipate any imme diate danger. There, however, he was wrong. His enemies took too personal an interest in his capture to leave him long at peace. That the scout however, who was sent to re connoitre would do his duty properly, Heron well knew, and he turned again to his band to conclude what be had bee n saying. \" It was one of onr ancient understandings, and indeed, positive agreements,\" he said, \" that the band should have the power to call npon me at any time to give my wbole attention to the carry ing out of not less than six adventures on the road or the heath.\" \" It was ! it was !\" \" But we don't want, Captain,\" put in Ogle, \" to bind you in any such way.\" \"No, no!\" This \" No, no I\" had a peculiar tone about it from some of the band ; so much so, indeed, that Heron felt certain many of them would be glad to see him come strictly under the terms of the agree ment. And it was but natural that they should do eo. \" Of my own free will, then,\" he said, \" I under take from this time six adventures, to which I promise to pay aU and exclusive attention.\" The suppressed murmur of satisfaction with which this announcement was received, was quite sufficient to let Heron see how welcome it was. \" Then that is settled,\" he said. \" Bravo ! bravo, Captain !\" At this moment the scout returned. Without the least hurry or confusion in his tones or manner, he made his way up to Heron, and stood waiting to be questioned. It was quite a kind of military organization that Heron kept up in his band. \" A force of twenty-two mounted men are on the outskirts of the wood.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes, Captain. They have halted, and are in consultation.\" \u00bb Who and what are they ?\" \" prfncipaUy officers of the poUce ; but among u ____ basket\" \"What can you want with a basket you odious little wietch ? Blessyou,I am eo glad to see youl' \"Don't now\u2014 don't go on mangling a fellows hair in that way, don't I don't like kissing. Get away.\" _ \" Oh, you little adder !\" \"WeU, you can call me what you Hke; but I wan't a basket and a Uttle tea and sugar secured np in bits of paper in it ; and if you have got a flannel petticoat \" \"A what?\""], [114, "108 EDITn HERON. invitation to supper, and he found himself tlone in the streets of London. With a grim smile Wild leant against a post, and reflected upon what he had better do next Visions of great success in regard to the peerage of Whitcombe floated across his imagination. But he felt one thing in the midbt of all those visions, and that was that they would never be successfully reatized while either of theso persona lived. \" I said a flannel petticoat didn't I ? I want to tarTy it from my missus, tbe landlady of the ' Bull and Bush,' to old Dame Mobberly, who lives in the village, ovtr on the other side of the wood. And eagh! eugh! oh! oh! hnbbaboo ! boo ! boo! I have lost my way in the wood, and I only thought I'd go into it, and try and find some nuts. Boo I boo!\" Tom cried and howled so naturally, that that, combined with the extraordinary things he wanted, and the as extraordinary statements he made about the landlady of the \" Bull and Bush,\" and a Dame Mobberly, inducad a suspicion in the mind of Mrs. Ogle that he must have gone stark mad. \" Oh, this is dreadful I\" \"What is?\" \" An insane infant like you, Tom.\" \"Come, come! Don't delay a fellow. The Captain has come back to the wood, and we are all going on again as we used to was. But there's some folks on the out6ide of the forest, and the Captain wants me to go and find out who they are, and thai's the ways I think of doing it.\" \"Oh, 1 think Isee!\" \" Of coi\u00bb.-se you does ! Now do be quick !\" Mrs. Ogle soon provided Tom with the articles he required ; and with a basket on his arm, and his hat pushed far to the back of his head\u2014 it is astonishing what a 6tnpid look that will give any one\u2014 he made his way in as direct a Una as he could to the outskirts of the wood. While Tom had been thus engaged, Captain Heron had taken good care to withdraw his men under cover. FeUx Heron. Lord Warringdale. The Earl of Bridgewater. Those were the three lives that Jonathan Wild felt would matt-rally stand in hit. way. But they were only lives ! Such obstacles were far from being those which Wild was in the habit of thinking iusurmountable. Still considering, then, what precise conrse he should pursue, he left the post against which he had been leaning, and made his way towards^ St. James's Street without being exactly conscious that he was taking that direction. Evil fortune would seem to have conspired against the peace and happiness of Felix Heron, in so far that it brought his enemies together at most inopportune moments for his welfare. Jonathan Wild had happened to reach St James's Street, and to come within sight of Whit combe House at the same moment that the Earl of Bridgewater, with such hurry in his footsteps, and such evident excitement in his manne-, reached that mansion for the purpose of warning Felix Heron of the danger that awaited him. That danger, it will be remembered, consisted in the warrant which had been granted for his appre hension by the Privy Council. The moonbeams fell much too strongly and vividly upon that forest glade for it to be a safe plnce in which to await the return of Tom Bipon, with such intelligence as he could bring. Crouching down, therefore, behind the bushes and the tall undergrowth of the forest Heron and his band waited the course of events- Daisy was still by the side of her master, for he had dismounted, and was quietly patting the sleek arched neck of the noble creature who had carried him through so many dangers. Jonathan Wild was by far too close an observer of men and manners not to see that there was something very unusual about the aspect of the Earl of Bridgewater on this occasion. The free and Uberated thief-taker took np his station in the doorway opposite. That very doorway which led to the old lodg ings of Lord Warringdale. There he kept good watch upon Whitcombe House; and, although it could not be said that WUd expected to gain much by such a surveillance over the mere residence of Felix Heron, yet a kind of instinct which he could not define, kept him there with his eyes fixed upon the mansion. That instinct soon deepened into interest. It was not long before he saw the door open, in that peculiar manner in which a door is opened \u2014 for these actions have an expression of their own \u2014 to allow of the exit of some one who was not again, with the good will of the inhabitants of the place, to cross the threshold. It was the villain Le Jeune who came forth. \" You, at least, my Daisy,\" he said, in a low, mournful tone, whioh no one could hear \u2014 \" you, at least, my Daisy, are always true \u2014 always faith ful \u2014 and love me with aU the heart that nature has bestowed upon you.\" It was with a deep-felt pang that Felix Heron uttered these words, for they sprung ont of the devotion of heart which he felt on Edith's account. But we must, for a brief space, leave Heron and his noble steed in the deep shadow of the underwood of Epping Forest, while we repair to Lrndon to account to our readers for the quick appearance of 6uch a troop of mounted men upon the confines of the old forest It will be recollected that Jonathan Wild had bad a most triumphant interview with the Secre tary of State. He had purchased his freedom from the apparent ruin that had encompassed him, and he felt cer that a new career was before him. That he was a free man was something to begin wi'h , \u25a0 . The Ught of the nearest lamp shone upon his face. It was a map of evil passions. \" Ha ! ha !\" said Wild to himself ; \" that is just the sort of man for me.\" It needed not that he should see Le Jenne turn round upon reaching the pavement, and shake his clenched fist at the house. What a wonderful advantage that would give him in bis little affair in connexion with the Whitcombe peerage, and his solicitor, Mr. Boom. As for the officers who had arrested him at his own house in Newgate Street they were so morti hed at the turn affairs had taken, that they were imiy too glad to get ont of Wild's company. On one excuse and another they avoided his It needed not that he should see him stamp with hie feet and that he should feel certain that he was utteriog imprecations. Jonathan WUd had seen quite enough in the expression of that man's face to assure himself that in him he beheld some bitter enemy of tne. Earl of Whitcombe. And Jonathan knew the man, too."], [115, "EDITH HERON. 109 But he was puzzled for a few seconds to know where he had seen him last, and under what particular circumstances he had known him. It was a peculiarity of Wild that he never forgot anybody , but, amid the multitude of persons he so remembered, it might and would occasionally happen that he would not be able to identify them tiy a name, or expressly by the ciicamstances tinder which he had seen them. CHAPTEB XXXIX. JONATHAN WILD OBTAINS SOME CREDIT, A\"D HOPES TO REPLENISH HIS PURSE AT THE SAMS TIME. \" So \u2014 so !\" said Wild to himself, as he stooped low down at the back of the coach, so that he could not be seen, but at the same time so that nothing could escape his observation. \" So \u2014 so I It seems then that the game of Felix Heron is up for the present, and that he has already made enemies enough at Court to bring ruin upon his h.ad.\" Wild was pleased at this. \" Well,\" he added, \" who knows but this may save me some trouble ; and yet \u2014 yet Oh, dear, no \u2014 that won't do at all !\" It was so in the case of Le Jeune. But only for a few seconds. \" Ah I\" exclaimed Wild suddenly, \" I know the fellow now. Tbe late Bishop of Worcester's secretary. I can have him whenever I like.\" Le Jenne disappeared round a corner, but Wild soon saw him appear again, peeping and prying \u25a0about in the manner of a man who expects some thing to happen of which he wishes to be a spec tator. What it was that would not do at al', It might puzzle the reader to guess ; but that Jonathan continued his little sotilo \\uy. \"No ; it won't do for anybody to nab au Earl bat myself. No clumsy fellow of a privy council offi::er, or pursuivant, as they call him, must do that There are two things to be got by suoh a capture \u2014 credit and profit!\" Wild was right There would soon be a goodly sum upon the head of the Earl of Whitcombe, if by any means he should escape the officers sant to capture him. \" This is an affair,\" added Wild, still communing with himself at the back of the coach, \u2014 \" this is an affair that will just suit me. 1 shall gain credit with the authorities, and they will begin to think again, as they thought some time ago, that there is no one like me.\" This was quite inducement enough for WUd himself to remain. And then came the coach with the pursuivant, und the officers who were to execute the Privy Council warrant. Then Jonathan Wild knew that there was some thing amiss, and that he had not waited there for nothing All was not secure and happy in that household of the new Earl of Whitcombe; and, if he had but patience to wait for, probably, only a few minutes longer, he might fee that one of the persons who stood between him aud his objects would be no longer able to interfere with them. To the practical eyes of Wild, the errand of the tnen in the coach was quite obvious. Au arrest was in progress, and that was a thing that in terested him, as a matter of course. He was a free man. An officer of the Crown again ! Should he go over the way and make himself useful, in aiding and assisting in the arrest that was about te take place ? This was a question Wild put to himself. But be quickly answered it in the negative. \"No,\" he said. \"That is not my game, just sow. It suits me better to wait and to watch.\" A grim smile then passed over Jonathan's face. \" And,\" he added, \u2014 \" and I shall get some money to carry on my little legal affair about the Earldom of Whitcombe ; for I wdl, most assuredly, ha the representative of the younger branch of the Whtt combe family myself.\" Wild was a man of rapid resolution. He made up his mind not to render the least assistance to the pursuivant in the capture of the Eirl of Whitcombe ; but he likewise renolved that from the vantage post he held he would collect all the information in his power t. enable him to carry out the affair himself. And so it did. In a few minutes he saw the pursuivant enter the house, after placing his men on guard at the doors ; and then Jonathan WUd crossed the way and spoke to the coachman. He was exactly situated to get such information. But a strange idea had come over WUd while he was in hiding in the doorway of Lord Warring dale's old chambers \u2014 an idea which gave him some uneasiness. \" Hilloa! what is up here ?\" \" That's no business of yours,\" was the reply. \" You don't kno w that Look at me!\" WUd clambered up on one of the front wheels, -and then the coachman saw his face and knew him. There were few, indeed, of that class of men who were otherwise tban perfectly familiar with the hideous countenance of Jonathan WUd. * Yes, sir,\" he said, \" I do know you.\" \" Oh, you do ?\" \" Mr. Jonathan Wild.\" It was that Warringdale was not dead. Up to that evening, or rather night 'or night it was, WUd was certainly under the 'mpression that he had left the dead body of Lord Warringdale to rot in that dismal vault in the old Abbey of West minster. Something, however, that took place in con nexion with the suite of chambers that had been in the use and occupation of Warringdale distorb-d this notion. \"Good ! Now what is the little game here ?\" \" A warrant for the arrest of the Earl of Whit- \u25a0combe.\" \" Ha ! That's it, is it ? Then they won't get him!\" While he, WUd, stood in the dark doorway, with his regards fixed upon Whitcombe House, he had heard some movement in the chambers. The outer door had then opened, and a man, with his face wrapped up, had issued forth. Jonathan, however, recognised him in a mo moment as the reaUy deaf, or pretended deaf, valet of Lord Warringdale, whom he had so frequently seen there. WUd dropped from the coach-box and disap peared in the darkness so suddenly that the coach man might be excused for believing that like other evil spirits, he had the real or supposed capacity of disappearing beneath the surface of the earth. But Jonathan went no further than the back of the coach. In that position of advantage he considered what it would be best for him to do ; and he was not long in coming to a determination. It was the impulse of the instant that induced Jonathan to speak as this man passed him."], [116, "110 EDnii HERON. And it was the incaution of the instant that in duced the pretended stone deaf man to reply to him. \" Since yon are a constable, Mr. Wild,\" said th mortified pursuivant, \" I need have no hesitation in stating to you that I hold a Privy Council warrant for the apprehension of the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" I know it.\" \"Good night!\" \" Good night sir !\" That was aU that passed. Bnt the tone of voice confirmed Jonathan in the \"But he has managed to slip throngh my fingers I\" \" Of course. Ha ! ha ! Of course. He is much too slippery a customer for you to take ; but if the warrant is backed by a goodly reward, and handed to me, I wUl take him.\" \" And so,\" replied the pursuivant, \" I shall stand in the position of an officer who has failed in his duty, which has to be delegated to another?\" notion that this man was tbe deaf valet. The answer, so prompt and pat, likewise con vinced him that the deafness was only assumed. What was that man doing there ? Who was he ? Did he come on Warringdale's account or on his own, to those chambers ? These were questions which Jonathan Wild put to himself anxiously. But he had no means at that moment of reply ing to them. Only the whole circumstance had one effeot, and that was to engender the doubt in Wild's mind if he could be quite sure of the death of Lord War ringdale. At the moment, the interest that the affairs at Whitcombe House produced challenged his atten tion, but the doubt remained. And now, once more, we look upon the thief taker, who seems destined to have some interest ing adventures on that night, orouching down behind the coach of the pursuivant From that post of observation he saw al! that took place in the next quarter of an hour. He saw Tom Bipon come out and speak to the coachman. \" No ; I wUl save you that. You shaU go with me. Make your report to the Secretary of State, at once, or the President of the Council \u2014 it matters not which ; say that the Earl of Whitcombe has escaped, and get the reward named \u2014 it should be a good round sum for a peer;\u2014 meet me then close by the Palace Yard by Westminster Bridge in two hours' time from now. You shall share both tha reward and tho credit \" \"Mr. Wild, I am much beholden to you. Your presence will be an assurance of success ; and, from what yon say, I fancy you know where to hunt up this fellow?\" \" I do ; bnt it will take me the time I mention to get together a force of some eight or ten men to go with us on the venture. I shall expect you to bring as many, and then you wUl see \" \" What, Mr. Wild ?\" \" Why, you will see what you shall see ; and one thing will be the capture of the Earl of Whitcombe. Good evening, for the present. Keep faith with me, and be true to yeur apppintmect, or I wUl do the job myself.\" \" No, Mr. WUd ; be assured I shall be there.\" WUd, without another word, sprung out of the coach ; and then, after waiting quietly till it was driven off with the discomfited and disappointed pursuivant, he walked two or three doors down St James's Street towards Pall Mall. He saw Ogle bring round Daisy from the stable. He saw Felix Heron himself make his appear ance, as if resignedly in custody. But Wild was not eo easily taken in as the pur suivant \" Something is going to happen,\" he whispered to himself. Wild was quite right It was with no sm .11 amusement and appToba tien that he saw Heron dart through the coach and mount Daisy on the other side. He was quite pleased, too, at the little fracas between Ogle and Le Jenne- A small throng of persons were standing round a doorstep, on whioh lay a man in a state of insen sibility, who had been picked up in the road. That man was Le Jeune. \" Go it 1\" said WUd \" Off to Epping ! That is it; and that is what will ju-t suit me!\" In the midst of the confusion, then, and while the pursuivant did not know what to do, Wild quietly stepped inside the coach, and sat himself Uown in the most composed manner possible. And so, when tha bustle and confusion were all over, and the unhappy pursuivant was at his wit's end, and could see nothing to do but to get into the coach and make a report of his non- success, he came plump upon Jonathan. \" Tha other side, if you please,\" said WUd sharply. The unfortunate pursuivant very nearly feU out of the coach. There wa3 an ugly _ calp wound on his forehead, which the butt of the pistol in the vigorous hand of Ogle had inflicted ; and the opinion of the sur rounding people seemed to be tnat the wounded man was at death's door. \"Clear away \u2014 clear away!\" cried Wild, as he pushed his way unceremoniously among the pec pie. \" Who are you, I should like to know ?\" growled a burly-looking fellow, into whose ribs Wild had punched his elbows very roughly. \" Would you like to know ?\" WUd put on one of his most ugly looks as he asked this question ; and as the light of the lamp at the corner of Pall Mall fell upon his face, it was recognised by several people present. \"Jonathan WUd! It's Jonathan WUd!\" was the cry. The very u'terance of the name of the no torious thief-takrr acted like a magical solvent upon the crowd, for it disappeared right and left in a few seconds, and WUd was left alone with Le Jeune. \" Oh, don't mind me. sir,\" added Wfld. \" I'm a friend, although there's no need to sit on my lap \" \" Who and what on earth are you ?\" \"Jonathan WUd! I fancy that answers both questions?\" \" What, Jonathan Wild, the famous\u2014 I mean the notorious thief-taker ?\" \" Just what you please,\" said Wild. \" I never quarel about terms. But what are you going to do ? It seems that your man has escaped you ? Ah! \u2014 he's an old band at such tricks ; and even I \u2014 I, Jonathan WUd, have been foiled by Felix Heron, the highwayman, who now calls hi ueell' the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \"Ha!\" he said; \"that was a smart tap on the head. Ogle hits hard.\" Le Jeune stUl looked confused, although it was evident enough that he breathed."], [117, "111 EDITH HERON. \" I hope,\" said Jonathan, as he folded his arms npon his chest and looked down on the wounded man \u2014 \" I hope the day will come when I shall give Ogle a better tap ou the head than that, although not at all for the purpose of avenging you, my fine fellow.\" The confused, half stunned villain staggered ff\u00a3 a few paces alone. WUd then overtook him, and put out his foM in his way, whioh Le Jeune blundered over fa stantly, falling heavily to the pavement. \" Lie there till you're wanted at Tyburn,\" said WUd, \" for all I care.\" With all the coolness in the world, then, WUd walked over the prostrate form of Le Jeuno, tread ing upon him with his heavy boots as though he had been so much insensible matter ; and without once turning round to see the condition in which he left him, he took his way down to West minster. Lo Jeune opened his eyes, and looked dreamily about him. The blood, that had begun to flow freely from his wound, was bringing him to his senses more rapidly and surely than any stimulant could have done. \" He will recover, of course,\" said Wild. \" This fellow is born to be hanged, and it wUl never do for him to slip off in this kind of way, in a street brawl.\" \"So!\" he muttered, \"Warringdale lives; and the idea that sounded so improbable, aad which has been haunting me for some time, is really a 'set. Warringdale lives, and has taken to the road! By Jove! it seems to run in the family. The White Highwayman, is he, of Blackheath ? Now, I almost begin to respect that rascal, and to think that he reaUy has more courage than I gave him credit for. Never mind, he'll keep \" Jonathan WUd made an impatient gesture with his arm, as though he would throw aside all suggestions as regarded Lord Warringdale, or any one else that might interfere with his pursuit of the Earl of Whitcombe. \" Where am I ?\" said Le Jeune faintly. \" Oh, you're all right !\" \" What has happened ?\" \"Nothing particular ! Take my arm! There, that'll do ! Can you stand easy ? A little sickish, perhaps, but that'll come all right. Don't mind me, I'm a good leaning stock!\" \"I \u2014 I feel so confused.\" \" Of course you do, aud it's a pity.\" \" A pity ? \u2014 a pity ? What's a pity ? My head aohes !\" \" I should think it did ! Every one is not blessed with so thick a skull as mine ! I've had fifty such cracks, and didn't think much of them !\" It was not that Jonathan really intended to assist the pursuivant in the capture of Felix Heron. \" Who are you?\" said Le Jeune, in an evi dently half conscious way, for ha was not suffi cently recovered to recognise Wild, although, under ordinary circumstances, he must have known him in a moment He had a darker motive at the bottom of his heart. It was the murder of the young and gal lant Earl of Whitcombe that WUd contemplated, and hoped to be able to perpetrate. The presence of the pursuivant with the war rant of the Privy Council he only wanted as a cover for the foul deed which he hoped would remove the principal obstacle to his vigorous par suit of the Earldom \u00a9f Whitcombe in his own person. Jonathan was sUent for a few seconds : he had been revolving in his mind an important question, he wished to put to Le Jenne ; and although it was one he knew perfectly well he would get no answer to under ordinary circumstances, yet he now reckoned on the confused state of intellect of the villain who was leaning so heavUy upon his arm, to get at an important truth. It struck Wild that if Lord Warringdale really lived, no one was more likely to be aware of the fact than Le Jeune. What was a human life to WUd ? What was the desolation which the murder of 6uch a man as Felix Heron might produce to him, in comparison with the objects of his ambi tion ? \" Well, my friend,\" said Wild, keeping up a slight alteration in his voice which he had as sumed from the first \u2014 \" well, my friend, I congratu late you upon getting much better ; aud when you see my Lord Warringdale, pray give my compU ments to him.\" Nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing ! Jonathan Wild had no difficulty whatever, for he was known to be an excellent paymaster, and always to keep his Uttle pecuniary engagements, in procuring ten or a dozen mounted men in Westminster. \"Lord Warringdale?\" \" Yes, you know him well enough, I'm quite sure ; and I say give my compliments to him \u2014 Mr. Smith's compliments.\" \" I will \u2014 I wiU. I wish \u2014 I wish I was not so dizzy. I want to go to Blackheath, to take him the news \" With those he waited close to the Palace Yard, expecting the arrival of the pursuivant with at least an equal number ; and then he determined to ride at once to Epping Forest Ior his instinct told him that there he wonld find Felix Heron. He calculated much upon the suddenness of the attack to ensure a victory, for surely nothing would be further from the imagination of Heron than to suppose that Jonathan Wild was upon his heels. \" Blackheath ?\" \" Yes, of course yoa know, Mr. Smith, that he is there, and that the White Highwayman and my Lord Warringdale are one and the same per son. It was clever\u2014 very clever, wasn't it? \u2014 how he tricked that rascal, Jonathan Wild, into a be lief that he was dead. Yes, dead. How my head swims round and round ! I scarcely know where I am, or what I say. Who did you say you were ? A friend of Lord Warringdale's ? Ah ! catch old birds with chaff \u2014 chaff ! I'm not going to tell yon where he is \u2014 oh no, no ! I haven't said a word, have I ? How my head swims !\" \"It may swim a Uttle more for all I care,\" said Wild. The two hours had scarcely passed away, when the clatter of horses' feet announced to Jonathan the approach of the discomfited officer with the party he was to bring to aid and assist in the pursuit of Heron. \" Ah!\" said WUd, \"there you are, Mr. Pursui vant ; and as I perceive you are a man of your word as regards time, I have exceUent hopes of success- \" Mr. WUd, a word with you.\" \"What is it?\" \"I cannot go with you.\" He roughly shook Le Jeune from his arm."], [118, "112 EDITH HERON. \" Indeed 1 Well the service is one of great danger, I admit.\" \" it is not that ; but I was compelled to see the rjuder Secretary of State about the reward that was to be offered for the apprehension of the Earl of Whitcombe, and he says that there wiU be none.\" had placed sentinels in such a manner at the differ ent outlets from the forest, that it was scarcely possible any one could leave it without his know ledge. His object was, upon any alarm, to concentrate his force in that particular direction. But Jonathan had no intention, without some very great inducement to do so, to make his way actually into the forest among the trees. The danger of ouch a proceeding was manifesUy great, for his men might easily be picked off, even with pistol shots, if Heron and his band chose to take such stringent measures. On the contrary, he hoped by waiting to catch either Heron himself, or some of his band indi vidually, and so reduce the force. We shall see ho w far he succeeded. Tom Bipon, having made, with the help of Mrs. Ogle, all his arrangements, assumtd, with the basket on his arm, in which he had some tea, sugar, and a few odd articles of clothing, all the appearance of a country lout of a boy who might well have lost his way in Epping Forest. Perhaps if Tom Bipon had had better informa tion he would hardly hare entered on such an ex pedition. Slrange to 6ay, however, Tom never suspected that it was Jonathan Wild he had to encounter. \" None ? Confusion ! \" \" Nay, Mr. Wild, don't be hasty. It is true that there will be no reward offered for the apprehen sion of the Earl of Whitcombe, since it appears tbat His Majesty will be quite satisfied if he never appears agaiu ; but for the Captain of a band of freebooters in Epping Forest there wiU be a thou sand pounds paid.\" \"Good! isee!\" \" Of course you do ; and at the same time you will comprehend that 1 cannot go with yon, since I do not belong to the criminal police \u2014 my only constabulary ctfice being in connexion with the warrauts issued by the Privy CouncU.\" \" To be sure.\" \" ButI wish you every success, and have brought you thirteen mounted men, upon whom you can rely.\" \" Thanks, thanks, Mr. Pursuivant ; and you too may rely upon it, that if I do catch the noble highwayman, that peer or no peer, I wUl take good care a slice of the reward shaU find its way into your pocket.\" The pursuivant probably had his grave doubts upon thaf. point, but he kept them to himsblf if he had, aud Jouathan Wild separated from him with mutual expressions of good-will. \" Now, gentlemen aU !\" said Wild, addressing the strong mounted party he had under his com mand ; . you know me, or you ought to know me. I am Jonathan WUd ; and when 1 go on an expe dition I generally go through with it, and no flinching. If any of you are afraid of a few hard knoeks, don't come.\" The imitation crying that Tom began, aud kept up, was a perfect thing of the kind. It was a wretched, drawling sort of howl that could be heard a considerable distance. It soon reached the ears of Wild and his party. \" What beast of the wood is that ?\" growled Jonathan. \" It's somebody crying, sir,\" said one of the horseman. \" Crying ! \u2014 crying ! What the deuce does any body mean by crying here ? \" \"Boo! boo! I wonders where I is! Anan ! I don't know my ways, I don't ! Boo! boo! If I'd only a knowed as I should lose my ways I wouldn't a corned arter nuts, I wouldn't. Bou 1 boo! boo!\" \" Some idiot !\" said Wild. \" It's some stupid country boy,\" said the mem ber of the party of horBemen who appeared to take upon himself to tie a kind of spokesman for the rest No one stirred. \" We a?e quite content, Mr. Wild,\" said one of them. \" The reward is a thousand pounds ?\" It is. ** How much are we to have ?\" \" There are twenty- three of you,\" replied Jonathan, \" and I purpose to take half the thousand ponnds to myself, and divide the other half among you. WUl that do?\" \" It will. Agreed ! agreed !\" \" Come on, then ; follow me.\" The troop \u2014 really a. formidable one \u2014 clattered over old Westminster Bridge, at the heels of Jonathan Wild, who was himself mounted on a powerful black horse he had hired for this occa- \" Bring him in.\" \" He is close at hand, I think.\" \" boo ! boo ! Whatever wiU missus say, and whatever will Dame Mobberly say ? Boo ! Shan't I catch it, too, all down my back ! Bool boo !\" The horseman who had spoken to Wild, dis mounted ; and while one of his companions held his steed by the bridle, he pushed his way cau tiously through the thicket in the direction of Tom Bipon. Tom heard him fast enough. \" Boo ! boo ! Oh, dear ! If I could only find a feUow's way out of the wood ! Oh! oh! Shan't I catch it from missus ! \u2014 and I haven't found any nuts, neither 1 Oh! oh! Oh, dear! \u2014 oh 1\" The dismounted man had reached Tom, and laid his hand heavily on his shoulder. Tom kuew he was close to him, and that bs was about to do what he did, as wall as possible; but Tom thought it expedient to fall down flat among the old, decayed leaves and litter of the forest, and to be in the greatest possible fright \"Get up!\" \" Oh! oh! Don't! dont!\" sion. CHAPTER XL. TOM RIPON IS OF FSSF.STIAL SERVICE TO EDITH AT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT. We return to ihe forest Captain Heron and his men still kept close be hind the taU trees, and in the deep shadow of the underwood, waiting for a more distinct report concerning the party that attacked the wood, than had jet been obtained. That report was expected from Tom Bipon. Jonathan Wild, on reaching Epping, which by a forced march he had, as no doubt has been ob nerved, a very few hours after Captain Heron, \" Don't what ? Who is hurting you\u2014 oh, stupid?\""], [119, "EDITH HERON. 113 It wag only the darkness that could possibly be friend him. In that, he felt, lay his only chance of escaping almost instant recognition. But Tom kept hU wits about him, for aU that and did not forget what he was about, and what was the object of his presenoe there. He counted Wild's troop. \" Seventeen of 'em,\" said Tom, to himself. The rest were acting as sentinels. \" Bring that boy here,\" said Wild. \" Yes, sir. Come on, will you?\" Tom was drigged forward, olose to Jonathan'. horse, but it was much too dark for either of them to see each other's faces weU. k Sh i I\u2014 oh ! Soo !\" \" Hold that row, do, aud come along with me.\" \" Oh, sir ! Please, kind, good sir, will you show * fellow tha way out ot the wood ?\" \" I will, if you keep close to me.\" \" I wool, sir. Oh, dear! \u2014 oh, dear! I didn't Ind any nuts, if you please, sir \u2014 or I wouldn't mind giving you one !\" \" Oh ! You are a liberal-minded youth, you <_re, and too generous by half !\" \" Yes, sir ; that's what Granny says!\" \" Come ou quicker, idiot !\" The man seized Tom by the arm, and dragged him along, while he kept up a series of awful howls that were dreadful to hear. \" Good gracious !\" cried Wild. \" Knock that boy on the head, do, somebody !\" Tom heard the voice of Wild, and knew it in a moment, aud at tha same moment he felt his own danger to ba very great No. 15-\u2014 EorrH Heron. \" Who are you ?\" \"Dick, sir, if you please.\" \"Dick who?\" \" Only Dick, sir; not Dickoo.\" \" What a specimen of an agrioulturist donkey!* \" Yes, sir, if you nlease.\""], [120, "114 EDITH HERON. \" Oh, the fellow is an idiot ! We shall get no thing from him.\" \" It's worth trying, Mr. WUd. He seems, by what he says, to have been in the wood some time, and he may have seen something of some body.\" \" It is possible. Now, boy, attend to me.\" \" Yes, master, I wool.\" \" You wool, indeed. You had better. Do you know what this is ?\" The moment he saw the dash of a match with which a lantern was about to be lit he flung dowu tha basket and made a rush towards the cover of the wood. As evil fortune would have it one of tha mounted men had, unnoticed by Tom, dismounted to take a stone out of his horse's foot, whioh had made the creature go lame the last mUa or two ; and this man was, with the horse's fore foot-in his hand, stooping down exactly in Tom's way. Over him went Tom. Wild held up a riding whip he carried. \" Yes, I wool.\" \" I say do yon know what this is ?\" Tom thought it prudent not to aggravate Wild too far, so he said. \" Yes, I does.\" \" Very good. Now in this hand I hold a rather sharp thouged whip, and in the other a shiiling.\" \" Oh, lor' !\" \" Ah, you know what a shUling is !\" \" Oh, don't I master ! bnt I never had on\u00ab. I had sixpence once, drat it ! that I had. Boo ! boo ! it makes me cry and feel bad now, 'cos 1 lost 'un.\" Horse and man and Tom went roiling and sprawling to the ground together. That fall was fatal to Tom's hopes of escape. He was seized in a moment \"Ha! ha!\" oried WUd; \"there is something more in all this than meets the eye; but it shall soon meet it, and that too, an eye that is not easUy deceived. Bring him here!\" Tom was now dragged towards Wild without any ceromony, and his hat knooked off. \"Holdup the light!\" The beams from the lens of the now lighted lan tern fell full upon Tom's face. Wild laughed aloud in his most detestable style, stopping as usual with startling abruptness; and then he said, as he ironically smiled aud listed his hat an inch or two from his head, \" Mr. Bipon, I hope I see yon well ?\" \" Quite,\" said Tom.\" \" Be quiet\" \" Yes, master. But I did lose 'un.\" \" Be quiet I say. Answer me truly what I shall ask of you, aud you shall have the shilling. Be stupid, or obstinate, or lying, and you shall have the horsewhip about your back.\" \"I wool.\" \" Have you seen anybody in the wood ?\" \" Yes, master.\" \" De \u2014 lighted to hear it\" \" Thank you, Johnny. How are you ?\" \" As well as the presence of an impudent your g scamp will let me.\" \" He's abusing some of you,\" said Tom, as he looked round upon tbe throng of horsemen, who were regarding this meeting with curiosity. \" Hold him !\" added Wild. \" What's your name, by the by?\" This question was put to the horseman who had rather thrust himself forward in the party. \" Bond,\" was the reply. \" A good name, too. Mr. Bond, you will please to put some bonds upon this boy, and keep him in bondage, or it will be the worse for yon.\" Tom had no chance now of escape. His hands were forced behind him, and tied together by the wrists ; but although the cord hurt him, he kept a smiling face towards Wild. \" Now, Mr. Tom Bipon,\" said WUd, \" I will trouble you totell me the truth \u2014 the whole truth \u2014 and nothing but the truth, or \" Wild, as he spoke, stooped down, and inserted exacUy in the left ear of Tom Bip_n the muzzle of a pistol. \" Or what Johnny ?\" said Tom. \" I wUl shoot veu?\" \"Shoot away !\" \"Are you mad?\" \"No, Johnny; but you will be, if you shoi-t me. It's murder ! \u2014 not that you care about that at all \u2014 only for another thing.\" \"What other thing?\" \" There are too many witnesses in the way, Johnny.\" Tom was right A sort of murmur had arisen among the mounted men, and he felt that it would be an act that would, in its consequences, rebound upon his own head. But he was not disposed t* give up the hope of obtaining some information from Tom which might serve his purpose. \" Speak 1\" he oried, in blustering tones\u2014 \"speak! or not all the world oaa save you! Where is Felix Heron?\" \" Who ?\" \" A man on a black horse, and another man on a brown horse, and a bit of a boy ahind him on the brown horse ; and he said, says he, to the man ou the black horse, says he, ' Captain,' says he, ' Daisy sniffs,' says he \u2014 ' Daisy sniffs the forest air,' says he.\" \"Good!\" said Wild. \"You are not one half such a fool as I thought you.\" \" No, I beau's, master.\" \" What else did you see or hear ?\" \" Why, then the man on the black horse he says, says he, ' Ogle,' says he, ' I can't abide,' says he, ' the old spot' says he, ' So come on.'says he ; ' and I shan't feel easy,' says he, ' till I leaves,' says he, \u2022 old Epping,' says he, ' mil cs away,' says he.\" \"Perdition!\" \" No, no ! That's wrong.\" \"What's wrocg?\" \" He didn't say that\" \" Peace, idiot ! I did not say he did. What more happened then ?\" \" Why, then off they went among the trees, and was gone. And f says to myself, says I \" \" SUence I\" \" No, I didn't\" \" SUence, I say !\" Tom got adroitly out of the way of a slash which Jonathan WUd, with right good will, meant to give him with the riding-whip. \" I wonder,\" he said, \" if I may rely upon the information of this boy. There is a mixture of stupidity and cunning about him. I will see his face. Who has a light here, or the means of getting one?\" \"I have, Mr. Wild.\" \" Ah!\" thought Tom, \" I'm afraid it is all up with me now.\" Tom Bipon felt quite sure that U Jonathan got one good look at his face he would be recognised and taken prisoner ; and the idea of being in such straits was not at all agreeable to him."], [121, "115 EDITH HERON, Tom began to sing : \u2014 \" Back, Captain, back !\" cried Tom. \" Never mind meJ\" \" ' Why are you wandering here, I pray ?' Bang went Jonathan Wild's pistol. He fired fuU in the direction of Felix Heron ; An old man said to a maid one day.\" A bine kind of rage came over Wild's face. It was a thousaid wonders that he did not pull the trigger of the pistol, and, despite all consequences, take Tom's life ; but by one of those powerful efforts of the will which men of strong passions are at times capable of, he restrained himself. \" Wait ! \u2014 wait !\u2014 wait !\" he said. and, in good truth, he cared not much at that moment what life he took, so that be could have the satisfaction of shedding some one's blood. When the smoke from the discharged pistol roUed aside, Captain Heron was gone I \"Forward! Follow me!\" yelled WUd. \"He is here, and I must and will have him !\" Jonathan was on the point of setting his horse into a mad gallop right in among the trees, when, from quite the other direction \u2014 that fs to say, immediately behind him \u2014 came another voice, but so like that of Captain Heron that even Tom could hardly persuade himself that it was not his ; and that voice repeated the same words precisely that Heron ha-1 used : \u2014 \" I'm in no hurry,\" replied Tom. \" Take yonr time, Johnny !\" WUd put the pistol back into his pocket He then spoke to the troop he bad with him in a voice that was thick and hoarse with passion. \" Two of you,\" he said \u2014 \" two of you look after the boy. The rest follow me.\" \" Hist sir I\" said Bond. \" What is that \" A hooting sound, like some one making a not very successful attempt to imitate an owl, came upon the night air. But it did not come from the forest \" Hold ! Not while Captain Heron Eves and rnles in old Epping Foi est!\" It was physically impossible that Captain Heron could in so short a space of time have changed his position in relation to Jonathan Wild's party so completely. A long belt of almost impervious brushwood was immediately in front of where Wild sat upon his horse, and the only mode of getting past that obstruction was through tbe few straggling trees on the confines of which Heron had first shown himself, and which formed in truth the commence ment of OLe of those forest glades which \u2014 like so many broad natural roads \u2014 penetrated deeply into tbe tangled intricacies of the wood. It was Jien, we say, physically impossible that Felix Heron could show himself at that point one moment and the next ot one exactly opposite to The sound, on the contrary, appeared rather to come from a point on the highway, some three or four hundred yards from where tbe mounted party of Jonathan Wild had taken up their position. Tom Bipon was to the full as much taken by surprise at these sounds as Jonathan Wild was, and the start ho gave convinced WUd that Tom Bipon really did not know from whom they came or what they portended. One thing, however, was qnite certain ; aud that, was, that tho sounds were intended as a signal to tha scoots who usually kept watch and ward in the wood. In that case, too, it was to be presumed that they were uttered by some friend or visitor of Caj-tain Heron. Who could that friend or visitor be ? it Well might Tom Bipon be astonished and be wildered. Tom was lost in conjectures. But Wild was not a man to waste precions time. He at onco placed one hand to his month, and executed a very good imitation of the call of an owl. And well might Jonathan Wild doubt for one moment the evidence of hie senses, and ask him self if he had really seen Captain Heron at all, or, if be had, in which direction he was again to look for him. \"No, no!\" shouted Tom Bipon. \"Back!\u2014 back ! Whoever you are, turn bick ! Hawks abroad ! \u2014 hawks abroad 1 Back, I say !\" Tom had said that mnch before Wild could stop him, and then he clutched him by the back of the neck savagely. \" Kill this boy ! Cut his throat 1 Smash him I\" he shouted savagely. \"Hold! Not while Captain Heron lives and riles in old Epping Forest I\" cried a voice; and, mounted still on Daisy, Heron himself appeared from the wood beiore the eyes of WUd and his troop. The man who carried the lantern was on that side Jonathan Wild's horse which faced the wood, for there lay the interest of the whole expedition. __ all the rays of that straggling lantern, which went in the other direction, could have been col lected, and flung towards the forest, certainly that would have bsen done. But now the whole complexion of affairs changed. The man whom they came to seek \u2014 the man who boasted that he ruled in Epping Forest was in the other direction. It was Wild himself who first of all gathered presence of mind to recognise the change, and ho caUed out aloud, \" Shift the light\u2014 shift the light ! Perdition and fury ! Ha is behind.\" Hurriedly the lantern was turned, and rather than waste time to get round Jonathan Wild's horse, the man who held it thrust his hand and arm over the back of the saddle ; so that while Jonathan himself was in partial obscurity, the light fell with such power as it had broad and full in a direction which those words from Captain Heron had indicated as his locality. CHAPTER XLI. JONATHAN WILD IS BEWILDERED BUT HE ES GAG US EN A PURSUIT, ASD MAKES A PRISONER. The lantern, which had been Ut by the order of Jonathan Wild, sent around it a broad, though iaint balo of light That halo of light decreased in intensity to wards its remoter circumference; so that although Captain Heron was actually within it, he only looked like some spectre horseman, who might ohow himself for a moment in the pale mconlight, and then disappear for ever. And there he was. Or there he seemed to be. Mounted on a black horse, and attired in every respect as Heron might be expected to be attired, when taking again the command of that band of desperadoes in Epping Forest he appeared"], [122, "116 EDITH HERON. scarcely forbear reining in his steed, as the sudden change took place on the face of nature \" This is pleasant\" he cried ; \" for the first time, I think the moonlight fair.\" These words had hardly escaped his lips when exclamations burst from some half-dozen of his men, and as many eager hands were pointed in one particular direction up the road. There was a horseman. But it was only for a fleeting moment The horseman turned almost as quickly as Jonathan Wild's eyes could rest upon him, and shouting out \" Ho ! for a race, U Jonathan WUd has the courage to follow on the footsteps of Felix Heron,\" he darted off apparently on the high road to London. A couple of bounds of the horse were sufficient to take him out of the sphere of the light The moon was hidden again behind a ruck of clou s. There could be no mistaking the costume. It was that of Felix Heron. There couli be no mistake either in what the The trees, the meadows, the sky, and the road were mingled together iu one common blackness ; and i seemed as if this horseman, who had ap peared more like a spectre than aught human, but who, in addition to having all the bearing and aspect of Felix Heron, had not scrupled to an nounce himself as that personage, had vanished again into the night air, leaving no trace behind. Yes \u2014 ah, yes \u2014 there was a trace. Tbe regular beat of the horse's hoofs. The road was hard, aud there could be no mis -takin tbe sound of tl.ar. gallop, which might be carry ng Jonathan WUd's prey far from him. Epping Forest was nothing to Jonathan. Ha cared not one straw for the deeds of rapine or violence lhat might be enacted in its leafy glades. horseman was attempting to do. He was trying iu vain to induce his horse to leap the hedge, which was rather low at that point, and so get into the meadows which skirted the roadway. The horse, however, was either tired or scared at the moonbeams, for twice it swerved at the moment it should have taken the leap, when spurred at the hedge by its rider. \" We have him !\" cried Wild in an exultant tone. \" We have him ! he cannot escape us now.\" \" Hurrah!\" shouted the troop. No donbt, visions of the numerous gratifications the promised five hundred pounds that were to be divided amongst them would produce, floated across the imagination of every one, and they were as eager in the pursuit as Jonathan Wild himself. The band that owned FeUx Heron as their master could be pouuced upon at any time. It was Heron hiuistlf that was the great prize, and it was maddening to see it vanishing before his gaze. . *_ . .... .... . n ...\u00bb \" Yes, gentlemen all, we have him, for he has had the imprudence to leave Epping Forest on a horse that may be a good one, but is no more to be compared to his famous Daisy than I am in strength to an elephant; so I say we have got him\" \" Take that boy up behind one of you,\" yelled WUd. \" Twenty guineas extra, whether or no we catch Felix Heron, to the man who brings that boy safe to my house in Newgate Street And now forward, and follow me. His Grace of Whit combe has paid but a flying visit to Epping Forest and is off to town again.\" Wild piused but for a few seconds now, to see that one of the horsemen took secure possession of Tom Bipon : and, with the assistance of a com rade \u2014 to whom, probably, be in his turn offered some bribe \u2014 got him firmly fastened behind him on his horse. A third time, and a fourth, the distant figure on the black steed made an attempt to force the horse to leap the hedge. And the fourth time the creature tried the feat. It was a failure. It resulted in a fall. Not so complete a fall as that horse and rider lay even for a moment in the roadway, but they were separated, and the peril of the horseman from his pursm rs was largely increased by the fact that he was on foot, although he still kept hold of the bridle. This accomplished, WUd had nothing to wait for He set spurs to his steel ; and, at a gallop which covered the ground at an enormous rate, he sat off on tha London road, followed closely by his troop. The horse was quite sufficiently scared to make it a difficult matter to remove him ; and, indeed, before that could be accomplished, Jonathan Wild rode up. At that point of the road it was almost impossi ble for aDy horseman to deviate to the right or to the left tor a space of nearly two miles. Tall and luxuriant hedge rows so completely 6nut iu the way, that it would have been a difficult matter to leave it, except to pass through the lodge gate of some estate. That was not a likuly thing for a fugitive on horseback to do. \" Captain Felix Heron,\" he said, \" you are my prisoner ! Ah ! you resist do you ? I see you want to shoot me! Self-defence warrants any thing ! Take the death you have braved so often, aud which wUl remove you for ever from my path 1\" Wild spoke all this with great rapidity, and with a leud voice \u2014 for he wanted the troop of mounted men at his heels to hear every word of it so that their account of the death of the Earl of Whitcombe \u2022 raid correspond with his. Oae effect however, of this narrow, closed-in roadway was, that it was in a state of pitchy dark ness ; but as though the very elements of nature ware that night in favour of WUd's enterprises, a brisk wind rose up, and, tearing aside the cloud* which obscured the face of the beautiful moon, permitted broad beams of silvery light to find their way di ectly downward on the road, and to bring into bold relief every spray of leaves or blossoms from the hedges, and every pebble that lay in the horee-track. This flood of moonlight was eo sudden and so unexpected\u2014 for the clouds had broken asunder like a soUd waU\u2014 tnat Jonathan WUd could He levelled one of his holster pistols full at the face of the horseman, who wore a small black lace vizor; but before the words were fairly out of his mouth which he meant to precede the death shot the supposed Felix Heron, with the disen gaged hand \u2014 the other holding the bridle of the horse \u2014 tore off the lace vizor, and as the moon beams fell full upon tbe fair face, Jonathan WUd recognised the lineaments of Edith instead of those of Felix Heron. His finger was so exactly upon the trigger of"], [123, "117 EDITH HERON. I the pistol that he cculd not refrain from giving the necessary touch to discharge it ; but along with that touch he altered the aim, and the bnllet flew sufficiently far and wide over Edith's head to absolve WUd from the intention of trying to kill her. to lift off your hat or I fancy these gentlemen wUl be dragging you to prison.\" Edith almost involuntarily, at these words from Jonathan WUd, lifted her hat, and a stray curl or two of her beautiful hair escaped from its confine ment. Vexation and surprise then kept him silent for a moment or two, dnring which time his troop came up to him with a rush, and some half-dozen of them, with shouts of congratnlation, hastily dis mounted, and rushed upon Edith. \" Forbear,\" she said, gently, \" if you be men ! \" Tell me, why am I attacked thus npon the public highway ?\" The sweetness of her voice, and the more than earthly beauty of her face in those cold, pale moonbeams, struck every one with amazement Their hands involuntarily dropped from the rude and rough grasps they had made upon her ; and it was left for Jonathan WUd to make what he could of an adventure which had turned out so strangely and so unpropitiously. \"Are you satisfied ?\" said Wild. \" A woman!\" cried every one. But along with this disclosure had come the thought to Edith that surely anything would be better than falling into the hands of Jonathan Wild. There could be no real charge against her; and even if the men who accompanied him were to take her to a prison or before a magistrate, her re lease must quickly follow, while she knew not what unheard-of terrors might be in store for her as the prisoner of the infamous Jonathan. \" Take me \u2014 take me,\" she cried, as these thoughts slashed through her imagination \u2014 \" take me where you wiU \u2014 anywhere \u2014 to any prison, before any justice, so that yon do not leave me in the power of this bold, bad man!\" \" This is too bad,\" said WUd. \" Save me 1 save me !\" added Edith. \" I give myself freely into your custody. I am your pri soner, but not the prisoner of Jonathan Wild.\" \" Let's go with the lady, \"said Bond, \"since the game's up as regards Felix Heron.\" \"Perhaps, gentlemen,\" said Wild, eneeringly, \" it wUl be as weU for you to know who this lady is, before you talk so glibly concerning her.\" \" Oh, no\u2014 not that !\" She shrunk with a natural delicacy from de claring herself the wife of Felix Heron and Coun tess of Whitcombe, attired as she was in that male costume \u2014 her purpose for donning which they could never appreciate- \" Oh, no, no ! Not that\u2014 not that !\" \"Just so,\" said Wild, as he took from his pccket a dreadfully dirty old blue handkerchief, and pretended to touch his eyes with it \" Just so, gentlemen all ; that's the way the wife of one's bosom denies herself !\" Tom Bipon recognised Edith at once ; and the cry that burst from his Ups was not one of the least remarkable episodes of that period of astonish ment WUd felt that he was foiled ; but if there was anything in the whole world which could be a compensation for missing the capture of Felix Heron, it would certainly be such an adventure as this. Ho conjectured \u2014 and conjectured rightly, too \u2014 that nothing could be further from the wishes of Edith than that her incognito should be disco vered; and he hazarded a sort of half appeal, as he said, \" Comrades and gentlemen, all this is a mis take. We have left Felix Heron behind us, and pursued a stranger.\" Edith spoke not a word ; but she drew closer and closer towards the horse, the bridle of which she stiU kept in her band. \" But this stranger,\" continued Wild, \" is, I am sure, a dear friend of Captain Heron's ; and would rather ride to town with Jonathan Wild, than return again to Epping Forest\" \" Yes,\" said Edith faintly. \" But you don't mean to say, Mr. WUd,\" cried Bond, \"that you give up the affair?\" \" Not at all, my good friends ; and on some other occasion \" \" His wife ?\" cried the troop with one accord. \" Yes, gentlemen \u2014 my wUe\u2014 Mrs. Wild. Don't you think she does me credit? But you can easily guess the affliction of my heart at the manner in which she chooses to disport herself. My wife, gentlemen I Pray which of yon will in terfere now ?\" \" Other occasion ?\" echoed everybody. \" Yes, gentlemen, npon some other occasion I shall be happy to accompany yon in search of Felix Heron, the highwayman ; who you will hardly suppose to be such an idiot as to remain in Epping Forest after he has once caught sight of my charming countenance !\" \" Then we've all our trouble for nothing ?\" said Bond. \" It is false\u2014 it is false !\" cried Edith. \" And now, indeed, I must needs declare who and what I am I\" \" Yes,\" said Tom Bipon ; \" and I, too, can de clare it !\" \"Not yet\" said Wild : \" think a little, my lady; for if you will persist that you are not Mrs. WUd \u2014 which, in truth, I ought to be a great deal more sorry than glad to say that you are \u2014 try to make fools of these gentlemen by calling yourself a lady of quality. A duchess or a countess wiU do !\" \"Villain!\" said Edith; \"you know who and what I am ! I am the Countess of Whitcombe !\" \"You hear,\" said WUd, \u2014 \"you hear, gentle men ! Did I not say as much ?\" An incredulous smile passed from face to face, and then the man who had been most foremost in challenging Wild's proceedings, and who was the one who had Tom Bipon behind him on his horse, cried out, \" Well, comrades, I'm satisfied for one ; and iince Mr. WUd has found his better half \u2014 very much the better half I should say \u2014 and sinoe there's no more chance of catching the highway man, I advise that we be off, and we get to town \"Not at all,\" replied WUd, with a hideous sneer. \" You have had a capital ride in the moon light and so have I. You have made one pri soner likewise, for which I mean to pay you. This boy, I mean. He is worth a guinea a-piece aU around. There \u2014 there's the money !\" \" Comrades!\" cried one of the horsemen \u2014 \" com rades, I don't believe aU this. It appears to me that this is very likely to be Captain Heron him self; for we have all heard of Jonathan Wild's schemes and tricks, and this may be one of them, perchance, to save five hundred pounds. \" \" Oh, you think that do you ?\" said WUd. \" On my faith, I do !\" \"Then your faith, my friend, is very great Madam,\" \u2014 addressing Edith \u2014 \" wiU it please you"], [124, "118 EDITH HERON.

You are Countess of Whitcombe\u2014 or you fancy you are ; but I can dispel that delusion ; and, strange as it may sound to you, I think as I sit here on this shadowy roadway that I am the only man on earth who can really confirm you in your title. Think of it, Edith the Countess. May it not be well to be friends with Jonathan Wild ?\" iu time enough to order a good supper at the 'Harrow!'\" \"Agreed! agreed!\" cried the others- \"Good night Mr. Wild\u2014 good night! But I don't think you'll catch us again on a wUd goose chase to Epping Forest\" \" And there's your prisoner,\" added the man who had charge of Tom Ripon, plaoiog him behind Wild on the back of his horse, and care fully securing him by tying his ankles together with a stout cord \u2014 \" there's your prisoner, who I'm heartUy glad to get rid of, for he has been trying to bite me aU the time I have had him.\" Edith clasped her hands in despair. Tom Bipon, too, who might be said never to lose hope, thought himself rather in a dilemma ; for with his hands tied behind him, what could he do? The tone and manner of Wild in uttering these words were both indescribably loathsome to Edith. She could not forbear an exclamation. A very few seconds now sufficed to leave that strangely-assorted party alone together upon the high road to London. Oh, that Felix Heron could have known it! \" Oh, heaven ! For which of my sins, unknow ingly committed, am I exposed to the terrors of this man's most hideous company ?\" This was not in poor Edith's usual style ef language, for she was ever won! to be full of re liance, and holy, dependent trust upon the good ness and mercy of heaven. But she nad suffered much. Ob, that some beneficent spirit could have been found to whisper in his ears the fact ! But, alas ! he had no consciousness of the cir cumstance, that within two miles from where he was, Edith was in the power and custody of Jona than WUd. Wou id he not have forgotten all doubts, all surmises, and flown at once, heart and soul, to the res '.ue ? Her fond, faith ful, gentle heart \u2014 that fount of innocence and dear affection \u2014 bad been fearfully wrung of late ; and we will suppose that if the recording angel noted down these words from Edith \u2014 these words of impatience, he blotted them out again v>ith a tear. Wild scowled upon her and approached her. Some few feet nearer, by slow degrees. It was strange to see this interview between two such different creatures, and yet \u00bbf the same species, taking place beneath the pure, gentla Ught of that sweet young moon. The cold white rays imparted a spiritual cha racter to the whole scene, which it would not have had in the open light of day. Ah, yes ! But he knew it not; and there stood the fair, accomplished, and innocent Countess of Wtiitcombe, looking into the eyes of the greatest ruth in the age had produced, and striving to com pass by that gaze what vUlanous thoughts and projects were chasing each other through his biain Aud WUd looked at her ; and as he did so for the second time in his life, a perception of her rare and peerless beauty came over him. She saw that expression. S he shuddered at it Jouathan Wild had ever presented himself in the light of a remorseless villain ; but gold had been his idol, and greed and rapine had hitherto appeared to overcome all other considerations. What was she now to think ? Edith then made a desperate effort to remount the horse, which by this time had recovered from its flurry and fight occasioned by the leap that had been such a failure. But the eye3 of Jonathan were npon her. \"Forbear!\" he said; \" I know how to speak to such as you are, and I promisa you, Edith, that if you sly from the spot 1 will rid myself of one encumbrance to the active pursuit of you.\" Edith did not know what, he meant There was a look of anguish, too, upon tbe countenanoe of Tom Bipon which inexpressibly alarmed Edith, for she could not resolve it to its right cause, which was that Tom was making terrible efforts, at the cost of the skin of his wriste, to endeavour to get his hands out us ihe bond.- that held them behind his back. He could see that she looked as if she did not So Jonathan WUd graciously explained. \" I know well that both you aud he who I call Felix Heron, but who calls himself the E\u00bbrl of Whitcombe, place great value on the life of thi\u00ab boy, who is a prisoner behiud me.\" \" We do\u2014 indeed we do.\" And then Edith thought that it wonld be weU to speak to Jonathan Wild. There was something so shudderingly fearful about the fixed look with which he regarded her. Sub felt how vain it wonld be to attempt to sly f join him : before she could mouut the horse, he might with a rush be close to her. Fear knocked loudly at her heart and she knew not what to do. How deeply she regretted that she was sn arniedl But the circumstances under which she had ridden tbat night to Epping Forest and as sumed the costume she now wore, were too painful and all-absorbing for her to have thought of providing herself with weapons of defence. She had therefore no power of resistance ; and so she spoke to Jonathan WUd, striving to awaken his fears. \" I know it. I tell you then, Edith, that I will scatter his brains hero upon tho road if you make another attempt to mount that horsa without my most express permission.\" CHAPTER XL II. TOM REPON PROVES HIMSELF ONE TOO MANT FOR JONATHAN. That was the enly avenue to hii apprehension. \" It may be, Jonathan WUd,\" she said, \" that evil fortune has apparenUy placed me la your Edith heard this declaration from Wild with all the regret and terror which it was certain to produce in her mind."], [125, "EDITH HT_EON. 119 Well she knew how just a value her Felix set upon Tom Bipon, aud although she might be said to be estranged from him at the present time, yet his affections and his wishes were as sacred to her as they had ever been. The vapour from the explosion was still in the moonbeams, as she felt Tom Bipon's two honest arms flung around her, and his voice in her ears. \" Get up\u2014 oh ! get up, Lady Edith. It's aU right now. Tom Bipon has settled all scores with old Johnny WUd. Don't faint \u2014 oh, don't pray ! Mother used to faint, and kick sometimes, but she is an old 'un. Don't you do so, Lady Edith\u2014 don't\" \" Oh, no ! no !\" she cried ; \" even you, Wild, dare not do a deed so base.\" Then Wild paraphrased a speech of Macbeth' s, as he said in a gloomy tone, \" What man dare do, that dare I. If any one wUl do more, why then he comes from a lower place than ever I may ex pect to go to.\" He advanced another pace or two as he spoke. Edith clung to the horsa. That at least was a living thing, and it seemed to stand between her aad Jonathan Wild. She lelt as if she could almost have spoken to tho poor dumb brute at that moment and asked it for its active interference in her favour. \" Edith ! Edith !\" exclaimed Wild ; \"Ism not \"No.no! Oh, Tom!\" \" That's right\" \" How did you? How oouid you ?\" \"What?\" \" You were so tied \u2014 so manacled\u2014 such a pri soner !\" \" Wei!, so I was ; but I have been working away with my hands all the while ; and. what with loosening the cord a Uttle, I fancy, and let ting the skin of my wrists go with it 1 got out of it at last\" a man of many fancies; I am not a man of caprices ; I am not a man who ever said much about bright eyes and dimpled cheeks ; and there it is strange to me that I am compelled to say I love you \" \" And I loathe you!\" \" With all my heart!\" added Wild. The words had beeu upon bis lips, and he could not stop himself from uttering them, not withstanding Edith had interpolated such a re buff. \" Yon have suffered I\" \" Bather !\" Poor Tom Bipon cast rather a rueful look at bis hands, which were __ tasked with blood, and there was no mistaking the look of pain that was on his countenance. \" Oh, how mnch I owe yo_\u00bb !\" said Edith, as the tears started to her eyes. \" Don't say a word abou. it \u2014 don't I Pray I It's \u2014 it's ever 8\" mnch better now.\" Then she echoed those words \u2014 \" With all my heart !\" \" Take this. Tom ! Tom ! you shall ever be to me as a dear\u2014 dear \u2014 bro No, ao ! oh, heaven ! no ; not a brother ! Why did 1 think of such a word as brother ?\" Wild's face turned of a livid colour. \" Help! help !\" shouted Edith. \" Help!\" cried Tom Ripon. But there was no help \" One kiss,\" said Wild ; \" one soft, peach-like, lasMous kiss of those sweet lips!\" He sprang fi om his horse. He made two strides towards Edith, and then Tom Bipon nttered a shout of gratification ; and, to the astonishment of Jonathan Wild, Tom was on the front portion of tha -.addle, with his knees drawn up upon it and both his hands at liberty, while he held one of the huge holster-pistols that formed part of the equestrian equipment of Jona than exactly between the horse's ears, and in a line with WUd's head. Tom Biyoa could not make out why or how it was that that word \"brother\" should so mnch affect pcor Edith, because he had no conception of the pailful associations which it produced. \" Lady Edith,\" he said ; \" 1 wiU be any relation you Uke if you won't ory.\" \" I won't. I will try not But do you fee^ easier with this handkerchief round your wounded wrist?\" \" Ever so much : only it's a pity \" \" What's a pity ?\" \" Why, to see .11 this pretty lace getting oveir blood.\" \" No, no ; it is no pity ! To what more worthy use, Tom, could it, be put? There! See, now, I have found something else for the other hand.\" \" Stoep, Edith. I beg your pardon. Miss Edith \u2014 Lady Edith, I mean\u2014 stoop ever so little, and I wU! send a bullet into the rascal's head !\" \" Saved ! saved !\" shrieked Edith. Edith had torn from her vest a strip of exqui sitely-fiDe lace, and with that she bound up Tom Bipon's other wrist, so that he was weU enough provided with costly bandages, since the first one she had used was a handkerchief of such rich texture that half a dozen guineas could scaroely have purchased it And aU th s while Jonathan WUd lay in the ditch, without sense or motion. He was certainly not entirely submerged, for, upon roUing into it he had iaUen over partly upon his back ; and there he lay with his feet in the water, although his breast, face, and three parts of his head were certainly out of it He looked a ghastly object as he lay there with the moonbeams playing upon his face. His eyes were closed. The wig he usually wore had fallen off, dis closing a long scar npon the forehead, half-covered by a black patch, for it was an ancient wound that never had healed perfectly. Both Tom Bipon and Edith happened to cast their eyes simultaneously upon Jonathan WUd She wrenched her wrist from the partial grasp that Wild had taken of it and shrank down to the ground instantly. \" Hoi i \u2014 hold, boy ! Are you mad ? \" cried Wild. \" Not so mad,\" said Tom Bipon, \" as to throw away a good chanee \" Bang ! went tha pistoL \"Ah!\" yelled Wild. He clasped both his hands over his face, and rolled headlong into the ditch or watercourse that was by the roadside. \" A pill for one !\" said Tom Bipon. \" War ranted a full dose ! Hurrah ! Hurrah !\" Edith was bewildered at this sudden change of affairs. Tom had appeared to be so utterly help less, and then had been able not only to help her, bat, as it appeared, to get rid at once and for ever of the arch enemy of her Use, and the lUe of F.lix Heron. The echo of Ihe report of the pistol was itUl in fcer ears."], [126, "120 EDITH HERON. that boy presented two fair, pleasant and bright specimens of humanity fit to associate ; while Jonathan Wild and the toad seemed likewise to associate together in their degree. as he lay thus apparently beyond the pale of human consideration. It was a relief to Edith to hold Tom by the arm ; and the emotion that he, Tom, exhibited may well be excused when it is recollected he was as yet but little more than a boy. And so they olnng together in that shadowy lane, aud looked, as they thought, upon the face of the dead. \" It's only a toad,\" said Tom, with a shudder ; \" but I don't Uke the looks of him, for aU that \" \" Nor I,\" repUed Edith ; \" let us come away. And since you will remain with me, Tom, I tell you that I am glad \u2014 most glad of yonr companion ship I have no father, no mother ; and be who loved me better than all the fathers and aU the mothers the world ever saw, is estranged from me.\" How strange an association! Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, and Tom Ripon, worse than orphan\u2014 a waif and stray upon the great ocean of society, to come to good or to evU as accident might dictate. And any one who could have seen them might well have supposed they had some strange notion that the whole human race had been swept away, and tbat they alone lived in all the world to cling to each other for support and companionship. \" Se is dead ?\" said Edith. \" Never mind,\" said Tom, scarcely half com prehending what Edith said ; \" I've got no father \u2014 I never had one, for the matter of that, that I am aware of ; and as for mother, why perhaps yon may have heard what sort of an article the old gal is. So it seems to me, Miss Edith \u2014 I beg your pardon, Lady Edith\u2014 here we are, like the two babes in the wood ; and aU you've got to do is to say ' Tom Ripon, do this or do that,' and won't I do it neither I\" She spoke inquiringly, and shuddered as she spoke. \" Very dead, indeed !\" said Tom, scarcely know ing \u2122hat he repUed. \" Oh, come away \u2014 come away !\" \" Certainly,\" said Tom. \" But where to ?\" This was a question that had not occurred to E lith, and she scarcely knew how to answer it Tom Ripon saw that she was embarrassed ; and he thought that he would say the best thiBg he could under the circumstances. Edith pressed his hand between her own- \" If you never do me another service, Tom, in all your life, you've already done me one that I can never forget. Only see how strange it is that Jonathan WUd's horse has stood so still waiting our leisure.\" This was so, for the horse had never at tempted to move from the spot; and as for the steed that Edith had ridden, e.he had, in the midst of all the excitements and all the various feelings that had beset her on that eventful night, kept tbe bridle \u2014 probably unconsciously\u2014 for the greater part of the time around her arm. But still she knew not where to go. Tom tried to solve the question. \" It is not two miles to Epping Forest\" he said : \" perhaps the Captain is there stilL\" \" Yes,\" cried Edith, as she turned to tbe horse, \" I wiU seek him ; I wiU still follow tbe advice of Lady Castleneau \u2014 that advice so kindly and so wisely given, to teU him all. I cannot bear the life 1 am leading \u2014 itwUl kill me.\" Tom Bipon was stUl further confused and amazed by these words, and he could not possibly imagine for the life of him what had occurred be tween Felix Heron and Edith to produce the effect it had npon both their minds. During the ride from St James's Street to Epping Forest Tom had heard quite enough from the disjointed expressions and exclamations of Felix Heron to feel that there was something amiss. \" Anywhere, Lady Edith,\" he said ; \" I'm ready to go with you. Only say the word, and Tom's your man.\" \" No,\" replied Edith, with a deep sigh ; \" I forget.\" \" Forget, Lady Edith ? What have you for got?\" \" That I was now alone and desolate. Go back, Tom Bipon, to Felix Heron \u2014 to my husband, the E irl of Whitcombe. It is to him you owe duty and attachment Leave me to be saved or perish as pro vidence may dictate.\" \" If I do,\" said Tom, \" may I be hem ! WeU, I didn't mean to say that ; but we men some times can't help rapping out an expression or two that sounds a little strong. But if you think lhat you're all alone in the world, Lady Edith, you're wrong there \u2014 for there's me, Tom Bipon ; and I mean to stick to you throngh thick and thin, clear and smooth, and in all sorts of ways, and in aU sorts of lights \u2014 moonlight and daylight and candlelight\" \" Alas! \u2014 alas ! yon must not\" \" Yes, I must ; and I shall be the celebrated Tom Ripon ; for haven't I settled Jonathan Wild, that everybody's been trying to settle for ever so long, and nobody could ? There he lies ! Oh, good ness gracious 1 look there I\" \" What is it ?\u2014 what is it ?\" And now these sad and despairing words from Edith snffioienUy confirmed him in the supposi tion. Of one thing, however, he felt quite certain, and that was, that it would be very mnch to the happiness both of Edith and of Heron that they should speedUy meet \" Let's be off and away, Lady Edith,\" he said ; \" the Captain don't intend to stay in the forest I heard him say he meant to go to Blaokheath, and take np his quarters at some castle there that belongs to him.\" \" I ha^e heard him speak of it\" said Edith ; \"it is on Shooter's HiU.\" \"Look! No, don't look, it's too horrid. Yes, do look ; you'll think it something worse if yon don't.\" \" What >n the name of heaven, is it ? Edith and Tom now clung to each other more desperately than before ; and as they gazed upon the face of Jonathan WUd, which stood up so livid and haggard-looking from the ditch-water that curled around it, they saw a huge and hideous toad crawl over him, and perch npon his forehead. \" Yes, that's the place ; but he may not be gone yet and the horses will take us to the forest in a quarter of an hour \" Tom sprung to his saddle, and Edith had her foot on the stirrup, when a 6hout apprised her that he saw something apparently afar off in the It seemed to Edith that there was a terrific Uke ness between this reptUe and Jonathan Wild. It was a strange fancy of hers that there, as she tlnng to Tom Ripon, she and the brave spirit of"], [127, "EDITH HERON. 121 meadows which excited his curiosity and attracted his attention. upon them, she fell confident that it was Felix Heron she saw at their heaa, and tbat each moment his distance was increasing from her. And Tom Bipon likewise saw him and called out his name. \" What is it Tom ? Oh, what is it you see ? \"There! there!\" \" More danger ? Is there more danger ?\" \" No, no ! the Captain ! \u2014 the Captain and the band. There they go over the fields in the moon light, like so many ghosts !\" A cry of despair came from Edith's lips, and she mounted the horse, in order that by the ad ditional height gained in the saddle she might be able to see \u2014 as Tom saw \u2014 far over the meadows. The eyes of love and the eyes of youth were equally acute. They neither of them doubted for a moment that the foremost figure of tbat group of horsemen was the foremost person in both their thoughts. \"Felix! Felix!\" cried Edith, as she stretched forth her arms ; \"Felix! Felix! \u2014 only a moment and I will tell you all. The shadow that is upon our love and npon our lives shall pass away with that knowledge. Felix ! Felix I pause for a moment.\" The moonbeams lay broad and bright npon many a grassy slope and verdant level, tinting them with silver, and producing that strange blue hazy shadow incidental to the borrowed light of the fair luminary.

In the coach, then, which we have mentioned, and which rolled so smoothly aud so quietly over the loose, damp soU of the road, eat a lady and a gentleman. The horses, we have said, were sieek. The coachman was sleek. fleron and his band swept onward, and dis appeared from before their anxious gaze. \" Alone \u2014 alone \u2014 alone !\" she cried, and her head drooped to the mane of her horse. Tom was perplexed. At one moment he had thought his best plan wai to scramble with his horse over or through tbe hedge, and start off across the fields, in pursuit of F.-lix Heron. But then the idea of leaving Edith alone, or worse than alone, in that lane half hedge, haU road, with nothing but that hideous dead Jonathan Will to keep her company, stopped him short, and he could not go. But Edith's tears distressed Tom amazingly. \"Don't \u2014 don't!\" he said; \u2014 \"don't you take on in tbat way, Lady Edith ! It isn't a long way to i>l . okheoth, and we can easily go there ; only I don't think you're quite fit to go riding about the country at this time of night. And if we could only find somewhere for shelter, why, to-morrow might do as welL\" The footman was sleek. But eh ! what was the sleekness that they exhi bited in comparison to that of the lady and the gentleman within the coach. Contentment, peace, and serenity sat on both their countenances. Indeed, they seemed to be half-asleep, and to be regarding each other with a winking, blinking sort of serenity that was quite charming to see- Slow folks those. Edith felt \u2014 despite all her desire to seek out Heron at once, and tell him all \u2014 that she was quite unequal to a ride across the country to B ackheath. Decidedly slow. And ee happy ! But there was one great wonder in regard to them, and the horses, aud the coachman, and the footmaD, which may well strike tha reader. How came they all up and about in that narrow road to London at the imprudently early hour, for them, of half-past eight o'clock in tha morning ? Seldom was it that the gentleman \u2014 he was an old gentleman, and decidedly belonging to the \" old school\" as it is called, whatever that may mean\u2014 seldero, we say, was that gentleman down from his dressing-room until ten or eleven o'clock in the day. It was such a snug, cosy thing to take a morn ing nap. But there he was, and he must have been up an hour at least. \" You are right Tom,\" she said, faintly. \" I wiU go home now ; for I have a home, although I will not caU Whitcombe House by that dear name untU I am welcomed again across its threshold by FeUx. Come with me, and I will ensure you as kindly a welcome as wUl be ac corded to myself at Castfeneau House, tha resi dence of that dear relative who has never doubted me, and al ways loved me.\" CHAPTER XLIII. 'ONATHAN WILD IS HARD TO KILL, AND IS EVIDENTLY RESERVED FOB A SPECIAL FATE. And tho lady, too, fat, fair, and fifty-five ! She, too, was up at an hour which she had not seen for many a long year. Those were such truly sensible people that, hav ing nothing to do, particularly that night not to be done at any price, or not done at all, they never looked to see what the time was, when by chance a soft, half-extinguished ray of morning Ught came into their chamber. An old-fashioned family coach came lumbering along the half-road, half-lane, in which the ex ouing and singular adventure of Elith with Tom v ;_\u00abn and Jonathan WUd had taken place. It is early morning. The fair and beautiful moonlight has pasasd away, and the cold, grey Ught in the eastern sky has grown into brightness. The forest birds are singing and twittering in the hedges and on every tree. The owl and the bat have slunk into the dark recesses, where they shun the light of day. But all living creatures that love the bright sun and the soft air of dayUght are awake and abroad The coach we have mentioned was drawn by two sleek, well-fed horses. If they did not want to get up, they remained in bed. Blessed privilege ! If, when they did get up, because they felt in clined to do eo. and not before, and somebody said it was one o'elock, what cared they ? But here they were. Half asleep, as the coaoh, in a drowsy sort of way, on its great springs swayed to and fro. Like chUdren in a cradle. The coachman was sleek and well fed, too. The footman, who dozed in what was called a \" dickey \" at that period, but which now goes hy the name of a \"rumble,\" was as sleek and as suggestive of good living as the horses and the coachman. Bang! The report of a fowling-piece in the meadow, on the side of the road, roused them both. \" My dear,\" said the elderly gentleman. \" Yes, my love.\" \" Dear me, why cannot people let things alor>n and be quiet, and let other people be quiet I wonder if Augustus is up.\" \" No doubt, my dear. Ah, me !\" \"Amelia,\" added the old gentleman, after a pause, \" I am afraid Augustus is rather\u2014 rather In fact, it was quite a wonderfully well-to-do, comfortable-looking equipage altogether. A Uttle slow, perhaps. Decidedly slow for these railway days, when everybody seems to be in a hurry, and when everything is done in a hurry ; but a great deal more comfortable just on that account"], [129, "EDITH HERON. 123 \u00a3 what shall I say ? \u2014 inoUned to be restless and hur- IjEntr.\" Do you think it is on account of his being loosed up so early ?\" \"No, Sir John, no! It's a summat in tha hedge!\" \" But what's that to him ?\" \" Alas, yes !\" \" That was why you said ' Ah, me !' \" \" It was.\" \" I thought so ; and now, my dear, if you feel inclined to go to sleep again, I do.\" \" So do I.\" \" Nothing, Sir John ; but he won't go by it ! It's \u2014 it's a body I\" \"A what?\" Bang ! went the fowling-piece again. The old lady aud gentleman both looked up. They did not start They never started. Their nerves were in too good a condition for anything of that sort All they were capable of was, being disturbed by a noise. \" There he is again I\" said the old gentleman. \" Again,\" said the old lady. \" It's too bad.\" \"A corpus!\" \" Good gracious !\" Tbe old gentleman put his arm out at the window of the coach, and opening the door him self, he alighted with greater haste than he had ever exhibited in his life before ; except on one memorable occasion, when a restless ox, who would not \" take things easy and be quiet\" ran after him as he was passing Smithfield. It was Jonathan Wild in the ditch who had attracted the eyes of the horse on the near side of the carriage, and induced that usually staid and serious animal to walk on his hind legs in so eccentric a fashion. \" A great deal too bad.\" \" Well, my dear, since that troublesome man with the gun will neither let ns alone nor the birds. I may as well say to you that \u2014 that \" \" Yes, my love\" \" I hope it will be a fine day.\" \" So do I.\" \" A dead man in the ditch, Samuel ?\" \" Yes, Sir John. There he be !\" \" Somebody has been in trouble,\" said the foot- \" But if it don't I 'haU not care.\" \" Certainly not my love.\" \" Because, after all, what does it matter? Au gustus, our only son, this day is to be elected Lord Mayor of London ; and he made it a point \u2014 oh, dear ! oh, dear ! that anybody should make a point of anything but being quiet\u2014 he made it a point that we should get to London by eleven o'clock to meet him at the Mansion House '\u25a0\" man. \" Yes, and somebody's troubles are over, I fancy,\" remarked his master. \" No ! Yes ! Oh, no! Good gracious ! Look! \u2014 look!\" Jonathan Wild slowly raised one hand and arm, and tried to move the hand across his brow. Perhaps his impression was that tha toad sat there still, and perhaps he had, during that long and terrible night, been aware of the reptile's hideous presence and contact \" Why he's aUve !\" \" Yes, master, he is,\" said the coachman. \" We must get him out It's a trouble. Every thing is something of a trouble ; but it would be more trouble still, to think that wo had not behaved with common humanity to a fellow-creature !\" The coachman and footman never dreamt of disputing the orders of their indulgent master ; and perhaps they both thought exactly with him, that it was not worth while troubling their serene thoughts with an inhuman action. So Jonathan WUd was got out of the ditch. As the saying is, he was more dead than alive ; but the mysterious spark of vitality was there still in that ugly frame. It was a miracle that he was not shot by Tom Kipon. The bullet from the holster pistol had hit him on the corner of the left temple, just a Uttle to one side of his eye. The corner of the bone was a little shattered, but the bullet had deflected, and after running along half rottnd his head, ploughing up the scalp as it went, it had pursued its course harmlessly in the night air. But such an injury as that although cotnbined with such an escape, was not to be leceived with absolute impunity. The shock had produced insensibility, and so Wild had rolled into the ditch. \" Just so, my love.\" \"Ah, Amelia!\" \" Ah, John !\" \" I'm afraid Augustus will never leave off business as we did. I commenced with seven shillings in tha hosiery liue, and I said to myself, wheu I get ten thousand pounds I wUl retire.\" \" Yes, John.\" \" One morning I fonnd I had nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven pounds four and ten pence.\" \" Yes, John, I remember it\" \" A customer came in, and laid out two pounds fifteen and twopence.\" \"He did.\" \" And I soUowed him out and shut up the shep at once!\" \" To be sure ?\" \" And since then we have slept as long as we liked \u2014 got up when we Uked, and been peaceable and happy !\" Tha coach, at this moment, gave a decided lurch to one side. A stupendous circumstance had taken place. A something that had never occurred before, and was never expected to occur at aU. One of the sleek, well-fed horses was actuaUy standing on his hind legs. \" Woa! woa !\" said the coachman. \" Woa I woa !\" said the footman. \" Good gracious !\" said the old gentleman, the father of the new Lord Mayor that was to be '\u2022 Cannot that horse be quiet and take things easy ? What a trouble it must be to him to stand on his hind legs in that absurd way!\" If aoident had not then brought his face upper most, he would inavitably have been drowned. But that was not to be the fate oi Jonathan Wild. The coach gave another lurch. The horsa showed a disposition, which surely only some aberration of intellect cauld account tor, to walk along sideways on his hind legs. \"Woa I woa!\" He was doomed to be an illustration of the old saying, that \" he who is born to be hanged may bid defiance to any other fate.\" And Jonathan WUd was born to be hanged, as wiU be seen, towards the conclusion of this u_.ost veritable history. \"Woa! woa!\" \" What can it be ? Samuel, what can it be ?"], [130, "124 EDITH PERON. The warm sun fell upon the bank on the road side. It was the autumn of the year ; but still the early beams of morning had a life-giving essence in them, which in a great measure tended to revive Wild. \" Get to London, Sir John Cross, as quickly as I can.\" Sir John went to the side of the coach. \" Amelia, my dear!\" \" Yes, my love!\" \" I'm afraid we shaU have to do a disagreeable thing.\" \"What is it?\" He opened first one eye, and then the other. \" It's \u2014 it's \u2014 all over I \" he gasped. \" AU \u2014 all over, I suppose!\" \" What is over, my friend ? \" asked the old gentleman curiously. Wild had closed his eyes again. He oould not stani the sunlight \" What is all over, my friend?\" \" Ah, yes,\" murmured Wild ; \" he calls me his friend, and I have been his friend all my life. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! You ought not torment me much, for I have played into your hands, I am sure \u2014 quite sure \u2014 all my life \u2014 ail my life !\" \" What in the world does he mean, Samuel ?\" \" Can't you guess, Sir John ?\" Jonathan WUd began sniffing with his nose in a curious manner. \" Let the notorious Jonathan WUd ride with us to London ?\" \" Goodness me I\" \" No 1\" cried Wild, who overheard what 8tr John Cross said, and the reply of tbe lady. \" No, sir ; aU I ask is leave to sit on the roof of the coach. The air wUl do me good. That is aU I ask.\" \" Get up, then, in the name of heaven. Help him up, Samuel \u2014 help him no. I daresay the air wiU do him good, as he says. There \u2014 there ! I am thankful \u2014 oh! quite thankful \u2014 that I am not obliged to have him inside. Now, let ns get on, Samuel. To London ! To London ! Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! I'm afraid \u2014 I'm really very much afraid \" \" I fanoy,\" he moaned, \u2014 \" I fancy I ought to smell no end of brimstone, but I don't\" \" Why, as I Uve,\" said Sir John, \" he thinks himseU in the bad place I\" \" I shouldn't wonder, Sir John.\" \" Holloa ! Hoy I I say ! Whoever you are, don't be foolish I You are not there yet you know 1 Hoy ! Look up, man. You are in the world, or on the world, yet! Brimstone, indeed! What an idea! Let us hope that there is very little of that article to interfere with the sweet odours of heaven's mercy to all.\" \"Of what my love?\" \" My dear Amelia I'm afraid that for once in a way we shall actually have to be in a huny. \"Oh! oh! That is sad indeed!\" \" Very, but it can't be helped.\" CHAPTER XLV. Wild opened his eyes again. \" Where am I ?\" CAPTAIN HERON AND HIS RAND TAKE POSSES- SION OF SEVERNDROOG CASTLE ON SllOOIJIIt's HILL. \" On the road from Epping to London.\" \" And who are you ?\" \" Sir John Cross, late Alderman of Bassishaw Ward, and the father of the Lord Mayor that is to bs.\" And so Jonathan Wild was conveyed to the me tropolis in tolerable comfort, and at his own re quest put down at the corner of Newgate Street There, for the present we leave him. But before turning our attention to the pro ceedings of Captain Heron, it is necessary that we should, in as few words as possible, inform tbe reader how it was that Edith appeared in the out skirts of Epping Forest at so opportune a moment for Heron. Wild tried to scramble to his feet but the effort was too much for him ; he feU back again with a deep groan. \" The young rascal has very nearly done for me.\" \" What young rascal ?\" \" Oh, sir, I was set npon by highwaymen last night in this lane or wood, and cruelly treated. They, no doubt, left me for dead; and dead I might have been, but for your worship's kind help.\" \" WeU, and who may yon be?\" WUd was rapidly recovering the use of his mind and memory, although he was too weak, and his Umbs were too benumbed by their long immersion in the ditch-water, to enable him to stand. We left her with Lady Castleneau on the last occasion that in her own proper feminine costume, we saw her, with the tears of sensibUity upon her face. The more she reflected npon the advice which her aunt had given her to teU to Felix Heron the whole of the circumstances oonnected with her brother, the villanous John Tarleton, the more she felt convinced of the soundness of the counsel. Deeply and bitterly she blamed herself for not on the first intimation from John Tarleton of who and what he was, making Felix thoroughly ac quainted with his visit and his threats. This was a decided error \u2014 this secrecy and this attempt to get rid of such a man as John Tarleton with anything like safety and ease. It was the one error of the spotless life of poor Edith. \" Sir,\" he said, \" I wonder you don't know me.\" \u2022' WeU, I don't\" \" All the City authorities know me well.\" \" But I have retired, and don't know you, so tell me yonr name.\" \" Jonathan WUd !\" The old gentleman started back. \" What I The infamous Jonathan WUd ?\" \" Sir, I only do my duty.\" \" I am sorry that I\u2014 no, no \u2014 I won't say that I won't \u2014 I'm glad that I puUed you out of the ditch, very glad ; but yet \u2014 yet, U you had only stayed there \u2014 if the horse had not stood on his hind legs \u2014 if, if WeU, weU, we wUl say no more about it If you were ten times what you are, my duty was quite plain before me. And now, Mr. Jonathan Wild, what do you propose to do ?\" Oh, how bitterly she suffered for it. What pangs it cost her ! But surely now that suffering would all be over. Felix Heron was not the person to refuse to listen to any one who might come to him with a confes sion of error and a petition for pardon. And last of aU would he turn a cold or a deal ear to such an appeal from Edith ! His own dear, much-loved Edith !"], [131, "125 EDITH HERON. A feeling of contentment, amounting almost to positive happiness, came over her as the carriage rapidly took her to Whitcombe House. And yet she thought the progress tardy, and she could have got out if she had consulted her own feeUngs, and gladly ran the distance- But at length she was there. She stood upon the threshold of the door. It was flung open. There were two strange men in the halL \" The Earl ! the Earl !\" she said. \" Where is the Earl?\" of difficulty, at least to lift from his mind this most oppressive weight of all, by dissipating the idea that she was otherwise than as true to him as she had ever been and ever would be. With this impulse aud these feelings, she would ask no questions of the men in the hall. Her only dread was that they wonld impede her progress up the grand staircase to her own apart ments. It was with faltering and hesitating steps thal> she tried the experiment whether they intended to let her pass or not, and her relief was propor tionately great when she found herself unim peded. She flew up that staircase like some beautiful vision of light, nor paused until, panting and almost breathless with the speed she had made, she found herself on the first floor of the bouse. \" We only wish we knew, ma'am,\" said one of the men in a surly tone. \" He has managed to give ns the slip ; but mayhap, ma'am, you may know where he is better than you would like to make out you do.\" \" What insolence is this ?\" \" Oh, ma'am, we does'nt mean to be uncivU ; but if you can put us in the way of nabbing him, we shall be mightily obliged, that we shaU.\" Edith stood panic-striken. What could all this mean ? Then she ventured, in a subdued tone, to call upon Felix. She thought, however subdued that tone might be, he would recognise it as hers, and, if he were secreted anywhere, would quickly make his ap pearance ; and then \u2014 oh, then, what joy it would be for her, in a few words, at once to explain al! to him, and to feel that she was restored to tha throne of his affections. None of the servants of the house were to be seen : the hall, with all its magnificence, in the possession of strange men, who spoke in so dis respectful a fashion of the Earl of Whitcombe, in whose presence they would surely have stood abashed ! \" Felix ! Felix ! it is I ! It is your Edith ! Felix ! Felix ! it is I who caU upon you !\" She feared to raise her voice much above a whisper, lest those men who occupied a position in tbe hall adverse tc his happiness and safety, might hear her. Tho house was very silent Most of the servants had fled, taking with them what they conld, for they had been assured by the officers that the career of the Earl of Whitcombe was over, and that he would never inhabit that house more- What had occurred ? What terrible mystery was hidden beneath aU this surface of anxiety and dread? She feared to ask further questions\u2014 not from fear in the ordinary acceptation of the word, but because she dreaded that tbe answer might add one more drop to the cup of bitterness which was already so nearly full. She began to doubt whether she would be permitted even to cross the hall of that honse, which she had been accustomed to call her own. Hence that briUiant and beautiful residence \u2014 which had so lately been such a scene of anima tion and gaiety, thronged with servitors and dis pensing hospitalities with a liberality rarely to be fnund \u2014 seemed fearfuUy desolate, and cold, and still. But there was no hindrance on that score- The orders of the officers were not to allow ary one to leave Whitcombe House, with any of its vauable contents or properties, so far as they could observe ; and certainly to arrest Fe!ix Heron, \u25a0hould he attempt to enter it. But there was nothing iu the circumstances which could make it necessary to refuse admission to the Countess of Whitcombe, whom they at once shrewdly suspected this fine lady to be. \" Do you not know me ?\" she said ; \" and are you aware that this is the house of the Earl of Whit combe, and that I am his wUe?\" Once more, notwithstanding all its new and superb decorations, Whitcombe House seemed to be abandoned to the memory and the mystery of the dead. Edith advanced some distance along the oor ridor, and, glancing into one of the drawing rooms, where a single wax candle, burning low in its socket of the chandelier, shed a faint lustre about it, she again called upon Felix. But there was no response. He was surely gone. But whither ? \u2014 oh, whither ? Whither had be flown, with that desolate feeling at his heart that she, in word, look, thought, or action was false to him? \" We don't want no wives, ma'am : it's the Earl himself we wait for \u2014 the Earl of Whitcombe, aliat Felix Heron, the highwayman of Epping Forest.\" Edith shrunk in terror from these words. There was a ribald kind of familiarity iu which they were uttered, which made her feel some dangerous change had taken place in the fortunes of Felix, even during the few short hours she had been absent from him. How precious now to her seemed the moments she had let slip away, during which she had had it in her power, by the utterance of a few words, to dispel at once the melancholy and terrible de lusion under which he had laboured in regard to her But yet she conld not divest herself of that idea that he must be somewhere in the house. It was a large mansion, with many places of concealment and some mysteries of construction, as she well knew, both from what had been told her by Heron at different times, and from the mysterious facUity with which John Tarleton, her brother, had found his way to what she called her own apartments. He was gone. Where should she look for him ? What thoughts had he taken with him concern ing her ? These were terrible questions. But suddenly a new hope sprung up in Edith's bosom. If some danger, then, had approached her Felix, might he not still be somewhere in that mansion ? And if so, surely her voice would reach him ; and she might be able, in those moments of danger and She had neared the door leading to her own suite of apartments, and she felt certain that sh?"], [132, "126 EDITH HERON, heard some hlight noise within them, suggestive of some human presence. Was it her Felix ? It surely must be. Who else could be there at such a time ? A bright flush came over the countenance of Edith. She hesitated not a moment longer. She felt like one who had been long condemned to shadow and to darkness, and who, at the first opportunity, rushes into the sunUght as the most precious gift of nature. The door yielded to her touch in a moment and she was in har own apartments. \" Felix ! Felix ! you are here ! \u2014 you are here ! It is I, and I am your Edith 6tUl !\" These words were echoed by a sli_rht scream, and disappointment immediately sat Uke a cloud upon Edith's face. There was some one there, but it was not Felix Heron. was known ; and master rode away upon _. ?o black horse tbat they call Daisy, aud that he used to go to see every day in the stable, and feed with all sorts of nico things, that I'm sure a Christian might have been glad to have ; and that's about aU I know of it.\" Edith clasped her hands together despairingly. \" You know that he is gone,\" she said ; \"and I know that he is gone; but whither \u2014 oh, whither?\" \" Well, my lady, perhaps you may know, though I don't from something that horrid little beast of a boy, Tom Ripon, said. I heard it as plain as possible-\" \" What\u2014 what said he?\" \" 'Off to the forest ' \u2014 that was what he said ; and what forest he meant, I don't know. There's Mr. Forest the hairdresser, round the corner, and a very sweet young man he's got in his shop.\" Edith felt convinced she had all the information she was likely to obtain from this woman, and her only anxiety now was to get rid of her. She opened the door of the room, and, looking at her calmly and fixedly, she said, \" You have lobbed me; and, for all I know, that may be only one of yonr offences in this bouse ; but I have said that you should go in peace, and I wUl keep my word. Gol\" There was that in the tone and the manner of Edith which the waiting-maid could not resist She said not a word, but passed out of the room ; and, in a few seconds more, she had left Whitr combe House for ever. The waiting-maid\u2014 who had made so infamous a compact with Le Jeune, and who had been so ready to back up, with her statements, the false hoods Le had uttered to his gracious and unsus pecting master, the Earl of Whitcombe, concern ing his whereabouts on that night when Heron could have sworn he had heard his voiee on Shooter's HU1 \u2014 was there. What she was about was perceptible in a moment ; and had it not been so by her acts, the guilty confusion upon her face would have pro claimed it She was ransacking Edith's drawers, and cabi nets, and wardrobes, and making np into as port able a parcel as she could their most valuable contents. But she took with her au amount of plunder that she felt certain would make ber \u2014 for a time, at least so long os it lasted \u2014 exceedingly wel come to the villain Le Jeune, whose haunts she knew quite well, and therefore whom sho would have no difficulty in joining. Poor Edith did not feel herself quite so much alone now that she was iu reality entirely so in those rooms, as when that unprincipled woman infested them with ber presence. But what was she to do ? At sight of Edith, and at tha one look which the Countess cast upon her \u2014 which look was quite sufficiently expressive of the fact that she wss de fected\u2014this ungrateful abt'gaU made an attempt to rush past Edith and leave the room. But Edith restrained her, and closed tbe door. \" No,\" she said ; \" I have not been without my suspicions that you were a faithless servant; but I am willing to forgive aU the past and to say to you 'Go in peace,' on condition that you inform me what has happened iu this house during the last two hours.\" Her mind was a complete chaos of conflicting thoughts and feelings. If she had but reached Whitcombe House one hour earlier, what a world of misery might she not have saved herself and Felix Heron ! This was too good an offer to be resisted, and tho more especially considering that the waiting maid had in her pockets a number of little port able articles of value, which she hoped to be able to cany unsuspected with her when she went in peace. But still, in the mi<l;t of all tbe confusion of her mind, and all the agony she suffered at his absence, one thought was uppermost, one natural idea that superseded aU others. It was to follow him\u2014 to search him out \u2014 to hasten upon his track, let him be where he might ; and, at the first moment that she could come into his presence, to cling to him with the energy of love and of despair, and declare to him the whole truth. \" Oh, my lady \u2014 indeed, my lady, I did not, mean \u2014 you \u2014 you think quite wrong of me. I was only putting the things to rights, because \u2014 bs cause \u2014 I thought \u2014 that as I was led to believe, my lady, that you would be leaving Whitcombe House \" \" Say no more. I do not wish to hear of that. Answer me \u2014 What has happened here ; and what has become of the Earl of Whitcombe ?\" That was a natural course for her to pursue. What else had she to do in \u00bbU the world \u2014 for what was all the world to her without Fel x Heron ? The waiting-maid at once became self-possessed and important ; her fears nearly forsook her, and she spoke muoh mere confidently. \"Why, my lady, the young Earl of Bridgewater came here; and I was passing tbe door of the green drawing-room quite accidentally, when I heard him teU his lordship, my master, that there was something amiss, and a warrant or something of that sort was out against him ; and then, my .fc^T, there came a coach to the door, and quite a fine gentleman, with some constables, came in ; and then there was such a disturbance as never And soon that dominant idea reigned alone, and she had but to ask herself how it was to be ac complished. Those words which the waiting-maid had heard from Tom Ripon seemed to ring in her ears. \" To the forest ! To the forest 1\" It was amid the leafy glades of old Epping that she was to seek Felix Heron. If she had not had those words reported to her, her own re flection would have told her that it was there ho would fly for safety, for succour, and for com panionship."], [133, "EDITH HERON. 127 But n. w there could bo no doubt of it In some of those sweet glades, beneath the greenwood tree, she was to meet with him ; and there, where they had so often communed in peace and happiness, she would be able to tell him the story of John Tarleton, and of how that vow of vengeance he, Felix, had registered in heaven against the mur derer of his father had so soon recoiled upon him self, and been productive of an amount of unhappi ness which no other circumstance in the wide world could have produced. A hasty glance showed her that they were charged. But still there was the difficulty abont the horse and tha mode of leaving; Whitcombe House. Edith was standing close to the oabinet from which she had taken the pistols, and they were both lying in her left hand, whan she was s:artled by a strange noise, apparently behind the wain scoting of the room. It was a creeping, rumbling sort of sound, whioh seemed to traverse about one half the length of the apartment and then to pass away into the adjoin ing room. This sound was followed by one of a much sharper character, which came distinctly from the other apartment ; and then it flashed into Edith's mind suddenly that there were exactly the pre monitory sounds which had indicated the approach cf John Tarleton when last he visited her in those rooms, and extorted from her a considerable sum of money on the promise that, at least for a lengthened period, he would leave her in peace. Edith turned pale as death itself. Was that terrible incubus upon her young life coming again, even at that moment of anxiety and grief, to oppress her ? Could it be possible that he had got through the Is.rge sum with which she had heedlessly and unhappily furnished him, and was coming again with taunts and with raprosches to prey upon what bad b.en the weakness of her feelings and sensibilities ? Edith reflected upon these things as she stood amid the confusion of her wardrobe as it had been ransacked by her waiting-maid. One bundle, corded and sealed, met her eyes. She knew its contents, and the sight of it sug gested at once a course of action to pursue. In that bundle was a complete costume of a gentleman highwayman, or knight of the road, which she had worn npon more than one occasien, when her fears for the safety of Felix Heron had induced her to sally forth from the secure haunts in the depths of Epping Forest to watch over and assist him in the hour of need. What more appropriate time than the present for such a costume ? It would bestow upon her every safety on her route to Epping. She need not be aggressive, though she wore it; and interfering with no one, it would stiU be to her a protection, for no one would think of interfering with her : while in her feminine costume she might encounter a thousand disasters, and be impeded by any ono and every one who chose to consider her appearance, alone and unprotected, a singular circumstance. These thoughts and suggestions brought with them a determination to carry them out; and Edith, in the course of another quarter of an hour, was fully equipped, presenting that charming spectacle of apparent incipient manhood in her youth and beauty, which so well became the cos tume she wore. But Edith quite forgot a very important cir cumstance. She was intently listening to those sounds which might be indicative of the approach of John Tarleton, and in doing so. she quite forgot the great change she had just effected in her per sonal appearance. But there were difficulties yet to be overcome. She must have a horse. CHAPTER XLVI. And sue mnst find a means of quitting that house, if it were possible to do so, without passing through the hall , for it was not likely that the two officers there on duty would aUow any one pre senting her appearance to leave the house un questioned. Nay, ihey might take it into their headi that in her they saw the veritable Captain Heron himself, and she might be detained for on indefinite period. Or, what would be as bad, she might be fol lowed. JOHN TARLETON IS ALARMED IN HIS TURN, AND EDITH F1-.D3 A MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM WHITCOMBE HOUSE. It would be no longer the shrinking, trembling Countess of Whitcombe that John Tarleton would have to encounter ; but as far as his eyes might serve him in the dim light of that room, he would see a man. A man, too, who by his dress and appointments would not appear at all the sort of person likely to be imposed upon by him, or to submit to any of hi* exactions. A feeling of despair now came over Edith, for she did not see at once how to get over this diffi culty. This Edith forgot at tbe moment She only recollected who she really was, and how much she had suffered consequently upon the two terrible visits which John Tarleton had already paid to those apartments. To tell the truth, she was very little acquainted with the internal economy of Whitcombe House, and that duU back staircase, by which FeUx him self made his escape towards the stables, was scarcely known to her. \" Heaven help me!\" she cried ; \" and inspire me with some happy thought which shall speed me on my path towards Felix and happiness.\" From a drawer in one of her cabinets \u2014 which had certainly not escaped the scrutiny of the wait ing-maid, but the contents of which she had left alone, probably because they alarmed her \u2014 Edith procured the smaU pair of silver-mounted pistols which Felix Heron had long since given to her in the forest and at the same time so perfectly in straded her in the use of. And so, looking like a startled hare who hears the sound of the hunters on the gale, she listened to the indications of the approach of that arch enemy of her peace, who should have been the first to stand up in her defence and be mindful of her happiness. Yes, it must be him. She heaid his footsteps. The swaggering, easy gait of a man who felt that he could make himself at home, as much as though he were loved, because he was feared. The door was slung open\u2014 that door of commu nication between the two rooms; and John Tar"], [134, "128 EDITH HERON. leton, iu a rich dress \u2014 soiled however, and dirty with neglect and torn here and there in places, from various brawls he had been engaged in \u2014 made his appearance. It was evident that if ever any courage had belonged to tbat bad spirit, a long career of vice and infamy had submerged it in a sea of cowardice. At the first glance, he did not seem to see that there was any one in the apartment to which he thus made his way with such ease and freedom, hut he called out in a voice whioh showed that, although not quite intoxicated, he had made suffi ciently free with the wine-cup to divest him of all care or caution. He cried aloud for mercy ; and stUl he made his way towards the secret recess in the wall from which he had come, so fuU of vaunting, and boast ing, and defiance, to oppress a woman. Because that woman was a wife. Because that woman was a sister. And because her mind was made up of Sue humanities and gentle feelings which were likely to be played easily npon by such a man as he. But, now, he showed himself the abject wretch he was \u2014 without honour \u2014 without faith \u2014 without courage, or one constancy of purpose, except in iniqnity. \" Mercy ! Oh, don't \u2014 don't shoot again ! Oh, my lord, don't fire I Have mercy on a poor devil ! I won't come here any more \u2014 Indeed I won't! On roy soul, I won't ! Only let me go this time! ' \" Go !\" said E lith, in a deep, assumed voice. \"Yes, yes, my good lord, I'm going! Biess you, I'm off! Don't fire again! You might hita fellow ! Oh, don't ! I'm off\u2014 off \u2014off\u2014 off I\" \"What ho, Edith! sister of mine! \u2014 fair Countess, revelling in jewels and in wealth \u2014 your pensioner, the elegant, the facetious, and the admired John Tarleton, calls upon you!

Money \u2014 money, fair sister of mine\u2014 I must have money ! Hand itout and with no niggard hand, or I'll tell you what I'll do ! I'll draw a bill, and put the name of your noble husband to it; and then Ah ! the dtvil! Who's this?\" Edith then turned slowly towards him, and uttered but one word \u2014 \"Villain!\" John Tarleton reached the narrow secret door iu the panel. His baste to escape was by far too great to permit him to pause for a single in stant to close it after he had scrambled through it John T_rleton was so utterly confounded at the sight of what he thought was Captain Heron him self, that for a few seconds he stood like a man petrified. He could neither move nor speak ; and Edith, who was in too great a state of flurry and alarm at his presence to recoUect her raasculite costume, was not a little surprised at the consternation which betrayed itself in the face and attitude of John Tarleton. He fanc_d that he could hear the avenging footsteps of the Earl of Whitcombe behind him, to whom he did not doubt now that Edith had told everything. His game of spoliation, and terror, and rasoality in that house he felt to be over. The deathlike stillness between them lasted while one, with moderate haste, might have counted twenty, and then John Tarleton, thoroughly sobered by fright, cried out, \"Perdition! it is the E irl himself, and I am done !\" One never to be resumed again. What matter then was it to him who knew of the secret mode by which he had made Lis way into the lordly and costly mansion ? With a few last cries, deprecatory of the anti cipated vengeance of the supposed Earl of Whit combe, John Tarleton made his way through the narrow opening in the wall. \" Don't fire after me, my lord, \u2014 don't ! Ou my sacred word, I promise never to set foot in this house again ! Only let me go this time, and it is the last ! I won't even mention tbe name of Edith! Don't fire \u2014 don't ki.l me! Have some mercy on a poor fellow\u2014 a poor devil \u2014 do \u2014 do !\" The voice of John Tarleton died eff in the dis tance. He turned and tried to fly, but his feet got en tangled in his sword, and he fell. The few words he uttered, at last, however restored Edith perfectly to herself, and she then knew what it was that had produced such a re vulsion of feeling in the mind of her unscrupulous brother. Edith's intellect was of much too fine a texture for her not to see instantly what advantage she might gain by this mistake on the part of John Tarleton. There was an opportunity which might rid her of his importunities for ever. He had, in a loud voice, proclaimed who and what he was, and what he came for ; and he evidently supposed tbat those words had found their way to the ears of Felix Heron. To keep him under that delusion \u2014 to thoroughly alarm him with the consciousness that the Earl of Whitcombe now knew all \u2014 that his existence, and the spirit of his exactions were no longer secrets \u2014 appeared to Edith a state of things which, if she could produce and perpetuate, was much to be desired. It died off, too, with a very appropriate word. If ever there was a fiend in human shape, it surely must be the man who would attempt, as he had done, to convert the purest hest, and holiest impulses of human nature into his owu profit, without a thought or oare of the ruin that he might produce. S ach a fiend was John Tarleton. But there is no such thing as unmixed evil iu this strange world of contradictions. The visit of John Tarleton was a positive service to Edith. Of service in two ways. In the first place, it so terrified him, that it was more than probable he really wonld never again make his appearance in Whitcombe House. In the next place, it pointed out to her tha means of escape, attired as she was, from the mansion, without the necessity cf encountering the two constables in the hall In a tithe of the time it has taken to record, this train of thought ran throngh the mind of Edith. She said not a word, but transferring one of the pistols from her left hand to her right, &he levelled it \u2014 not oi! John Tarleton, but some four or five feet above his head, as he lay entangled by his sword, and she fired it John Tarleton uttered a yell of fear. He scrambled onwards in the most abji ct manner upon his hands and knees. Surely that was something ! And what was more still \u2014 of more conse quence than aU\u2014 the route which John Tarleton"], [135, "129 EDITH JIEROy, Ifl this way unconsciously pointed ont to Edith led directly to the stables of Whitcombe House. It was a certainty that there would bo found horses in that stable. Edith only now waited loDg enough to allow John Tarleton's fright to carry him quickly away from Whitcombe House, and then she stepped to wards the panel in the wall. She was not an instant too soon. Indeed, Edith hoped and had a fair expectation that she should there find one horse in particular, which, although far from possessing the qualifica tions or the rare instincts of Daisy, was still a steed upon which she could depend. If she could but once feel that she had posses sion of that horse, she felt certain that she might soon make her way to Epping Forest. And then \u2014 then \u2014 oh, happy thought! \u2014 then what could hinder her from at once explaining all the past to Felix Heron ? How happy might they stiU be beneath the deep and beautiful shadows of the old wood ! What a blissful time might come \u2014 a time stUl more sunny and still more beautiful, if that were possible, than any that had passed away ! .\u25a0\u00bb No. 17.\u2014 Edith Hebon. The report of the pistol shot by which she had 60 terrified her iniquitous brother had naturally enough found echoes throughout the whole of Whitcombe House. The two officers in the hall had heard it That it was in some way associated with the Earl of Whitcombe and his escape they believed, but they dared not leave their posts. After a short discussion, however, they com promised the matter by one of them remaining in the hall, whUe the other ran up the grand stair case in the direction whence the sound of the pistol-shot had come, with the view of ascertaining its cause. Just then, as Edith was about to leave by the"], [136, "EDITH HERON. 130 A gleam of light came through a narrow taU opening in the wall. A door had partially opened. The odour of hay and straw camo upon her secret way that suite of rooms, the offi;or rattled at the look of the door of the first one. It was well that Edith, after the departure of the treacherous waiting-maid, had taken the precau tion to lock the door. Had she not done so, she could scarcely have escaped the observation of the constable. As it was, however, she was safe. Before the door could be forced\u2014 and the con stable, in such a great, grand house, . rather hesi tated about adopting such a course upon his own authority\u2014 Edith was gone. She closed the tall, narrow panel after her. It shut with a spring lock, which perhaps it would have been wise and well for Edith to have made herself thoroughly acquainted with ; but at that time of excitement and haste she did not pause to do so. senses. She had reached the stables of Whitcombe House. But at the same time that she made that dis covery, she heard the sound of voices. A most welcome sound under the circumstances. \" Well, Joe,\" said one voice, \" I don't pretend to understand it all, but they may say what they like about Lord Whitcombe, be is a good master, and is right down kind to the 'osses.\" \" So he is,\" replied the other voice\u2014\" so he is, Tummas ; but did you ever see sich a real beauty as the Countess?\" \" No, I never did.\" \" Nor me.\" Edith, from the voices, guessed that the persons who were thus confidentially giving their opinion of their master and mistress were two stable-boys, who were employed occasionally as outriders. She had no fear of them, but yet she did not feel at all inclined to trust them with the secret of who and what she was. She was only too happy to have found suoh a mode of egress from Whitcombe House. The passage in which she found herself was narrow, because it was only constructed in the thickness of the wall. There conld he no doubt but that it was by this route that the late Earl of Whitcombe, the father of Felix Heron, entered and left the manBionin whioh he kept at one time such princely state- During that long period when remorse for the past \u00bbnd a hope of achieving something to atone for the evil that his life had produced, had kept him in secrecy and in seclusion, the late Earl had adopted this weU-known to him mode of making use of his house, without disturbing the regular front entrance. Time was pressing too, and Edith was eager to be gone as soon as possible There was no resource but to give these two boys something of a fright. She wondered how it was they were so com posed aft. r John Tarleton had surely passed that way ; but Edith was not aware that he had juot avoided them by a few moments of time. Feeling in the pocket of the scarlet coat she wore, Edith found the half-mask again, whichshe had placed there To put it on, and then to push open the seoret door, were her next two actions. Then she found tbat the door opened into a little harness room, which was not positively the room in whioh the two boys were, although it was tha next one to it. Edith felt a kind of reverence for tha dusty floor on which she trod, in the recollection that the foetsteps of her Felix's father had likewise often trodden it But then she recollected that the route had like wise been the one which her bad brother, John Tarleton, had found convenient as that which he could come to persecute her. That was a desecration. So Edith hurried on until she stumbled, and very nearly fell down a narrow flight of steps. That accident, avoided so narrowly, taught her more caution, and she felt her way caielully as she proceeded. The steps were steep and numerous, and she felt certain that they had conducted her quite to the level of the ground floor of Whitcombe House. Under these circumstances, Edith fonnd she still possessed the opportunity of keeping that mode of ingress into Whi'-combo House a secret- She resolved to do so. To be sure, John Tarleton knew cf it by some means. But would not his fears keep him from ever again setting foot in that place ? Edith thought they would. The voices of the two boys were now quite plain, and they were still giving their opinions on tbe Uberality of Heron and the beauty of Edith, when she stepped before them. Snch an appearance in the stable, so utterly un expected, and coming from they knew not where, struck the two boys with all the terror of an apparition. Then there was a continuation of the narrow passage for about thirty paces, when it abruptly ended, and Edith could not find any lateral route to the rig ht or to the left. This ending, then, of the narrow passage must be the way out. That is to say, there must be some door, which she must find the way to open. Carefully she felt the wall with both bands. It was of wood, and damp to the touch ; but Edith soon found a smaU bolt which she was much more surprised to find shot into its socket so as to hold the panel door with which it no donbt communi cated shut, than she was to find it there actually. This mystery was, however, soon explained. Edith found, by a careful manipnlaiion of the bolt that it was acted upon like a latoh by a spring, so that even if pulled back, it had a ten dency to close its If when released. No donbt on the other side there was some means by which the spring of the bolt conld be acted upon. Edith then drew the spring bolt back. They both rolled over each other in their haste and anxiety to get out of tho way ; and Edith found that it was not necessary to say a single word to them. She had the stable wholly to herself, to do what she pleased with any of the horses in it The horse she had hoped to get possession of was there, and now Edith was glad indeed that she had acquired the art of equipping a horse with saddle and bridle. It was not one of those arts which usually go towards the making up the accomplishments of a young lady; but then Edith knew a great many things that were rather out-of-the-way pieces of knowledge, and evidently useful on that account In five minutes' time she was mounted, and"], [137, "EDITH HERON, 131 had mada her way out of the stable without any hindrance. his right making the distance somewhere about seventeen or eighteen miles in all The night, then, was tolerably far advanced before Heron and his band actually debouched upon the large expanse of Blackheath. The moon, too, bad disappeared behind dense masses of clouds, so that the cavernous darkness of the heath was excessive. A cool and pleasant air, however, from the south-west, blew over the large waste track \u2014 a much larger space than now, when villas, and, in some cases, almost streets, have crept over the confines of the heath. W hat Edith then did on the outskirts of Epping Forest towards saving Felix Heron from the hos tility of Jonathan Wild and the strong party of horseman he had with him, we are already weU aware, as well as how Tom Ripon succeeded in baffling Wild's vUlany. CHAPTER SLVII. FELIX HERON TAKES POSSESSION OF THE CASTLE ON SHOOTER'S HILL, AND MAKES HIS AK- P.ANOEMENTS FOR A NEW LIBE ON THE ROAD. \" Halt !\" said Heron. The band came to a standstill. \" Follow me and Ogle, now, at as quiet a pace as you can. I have some reason to suppose that the castle which I intend should be our head quarters is already occupied ; and if so, it wiU be an object to take prisoner the person or persons who may be there\" Captain Heron now moved on, but at a slow pace. The horses' feet on the soft, thick, yielding turf of the heath scarcely made any sound ; and the darkness was so great that the whole party looked like some moving shadows making way across the heath, and only a little blacker than the surrounding air through which they passed. Ogle rode close now to Captain Heron, and the latter spoke to him in low tones. \" Ogle, do you think Tom Ripon is in any danger?\" \" None in the least.\" How sad was this estrangement between Felix Heron and Edith I What powerful consequences sprung from it I And by what a seeming malevolent chance was poor Edith prevented from carrying out her in tention of at once communicating to Heron her mysterious secret in regard to John Tarleton ! Little did he, Heron, suppose that at the time he with his hand swept over the meadows, on his route towards Blackheath across the country, that in that fair moonlight he was actually within sight of his Edith. And still less did he imagine \u2014 for it would have driven him to the brink of distraction could he so have imagined it \u2014 that Edith had even for a parsing minute been in the power of Jonathan Wild. But these things were to be. The inscrutable designs cf Providenoe decreed that -hese two fond and faithful hearts should be separated for a time. \" I am right glad to hear you say 60.\" \" Oh, Captain, you may always depend upon it that Tom wiU get into no scrape by ill luck, or by heedlessness, that he will not get out of again by courage and cunning.\" \" I thiuk so too. He will probably join us in the morning, for he is aware that we were about to change our quarters to this place.\" \" Quite aware of it Cap ain.\" \"Look, Ogle! \u2014 you may see the tower and turret of the castle on the hill right before you, now.\" And so separated they were. We now foUow Captain Heron and his band to their new destination. That destination was the castle on Shooter's HiU, whither ha had declared his intention of going. Felix Heron considered that he had a right to take up his quaiters in that place, since it truly formed a portion of the Whitcombe property. But he was by no means unmindful of the fact that it had been, and possibly was, still the haunt of Lord Warringdale, who, in his character of the \" White Highwayman,\" had had tha assurance to take possession of it No doubt Warringdale was as weU aware as Felix Heron that tne costie was part of the Whit combe property, but it remained to be seen if he oould held it against Felix Heron. Indeed, after the scene that had taken place be tween Heron and Warringdale on Blackheath, the latter had begun to think that Severndroog Castle was anything but a safe place for him. And he was right. But he certainly had no notion that Heron and his band from Epping Forest were likely so soon to make their appearance in that locality. If he had had such an idea, it was not in the neigh bourhood of Blackheath that Lord Warringdale would have been found. The distance across the country from Epping Forest to Blackheath was something considerable, when the nature of the country is considered, and that tha Thames would have to be crossed. That could not be done, of course, lower down than London Bridge. The consequence was, that although Heron, on leaving Epping, made his way across the country in the moonUght he was compelled to diverge to \" I do see it\" \"Tis but a gloomy place\u2014 built in a whim of an ancestor of the Whitcombes ; but I feel im pelled by at least one strong reason to take pos session of it\" \" What is that, Captain ?\" \"I hardly know how to tell you, for you wiU say at once that it is a dream lam relating to you ; although, to me, apart from the mystery sur rounding the circumstances which baffles me to unravel, it has aU the semblance of a stern reality.\" \" Captain, let me hear it \" \" Then, Ogle, in that castle whither we are bound, and where I propose that you and I and our associates who now follow us, t-gether with Tom Ripon, when he returns, should find a refuge and a home, I have heard the voice of one who \u2014 who \" Heron paused ; his feeUngs for the moment over came him. \" The voice of one who has behaved,\" said Ogle, \" as badly to you as he can, Captain. You mean your half-brother ?\" \" No, no ; I did not allude to him \u2014 although in truth, I have heard his voice there But it w< another voice that I would give half my life ' hear, whsle I held the hand of the person to w,J1 it belonged fairly in mine.\""], [138, "132 EDITH HERON. \"Ab, Captain! can it be possible that this Amelia Staunton I have heard you speak of is there?\" children wherever you may choose to lead them ; and it belongs, too, in part to one whose nanio you have forbidden me to mention, but who, ior all that should never be forgotten.\" Ogle pronounced these words in a tone and with a manner that made a great impression npon Heron. \" My poor mother !\" \" Then, in the name of heaven, Captain, let ns push on as quiokly as we can !\" \" No, no ! I fear it was but a delusion of the overwrought brain, Ogle ; and you wiU think so, too, when I tell you aU.\" Ogle now listened to Felix Heron's relation with the greatest anxiety and interest while he, Heron, informed him of the more than singular adventure which had befallen him in the chamber of the castle on the occasion of his former visit to it Could he possibly be insensible to them ? Probably, from a less honest heart than that which he knew to beat in the breast of Ogle, Captain Heron could scarcely have endured these allusions to circumstances which, although he himself never forgot, might well be supposed to be productive of infinite pain when spoken of by others He could not trust his voice to speak for a few seconds. But the effect upon Ogle's mind was just what Heron had anticipated. \"Ah, Captain!\" he said, \u2014 \"you must have dropped, from sheer fatigue, into a doze.\" \"Just so.\" \" Ogle,\" he then said, \" you are right.\" \" I'm glad to hear you say so, Captain, for you wUl now let me go with you?\" \" You shall, Ogle ; and what is more, I do not see any difficulty in bringing the whole of the band into the plantations ol the castle.\" \" None in the least Captain.\" \" Let each man dismount then, and lead his horse up the steep ascent of the hill: it will be a quieter proceeding than riding up. I will take the lead; and if there be an enemy in this old castle, who, as I suspect, would gladly take my life, he wUl find it a difficult task even to escape after the attempt which will assuredly be futile.\" Ogle gave the necessary orders to the band, and each man dismounting, led his horse as quietly and sUently as possible up the steep, short bit of hill which led to the entrance of the castle- \" You think so, then, Captain?\" \" No, Ogle ; but I said ' Just so,' because I knew that no one to whom I might relate the cir cumstances I have detailed to you could come to any other conclusion.\" \"But Captain?\" \"WeU, Ogle?\" \"You cannot \u2014 you do not think it was real?\" \"As I Uve, I do ! \u2014 because I feel certain I did not sleep. Indeed, I was not suffering from any great or unusual fatigue at all. My senses were perfectly acute, and 1 feel sure that I heard what I heard, and saw what I saw.\" \" Then that castle,\" said Ogle, \" black as it looks, is \" Ogle had got thus far in apostrophising the castle on the hill, when a faint light shot out into the night air from one of the narrow windows of the square tower, and sent a ray far over the tree tops in the thick plantation around the build ing, and so on to the heath itseU. Captain Heron reined in Daisy. Ogle had come to a halt Without being told to do so, the band likewise paused on their route across the heath, and all eyes were fixed upon the square turret of the castle. Felix Heron had a pretty good recollection of the spot on which he had gained entrance him self on the former occasion, and his band was by no means so numerous but that it could as suredly make its way amid the abundant vegeta tion which surrounded the building. But stUl Felix Heron walked with some degree of hesitation. That hesitation had bnt one source. It was Lord Warringdale he was thinking of. And notwithstanding this wicked and unscru pulous man had heaped every possible injury he could upon the head of his haU-brother, and although Captain Heron was convinced to de monstration that Lord Warringdale only wanted the opportunity to put him to death in any man ner whttever that might be in his power, he seemed to shrink more than ever from retaliating, as surely he had a perfect moral right to do. This was what made Felix Heron hesitate as he approached that castle. No one spoke. The glare of light was there for a sufficient length of time for all to see it so that there could be no doubt whatever of the fact of its existence. Then it disappeared as suddenly as it had made itself manifest The square tower looked blacker and more gloomy than before. \" Well, Ogle,\" said Heron, \" what think you of that?\" \" Why, Captain, it is quite clear that if tbat castle is to be our quarters, we shaU have to make somebody who is there already shift theirs.\" \" Come on ! Come on !\" There he expected to find Lord Warringdale. And thus was it that he wished to go alone, until convinced by the arguments that Ogle had used that he had no right to do so, because he feared that if he went accompanied by any of those attached to him, however ho might feel inclined to spare that half-brother, they would have no such scruples. They might at once inflict upon him some sum mary punishment compromising to his life. As a prisoner, Heron would gladly hold him ; but having once made up his mind not to kUl him, he felt tbat were Warringdale to fall in any chance melee, would be to have his death lying heavily upon his mind, in addition to other sources of anxiety. More than once Heron paused to listen if any sounds came from the castle confirmatory of the Heron put Daisy to speed, and the distance that still intervened between him and the castle on Shooter's Hill was passed over in a few minutes. Ogle, with some difficulty, kept pretty weU up with Daisy; aud when the foot of the hill was reached, Heron turned to him and said, \" Halt here, Ogle, and let the band keep as close as they can to the trees and bushes. I wUl make my way into the castle by myself.\" \" Not if I know it Captain.\" \" What do you mean ?\" ' I mean this, Captain. You have no right to f11 into a danger whioh may be fatal.

This race np the hUl, however, had disqualified him for producing anything Uke a lengthened sound. \" There now,\" he said, \"I've lost my labour, and migi-t as weU have taken the hiU easy. I have to wait; but what does it matter? There's time enough for all things, and right glad am I to find myself here at last which is a wonder, con sidering the hurt I got They do say, however, that some people's skulls are thicker than othere, and I suppose mine's of the number.\" Captain Heron had his hand upon the arm of Ogle as this man spoke, and the pressure with which he compressed it became almost painful. Ogle could not comprehend why it was that the voice of this person seemed to affect Captain Heron so vividly and so strangely. But the visitor was so close to them both, that Ogle dared not speak to ask a question. \" Ah !\" said the man, who was so short of breath again, \u2014 \" I think I can manage the whistle now. That feUow, Captain Target *s he called himself, who has won most of my money at the gaming table, told me that if the worst came to the worst and I really felt disposed to come on to the road, I had nothing to do but come down here and blow a whistle three times somewhere near the entrance to this castle, and either he or some body else would come out to welcome me.\" Captain Heron slowly and carefully withdrew Ogle a few paces, eo that he could whisper to him in a very low tone, without the chance of being overheard. The broken fence was reached through which Heron had, on a former occasion, made his way ; and after passing through it with Daisy, Heron surrendered the bridle of his faithful steed to Ogle, and himself saw aU his band safely bestowed in the plantations of the castle. \" Keep quiet ! keep quiet!\" was all he said, as each one defiled past him ; \" keep quiet and heed nothing \u2014 not even a pistol-shot, unless you hear personally from me or from Ogle, or you find yourselves summoned by our own Epping Forest signals, which you know so weU !\" Murmured expressions of assent to these orders came from every member of the band, and soon Captain Heron found himself standing alone at that extemporised entrance to the grounds of the castle, and, at aU events, with a consciousness that everything was safe so far as it had gone. It was Ogle, then, who suddenly touched him on the arm, and spoke in a very low voice. \" Listen, Captain, listen !\" he said. \" Do you hear -nothing?\" Heron started, for, at that moment * sound came upon his ears which he would have heard before had he not been directing aU his energies to listen for any indications of existence within the castle ; and this sonnd, to which Ogle wished him to attend, came most unquestionably from the steep bit of road leading from the heath to the summit of Shooter's Hill. It was a footstep. Not a horse's footstep, but a man's ; and, accom panying it could be heard that panting kind of sound which indicated that whoever was approach ing, was in eager and hot haste to climb the ascent The soil was loose and gravelly, and now and then a stone, displaced by the foot of this impetuous stranger, would roll right down to the bottom of the hiU, until it reached the soft springy turf of the heath. \" Ogle ! Ogle I\" he said, \" is there not an into nation \u2014 a kind of something about that voice, which puts you in mind of one you have heard before?\" It did not positively foUow that this person, whoever he was, meant to proceed to the cattle. He might be some traveller crossing the brow of the hUl, and proceeding onward ; but a few minutes would set that question at rest \" Keep close, Ogle,\" whispered Captain Heron. \" I feel quite convinced that Lord Warringdale is in the castle ; and if this person should pause at its entrance, he is a friend and a visitor of War ringdale's, and must be secured at once.\" \" I'U have him. Captain.\" \" Do so, but inflict no injury, if you can help it\" \" Truly so,\" observed Ogle ; \" but where I have heard it before passes my comprehension.\" \"Oh, Ogle, is that possible ?\" \" It is so, Captain. But how is it that his voice affects you so strangely ?\" \" Because it is something like hers.\" \"Edith's? The Ceuntess of Whitoombe's voice?\" \" You have said it Ogle.\" \" By heaven, Captain, and so it is ! It's a very different voice too ; and yet now and then there's a kind of tone which irresistibly puts one in mind of him.\" CHAPTER XLVIII. The stranger, who, in good truth, was Bone other than John Tarleton, now blew a whistle three times rather shrilly, so that it echoed through the thick plantation around the castle- Then he spoke again in that half ribald, jesting kind of tone, which was customary with him, when he was net aoting under the influence of seme strong passion, such as fear or anger. \"I wonder if it's true,\" he said; \"and if I shaU reaUy meet any one here who wUl put me in the way of crying, ' Stand and deUver !' to a true man on Blackheath?

There was an entire absence of caution and secrecy in his mode of approach; and when he got nearly opposite to where Captain Heron and Ogle"], [140, "EDITH HERON. 134 \" And what may your name be?\" asked Ogle. \" Oh, you may caU me Jaok Deuce Ace!\" \" Which is not your name, however ?\" said Ogle, inquiringly. \" What's the odds ?

And if so, what a fool I was nearly to break my neok by tumbling down that infernal narrow staircase leading to the stables.\" These words of John Tarleton, although they will, no doubt be perfectly comprehensible to the reader, had no meaning at all for Captain Heron ; and he conld not possibly understand to what they aUuded, since he was perfectly sure that he had not encountered this man in any way what ever. \" Quite. Step this way.\" \" Where to ?\" \" Why into the castle grounds, to be sure. You don't suppose we Uve on the hiU-side, do you ? FoUow me: the early morning gets chilly; and a good nip of eau de vie, that has never been looked at by an exciseman, wUl not be the worst thing in the world\" It became now, however, an interesting subject of inquiry as to whether the three whistles, which were to be considered as a signal, would receive any response. \" Quite the contrary,\" replied John Tarleton \" To my thinking, it will be about the best for it's just what I happen to want. I'm as dry as dust, and as low as a pit\" Ogle led John Tarleton, without knowing in the least who he was, into the plantation, close up to where Captain Heron was standing ; and then, turning suddenly upon him, with that courage and determination which carried Ogle through so many disasters, and enabled him to accomplish so many feats of this kind so admirably, he caught John Tarleton by the throat, which he compressed as in a vice, and then said, in a voice very much at variance to that iu which he had carried on the conversation, \" Captain, here's one of the prisoners. I wUl choke him right off, unless you choose to take his promise that he will behave a Uttle quieter than a lamb.\" Captain Heron was probably inolined to wait to see what turn affairs would take ; but Ogle advised him, and with good reason, to a different course. \" There may be a minute or two to spare, Cap tain,\" he said ; \" for if this fellow, whoever he is, has been invited to come here and join my Lord Warringdale, it wUl take some little time, now, before they meet Let me go out Captain, and speak to him.\" \" A good thought Ogle.\" \"I fancy it will do. And I can bring him in here quite quietly.\" \" Do so \u2014 do so ! And if Warringdale is in the casUe, and sallies out in answer to the signal, you can leave him to me, so that we shall capture both our prisoners easily enough.\" Ogle thus having the permission of Captain Heron at once proceeded to put his scheme into execution. * Let him speak,\" said Heron. John Tarleton had been so entirely taken by surprise, that although Ogle relaxed the compres sion of his throat sufficiently to have enabled him to speak under ordinary circumstances, positive fright denied him the power of utterance. \"I'U settle him, CapUin,\" said Ogle. \"He's game, and won't promise.\" \" No \u2014 no !\" gasped John Tarleton ; \" I ain't game, and will speak ! I never was game ; and I'U promise anything you like !\" \" Silence, then, for your life's sake,\" said Heron. \" Secure him, and give him in charge to one of the men.\" He had not with him an artificial whistle such as John Tarleton had blown ; but Ogle had, in common with many persons of his profession, the art of producing, with the assistance of a couple of fingers, quite as shrill or as low a sound of that description as he pleased. Giving, then, three answering whistles \u2014 just sufficiently loud to catch the ear of the stranger on the hill, but by no means sufficiently so to be carried up to the castle, and so perhaps arouse the suspicions of Lord Warringdale, if he were indeed there \u2014 Ogle stepped out from his leafy covert and confronted John Tarleton. This was done in a fashion peculiarly Ogle's own. \" HUloa, comrade!\" said Ogle; \"you come with a signal in yonr month that makes you sound Uke a fiiend. Is it so; or the other way ? If you're a plant you ought to have considered first what your life was worth before venturing it here.\" In fact he might be said positively to have in vented it A piece of stout cord was put rwund John Tarleion's neck, in the form of a running noose, and with the other end his wrists were tied to gether behind his back. This was done in such a manner that the slightest movement or struggling of the bands to release them from their bondage had a tendency to tighten the noose about the neck ; so that John Tarleton, alias Jack Deuce Ace, might be considered to be comfortably disposed of. All this was done very quickly. But Felix Heron had not the slightest concep tion of the important character of the prisoner he had taken, and that this man was in possession of facts, which his fears would have induced him at any moment to make a clean breast of, that would have at once exonerated Edith from every shadow of mystery and suspicion that attached to her. And let us consider for a moment the perilous position of John Tarleton. PerUous as regarded Oapta/n Heron. Here was the murderer of the late Earl oi Whitcombe. \" Oh, I'm a friend I\" said John Tarleton. \" There's no mistake about that ! Do you happen to know Captain Target?\" \"To be sure,\" replied Ogle ; but at the same time he thought to himself, \" Who the deuce is he?\" \" WeU, then,\" added John Tarleton, \" I sup pose I'm on the right lay ?\" \" And what is that ?\" \" Why, there's no help now for me but the road. I found a deep purse a little while ago, into which 1 thought 1 conld dip my hand when ever I Uked, and it would never faU me; bnt it has, for aU that ; and I've got away with a whole skin, which, I suppose, I ought to feel grateful for.

If you want a comrade on the road\u2014 \u2014 \" \" I do,\" said Ogle. \"That's right Captain Target told me it would be aU right\" Here was the mysterious individual whom Felix Heron would have traversed half the globe to find,"], [141, "EDITH HERON, 135 in order that he might visit him with the retribu tion due to that d.stardly crime. As little did John Tarleton think that the avenger was so near him, as did Captain Heron imagine that in reality be had but to stretch out his arm, b_h1 be might place his hand upon the shoulder of the murderer of his father. played together, without knowing in the least w ho they really were. It was on the evening preceding that last visit of John Tarleton to Whitcombe House that Le Jeune had won of him everything he pos sessed.. With such oaths and imprecations as might be expected to come from a man like John Tarle ton, he had cursed and raved over his evil fortune. But we must now leave these two men in such fearful relation towards each other, while we turn our attention to Lord Warringdale. That compound of vUlany, avarice, and cow ardice was indeed in the castle. It had then struck Le Jeune that he was just the sort of man that would suit Lord Warringdale ; and after sounding him npon the subject, and finding that he had no scruples whatever as to how he procured money, Le Jeune 6poke more freely. \" Well, Mr. Deuce Ace,\" he said, \"you say yon are now cleaned ont to the last guinea, and as a man cannot gamble upon credit you will have to pursue some other course. Now, what say you to the road ?\" He was waiting with no small anxiety to hear news from London, through his associate, La Jeune. That was not an hour at which it was likely any prey would be found on tha heath, and there fore Warring'ale kept close within the castle, now and then slumbering, but stiU ever Ustening for Le Jeune's approach. The reader is well aware what prevents the late secretary of the Earl of Whitcombs from making his appearance on Shooter's Hill. Thejracas he had had with Ogle in St. James's Street and the brutal treatment he had subse quently experienced from Jonathan Wild, had, for the time being, effectually put him out of the way of being either obnoxious or useful to any one. \" I'd blow anybody's brains out,\" said John Tarleton, \" for a couple of guineas.\" \" Then you're just tha sort of fellow tbat a friend of mine wants. He is a real gentleman \u2014 in fact, a nobleman, who, in temporary difficulties, has tak'n to the road. Join him, and I dare say you will make your fortune. Go down to Shooter's HUl, close to Blackheath, any night you like, aft' r two o'clock, and whistle three times, and you will soon find some one come to you, whom you may speak to with confidence.\" John Tarleton looked at his acquaintance, Cap tain Target, as he chose to name himself, with surprise. It was perfectly true that he, John Tarleton, had lost every penny of the sum of money he had extorted from tha fears and the feelings of his sister Edith; and it was perfectly true that, in con sequence, he had uttered many bitter expressions, and cursed and raved over what he called his bad luck. But it will be as well that in a few words we state how and why it was that John Tarleton was authorized to seek the Lord Warringdale at the castle on Shooter's Hill. Warringdale was lonely. When, under the compulsion of the circum stances that had oppressed him in London, and forced him to find any refuge he conld from the ministers of the law, he sought a home in the castle, and from thence sallied out to play the part of the \" White Highwayman\" on the heath, he had no conception of the miserable and desolate existence to which he was condemning himself. It is true that Le Jeune brought him such pro visinns as he required, but the brief interviews he had with tbat ruffian constituted the only society, with one exception \u2014 and that an unpleasant one \u2014 that Lord Warringdale had. Hence he had told Le Jeune that if he eould send him from London some one who would be a sort of assistant or f3g to him in his predatory excursions, he would be glad to receive him. Lord Warringdale wanted somebody to more than share the danger of highway brigandage upon Blackheath. But he felt stiU that he had the same resource as before. Still, there was Edith to apply to. Still, there was her affection ; still, her feelings to work upon. And was he the sort of man to hesitate to make use of that newly discovered mine of wealth, which was, so to speak, dug out of the heart of Edith? Certainly not Tho words of Le Jeune, alias Captain Target brought John Tarleton, alias Deuce Ace, a Uttle to his senses. He wanted somebody who would look upon himself his an inferior \u2014 who would attend to his horse, clean his arms, and perhaps stand in the way of a stray bullet, that otherwise might dis agreeably remind Lord Warringdale himself that his occupation was dangerous. One, too, who might be left in the lurch if the constables were to press him too closely. In fact, Le Jeune, who believed himself to be permanently in the service of the Earl of Whit combe, and therefore could net come himself to be the companion and tho associate of Warring dale, had a kind of roving commission to send him the sort of man he wanted. To the surprise of Le Jeune, he replied to him coldly. \"No \u2014 no!\" he said; \"time enough to think of the read when a better trade faUe.\" \" What better trade?\" asked Le Jeune. \" I have a rich relation.\" \" Indeed, Mr. Deuce Ace !\" \" Yes, indeed, Captain Target ; bnt, for all that, I thank you for your counsel and jour confidence, and should anjthing, which is not at all likely, go amiss, I should very likely avail myself of it ; but at present my hand is in a deep pocket, and I mean to keep it there.\" Le Jeuns could not comprehend what sort, of resources the gaming-table acquaintance, whom he only knew by the name of Dance Ace, conld have; but whatever it was, he, of course, con gratulated him upon it and the two scoundrels remained as thick and intimate as ever. \" As thick as thieves,\" as the proverb has it If Le Jeune had only known who John Tarle- At the gaming-table Le Jeune had encountered John Tarleton.

It was there that these worthies \u2014 or un worthies made the acquaintance of each other; and they"], [142, "136 EDITH HERON. ton was in reality, no doubt he would have made common cause with him at once against Edith. But as it happened, both these rascals kept their secrets well, and they only knew each other as Captain Target and Jack Deuce Ace. It was this strait for money that be was in, which induced Johu Tarleton to make the visit to Whitcombe Honse on the next evening. \"Ogle!\" \"Yes, Captain!\" \"No injury.\" \" Not tbe least- Look you, Captain ! I am one who has that opinion of tha man who calls him self my Lord Warringdale, that I think if some powerful being, as large in comparison to him as I should be to some noxious reptile, were to put a foot upon him and smash him, it would be a deed well done; but knowing who and what he is in relation to you, Captain, I wiU be as tender of him as though he were a child.\" \" Ogle, I thank you. Go\u2014 go !\" It was time to go. Lord Warringdale, as we must perforce still call him \u2014 as weU for ready purposes of identity, as that we have no other name at present by whioh to designate him \u2014 had issued from tbe castle, and now paused somewhere about thirty or forty paces from whs re Ogle stood. The darkness was still excessive. What there and then happened, in consequence of his encounter with Edith, in male attire, we know. The result was that John Tarleton fuUy be- Ueved, in his own phraseology, that \" the game was up,\" as regarded getting any more money from Edith; and hence was it that calling to mind what had been said to him by his gaming acquaintance, Captain Target he sled at once to Blackheath. His great fear was to encounter in London the Earl of Whitcombe. And so, by a strange fatality, as will be seen, ho _'eU into his arms at Shooter's HUl. Neither of them could see the other. Warringdale called out in a subdued tone, \" Who goes there ? \u2014 who goes there ?\" Ogle did not think it prudent to speak. But he did think it as weU to whistle again, after the manner of John Tarleton. CHAPTEE XLIX. CAPTAIN HERON DISPOSES OF HIS TWO PRISONERS, AND KEEPS WATCH AND WARD AT THE CASTLE. The three low whistles pretty weU assured Lord Warringdale that all was right, and that this was the man of whom Le Jeune had spoken, when he had told him, in a note left at the \" Green Man\" by post, that it was possible that an assistant or humble coadjutor of the kind he wanted might come to him. We now return to that point in our story when John Tarleton found himself so securely pinioned, and in the custody of one of Captain Heron's band. John then tried to speak. A crack on the top of the head with the butt end of a pistol admonished him to be sUent That was an expressive kind of language, which he understood perfectly. He held his peace Then, as both Ogle and Heron listened intently, and kept their eyes upon the towers of Severn droog Castle, they saw again the gleam of that faint light which had shown through one of the windows. Lord Warringdale, therefore, came a few steps further down the hill. He was fully confident \" Speak !\" he said. \" Let me hear your voice.\" Now Ogle did not know what to say. The moment however, he heard Lord Warring dale speak, he knew perfectly well that all the suspicious and suppositions of himself and Captain Heron were right \u2014 for he identified him. StiU Ogle was afraid of saying too much, lest it should be something wrong. What if there were a watchword between the visitor and Warringdale ? \" He comes,\" said Ogle. \" You mean Warringdale ?\" \" I do, Captain.\" \" No doubt \u2014 no doubt He has heard the whistle, and recognises it as a friendly signal. Ogle, I wUl hold that man a secure prisoner, and then he can do no more evil in the world.\" That was an idea that struck Ogle as being very possible indeed. If it were so, he would by speaking lose the con fidence of Warringdale instantly, and there might be a precious chase for him through the planta tions. \" It will be well to do so, Captain ; for if there is evil to do in the world, my Lord Warringdale wUl do it if he is not safely laid by the heels some how.\" Ogle therefore adopted an artful expedient He did speak ; but he took good care that what he said should be perfectly unintelligible. In this way, Ogle thought the sounds might pass possibly for the right thing. \" What ?\" cried Warringdale. Ogle said again something that was not to be made any sense of whatever. \" I cannot comprehend you,\" said Lord War ringdale, coming still closer as he spoke. This was j ust what Ogle wanted. If by any finesse he could get Lord Warringdale to coma sufficiently close that he might spring upon him and take him prisoner, every end would be an swered. \"Hush! hush!\" \" Ah ! he comes, Captain !\" \" I hear a footstep on the hill-side. He has left the castle by the dilapidated old lodge gates. He comes this way. I will meet him \u2014 even I, his much-wronged brother.\" \" Captain, Captain, do not!\" \" Nay, I ought\" \"Never mind that. It don't matter one bit whether you ought or not. Let me go and bring him in here as a prisoner. There can be no good in his knowing too soon whose captive he is, and there may be some in his being kept in ignorance on that subject\" \" Let me think.\" As for Warringdale himself, there \u2022can be no doubt he attributed to timidity the conduct of the person whom he firmly beUeved Le Jeune had sent to him. Heron was silent for the next few seconds, and then he said, in a voice of emotion, \" I cannot help agreeing with yon. Ogle.\" \" To be sure, Captain \u2014 of course you do. So leave it aU to me.\" Insensibly he advanced closer and closer, until he was almost within arm's length of Ogle, and"], [143, "137 EDITH HERON. I then, by a few foolish words, he gave Ogle the cue what to say. \" I suppose you have been sent to me from London, by one whom you know weU ?\" \" I have,\" replied Ogle, in a feigned voice ; \" but I was mightily afraid of speaking to the wrong person, for in a business like this we cannot be too cautious.\" \" You are right there, my man,\" cried Warring dale, as he came close to Ogle. \" I admire and applaud your caution, and yon wUl find that such an evidence of your usefulness shall not be thrown away upon me.\" \" I am much obliged,\" said Ogle. On the moment that he spoke he sprung upon Lord Warringdale, but he did not grasp him by the throat as he had done John Tarleton ; for he was mindful of the wishes of Captain Heron, that not even any accidental injury should be done to Warringdale. Holding his arm, however, with a No. 18.\u2014 Edith Heron. firm grip, he said, in tones that had a well-acted severity about them, \" My Lord Warringdale, I know yon. You are my prisoner. Give me any trouble, or attempt to escape, and I'll scatter your brains upon the hiU-side.\" \"Warringdale raised a shout of terror. His throat was left free so tbat he was able to do so, and his firm conviction at that moment was that he was in the hands of a Bow Street officer. With the one hand he had at liberty, he snatched a loaded pistol from his pocket and leveUed it at the head of Ogle. The shadow of the trees and the thick under wood of the plantation around the castle fell eo deeply upon the road at that point, that Ogle could sc-rcely be said to see this action on the part of Warringdale. He rather had a sort of instinot concerning it And such an instinct was to Ogle but the pre lude to action. He struck up the arm of Lord"], [144, "138 EDITH HERON. Warringdalo at once, so although the pistol was certainly discharged, and with its ringing report awakened all the echoes of the hill-side, the bullet passed over Ogle's shoulder. But it was nearly being terribly fataL Ey that chance shot Lord Warringdale but narrowly missed an object which more than once he had taken infinite pains to accompl sh, with every arrangement of circumstance and premedi- tation in his favour. Tli3 bullet winged its flrght into tbe plantation, and Captain Heron was too weU accustomed to such leaden messengers of death not to be per fectly well aware, when his hat suddenly flew away from his head, that it had been struk by that pistol bullet, and that he had by some exces sively narrow margin escaped death. But he did not move. \" Avenger !\" said Heron in the same tone. During the short period that Ogle hid been absent capturing Lord Warringdale, Captain Heron had given hi9 instructions to the band ; which were to the effect that so soon as he re turned with his prisoner, they were all to foUow him. Heron, towards the castle. He had a sort of confidence that he could find his way pretty well alone, and without a guide, through the intricacies of the shrubberies and plantation, but there was roally no oocasioa now for adopting such a course. No reason existed for supposing that any ono else was in the castle, so that Captain Heron con sidered his shortest route would be to sally out into the road again, and go fairly up to the lodge gates. This he did, leading Daisy by the bridle, and soUowed by his band conducting the two pri soners. He did not speak. Felix Heron's courage was of that rare quality that never gives way to panic. His reason, too, told him that tho moment he became aware of a little circumstance like this, the actual danger had passed away. But Ogle was a little provoked. He by no means treated Lord Warringdale with the same tenderness with which he had commenced the assault upon him. The only means he had of securing a prisoner \u2014 namely a piece of stout cord \u2014 he had already used in Ihe case of John Tarleton ; but by the flash of the pistol he had seen that Lord Warringdale wore a cravat loosely tied, and which could be taken from his neck in a moment John Tarleton was by this time in a state of utter prostration from fear. Lord Warringdale, however, although quite as great a coward at heart, glared about him like an enraged tiger upon the men and horses that sur rounded him. Captain Heron himself led the van, conducting Daisy by the bridle ; and probably Warringdale, if he could only have caught the most indistinct glance at him or at Daisy, wonld have known in a moment into whose hands he had fallen. But Ogle took care that be should get no such glance, by keeping him back until some half dozen of tho baud interposed between him and Heron. And thus, in a gloomy spectml-like processioD, the party reached the old deserted gales of tho castle. We all know Ogle was a man of action, and that his resolves found ready execution almost as soon as they were formed. It was by no means surprising therefore that Lord Warringdale'* hands were securely pinioned with his own cravat before he conld be further ageressive. \"Let me go\u2014 let me go!\" said Warringdale, \"and I will pay you handsomely.\" \" I'm paid already,\" said Ogle. \" Nay \u2014 nay, that cannot be. You expect to get some reward for ray capture. You are some e'ever and experienced Bow Street officer, I fancy ?\" \" And if am, my lord ?\" \" Ah, you know me ?\" \" Of course I do. I don't come dewn here on a wUd goose chase for nothing.\" \"Then let me make things square with you. Name the sum you require, and it shall be yours. I have the means of rewarding you, and you know weU these kind of things are done every day.\" \" We will speak of that another time,\" said Ogle, who was well enough pleased to keep up tbe character of a Bow Street officer to Lord Warring dale ; \" but in the meantime, my lord, you must follow me.\" From thence the route to the little lawn in front of the main entrance was easy. When once arrived there, the mystery of tbo light which had gleamed from the wiudows was solved ; for in the hall, on a br \u2022 cket attached to to the wall, was a lantern, such as might be con veniently carried by hand, and which Lord War ringdale had left there lighted as a sort of beacon to guide him beck to his solitary residence. Ogle still kept in the rear with Warringdale, and tbe interposition of the members of the band still prevented Warringdale from recognising either Heron or Daisy as they passed through the little gleam of light which came from the hall door. A little beyond that hall door was a long con servatory ; and beyond that again, shielded by a quantity of flowering shrubs, were several out houses and barn-shaped buildings, the exterior of which were rudely fashioned into something like Gothic architecture, to suit tho general design of the castle. It was a great object with Heron to got the horses safely disposed of. The prisoners he left entirely to Ogle and to the man who bad charge of Jobn Tarleton, wLom, it will always be remembered, Captain Heron knew, as yet only by his alias of Jack Deuce Ace. Ogle accordingly, accompanied by this member of the band and the two prisoners, entered the hall. \" No, no \u2014 that Is useless. Not to London \u2014 not to London. I have money hero \u2014 name your sum. Will a hundred pounds suffice?\" \" No,\" replied Ogle, as he dragged Lord War ringdale into the plantation \u2014 \" no, nor ten hundred, nor twice that You are my prisoner; and if there be a strong room in this gloomy-looking castle, which will hold you, you shall there remain, and for once in a way you wiU be out of the power of doing mischief\" \" Yes,\" said Felix Heron at this moment in a deep voice. Captain Heron passed on, followed by the re mainder of the band. \" Halt !\" he said, upon reaching the barns and outhouses, which could be verv dimly seen against the night sky. The band came to a st&ndstUl. \" Who spoke ? Who was that ?\" asked the terrified Warringdale. \" What is his name ?\""], [145, "139 EDITH HERON. \" Who is this next me ?\" \" Number eight Captain.\" \" Number eight wUl procure a Ught\" There was a flash of one of the silent matches CHAPTER L. LORD WARRINGDALE FLNDS THAT HE HAS THE POWER OF MAKING HIS OWN TERMS WITH FEIIX HERON. then in vogue, and which were long used and known by depredators of all descriptions before they became an article of domestic economy. A hand lantern was lit and the ronte to the out offices and barns was clear and distinct The firelight lent a warm lustre to that otherwise gloomy apartment iu the castle on Shooter's HiU. Ogle had had no little difficulty to make the damp wood burn at aU ; and he had broken up a light chair which was in the room, and added its fragments to the fire on the hearth. They had the desired effect. The wood crackled and fumed, and sent ont bright and pleasant jets of flame. On the height which the castle stood, there was not a wind of heaven which could faU to be heard, let it blow ever so gently. And there, as Felix Heron eat by that hearth, he could hear the sound of the rainy south wind, as it careered round the tower, like the sea wash ing and hovering about some rock. Upon examination, they were found to be weU suited for the reception of the horses, and tolerably dry, considering that they had been out of use for many a long year. The sitnation of the castle, however, was highly favourable to drainage ; and, notwithstanding the many heavy rains both of winter and summer that must have poured down upon it and its out-offices, the whole mass of building stiU stood high and dry The absence of litter to make beds for the horses was the principal drawback ; for, as re gards food, each member of the band had brought a good bag of corn with him. \" We must be content to-night\" said Heron, \" with the best accommodation we can find. To morrow we wiU take measures to have everything in abundance.\" There was something soothing in the sound ; and after all the fatigue he had gone through, alike of mind as of body, it is no wonder that Felix Heran should yield to the soft influence of slumber. Heron was very solicitous to find a dry, warm corner for Daisy; and, being satisfied that at aU events, he had procured for her the best accom- modation he could, he told his band they might look to their own comforts as best they might \" Let proper scouts be set,\" he said, \" even as we used to do at Epping, and let the utmost cau- tion be observed. The castle is free to you all to take up your abode in any of the rooms you think proper \u2014 except a couple, which I must ap- propriate to myself; and those you will find me in, ihould you perchance blunder into them. And now, good night !\" \" We won't disturb you, C ptain. Good night ! Good night !\" Heron, with a heavy heart, walked directly into the cast'e by the haU. A door was set wide open to his right hand, and through which came the rnddy glow of fire- Ught, and there he found Ogle coaxing some rather damp faggots to burn npon the hearth. This room was partly furnished with some lum- bering articles, which would scaraely have paid for the expenses of their removal ; and, by the light from the firewood, which began to blaze and crackle up the chimney, there was a certain air of rude comfort about the place. \" Captain,\" said Ogle, \" this is the best room I can find for you.\" \" Thanks, Ogle\u2014 it wiU do well.\" \" I think I've been pretty well over the whole house 1 beg its pardon \u2014 I fancy I ought to call it a castle \u2014 and there's not much furniture to be found. The men wiU have to look out in the dU ferent rooms for the softest planks to Ue upon.\" \" And the prisoners, Ogle ?\" \" Oh, they're all right.\" \" Where ?\" He had not kept his eyes for many minutes upon the fire before they closed. \" I think, Captain,\" said Ogle, \" that I may as well now go out and see what the men are about\" Heron made no reply. He slept Ogle stepped np closer to him, and looked into his faoe. Then, on tip-toe, he gently stole out of the room, closirg the door carefully after him, so that not the least disturbing sound should awaken Heron. \" That's a good job !\" said Ogle to himself. \" He wants rest ; and perhaps a saw hours' sleep may take away that hollow look he has about the eyes, and the sadness tbat sits upon his face.\" No, Ogle \u2014 no. It is cot rest that wUl take away the sadness that sits upon the face of FeUx Heron. What he wants is the peace of mind which he thinks has fled from him for ever along with Edith. Yes : along with Edith. Once his Edith ! He thinks that she has left him ! Oh ! in jurious thought ! when her first and dearest wish is to find him, and rest once again upon his heart I But Heron slept. The fire crackled and consumed its fuel. The bright sparkling flames no longer rose np from it \u2014 a duU red colour crept over it; and as that colour shone upon the face of Felix Heron, he looked once again, under its artificial influence, as robust and as healthy as he had done when he had his only home in Epping Forest. The residence in London, although so short had robbed him of that healthy bloom. Felix Heron had turned pale. Bat now, as he slept with that fire-Ught upon his face, he seemed to be himself again. Was it all a dream that then presented itself to his imagiaatton ; or was it, in reality, by the gracious permission of Providence that he was visited by a being not of this world ? Heron never could quite satisfy himseU upon that point in after years. \" Why, there's a couple of small rooms at the top of the turret so I put one in each ; and they're as secure and comfortable as they can be.\" \" What say they ?\" \" Well, Captain, it don't come to much. One did nothing but swear, and the other did nothing but groan ; but I daresay they've left off now, as there's nobody to listen or care about it\" Heron sunk down upon a large chair which Ogle had dragged to the fireside, and sighed deeply. His heart was full of sad and dreary thoughts."], [146, "140 EDITH HERON. But what occurred to him, or seemed to occur to him, was this. the death'of his father at Whitcombe House, and to the vow ha had then made, that nothing should induce him to spare the assassin, whenever and wherever he could discover him. On the opposite side of the fire-place there was a kind of settee or ottoman, much faded and torn as regarded its covering, and in a general con dition of dUapidation and decay. Ogle had used it to place some wood upon, but that wood he had swept into the fire, so that only some fragments were left Felix Heron's idea, then, was that something suddenly aroused him from his sleep, and that he opened his eyes, without moving in any other respect, and saw that the fire had burnt low, with the exception of one fresh bit of wood that ap peared to have been recently \u2014 indeed, it could not have been above half a minute before, or it would have been consumed \u2014 cast npon it As that piece of wood burst into a flame, it Ut up the room brightly. Then Captain Heron saw that tbe settee, or ottoman, on the opposite side of the fire-place, was gccu pied. His first impulse was to spring to his feet Bnt he had no power to do so. He felt as incapable cf motion as the king in the Eastern tale, who, by tbe power of the wicked enchantress, was changed from the breast down wards into marble. Gladly would Heron have urged something in reply to the spirit which he thought ocoupied the the settee. But he could not. The flame from the smaU pieee of wood, too, that had been cast by some unseen hand upon the fire, slowly faded away. Now it was gone. The dull red Ught, duller than before, was all that could be seen in the room ; but it was suffi cient to let Heron perceive that the settee was vacant The figure, that to his senses had seemed so palpable as sitting there, was gone. It had faded away. Then it appeared as though the spell that had bound np the faculties of Falix Heron was dis pelled, for he sprung immediately to his feet. \" Speak ! oh, speak again ! Gracious vision, speak again !\" His voice resounded through the room, but there was no reply. Heron then stepped across the floor, close to the settee, to convince himself that it was indeed unoccupied. There was nothing on it but a few fragments of the firewood that Ogle had tempo rarily placed there, and one smaU piece of which bad no doubt produced the flame which so brightly had lit up the room for a few seconds, and had enabled Heron to see the apparition \u2014 if it were an apparition. Again, then, he called out aloud. \" Do not fly from me! Ob, do not fly from me yet, thou generous shade of my father! Speak to me again, if ever you loved the son who will listen to you with reverence and affection !\" All was still. Then he tried to cry ont to Ogle. But that attempt was futile. He had no power to utter a word. All be could do was to look at the mysterious figure which sat on the settee opposite to him, and the more he looked, the more he felt certain that it had the aspect and the features ol his father, tho late Earl of Whitcombe. But they were the features ideah'sed, if one may be allowed the expression It seemed to Felix Heron that he saw them, and knew that they were hid through some sort of intermediary substance, which lent to them a spiritual grace and beauty which could belong to no human face StiU for a few minutes, and then there oame a footstep in the hall, and Ogle had his head in at the door. He felt at that moment convinced that it was his father he saw before him. \"Did you call, Captain ?\" \" No, Ogle\u2014 uo.\" \" I thought I heard you.\" \" Doubtless you did, Ogle. I have had visitor I\" He would have given worlds to be able to utter ihe one word \" father I\" But all was in vain. He could not speak. He could not move. A what, Captain ?\" \" A visitor. The shade \u2014 ghost \u2014 spirit \u2014 call it what you will, of my murdered father, has been here this evening !\" Ogle looked astonished. \" Oh, Captain, you went to sleep and have had a dream \u2014 that is al] about it\" But he could see, and he could listen. The apparition \u2014 if suoh in truth it were, and not a mere conjuration of the vexed, excited brain of Felix Heron \u2014 spoke. The voice was soft and gentle. \" Son of my heart \u2014 son of this world, whose airs I even now linger among with a clinging fondness \u2014 Usten ! 0 listen !\" Heron shook his head. \" No, no ! 1 shaU never while I live, Ogle, be able to persuade myself that this was a dream.\" Ogle looked about him in rather a scared sort of way as though he expected, after these words of Heron, to see the apparition palpably in some corner of the room. Heron heard every word as plainly as though he had been at noonday standing on the wide open heath below the cistle, and some one talking to him. \" No more \u2014 oh, bo more I\" added the figure, \u2014 \" no more must the human spirit cling to the desire for that vengeance which is human, while the justice of heaven is eternal. The hand that took the Ufe of thy father, 0 Felix, must not be stilled in death by thee. There will be happiness in forgiveness \u2014 there wiU be woe in vengeance ; and, irom the records of a just and loving heaven, '.ue rash vow which bound you to a course in ord_r thai you might avenge a crime, is washed ar*-/ 1\" Au this was quite clear to Heron. It aUuded, in the most unmistakable manner, to It was quite a reUef to him to feel convinced that there was no such thing there. \" Captain, I left you asleep.\" \"les, yes!\" \" And so there was nothing more likely than that you should have a dream of some sort Heron sighed. \" I cannot attempt to gainsay it\" he replied } \"but it was more than strange. This is, however, one of those matters of which no man can hope to oonriace another by mere words. I will, how ever, sleep no more to-night\""], [147, "141 EDITH HERON. \" Don't think of it Captain.\" \" I must \u2014 in good truth, I must But you, Ogle, seek some rest I wiU go out into the open air, and try to recruit my spirits. What is the time?\" his vexed spirit although it was nothing more than what he, as a matter of course, should have suspected. As he ascended step by step, the staircase got lighter. The fact was that he was making his way to a considerable height where the rays of the early dawn had an influence. \" Nearly five in the morning.\" \" Then it should be nearly daylight Ogle ?\" \" It is so, Captain. AU the eastern sky is bright, and you can see about you well from the outside of the castle. Don't you hear the birds twittering on the tree-tops, as they can see the sun, no doubt from such a height ?\" \" I do\u2014 I do.\" The castle itself stood upon a hill, and the tower was the highest part of the castle ; there fore, as Heron ascended, it was by no means sur prising that he went bo to speak, from twUight into daylight The dawn \u2014 the bright and beautiful dawn had come ; and several rays of soft, yellow light shone upon the old stone-work of the castle. One of those rays fell fuU upon the face of Felix Heron as it made its way through one of the small, oblong windows of the tower. He accepted it as a good omen. \"Welcome! welcome, beautiful day!\" he said. \" I am among the unhappy ones of this earth ; but I can still look with pleasure upon the fair sunlight.\" \" WeU, Captain, I don't say anything against the going ont \u2014 for, if you have had sleep enough, that wUl do you good.\" \" And some rest Ogle, wiU be good for yon.\" \" I don't want it.\" \" Nevertheless, pray take it Who shall say, in the adventurous life that we lead, what chance there may be for you even to-morrow \u2014 or, rather, I should say, this night that is coming?\" \" WeU,\" said Ogle, \" I don't mean to say that a nap of an hour or so would be altogether a bad thing, but I would rather have it somewhere else than here.\" \" By which, Ogle, you express that you do not feel so sure I merely dreamt what I say I saw, as your words a Uttle time ago implied ?\" Ogle did not know very well what to say to this, but he thought bis best way was now to brave it out ; so he sat down on the chair that had been vacated by Heron, as he added, \" Well, Captain, ghost or no ghost 1 daresay it wUl do me no harm.\" CHAPTER LI. ANOTHER ARRIVAL TAKES PLACE AT THE CASTLE, AND FELIX HERON MAKES ANOTHER PRISONER. It was with some curiosity that Heron placed the key in the lock of the door that he saw imme diately opposite to him on reaching the top of the narrow staircase. \" Of that be assured, Ogle. It is a beneficent spirit\" \" Hum I I hope so \" \" And now, Ogle, teU me exactly where I can find the prisoners, for I am determined upon holding some discourse with Lord Warringdale.\" \" Yon cannot possibly miss your way, Captain. You go right np the stairs of the tower as high as you can get and then the door just opposite to you is that of the prison, as I may call it, where I have placed him.\" Ogle handed a small key to Captain Heron as he spoke, which would open the door of the room in which he had secured Lord Warringdale ; and then Heron, with a full determination to enforce from the vUlain's fears, if it were possible so to do, some authentic information regarding Amelia Staunton, at once repaired to the top of the tower. Had FeUx Heron any real hopes of procuring from the villanous Warringdale any reliable in formation whatever ? It was not that he had any fear of an attack from Lord Warringdale, for in addition to fear of that description being a stranger to hiB breast altogether, he did not give his half-brother credit enough for a sufficient amount of courage to attempt it But he was rather curious to see how it was that Ogle had secured him, and how he took his imprisonment The apartment at the top of the tower, to which the small, narrow door led, was one of confined dimensions It was Ut by what conld scarcely by courtesy have been called a window, inasmuch as it was but an unglazed, narrow aperture in the waU. But it let in light enough. A glance was sufficient to let Heron see that Lord Warringdale was a prisoner after rather an awkward fashion. Ogle had had, among his little odds and ends that he took from Epping Forest with him in a haversack, several pairs of handcuffs. One of these instruments of security he had placed round the right wrist of Lord Warringdale, and the other iron circlet round the back of a rather heavy old oaken chair that was in the room. Surely not How could he suppose that the nature of that worst of men could so suddenly change as that one word of truth should come from his lips ? But stiU it would seem that Heron's state of anxiety, now that he was fairly beneath the roof where the strange and terrible vision had pre sented itself to him, overcame aU other con siderations. Lord Warringdale, therefore, was yoked to this chair in a way that it was exceedingly difficult, with nothing but bis left hand at his disposal, to escape from. Whenever he moved about the room, he had to take that chair with him ; and anything more irk some conld not have been conceived. At any other time, when his mind might have been more free from anxieties, Heron must have smUed at the look of irritation which Lord Wai ringdale was casting on the chair. But he was too heavy-hearted now. He resolved upon seeking Warringdale. The staircase that led up to the topmost rooms of the tower narrowed as it ascended. From being tolerably broad and handsome, it became a narrow, intricate way, up or down which two people almost would have found it difficult to make their way. But there was one peculiarity connected with the ascent which pleased Felix Heron. A peculiarity that came like a soothing balm to"], [148, "142 EDITH HERON. And whatever might have been the fears or the suppositions of Warringdale in regard to the hands into which he had faUen, it had evidently not \u00a9ccurred to him that they could be those of his much-wronged brother. The shout of surprise and terror that he uttered upon seeing Heron quite sufficiently proved that his appearanoe was as unexpected as it was ter rible. Amelia Staunton ! The unhappy, the persecuted Amelia Staunton. She was the bond of union which united these two men in a kind of common interest although the circumstances under which that interest de veloped itself in their different minds were so widely dissimilar. And poor Felix Heron, with all his griefs, as he looked now in the face of Warringdale, his half brother, quite mistook the expression that he there saw. Heron said not a word. He folded his arms across his breast a ad waited ; but he looked into the eyes of Warring dale until the latter, unable to bear the gaze, slunk aside, and shook like one in an ague. \" Spare \u2014 oh, spare me I\" Still Heron did not speak. \" Oh, spare me! I see now what I might have suspected \u2014 that I am your prisoner. Some one has betrayed me; but I implore you to spare me, O brother !\" He thought it defiant. And so it was in a certain sense, but it was the defiance of confidence, because Warringdale knew that be had a price to offer for his release, which his captor would not hesitate to accept. Thai price was the hiding-place or the prison \u2014 call it which you may \u2014 of Amelia Staunton. The words trembled upon the Ups of Felix Heron \u2014 words which he wished to utter, and yet could scarcely bring his lips to form ; and at lergth it was with a great effort that he spoke, although with the sound of his own voice came confidence and vehemence, until at last in a fuU tide of indignant and eloquent passion, he ad dressed that man who had been the bane of his existence and the calamity of his life. \" As you have always spared me !\" said Heron. There was a terrible irony in his tone. It was an irony that made Warringdale's blood run cold ; for he translated it to mean, as well he might, that only such mercy \u2014 only such con sideration as he had exhibited towards Heron, would be by Heron now returned to him. If that were so, what could he have to expect bnt some terrible death ? \" Once again, Warringdale,\" he said, \" we meet and I pronounce to you a name the very sound of which shall be to yon despair or safety. I pronounce to you tbe name of Amelia Staunton \u2014 of my mother. I have a feeling \u2014 a conviction strong as though it had been whispered to me by a thousand blessed spirits from whom no truth can be hidden \u2014 that you know of her whereabouts. Tremble then, or rejoice ; for by the hosts of heaven, I swear that death shall be your portion if you still retain the gHilty secret or fife and liberty if you render it up to me ; and I shall say to you ' Go, and never let me look upon your face again!\" Warringdale now indeed felt that the game, as he would have expressed it, was in his own hands. The agony of his fears blanched his cheeks. For some few seconds he was in that state of mental dread, that he could not speak. It wonld seem as if the fixed look with which Felix Heron regarded him was of itself sufficient to dislodge bis soul from his body, and send him to his long account. He tried, then, to kneel, but the manner in which he was fastened to the chair prevented him. \" Warringdale !\" said Felix Heron, then, in a deep and solemn voice, \u2014 \"Warringdale \u2014 since by that name I presume you caU yourseU \u2014 why are you here?\" \" Why\u2014 am\u2014 I\u2014 h-re ?\" \" Yes \u2014 I repeat the question \u2014 why are you here?\" Ho had it in his power by three short words at once to dispel all the terrible anxieties of Felix Heron npon this subject ; and although, from the moment that Heroa spoke \u2014 and, in good truth, be fore he spoke \u2014 he had determined to give the in formation as the price of his own safety, he could not forego the satisfaction of playing a little with the distress that was but too manifest in the speak ing features of Felix Heron. \" And so you would at last murder me ?\" he said. \" Because \u2014 beoause I \u2014 I \u2014 because I cannot get away. I am your prisoner, am 1 not?\" Warringdale was evidently recovering from th\u00bb first accession of fright which had come over him, and probably from the sad and earnest man ner of FeUx Heron, he thought there was some chance of, by a little effrontery, saving himself altogether from the consequences of the misad venture that had befallen him. It did not need any very great amount of mental acumen to enable Warringdale now to understand his position ; aud inwardly he cursed his own folly for remaining a single hour longer at that place after the discovery by Felix Heron that it was his retreat \" No.\" \" You have threatened me with death !\" \" No ; but I will give you np to that offended justice which calls aloud for the condemnation of such a fiend in human form. With my grasp upon your throat, I would drag you to the metro polis ; and, castiBg your writhing form at the feet of one of the judges of the land, I would proclaim aloud \" He had not the slightest doubt that it was Heron's object to give him up to the law ; for as yet, in consequence of not having had an oppor tunity of seeing his rascally associate, Le Jeune, he was quite ignorant of the startling and re markable occurrences that had taken place so re cently at Whitcombe House. But Warringdale was not discouraged. He had a reason for feeling the utmost confi dence in being able, at the very last moment, to say sotnethint* which would have such an effect upon Felix H_ron that he might make his own \"What\u2014 oh, what?\" asked Warringdale, turn ing pallid with fear. \" Does not your conscience tell you ? Does not your own base heart shape the words that wonld come ringing from my lips ?\" \" No \u2014 no 1 You cannot say I \u2014 that I have taken tha Ufe of any one akin to you !\u2014 yon can not accuse me of \u2014 of murder 1\" \"Yes, murder!\" shouted Heron; \"that is the word ! Murder most foul, as at the best it is, but this more foul than common murder, because it terms. And it eo happened that that something was the very thing which Hercn came to ask him."], [149, "143 EDITH HERON. was soUowed by tha baseness of attempting to fix the stigma of the crime upon another !\" \" What other ?\" \" In this casUe ? Even here ?\" \" Even here.\" \" Take me to the room ; I cannot brook delay. My brain fires at the thought and my heart beats as though it would burst its confines. Take me to the spot at once \u2014 at once. Where is the room?\" \" Myself.\" \" You ?\u2014 you, Felix Heron ?\" \" Ay, even me; for the words that I would cry aloud into the ears of justice would be, ' Here lies the murderer of the late Earl of Bridgewater ; and here lies too the man who has more than once sought the life of his greater, better, and nobler son, who now eo worthily wears the coronet ! I acouee him, and I resign him to the death !\" \" No, no\u2014 not that ! Felix Heron\u2014 Felix Heron, I will teU all ! You cannot prove\u2014 you have no means to prove that it was my hands that did the deed I\" Heron immediately produced from his pooket \u2014 where, indeed, by mere accident he had it placed, aa it had been for a few days in his custody, by the young Earl of Bridgewater\u2014 the diamond ring, of suoh remarkable value and beauty, which the late Earl had worn on the occasion of his murder In Paddock HUl Lane. \" You have already seen it Yonr eyes looked upon the mystery, but missed tha secret\" \" Yes,\" cried Heron ; \" I now comprehend. There is an apartment in this building which presents a fearful sight and there have been times when I have thought that 6ight surely nothing but a vision of my own disturbed and disordered fancy. But your words pronounce it a reality. There is a table, and there are two chairs, sauted in which are poor remains of humanity. There are two skeleton forms, over whioh are thrown habiliments that might belong to the Uving. Is that the mystery?\" \" It is.\" \" Solve it, then. What means the horrifying spectacle?\" \" I cannot tell. I said there was a mystery and a secret The mystery must remain one, for I have no clue to it The secret I have told you: in a still lower chamber beneath that apartment and only to be reached in the way I have in dicated, you will find Amelia Staunton. And now I claim your promise to set me free.\" \" Yet a moment,\" said Heron, speaking evi dently under the influence of violent agitation, \u2014 \" yet a moment I must have pointed out to me the route to that chamber, or I may have te pull down this building stone by stoae, and brick by brick, untfl I find it.\" \" There is no difficulty,\" replied Warringdale, gloomily. \" At the head of the first flight of steps from the ground floor is a corridor, which you have traversed once in pursuit of me, and, therefore, should know it Various apartments open from it to the right, into any one of which you have but to make your way, sinca they all communicate the one with the other. In the last one there is an old-fashioned closet or cupboard, at the back of which there is a door opening\u2014 not as an ordinary door \u2014 but sliding sideways, easUy and simply by a touch, into the thickness of the wall. That door conducts you into the cham ber of tbe mystery and of the secret. And now, Felix Heron, you know as much as I do ; and I claim the fulfilment of your promise to let me go free, with parfect immunity for the past, so far os you are concerned, up to this moment of time.\" \" You claim a larger promise than I gave,\" replied Heron, in choking accents ; \" bnt I wUl not cavil with you. Take it.\" Heron's feelings were in so great a state of ex citement at the prospect of recovering his long lost and much-sought mother, that he could scarcely speak to Warringdale ; and the little that ha did so was in so strange and altered a tone, in consequence of the effort it cost him to keep down the gush of feeling which seemed each moment welling up from his heart, that Warringdale \u2014 who was a stranger to all suoh gentle emotions \u2014 looked upon him with surprise. Heron then flung open the door of the turret chamber, and pointing down the little, narrow, tortuous staircase, he said, \" Go\u2014 go, in peace I I release you.\" ______ \"But not practically,\" replied Warringdale. \" How on earth am I to go, handcuffed as I am to the back of this infernal chair?\" Warring dale turned deathly pale, and uttered a It wiU be recollected how, long, long ago, in the earlier portion of this story. Warringdale had wrested from the hand of the dying Earl that glit tering jewel ; and now, as it flashed in the morn ing light which shone so serenely and so sweetly into that tower chamber, its beauty was to him as the eye of a basilisk, which he dared not look upon. \" Spare me !\" he gasped ; \" and I will tell all ! Let me go free, and yon shall know where Amelia Staunton is ; and I will at once strive to mollify your anger by the information that she is well and nninjured by me, which I swear to by the heaven above us!\" \" It is well that you so swear, for could I but convict you of injury to one hair of that innocent head, it were well for ycu, 0 Warringdale, that you had never breathed the breath of life !\" \" Say, then, that you will let me go free \u2014 say that you wiU release me from this vile durance \u2014 say that you wUl not haud me over to the officers of justice, whom I now feel certain you have brought against me \u2014 and the long- cherished secret of where the first and Uving wife of our common father \u2014 that is, your mother \u2014 may be fouud, shall be im parted to you.\" \" I say it.\" \" You have asked me to swear !\" \" Peace ! I have spoken ; it is enough. And I ask you, Warringdale, where ij Amelia Staun ton?\" \" There is a room in this castle in which there is a mystery and a secret. The mystery I have no power to explain to you, but the secret is in my possession.\" \" What seoiet ?\" \" There is a chair, so heavy, so lumbering, and placed in such seeming convenience near to the wide hearth of one of the ancient chimney -pieces, that no one would think of moving it ; and were you to make the effort, it would probably be in a wrong direction, and that chair would seem to be fastened, beyond power of moving, to the floor; bnt if it be pressed backward, as though with an effort to overturn it in that direction, it will bring with it a hinged portion of the flooring, of exactly the width and breadth on which it stands. Be neath, there is a flight of steps ; pursue them, and you will fiud Amelia Staunton.\" \" My mother ?\" \" 1 know no mothers, but that is the person of the name you seek.\""], [150, "144 EDITH HERON. and his composure that be so lingered ; and then, with a gasping sob that he could not suppress, he said, \"Mother! mother! persecuted Countess of Whitcombe, I come to seek and to save thee; and woe be to them who may now seek to stay me ! Hcream of terror, as Felix Heron suddenly drew his sword from its scabbard with a flashing move ment, which made the bright blade glitter in the sunlight, and stepped towards him. He thought that surely then and there his last moment had come. \" No, no!\" he shrieked, \u2014 \" do not kiU me thus; rather give me up to justice ; for, if the law has no mercy, I yet shall live a little longer.\" \" VUlain!\" cried Heron, \"do yon believe all as base as yourself ? Have I not promised you your worthless life ? There may be dark stains in the blood of the Whitcombes, but there are likewise pure and bright spots that I will hope that I possess.\" What Heron meant to do with the sword was then evident, for he brought its edge down upon the baok of the ohair with such a slashing cut that the strong oak was riven, and the terrified Warringdale found himself free, although the empty handcuff still dangled from his wrist \" Go now,\" added Heron ; \" you are free 1\" \" But the officers ? You have officers below \u2014 will they allow me to pass ?\" CHAPTER LII. THE LONG SEARCH FOR AMELIA STAUNTON IS OVER ; BUT FELIX! HERON ENCOUNTERS THB SHADOW OF HIS MOTHERS HEABT, INSTEAD OF THE SUBSTANCE. Every word that the villanous Warringdale had uttered in regard to the directions which he, Felix Heron, was to take to find his mother in the castle, had sunk deep into his memory. It seemed to him that he kept continually hear ing those few and concise directions over and over again repeated by the very atmosphere around him. What he dreaded was, now, that anything in the shape of interruption to his searoh would take placa \u2014 that some present duty towards his men would interfere. He darted throngh the hall as though he was being pursued by some one ; and it was a positive relief to him when he tad gained the top of the flight of stairs. He was now in that corridor which had been mentioned by Warringdale as the one from whence the suite of rooms opened that would conduct him to the chamber of mystery. Through the first door that presented itself, Heron with precipitation made his way. The apartment was small into which he entered, and was totally destitute of furniture. A glance seemed sufficient to assure him it was not the one he sought. There was no cupboard, closet, or cabinet there, in which could be found the secret door ; so he passed on into the room adjoining, through an open doorway. That apartment was considerably larger than the first one, and had evidently been at one tinea a room of some pretensions, for there were still the remains of faded hangings on the walls. The windows likewise were large, and the ceUing had npon it one of those sprawling alle gorical paintings which were at onetime so much the fashion. Heron saw the mistake which Warringdale laboured under ; and, in the interests of his band, be thought it just as weU he should continue in it. There could be no doubt but that Warringdale's impression was that Felix Heron, as Earl of Whit combe, and by his own authority, had brought down a party of constables to Shooter's Hill to apprehend him. Such being the case, Warringdale, after leaving the castle, would not be likely to be nearly so dangerous or so mischievous as if he thought it merely in the occupation of Captain Heron and his band. \" Follow!\" cried Heron: \" my word will set you free. Follow quickly; but woe, woe be unto you, my Lord Waringdale, if you have deceived me in any essential particular as regards this matter, which is so near and dear to my heart!\" There was quite sufficient about the tone and manner of Felix Heron to terrify Lord Warring dale, and to make him feel how dangerous it would be in the smallest degree to trifle with him. He soUowed his captor in silence. Down the narrow tower stairs \u2014 down to the ground-floor of the building, and then out into the hall, where one of Heron's band kept watch and ward as a sentinel \" Let this man go free !\" cried Heron. \" Let this man go free; and let no one even look to see the path he takes !\" This order was quite sufficient. The sentinel stood aside; and, to his great relief, Lord Warringdale s'epped ont of the hall of Severndroog Castle into the open air. \" London ! London !\" he said, in low tones, to himself. \" London is the place for me ! Too long have I vegetated in this gloomy abode ! London, with aU its frauds, all its chicaneries, all its villanies, and all its thousand and one modes by which such a man as I am may Uve,\u2014 is the place for me !\" Felix Heron, however, did not allow himself above a couple of brief moments of time to look at these things. All his attention was concentrated towards a door which he saw at the further end of this apartment, and which he thought would probably conduct him to a third room, w hich might be the one he sought But such was not the case. He was disappointed, although agreeably ; and yet the discovery that this door, that he thought was that of another room, was actually the door of a cupboard, such has had been deecribed by War ringdale, almost took his breath away. He was compelled to pause and press his hand upon his heart to stUl its tumultuous beating. \" Can it be, oh ! can it be,\" he cried \u2014 \" can it be that a gracious heaven condescends in this period of my heart's secret grief from the loss of one who I thought would love me for all time, to grunt me the discovery of that poor mother who has .ul sored so much?\" He was light Lord Warringdale's was not the fit spirit for a life on the road. The metropolis, with its gaming tables, was the proper 6phere of action of such a man. _ ,. , . For only a few seconds Felix Heron Ungered ui the hall of the castle. It was to recover, by a groat effort, his strength"], [151, "EDITH HERON. 145 That was the idea of Felix Heron at that It was that the back of the cupboard did no, open Uke an ordinary door, but slid on one side into a groove made for it in the thickness of the wall. moment. He was to be compensated for the loss of his Edith, by the discovery of his mother. Alas ! Did he suppose it possible that the void left in his heart by the supposed loss of Edith could ever be filled up, even by the love of a mother? Ah, no! The moment he tried that plan the whole panel moved easily. And then Heron felt certain that be had not been deceived, and that he was in reality about again to set foot in that most mysterious chamber where once before he had seen the terrible effigies of death. There is a love, which is not the love of a son even for a mother \u2014 of a father for a child. It was that love which had received so terrible a shock in the mind of poor Felix Heron, and which could know no alleviation until he once more should hold his Edith, as of old, to his heart. It was not in human nature that he should not pause for a few seconds ; but the pause lasted no longer than to permit him to draw two or three anxious breaths, and then he was in the chamber of the mystery and the secret The mystery which he did not know, and the secret which he did. Once twice, thrice, he made an effort to force open the panel at the back of the cupboard. It wonld not move. And then he recollec'ed the only point on the precise and clear instructions of Warringdale that he had forgotten- It was dark. But some Ught made its way into it throng!/. No 19.\u2014 Edith."], [152, "EDITH HERON. 146 He might terrify, but could not comfort his mother if she were indeed there. He must have light\u2014 light on the instant that it could be procured. He sprang up again into the room that contained the two skeleton forms. He was through the opening at the back of the cupboard, and into the large apartment and then into tho small one, and then into the corridor, with a speed that mocked at delay. Ihe panel that Felix Heron had pushed aside at the back of the cupboard, so that he could dimly see about him ; and each passing second he could see better, for his eyes got more and more accustomed to the sort of twiUght that was in the room. Shadowy, but palpable enough, there were the two skeleton figures seated by the table. Heron shuddered as he saw them. He had an indistinct idea that on the occasion when he had before looked npon them, one had surely fallen ; but if it were so, the mystery was greater stiU, for they both sat in their ohairs, ter rible in their stillness. Heron was glad, probably, at that moment that the light in that room was not stronger than it was. \" A light !\u2014 a light !\" he cried aloud\u2014\" a light I Oh, Ogle ! if you love me, bring hither a light !\" The voice of Captain Heron rang clear and loud through the castle. Ogle heard it. That faithful follower of Heron's was in the same room below where he, Heron, had for a short time slept and had the strange vision, which yet he could not oonvince himself was all a dream. Ogle was busy in preparing for Heron such a breakfast as the contents of the haversack he had brought with him from Epping Forest migbt enable him to produce. Bat at the sound of Heron's, voice calling so loudly from the corridor above, Ogle dropped his oulinary utensils, and snatohing up tho still Ughted lantern by the aid of which he had lit a fire, he sprang up the staircase. What conld Captain Heron want with a light, now that each moment the young day was bright ening ? The shadowy condition of the atmosphere pre vented his eyes from dweUing too particularly upon the painful aspects of those two remnants of poor humanity. And now, as he cast his eyes towards the chimney-piece of the room, and saw drawn np close to it the large, heavy, old arm-chair, just as Lord Warringdale had desoribed it, aU doubt, if any indeed remained, of the truth of the statement that had been made to him, vanished. Beneath the very boards on which he trod might be that poor Amelia Staunton whom he so longed to look upon\u2014 whom he had sought so long, and who, no doubt would find in one glance at his eyes almost a compensation for all the suf fering she had passed through. For was he not her son ? But he had shouted for one, and there it was. \" Captain ! Captain, I am here ! What has hap pened? What is amiss?\" \"A light! \u2014 a light! Oh, you have one! Thank heaven! Give thanks to heaven, Ogle, and follow me 1\" Huron snatched Uterally the lantern from the hands of the astonished Ogle, and dashed back again into the suite of rooms. \" He is mad ! \" said Ogle. It was the firm conviction of Ogle that the wits of Captain Heron had given way, but that did not prevent him from folio wing him as quickly as he possibly could. No speed, however, that he could make at all came up to the sort of rush with which Heron made his way back to the trap-door in the floor of the room of the mystery, and of the two skeletons. Her own son ? Ah! what compensation for any evil and for any suffering can equal the joy of a mother's heart as she looks into the eyes of her own boy ? Heron, with a swift and sUent kind of rush, made his way to the chair. One touch was enough. It was, as Warringdale had said, immoveable in the ordinary way, but it bent over backwards easUy enough. And with it came, clinging to its feet, the square trap-door that he, Warringdale, had made men tion of. \"Mother! mother! it is I\u2014 your son \u2014 your own child \u2014 your Felix ! Oh, heaven ! let this voice reach the poor mother's heart ! Mother \u2014 it is your own son who calls to you ! I am here ! here ! here ! Speak but one word to assure me that you live I\" A shriek came np from the cavernous looking depths below that chamber. Heron recoiled with horror. The consequence was, that by the time Ogle reached that apartment Captain Heron had dis appeared down the aperture in the floor, carrying the lantern with him. But that aperture still remained open. And so, glaring upwards, there came some rays from the light Not only did these rays enable Ogle to see that there was such an opening in the floor, down which he might otherwise have perhaps fallen; but, combined with the daylight that made its way into the room, he was able to see the two terrible mementos of humanity, seated at the table- Then Ogle began to think that ha was dream ing. He rubbed his eyes. He pinched his ear \" Ogle! \u2014 Ogle!\" he said, \u2014 \"Ogle, awake!\" Then he hoard the voice of Captain Heron, as if from some depths far below the floor. \" Help !\u2014 help !\u2014 help I\" That was the word, thrice repeated. Once would have been quite enough for Ogle. In a moment he was down through the opening in The shriek was one that could scarcely be sup posed to come from any mortal lips. It seemed to search through every chamber of his brain, aud to knock at his heart as though with a terrible blow. He conld hesitate no longer. He made a kind of plunge down the aperture iu the floor, and it was only by great good fortune that his feet alighted upon a slight of steps. \"Mother! mother! Speak to me! It is your son who seeks you ! Banish all fear, and speak to me !\" Al! was still. The darkness was profound.

AU his faculties wore absorbed in \u00ab contemplation of those features which now he felt certain he had seen before. \"Captain! Captain, speak again! Where are yon?\" \" Here !\u2014 here !\" But where ? For a time, memory would not serve him ; and then ho suddenly recollected the poor mendicant, bereft of reason, who had for a few brief minutes encountered him once on the door- step of Whit combe House, and who had then fled from him in dismay. And then he knew that that was his mother. \" Dead ! dead ! dead !\" he said again. \" The dead are happy, Captain !\" said Ogle. \" Ogle !\" \" Yes, yes ! I am here 1\" \" My good fellow, Ogle, you will hold the Ught for me. You see this is \u2014 or this, I ought to say was, my poor, poor mother !\" \" Yes, Captain. But \" \" Hush ! I introduce you to her. This, mother, is my faithful, honest friend, Ogle. He is proud to be introduced to the Countess \u2014 the Dowager Countess Amelia of Whitcombe.\" Ogle was about two-thirds down a narrow and somewhat slippery flight of steps. Captain Heron appeared at the foot of them, holding up the lantern in his hand. As the Ught of it feU upon Heron's face, Ogle could see that it was fearfully pale. \" Good gracious, Captain, what do you do here in this gloomy place ? \u2014 and what do you want \u2014 what have you seen ?\" \" A sight, Ogle, to sear the heart !\" \"What?\u2014 oh, what?\" \" My poor, poor mother!\" \" Amelia Staunton ?\" \"Ay, Ogle!\" The tone in which Heron framed those two short words, had in it such a world of grief that Ogle was moved to tears. He had never heard such despair in any human tones, and could not have believed that the expression of so much grief could have resided in two such words. Ogle felt quite convinced now that the reason of Captain Heron was on the wane. But he took the lantern which was handed to him, aud then he saw Heron stoop down, and, lifting his mother in his arms, he, without another word, commenced the ascent of the slight of stairs that led to the upper rooms. He was by the side of Captain Heron in another instant \" Where \u2014 oh, where, Captain Heron, did aU this come about ?\" \" Look !\" Heron took Ogle by the arm, and led him a few paces along some cold, damp stones ; and then ho held the lantern so that he could see into a corner where there appeared to be some straw, and lying upon it a something that surely was a human form. Ogle followed with the light Ee was not a Uttle glad to get out of that terrible and gloomy place. Heron then turned aud spoke again to Ogle. \" Your wife,\" he said ; \" your wife, Ogle \u2014 where is she ?\" Could that be Amelia Staunton? \" Sha was to have been here as soon this morn ing as she could, by the stage down to Green wich.\" Could that be the once fair young girl, with whose beauty the great rich, noble Earl of Whit combe had been so enchanted, that at the altar he had made her his ? \" That is well, Ogle. She can, for a brief space, be waiting woman ts the Countess \" \" Yes, Captain.\" Poor Ogle did not very weU know what to say. In the large room that they now reached through the cupboard panel, there was a couch that had at one time been rich and costly with its covering of crimson velvet On that, FeUx Heron reverently placed his mother, and slipping hastily off his coat he laid it softly over the body. Then Ogle uttered a cry, \" Captain, Captain ! She is not dead ! She moans ! She is not dead !\" Could that be the Countess of Whitcombe who had been so displaced from her proper state ts make way for another, and then had been the victim of such cruel, such unheard-of persecu tions? Alas for human grandeur ! Alas for human beauty ! On that damp and wretched truss of straw lay an old woman in rags ! Thin to attenuation with long suffering \u2014 the aspect surely of death npon her face ! \" Good heaven !\" ejaculated Ogle. Heron spoke not. He moved not. Captain Heron stifled the shout that was upon his lips, and flew to the couch. Amelia Staunton moved. Ha looked with a cold and terrible stare in the face of the apparently dead. Her eyes were open, and she looked gently and sadly about ber. Ogle had, the instant that he made Captain Heron aware of the fact that his mother was stiU in life, made but one rash from the room. His idea was a good one. It was to get, from the fira in the room below, soTe coffee that he had beeu preparing carefully for Heron's own breakfast Oglo, it will be remembered, had not on all occisions been in the habit of congratulating either himself or his wife upon their meetings; but this time he was positively delighted to find that Mrs. Ogle had arrived, and had installed her self by the fireside. \"Bravo, Nancy I\" he cried \" I was just say ing I would give a good hundred guineas to sei you.\" \" Oh, O^le, you don't mean that ?\" \"Yes, Idol\" Ogle was alarmed at the expression of his face. \" Oh, Captain, Captain !\" he said. \" Remember \u2014 oh, remember yet that there is one to live for !\" Heron looked at him as if he did not compre hand the words he nttered- \" Rouse yourself, Captain ! Remember Edith I\" Ogle was half afraid to pronounce the name of Edith, and yet it was the most powerful spell he could think of to command the attention of Felix Heron. Much would poor Ogle have preferred rage to this terrible look of apathetic misery that was upon Heron's face. \" Dead ! dead! dead !\" moaned Heron. It was something to get him to speak. No doubt he had not heard one word of what Ogle had said. All his attention was fixed upon the face of his"], [154, "EDITH HERON. 148 had brought back peace, concord, and happiness to Whitcombe House. Alas ! what a different tale had Edith to tell her. \" Give me some of them now, then, at once, for I am not fit to be seen. This is the only dre<s I have iu the world, and my bonnet is shameful.\" \" Never mind.\" \" Never mind ! But I do mind !\" \" Come on. Follow me, and yon shaU have twenty bonnets, and welcome. Bring that cup and saucer. Be quick, Nancy, and foUow me !\" \" T wenty bonnets ?\" \" Yes, or more ; but don't stop now a moment, for there is a lady up-stairs who wants you \" \"A lady?\" \" Yes, yes ! Good gracious ! Come on !\" \" Tweuty bonnets! Oh, Ogle, I will say that you do know how to treat a woman ! I'm a com ing \u2014 I'm a coming!\" Ogle had snatched up the hot coffee, and Mrs. Ogle now followed him with the cup and saucer; and so they both made their way up the staircase again that led to the large room where Felix Heron and his mother had been left alone. But in the midst of her own griefs and intense anxieties, Edith was mindful of Lady Castleneau's age and failing health, and was fain not to disturb her at such an unseemly hour. \" Tom,\" she said, \" you must manage to make your way into the court-yard, and let old Anthony know of my arrival. It will be some hours yet before my aunt is stirring, and I would not will ingly have her disturbed. It is sad indeed, in her old ag\u00bb, when she should enjoy peace and quiet ness, the afflictions of others should be productive to her of so much uneasiness.\" \"All's right, Lady Edith!\" said Tom. \"Why, it's as easy getting over this old gate, as walking up-stairs! But I'U tell you what I was thinking. It won't do at all for me to keep Jonathan Wild's horse, for I daresay there isn't a constable or officer in aU London that doesn't know it by sight.\" - \u2022 \" That is true, Tom ; it must be disposed of at once.\" Those had been blessed moments. \" Mother ! mother ! Look at me ! Look in my face ! Look in my eyes, and tell me you do know me!\" \"WeU, that might be done; but I think it better to let it go.\" \" That is what I meant, Tom. Surely you do not imagine that I proposed to you to sell it ? Let it go, at once ; and let who may, now, pick it up in the streets.\" \" All's right I\" said Tom. \" I daresay it's easy enough to start the creature off from here ; but I have a fancy, from the feel of it, that there's some sort of pocket in Jonathan's Wild's saddle.\" Tom, with the assistance of a knife, that he was seldom without, ripped open the saddle of WUd's horse; but he did not find the purse of guineas he so fully expected, aud looked rather blank and disappointed when only a kind of memorandum book presented itself. \"Now, that's what I call shabby!\" said Tom. \" I suppose this is his pocket- book, where he keeps the names of all the fellows ho means to send to Tyburn next sessions I'll have a look at that when l'va nothing better to do- And now, MLss Edith But\u2014 oh!\u2014 stop\u2014 stop!\" \" What is it, Tom ?\" \" Have you any objection to me calling yoa Miss Edith? \u2014 it comes out quite unawares.\" \" None iu the teast, Tom \u2014 it matters not. But be quick, now, for tha dawn is approaching rapidly, and early wayfarers wUl soon be in London streets.\" Amelia Staunton made an effort to speak, but she could not. The long looked for moment had come \u2014 the moment she had prayed for, hopfd for \u2014 and so often, in the midst of all her prayers, despaired of. She looked upon her own son \u2014 she was with him, and she felt his arm around her. The speU of partial insanity which her suffer ings had cast around the brain of Amelia Staunton was broken with that first grateful gush of tears. She held Felix Heron close to her heart, and sobbed aloud. But there are feelings too sacred for the pen of the descriptive writer. Let these of the mother who for the first time looks upon her son, be of them Happy, happy, Amelia Staunton ! Heaven is merciful 1 You are repaid at last ! CHAPTER LIII. TOM RIPON GIVES ADVICE TO EDITH, AND THEY ARE BENIGHTED. It wUl be recollected that Elith determined upon returning to Castleneau House with Tom Ripon, after their perilous adventure with Jonathau WUd iu the narrow road leading from Epping Forest. She could not but feel very much fatigued ; aud now that the excitements of that evening were over, a sense of exhaustion succeeded them, which amounted to almost absolute pain. It was a great relief to Edith to find herself aga:c fairly iu the streets of London, j ust as the dawu was breaking The feeling with which she now regarded Whifcombe House amounted to something like aversion; aud if she hai not had her aunt's re sidence, iu Bloomsbury Fields, to go to, she would not have turned her horse's steps in tho direction of that mansion where she had known so little happiness, but certaiuly such abundant mis-ry. Poor old Lady Castleneau had fondly imagined that all was well. Hearing nothing more of Edith on that night she had concluded \u2014 as, indeed, she had every right to conclude \u2014 that her advice had been taken, \u00bbud that by declaring aU to Felix Heron, Eli;h Tom gave Jonathan Wild's horse rather a sharp cut with a small twig of a tree he had pulled for himseU on the road from Epping, to serve tha purpose of a riding-whip. The horse did not need this impulse to be re peated, but started off at a good round trot through the streets of London Clambering over the iron gate, then, which closed in the court-yard of old Castleneau house, Tom made his way rouud to the domestic offices, aud with some diffi.ulty succeeded in rousing up old Anthony, and letting him kuow who it was that desired admituuoe at that early hour. The name of Edith was a potent spell to awaken the attentiou of the old man, for he was most fondly attached to her ; and soon the great gate of Castleneau House was opened, and Edith found l.e-self iu a haven of safety. \"My auut?\" bhe said. \"My dear aunt? \u2014 is she well ?\" \"Ah, dear heart!\" said old Anthony. \"Yes."], [155, "149 EDITH HERON. But she sat up v.ry late, and I fancy she thought to seeyour ladyship again before retiring to rest. But bless us and save us ! Is masquerades or play-houses in fashion ?

Be charitable to me, and believe my motives to be pure and good.\" \" Who shall doubt them \u2014 who shall doubt them ? Bless us and save ns !\u2014 who shaU doubt them ?\" It was not necessary for Martha to finish her sentence, for \"the manner in which she cast her eyes to a chair by the bed-side, on which Edith had flung her masculine attire \u2014 laying those superb pistols the gift of Felix Heron, on tbe top of all- sufficiently explained her meaning. \"You are kind 'and considerate^ Martha, and have acted just as I would wish. There arose a necessity last night for me adopting a disguise, and a similar necessity may arise again. I wonld fain spare my good, kind aunt any anxieties on my account; so I may possibly not, for a time, communicate to her \u2014 for that reason only \u2014 that I have worn this dress.\" \" Not you, ever, I am sure, my good Anthony ; but I am terribly fatigued, and would fain lie down and rest untU my aunt be stirring.\" \" There's the blue room,\" said Anthony, \" with the big old down bed ; and there's the red room, with the ebony bedsead; and there's the yeUow room ; and there's \"Oh, Anthony, Anthony \u2014 any room wiU do for me.

Dear me ! dear me I I thought everything was so well and so happy, and that you had become a Countess, and the happiest woman in the world ; but I think every- body loses their wits, and evet^thing goes wrong now-a-days. It wasn't so when I was young \u2014 oh, dear, no ! Bnt that was a matter of sixty years ago, and I suppose the world changes. But not for the better \u2014 not for the better !

And yet, no \u2014 I cannot blame Felix. What reason could withstand the seemingly accumulated evidence against me ? I alone, by shrouding in mystery that which should have been clear and open as the day, produced a complication from which I alone ought to have suffered. B.r, alas! \u2014 alas! it is a condition of human existence that we can never suffer alone.\" \" Ah, my lady \u2014 my lady ! I hear your aunt's bell, and must go to her.\" \" I will be in the breakfast-room quickly. No, no \u2014 I cannot! And yet perhaps, yon can help me, as I came in these clothes ? I have no others.\" \" Dear me, my lady ! don't you recoUect when you came away from Fiusbnry Square, in Sir John Tarleton's time, and matters were patched up a little between him and my lady, your aunt\u2014 a whole chest-fuU of your clothes was brought, and has remained ever since ? And here they are in this very room ; for yon know you always had the big down bed and the blue room ! \" Edith was most grateful and thankful that this difficulty was thus disposed of; and in another quarter of an hour she was clasped in the arms of her aunt who, in that same breakfast-room, where we have so often seen that admirable and gentle specimen of a real old gentlewoman, had been waiting to receive her. \" My Edith\u2014 my own Edith ! you have come to tell me that all is well ?\" Edith's tears flowed as she clasped her aunt's hands in hers. \" Come, come, chUd ! \u2014 don't go on talking in that way ! Would you like some bread and butter ?\" \" Now, I tell you what it is, my old bantnm !\" paid Tom ; \" if you think that's funny, I don't. A glass of hot grog and a pipe I should have no sort of objection to ! And I say, old cockalorum! are there any pretty girls in the house, eh ?\" \" Goodness gracious !\" exclaimed old Anthony, lifting up his hands ; \" and this is the way children talk now-days 1 Well, well ! I suppose it can't be helped ! Come along, you young rascal, and don't be whistling there, waking np the whole house !\" \" All's right old dot and carry one! I can sleep anywhere. \" ' A life on the road\u2014 a life on the road\u2014 A lite on the road for me 1 Pistols primed, a good smart nag, And a life on the road for me !'\" Poor old Anthony was completely terror stricken at Tom's audacity, but he accommodated him with comfortable sleeping quarters for all that ; for let him be what he may, Anthony had not faUed to hear that Edith had called him her friend, and that was quite sufficient passport to his affections. Edith fell into a deep and dreamless sleep \u2014 one of those sleeps that seem to last but for a few fleet ing moments, but are in reality hours in duration \u2014 and she was somewhat surprised to find herseU aroused by her aunt's servant, Martha, who had beeu apprised of her arrival by Anthony, and who, to her astotishment, informed her that it was eleven o'clock in the day. \"Oh, Martha, that surely cannot be possible I\" said Edith. \"No \u2014 alas, no!\" she said. \"Strange things have happened \u2014 things of which I have but as yet a faint conception. But Felix had left Whit combe House, and I have sought for him in vain, and missed him, except for one fleeting moment, when I beheld him pass before me in the moon light under circumstances which forbade me reaching him.\" Grief and surprise were depicted upon the coun tenance of Lady Castleneau ; but what she would have replied to these words from Edith, or what questions she would have pressed her with, were put an abrupt stop to by an announcement from old Anthony. \" The Earl of Bridgewater, my lady I A more welcome visitor than the gallant young Earl to Castleneau House, could not weU be; and \" Indeed it is true, my lady, and Lady Castle ueau wUl soon be down in the breakfast-room ;"], [156, "150 EDITH HERON.

L'uder all these circumstances, a Privy Council warrant was issued for his apprehension, and he fled.\" \" Fled ?

It was impossible tbat either he or I could know the amount of evidence that might ba suborned against him; and by my advice he fltd, in order that I might have time in his absence, without being perplexed by considerations for his personal safety, to unravel the infamous plot that had been formed against him.

But let ma, since I have clone this mischief, repair it in my own way and in my own fashion.\" Both Lady Castleneau and the Eurl of Bridge water felt that Edith had a perfect right to dictate these terms to them, and they at once bowed to her decision. Stepping, then, forward, nith all that frankness and chivalric gallantry which so well became him, and formed so important a part of his cha racter, he toek Edith's ha_d, as he exclaimed, \"No, by heaven! let circumstances appear what they may, I will rather believe that rivers turn back upon their course, and that the bright sun shall rise at midnight, than that you, Euith, are other than truth and purity itself !\" Edith could not speak \u2014 her emotion prevented her. But Lady Castleneau, as she looked with grateful affection into the face of the young Earl replied for her. \"You are right, Bridgewatsr! Our Edith is truth and purity itself; but, along with those qualities, she cultivated, fora time, an indiscretion which has produced much misery. That, how ever, is now past, and she will tell you \u2014 or I will tell you \u2014 what is no longer to be made a secret of ; and that is, that tha person who was seen by Felix Heron at Whitcombe Honse, is none other than John Tarleton \u2014Edith's only brother ; and, what is most wofully worse \u2014 worse than all his conduct, disgraceful though it be, \u2014 in him she discovered the real assassin of Felix's father, the late Earl of Whitcombe! You now under stand all ?\" \" 1 do. indeed !\" exclaimed Bridgewater. \"And well do I remember the solemn manner in which Whitcombe made a vow, which he truly meant to be registered in heaven, that let him meet that murderer \u2014 that assassin where he might he would, without appealing to human laws, or human tribunals, exact of him a terrible retribution!\" Of course, Lady Castleneau was somewhat anxious to know in what way Elith meant to carry out her determination of seeking Felix, and then Edith made a singular request of her aunt \" Trust me,\" she said, \"as you have often and ever trusted me, for a space of time, dear aunt which I will make as short as possible. Let me be, even to you, secret and mysterious, \u2014 believe that I love you with as dear an affection as it is pos sible to feel for one who has been to mo both as a mother and a friend ; and believe that in making this request of you, 1 am actiog for the beet and that I shaU be aU tha happier if it be ac ceded to\" \" Yes,\" said Edith, tearfully ; \" that was it ! \u2014 that was it!\" \" A life for a life !\" \" Oh, yes ! I saw, in imagination, my husband's sword, red with the blood of my brother; and I saw, further still, the remorse which, when pas sion had died away with its own gratification, would come over the heart of Felix for the deed. I thought by gold, to tempt John Tarleton to fly ; but that but gave him an appetite for more, and so ensued all this misery.\" \" It is now over,\" said Bridgewater. \" Be mine the grateful and pleasant task to seek out my friend Whitcooibe, and explaiu all this to him.\" '\u25a0 But why,\" asked Lady Castleneau, \" has he fled from bis own house? Why has he left us all, and gone, we scarcely know whither \u2014 for saking his peerage, his position, his name, and his wife ?\" \" You have but to make it my dear Edith,\" re plied Lady Castleneau ; \" and I have but one re mark to make, my child, in promising what you wish.\" \" Oh, aunt ! I think I c_.n almost guess the re mark !\" \" Perhaps you can \u2014 and it is just this: that already you have found tbe evil consequences of secrecy, mystery, and disingenuousnees.\" This sounded something like a reproof, which Edith, upon general principles, could not but ac knowledge the justice of; bnt she resolved to beai it as best she might because her sole motive in dealing thus disingenuously with her aunt, was to spare her many an hour of uneasiness. It was Edith's intention to seek Felix Heron in the wood, on the road, and on the heath. She wished to be tbe guardian genius \u2014 tha protecting angel \u2014 ever at hand to stand between him and danger. And in addition to that, she had a strange romantio wish that the time should come when, without explanation at, all, Felix Huron should call alond upon her name, and, say that he be lieved in her innocence and her purity, despite \" Ah Lady Castleneau ! is it possible that you are not aware to some extent, of what has hap pened? I came, to tell y*u the exact truth, fear ing lest some misstatement might be made to you. By some means \u2014 I can scarcely tell you what \u2014 a violent prejudice has arisen in the King's mind against Felix Heron. His Majesty is quite per suaded by some about him that Heron engaged in Jacobinical practices, and that he never forsook what is called his life on the road; and it was industriously insinuated that under pretence of being a highwayman, he was, in reality, the principal agent in England of the exUed pre-"], [157, "151 EDITH HERON.

You gave him fifty pounds, and told him to take that boy, Tom Ripon, with him, and buy a horse with the money ; and they were away ever so long ; and there's quite a pretty, dark-coloured horse now in the stable along with the one yon carre on ; and Tom has been giving it some of the best bottled ale, and jams and sweetmeats, aU the after noon.\" And yet there must have been a something at the bottom of Edith's heart which whispered to her that, although this might be the most romantio eourse for her to pursue, it was not the wisest But be this as it may, she had determined upon it; and on that evening, after Lady Castleneau had retired to rest \u2014 believing, too, that she, Edith, was a .out to seek repose in the blue room \u2014 she might have been observed holding an anxious conferenoe with Martha, her aunt's waiting-maid. It was a conference that terrified the kind hearted and faithful servant because Edith was stating a determination which would not be con quered. \" My aunt retires to rest at an hour not later than nine,\" said Edith; \"and at that hour, each evening, I shall repair to this chamber : but, instead of retiring for the night it is my inten tion to equip myself in that apparel you saw lying upon the chair this morning.\" \" Oh, gracious, my lady, do not do so !\" \" It is decided, Martha ! You may help me, or help me not; but, whether or no, I rely upon your affection for me to keep my seoret.\" \" Oh, but, my lady, what do you mean to do?\" \" That is well ! Now go and tell Anthony I want to speak to him.\" \" Here, my lady ?\" \"Yes\u2014 here!\" Martha was almost afraid to come near Edith when she was fully equipped in her mascuUne attire, and particularly when she saw her put the two pistols into her pocket The idea that pistols of all kinds and descrip tions had a tendency to go off qnite of their own accord, and as capriciously as possible, was one of Martha's fixed notions. No wonder, then, that she now looked upon poor Edith as a kind of walking bombshell, that might explode at any moment, and possibly shoot any body in the house off-hand, and at once. It was, therefore, rather pleasing to her to get out of the way on this errand to old Anthony. The ancient serving-man was not likely to be very long in obeying any summons from Edith ; and he was soon at tha door, smoothing down his white locks with one hand, while he presented to her with the other a biU and receipt for the horse he had purchased with the fifty pounds she had given him for that purpose. \"My good Anthony,\" said Edith, \"I feel sure that you wiU do me a favour?\" \" Ask my life, dear Lady Edith, and it is \" Seek my husband 1\" \" The Earl, madam ? \" Yes ! It has seemed so him right and good to put off his state and dignity, and seek again com panionship among those who for a leng time followed him as their master and leader. I, too, intend to follow him, but in silence and secrecy; and who knows bnt kind heaven may place it in my power to save, perhaps, the lffe I once blessed, but have now, unhappily, partially embittered ? That would be a joy, indeed, re paying me for many sorrows; and if I should lie in his defence, he will accord to my memory iis regrets and my justification.\" Martha began to cry. yours.\" \" No, no ! I will rather risk my own to pre serve yours. But the favour I have to ask of you is one that Martha has already kindly granted to me. It is that you will not inform my dear aunt tbat I leave this house at night in search of one who is dearer to me still?\" CHAPTER LIV. <_DITH, WITH TOM BIPON, STARTS ON HEB FIRST EXPEDITION TO BLACKHEATH, THROUGH A THUNDER-STORM. \"Is that aU?\" \" Yes, Anthony, that is all \" \" Ah, dear Edith ! I will, indeed, keep your counsel, and you shaU take with you my prayers for your safety and success.\" \" A thousand thanks ! Now I go with a lighter heart Bid Tom attend me in the court yard.\" In five minutes Tom Ripon and Edith were both in the court in front of Castleneau House, and mounted for the road. A few drops of rain feU at that moment Lady Castleneau's confidential and much prized servant, Martha, was kind- hearted, bnt she had the misfortune to be weak-hearted as weU. At the idea of Edith going forth at such a time of night, and in such a costume as she proposed to wear, Martha was both afflicted and terrified. \" Oh, my lady, do not ! Oh, do not think of it ! Sou will be murdered, to a certainty; and then what shall I do or say ? \" Nothing, Martha.\" \" But dear my lady, won't your aunt naturally say it was all my fault to let you go ?\" \" No, my good Martha, she wUl not say so, for a very sufficient reason.\" \" What reason, my lady ?\" \" Just that you cannot help me going, since I have the will to do so!\" Tom was delighted. What was rain, hail, frost, or thunder to hiir now? Had he not actually a home of his own ? Was he not, indeed, a man now that he rode by the side of Edith, the Countess of Whitcombe; and she thought him worthy of being her com panion and her protector on the heath, the road, or in the wood ? To be sure he was ! But there was one thing still wanting to Tom's complete felicity, and that exemplified the saying that \" Man never is, but always to be blessed.\" Martha then saw that it was quite useless to contend with Edith upon the subject any longer. As she had a real and genuine affection for her \u2014 and, moreover, thought her the most wise and clever person on the face of the earth \u2014 she said no Pistols !

Consequently, Tom Eipon was without arms. \" Miss Edith, Miss Edith, what shaU I do ?\" \" As regards what, Tom?\" \" I want pistols!\" \"We shall, perhaps, manage to supply that want, Tom, as we go along. I am not without money ; and I will not leave you long unarmed, you may depend!\" With this promise, Tom Ripon was fain to be satisfied ; and he and Edith rode together out of the court-yard of old Castleneau House, just as the clouds began to thicken and give promise of a tempestuous evening. \" We shall have a storm,\" said Edith. \" It looks like it, Miss Edith. But touching those pistols, I have an idea !\" \"What is it?\" alarm. Tom's was much the steadier creature of the two, as it turned out. \"Miss Edith,\" said Tom, \" we shall have to change horses, I see ; but, in the meantime, let a fellow advise tbat we get into some shelter, for, in a few minutes, won't it rain like cats and dogs !\" \" What shelter can we find here, Tom ?\" asked Edith, somewhat anxiously. \" Oh ! there is the old ' Angel Inn,' just a sow doors down to the right, by the market here; and we can easily ride in there, and no one will take any notice of us to speak of.\" \" Lead the way, then, Tom. Be it so.\" Edith had put on a cloak on leaving Lady Cas tleneau's house; and it was well that she had done so, for it not only concealed, in a great measure, the costume she wore, but acted as something like a defence against changes in the weather. As Tom had said, the old \" Angel Inn\" was close at hand ; and, in fact, any one who is curious in regard to the localities of this history, may see it still ; for, notwithstanding all the changes and visitations of time aud circumstances which have converted London into quite a different place about that neighbourhood, there still is to be found the old \" Angel Inn \" yard. Perhaps it is a little modernised ; and, probably, since Fleet Market has been swept away, its visitors are of a different character to what they were a hundred years ago ; but certainly among the antiquities of LondoD, of a domestic charac ter, these old inn-yards remain the most unique. As Tom bad predicted, the rain began to fall in torrents as he and Edith rode in under the old archway \u2014 for it was old then. \" The first person we cry, ' Stand !' to on the highway, I propose that we say, ' Your pistols or your life !' instead of ' Your money or your life !' and they will be glad, you see, Miss Edith, to get off so cheaply.\" \"What, Tom? Do you imagine that lam about to turn a highway robber?\" \"Eh?\" \" Can it be possible, I say, Tom Ripon, that you ever had such a thought ?\" Tom looked confounded. All his ideas were in a state of confusion, consequent upon these few words from Edith. It was some few moments before he could find breath with which to reply to her, and then it was only in a stammering kind of way. \" I \u2014 I thought \u2014 no \u2014 that is, I didn't exactly think \u2014 but, you see, Miss Edith, in course, I had an idea that I didu't think I thought anything at all.\" There was plenty of space for them ; for, be yond a few carts, with their shafts lifted high up into the air, and one huge waggon, piled high up with hay and straw, the j'ard was unoccupied. From the various sounds, however, that came from the different stables, it was evident that numerous horses were put up there ; and the steed of Edith, as well as that of Tom Eipon, seemed not a little pleased to get out of the rain. They rode nearly to the further end of the inn-yard ; and then, facing the entrance, they looked at the storm. \" Just so, Tom.\" \" You quite understand, now, Miss Edith ?\" \" Nothing can be plainer.\" \"Well, I'm glad of that,\" thought Tom, \"for I'm blest if I can understand it all; but I sup pose the Lady Edith has had a superior educa tion, and understands what I don't.\" Tom Eipon was sadly put out, though, for all that ; and when they got down Holborn, to what was then called Holborn Bridge \u2014 that is to say, to the corner of old Fleet Market \u2014 he made bold to say, \" Miss Edith, would you mind telling a chap where we are going ?\" \" I have no objection in the world. We are going over the bridge here, at Blackfriars, and so on to Blackheath.\" The rain poured in impetuous torrents along the channels of the market, and ever and anon the lightning lit up, with a new and lurid bright ness, the houses on the opposite side of the way and a portion of the wall of old Fleet Prison, which they could just see. The down-pour of rain seemed to have extin guished the few oil-lamps which were about the 6pot, and the only light in the inn-yard was the stable lantern, hung upon one of the numerous doors leading to the stables, barns, and granaries. The storm was brief, though terrific. It was the fast down-pouring shower which seemed to wash it away. \" It gets lighter, Miss Edith,\" said Tom Ripon. \" I think it does, Tom.\" \" Then,\" cried Tom, with exultation in his tones, \" we shall meet the Captain, of course ?\" \" I hope so, Tom.\" \"Bravo! bravo! That will do! Hilloa! What's that ?\" A peal of thunder at this moment rattled over London ; and both the horses stopped short, for a moment or two, in evident alarm. \" I expected this,\" said Tom. \" We shall have a storm, Miss Edith. I advise that we put up for a little while, until it has blown over, which it won't be long in doing. My eye! there's a flash!\" \" Our ride will be all the pleasanter to Black heath ; but there seems a shift of wind, for the rain beats in as it did not beat before. A bewildering flash of blue, forked lightning lit jp the whole neighbourhood ; and scarcely was it seen, before it was followed by another peal of thunder of a more startling nature than the last Tom had hardly made this remark when a foot-passenger, drenched apparently to tho skin by the fast-descending shower, turned into the inn-yard for shelter."], [159, "EDITH HERON. 153 St. Paul's clock at that moment struck the hour They did not seem to concern them in the least; and all they expected to gather from them was that this man was not exactly a chance passenger who had turned into the inn-yard out of the rain' but that ha had an appointment there with some one at the hour of ten o'clock. of twelve. The archway ef the old inn-yard had, probably, some capacity of conducting sound; for although this foot passenger spoke in a low tone, as if com- muning only with himself, what he said came clearly and distkctly to the ears of both Edith and Tom Ripon. \" He dare not play me false, \"said the passenger. \" It is ten o'clock now, and he must be here quickly. If ever there was a night fitted for my purpose, this is it. I don't see why I shouldn't rid the world, and myself at the same time, of the greatest ruffian it ever looked upon. What will then hin- der me of the earldom ? Who shall say that I am not the representative of the younger branch of the Whitcombes, and surely a mnch more respectable one than Jonath.n Wild, the thief taker?\" That hour which had just been boomed forth by the sonorous beU of St Paul's. But when he =o\u00abke of the earldom of Whitcombe and of Jonathan WUd, both Edith and Tom Ripon started ; for they were interesting names to them. Not for long, h.wever, had they to consider who this person could be, aud what his words might mean; for another appearance took p'ace at the entrance gate of the old inn, which filled them with surprise. Two bearers appeared, carrying a sedan chair through all the pelting rain ; and carrying it, too, as quietly and compisedly as though tha night had been as fine a one as ever shone oat of the heavens. These words at first bad produced no particular impression upon Ediih or Tom Eipon. No 20.- Edith."], [160, "154 EDITH HERON. These two men, who looked like common, ordi nary chairmen, turned into the inn-yard in such a natural manner, that it was easy to suppose that place was their destination. \" What can aU this mean, Tom ?\" whispered Edith. strange, although it will not be so to tha render who will recognise it as tho name of tha attorney in the Temple with whom Jonathan Wild had found a refuge after his escape from the vault in Westminster Abbey. It ws Boom who now spoke, after a silence of some few seconds, and his voice had a strange in tonation about it as he did so. \" I can't for the life of me, think.\" \" Who is this stranger who speaks familiarly of the earldom of Whitcombe and of Jonathan Wild, but whose voice is quite unknown to me ?\" \" It's unknown to me, too,\" replied Tom, in the same tone ; \" but it strikes me if we wait patiently, Miss Edith, we shall know a little more; and, for my part I'm quite as curious to find out who is in that sedan chair.\" \" Do you really mean to say, Mr. Wild, that an ounce of lead more or less in your head makes no difference ?\" \"Not the least !\" groaned Wild, in the same ac cents of languid suffering, from, as Boon thought, the interior of the sedan chair. \" Then try that .'\" said the attorney, sharply. At the same moment, the loud report of a pistol rang throngh the inn-yard. There was a crash of glass, a splintering of wood-work, a loud yell of either fear or pain, and then Boom dor ed like a rocket out of the inn yard, towards the Fleet Market falling exactly into the arms of a couple of men who stood there waiting to reoeive him. One of these men popped a gag into his mouth. The other clapped a pair of handcuffs upon him, aud then seizing him on each side under his arms, they carried him back into the inn-yard with a celerity that showed they were well accustomed to the work they were about. In fact, these men were two of Jonathan Wild's most experienced aud resolute bull-dogs or janis saries, for he called them sometimes by one name and sometimes by the other. They were the two men who had played the part of chairmen but a short time before ; and now they set down upon bis feet the terrified and be wildered Mr. Boom, exactly opposite to the shat tered window of the sedan chair, and waited for further orders. \" Hush I They speak again.\" The bearers of the sedan chair had brought it right into the inn-yard, and placing it down in a position where the rays from the stable lantern penetrated but faintly, they seemed to wait in silence for some question or movement from the man who had first arrived on foot. \"Who is there?\" he said. \"My name begins with a B.\" \" And mine with a W\" replied a voice ap parently from the sedan chair, but in such a hideous, groaning fashion, that it was fearful to hear it. \" Then,\" said the first stranger, \" you have kept the appointment I made by letter with you at your house in Newgate Street; and, although I cannot see you in the confounded darkness of this place, I may know that I am addressing Mr. Wild ?\" \" Jonathan Wild,\" growled the voice from the sedan, in the same hideous accents. \" What makes you speak so stiaugely ?\" \"Because, my dear Boom, I have been half murdered ; and, if I were not what I am, and who I am, I should have been wholly murdered ; and, as it is, I have a shrewd suspicion \" \" A suspicion ? \u2014 of what ? ' \" That there is a bullet \" A bent-up figure, supporting itself on two sticks, crept slowly round the sedan chair ; and giving Boom a poke in the stomach with the end of one of the sticks, that must have been anything but agreeable, Jonathan WUd, for he it was, spoke. \" Ha ! ha ! So you would set up your wit against ma, Mr. Boom ! Idiot ! did you think your shallow cunning was a match for Jonathan Wild? Ha! ha! you will swing. Boom \u2014 swing at Tyburn ! Take him along, bull-dogs \u2014 take him along! Put him in\u2014 let me see \u2014 yes, pu him in number four. Take him along. Our busi ness here is done to-night at the old Angel Inn 1\" Boom made frantic efforts to speak, but the gag effectually prevented him, and Jonathan Wild's men, without a word, hurried the wretched at torney from the place, heedless of the wind and rain which howled and pattered without. \" Good night !\" said Wild, os he now struck the sedan chair on the roof a sharp crack with one of his sticks. \" Good night, blatant ass ! I have done with you, and you have been a great deal more useful in your death than iu your life.\" Wild was really in a serious state of decrepitude. The adventure in the lane ou the last occasion of his encountering Tom Ripon and Edith had been of a nature to attack oven his iron frame. There was, therefore, no affectation in the way that he hobbled out of the inn-yard, and took his route towards his own house, where, by this time, he was fairly restored again in all his old power and authority. A strange noise came from the interior of the sedan chair. \" A bullet ? Where ?\u2014 where ?\" \" Now in my head !\" \" You cannot mean that, Mr. Wild ?\" \" I do mean it ! But an ounce of lead, more or less, I am not particular about !\" \"In good truth, Mr. Wild, I'm glad to hoar it!\" \" Then tell me why it is that, suffering as I am, you have brought me here ? Tell me why it is, Boom, that I could not visit you, as usual, at your chambers in the Temple?\" \" That is j ust what I want to tell you, Mr. Wild. Something important has happened ; and so important that I wish to relate it to your ear alone.\" \" The inn-yard is dear. An hour ago, I sent the people a hint that whatever they heard, and whatever they saw, between ten and eleven o'clock, was nothing to them. They know me, and have cleared away accordingly.\" \" But the two chairmen, Mr. Wild ?\" \"They will go.\" Wild blew a short sharp whistle, and the two chairmen immediately left the ion-yard. Edith would have given worlds, had she pos sessed them, at that moment to be out of that place, and beneath the free, open _ky. Each moment she feared that either her horse or Tom Ripon's would make some movement that would betray their presence ; although no casual glance, far back as they were in the darkness of the inn-yard, would bo sufficient to observe them.

Who said Mortification ? I'm a miserable sinner, but I never was so miser able a sinner as I am just now. Oh, dear !\" Edith, despile aU that she had to banish smiles from her face, could not help according one to this unexpected appearance of the Rev. Mortification Ripon. \" Tom, Tom ! it is, indeed, the man who caUs himself your father-in-law.\" \" To be sure it is,\" said Tom ; \" but I think it wiU be just as well, Miss Edith, that he don't see ns. His eyes are covered over with a bandage, but I don't think he is hurt in the least, though I do fancy Jonathan Wild has gone off in the idea that he has been shot in his place \" \" You are right, Tom,\" whispered Edith. \" That is the true explanation of the whole affair. Jonathan Wild has had a rendezvous with some one here from whom he expected assassination, and he has made this wretched Mortification Ripon, as he chooses to name himself, his substitute.\" \"Eh? What?\" cried the Rev. Mortification. \" Eh ? What\u2014 what do you say ? I hear a whispering ! I'm a dead man ! Watch ! Con stables ! Have mercy upon a wretched creature. What does the Psalmist say ? Bother the Psalmist ! I don't want to go to glory ! Help ! help ! Watch !\" \" Come away,\" whispered Edith ; \" we have nothing to say to this man.\" \" In a minute, Lady Edith.\" Tom Ripon conld not make up his mind to leave the Rev. Mortification quite so easily, as he had a full appreciation of the treachery of his character. Approaching him, Tom assumed a feigned voice, and said, hoarsely, \" Mortification ! Mortification ! 0 Mortification !\" \"Lady Edith \u2014 Lady Edith, it's a thousand pities \" Tom stopped short then. \"What is a thousand pities, Tom?\" \" That we let Jonathan go. Oh, what a chance ! What a chance, Lady Edith ! We shall never, oh, no, never have the like again !\" Perhaps Edith was of the same opinion as Tom Ripon in regard to never having snch a chance again\u2014 a chance of getting rid of Jonathan Wild once and for aU, by one well-directed shot which might do its work as effectually as Mr. Boom had hoped to do it, but had so mysteriouily and so signally failed in. But she shook her head. \" No, Tom, no ! It would be contrary to our feelings and onr interests. We could not have done it.\" \" Well,\" said Tom, \" I don't know that It ap pears to me we could not have missed him.\" Tom evidently thought that Edith meant there wonld have been some difficislty in killing WUd with a bullet from the back of the old inn-j ard. But the mysterious noises from the interior of the sedan chair still continued. They challenged aU the attention of Edith and of Tom Ripon. Who could be there who either wUlingly or by force had been made to play the part of Jonathan Wild so far as Mr. Boom was concerned, and had suffered for his pains ? This was a question which was likely to excite the liveliest curiosity of both Tom Ripon and Edith, but still the latter felt the necessity cf leav ing the inn-yard as soon as possible, since there were two possibilities which now might make it an unsafe place to stay in. The people of the inn themselves might make an appearance, and chaUengethe two strangers as regarded the deed of blood that seemed to have been committed in the sedan chair. \" That's me ! Who are you ? \" \"Affliction!\" \" What ?\" \" Affliction. You are Mortification, and I am Affliction.\" \" Oh, weU ! I don't mind.\" \" Having been shot in mistake for Mr. Jonathan WUd, you are now a dead man !\" \" Who ? Me ? Was I shot ? I didn't feel it Murder I Am I a dead man ? My hands are tied behind my back, and there's a thick roUed-up towel over my eyes. How can I be a dead man ? Eh? Watch! I call on the watch! Help! Murder !\" Or Jonathan Wild might return. In either case, Edith felt that it would be but a wise thin g to leave that place as quickly as pos sible. \"Tom,\" she said \u2014 \"Tom, it is nothing to us what has happened. Let us leave this place ot once. The wind and the rain are far less to be dreaded than what may still happen here.\" \" One look 1\" said Tom. \" You are now,\" added Tom, \" where you always had a right to expect to go to.\" \"No, no!

Mortification, so that the whole contents poured over him, and the pail remained on his head like some eccentric- shaped modern helmet Then he spoke feebly. \" What do you want with me ? What have I done to you ? Can't you let me go ?\" \"No.\" \" Oh, weU, my dear sir, if you can't let me go, perhaps you will teU me what I have done to\u2014 to \u2014 make you keep me here ?\" \" That's what I want to know.\" \" What \u2014 you \u2014 want \u2014 to \u2014 know?\" \u25a0 \" Exactly. The Captain chooses to keep you here, and I should like to know why ; and to begin with, wha.'a your name ?\" \" My name?\" \" I said, jour name.\" \" Oh, my name's Deuce Ace.\" Ogle shook his head. \" Stuff ! No man's name is Deuce Ace. You have some other name than that, I am quite sure, so what is it? Oat with ii at once!\" \" It is Jack\u2014 Jack D. u.c Ace. That is the only name I have to give you.\" \" That will do,\" said Tom. \" Now, Lady Edith, let's be off. 1 don't think ha will forget this hour as long as ha lives.\" The Eev. Mortification was so astounded at the shower bath and the descent of the paU upon his head, that he said not one word, but sat in the sedan chair presenting a most ludicrous spectacle. Edith cast but one glance around her, and then followed Tom Ripon from the inn-yard, which bhe w\u00abs glad enough to leave. The rain still fell but the violence of the squall had passed away, and there were rifts in the sky which promised a clear night, after all ; while the cool, fr;sh feel of the atmosphere amply compen sated for the temporary inconvenience of the shower. \"Now, Tom,\" said Edith, \"to Blackheath, since it is there you tell me Felix wiU be found. Lot us take that direction at cnce.\" \" Over the bridge, then,\" said Tom, \" and off we go !\" \" Well, I suppose you have good reasons for your concealment of any other; so, Mr. Jack Deuce Ace, I want to know what brought you here ?\" CHAPTER LV.

Why, I may as well make an and of jou at once!\" To the intense terror of John Tarleton, Ogla took a pistol from his pocket, and prepared it lor action. JOHN TARLETON, ALIAS MR DEUCE ACE, FINDS HIS SITUATION AT THE CASTLE IRKSOME IN THE EXTR1MB, AND 1FFECTS A TABTIAL ESCAPE. The situation of John Tarleton in the old castle on Shooter's Hill was anything but a pleasant one. Ogle had taken good care that he should be placed insecurity; and the apartment, on tbe ground floor, which was his temporary pii_.oo, was by no means a very tempting place of abode In truth, it was a room which, t-veu when the building had been fully inhabited aud rendered cheerful by continued cccupation, had been devoted totbe reception of lumber. But probably ot all the lumber which from time to time had found a place in it, none had been so utterly useless as John Tarleton. He raved, and cursed, and swore for the greater part as the night \"No, no !\" cried Tarleton \" Stop, stop ! and I will tell you all you can possibly want to know.\" \" As regards that\" returned Ogle, \" you must let me be the judge; so I ask you again, Mr. Jack Deuce Ace, what brought you here?\" \" I came to see the White Highwayman.\" \"Oh, you did, did jou? And pray how long have you known that person?\" \" I don't know him at all.\" \" And yet you came here to seek him ! Be so good as to explain all that if you please.\" \" I will. I am rather fond of cards, and now and then I rather like dice.\" He declaimed at his own folly, as he called it which had inductd him to lifcten for ha.f a moment to the representations of such a man as La Jeuue, whom he ki_ew as Captain Target There in the darkness, for the place was vary dark indeed, he made various efforts to escape from the dungeon-like room. But that was a vain hope. His hands were manacled. \" A gambler?\" \" Well, jou may call it gambling. Sometimes I win, but a good deal of tener I lose.\" \" That's what has always bothered me,\" said Ogle, with a puzzled look. \" What does become of all the money that is lost at the gaming tables, for everybody seems to loie everything sooner or later?\" * Well, it is odd,\" added John Tarleton. \" But as I was saying, I oftener lost; and as that hap pened only a little time ago, I took the advice of a man who goes to the same house in the gaming line that 1 do in London, aud he told me to come down here and join the White Highwayman ; and I came, and you nabbed me. bo now you know as mnch as I do.\" Ogle was too expert in such matters to leave John Tarleton the ghost of a chance of getting away from the prison he had prepared for him And so at length, fatigued and txhausted, and qnite despairing, the villain who had caused so much uneasiness to Edith, and bn-n such a bane to the life and happiness both of Felix Heron and his sister, fell asleep. It was a not over gentle kick at his legs that awakened him. John Tarleton sat np. He thought he had only just closed his eyes ; but to his surprise he saw lhat it was broad daylight and thatalongBtraight ray of sunshine came into the lumber room which Was his prison. \" Not quite.\" \" What more ?\" \" I must and wUl know who and what you are?\" \" What is that to you?\" \" It is everything to me, I tell jou ; and there is one here whose Ule is more precious to me ;l_it._"], [163, "EDITH HERON. 157 my own, and who may be generous enough, on tome impulse of a moment, to let you go. So I am tesolved I will know all about you before that can possibility happen.\" \" And if I refuse ?\" And so Ogle was quite resolved that he would not part with John Tarleton until, by fair means or foul, he had got from him all the information likely to lead to some satisfactory explanations. That fair means, with such a man, would utterly fail, Ogle had a fuU apprehension ; so he made up his mind not to waste perhaps precious time by trying them. He produced his pocket-pistol again. He flung up the pan, and carefully settled the powder about the touch-hole. He shut down the pan again with a snap. Then shutting one eye, Ogle looked with the other along an imaginary Une right into the face of John Tarleton. \" An accident will happen.\" \" An accident ? What accident ?\" \" Why, a bullet wUl be going along very fast in this room ; and your head will, accidentally and very stupidly I wiU own, come in the way of it and get most decidedly the worst of it\" John Tarleton became pale. \" You mean murder ?\" \" If I do, I suspect I mean no more than a fellow like you is possibly enough familiar with by his own acts. But I waste time. Do you look out for yourself.\" Ogle held the pistol in such a threatening man ner towards the head of John Tarleton, that the latter felt his existence depended upon the slight est touch of the trigger. \" Hold ! hold!\" he cried. \" Be quick, and remove the pistol from the line of my eyes, and I will tell yon all you want to know.\" \" Good ! Be quick !\" \" My name, then, as you suppose, is not Jack Deuce Ace.\" Along that line he presented the pistol. John Tarleton uttered a shout of alarm. He thought that death was close at hand. \" What's the matter, man ?\" asked Ogle, with aU the composure in the world. \"Don't! don't!\" \" Don't what ?\" \" Don't kUl a fellow in cold blood in this way ! What have I done ? What have I said, that you should do so ?\" \" You have said too much or too Uttle.\" \" I don't comprehend you.\" \" Then I beg to tell you that there is but one solitary chance left you of saving your life ; and that is by making a clean breast of all you have done, and of all you know that \u2014 that \" \"That what?\" Ogle made a gesture of impatience. \" But it is John \" \"John what?\" \" Tarleton !\" Ogle placed one hand upon his brow as he re peated to himself, \" Tarleton ! Tarleton ! Oh, yes, yes ! Now I know !\" \" You know what ?\" \" That may concern the Earl and Countess of Whitcombe.\" \"I will, I will. But I don't see what it can pos sibly matter. I have, of course, made np my mind to go to Whitcombe House bo more, or I should not be here, I can tell you.\" \" Oh! To go to Whitcombe House no more ?\" \" I said so.\" \" That that is the same name as that old rascal Sir John Tarleton, the judge, who is now dead, a^d gone to Well, well ! it is not necessary to say where he has gone to\" \" You may say it if you like. He was my father.\" \"Then yon have been there?\" \" I have\" \"What?\" \" I say he was my father !\" \"Sir John Tarleton ? Old Judge Tarleton your father?\" \" When? when?\" \" Oh, lately enough.\" \" And what did you go for ? who did you see.?\" \" My sister Edith. H you must know aU, I wanted money ; and as she was the wife of a great, grand, rich nobleman, who conld not possibly miss a few hundreds now and then, I went to ask them of her.\" \"Just so!\" \" Then \u2014 then you are the brother of the Countess of Whitcombe, who was Edith Tarleton ?\" \"That's it!\" \" Good gracious !\" \" What can all that be to you ? What do you know about Edith Tarleton, my sister, who is now the Countess of Whitcombe, eh ?\" \" Gracious heaven !\" \" Well, go on.\" \" She gave them to me, and she was in a terrible fright for fear her husband should know of it\" Ogle shook his head. \"No. Now you are lying,\" he said. \"Now I shall be compeUed to shoot you for lying.\" \" No, no ; it is true \u2014 true as the Gospel, I teU you. I found ont a secret way to get into the house by the stables, and so to the private rooms of the Earl and the Countess ; and there, by good luck, I met her, and more than once she supplied me with money.\" \" Secretly, and quite unknown to the Earl?\" \" Just so,\" \" It is not like her ! It is not like her ! No, no, no ! There is yet a something more to know.\" John Tarleton was silent \" What do you mean, I say ? What do you mean ? What can it be to you who or what I am?\" \" Hush !\" \"Hushl Why hush?\" \" Let me think.\" ' Ogle rested his head on his hands for a few mo ments, and reflected. He knew that he had heard something about this John Tarleton somewhere, but he could not recollect exactly where ; though there was a strong impression on his mind that the fellow was the cause of some of the distress that at the then present time beset the Earl aud the Countess of Whitcombe. The fact was that, as the reader is well aware, there was a something more to know ; and that something was the real reason why Edith had con cealed the visit of John Tarleton to Whitcombe House from her husband- Ogle could not put together in his own mind v. ry well all the fragments! information be pos sessed on the subject ; but each moment his con viction that he was on the right scent for a solu tion of some of the mysteries which had had the effect of estranging, for the present, Edith from Captain Heron, grew stronger in his mind. It said a good deal for Ogle's appreciation of the character of Edith that he should at once be able to judge her so weU as to say to him-"], [164, "158 EDITH HERON. self that ihe conld not have acted as she did simply for the reason that John Tarleton had given. Because she wished to supply her brother with money. \" I fully and entirely believe what you have now told me,\" he said. \" I'm glad you do.\" \" Are you ? Well, I would not proclaim myself such a villain for the orown of England !\" \" But I tell yon I am not going to Whitcombe Honse any more. You won't catch me there again after the fright I had ' \"Fright? What fright?\" \" Why, the last time I went to see my sister Edith, and get some little help from her, who should I meet but the Earl himself!\" \" No, no, no !\" said Ogle. John Tarleton felt and knew that he had not told the whole truth. But Ogle was resolved not to be baffled. Of course he could not say to a perfect certainty that his prisoner had anything else to tell him, but he suspected it. And the suspicion was so strong that he was resolved to go to any lengths, short of actual kUling, to get at the truth- Stepping close up to John Tarleton, he clapped the cold, uncomfortable muzzle of the pistol to his forehead, as he said, \" You are a dead roan in another two minutes, if you do not tell me the real reason why Edith\u2014 that is to say, the Countess of Whitcombe \u2014 was so anxious to keep secret from tho Earl, her husband, your visits to Whit combe House.\" \" Indeed !\" , \" Yes ; and he sent a shot after me, which I feel singing in my ears ever since, and which I can hardly persuade myself, at times, is not lodged in my head, although, of course, it must have missed me.\" \" Wrelch ! \" \" What do you mean ?\" \" Wretch, I say ; did it never occur to you that you might be doing your innocent sister the greatest possible mischief? Did it not strike you that you might make so much disaster for her, that even a separation might take place between her and the Earl, her husband?\" \" Oh, I had nothiog to do with that. I wanted money, aud I was bound to get it somehow.\" Ogle felt that should he remain any louger with John Tarleton ho might not bo able to control himself sufficiently to hinder himself from doing some injury to the villain, so he abruptly left the room. \" Spare me ! I have told all.\" \" I don't think so. I will give you five more seconds.\" \"What for?\" \" For Ufe. If you do not tell me within that time, I will fire !\" \" Murder ! murder !\" \" One \u2014 two \u2014 three\u2014 four \" \u00ab Help ! Oh, help !\" \" Five \u2014 six \u2014 seven \u2014 eight \u2014 nine \" \" I will tell.\" \" Very good \u2014 what was it?\" \" I \u2014 I \u2014 had been to \u2014 to Whitcombe House But Ogle took good care to secure the donr. Joha Tarleton was by far too important a prisoner to part with easily. \" Now,\" said Ogle to himself, as he ran along a dark passage, and struggled up an equally dam staircase, \u2014 \" now I will find out the Captain, and he shall know all about it at once; and ail we shall have to do will be to find out tha Lady Eiliih, and thtn they will both be as happy again os tho day is long. And who knows but we may aU of us go back to old Epping Forest again, whioh the Captain and Lady Edith left in an evil day? And (hen won't that be jolly ! Yes, I will tell him at once all that I his rascally brother of Edith has said and done; and how be killed the old Earl, and how he then frightened Edith, all on account of tha vow tbe Captain had made to take the life of the murderer of his father as soon as he could catch him ; and how, as that murderer was poor Edith's own brother, it would break her heart for her husband to be the Ah ! oh !\" before; and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 it was I \u2014 who \u2014 had tha misfortune to kill an old gentleman on the grand staircase, who turned out to be the old Earl of Whitcombe. And as it appeared that ihe present Earl had made a sort of oath or vow that he would take the life of tho \u2014 a \u2014 person whom he called the murderer of his father, wherever and whenever he should see him, my sister Edith was afraid to say a word about me to him. That was the. reason !\" \" Yes,\" said Ogle, with a deep sigh, as he put up his pistol, greatly to the relief of John Tarleton. \" Yes, that was the reason ; and I now can com prehend it all.\" \" And \u2014 and,\" added John Tarleton, \" now that I have made a clear breast of it, I think I am entitled to any favour that can be shown me.\" Ogle came to a stand-still. The colour fled from his face. CHAPTER LVL A cold perspiration stood upon his brow. \" What \u2014 what,\" he gasped, \u2014 \" what am I about to do? Ob, gracious!\" The thought had darted through his brain like a flash of light, tbat he was abou', by his precipi tancy, to do tho very thing which, rather than have done, Edith bad sacrificed her bome and almost her existence. CAPTAIN HERON CALLS UPON DAISY TO HELP HIM, AND MAKES A FLYING VISIT TO CASTLE NEAU HOUSE \u2014 A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Ogle was now by far too much immersed in his own reflections to pay any attention to John Tarleton for some few minutes. Paoing the room to and fro, he forgot that there was such a person in the world as his prisoner, from whom he had received so important a revelation. Her horror at the idea of her husband, her Felix taking the life of John Tarleton, her brother, as tha murderer of tho old Earl of Whitcombe, had been tho sole motive of her conduct It had alienated her from the heart which loved her so truly. It had shied her own breast with such pangs as might only bo faintly imagined. And now was he, Ogle, in a moment of thought lessness, to undo all that sho had done, and to tall Captain Heron that the opportunity of doiug ihe \"Poor Edith! Poor Edith!\" he ejaculated. \" Alts, poor Edith !\" John Tarleton, with aU ihe selfishness of his nature, was quite astonished at this emotion on tho part of Ogle for any one else ; and he followed him, doubting almost of bis sanity. Suddenly, then, Ogle confronted him."], [165, "159 EDITH HERON act which she had made such terrible self-sacrifices to prevent was at hand. The fact was, tbat the few words Heron had uttered had, for tho instant, chased away all the wise resolves and reasonings of Ogle, who only then remembered that he was in possession of ex actly the information for which the heart ef Felix Heron yearned. Bat as he spoke, the reasons for silence which ho had so satisfactorily propounded to himself came back again in full force. So he stopped abruptly. \" What, in the name of heaver, do you mean, Ogle?\" \"Mean, Captain! Mean! I \u2014 a\u2014 oh, I don't mean anything at all.\" \" Then your conduct is only the more extraor dinary still, Ogle.\" \" Yes, Captain, it is. That is to say, it might be ; but I don't mean anything except that I feel quite sure \u2014 that is to say, I know that the Lady Edith is as innocent as any young lamb.\" \"Alas! alas! And that is aU you have to say ?\" \" No \u2014 that is to say, yes.\" \" Ogle, I cannot understand you. You are, I know, a temperate man.\" \" Oh, yes, Captain! Believe me, I am: and as I have something very particular \u2014 that is, I mean nothing to say, I think I will leave yoa now. \" \"Stop!\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" I insist upon knowing what is the meaning of all this strangeness, Ogle.\" \" Yes, Captain. Oh, of course you ought to know. You \u2014 vou have a right to know. WeU \u2014 \u25a0 I\u2014 a Yes, Captain.\" \" Well, what is it ? Ah ! I guess.\" \" You do ? I hope you do.\" \" The other prisoner \" \" Yes\u2014 oh, yes !\" \" Has \" Those were the considerations that put poor Ogle into such a fright. He found that he was as much bound, for Edith's sake, now to keep the secret he had extorted from John Tarleton, as she had thought herself bound to keep it, on account of the ties of consanguinity that bound her to that selfish and most criminal brother. Ogle sat down on the top step of the staircase he had beon so rapidly ascending in search of Cap tain Heron, and groaned aloud. Never had he found himself in so painful a com plication. What to do he conld not think. For the first time since he had been fairly in the service of Captain Felix Heron, and had learnt to lock upon that service as part of his life itself, he found that he was in possession of a secret, which he, Haron, would have given half his life to know, and yet which considerations that he, Ogle, could not possibly disregard, prevented him from telling. How John Tarleton would have laughed to him self could he only have known all this ? \"No, no!\" said Ogl\u00ab; \"I must not \u2014 I dare not tell the Captain ! What would the Lidy Edith say to me if the Captain were, in consequence of what I told him, to go and kill that rascal who she has the misfortune to have for a brother ? Would she not say, ' Ogle, surely, after I had consented to sacrifice home, husband, love, reputation, all that I held dear in the world, rather than this terrib'e catastrophe should happen, it was not for you to bring it about !'\" The idea that poor Edith might say some such words to him quite unnerved Ogle. Ha let his head drop upon his hands, and tears came from his eyes. Tnen a hand was laid quietly upon his shoulder. A voice sounded in his ears. \" He has ! He has !\" \" Escaped 1\" It was the voice of Captain Heron. \" Ogle! Ogle, my good friend, what is this ?\" Ogle started to his feet. He dashed the tears from his eyes. \" Nothing \u2014 nothing, Captain ; only, you see, I \u2014 I was thinking \u2014 that is aU. It is nothing ; but just at that moment you see, Captain, it 03 curred to me that\u2014 that \u2014 nothing at all.\" \" It is not for me, my faithful friend,\" said Heron, \" to question you about what may affect you. but I was looking for you.\" \" Yes, Captain, here I am !\" \" Ogle, if\u2014 if \" \" H what Captain ?\" Heron appeared to be unable to go on for some few seconds, and when he did continue speaking it was in a voice broken by deep emotion. \" I was going to say, Ogle, that the recovery of my poor long lost mother, and the hope that I have of her perfect restoration to health, both of mind and body, has infused so much happiness into my heart, that if I could only arrive at some explanation of tbe cause of tha inexplicable con duct of\u2014 of \" Ogle staggered back ; and yet that one word from Captain Heron gave him an idea, and sug gested a mode of extricating himself from the very difficulties which surrounded him at that moment. Rapid as a lightning flash, the idea came into his head that if he were to lead Heron to think John Tarleton was gone, there would no longer be any danger in telling him all about the confession he had extorted from him. This idea was au immense relief to Ogle. It was sunlight amid all the darkness and con fusion into which his mind had been cast. No wonder then that he eagerly adopted so ready a mode of getting out of the difficulty. \" Tes, Captain,\" to said, \" you ought to blame me very much for carelessness, but the real truth is, I have let tho fellow go,\" \" Never mind, Ogle.\" \" You don't miud it, Captain ?\" \" Ob, no I We did not really want him, and should have been puzzled to know what to do with him. I fancy he was some rascaUy associate of Warringdale's.\" \" I think so too, Captain.\" \" So, my good friend Ogle, do not trouble your self any more about it. I am quie sure, too, that the circumstances must have been of some excep tional character.\" \" They were, Captain.\" \" Then, say no more about it.\" \"I won't\" \" That is right, Ogle ; and now be happy and pleased along with me, so far as concerns my poor mother, whom yonr wife is attending on.\" \"Edith!\" cried Ogle. \" Yes, of Edith\u2014 I should only be too, too much blessed !\" \" Hoorah ! hoorah !\" \"What? what?\" \"Hoorah, Captain ! I can tell you all about it ! I \u2014 I \u2014 that is Oh, good gracious ! no, I can't !\" Heron looked at Ogle with perfeot astonishment, and could not possibly imagine what had come -ver him to make him act in so strange a manner."], [166, "160 EDITH HERON. \" Thank God for aU that, Captain ; and I would have you, too, look out for happier times as re- gards one who you won't mind now and then hearing spoken of.\" \" No, Ogle, I shall not mind half so much hear ing that once familiar name.\" \" That's right Captain. I'm glad to hear you say so.\" \" I fancy, Ogle, it is the. more human influence that has come over me by the presence of this long-sought Amelia S\u00bbaunton. My poor mother aud I will live now in the hope of happier and pleasanter times, no longer forbidding you now aud then to speat of Edith, and no longer making useless efforts to chase her image from my mind.\" enterprise that completely discou.fited and aston ished anybody, as that night's proceedings had discomfited and astonished Boom in the yard of the Angel Inn. \" Mr. WUd, I think,\" said the porter, drawing back and speaking quite in a different tone. \" You're right my friend. Business \u2014 busi ness !\" \" You want to come into the Temple, Mr. Wild. Certainly, sir. I'U open the gate. Step in, Mr. Wild. Can I te of any service to you? I'm a sworn constable, you know.\" \"Thank you \u2014 thank you! I can manage the Uttle affair. That'll do Good night ! I dare say I shall go out at some other gate.\" Whistling still, Jonathan then took his way towards Boom's chambers, which he purposed ran- sacking, not with the idea of finding any plunder there of pecuniary value, but because he wished to obtain possession of whatever papers and docu- ments the clever and astute a torney had already drawn up or procured with reference to the Whit- oombe peerage. So far Mr Wild meant to take advantage of whatever Mr. Boom had already accomplished, seeing that the attorney had brought affairs to a ci.is between them by the attempt to get rid of him, Wild, so boldly at the Angel Inn. It was very doubtful whether Wild felt any real indignation at Boom, on account of that attempt upon his life. Indeed we may take upon ourselves to say that he did not, for the' atmosphere of villany and vice in which Jonathan Wild existed, had eo accustomed him to snch acts that he looked upon them as nothing more than natural. Boom had made a vigorous attempt to do some- thing for his own interests, in which he had failed, while he, Jonathan Wild, had succeeded. That, in his estimation, was the whole of the affair. CHAP TEE LVII. JONATHAN WILD PAYS A VISIT TO HIS SOLICITOR, AND ARRANGES HIS LEGAL BUSINESS. When Jonathan Wild left the old Angel Inn, by Fleet Market, after his successful capture of the unfortunate Mr. Boom, he thrust his hands into his pockets, from one of which protruded the end of that short bludgeon which formed a portion of his costume, and whistling gaily, he took his way towards the Temple. It was an old practice of Jonathan WUd's that whenever he thought proper to take a prisoner, he made as quickly as possible a visit to that priso ner's house or place of abode. And in this case, as regarded Mr. Boom, Jona than Wild was specially desirous of paying a visit to the chambers in the Temple which were in the occupation of that legal personage. \" So far so good,\" muttered Wild to himself as he proceeded ; \" the man must be a fool to set his wit up against mine. I thought to have gone on with him a little longer, for he knows the law, and might have helped me while he thought he was helping himself ; but since he won't, he won't, and there's an end on't.\" And now WUd stood close to the door of the chambers in the Temple which, if they ever knew the presence of Boom again, would certainly not < i ow it for a very considerable time to come Habitually cautious, WUd placed his ear against the panel and listened. He thought he had heard Boom say tbat a boy he had in his employment, and who he dignified by the name of clerk, slept in the chambers. But he heard nothing If the boy was really there, he had retired to rest, and was sleeping soundly. Bnt whether or not >' was all the same to Jonathan WUd. He in tended to look for what he wanted in those cham bers, and to take what he pleased If boy or man interrupted or interfered with him, they would have to take the consequences of so doing. Tbe only possible supposition in connexion with the boy was, tbat he might, if actually within the chambers, have adopted some mode of fasten ing the outer door on the inside, which might baffle Wild's exertions to procure an entrance. This was not the case, however ; for on apply ing a picklock, Wild easUy procured admittance. And here we may state tbat Jonathan Wild was not so well acquainted with the habits and cus toms of lawjers' bojs about the Temple and Lin coln's Inn as be might have been, or at that time of the evening he wonld never have expected one of them to be \"at home,\" while the attractions of the neighbourhood were what they were then and are now- It was after nine o'clock, and the Temple gates were closed to chance passengers. This was a circumstance which was not calcu lated, however, to impede Jonathan Wild, who al ways relied upon his reputation and the terror of his name to overcome all kind of official scruples- It was so well known that he was to a certain extent in the service of the Government, and that in tbat service he was permitted a wide And dan gerous discretion, that the mere sight of his hideous physiognomy was generally considered a sufficient passport to carry him anywhere he might wish to 6\u00b0' . . , _., m ..A_ AA Wild rapped at the gate of the Temple with the thin end of his bludgeon. The lazy porter put on his aspect of usual inso lence before he opened the wicket to see who had the presumption to wish to enter the Temple after hours. \" What now ? You can't come in.\" \" Business,\" said Will, as he presented his un mistakable face, accompanying the word with one of those facial contortions which he was in the habit of using, and more especially when he was pleased than when he was angry. It may therefore be considered that the capture of Mr. Boom was a subject of congratulation to Jonathan. , , And so indeed it was in one sense, for he was always pleased to fee able to carry out any Uttle The chambers then had tbat silent, dismal echoing sound about them whi.b in those old"], [167, "161 EDITH HERON. houses is always to be encountered. It seemed as if the ghosts of former occupant, were parading tbe atmosphere of the rooms, and giving them a supernatural aspect But Jonatt an Wild was not an imaginative per sonage, and he set to work in the most practical manner in the lawyer's chambers. Various heaps of papers and documents of aU kinds and descriptions were tossed over and dis regarded by Jonathan Wild, since what he searched for was solely relating to the Whitcombe peerage. So far os regarded the important document it self, signed by Hugh de Mowbray, the seventh Earl of Whitcombe, Jonathan WUd had that in his own possession. Or he supposed he had it. well induce a doubt in his own mind whether ha really possessed that important document or not After considerable research in the ohambera, Jonathan Wild found a small newly-made japan tin box, and from there being no name on the outside of it he was led to believe it might contain the papers he was in seaich of. Such was indeed the fact, but Jonathan's eyes dilated with wonder to find lying near to the top of those papers the very document which he sup posed to be in his own possession, and which had been so strangely found in the vault in Westminster Abbey. Wild conld scarcely beUeve his own eyes. Only once, and for half a day, had he left that document in the possession of Boom, the attorney, t.ecause in his then present circumstances it would have beeu manUestly dangerous to carry it about him. But with all his cleverness and all his full belief that he was something more than a match for Mr. Boom, the attorney, he was destined on that even ing to make an important discovery, which might To all appearance, it had been returned to him No. 21.\u2014 Edith"], [168, "EDITH HERON. 162 panions, professing his intention and ability to pay his share of the reckoning, while iu reaUty his exchequer was in a state of emptiness. Hence the necessity, before that p riod of the evening should arrive when a painful aud uncom fortable reckoning would take place, for his leav ing the gay and festive scene, which he had done by st alth, making his way back to the chambers, with many groans and regrets to leave so much good eating, good drinking, and good company, but still unable to stay and oniface the exposure of partaking of his share of those enjoyments without funds to staud his quota of the expense?. With inward groans, now and then deepening into malediitionsat Fate, and at Booai for denying him a larger salary than the ten shillings a week with which he in vain essayed to be a man upon town, the clerk entered the chambers, and after stumbling about, proceeded to get a light. The darkness was so inteKse that, although Wild rather prided himself upou seeing or feeling his way under any ciroumstances, he was com pletely baffled, and, in fact, became a little con fused in regard to which direction the door was actually in. Then the olerk procured a light and as it burnt clearly up, it shone into tbe malevolent eyes of Jonathan WUd perfectly intact ; and since he had made up matters with the Secretary of State, and was ouce more reinstated in tho favour of the Administration, he bad always carried about that important docu ment in a secret pocket in the breast of his apparel. The surprise, therefore, of Jonathan Wild on encountering it among the first objects in Mr. Boom's tin box may be imagined. He rubbed his eyes to be quite sure that he was awake He looked at the little wax-light with which he was illuminating his proceedings, to be sure that it was burning freely. And then he looked into the box again. Yes, there was the important document takeu from the vault \u2014 antique, damp, and mouldy, but presenting all the evidences of being the true and only original which he thought all the time he was hugging to his breast. Rapidly then did Jonathan WUd produce the one that was in his possession. Apart from tha other, it would probably have withstood any ordinary scrntiny ; but compared with it, it was evidently as counterfeit as anything could be. Wild smUed. He rubbed his hands together, and with hideous chuckles regarded the two papers. \" Now that's clever,\" he said, \"and almost be yond what I should have expeoted even of Boom. He had this document only half a day in his pos session, and during that time he made the excel lent oopy which he returned to me while he kept the original himself.

Bat I suppose that was to be expeoted.\" Wild lost no time now in securing tha real original document, which he promised himself he would deposit in his house in some inaccessible place known only to himself, while for all practi cal purposes he conld make use of the spurious one which had bean manufactured by Mr. Boom. The clerk. altered aery, and nearly dropped the light. Wild advanced slowly towards him. \"Are you wise enough,\" he said, \"to hold your tongue, and be~well paid for so doing ?\" \" Thieves ! ' Thieves ! Help!\" The clerk was a new one, since Mr. Boom had prudently got rid of the former boy, who had been successfully tampered with by Jonathan Wild This one did not know Jonathan. All he saw was a man of terrific and ill-favoured aspect burglariously. n0 doubt in the chambers; and he continued his ories for- assistance, which must soon have reached tha ears of some of the watchmen of the Temple. Wild was not a man who stood much upon cere mony. The little tin box contained sU the documentary matter which the attorney, with singular industry, had collected in so short a space of time, in regard to the succession of the younger branch of the Whitcombe family to the earldom and estates. Free to act as he thought proper, Wild consi dered that by far his best plan would bo to take the tin box itself along with the contents. He closed it and locked it again with the pick lock he had used to open it He was turning towards the door of the cham bers, when he started back and hastily extinguished the light he carried. A key was rattling in the look of the outer door, which was speedily opened ; aud had not the cham bers beeu in the profound darkness they were, Wild must have bten immediately seen by the person entering them. This person was no other than Mr. Boom's clerk, who was permitted by the attorney to sleep in the chambers, not from any particular desire to accom modate him or save him the expense of a lodging, bnt hecause it was vary much for the security of the place that it should not be entirely deserted at \" Take, then, the reward of your own folly,\" he said, \" since you will have it !\" The heavy bludgeon descended with a sharp crack upon the head of the unfortunate clerk, who fell to the floor of the chambers as if shot Jonathan Wild had very seldom to strike a second blow with that formidable weapon. Without casting a glance then upon his victim, Wild left the chambers, closing the outer door after him, so that there should be no actual appear ance of anything amiss, and little caring how long it might be before a living human step \"gain sounded iu those rooms. And since Boom himself occupied an unenviable position in one of Jonathan Wild's cells, at his house in Newgate Street; and since the unfortunate clerk, if not actually killed, was so far injured that he was not likely to be able to render himself any assistance, tho time was likely to be long, indeed, before any one would think it necessary to break open the chambers, and ascertain what had become of their tenants. Then Wild, with the little tin box under his arm, passed out of the Temple by the gate leading into Essex Street Strand. night But the clerk had returned home unusually soon, The porter at that gate knew him by sigh*, and so little would ho think nf interrupting him, and so great was his dread of the notorious tliief-ti.ker, that if Wild had appeared with one of the living inhabitants of the Temple, or a dead one, under his which was a circumstance arising from quite a speciality in his evening', entertainment.

Wild bade the porter a grave good night; and, on hailing a hackney coach, he took his way to his own house. sedan, without ascertaining if he was shot or not. Wild had too hastily concluded such to be the case, and so the Rav. Mortification was free. As WUd got to the first flight of stairs that de scended from his passage to what may be called the cellars beneath, he heard a screaming, yeUing voice calling out to him by name. \" Jonathan Wild ! Mr. WUd ! Jon\u2014 a\u2014 than I Mr. Wild, I say !\" A new feeling of cupidity must have come over Wild recently, and he had taken it into his head to ride about the town for nothing. Whenever he hired a coach now, housed to say, upon getting ont, while he put on one of his most hideous 1 ;oke, \" Oh, you know who I am ?\" If the coachman professed ignorance on that most interesting subject, he would then add, \" I am Jonathan WUd. If you must have your money, of course jou shall.\" In nine cases out of ten, the coachman recollected same little circumstance in his life which made him amenable to the law ; and he was only too glad to have laid the redoubtable Jonathan Wild under even the trivial obligation of giving him a ride for nothing; so that the coachman would declare how delighted he was to get nothing, and drive off as quickly as possible. This was the case on the present occasion ; so that Jonathan entered his house with a grim smile of triumph, sine?, in all the proceedings of the evening, he had to congratulate himself on being eminently successful, be tbey great or small. It certainly was a pecuUarity of Wild that he could do without sleep. It was perfectly astonishing the many hours during which be would engage himself in all sorts of adventures, without seeming to feel the necessity for repose. It was so npon this occasion ; and although he was now in his own house, where he had con trived to gather about him some of his old janissaries and bull- dogs, and he might have retired to rest, he did not do so, bnt resolved upon a visit to Mr. Boom. \" Ah !\" said Jonathan, \" that is Mrs. Ripon. I'm afraid I shall be obliged to hang that paragon of her sex. It wUl be quite easy to get up a case of receiving stolen plate, and that will settle her at the next sessions. It was a very shabby trick she played me about those notes she bad iu her mob cap \u2014 very I\" \" Mr. Wild ! Jon-a-than Wild !\" Wild dashed the heavy bunch of keys against the door of the cell in which Mrs. Ripon was im prisoned. \" Hilloa ! what do you want now ?\" \" Oh, Mr. Wild !\" \"Oh, Mrs Rip m!\" \"Do you want a housekeeper ?\" \" A what ?\" \" A housekeeper. Somebody to do for you, Mr. Wild. Somebody to look after your little comforts, Mr. Wild. Do you want a housekeeper ?\" \" Bah !\" Wild was passing on, when a thought struck him, and he returned to the ceU door. \" Mrs. Ripon !\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd ?\" \" I do want a housekeeper.\" \" I thought you did.\" \" But I am particular about character, aud I want security. If you can lodge with me the sum of one handred pounds, you may have the place.\" \" Oh, dear ! oh, dear !\" \" You decline ?\" \" What's the use,\" said Jonathan to himself, \u2014 \" what's the use of keeping a lawyer all to one's self, in one's own house, if one don't consult him ? Ha! ha!\" \" Where am I, a poor, miserable female, to get a hundred pounds, Mr. WUd ?\" \"You know that bost. Those who hide may find!\" That, then, was the position which the unhappy Boom had reached. He was Jonathan Wild's legal adviser, and for his fees he had certainly board and lodging.

You will find a capital place \u2014 no foUowers, no wages, no frequenters ; but lots of amusement, and always a window at Newgate from which to see the hang ings !\" \" Oh, Mr. Wild ! there must be too many people after such a place as this for me to hope for it\" Wild reflected.

The new-comer is well taken care of.\" \" That will do. What did he say ?\" \" Why he says he will bring actions against us all for false imprisonment, and all that sort of thing.\" \" Very good. Now get me a light, and get the keys. You need not come with me, Sniggs.\" \" Very good, Mr. Wild.\" With a lantern in one hand and a bunch of keys in the other, Jonathan descended to that gloomy region beneath his house, where the reader has already had a glimpse of the kind of Inquisi tion in which be kept his victims. The only prisoner he had there now, as weU as Mr. Boom, was Mrs. Ripon. The Rev. Mortification had bsen, as we are aware, taken in the sedan chair to the old Angel Inn yard to psrsonate Wild. It was quite an oversight on the part of Jona than that he should have left Mortification in the Was Mrs Ripon speaking ironically or not? He began to have a better opinion of her abUilies than ever he had had before. \" Listen to me, Mrs. Ripon,\" he said. \" If you will take the place, it shall be worth a good fifty pound a-year to you, besides board and lodging. But you must lodge the hundred pounds.\" \"And if I don't?\" \" Why, then, you remain just where you are.\" \" I consent\" \" Come out, then.\" Wild unlocked the door, and Mrs. Ripon, in a great state of dUapidation, walked out of the cell. \" What has become of Mortification ?\" she asked. \" Dead !\" \" Then I'm a widow for the ninth time. How true it is, as he used to say the Psalmist remarked, that ' all flesh is grass.' \" \" Or hay, in the proper time,\" suggested WUd."], [170, "EDITn HERON. 164 The laugh that Wild indulged in was one of bis moat hideous ; but it did not have any effect upon Boom, who made no sort of reply to it whatever. That is to say, the only reply that seemed tn come from him was either an exceedingly natural, or an exceedingly well-acted, snore. Boom was, or he appeared to be, fast asleep. Which it was\u2014 an affectation, or a reality \u2014 Jonathan Wild had no power to determine. Striding into the ceU, Jonathan, however, soon put an end to Boom's real or simulated repose by a hearty kick. Boom opened his eyes. He looked quite calmly up into the eyes of Jonathan Wild. He spoke in the most indifferent possible tone. \"Oh, that's you, Mr. Wild, is it?\" \" Yes ; and that is you, Mr. Boom. Ha ! ha !\" \" Very good,\" said Boom ; \" I am quite pleased to find you so cheerful.\" \" And I you ; but I have heard of people who could look death in the face with calmness, and with composure, before.\" \"Death?\" \" Or dust,\" said Mrs. Ripon. \"Or mud,\" said Wild, \"when it rains. Here, Sniggs! Sniggs ! This is my housekeeper, do you hear ?\u2014 Mrs. Ripon. Now, ma'am, you may go and take possession of the kitchen ; but remember, U you try to escape me, my arm is a long one.

BOOM GIVES HIS ADVICE, WHICH, LIKE MOST ADVICS GRATIS, IS NOT WORTH MUCH. \" Just so !\" Wild had not sought that cell on any such errand, but he wanted to frighten Mr Boom. \" Well,\" said the lawyer, \" if that is the case \u2014 and if you think of doing anything eo silly\u2014 it cannot possibly be helped !\" \" What do you mean?\" growled Wild. \" I mean that, being perfectly aware that I am mortal, and that I must die some day, \u2014 and that, too, possibly, by some painful disease, \u2014 I do not lake it so much to heart that your intentions are murderous. Jonathan Wild, having settled matters with Mrs. Ripon, apparently te their mutual satisfaction, weut further along the dreary region at the base ment of his house, till he came to another cell door ; at that he listened. It was the cell in the occupation of Mr. Boom. Wild expected that he should surely hear some thing tbat would be in some way indicative of the presence of his prisoner there; but all was so profoundly still, that a sudden alarm came over him that he had been in some way tricked. What if Boom had escaped ? Tha supposition was. one which nearly took Jonathan Wild's breath away. For the first moment, then, he seemed to fully comprehend and realize all the perils of the soheme with which his brain was so full. The scheme of passing himself off upon the world according to the terms of the mysterious document found in Wes'minster Abbey, as the true and real representative of the jounger branch of the house of Whitcombe. \" ' Come it slow, or come it fast, It is but death that comes at last.' I suppose, Mr. Wild, you have heard that little conplet before, eh ?\" Wild stepped back a pace. This coolness \u2014 this defiance, which even the dread of death could not conquer, got the better ol him. He felt that whether Boom acted the in difference he expressed, or was really a man of such iron nerve and resolve that he was able to feel all he said, he had by his words obtained a kind of superiority over him, Wild. \" Boom,\" he said, after a pause of a few seconds, \u2014 \" Boom, what folly was it that tempted you to set yourself up in opposition to me, instead of acting for me, and with me?\" \" The same that tempted you.\" \"What is that?\" If Boom were at liberty, and chose to be at once aud easily revenged upon him, Jonathan Wild, he might put an end to all those schemes and all those hopes with ease. He would only have to go to some legal au thority, and disclose the whole affair, to accomplish the ruin of Wild. The idea was too agonizing for Jonathan to entertain merely as an i ea It mnst either be dissipated by finding Boom in the cell in perfect security, or it must be confirmed, so that he, Wild, should know at once all he had to dread, and, consequently, what he had to do to escape danger. With a precipitation and hurry which made him much longer than usual in opening the cell door, he eagerly flung it wide, and standing on the threshold, he held the light above his head, so that its rays should go as tar as possible into the gloomy place. What a relief! \" Rank and riches !\" \"Ah! The earldom of Whitcombe, and the vast estates appended thereto?\" \" Exactly.\" \" Well, you are candid!\" \" It is of no use being otherwise now. I give so much credit to yonr penetration, Jonathan Wild, as to feel that any attempt to hoodwink you, or deceive you, now, would be quite fruitless. I did intend to set myself np as the representative of the younger branch of tbe Whitcombes, but you have got the better of me.\" \" I have.\" \" And I acknowledge my defeat I think that you are the only man in aU the world who could have so defeated me.\" Boom was there. Jonathan Wild drew a long breath. A weight was lifted off his heart \u00ab So\u2014 so !\" he said. \" You are here, and in Bafety, my old friend ! Ha! ha I\" There was a mixture of flattery and defiano. about the words of Boom which pleased Wild, lie"], [171, "165 EDITH HERON. put the light he carried on a small bracket in the cell, and, folding his arms across his breast he looked at Boom for a few moments in silence. \" Tt is, Mr. WUd.\" \"Gratia?\" \" Not so, if you pay me a fee for it.\" \" Which I don't intend. Advice gratis, I know, is not worth much. It has degenerated, indeed, into a proverb, that it is worth nothing ; but I have that opinion of your talents which will in duce me to act exactly as you say.\" \" You will ?\" When WUd did speak, it was in a conciliatory spirit, the difference of which, from its former tones, the attorney was not slow to discover. \" Boom, you are no fool! How came you then to seek my life ?\" \" You were the only obstruction to my designs.\" \" Ah ! Well, you see, you failed 1\" \" Most signaUy 1\" \" And here you are, at my mercy !\" . \" Quite !\" \" Yes. Good night Boom ! It is always night down here in ' Little Newgate I' \" Wild left the cell, an I slammed the door shut after him ; and then he laughed on the outside, as ha muttered to himself, \" Boom's advice will always bo worth the having, because, whatever it may be, I have only to act directly contrary to it, and I shall be on the right path ! Oh ! there is nothing like a clever domestic lawyer all to oneself I Ha' ha !\" \" What do yon expect, then ?\" \"I expect Jonathan Wild, that yon, who have been so often in danger, and so often escaped, that you seem to have a charmed lUa \u2014 I expect that you wU), now that you ars the victor, think but little of the affair in the Angel Inn yard; but that still holding fast as you are apt to do, to your purposes, you will only ask yourself what is best to he done to forward them.\" Jonathan Wild would have been interested if he conld have 6een what Boom was about so soon as the cell door was Eafsly locked and bolted upon him. \"Well?\" \" WeU, then, I am a good lawyer. You want some such person as I am \u2014 in fact, you cannot do without one; and it is of infinite advantage to you to have legal advice from somebody from whom there is no necessity of concealing the circumstances of the case.\" With great activity, he mode a kind of rush to the door, and laid an ear flat against it to listen for the retreating footsteps of Wild. When he felt convinced that he was really atone, and tbat Jonathan had retreated, he shook his fist in the direction he had gone, and between his clenched teeth he muttered, \" Rascal ! villain ! I will get the better of you yet ! Yes, scoundrel ! I \u2014 1 Bah! what am I saying? What am I doing ! Passion and violence ! They are neither of them in tho progrimme of action I have laid down for myself. I am to be cool, sarcastic, fear less, and determined ; and, withal, as patient as a mole when it is burrowing for itself a winter habitation in the soft earth.\" \" Well ?\" \" Well, then, for those reasons you will not only Dot kill me, but yon will set me free, in order that I may be of service to you.\" Wild began to admire Boom. In all their previous intercourse, be had never had the opinion of him that he had now \" If I thought\" he s .id, \" for one half-moment that I could really and truly for the time to come trust you to work with me, and for me, I wonld no more regard the pistol-shot you thought you fired at me than I should a parched pea from a boy's pea-6hooter ; but I cannot so trust you ! \" \" Yen can I\" Boom, as he spoko, took off his coat, aud from the inside of the stiff, wide, and ample collar of it \u2014 such collars were then the fashion \u2014 he procured a match and a piece of taper.

I will work for you, and with you, and for the reward which you will hand to me npon final success ; but I must be free !\" \"Must say you?\" \" Yes ; or I can do nothing !\" WUd smiled. Ha lit the taper. It shed but a faint and sickly light about it, but it was sufficient for his purposes; and after being shut np in a dark cell, the eyes get so accustomed to darkness, th.t any light, however small, that is a light at all, becomes quite an Ulumination. \" My dear friend Boom, I have thought of another expedient in the case.\" \"What is it?\" So Mr. Boom could see about him quite well. He went to a distant corner of the cell, and carefully removiog the straw on one side, he ex posed a little excavation, in which were several beautifully made tools. A file, a knife, a curiously shaped tool like a claw, which would do all sorts of work. And these tools were made flat and small, so that they could be weU concealed in narrow places without detection. \" Just this. I feel, with yon, aU the importance of having excellent legal advice ; and I believe, too, that no man is better qualified to give it to me than you. And in order that I may always have it when I want it and in order that I may always find you at home, why, you see, my dear Boom, I wUl keep you here on the establishment, so that I may have a lawyer all to myself.\" Boom turned white. \"The fools!\" said Boom; \"they took good care to turn aU my pockets inside out but they never thought of looking in the collar or cuffs of my coat, or of trying my hat to see if it had not a false crown a little belo*' the apparent one\" It was quite evident tbat Boom had calculated upon the chances of failure in his attempt upon the life of Jonathan Wild. \" You don't like tbat\u2014 eh, Boom ?\" \" Please yourself, Mr. Wild.\" \" I mean to do so. And, now, I want some advice. You know all the circumstances. Pray, what is the step I ought first to take ?\" \" Go to the Solicitor or Attorney -General, and tell him all about it\" That failure might have involved his death : but if it did net it was pretty sure to place him in some such situation as that which he was now in. \" Indeed I\" \" Yes ; he will then look over the whole affair, and then you will soon hear what he thinks of it!\" How invaluable, then, might be the various well-made tools and implements which he had concealed abont him. \" Thank you I That is your advice ?\""], [172, "EDITH HERON. 166 There came three, and three more, distinct taps upon the outer panel of the cell door. \"Mr. Boom! Mr. Boom!\" Good heavens! It was the voioe of Jonathan Wild. With the curious claw-shaped implement, Mr. Boom set to work at once- Close to the door of the cell, he lifted up a couple of bricks, which formed a sort of inside threshold to it. Beneath those bricks, the earth was hard aud impacted, but the only effect of that was that Mr. Boom was able to scoop it out in large pieces. \" Mr. Boom ! Mr Boom !\" The attorney feU into the hole he had dug, and which was nearly as deep as a grave, with a shriek of dismay. \" Mr. Boom, you must be tired. I have nothing particular to do just now. Can I help you in auy way ?\" Wild uttered these words in such a voice of milky kindness, and yet which, withal, had such a terrible sarcastic tone about it, that it sounded demoniac. He worked with a will. The object of Boom was to undermine the door of the cell. He did not feel himself sufficiently an adept at the lock-pioking business to hope to escape that way, but he thought he might burrow under the door, so as to make space to enable him to get out at the outer side of it. Boom was past the power of replying. Then Wild burst out into one of those awful, After a good hour's work Boom had made a very respectable-sized hole ou the side of tha door e_s.t to the cell. hideous, tieod-li e laughs which none but himself was capable of, and which echoed distinctly aud terrifically through the heart and brain of ihe unhappy Boom. is heart almcst failed him when he tried to eularge that hole outwards- Tbe claw instrument struck with a harsh sound against some inflexible body.

He set about trying prac tically to solve the mystery, aud he succeeded. fy dint sf clearing away the earth, he found out lhat immediately outside the cell door a slab of stoue was sunk into the ground edgeways, so that it presented itself as a barrier to precisely the undermining operation upon which he, Boom, was engaged. \" Ah !\" he said ; \" Jonathan WUd, then, has thought of that !\" He paused awhile from his labours to think- Then he set to work again. His object was to ascertain the width of the _-!ab of stone ; to find out how far it extended upon each side \u2014 whether past the door-jambs or not. That was the important practical question te decide. It was not tbat she was seeking him actually in tha full sense of the words. No ; she felt that untU, by some circumstance, her innocence of heart, and singleness of purpose, should become apparent to him, she ought not to go directly to him.

But she had the romantic idea \u2014 au idea whioh could only grow out of the ardent affection of such a heart as Edith's \u2014 that she might, by keep ing near him, and by hovering about the confines of the heath, save him from some great possible danger.

Let me help you up, little buy!\" \"Get along with yon!\" cried the indignant Tom. \" Little boy, indetd !\" Tom scrambled on to his horse without the proff-red aid of the old countryman, who, in reply to a question from Edith, said, \" I come on the heath at night to catch hedgehogs Some folks like to have 'em, yon see, and the night-time is tho time to c*toh 'em.\" \" Oh, dear !\" saidTom. The suburb of Greeuwich, which at that time 'ed to the heath, was pissed, and Edith and Tom Uipon reined up their hurses on tbe confines of the largo open expanse \u2014 thna much larger than it is uo .v \u2014 aud looked into the darkness before them, which was most profound. The effect was as if they Btood on the shore of some vant sea, whioh was a'l composed of ink, without (he slightest ray of l'ght upon its whole surface. \" Wo are here I\" said Edith. 11 Yes, Lady Edith, it looks like it. How dark!\" \" Yes, Tom ; the cloudy sky hangs like a black canopy over the vast space.\" Tom uttered a shout at this moment, for some thing cirue with a bharprush through the air, aud hit hint a confused, half soft, half anguUr kind of blow iu the face. Edith threw a silver coin to the old man, and then she and Tom trotted out on to the roadway across the heath, the commencement of which they were able to see by the help of the lantern of ih-' old hedgehog hunter. The darkness, now that their eyes were getting accustomed to it, was not apparently near as great as it had been. \"Oh, oh! Don't! Murder! What's that ?\" \" What's the matter, Tom?\" \" I don't know. It's \u2014 it's the deuce* him^'lf, I think, Lady Edith. Oh, don't! Be off! Don't, I say ! Goodness, gracious, dou't ! Be off !\" Tom rolled off his horse, aud uttered no many odd cries, tbat Edith was thoroughly alarmed, and could not think what had happened to him, or coma over him. They co-uld pretty well distinguish the darker colour of the grass from the sandy roadway. But Tom was a little dashed and out of spirits by tbe adventure of the bat \" Lidy Edith,\" he said, \" I'm quite sure you would not have liked that bit ia your face.\" \" I'm sure I should not, Tom ; and, indeed, so little should I have liked it, that I don't like the idea nf it. So, if you will be so good as io say nothing more about it, I shall be all the better pleat-ed.\" Tom was glad enough to escape the subject by a compromise of that kind, and as they were now about a third of the way across the heath, they stopped their horses, to lowk about theui as well as tbev conld. \" Tom I Tom !\" she cried ; \" what is the mean ing nf all this ? I heard nothing, and saw no- hmg\" \"A light! a light! Lot's have a light! Oh, murder ! Dou't ! He's got hold of me, now!\" \"Who?\u2014 what?\"' \" I don'r, know ! \u2014 I don't know ! Mur-der I\" A glimmering light appeared upou the heath. It approaohed them rapidly, and a mau's voice, hut in the tremulous accents of old age, called out, \"Hilloa! hilloa! What be the matter? \u2014 who bn there? Hilloa! hilloa!\" F*r off, they paw a dim light, like a star , but it was not a htar ; and little, did E lith suspect that it shone from one of the windows of Severndroog C*stle, aud that it was there at any time she could havn found Felix HeroB. \"Forward! This way, whoever you are!\" cried Edith \u2014 \"come this way.\" An old man, in the dress of a countryman, made hi* appearance, carrying a lantern, whioh sent a feeble ring of light around it. \" What be the matter, eh ?\" But soon another light presented itself. This second light wa-* on tbn heath _ aud by the way in which it skimmed along, about six feet from the level of the ground, and by the speed it made, it was evidently attached so a vehicle of some kind. \" I cannot say,\" replied Edith, \" but my com panion here is alarmed at something.\" By the light of the lantern, feehle though it wa., Tom Ripon was seen to be Ij'iug on his face on the gratis, and kicking up his heels behind him in an odd kind of way. \" Oh, I sees what it be,\" said the old country man. \" There be a many of 'em about the heath by nights, at tint- h \" What is it? sai 1 Edith. \" Listen. Tom !\" said Edith. \" Do you hear anything ?\" \" No, no 1\" They were both pro'oun^ly still for a few minutes ; aud then, as the light came nearer, they hegao to hear the dead, dull, heavy beat of horses' feet upon tlie wet, t-andy road. The muffl-d sound, too, of coach-wheels at times came distinctly enough on the night-air to be recognised A carriage wa* evidently approaching from L-'ndou, and upon tho .-ame road where* Eiithand \"A bat,\" re\\ ied .ue countryman, as he lifted from Tom's ht*u * half-stunned but rather large specimen of the bat tribe, whioh, in wiugii g its airy flight in the dark, had oome against his face.

Ripon and the coach on Blackheath, whioh Edith now, however she might be disposed to do so, found it quite out of her power to contrel. Indeed, any interference on her part would now only make matters worse, since it would lend a greater likelihood to the idea that the coach was beset by a complete band of robbers. Tom Eipon, therefore, had matters all his own way for once. The two prisoners in the coach were in a slate of great trepidation, aud one of them now saii iu. a low, whining voice, \" I can assure you, Mr. High wayman, that yon .are nnder a great mistake as regards us. We \u2014 we are not gentlemen !\" Tom was quite delighted to be called \" Mr. Highwayman,\" and he replied in a blustering tone of voice, \"Confound all the world! fire and blue brimstone ! bnt I must have all you are possessed of!\" \" Oh, I mean about that carriage, ooming on go fast?\" \" Nothing but remove on one side, ont of its way, Tom, aud let it pass \" Tom laughed. To lose eo fine an opportunity ef signalizing himself upnn the road, now that he was armed and mounted, seemed a terrible thing to him ; and he was about to say something to that effect, when his horse stumbled, and nearly threw him. A quantity of brushwood had that week been cut on the confines of the heath, and so carelessly carted across it, that eom . huge pieces, a, long as young saplings, had been left lying loose, close to the road-side. It was in one of these that Tom's horse, for a second or two, got his legs entangled ; and with the usual faciUty for falling down that horses have under all possible circumstances, very nearly reached the ground. \" Why, it's a bit of a tree,\" said Tom. \" I'll get down, Lady Edith, and put it out of the way.\" Tom dismounted as he spoke, and set to work with the huge piece of brushwood, heedless of Edith's remark to him that he could put it nowhere but where it might be just as dangerous. Tom had an idea. \" But we are poor m\u00b0n, sir, if you please !\" added the voiiie ; \" and have really nothing worth jour worship's taking !\" Tom was in ecstaoies. He was actually called \"your worship !\" \" That's neither here nor there,\" he replied. \" It is my duty to my men to b'ow you to atoms ; ho look out, and save the pieces !\" \"Murder! \u2014 murder!\" said the other person in the coach \u2014 \" murder! Dou't be bloodthirsty ; and there is my purse!\" \" Very good, so far!\" said Tom- The purse that was handed to him was not very fall. That was to drag the piece of brushwood into the roadway, so that it might possibly be an im pediment to the carriage that was approaching. aud produce some confusion that might warrant him in interfering. It was no bad notion, provided the interference were at all justifiable. \" All's right I \" said Tom, as he scrambled up to his saddle again. The coach came rolling on as fast as the horses could drag it along the rather heavy road. Then there was a shont \u2014 a rocking motion to and fro of the carriage \u2014 and then loud cries for help. Both the horses had fallen. Probably the person, whose fears induced him. to hand it at all, had taken good care to lighten it of a portion of its contents before doing so. But still, so far as Tom Ripon was concerned, this was a great success. \"Now for your watches!\" he said. \"Look sharp \u2014 for I am not the sort of fellow to be kept waiting I\" A miserable old witch, of what was named 11 pinchbeck,\" was handed ont to Tom. But still it was a watch \u2014 and how much Tom bad coveted such an article, it is hard indeed to say. \" Oh, Tom Tom I\" said Edith. \" I'm afraid this is your doing, is it not?\" \" Never mind, Lady Edith ! I wanted to know who was in the coach, and this was a much politer way than stopping them with a pistol.\" Tom trotted up to the carriage ; and when he got quite close to it, the desire to play the part of a highwayman became too p. werful for any sug gestions of prudence. Drawing one of the holster-pistols, he placed it npon the edge of the coach window, as, in a deep and ferocious voics, he called out, \" Blood and thunder ! Stand and deliver !\" \u2022' There, sir!\" said the passenger who spoke in the whining tone, \" now I hops you are satis fied !\" Tom started. There was a something in that tone which he recognised, and yet at the- moment he could not take upon himself to say where he had heard it. Tom thought, though, that if he could only hear that person speak again, he should know him \" Oh, Lord preserve us !\" said a voice from the coach. \" We are beset by ruffians !\" \" Forty ruffians, at least !\" said Tom ; \" and all armed to the teeth, I oan tell you !\" \" The Forty Thieves!\" said another voice. \" Just so,\" replied Tom ; \" so I will, as their captain, trouble you for yonr money, watches, and JBwellery ; or else you will have no end of bullets in your nobs, which yon will find far from agreeable.\" \" What do you 6av ? Fire and fury ! what did you venture to say?\" cried Tom. \" I said that I hoped you were now satisfied.\" \" Ah !\" Tom's exclamation was because he now knew perfectly wull who that person in the coach was. He had at length recognised ihe voioe aa belong ing to the late secretary of the Earl of Whitcombe \u2014 the man who is kuown to the reader as Le Jeuue, a'ias Captaiu Target Tom Ripon had a strong desire to shoot Le Jeune, and it was almost a wonder that he did not do so there and then. CHAPTER LX. Certainly, Tom might have repented so hasty an act of homicide ; but beyond a doubt it he had committed it, there would have been one notable rascal the less in the world, which would have done some good to society.

Perhaps I am satisfied, and perhaps I am not At all events, you have given me your watch, such as it is, but yonr fellow-traveller has not\" \" Sir, I have no watch !\" said the other person. Then Tom knew that voice at once ; for the owner of it no longer practised any disguise.

Bat Tom was in danger. So intent was he npon the proceedings he had begun, and was caryiug on, in regard to the persons in the coach, tbat he quite forgot there was such a person as a coachman, and snch another person as a footman, belonging to the vehicle. It was the voice of Loi d Warringdale. More than ever did Tom feel then inclined to fire the pistol he had in his hand, and tbe barrel of which rested on the window-sill of the carriage, right into the vehicle. He was aware ef some of the treacherous con duct of the secretary towards Felix Heron. And he had long been but too well aware of the bitter enmity with which the hall-brother of Felix Heron had oursued him. The former had maintained his seat on the box, when the horses feU, and when Tom Ripon ap peared. The latter was in a rumble behind \u2014 they were called dickeys at tbat period.

I dare eay I have se'tlrd them both; aud as I didn't go to do it, why, nobody can blame me, you see. Aud there isn't two greater rascals in all the world, except ing Jonathan Wild, if he happens to be still alive, and I look upon him as two villains made into onn \" When, however, minute after minute elapsed, aud no reinforcements appeared for Tom, ai.d when they\u2014 that is to say, the footman aud the coachman \u2014 began to conclude that, after all, thi coach was stopped by a single highwayman, they gathered some courage. Cautiously the footman descendel from the little d'ekey behind As cautiously the coachman got down from his box on the side of tho vehicle farthest off from Tom \"Hold my horse\u2014 hold my horse!\" said Edith. \" I must dismount, and see what has really hap pened. At all events, Tom, humanity dictates to us to render some assistance, if it be needed.\" Edith had not the least doubt, but that the pistol of Tom Ripon had produced fatal results in the coach. Then, wit^i various whispered remarks aud encouragements to each other, they combined their forces, so to speak, and came round the coach. The coachman made a sudden dash at Tom's horse's head, and held it. Tbe footman seized Tom by one leg, and tried to dislodge him from his seat on the saddle. Such au attack as this, if it had been adroitly executed, aud, above all, sUently, would have sue. ceeded well, no doubt ; but some persons cannot be silent and active at the same time ; so the coachman and footman must needs raise shouts of mticipatory triumph as they made their rush upon Tom .and his horse- The space was so confined in its dimensions, that she could scarcely conceive the possibility of both the passengers escaping. But as she was in the act of dismounting, she eagerly asked Tom who the persons were to whom he alluded. \" My Lord Warringdale, for oue !\" \" Good heaven !\" \"Aud, for the other, that rasoal the Ciptain had for a private secretary at Whilcjmbe House.\" \" My two greatest foesl\" \" Oh, there's no doubt of that, Lady Edith.\" \" No, no ! I am wrong. I should probably call my greatest foe him who is allied to me by the closest ties of kindred \u2014 my own brother!\" As Edith spoke, she dismounted from her horse, the bridle of which Tom Ripon held; aud thou taking the carriage-lamp whi.h was nearest tc her from its place in front of the vehicle, she opened the door of the coach, and holding the lamp in such a position that it cast its best rays within the vehicle, she looked with a paiuful eagerness to see what mischief had been doue. Both the occupants of the coach lay on its floor. To all appearance, the pistol-shot had been fatal to both of them. Thete they failed. Eiiith was close at hand, although in 'he dark ness of the heath she and her horse wtrft 60 far as any observation of them were conceriiod, com pletely swallowed up. But she could see from darkness to light. The carriage lamps did not burn brilliantly, and one of them was nearly expiring, but yet they afforded sufficient light to enable her to see what Tom was about. And she had seen hisproceediDgs with anxiety and pain, for nothing had been further from her intention than to come on to Blackheath to seek for such encounters as the present. Sinco Tom, however, had got himself in volved in such an adventure, Edith was the last.. person likely to ab.iodon him. The moment the coachman and footman raised the shouts which they so imprudently added to their attack, and rnshed upon Tom, Edith gave her horse the rein and darted forward. \" Killed ! killed !\" said Edith. \" Settled and done for?\" asked Tom. \" Yes, yes-^both dead !\" \" A good job, too ! That's what I call kdling two birds with one stone \u2014 and ugly birds, too!\" \" But it is shocking !\" \" Very good ! Now, let's be off. If we go on at this rate, we shall soon get the Captain free of all the rasoals that have given him so much trou ble.\" \"Hilloa!\" she cried, in as masculine a tone of voice as sbe could assume, \u2014 \" hilloa 1 what is this ? Back ! back ! as you value your lives ! Tom\u2014 Tom, look to your safety !\" The apparition of what seemed like a man and horse coming out of the darkness upon them so suddenly, altered the cries of the coachman and footman like magic. They abandoned Tom and the coach and its occupants all at once, and fled across the heath. But Tom was flurried by the suddenness of the assault upon him. His finger had been upon the trigger of the pistol, which he rested on the wiudow-sUl of the coach. He had no intention of firing it ; but on tbe impulse of the moment, wheu he was so very nearly thrown from bis horse, the necessary pres sure of that finger on tbe trigger was given. Bang ! went the pistol- There was a crish of broken glass mitigled with two yells of pain or fear, aud which, combined with the loud report of the pistol, iuw which Tom had put no stinted charge of powder, awakened all the echoes of the old co-nmou. \" But only think, Tom ' After all, human life is such a sacred thing !\" \"Eh?\" \" I say that human life is a sacred thing.\" \" I shouldn't a bit wonder but you are quite right,\" replies Tom. \" My horse will stand still by itself, and I will just make a little loop-kuot of thi bridle of yours to the bridle of mine, and ihen I'll come and put them out of their paiu, if they should happen to be not quite dead. It's horrid to liuKer!\" These suggestive words from Tom Ripon had an instantaneous effect upon the two apparently dead men at the bottom of the carriage They boih looked up, aud cried out, aj with one accord, \"Murder! murder!\" \" Oh, that's it!\" said Tom. ElitH recoiled a pace or two, and than, hy the light of the lantern, she saw the faces of those two men so correctly named by Tom Ripon, and whom she knew to b. the deadliest foes to her peace aud happiness. \" Tom ! Tom !\" cried Edith, \" what have you done? \u2014 oh, what have you done?\" \" I don't know yet,\" replied Tom, with rather a bewildered tone and manner. At th. commencement of this adventure on"], [177, "EDITH HEKON. 171 Blackheath, whioh might be considered as wholly of Tom Ripon 's seeking, Edith had had a sort of presentiment that she would have to interfere, and ehow herself in some way, eo she put on the mask which formed a part of her disguise and cestume. \" I will know who and what you both are, so it will he well for you that you do not seek to deceive me in what I have to ask of you!\" \" We are two servants,\" said Le Jeune. \" Yes,\" said Lord Warringdale ; \" we are two upper servants of a Lord of the Court and of the Privy Council !\" \"Indeed!\" It was fortunate that she had done so, as other wise she would, in all probabUity, have been re cognised both by Lord Warringdale and Le Jeune, notwithstanding her masculine habit. As it was, they saw in her nothing but a hand some and (Jashing highwayman, fully equipped as an accredited knight of the road. It was a relief to Edith to find that Tom had not committe i homicide there and then upon the heath, although the deaths of those two men would most certainly have removed two bitter enemies. \" Ch, yes\u2014 that is strictly true!\" whined Le Jenne ; \" and this is one of his carriages.\" \" We are on our road to his house, on the other side of the heath,\" added Warringdale. \" His name ?\" asked Edith, sharply. \" My Lord Olackington!\" Edith recollected that she had heard Felix Heron pronounce that name as belonging to the nobleman who, at Court, had had what might al most be called a fracas with him. \" So !\" she said ; \" that is the account that you choose to give of yourselves ?\" \" It is the truth.\" Ed th thought, however, tbat the opportunity w*s a good one of ascertaining not only what Lord Warringdale was about, but some particu lars from the secretary of the lost traces of Felix Heron at Whitcombe House. \" Will you abide by it so as to stake your lives upon it?\" They were both silent \" No,\" added Edith ; * of course you will not. I have a means here of ascertaining in a moment if truth or falsehood be told lo me.\" \" Keep the coast c'ear, and let the band hold back for the present!\" she calle . out to Tom, in such a tone of voice that he would be sure to com prehend she was speaking for the benefit of the occupants of the coach. Tom took the hint at once- Warringdale and Le Jeune looked at each other in surprise as Edith threw open a small silver plate iu the butt of the pistol she held in her hand, and affected to look earnestly into the cavity behind it. . \" Yes, Captain,\" he said, \u2014 \" all's right ! Keep back, my men \u2014 you are not wanted just now ; but have your pis ols well primed and ready for action!\" I \" Falsehood !\" she said. \" Nay, Mr. Highwayman.\" \" Do not,\" she added, \" seek to deceive me. You are not what you represent yourselves to be ; but yet I will hear what you have to say concern ing your business with Lord Clackington to night \" It was Le Jeune who replied. \" Our business is one in which you might in some way be enabled to help us .\" \" Indeed!\" To the excited imaginati mi of Lorel Warring da e, the heath swarmed with highwaymen. Le Jeune, too, was of the same opinion, and in a terrible state of fright. E-lith then, with the lantern still in her hand, stepped into the coach. She seated herself on the back seat, and, speak ing in a stern, cold voice, she said, \"_ Rise, both of you !\" They scrambled np from the floor of th9 coach to tbe'r feet \" Yes, you are a gentleman of the road, and pro bably not very particular about what you do ; so I have no hesitation, with the usual candour of my disposition, in stating to you that we are going to my Lord Clackington's to hold a consultation with him about the restoration of the righ i heir to a peerage.\" \" What peerage ?\" \" The Earldom of Whitcombe.\" \" Sit down there!\" Edith indicated the seat immediately opposite to her ; and then, as the trembling Warringdale and Le Jeune sunk back into it, she took from her pocket one of those costly pistols which Captain Heron had given to her, and rather osten tatiously looked to the priming. Lord Warringdale and Le Jenne were both in a cold perspiration of terror, for they thought their last hour had come. \" But what has my Lord Clackington to do with the Earldom of Whitcombe ?\" \" Nothing himself ; but he has a great hatred of the person who assumed the title.\" \" Who was that ?\" CHAPTER LXI. \" One Felix Heron.\" \" Felix Heron ? I almost think I have heard that name somewhere before.\" \" That, sir,\" pnt in Lord Warringdale, \" is likely enough, considering that for a long time he be longed to what I may call yonr profession.\" \" A highwayman ?\" \"Just so.\" \" Then that is how I must have heard of him, I suppose.\" \" No doubt of it ; and I can tell you that he is often upon this heath, as he claims the castle yonder upon Shooter's Hill as part of his property. If therefore, by any means you could meet him, and send a stray shot into his brain or heart, it would be the best day's work you ever did, or can ever hope to do, in all your life\" \"Would it?\" EDITH PROCURES SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM THE FEARS OF HER ENEMIES. Both Warringdale and Le Jeune now spoke at once. \" Don't \u2014 oh, don't take our lives ! What good \u2014 oh, what good will U do you?\" \"Silence!\" They were both still ; and they, in imagination, could see the stern look with with which tiley were regarded from behind the mask. Edith then spoke again, assuming an artificial voice, which, even if it bad some of her tones in it occasiooally, was not likely to betray her, as 'heir suspicions of her identity were not in the faintest degree aroused."], [178, "172 EDITII HERON. \" I, the former secretary of the Earl of Whit combe, being the man whom he took into his ser vice as a stranger who had done him a service, hereby declare that I have done my utmost to promote a misunderstanding between the Earl and the Countess Edith ; and that, on the day when the latter left Whitcombe House, I deceived both parties\u2014 making the Countess believe that the Earl would not see her ; and making him believe that she left the house knowingly, and without a wish to see him I did this because I am an associate of Lord Warringdale, and working for his ends and purposes, as identical with my own inte rests.\" \" CertaiDly ; for it would be worth a thousand pounds.\" ... \" But what makes you so interested in this affair?\" \" Oh, I know the real heir to :he title and estates of Whitcombe.\" . \" Yes,\" said Le Jeune, \" we know the real heir. \"Who is he?\" \" He is known as Lord Warringdale, and is a most admirable and accomplished young noble man ; while this Felix Heron, who keeps him out of his property and his title, is one of the most un mitigated ruffians that ever stepped.\" \" In your opinion,\" said Edith.

What is it?\" \" There's ever so many lights coming over the Common, from Greenwich ways 1\" \" It's that stupid coachman, no doubt,\" said Lord Warringdale ; \" but be assured, Mr. High wayman, that we wiU say no harm is done, and that we are well acquainted with you.\" Edith hastUy took from her pooket a pocket book, which Felix Heron had given to her in hap pier times, and wrote ou one of the leaves the fol lowing words in pencil : \u2014 A loud shout was raised from a throng of per sons who came at a swift pace across the heath. \" Are we lost ?\" said Edith. \" No, Captain, I should think not, surely.\" \" Our horses' heels, then, only can Bave us. We must not think of possible obstacles, but must take a gallop across the heath into the deepest darkness we oan find.\""], [179, "EDITH HERON. 173 \" All's right, Captain ! This way !\" Tom Ripon and Edith turned their horses' heads away from the public road, which was beginning to be quite illuminated by the light of the lanterns from the advancing people, who were brought by tbe coachman and footman of Loid Clackington's carria\u00abe, who had given the alarm in Greenwich about \u00b0a gang ef highwaymen being upon the heath. The soft, springy turf was pleasant riding on, and the horses bounded onwards in the darkness for about a quarter of a mUe, during which pro gress neither Edith nor Tom Ripon spoke a word. They were afraid that if they did speak, their voices might be carried by the night-air to the ears of their pursuers. Suddenly, however, a light flashed in their route, and both the horses recoiled before it. \"Hoy! hoy!\" said a voice. \"Where be you a- coming?\" \" That's the old hedgehog hunter,\" said Tom. \"Hoy! hoy! Who be ye?\" \" Put out your light,\" cried Edith. \" It scares my horse, and he will not advance a step.\" \" Then he be ever so much wiser than his rider, though I says it.\" whom I would willingly sacrifice my life for a any moment; but I must be sought now by the heart that has once doubted me.\" CHAPTER LXII. EDITH MEETS WITH SUCH AN ADVENTURE IN THE CAVERN ON THE HEATH THAT IT COMPEN- SATES HER FOR MANY TROUBLES. The feeling on the part of Edith, which had been for the last four-and-twenty hours growing upon her. was but a natural one. She asked herself over and over again if, under similar circumstances to those which had caused the estrangement between her and Felix Heron, she wonld have yielded to such an impulse. As often as she asked herself such a question, the answer was in the negative \" No !\" she said to herself \u2014 \" no, most decidedly not ! I would have spoken to him, and I would have taken his word, although he would not take mine, of my innocence, and so now it is fit that he should himself discover all the truth, and then that be should seek me. It wUl be time, when that happy hour arrives, for me then to forgive and forget all, and be to him once more, in pure affection, all that I ever was \" \" What do you mean ? \" \" Do you know where you be?\" \" Yes, of course \u2014 on Blackheath.\" \" Ay, ay ! and a summat more nor that ; for you be on the edge of the deep gravel- pit and if so be as you had come on another horse length. down you would have come enly a matter of about a hundred and filty feet.\" \" Gracious heaven!\" Edith was perfectly right as regarded this rea soning, and we do not suppose that any of our fair readers wiU condemn her just and honest pride ; yet it is very doubtful if, under the same circumstances, and with such apparent condemna tory proofs, Edith herself would not have yielded to them e?en as Felix Heron had done. \" Oh, lor'!\" said Tom. The old hedgehog hunter \u2014 if such was, indeed, his occupation \u2014 only laughed. \" What are we to do, Tom 1 \" said Edith. Little, however, did Edith think what import ant events had taken place at the castle on the hill. \" I don't know.\" \"Come, come!\" said the old man; \"I guess who you be.\" \"Indeed! D) you so?\" \" Yes ; you be a couple of highway birds, you be ; and I rather think the hawks are a-coming this way over the heath ; so U you don't mind trusting to me, I'll pnt you in the way of bidding them all good night afore their very eyes \u2014 he ! he ! he ! \u2014 that I will. I'm a night bird myself, I am. He ! he ! he !\" Little did she dream that her brother, the disso lute aud villanous John Tarleton, had, from fear, disclosed to Ogle the full particulars of the transac tion which had made her appear so inconstant and so mysterious in the eyes of Felix Heron. But leaving Ogle for the present in the midst of all the perplexities which the possession of the important secret brought wi;h it, and leaving Heron, likewise, a prey to all the deep-seated grief which a prolonged absence and estrange ment from Edith brought with it, we again descend that old pit upon the heath where Edith is being gnided by the person who professed to be of so friendly a turn to Tom Ripon and herself. That this man was something different from what he professed himself to be, Edith began to have a glimmering kind of suspicion. But what that something was she could not imagine. \" I siy old mole, or bat, or hedgehog captor,\" said Tom Ripon, \" whichever you may happen to be; is this place much deeper ?\" \u25a0 \" A goodish bit deeper.\" \"Oh! it is, eh?\" \" Yes ; and a foolish head generally has a glib tongue in it If you don't want to be safe and secure here, why just turn back again and go on to the heath ; but if you do, you wUl hold your peace.\" Tom Ripon was not over weU pleased at this reproof, nor at the tone in which it was uttered ; and probably he would have made some sharp reply had it not been for Edith, who interrupted him at the commencement of it, and commanded him to be sUent \" What Bhall we do ?\" said Edith. \" Let me lead the cattle.\" The old man stood between Edith's horse's head and that of Tom Ripon. \" Let me lead the cattle. There's a .ood enough path down to the old pit to them as knows it ; and let them as don't, follow if they like ; they will only leave their bones at the bottom.\" It was quite evident that a strong force was npon the common, and that lights were rapidly approaching in the direction of the gravel-pit. \" Thanks !\" said Edith, in her frank, pleasant tones ; \" thanks\u2014 many thanks ! We will trust to you.\" \" That's the wisest thing to do,\" was the reply of the old man ; and he preceded Edith rapidly. Tom Ripon was in anything but an equable state of mind at this termination to his adventure on Blackheath. He plucked Edith by the sleeve as he whispered to her, \"Lady Edith! Lady Edith! would it not be better to take a scamper across the common to the old castle on Shooter's Hill ?\" \"No, Tom \u2014 no!\" repUed Edith, in the same whispered tones. \" No ! There is one there"], [180, "174 EDITH HERON. \" Peace, Tom, peace !\" she said. \" It would be but an ill return for a proffered kindness to bring mischief upon him who offers it\" Tom said not a word. was passed through, Edith became aware that tho ground she trod npon was remarkably firm and smooth. The narrow path had all the smoothness and consis'ency of a well-kept, well-rolled garden walk, and she was proceeding upon it at rather a quioker pace, when the hedgehog hunter suddenly called out, \" Halt!\" The hedgehog hunter, as he had chosen to call himself, led the way by a very intricate path, and yet a perfectly safe one, down into the gravel -pit. That path was so artfully shielded and concealed by shrubs, that, looking down the pit from the common above, not a vestige of it could be ssen ; yet it was quite good enough even for the descent of the horses. Edith pansed instantly. \" Now,\" whispered Tom Ripon, \" we shall be nabbed, I think.\" \"Hush, Tom, hush!\" A faint, blue light appeared in another moment, and then as it changed its colour from blue to yellow, Edith could see that it was iu the hands of her mysterious guide, who had lit a match first, and then applied the flame to a small piece of thick wax candle. Edith thought that, as she had chosen to trust this man, it would be better to do so, or, at all events, to seem to do so, implicitly. Ac'ing, then, under that impression, she fore bore asking him any questions until they reached the bottom of the pit Then he spoke first to her. \" Come now,\" he said ; \" you will promise, come what come may, that j ou wiU never say a word about this place.\" \" I promise freely,\" replied Edith. \" Then come on. I will trust you.\" \" But,\" said Tom, who could not keep silent very long \u2014 \" but it seems to me, as well as I can see about me, that we are at the bottom of the pit.\" \" Yes ; it looks like it.\" \"Well, what then, old hedgehog catcher?\" \" Children,\" said ihe man, \" should rarely speak, except in reply to their elders.\" \" Oh, bother their elders !\" said Tom. \" What do you mean by keeping try ing to make out that I am such an infant, eh ?\" Edith could not help a smile at Tom's indigna tion- Edith looked about her with surprise and in terest. The place in which she found herself was spa cious, although irreguar in its shape; but it pre sented at the same time an appearance that was most picturesque and interesting. Imagine a cavern so extensive that, it was only by the deep black shadows afar off the various ramifications of it conld be at all judged of, the whole floor of which was composed of the finest gravel, and those broken-up fragile shells, large deposits of which have been from time to time found inland. The walls were of chalk, but that chalk, owing to the presence of numerous minute trickling land springs, which had passed through different coloured earths and clays, was coloured iu all directions in the most lively manner. It seemed to Edith, at the first glance she caught of tho civernous place by the light of the wax candle, that art and not nature must have adorned it \" I mean,\" replied the hedgehog hunter, \" just what I say. If there was no better hiding-place here than the bottom of the pit, you would both soon be seen ; for those above will let down a lantern at the end of a rope, which is a thing they have done before, to see if any one was at the bottom of the pit.\" \" Oh !\" said Tom Ripon. \" Come on, then, both of you ! This way.\" The old hedgehog hun:er had certainly had experience of what he was about ; for even as he spoke there appeared on the brink of the gravel pit, which was now far above the heads of the little party within it, several lights. Such, however, was not the case. The hedgehog hunter appeared very much to enjoy the look of surprise that Edith cast around her, and the exclamations of Tom Ripon. \" Well,\" he said, \" what think you of the home of the bold smuggler ?\" \" Of the who ?\" cried Tom Ripon. \" The bold \"smuggler ! Ha ! ha ! the hedgehogs I look for are Custom House officers 1\" \" What do you mean?\" asked Edith. \" Is your vocation not that which you represented?\" \" Certainly not !\" replied the man, altering hie whole manner aud tone, and no longer speaking as an old countryman. Edith shrunk back a step. \" Nay, there is no danger,\" added the master of the cave ou Blackheath. \" You and I aro com rades \u2014 ' birds of a feather,' so to speak You get your living on the road beneath the light of the moon \u2014 I, mine, by making war against all taxes on foreign goods.\" \" Then you are \" \" As I 6ay \u2014 a smuggler.\" f' And this vast cavern ?\" The sound of voices, too, descended to the depths of the excavation in strange, muffled accents. \" It's of no sort of use,\" said one. \" I don't know that,\" said another voice. \" Let's lower a light, and see what's to be seen.\" The hedgehog hunter laughed, and then he spoke to Edith in a low tone. \" Follow me, aud fear nothing.\" \" I will trust you,\" she replied. There was a fissure in the side of the old pit. It did not look large enough to enable any one of ordinary dimensions to pass through it ; but snch apertures are very deceiving as to size. This one, in reality, was large enough to admit of the passage of a horse. Following the hedgehog hunter, Edith carefully trod in bis footsteps. Tom Ripou, although he expressed his dislike to the underground passage by various groans and slight exclamations, still would not be left be hind ; and he followed close to Edith. The ordinarv lowest levels of the gravel-pii were very rough, jagged, and uneven ; but the moment the acfu.il entrance of this narrow passage \" Is the warehouse, shop, depot \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 of a band of as gallant fellows as ever trod the deck of a smuggling cutter plying between the Thames nnd French ports and Holland !\" \" But,\" ,-aid Tom Ripon, \" are you not afraid that the secret of this cave may be told?\" \"No, not at all!\" \" Yes,\" added Edith, \" even we might be indis creet enough to make some mention of it.\" A dark expression came across the face of the mug gler."], [181, "EDITH HERON. 175 \" It ia ill joking,\" he said, \" with men like me ! Keep such jokes for the other side of the grave, fur His only there that they will be safe ones !\" \" Fear nothing on the score of treachery,\" added Edith. \" If there has been any indiscretion in trusting so soon to strangers, there has been an abundance of good fortune, for we are the last persons to betray any trust reposed in us !\" Tbe smuggler laughed. \" Come, come ! we must not talk in that kind of way ! I need only tell you one thing. There are tweoty-fiva of us all eDgaged in the contraband trade by the assistance of the ' Morning Star.' \" \" What is that ?\" CHAPTER LXIII. EDITH AND TOM P.IPON BECOME THE PRISONERS OF THE SMUGGLERS IN THE CAVE. Both Tom Ripon and Edith hesitated about sitting down to talk on \" business,\" as he chose to call it, with the smuggler in the cave. They were exceedingly anxious to know whs' had become of their horses, which the smuggler had led on one side at the bottom of the pit, say ing, \" that he would shelter them in a place of safety.\" And Edith, too, had another cause of anxiety, which was that the night was speeding fast away. Ride as she might, she knew that it would take the better part of an hour to reach Castleneau House from Blackheath. \" Oh, that is the name of our little cutter ; and a tighter, swifter vessel \u2014 a beauty, too \u2014 never dashed from her figure-head the blue waters of the old Channel 1\" \" And does it venture up to Greenwich ?\" \" No. It stops about the mouth of the Medway, and there, on dark nights, it is unloaded by corn boats who come up with the tide, and unload again at the entrances of some of the long, steep alleys that lead down to the river, between Gravesend and Sheerness. Then carts bring the goods to this cavern.\" And if she did not reach the residence of bc-r kind and benevolent aunt, Lady Castleneau, before tbe dawn had absolutely brightened into daylight, she dreaded that her absence from Castleneau House would be discovered, and produce the greatest uneasiness. Edith, as these thoughts and considerations passed rapidly through her mind, looked anxiously at the small gold watch she had taken care to have with her. As he spoke, the smuggler passed onwards, bearing the light ; and Edith, following him closely, so as not to be left in the dark, passed through a natural arched doorway. If she had been astonished at the extent of the portion of the cavern in which she had been, she was destined to be much more astonished at that It indicated a quarter past three o'clock in the morning. In another hour it wculd be day-dawn : in another hour after that it would be daylight. Edith changed colour, and started. \" What now, comrade ?\" s id the smuggler. \" What's amiss now, eh ?\" \" NothiDg further than that I have an appoint ment in London within one hour of now, and I must keep it.\" \" Yes,\" said Tom Ripon, who guessed- at once the cause of Edith's uneasinfss, \u2014 * yes. We have au appointment, as the Captain says, and mutt keep it.\" \"Oh, yon are a captain, are you?\" \" All gentlemen of my profession,\" said Edith, \" call themselves oai.taiii.\" \" Captain Moonlight!\" said Tom Ripon. \" Well,\" added the smuggler, \" I have no objec tion. Moonlight is the light I like best; and now, Captain, I will teU you why I have brought you here.\" which she now reached. It seemed Ulimitable. Tom Ripon at once cried out, \" Why, it goes right uuder all Blackheath !\" The smuggler laughed. \" N' t quite that It does go a goodish way, and it ies under Shooter's Hill.\" \" Unner the hill !\" cried Edith, \u2014 \" under the hill and the castle ?\" \" Yes ; that's about it. They do say that there are some old intricate ways from -these caverns up into the castle \" \"Ah!\" \" Why, comrade, you seem to be more than usually pleased at that notion !\" \" No \u2014 I \u2014 that is \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" Edith could scarcely conceal her emotion at the idea that she might, even at that present moment, be quite near to Felix Heron. \" Well,\" added the smuggler, \" it don't matter to me whether that pleases you or not ; bnt now to business !\" \" Indeed ! Then the motive was not one of pure kindness?\" \" Not at all !\" \" What then ?\" \" Business ? What do you mean by that ?\" \" I mean what I say. Sit down.\" There were many bales and packages about this inner portion of the cavern. Some of them were ranged up by the walls in huge heaps, an,d strewn about the floor were boxes, bags, and packirg-cases of every sort and variety. Edith could notice, however, that they were all of a portable size, so that a couple of men, or one strong man on an emergency, could easily lift any one of them. \" Why, you see But sit down \u2014 sit down ! We have long wanted the help of some one on the old heath who could ride well, and who would serve our purpose as a scout. The Philistines are always on the look-out for us. We have carried on the litUe game now for a matter of eight years, but we have all along felt the want of a good, fearless mounted watch upon the heath.\" \" Ah, I see !\" \" I suppose ycu do. Now, whatever you say you have been in the habit of making by your little business on the common, or anywhere else. we will double, if you act with us, and for us only.\" \" I cannot !\" What the smuggler could mean by talking of business to her she could not comprehend ; but there was now and then a something in 'hat man's looks which made her almost regret that she had not rather preferred facing the dangers of the common, which were known, to those cf tbat cavern, of which she could form at present but a very vague and limited idea. \" Why not?\u2014 why not?\" \" Because I \u2014 I \u2014 because I have my own rea- sons, and surely am at Uberty to accept or reject such an tffer, as I please.\" \" Certainly.\""], [182, "176 EDITH HERON. Edith immediately rose from one of the bales of goods, on which, in compliance with the intimated wish of the smuggler, she had seated herself, and moved two steps towards the entrance to that inner cavern in which they were. \"Hold!\" said the smuggler. \"Do you think we are such fools as to make a proposal of this kind, and then allow you to reject it and go Iree ?\" u You will be murdered.\" \" Gracious heaven !\" \" Yes ; this cavern is pretended to be solely de voted to the purpose of a smuggling depot, but it is in reality, along with that, a den of murder.\" \" Of murder ?\" \" I have said murder.\" \" Then,\" said Tom Ripon, \" all we have to do is to knock over as many of the rascals as we can. If I am to be murdered here, I will do all the harm that I am able.\" Edith at once placed her hand upon one of her pistols. Tom Eipon fairly drew one of his, and stepped to her side. \" Hush I oh, hush !\" said the vo>ice again ; \" did I not say that I would save you ?\" \" Yon did, whoever you are.\" replied Edith. \" But how far we may with discretion bust to yonr words, is another matter.\" \" Do as you like. I am one of the crew of the cutter, and as a sailor and a smuggler I don't mind what I do ; but I don't take to shore-going, lubberly throst-cutting !\" \" Whither wonld yon lead us ?\" asked Edith. \" Out of the cave.\" \"Come, come!\" cried Tom. \"Old hedgehog, or smuggler, whatever you may happen to be, we don't stand any nonsense, you know !\" The smuggler laughed alond, and then a savage look came over his face, as he cried, \" Think again \u2014 think again! Alter your mind, or it will be the worse for you !\" \" No !\" replied Edith, firmly, \u2014 \" no ; I refuse to join you and your comrades, as you propose ; but your secrets are as safe with me as if they had never left the confines of your own breast\" As Edith spoke, a loud and prolonged whistle awakened a hundred strange echoes in the cavern. \u2022 \" To the heath ?\" \" Yes ; there is an opening close to the foot of the old hill, among some thickets I will lead yon that way, and it may be thought that you have found it yourself, so that I shall escape suspicion of having helped you, and the certain death that would follow.\" Where the whistle came from, she could not for a few seconds determine ; and then she saw the smuggler making some actions with his right band, as if addressing some orders by signs to persons who were stUl further in the depths of the cavern- \" Show a light,\" eaid Tern. \" Not for worlds! Stretch out your arm, that I may guide you. You are going towards the wells.\" There was then a confused rush of feet, and eMith felt all the pangs that were sure to be hers at the thought of having rushed heedlessly into suoh a danger, when Tom Ripon, who was not very scrupulous about what he did, fired his pistol right at the smuggler. \"Take that, old hedgehog!\" said Tom \u2014 \"and much good may it do yon !\" Tbe concussion of the air, and some part of tho charge of the pistol, blew out the light In an instant all was of a pitchy darkness. \" This way \u2014 oh, come this way !\" whispered Tom Ripon to Edith, as he caught her by the aim. The idea of going towards \" well9 \" did not seem a very pleasant one to either Edith or Tom Ripon. It seemed, carelessly and calmly, uttered as the words were, to suggest some terrible fall down some unknown depths. No wonder they both shrank back from the di rection in which they had been proceeding, and which, up to that moment, Tom had felt so con fident led out of the cavern. Edith stretched out her arm. \" Take my hand,\" she said. \" If you are de ceiving me, may heaven remember it, and requite yon.\" \" All's right This is the way.\" Tom Ripon kept hold of one of the cuffs of Edith's coat, and although he felt very great sus picion of this very cool and calm unknown pro fessing friend, he said not another word by way of objection. The distance that they now went was about thirty paces, and then the unknown person, of whom in that intense darkness not the least vestige could be seen, dropped the hand of Edith, and spoke. \" All is well now.\" \u2022\u25a0 Which way, Tom ?\" \" FoUow me. Let me lead you ; I have kept my eyes open, and know the way out. This way \u2014 this way I Quick \u2014 oh, quick !\" Edith Buffered herself to be led by Tom, but what surprised her most was that not the least notice seemed to have been taken by the smuggler or by his comrades, U he had any, of the pistol shot with which Tom Ripon had favoured him. It seemed as if, along with the pitchy darkness of the cavern, there came, as of necessity, a pro found and dreary darkness. All was as still as the grave. That there was a something strange and sus picious about this stillness, Edith told herseU in the few moments she had for reflection. \" How do you mean ?\" \" You have but to go straight on, and what I meant to do is accomplished.\" Tom Ripon and Edith both heard at this mo ment a smothered laugh. Whether it came from their pretended guide to freedom, or some one else, they could not tell, but Tom Ripon at once flung both his arms around the waist of Edith, as he cried out, \"No, no! not another step! I feel quite sure there is danger \u2014 not another step!\" Then the lond whittle sounded again, and befor its echoes had died away, or Edith cou.d make any movement to defend herself, she wa. seized by both arms, and felt ipdeed that she was a prisoner. \" Tom ! Tom !\" cried Edith. \" Escape !\u2014 sava Tom led her along hurriedly, and she hoped, rather than actually could be eaid to beUeve, that he knew his way out of the cave. They had not, however, proceeded far when a soft voice startled them both. \"Hist! hist!\" said the voice; \"Speak low in reply to me \u2014 I am a friend.\" \" Who, and what friend ?\" asked Edith. \" Hush 1\" added the voice, \" I have heard all, and would save you. Without my aid you are lost.\" \"How lost?\""], [183, "BDTTH EERON. 177 \" So, so!\" he sat J, \"here ii a little bit of mas q_er_ding, I fancy. Aad who may you be, in? fair one in disguise?\" yourself ! Escape, and seek him who will avenge tne!\" Tom Ripon, on the impulse of the moment, in cited as he was to any sudden action by the words of Edith, made a leap forward. They were both on the brink of a deep-looking hollow, down which Tom disappeared like a flash of light Edith saw tbat it was useless any louger to affect to be what she was not She assumed all the courage and all the calm ness in her power, as she replied, \" I am the wile of one who, if so much as a hair of my head be injured, wUl know no peace until he is avenged.\" \"Indeed!\" Edith uttered a shriek of dismay. That shriek was so truly feminine, that no ears iuto which it pierced conld doubt her sex any longer. \"Lights! \u2014 more lights, here!\" cried a loud voice. As this mocking word was uttered, the lights were at once extinguished, and a snddeu push sent Edith over the same brink of the depth down which Tom Ripon had plunged. Edith could not forbear uttering a cry of despair and anguish, for truly she thought that her last hour had now come. There came then the glare of some half-dozan links, carried by ruffianly-looking men, half saUors half bandits in appearance ; and he who first introduced himself as a hedgehog hunter, aud then as a smuggler, looked Edith in the face. But the apparent depth was delusive.

She heard then the bang shut of 6ome door up above. \" Don't be absurd. Have yon a match abo.it yon ?\" \" A ghost a match ? Oh, dear !\" \" Nonsense .'\" said Edith, half playfully ; \" wl j should not a ghost have a light as well as anybody else?\" Then came Ihe unmistakable sound of rusty bolts being worked slowly into long-disused sockets. \" But a ghost is nobody. However, here is a match, MUs Ghost Edith. Shall I light up ?\" \" Yes, but be exceedingly careful. Remember where we are.\" A voice sounded in her ears faintly. \" Let them starve, then. That will be none of \" Oh, in t'other world !\" \" No ; but in this one, with a great quantity of hay and straw about us.\" Tom Ripon lit a match with very great carp, holding up one of the skirts of his coat so as to protect the hay and straw from any falling spar;; ; and thus, by the little light, Edith was able to catch, at all events, a glance at the character of the place she was in, if that glance was but a transient one. our doing.\" \" In about four days, I should think,\" added another voice. \"Come on \u2014 come on!\" said the first voice. \" Come on \u2014 what does it matter?\" The sounds died away. Edith moved, to assure herself that she was in deed unhurt ; and then she clasped one hand over her brow, and pressed it tightly, to endeavour to restore the composure of her brain. She wondered, then, what had become of Tom Ripon ; for if she had been able to fall, half-fall, half-leap, down that place wUhout injury, how was it that he was so still ? It was a portion of the caverns cut into tlio solid chalk, and from which there appeared to bu various crr-vices and narrow openings. Edith had only just time to make observations so far when the maich went out. Tom Ripon, however, had accomplished some thing more than Edith, by the aid of that light He had come back from what he called \" t'other world \" to this one. As stiU as death. \" Tom ! Tom ! Tom Ripon !\" she.caUed. \" Oh ! oh ! oh !\" replied Tom. \" How \u00bbre you now, Tom ?\" \" Oh, you know, Miss\u2014 I mean. Lady Edith \u2014 or I ought to say, I suppose, now, Miss Spirit !\" \" Miss what, Tom ?\" \" Spirit ghost, aud all that sort of thing !

I suppose our time will be always from twelve o'clock to the time when some cock crowst won't it?\" \" I do not know what you mean, Tom ! You talk in riddles !\" No longer able to think himself and Edith ghosti, Tom was so d\u00ablighted that he made an extra ordinary caper on the loose hay and straw, aud falUng, in consequence of the inseoure foothold, he rolled through one of the crevices in the op posite wall, and disappeared again from the sight of Edith. \" Tom ! Tom ! where are you now ?\" \"All's right!\" \" Are you hurt?\" \" Not a bit. There's more hay and straw here. though it don't lay quite so deep, I fancy. I'll light another match, Lady Edith, and you will see your way.\" Tom did so, and Edith, who probably found, in the companionship of her faithful follower, a tolace for some of her misfortunes, andaiefug*. from despair, was quickly by his side. Before that second match expired, Edi.h conlt see that the oeUing of the place in which they now were was of great height, and was slowly dripping with moisture. Escape from the situation in which they were looked one of the most hopeless things in all th . world. \" Why, ain't we both killed ; and ain't this our two ghosts talking together, eh?\" Edith could not forbear a smile, despite all the perils and the uncertainties of her aiuiation. \" No, Tom ; I think that we are both stUl in the land of the living, although how long we shall be, I don't know.\" \" You don't mean that, Miss Edith, do you ?\" \" Indeed, I do !\" Tom sighed ; and as he spoke again, it was evident he was shaking his head in a very doubt ful fashion. But yet, Edith would not despair. \" Tom,\" she said, \" heaven helps those whc strive to help themselves. Let us explore this place as far and as well as we are able.\" \" To be sure we will,\" replied Tom ; \"\u00bbnd I should like to know, to begin with, where those steep steps, ent in the chalk, lead to.\" \" Steps, Tom ? Where are they ?\" \" You can't see them now, Lady Edith, and I have only one more match, and neve' the ]ettst hit of wax oandle, which I thought I had got, but it's got lost somehow or somewhere; but the stairs are in yonder corner, and I'm sure I can fiud my way !\" \" Lead on, Tom ; who knows but they may con duct us to freedom ?\" \" No, no ! I only wish I could think it ; but ghosts we are, and no mistake. I'll haunt that old Mortification and Jonathan Wild by turns, that's what I will do.\" \" Please yourself, Tom,\" said Edith. \" I, for my part, will not give up hope while I have life !\" As she spoke, she scrambled to her feet ae well as she could, and made an effort to feel about her ; bnt nothing in the shape ef walls met her hands- It was very difficult to stand upon the deep bay and siraw with which the place into which they had been so unceremoniously thrown was filled \u2014 as difficult as to stand upon a loosely-piled hay stuck in oourse of construction. But stiU Edith had the satisfaction of feeling assured that, beyond the shake she had received iu her fall, she was otherwise quite unhurt \"Tom! Tom!\" \" This way, then ! \u2014 this way ! Oh, dear me ! what a strange feel I had when I thought I was a ghost !\" \" Dou't think of it any longer, Tom.\" \" Yes, Miss Gho_t\u2014 yes.\""], [185, "EIHTH HERON. 179 right and justisicated !

OGLE FINDS HIS J-MBARRASSMnjSTS INCREASE, AND CAPTAIN HERON THINKS HE SUBS A VISION. We must perforce leave Edith and Tom in their rather unpleasant, situation, while we repair again x> the castle on Shooter's HiU. Ogle was pacing the principal saloon, in what might be called a brown study. \" What shall I do now ?\" was the question he over and over again asked himself, without being able to find an answer to it \"Thank you!\" \"But you are a great deal better; and if yon will only tell me what the secret is alt abont. I will never say a cross word to you again as long as I live ; that I won't\" Ogle was very glad to make this compromise with Nancy, for he was so completely puzzled to know what to do under the circumstances, that he was glad to be able to rest upon any other judg ment than his own. The state of perplexity that Ogle was in still had its souice in the circumstances attending the presence and the confession of John Tarleton. To feel that he held in his keeping the clue to all the secrets of Whitcombe House, and could iu five minutes disabuse the mind of Felix Heron of all the dark and terrible thoughts that had fonnd a home there in regard to Edith, was a thought that filled the soul of Ogle with sun shine. He therefore, in his short, blunt, off-hand man ner, told her all that hid happened. Nancy had a vicious temper, but a feeling heart, and the first effect of the revelation upon her was to produce a violent fit of crying. The second was a vUific_tion of the whole male sex, and an eloquent statement of what angels women were, and what a sweet angel poor Edith was in particular. Then Mrs. Ogle got calm. Ogle had calmly and slowly whistled a tune while all these passionate phases were taking place in Mrs. Ogle. \" Ogle,\" she said, \" listen to me, you brute.\" \" Go it, Nancy !\" \" Have you got that wretch \u2014that ugly bear cf a brother of Lady Edith's, safu ?\" \" Cuite !\" \" Has he had anything to eat ?\" \" A bit of stale bread.\" But that sunshine was changed to gloom so soon as the reflection came to him that Edith would suffer much anguish should Felix Heron keep his vow, and take the lUe of her brother. \"What shall I do? What can I do? What oughtltodo?\" Ogle then varied the question, but he found himself no nearer to a practical reply to it. And he was in the little extra difficulty of hav ing told Heron that the prisoner whom he, Ogle, knew to be so important an one, had escaped. Poor Ogle was at his wits' end. The notion then came into his head that he would, for once in a way, consult his wife. She might by some possibUity, see a way out of the difficulty, although he could not It was a positive relief to go to somebody, and open his mind on the subject. No sooner, then, had this idea found a home in the perplexed brain of Ogle, than he sought his better half, and addressing her with unwonted urbanity, he said, \"Nancy, I want to tell you a great secret, aud to ask you what is to be done about it\" Mrs. Ogle was delighted. If there was anything in all the world she liked better than another, that thing was a secret and to be told one and consulted about it was the acme of enjoyment. \" Anything to drink?\" \" Some water.\" \" Then, I take it, he is half-famished ; and that's the only way to tame wild beasts ; so, now, Ogle, I will tell you what to do \" \" Nancy, you are quite a treasure 1\" Mrs. Ogle shook her head, and commenced a speech that from some little experience in sucu matters, Ogle saw would not come to an end very quickly ; therefore, he interrupted it as mUdly as he could. \" Nancy, do you know that the Captain is very unhappy, and it's all owing to you?\" \"Owing to me? Goodness gracious! Ogle, what do you mean ?\" \" Just that I think you will be able to advise something about this rascal, John Tarleton, that will bring back happiness to the Captain, and you don't do 60.\" \" Oh, gracious goodness ! what is it ?\" \"You shall hear, Nancy; but you must pro miss me beforehand never, without my loave, to breathe it to any person Uving 1\" \" Oh, yes, of course !\" \" Most solemnly I\" \" Oh, fiddle saddle ! don't make such a fuss, but tell me all about it, unless you wish me to fall down dead at your feet this moment !\" \" It concerns the Captain and the Lady Edith. The fact is, I happen to know all about what has happened at Whitcombe House, and could put everything right in a few minutes between Edith and the Captain.\" \"Oh! oh! oh!\" . Then I wUl. Make him write all his villany out on a sheet of paper, and sign it, and then let him go ; and when he is fairly off, show it to tho Captain.\" Ogle, upon hearing this advice from Nancv, was so entranced at its practical wisdom, that 1 3 saluted her with an energy that was quite a - founding. Without another word, then, he ran out of the room, and made the best of his way to the wretched Uttle turret-room in which he had kept John Tarleton a prisoner. \"What's the matter?\" \"You wretch! Yeu he monster ! You hyena!\" \"Good gracious! is the woman mad? What's the matter now ?\" \" That's the way !\" cried Ogle to himself, as he proceeded up the stairs\u2014\" that's the way ! That will just do ! Now I shall be able to have everything right and square before night; aud who knows but the Captain wiU go to town \" And you don't \u2014 and you haven't\u2014 and yon go on talking here, and an injured woman to be put"], [186, "180 EUITH I1EHON. again, and be an E*rl orice more ? Not that I want him\u2014 no, no! A life i a the forest, and on the road, for me But, still, as I oan set his mind at ease Oh!\" do come, I thiuk I shall be able to say some thing to you that will do two things.\" \" Two things?\" \" Yes. Oue will be to make you very happj, and the other Well, the other is not of so much consequence.\" \" What is it?\" \" What do yon mean, O^le, by setting my mind at ease ?\" asked Felix Heron, at this moment, as he came slowly up the stairs after him. Ogle was completely confounded. What to do, or wba1 to say, he knew not. Finesse was certainly not one of the charac teristics of his character. \" Only that it will convince you of my good faith, and that whatever 1 do, or may seem to do, is for your happiness and good, aud that I aoi ready at any time to lay down my life for you and\u2014 and Edith.\" Esseut al'y a mau of courage and a man of ac tion, Oj; le, ou such an emergency as the present, knew not what to do. \" I will do as you ask, Ogle. For once more, I will have faith!\" He only looked at Felix Heron confusedly. Heron sighed \"Ogle1 Ojsle!\" \" Y- e-s. Captain.\" \" I am afraid that you have some secret whioh you wish to ke^p from me-\" Ogle was silent for a few seconds, aud then his natural frankness came to his aid, and, lo ik ing with candour into the eyes of Heron, he re plied, \" Yes, C*ptaio, I have.\" Herou bowed his head. Captain Heron turned aud slowly retraced his ' steps down the turret stairs- Ogle looked alter him with eyes beaming with attachment. \" It's all for the best,\" he said \u2014 \"it's all for the best ; and now I will speak to this rascal above.\" Ogle, in a few seconds more, was at the door of the turret chamber in which John Tarleton was still a prisoner. But before he could open the door, he thought he heard Felix Heron returuing. There were certainly footsteps on the winding turret stairs behind him. \" Be it so \u2014 be it so! Perhaps I ought to ex pect it. Thus will it be ever! All fall from me I Edith first, and then you!\" \" Ah,\" said Ogle, sadly, \"he will not trust me! He has repented, and wUl not put faith in me ! What shall I do now?\" \" No, Captain.\" \"Cauyousay 'No,' when you have just said 'Yes?' But 1 will not speak of it. What this secret may he. I will not now attempt to guess. Pa6S on, Ogle \u2014 pass on, and keep your own counsel. \" The footsteps approached, and as Ogle looked as far down the narrow stairs as he could, it was a great relief to him to see that it was his wife who was approaching the prison chamber of the criminal and infamous John Tarleton. \" Captain I Captain !\" \" Well ?\" Mrs. Ogle had something in her hand which, in the partial gloom of tbe sunset, he could not make out the exact nature oi ; but when she reached nearly to the landing where he was, he saw that it was a very old, dilapidated frying pan. \"I was troiog to say that \u2014 that \u2014 I mean may I ask you where you are going?\" \" To the ropmost chamber of this tower, to look at the last red streaks of sunset in the glowing western sky.\" \" No \u2014 ihat is, I mean Excuse me. Captain, but I really hope aud wish you would not\" Too well did Ogle know that if Felix Heron should persevere in the expressed intention of going to the topmost room of the tower, he would inevitably encounter John Tarleton ; and as he, Ogle, for the best purposes in the world, had al ready said tbat John Tarleton, alias Jack Deuce Ace, had made his escape, a discovery that he was still there as a close prisoner would place him, Ogle, in rather a strange position before the eyes of Heron For a few seconds these two men, both so brave and so single-hearted, and really admiriDg each other so truly as they did, confronted each other in silence- Then Captain Heron turned aside. \" Ogl\", if you wish to betray me \u2014 if you are in any way playing false to me, I think that I shall be content to give up all further struggles with the world, because I shall no longer have any faith iu human nature.\" \"Oh, OspUin ! Captain! Don't\u2014 don't speak in that sort of way ! Let me alone, and trust me only ti I twelve o'clock to-night, and then all will be well! No ; perhaps it will be a little later say two o'olock, or three, Captain.\" \" I cannot oomprehend what you are about, Ogle \u2014 for my life, I oannot\" \" But you will, Captain\u2014 indeed, and in truth, yon will I It is now sunset You know the room where you sat here, in this castle, aud where 1 lit a fiie for you. Go and stay there, and try to rest till I come to yon ; and when I \" Nancy, Nancy !\" he said, \" what do you mean to do with that?\" \" Persuade John Tarleton to sign the paper de claring all the truth.\" \" Persuade him ?\" \" Oh, yes ! I did not live as housekeeper to Jonathan Wild for nothing.\" Ogle made rather a wry face at these words. \" And,\" added Mrs. Ogle, \" I heard how he used to persuade people to do things. He had all sorts of ways, and one of them was to b_Dg them on the head with an old frying-pan till they did it\" \" Come on, then. I give you leave to try your hand upon the rascal in this room, ii he should be obstinate.\" \" I will, you may depend upon that\" Ogle tnrned the key in the loek. John Tarleton was there, and the sight of him was a great relief to the miud of O^le, for now that he thought himself in possession of a plan to make the confession of the bi other of Edith available, he would not have lost the opportunity fir a thousand ponnds. Now Mrs. Ogle, in her way, was as practical a person as Ogle. The way she set about proving that fact was to salute John Tarleton wiih such a crack over the head with the frying-pan, that he uttered a yeU of dismay. \" That's nothing at all,\" said Mrs. Ogle, '\u2022 to what you will get if you are oh.tinate.\" \" All's right, Nancy !\" said Ogle. \" That will do for the present Now, Mr. Tarleton, I wUl just tell you what I want you to do.\""], [187, "EDITH EEKON. 181 \" Without my liberty, I will do nothing. Let me go free, and I will pay you- Murder!\" Crack came the frying-pan again. Ogle had to turn a\u00bbide to hide and suppress, as best he might, his laughter. ** Come now, Mr. Tarleton,\" he added, K all you will have to do ia just this. You will write down on paper, and s'gu ir, that you are the bad brother of Edi'h, and that it was you who mur dered the old E-trl of Wh if combe on the staircase of Whitcombe House; and that, after that, you have persecuted Edith, by gettiog to her rooms in the mansion throngh a secret way, and made her give you money \u2014 not for your take, nor for her own, but to prevent hor husband from serving yon as you deserve, and as he made a vow to do.\" \"I won't write that!\" Orack! \"Help! Murder!\" Orack ! \"I will!\u2014 I will! Oh, oh!\u2014 I will! Don't! Devils ! \u2014 thousands of devils ! I \u2014 I\u2014 don't ! \u2014 don't! That will do!\" \"I should think it would,\" eaid Mrs. Ogle. \" The handle has come off the frying-pan, but T can manage it without, if yon should want any more of it.\" Juhn Tarleton was far from wanting any more of it, and he wrote pretty much what Ogle had die* i ted to him, and signed the paper. Ogle placed the important document deep in one of his most secure pockets, and th*n he released John Tarleton from the bonds that held him, and taking him by the wrist, he said, \" Come, now, it is quite dark, and I hear thunder muttering in the sky. I will lead you out on to the heath, and you may make the best of yonr way to London ; but remember, I have here your confession to a murder !\" \"Is that all?\" asked John Tarleton, in a sar castic tone of voice. \" Yes, that is all.\" \"And, pray, what am I to get by proclaiming myself all these fe'ons in one, eh?\" \"That!\" said Mrs. Ogle, as she lost patience, aud dealt John Tarleton another crack on the head, to wtich the former ones were, in compa lison, mild aud gentle. He uttered a shout of rage and pain. \" Take away this fiend in female shape !\" he died. \" Take her away, mad as she is!\" \"No!\" replied Ogle. \"No; when you have written and sigued the paper, you shall be let go free, for I shall not want you here, you may be assured.\" In a quarter of an hour more John Tarleton was at liberty. CHAPTER LXV. EDITH AUD TOM RIPON JUKI! A MOST MARVEL- LOUS ESCAPE FROM THE CAVERN ON BLACK- HEATH \" I won't !\" \" Go on, Nancy !\" Crack, crack, came the old frying-pan npon the head of John Tarleton. \"Lady Edith! Lady Edilh !\" cried Tom Eipon, as he and Edith stood at the foot of the rough, steep steps out in the chalk wall of the cavern, \" Lady Edith, you stay where you are, and le' me go up these steps and see where they lead to.\" \" We wiU go up together, Tom \" \" No, no ! Don't think of it I Who knows but there may be some danger at the top of them?\" Ha yelled and swore fearfully, but in the mi 'st of it all Ogle beard him say that he wonld do as he was decired aud required. \" Stop. Nancy !\" 11 Yes, Ogle ; you tell me when to begin again.\" \"I will. Now, Mr Johu Tarleton, here is paper, and here is a had pencil. It will do quite well. Write away, for your own 6ake-\" John Tarleton stole a eideloug glance at Mrs. Ogle, who stood ready with the frying-pan , and then setting his teeth hard together, and mutter ing the most awful imprecations, he took the paper and the pencU, and btgan to write :\u2014 \" le that, Tom, any reason why you should go alone ?\" \" To be sure it is ! All the reason in the world. What should I say to the Captain, some day, if he were to say to me, ' Tom, why did you not go first ?' \" Tears started to the eyes of Edith, \" Go, Tom \u2014 go. There is one thing that I will say to Felix Her; n, if ever the happy, happy time should come again when I can say it and that is, that in all difficulties and dangers I found a gene rous and noble friend in you, Tom Ripon.\" Tom made quite a scramble up the chalk steps when Edith spoke of him in this strain, and she could see that he was giving his eyes Uttle dabs with an old blue handkerchief. \"I, John Tarleton, brother of Edith Tarleton and son of the late Sir John Tarleton, hereby de clare that accidentally I did kill, on Ihe staircase of Whitcombe House, the old Earl of Whit combe.\" . \" Will that do ?\" he said. \" Head it, Nancy,\" said Ogle. Mrs 0; le read what had been written, and then Ogle sho k his head. \"I don't believe you killed the old Earl acci dentally, bnt that part of it don't matter. Now, go on.\" \" But that is all.\" It was almost a wonder that Tom found his way in safety up the steps, considering that he did not see very clearly, notwithstanding he did light his last match when he got up about ten or twelve of them. Tbe steps wound in a spiral fashion away from the fljor of that part of the cavern on which Edith stood, so that in a few seconds she lost sight of Tom R pon. \" Oh, no ! Yon mnst add something like this : \u2014 But she soon heard his voice. \" ' Being one of the greatest rascils in the world, au<i knowing that my sister Edith was of the most affectionate disposition, I have made her life unhappy by p^r-eoutiug her at Whitcombe .House; and she would Dot b-tray me to her hus hauii. because be had made a vow to kill the as la.sin of his father.' \" \"Lady Edith! Lady Edith!\" Tom had quite forgotten that it had been agiee. upon betweeu them he should not call her by th.-, femiDine appellation. \"L.dv Eiith! Lady Edith!\" \" Yes,\" Tom.\""], [188, "182 EDITH HERON. \" Pr\u00bby come up It's a kind of room up here. Pray come up. The steps are sUppery.\" The steps were slippery. Some Uttle trickling streams, each one not much Urger in volume than a thread, appeared to be constantly making their way through crevices in the chalk formation, so that in course of time they had made the surfice of the step-, into a sort of white, milky, pasty substance, which was slip pery in the extreme. More than once Edith had to use her hands to prevent herself from falling. Tom's Augers were soorohed a little as E lit j, just at the last second of the exi. fence of the liume from the paper, managed to light the lan tern. At first the light was wavering and uncertain, and had a hard struggle for existence with the dust about the wick of the candle. That dust, as it got red-hot, shot away in minute sparks, and the wax of the candle \u2014 for that was its material \u2014 began to warm, to melt, and to bur . A clear, though small flame shot up from the lantern. At length, however, she reached the spot where Tom had halted, and where the stairs terminated on a little kind of plateau, beyond which was a rudely-shaped arched opening, in which it seemed, by the indications at the sides, that at one time, perhaps very remote, a door had been fitted. Tom had adopted an ingenious mode of pre serving something like a light. He happened to have an old newspaper in bis pocket, and from that he manufactured a number of short paper torches, if they might be called such. Elith and Tom Ripon were able to look at each other, aud then about them. They were both spattered aud covered in many places of their apparel with chalk, but it was a wonderful relief to find that they were not con demned to darkness in that mysterious region. \" All's right,\" said Tom. \" It seems not all so wrong,\" said Edith, \" now that we can see about us.\" \"What's that, Lady Edith?\" Tom Ripon pointed up to the ceiling of the chalk room, and there, when Edith looked care fully, she saw what very much resembled tbe opening of a cellar from any London street, if looked at from the cellar below. Those he lit, one after the other, and he had to keep that operation going with rapidity, as one did not last more than half a minute, at the ut most. But still such lights were better than nothing, and by their aid Edith was able to see where she was They held up the lantern, and examined this appearance very carefully. \" It is a trap-door in the floor of some room above,\" said EJith, \" I feel assured.\" \"Bravo!\" cried Tom. \"I see\u2014 I see it aU now I\" Immediately through the rough arched opening there was, as Tom had stated, a room. It was hewn out of the solid chalk, roughly and carelessly as to shape, but there were some articles of portable furniture in it. A table, old and massive. Two stools, one much smaller than the other, and each supported upon three stout legs. A large box, or chest, too, was in a sort of re cess in one of the walls. \" All what, Tom ? What do you see ?\" \" Why, look here, now, Lady Edith ! You see this big old table, so stout and so strong ?\" \" Of course I do.\" \" And you nee tbeso two stools are smaller than the other ? Well, the large one goes on the table, and the smaller one on the top of it; and then you reach the trap-door quite handily and easily!\" The moment Tom thus explained what he meant, Edith felt a conviction that he was right; and as he began operations by placing the stools one upon another, it was quite evident that, at some time or another, that was the precise use to whioh they bad been put Indeed, when the chest was pulled out of the con.-er ani placed by the side of the table, and then the two stools on the latter, a tolerably com plete flight of four steps were made, which might be ascended or descended with ease- Tom Ripon, as he lit piece after piece of the screwed up bits of paper, looked like some con juror going through a part of his exhibition, to which he was compelled to devote all his atten tion. He felt that, should he let one piece of the paoer fairly go out, he ha4 no other means of \u00a3et:ing a light, since he had used up his last ma'.ch. ** Lady Edith, it's nearly over !\" \"The light?\" \"Yes, yes. I have come to the last two. Oh, dear me ! Do look about, and eee if there is any thing one can set light to here.\" \"No, Tom, nothing.\" \" Then here goes for the last bit. I don't think my coat, or my hat, or my hair would keep alight at all. There it goes \u2014 iu auother few moments!\" Tom Ripon was on the top in a moment \" There you are !\" said Tom. With the greatest ease he had opened the trap d or abuve, and put his head through- \" Hu*h! Hark, Tom!\" whispered EJith. \"Be silent and cautious, for we know not where this opening in the ceiling may lead tol\" \"Stop! stop!\" \"Stop what?\" \"Dou't drop it, Tom; I've found something ** \" Goodness gracious! I am glad to bear i. But be quick ; it has got dowu to my fiuger-uails.\" Edith had opened the lid of the chest which was in a recess of tbe caverneus room, and out of >he first objects that presented itself to her was a haud lantern. \" It leads to all dark I\" said Tom. \" Take the lantern !\" Edith ascended the extemporised steps to the first stool, and handed up the lantern to Tom Ripon. u I have it, Lady Edith \u2014 I have it 1\" \" What do you see ?\" Tom elevated the lantern through the trap door, and his head at the same time ; and then he ut tered an exclamation, and down fell the trap; and he took bat one leap from the topmost stool to the floor of the chalk room. R+pidly opening it, she saw that there was something within that had the __hape and appear ance of a candle, although it was perfectly black from age But candles do not readily decay, and she jumped at tbe conclusion that this one might still be serviceable. The lantern fell from his hand, aud it was a thousand wonders it was not broken, and the light extinguiaheu at once and for ever."], [189, "183 EDITH HERON. It rolled over and over, and Edith recovered it _t her feet, and eagerly possessed herself of it ; for \u25ba be felt that, whatever danger might ta lie place, it wnuld be far better to face it with light to see what it was, than amid all the uncertainties of d __*-_______ CHA.PTER LXVI. FELIX HERON HAS A VISITOR IN THE SIGHT, AST OGLE MAKES HIS GRATiFUL COMMUHICATIOH. \"Tom! Tom!\" she cried, \u2014 \"what have you dune, und what is it that has so alarmed you?\" \"Oh!\u2014 oh!\u2014 oh!\" Poor Felix Heron ! We may well call him so, for his mind was now tortured by many anxieties. As yet, he had no satisfaction in regard to those strange circumstances which had produced the estrangement between him and Edith. And, iu addition, there were now the newly engendered doubts in regard to the conduct oi Ogle. How true it is that, in the moral as well as in the physical kingdom, \"the darkest hour is just before the dawn.\" \" What is it ? Speak !\" \" Did \u2014 you \u2014 say \u2014 speak ?\" \"I did\u2014 I do! TeU me at once!\" \" Two\u2014 two \" \"Two what? Nay, then, if you cannot and wi 1 not tell me, I must look for myself !\" E lith make a movement to ascend to tho trap floor, which, when Tom Ripon saw, aroused all his liveliest fears, and he clung to her with pas \u2022 (.ionate earnestness. That is to say, this hour which we allude to as passed in a state of the most painful apprehension by Felix Heron, was like one pending that when the only two persons of and concerning whom he had any anxieties were to appear before his mental eyes, as close and faithful as it was possible for humanity to be. Ogle had procured from him the promise that he would remain in that room iu the castle, where the first fire had been lit, and there wait for him. \"No, no! Do not go, miss \u2014 that is, Lady Edith \u2014 do not go, for there are two dead and gono K hosts to be seen, aU alone, in an old room up above!\" \" Tom, you rave !\" \" I shouldn't at all wonler if I do ! I saw both of them sitting at a table \u2014 ghosts \u2014 skeleton ghosts \u2014 and no sort of a mistake !\" The reader will not fail to recoil, ct the curious sight which had met the eyes of Felix Heron in one of the apartments of Severndroog Oastle. This cavernous recess, then, on the heath, had made its way into the very centre of Shooter's HUl; and Tom Ripon, with Edith, were now actually beneath the same room of the castle which had disclosed to the astonished eyes of Heron so terrifying a spectacle. \" Hush !\" said EJith. \" Let us listen !\" From the manner in which Ogle had asked this concession from Heron, the latter gathered that Ogle was in some doubt about the precise period when some event for which he waited would take place that night. Such was, in truth, the case. Ogle could not, when he spoke to Heron, say how long it would take him to overcome the obstinacy of John Tarleton, because at that period he was not aware of the ingenious and effectual method which Nancy was about to adopt to bring the villanous Deuce Ace to something Uke reason. But still the affair took up mere than an hour and a half. Tom was quit\u00a9 content to listen ; and as no sound of any kind or description whatever came from the room above, he began to get more as sured. Indeed, he almost began to donbt whether he had in reality seen anything or not; and Edith shared those doubts, when, with a dubious shake of the head, Tom said, \" I feel quite sure \u2014 that is, rretty sure \u2014 I did see two dead ghosts all alive L\u00bbri-o Edith !\" Then, when Og'e had sent John Tarleton adrift from the castle, and when he had felt in his pocket at least twenty times, to make sure that he had the important document ready for the examination of Heron, he repaired to the room, in which, accord ing to promise, he knew he should find him. Ogle's countenance was radiant with happi ness. \"Remiiu here, Tom \u2014 I will look.\" Tom shook his head. He was evidently unwil- Iin., if there were any danger, that Edith should expose herself to it ; and yet he was most curious aud anxious that same other judgment beside his own should verify tbe sight he thought he had seen above the trap-door. But Edith did not wait until Tom had settled all these pros and cons in his mind. With the explanation of all that seemed to obstruct the good understanding between Edith and Heron, he thought all must be peace, security, and joy again. The hour was late. Ogle knew that it was past one o'olock iu the morning, and the casUe was very still. Proper scouts had been carefully posted on tne hill sides, and iU appeared quiet and serene. Ogle opened the door of the room quietly. Felix Heron was there, but he had either put out, or allowed to burn out, the candle that was on the table before him. She held the little lantern in one hand, and, as cending to the topmost stool, she pressed open the trap-door. Tom Ripon held his breath until he was half choked, in his anxiety to hear what Edith would say ; and when she did speak, he could make nothing of it. ' It was dn a slo w, solemn voice that Edith quoted the words from Shakspere : \u2014 The wood fire had burned red and hollow. No longer did it give forth the smallest flame, but it sent a rich crimson colour over the room. \" * The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures !' That same tint fell ttpon the face and upon the clothing of Felix Heron. It fell upon a pair of pistols that xveie upon the table, and npon the sword which he had taken off, and rested against the chair. But Heron slept. He had looked at the fire, imagining aU kindsof faces, scenes, and places in the red embers, until he had closed his eyes iu sleep. Then she drev herself up through the trap door, and disappeared from Tom's sight But when Tom Ripon saw that act of Eiith, he at once mounted the stool, and resolved to follow her let the consequences be what they might."], [190, "184 EDira HERON. | The opening of the door, and the colder air which rushed into the room, and for a few minutes made the burnt wood on the hearth crackle and fly into millions of bright sparks, failed to awaken him. Did Edith know or imagine that she was on a journey to him whom she loved so tenderly and truly, when she commenced her explorations of the smuggler*' cave ? Could it oven have entered into her imagination to believe that the end of those peregrinations would be in a room where she should see Felix Heron ? Ogle paused. Should be awaken the sleeper? That was the question he put to himself. The sleep of Heron appeared to be sound and unbroken by any tioublous visions. The dis tance of John Tarleton from the castle was each half-hour, no doubt, materially increasing ; so that if Heron, on the first flush of the intelligence of who and what he was, shonld wish to pursue him, it would be much more useless an hour hence than now. Ah, no ! And yet\u2014 yet from the first moment that she bad breathed the air of the castle, she had felt a glow of happiness pervading her bosom, which had been a stranger to it from the time she had Uft Whitcombe House- Tom Ripon had followed her in wondering silence. Ogle determined that he would keep his com munication, most welcome as it would surely be, until Felix Heron should open his eyes naturaUy. Slowly he left the room. The door was closed Hgain. The bright, red embers on the hearth turned duller, and the sUence of the apartment was un broken. So far as regarded the terrible sight that had met Tom's gaze in ihe chamber with the trap door, it had been reserved for the courage and constancy of Edith to strip the mystery of aU supernatural terrors. There were two dead persons seated on chairs in that room. But tbat was all. One, two, three o'clock came, and Heron stUl slept. What tragedy \u2014 what teriible train of circum stances had produced the catastrophe she had no means even of guessing, but she walked past the poor remains of humanity with a slow step and a reverent air. Ogle paid two visits to the room The last was just as some distant clock in Greenwich struck the hour of three. Ogle crept slowly ont of the apartment, and sat down on tbe stairs some distance from its door. He rested his head on his band, as he whispered to himself, \" I shall be sure to hear him as soon as he wakes up, and begins to move about-\" Then Ogle fell aslrep himself. The burnt wood on tbe hearth became of a duller crimson still, but Felix Heron stirred not. \" It is only the dead, Tom,\" she said. Tom Ripon shuddered, aud gave, as the sailors have it, as \" wide a berth\" as possible to the figures. He had all that terror and dread of any thing in the ehapeof death which besets the young before they have become familiar, by sad and tear ful experience, of the phenomenon. From that room there ran a narrow passage in the thickness of the wall of the castle, which was easily discovered and tracked from that side, but which was artfully hidden in the old wainscot ing of the room to which it led. This latter room was one of the ordinary dwell ing apartments of the castle. And so it was that Edith and Tom Ripon, at about half-past three o'clock on that eventful morning, found themselves in Severndroog Castle. A slight noise, however, sounded from the cor ner of trie room. A corner of tbe room in which there was a capaoiocs cupboard that had been casually looked at both by Ogle and Heron. There had seemed to be nothing peculiar abont it on their examination of it ; bnt, for all that, the slight sound that disturbed tbe repose of that loom, came from tbe direction of that cupboard. Then tbe door of it slowly opened. So slowly, that it was a good two minutes be fore it was enongh to admit of the passage of a human form through it, out into the room. Is Felix in danger ? Have his foes at length tracked him to his place of refuge ? Are they about to pounce upon him in his sleep, despite all the vigilance of his faithful followers, and drag him to a prison ? There is a human form on tho threshold of the doorway of tbat oupboard \u2014a human form, with arms iu its hands- Nay, there are two persons, one immediately behind and in the shadow of the other. And beneath the same roof with Felix Heron. Tom Bipon plucked Editb by the sleeve. \"Oh, Lady Ediih\u2014 Lady Edith!\" \"What is it, Tom?\" \" Don't you know\u2014 don't you recoUect the old rascal in the cave?\" \" I shall never forget him, Tom.\" \" Bnt I mean, what be said ?\" \" He threatened our lives \" \" Oh ! bnt it was something a good deal more interesting than that. He said tbe cave went ever so far under Shooter's Hill ; and if it does, why it goes under the castle where the Captain was to be.\" And both are armed. Edith sighed. Tears would rush to her eyes, whether she wished them to weU up from the fountains of her heart or not. Ah, no I there is no danger. An angel's visit could not be more pore and more safe for Felix Heron, than that of tbe slight and graceful person who dow steps into tbe apartmeut, and casts a glance at the sleeper in the chair, by the dim, dull red fire \" Do you think, Tom, that I can forget ? Oh, no, bo! I may be here. beneath his roof \u2014 I may be breathing tbe same air lhat he breathes \u2014 I may hear his voice \u2014 I may see him ; bnt, but \" \" But what, Lady Ediih \u2014 what do jou mean ?\" \"Nothing, Tom, nothing; hut simply that if you realty feel for me all she aflt-cion and all thw attachment that I ihiLb aud hope you do, you will on this night obey me iu all things.\" \"To be sure 1 wUl.\" It is Edith. Edith beroelf, who passing through the trap door in tbe ceiling of the mysterious chalk-room, has made ber way step by step throggh some of the secret and bidden passages of the castle until <v_te has reaobed that room- And Tom Ripon has followed her."], [191, "EDITH IIEKON. 18,\"> \u2022 Then come what may, do not utter another word until I address yon.\" Tom Ripon thought the order an odd one, but he obeyed it. through her tears as he slept by the embers of the dying fire. Bnt, by a painful effort, Edith succeeded in get ting her feelings under control. She clasped both her bands over her heart. The pressure seemed to still tbe wild tumultuous beatiDg, and then, step by step, she slowly made ber way into the room. How soundly he slept! Is there no angel voice to whisper to him that bis Ed- h is present? Can none of the invisible and flying spirits which it is some people's philosophy to believe throng the space around us, tell him lhat his heart's idol i. so close to him ? Why does he not awaken, aud feel and know that ho has but to stretch out his arms to olasp his own Eiith to his heart? CHAPTER LXVII. EDITH REACHES CASTLENEAU HOUSE TOO LATE FOE LOVE AND FOR RECONCILIATION. Edith clasped her hands. She drew her breath in short, thick, spasmodic gaBpingc. For some few seconds she thought that the faintnesn wtjich came over her would compel her to call aloud to Felix Heron. To that Felix Heron whom she still loved better than life itself, and whom she now looked upon But he slept on. He moaned in his sleet\" No- 24 \u2014 Edith."], [192, "186 EDITH HEr.ON. | He moved slightly in the chair. Edith shrunk back. But it could not last. Amid the stillness Edith heard, and Tom heard it, too, the sound of approaching footsteps. There was no resource now but instant flight Poor Tom Ripon was in an agony. The promise he had made to Edith, not to speak, be saw now involved a consequence he had not suspected, for it prevented him from calling out aloud to Felix Heron that Edith was present- To be sure, Tom Ripon could easily have adopted some other mode of awaking Her. in, but he was too faithful to any promise he made to Edith, to seek to break it in the spirit whUe he kept it merely in the letter. So Tom was silent or present discovery. Edith placed her finger on her lips. She took, then, rapidly from its sheath a small fmcy poniard, which she had found among her jewels at Whitcombe House, and quickly severing a lock of her fair from her brow, she laid it gently on the breast of Heron. \" Farewell !\" she said. Another instant, and she was throngh the secret panel in the cupboard. Tom folbwed her. And step by step, Edith slowly advanced until she was close to Heron. The crimson firelight shone upon her; she brushed aside her tears, and strove to look fixedly iu hia face as he there sat sleeping. How pale he looked ! At least, she thought he did. And she thought, too, that upon his features there was a look of sufforing that she had never seen before. But the word farewell that she had nttered had reached the senses of the sleeper. At the same moment that the secret panel closed npon Edith and Tom Ripon, Felix Heron opened his eyes and looked about him with a startled and anxious gaze. It was at the same instant of time that Ogle opened the door of the apartment, having made np his mind that he would keep the secret with which his heart was burdened no longer, but would awaken Heron to listen to it. For a moment her heart melted towards him, and she held ont both her arms. Tom Ripon very nearly uttered a cry. But she dropped her arms again. Torn Ripon repressed the cry, and only made a moaning noise, as- if some bee had -found its way into the room. \"Captain! Captain!\"' began Oglei \" Ah !\" cried Heron. \" What a dream\u2014 what a dream I\" \" A dream, Captain ?\" \" Yea, Ogle ; and I conld try to sleep auain, for I fancied thai Edith came to me, and left a soft and fender kiss upon my brow !\" \"No!\" Edith spoke faintly. So faintly that the tones, soft, gentle, and musi cal a-i they were, might mingle with slumber, but could not break it. \"Yes, yes! And so like reality vrns it\u2014 so palpable did it Seem to be \u2014 that were it not that my reason tells me it is impossible, I could believe implicitly in its fuU reality.1' Ogle advanced now with a serious, aud what ha meant should bo a solemn look, but while there was a smile npon his Ups. tears glistened in his eyes. \" Captain ! Captain 1\" Heron saw that Ogle had something particular to say which must have produced a great impres sion upon him, and he looked expectantly at. him, as he said in agitated tones, \" Speak, Ogte, speak! What is it? What has happened ?\" \" AU to the good, Captain. Read that !'v Ogle handed the confession of John Tarleton. Bat tha fire at that moment collapsed, and there was not light enough in the room to read by. The red charred embers had become soft and rotten, and eo had fallen together with a light, fragile sort of crash. \" No,\" she eaid, \" no ; the time has not yet cornel It must not be through tears only, and at a period Of sentimental recollection of all the love, all the devotion, and all the confidence of the past, that I rest again upon tha heart of Felix Heron ; but it must be as a consequence of my complete justification, and that time has not yet come.\" Edith little thought how near that time was, and that at the very moment she was speaking, Ogle had again commenced the ascent of the staircase from the-hall of tha castle to that vary room, in order to show Heron tha confession of John Tarleton. But such are the accidents of life. We miss, no doubt, death by many a hair's breadth ; and likewise we miss some glorious, happy moments by as narrow a conjuncture. Edith stooped lightly and gently. Her lips just touched the brow of Felix Heron. That was all. But out of that crash in the space of half a minute sprung a tall blue flame, which lit up the room with a pleasant lustre. Captain Heron was able to read. The first words struck him with amazement, and his eyes became fascinated to the paper which he held in his hands. The half-sob with which tha kiss was accom panied was too light to break his slumber. Edith then turned aside. One hand wm over her eyes, and she tottered back to the seoret entrance by which she had made her way into that room. Then Tom Ripon flung himself on his knees before her. He stopped ber progress. He held her firmly by her apparel \u2014 he looked beseeohingly in her face. He pointed to Felix Heron. She knew well what he meant. A flush of colour came over his face, and when he had read all, he shrieked out aloud, \" Edith ! Edith ! Oh, heaven ! my Edith ! My own dear, dear Edith! I recint my vow, Edith ! To my heart, dearest, best, ever more my own Edith ! Edith !\" O^le was alarmed beyond expression at the effect which the paper had had upon Felix Ht-ron, who, after in the wildest and most violent manner uttering the words we have set down, fell from the chair to the floor, and seemed dead or dy ing. \"Help! help!\" cried Ogle. \"Help! Captain, Captain I What is the matter ? HJloa ! Water \u2022' But she shook her head. Very sadly she shook her head, and Tom conld see the bright tears glistening on her cheeks. Again he pointed imploringly to Heron ; then he clasped his hands entreatingly. It was a strange piece of affectionate panto mime that which was taking place in that room, lighted only by the dull red rays from the expiring wo.d fire. \u2014 wine! \u2014 brandy !\""], [193, "187 Es.lTII HERON. He raised Heron in his arms, and tbeu that lock of hair which Edith had left upon his breast at trac ed Ogle's attention. \" What is this, Captain ?\" he said. \" What can this be, and where did it come from ?\" Captain Heron, as regarfed gutting Daisy ready for a gallop to Loudou. He (O^rle) was. to tell the truth, as much puzzled as Heron could possibly be with tha occurrences of the night. Daisy had had a long rest, and was in a quirter of an hour quite at the service of her master. Lights flittered to and fro in the lower part of the old castle, and it was to Heron only the delay e.f about three minutes to make his way into one room, and breathe a tender adieu to one person, liefore he left Shooter's Hill. Heron lifted the lock of hair to his eyes. The bright blue flame shone upon it. Who should know it so well as he did ? Who should be able to recognise it as he recognised it, with heart and soul, as belonging to his Edith ? The revulsion of feeling that now took place probably saved him from some seiious swoem, for tbe tears ran from his eyes as he pressed the lock of hair to his lips, and called ont, \"Ed.ih! \u2014 Edith! Come to me, my Edith! Where are you, my own loved one, to say that you wUl for give and forget all the past ?\" Alas ! Edith did not hear him. That person was his poor mother. Amelia, Countess of Whitcombe, was in but a precarious state, aud it was an intense grief to Felix H-ron to fiud that her long sufferings had really to a certain extent affected her mind- She and Tom Ripon were too far away. \"Captain,\" said Ogle, \"I am like a fellow walking in his sleep ; I can't comprehend what all this means. How came the lock of hair on yonr breast?\" CHAPTER LXVIII. JONATHAN WILD CONTEMPLATES A TRIP TO HOL- LA>D, BUT -Mt-ETS WITH AN INTERRUPTION Heron shook his head. \" This is unkind of you, Ogle.\" \" Good gracious ! w hat is ? What have I done to you, Captain, now?\" . Yon have seen Edith \u2014 she is probably clo-e at hand. You have arranged all this. You brought this lock of hair from her, and placed it on my breast; and now you go too far\u2014 you aie cruel and unkind row, because, although you see how much I suffer, you will not summon her to me.\" \" Captain, on my life it is not so !\" \" Not so ?\u2014 not so ? Then how comes this lock of hair here ?\" Off and away \u2014 over tha heath, like a spectre hor-cm .a on a spectre steed \u2014 dashing through the darkness, and making the tufts of grass and loose pebbles, whenever they came to a bit of sandy load, fly behind them, went Daisy and her master. Never had the noble and gallaut ceature made such speed, and shown snch a complete disregard of eill obstacles en her route. Several palings and one wide brook were leaped with an ease and a precision that showed darkness was much the same to the fine senses of Daisy as the light of day. By voice and gesture, Felix Heron urged on wards the fleet footed friend who had served him so well and so often in the hour of need. Ogle shook his head. \" I suppose, Captain, you had it by you, and took it out to look at it before you weLt to sleep ?\" \" No, no ! A thousand times, no ! I had no such thing by me ; s. that subterfuge will not do, Ogle.\" \" Then, Captain, I swear to yon, by everything sacred, that I know nothing about it!\" Heron was amazed; he locked about him in Hank astonishment. He knew that the distance was too short to pro duce tbe least distress to Daisy. She would hive galloped with him double that number of miles without turning a hair. The heath \u2014 the hill \u2014 the castle and the old town of Greenwich were soon left far behind, and London was rapidly approached. The road from the metropolis to Blackheath was at that time a very different one to what it is at the present period, when Greenwich is little more than a suburb of the great city. Then there were some three or four mUes of real country. \" Am I awake, Ogle ?\" \" Ob, there's no donbt about that.\" \" Then, in good truth, there are \" ' More things in heaven, and or. earth, Daisy pissed the tall hedgerows and the orchards like the wind. Than are dreamt of in onr philosophy.' Here is a lock of Edith's hair, lying on my breast now, which was not there before ; and you bring me at the same time a full explanation of the pact, arjd a confirmation of her purity and innocence! Oh, Ogle ! where is she? \u2014 where is she ?\" \" On my soul, Captain, I don't kuow !\" \" Then I wiU seek her ! Saddle Daisy sal me at once, Ogle. I am off to town ! At Cabtleneau House I may find her! Saddle Daisy for the ro*d, Ogle. Oh, quick! quick! or 1 shall go mad with impatience. Yet one moment. Where is that man \u2014 her brother, John Tarleton ?\" Persons who at that early hour happened to be up and about, saw little more of the steed and its rider, bnt a black sort of vision that flew past them, and then was lost in the dim shadows of the night In a few seconds over the half-hour from the time of starting from Severndroog Castle, on Shooter's Hill, Captain Heron drewieiu at the iron ga'e that enclosed the court-yard of Castleneau Hemse, in Bloomsbury. But Daisy was not tired in the least. Indeed, she seemed as though she had rather enjuyed the gallop than otherwise. \" Now ! now !\" exclaimed Heron as he leant aside frem his saddle, and pulled the bell of Castle neau House, \u2014 \" now, snrely, I shall again look into the dear eyes of my own Edith ; and all doubt \u2014all perplexity \u2014 all sorrow shall pass away like a dream !\" \" Gone. I let him go.\" \" That is as weU ; but he shall suffer no harm from me, for Edith's sake. Oh, my poor father ! I cannot now avenge you ; but U your spirit can look down upon the actions of those you have left behind, still to play their parts in the great drama of the world, you will approve my motives !\" Tue bell sounded with a hollow, and, to his thinking, a solemu, cadence at that hour of tha Ogle was not slow to carry out the orders of"], [194, "188 KDITH HERON. aud seizing old Anthony hy thn arm, he led him along a few paces, until his face was within the faint rays from a lamp at the gate of Montague House. Then looking him iu the eyes, he eaid in a voice of deep emotion, \"Tell me at once what has happened ? Is Elith well ?\" \" Quite ! quite! When last I saw her, she was quite well, and for all I know, she id now!\" \" She is here ?\" morning \u2014 nearly four o'clock ; and he waited with a shuddering impatience fur the appearance of some one to admit him. It was old Anthony then who came into the court-yard with great haste, and who ran as fast as his infirmities woald permit him, across the ancient fl^g-tones ty the iron gates. He paused oDly a moment, as he cried out, \" Who? who ? Speak, if only a word !\" Old Anthony had been for the last two or three hours in the most terrible anxiety en account of Edith. \" She ought to be, but she is not at home, be cause she went out some four or five hours ago with Tom Ii'pon, to look for you.\" These words of old Anthony certainly conveyed some information to Heron, hut not all th\u00bbt he required. The old servant did not consider that he was breaking aDy faith with Edith hy being completely open-hearted and communicative to Heron, so he told him all he knew. The reader is aware that he shared with Martha, Lady Castleneau's maid, the knowledge of the secret expedition of Edith from Castleneau Hoa^e ; and as he had promised to keep the secret, he did so. But, then, Anthony had fully expired E Hi h's return ata much earlier hovir than this, at whioh he beard the, to his ears, welcome and delightful sound of a horse's feet at the old iron gates of Castleneau House. Felix Heron listened to tho narration with the most puiuful anx ety and attention \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"to what dangers may she be exposed, with no one but that heedless boy, t:> aid and protect her? Whither can I seek her ? I must return at once to the castle and the hea'h. Are you sure, my good Anthony, that you heard soinethiog about Bla.-kheath?'1 The rapidity with which the ancient serving man made his appearance could beeisily accounted for. Poor old Anthony had only sat in the greit hall, in the loug-ditfnged porter's chair; and there he had endeavoured to sleep, as the saving is, \" with one eye open\" while he waited for tho re turn of Ediih. 41 Oh, 3 es\u2014 quite sure.\" \" Then it is irom Tom that she has that infor- mat ion ; and, at all events, I am p'eased to hear that he is with her, for it rids me of one anxiety, inasmuch as I thought he had fallen into the hands of Jonathan Wild \" How the ancient serving man was to endure such a trying and fatiguing existence, if it lasted many nights, he no* atvked himself. P*iha[js he relied upon snatching from the day some hours of repose. Heron spoke sadly. Od Anthony Btood looking at him, and slowly rubbing hU hands one over the other, wondered what he would Dext propose to do. At the same time, the old man kept listening and casling his eyes anxiously towards the irongate,in the hope that he shoa'd hear or see Edith. But no E iith appealed. \"Anthony,\" said H*ron, after a pause, and as be tied the bridle of Daisy to the railings by the hall steps \u2014 lt Anthony, it is fit and pr 'per that I should say to you, and to all persons who have the happiness of knowing Edith, that some strange circumstances have cume to my knowledge this night, which not only absolve her from all shadow of blame, but at the same time prove her still more to be the same dear angel she has ever been I\" Anthony, at these words, burst into tears and cried aloud. But now surely, he thought, the dear, much loved Eiith had come bwc^. \"Speak! speak \u2014 only a word, that I may know your voice !\" he ciied again, as he reached the gate. Then Anthony's heart sunk, for be only saw one horseman ; aud in the darkness, whether tbat were Tom Bipon or Edith, he could not exactly say. But he never suspected that it was neither of them \" It is I, Anthony,\" said Felix Heron. Then the old mun uttered another cry, and this time it was one of joy. Surely, he thought, Edith and Heron had met, and all would be well again. And yet why was she not with him ? Why and how was he there at the gate of Castleneau House alone ? Tbat was a simple queution for Anthony to ask ; and as he dung open the gate, which he bad only lightly fastened, in order that on Edith's return he might be able to admit her quickly, he said, \"Oh! Felix, Felix, where is she? Where is onr poor dear, good child, Edith?\" Heron was much affected. \"Oh, Mr. Felix- Mr. Heron, Earl of Whit combe, or Captain, or whatever you like to be called best, why could you ever harbour a thought tbat onr dear girl was other than an angel upon earth? She was always as good as Bhe wa. beauti ful ; and that she was really and truly beautiful. all eyes saw.\" \" Can you not forgive me, Anthony ?\" Felix Heron held ont hie band, which Anthony bestowed a warm pressure upon ; for next to Edith, whom he might be said to idolise, he certainly was attached to HerGn. To old Anthony, anybody on the younger side of forty years of age was a child. \" Edith is here!\" exclaimed Heron as he flung himself f r. m tbe back of Daisy, and then letting the bridle hat'g in a long loop over his arm, confronted old Anthony. - No, no!\" \" Come then,\" said the Tatter, \" since I am here, show me tbe chamber of Edith. It ie possible that I may there find some note, letter, or memorandum that may guide me in my search for her\" Daisy was left to rest close to the hall steps, and the old man preceded Heron to the room in the occupation of Edith, where Mar (.ha was waiting for her. \" Not here ? Edith not here ? Oh, heaven direct me then where to seek ber!\" ** Good gracious ! do you mean to say that\u2014 that you tbat, I mean, shu \" \" What do you mean, AnthoDy, and what is it yon would tell Die, tbat makes jou so agitated?\" \"All! all!

Anthony turned very pale. \" Yes,\" added Heron \u2014 \" yes; I have had a visit from the pure and unsullied spirit of my Edith, whom in this life I shall never see again.\" \" No, no ! you ought not to say that,\" sobbed Martha. \" Yes, I am unworthy to see her again. I did not think enough of her. I did not make enough of her when I had her.\" Martha was quite as much affected as Anthony had been to hear that the cloud that had been wafted by ciroumstances over the happiness of Edith and Heron had passed away ; and if Edith had only been there, what joy would have reigned beneath the roof of old Castleneau House I \" My dear boy,\" said Anthony sententiou.ly, \"that is what wa always think and say of the dead ; not that I believe our Edith is dead at all, bless her dear eyes I\" Felix Heron now took from his breast the lock of hair that had been so mysteriously left with him as he slept at the castle. \" Look at that, Martha,\" he said ; u and you too, Anthony, look at it well.\" u Yes \u2014 yes, we do.\" \" Whose hair is that?\" \" Tell me, Martha,\" said Heron \u2014 \" teU me, did Edith leave no note or letter for me ?\" \" Yes ; under that dressing- glass.\" Heron eagerly looked for the letter, and there he found it, sealed and addressed to him. With eyes that a^hed and burned with the hot tears that stood in them, Heron read the letter : \u2014 \" Edith's\u2014 Edith's. It is dear Edith's I\" \" Well, when I awakened from wbat seemed a sleep, iu which there came to me the stiange vision I have mentioned to you, I found this lock of hair, which I had certainly not possessed bofore, resting on my heart.\" Neither Martha nor Anthony could find any thing to say now in contradiction to what Felix Heron alleged, and they only trembled and looked at each other and at him despairingly. It was Martha, who, perhaps with a little par donable feminine curiosity then said, \" I don't think you have read all the letter.\" Heron shook his head. \"Castleneau House. \u25a0 To my still, as ever, dear Felix. \" Do not grieve for me if any accident has happened to me which may have the effect of separating us in this world of trouble, doubt, and perplexity ; because, my dear Felix, we shall meet snrely in another, where tears and sorrow are un known.\" Poor Felix Heron could not go on with the letter. He uttered a cry of despair; for those words cut him to the heart Sinking back, he would have fallen, but that he rested on the side of Edith's conch, and then he seemed for some minutes to be more dead than alive. \" N.>, no 1 I cannot \u2014 I dare not just now ! It would kill me. When I am more composed, I will try to do so; but not now \u2014 not now.\" Heron then cast one last glance about him, and at the room, and with a deep- drawn sigh, he left it. Both Anthony and Martha were in a great state of alarm, and they both spoke together, imploring him to be of good heart and courage, and to hope for the best. \" I will now gallop back to the castle,\" he said, \" and make what inquiries 1 can. I cannot stay to see my dear friend and annt Lady Castleneau, but you shaU both of you tell her what has happened.\" \" Not yet, without the consent of Edith,\" said old Anthony. \" We promised her that we would keep the secret, and we will keep our word.\" \" Yes,\" added Martha. \" But not later than when all hope of her coming back, and explaining her absence to Lady Castleneau herself, has passed away !\" \"Be it sol\" said Heron; \"and now, farewell for a time ! It may be that to-morrow night I shall be here again.\" Heron, with a saddened air and a slow footfall, made his way to the court-yard again of old Castleneau House; and mounting Daisy, he waved his hand to the two servants, and galloped off. The day was dawning. The first sounds that are heard in the great metropolis were begiuoing to be manifest. The sky to the east was of a dull, sickly, slaty, green colour. Felix Heron had been off and away from Castleneau House about half an hour, when Anthony, who had seated himself in the great arm-chair in the hall, suddenly started awake. He had dropped into an uneasy slumber ; but now he felt sure he heard an odd sound, as of some one tapping en the side glass of the old hall door. \"She does not return !\" said Heron. \" No, but she will,\" replied Martha. \" A thou sand things might delay her.\" \"No\u2014 no! Oh, heaven, I know what delays her !\" \" You do ?\u2014 you do ? Oh ! what ?\u2014 what ?\" They both asked the question eagerly ; and then pale and sad, and looking dreadfully old and worn, Heron looked up, and said, in tones that terrified them \u2014 \" She is dead I\" \"Dead?\u2014 dead?\" \" Yes, our dear Edith \u2014 my dear Edith is dead I I was sleeping about one honr ago at Severn droog Castle, on Shooter's HUl, close to Black heath, when, in my slumber, I thought I saw Edith ; and then I felt a soft, gentle kiss upon my brow ; bat when I woke up, there was no Edith there.\" Anthony and Martha looked at each other with surprise. \" But it might have been Edith herself,\" said Martha. \" Oh yes, the dear child herself !\" said Anthony. \" I think so too,\" replied Heron ; \" but sha was not in this life. She could not possibly have been there. She would have been seen by my men U she came to the castle and tried to reach that room ; and even if, by some rare combination of circum stances, she had reached it unobserved, it is not possible she could have left it, for my man Ogle"], [196, "190 EDITH HEltON. To reflective minds, there is always sufficient in the past to temper the current of that pesent. But Wild, iu his way, was contented enough. He leaned his neck out at the wiudow of his house ; for it was nearly twelve o'clock, aud at that, time such was the hour at which the wretched, melaucholy processions of death used to start from Ne^ga'.H. From Newgate to the gallows ! Wild expected such a procession on this morn ing. And he built good hopes upon that expectation. A young girl \u2014 almost a child \u2014 was to be legaUy strangled at Tyburn, for passing a forged bill. That she had passed it, there was no doubt; but that she had any guilty knowledge concerning it, there was grave doubt indeed. But that grave doubt did not prevent twelve respectable men from bringing in a verdict of guilty. It did not prevent, too, one of the ablest of the judges from pronouncing sentence of death. And it did not prevent the authorities and tho Crown from leaving the yonng girl to execution. But Jonathan Wild had his own opinion upon the facts of this case. \"Who \u2014 who\u2014 who is it? Who knocks?\" \" It's me, my ancient chickabiddy !\" said a voice. \" Ju*t be so good as to let me in I\" \" Tom\u2014 Tom Ripon ?\" \"To b\u00ab sure!\" \" And E'ith\u2014 Edith?\" \" Here she is, all safe and sound I\" Old Anthony flung the door open, and when he paw Edith on its threshold, his first impulse wa-i to extend his arms, and try to clasp her to hi-< honest old heart; but a rapid second thought of their relative position controlled the impulse, aud he sun\" at her feet in a fit of passionate, joyful tears. \" Back again I \u2014 back agaiu, aud safe ! Tbe dear, dear chiM is safe and well !\" \"Ah!\" said Eiith. \"T shall ba loth, indeed, to go on these night expeditions, if they occasion so much anxiety to those who love me and whom I love !\" Martha now appeared in the hall, and, assuming the privilege of her sex, she flung herself upon the breast of Edith in a transport of delight. \" Goodness me !\" cried Tom Eipon, \" what's all the row about? Nobody seems to mind much whether I have come back all right !\" A bell at this moment rang 6harply. Martha, with a start of alarm, proclaimed that it was Lady Castleneau's bell, and that the old lady must have heard that something unusual was goiog on. That opinion was decidedly in favour of the in nocence of the youug girl. Ba*ed; too, upon a conviction of the guilt of some one else, Jonathan Wild had, in his scheming mind, made that opinion of service to him. Twelve o'clock was pealed forth from the belfry of St. Sepnlohre's Church ; and Wild smiled, chuckled, and rubbed his hands together ; for at the same moment he heard a ring at his house door \u2014 a ring that he had expected and Ustencd for. It was Mrs Ripon, who, in a few minutes, camo to Jonathan WiM to announce a visitor. \" Attend to my dear aunt,\" said Edith. \" But keep my secret still ! I am much fatigued, ami will now seek some rest. My aunt's usual time of rising is not yet for a good four or five hours !\" \" Yes,\" savd Martha. \" Dear Edith, wheu I come to awaken you in the morning, I have something to tell you which I will not tell you now, for fear it should make you so happy, you would not be able to e'eep !\" With these enigmatical words, Martha hastened away. \" Mr. Sydney !\" \"Ah, to be sure!\" said Wild \u2014 \" Mr. Sydney; that is the man ! You will be so good as to show him up here, Mother Ripon.\" Mrs. Ripon, when she was fairly outside tho room door, clenched her fists, and went through a pantomimic performance of punching somebody's head. CHAPTER LXIX. JONATHAN WILD OBTAINS THE SHKVICES OF THE PALE STUDEM IN THE TEMPLE, AND MDCH SUR- PRISES MY LORD WARRINGDALE. Tbat imaginary somebody was Jonathan Wild. But Tom's exemplary mother, although she thought she knew Mr. Wild fully weU, was a long way off from doing so in reality. She thought, too, that by this time she knew the house \u2014 that house which had the ominous namn of \" Little Newgate\" \u2014 perfectly; but she had not the least idea, in reality, of the many hiding places and mysterious arrangements which from time to time Jonathan had made in it. \" I'm sorry,\" said Jonathan Wild, as he sat upon a high stool at odb of his windows in Newgate Stteet, \u2014 \" I'm sorry, now, that I did not save up that rascally lawyer in Es6ex Street-, who tried to poison the air abont me, or blow me up, or some thing of that sort; for he was a clever, unscru pulous, handy sort of fellow What a nice window this is \u2014 a good slant side view of Snow Hill! What's o'clock? Oh, a quarter to twelve ! I always sit here on a Monday morning, when I am not positively on duty in the cavalcade, to see the cart go by to Tyburn I Ha! ha ! There are pretty sights in London 1\" Wild looked pleased. Any one, to gaze for a few seconds on tbe hideous, demoniac face of the great thief- taker, would have come to the conclu sion that, wicked and tortuous as had doubtless been his path in life, things had, on the whole, gone pleasantly and successfully with him. There was that self-satisfied look upon his face, which never can be exhibited but by those who never reflect upon the past years of their exist ence. For example, Mrs. Ripon was quite taken aback when Jonathan Wild touched a spring, and sHd aside one of the smaller panels of the room door, and, looking out, caught her in the midst of that pantomimic punching of his head which she was going through. \" Don't,\" said Wild ; \" it might hurt!\" Mrs. Ripon screamed. \" Yon, I mean,\" added Wild. \" I should not care two straws about it, ma'am I\" \" Oh, you wretoh I\" Mr;. Ripon ran against the balustrades of the staircase on tha left hand, and then bumped ber head against the wall on the other in her confu sion. \" I'm quite sure,\" said Wild, \" you wUl spoil jour beauty ! Just be so good as to 6end up Mr. -Sydney, or he will lose the show.\" In such natures, the present holds sovereign swav."], [197, "EDITH HERON. 191 In a few seconds, a p_le, intellectual-looking young man made his appearance before Wild. There was such a look of intense suffering upon his face, that it would have moved the pity of a fiend. judge by the long tresses of beautiful hair that showed among the soiled etraw. Tbe gay coach contained the Sheriff, who was bound to be present at the fXecutioD. He was reading the morning paper. Custom, and the habit of the age in which he lived, had Indurated the heart of tbat man. But it did not stir the least element of com passion in the mind of Jonathan WUd. Coolly lifting a pipe that he had been smckirpr from the window-sill, Wild commenced smoking again, as if no one were present Then the pale, suffering young man cast him self at the feet of the villanous thief-taker, and iu tones full of anguish \u2014 full of despair and agony, he spoke. \" Save her ! \u2014 oh, save her I You have boasted that you had the power to do so ! Save her I \u2014 save her, and take my lUe! \u2014 my soul \u2014 only save her I\" \" Look !\" said Wild ; \" you can see capitally now.\" The pale young man grasped convulsively the ledge of the window, at which he and Jonathau Wild were, and he crossed himself, while the tears fell fast Hot, scalding tears. \" She does not see me !\" he cried. \" She's gone. to death, and she thinks tbat I have deserted her T Oh, heaven, have mercy upon me !\" \" That will do,\" said Wild ; \" now listen to me\" \" Oh, dear !\" \"Do not speak so \u2014 do not look so! You said you could save her, and men say that you have great power! I implore you to do so, and to make your own conditions 1\" \"Hem!\" \" No, no ! I leave you a legacy of hate and despair, and I go to follow her to death, and tj save her from it I\" \" No, you don't.\" \" What shall 6tay me ?\" \" Ha ! ha ! Excuse me laughing, but the fact is, this house is very like a mouse-trap.\" \" A mouse-trap \" \" Yes ; it is a wonderful deal easier to get into it than to get out. Now, here jou are !\" \" But\u2014 but \" \" Oh, heaven, he hesitates ! \u2014 this man who boasted of the power to snatch from death that young, fair, innocent being, who has done na ill!\" \" My good sir,\" said Wild, as he smoked with great ease and composure, \u2014 \" my good sir, it is twelve o'clock.\" \" Pho ! pho ! hear me out. You fancy that you have nothing to do but to leave when you like, and go scampering up Holborn Hill after that procession to T j burn, but I tell you it is no such thing.\" \" What shaU stay me ? I ask again, what shall stay me ?\" \" I\u2014 Jonathan Wild !\" \" Oh, heaven, yes !\" \" H_rk !\" Clang ! claDg ! clang! tolled the death-bell of Newgate solemnly and awfully. Every vibration seemed to strike upon the heart of that pale young man. He writhed upon the floor at the feet of Jonathan Wild, and he uttered short, half-stifled screams of anguish. \" You ? \u2014 you ? \" I, aud no other! By a private signal, I have let my bull-dogs in tbe lower part of tha hous . know that you are not to be permitted to leave without express orders from me. You are, in fact, my prisoner.\" \" Villain !\" \" Any one would think,\" said Wild, \" that you were killed.\" \"IamkUled!\" \" Pho ! pho !\" \" I see now ! You will not help me ! Perhaps you cannot, and your affected power to do so was aU a delusion ! But I can die with her !\" \" Oh, you can amu=e yourseU by calling me what bad names you like. They break no bones.\" \"Stuff!\" \" I wUl\u2014 I will ! At least, I can perform an act that shall give a grace to the last breath tha.t vivifies this mortal frame ! \u2014 I wiU confess my own guilt, and save her!\" \" And kill your mother and yonr two orphan sisters ?\" said Wild, calmly. The pale young man groaned, and sobbed, and beat his head a gains' the floor. \" My good friend,\" eaid Wild, \" you will make your head ache, and that will do you no good.\" \" My heart aches \u2014 my poor heart will never cease to ache.\" \" Wretch I Monster !\" \"Ha! ha! What are yon?\" \"What\u2014 am\u2014 I?\" \"Yes. Forger ! betrayer ! coward!\" The pale young man seemed to shrink within himself, so to speak, as Wild uttered these words, \u2014 giving them, by the dimness aud coolness with which he pronounced them, a more terrible signi ficance than as if he had yelled them forth at the tip top of a passion. The pale young man had faced Wild with some appearance of defiance in his looks, but now be fell to the floor in a huddled up fashion, and seemed completely to give up all hope. Wild deliberately knncked the tobacco ashes from his pipe, as he now, in a quiet, equable tone of voice, spoke. \" Your name is George Sydney. You are a young banister of the Temple. Your days anil nights have been spent in study until you have injured your constitution, and made yourself the white spectre of a man that you are!\" \"Alas!\u2014 alas!\" \" Don't interrupt me. You have acquired such a knowledge of the law, I am told, that your opinion of any case is of the greatest value, and jour advocacy of it almost a patent of success. \" That's quite another thing. Come, now, and look out of the window with me. You get a tolerable side-view of Snow Hill, right past the church. Listen !\" Clang ! clang ! clang ! went the death-bell. 61owly past the corner of the Old BaUey there came the head cf a procession. Some mounted constables, a cart, some more mounted constables, a very gay coach, then more constables, and then a grea*. crowd. That was the procession to Tyburn. In the cart there was something that might be human. It was a figure lying huddled up on the straw that was in aud partly lying over the coffin, that formed one object of its contents.

Eh ?\" \" Oh, mercy ! \u2014 mercy !\" \"Stuff!\" \"But her ogony ! \u2014 her terror!\u2014 her mental distress I\" \" Oh, ah ! I comprehend. You want to be off, and so jou shall.

You have eaid what is equal to that \u2014 you have boat-ted that yoa can give me the means of saving her I\" \u00ab I can !\" JONATHAN WILD TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP TO SUBSTANTIATE HIS CLAIM TO THE WHITCOMBE PEERAGE. The facts in connexion with the young barrister. Mr. Sydney, were pretty much as Jonathan Wild had detailed them; and the reason why he had in terested himself in saving the life of the innocent young girl was just what he had shortly Btated it to be. \" And you will\u2014 you will ? \u2014 oh, only say you will, and beep jour word, aud you eee before you one who will be your slave for life !\u2014 who will go through anything to repiy you! Only say that you will save her I\" \"That will do!\" He felt tbe importance of having a first-rate legal adviser, who dared not shrink from his cause, or in any way play him false. In this Mr. Sydney, with his vast legal know ledge, he found just the right person. After thus despatching him on the errand of mercy to the poor condemned girl, who was on her route to Tyburn, apparently without a hope of escaping the dreadful doom that awaited her, Wild sallied out of the house on another errand. \" What? What will do ?M \"Just what you say, Mr. Sydney I I have iu hand a legal business, which wants the assistance of just such a mau as you are. Promise me that assistance, and I will not only save the girl, but will keep yonr secret, which is that of the real criminal, and which, any Old Bailey Sessions, wonld be sufficient to place you in similar circum stances to those which she is in now !\" The pale young man shook iu every limb. 11 What do yon require ? What is it?' \"Never mind what it is just now. Will you swear hy all tbat you hold sacred By the bye, do yon h.ld anything sacred ?\" \"I do\u2014 Ir'o!\" That errand was to ferret out the hiding-place of Lord Warringdale. Wild had become by this time quite convinced that Warringdale had escaped the lingering and terrible death, he, Jonathan, had intended for him in the vault of Westminster Abbey, but where he was exactly, he did not know. He had a clue, however, to his hiding-place. For such a man as Wild to have a real clue to anything, was to be a good two- thirds on the way to its discovery. Wild beto>k himself to an obscure court at the hack of Swallow Street, which was the thorough- fare that occupied the site of the now stately Regent Street in London. There, in a wretched house, let out in mean lodgings, he knew he shonld find Captain Target, as Le Jeune chose to name himself \" Then swear by it that you will be faithful to me, and act for my interests as I require yon !\" \"And if I do, you will save her?\" \"I will!\" \"It is uot fro Me?\" \" Not at all ! She is only on Holborn HUl by this tit-ie!\" \" Then I swear !\" \"Very good!\" Wild leant out at the open window, and blew a whistle loudly. From a court at the opposite side of the way of Newgate Street, a man emerged, mounted on a powerful grey horse, and leading another by the bridle. The down-hill career of the old Bishop of Wor cester's secretary had been rapid. From bad, Le Jeune had got to worse; and since the physical disaster that had overtaken him in St James's Street he had been pretty nearly laid up. Jonathan made his way up a pestiferous stair- Jonathan plnuped his hand into one of his capa cious pocket*, and drew out a folded paper. \"This.\" ha said, \"is a free pardon for the joung woman in whom you are interested.\""], [199, "EDITH HERON. fery, so he replied with an affectation of great candour, \"Then, Mr. Wild, I look just what I feel, although the looks of a sick man may not alwavs express the true mental emotions that actuate him.\" \" Came, come!\" said Wild ; \" don't let you and I try to make fools of each other. Where is Warringdale?\" \" Warringdale ?\" \" Yes ; I want to know where he is, and no man has a better chance of giviDg a good guess case to the top of tbe house, and listened at several attic doors before he turned tbe handle of one. There was Le Jeune, lying on a wretched truckle bed, suffering a great deal of pain. Wild assumed a very favourite attitude with him when in a strange room, which was to place a chair against the door and sit dowu in it. Le Jeune started up in his bed at the entrance cf Jonathan WUd, and looked at him with terrified eyes. Wild nodded. \"How do? AU right, eh?\" at tbat fact than yon.\" \" I don't know.\" \"Well, then, it cant ba helped. The fifty guineas go into some one else's pocket, that's all. \"Mr. Wild?\" \" Oh, ye', I am Mr. Wild. I don't think any one who has once had the pleasure of my acquaintance is at all likely to forget me.\" \"No \u2014 oh, no ! I am so glad to see you !\" \" Yon look so !\" Goodbye!\" \"Stop! Stop!\" \"What is it?\" \" What do you mean by the fifty guineas ? \" Just that tha- is the sum I will give to any Le Jeune was a tolerable master of finesse, and almost the equal of Wild himself in cool effron- No. 25.\u2014 Edith. 193"], [200, "EDITH HERON. 194 foolish shot iu the Angel Inn yard, where you thought you had me securely in a sedan chair ; but that I forgave.\" \"Hem!\" \" Oh, yes !

But U I succeed, aud get the title and estates, yon shall be liberated, and I will treat you hand somely, always provided I find that whUe here you have given me good advice.\" \"And if not?\" \"Why, then, I shall some evening cut your throat, and have you buried in the floor of this cell. one who wiU enable me to place my hand upon the shoulder of my Lord Warringdale.\" \" Done ! I wiU do it.\" \" I was sure you would.\" \"Do you know a house\u2014 a gaming-house in Bury Street, St. James's\u2014 which goes by the name of Slivoni's Cellar ?\" \" Do I know it ?\" \" WeU, of course you do. I will get up to night, whether I am able or not, I was going to say ; but in pain or out of pain, I wUl get up and meet you there at midnight, when I will show you Warringdale.\" \"Agreed!\" \" But I am desperately poor.\" \" Oh, don't let that vex you. There is some gold ou account ; I can trust you. Good day ! That will do. Don't fail me ; but of course you Will not!\" M I should not wonder,\" said Boom. \"Come, now, what do you want to know ?\" \" What mnst I first do ?\" \"Gftup carefully the genealogy\u2014 the Une of descent\" \" And how set about it ?\" \" Forge some letters ; have an old tombstone or two made, and suborn some witnesses.\" \" What next ?\" \"Then; you should takft the original doonment which we had possession of, and which was fonnd in. tta\u00bb tomb in Westminster Abbey, and get it stamped by some- high legal functionary, if possible; or, if not, get* notary publio to put bis seal upon it, so that it may be for ever identified.\" \" Very good !\" '\"\"Anything, else?\" \"Nott at present. By the bye, Boom, I have been to your chambers in the Temp),-\" \"I expi-cted ae much.\" \"And there, no doubt, as yovi may guess, I mado some interesting discoveries' \"It is likely.\" \"Good da., Boom !\" \"Good day, Wild!\" Jonathan picked up hiatbre .-legged stonl. and left the cell, carefully fastening the door behind him. WUd was quite certain that Le Jenne would ket p his word, and he started off to the City again, to hear at Newgate what was the talk about the pardon of the yonng girl. He found that Mr. Sydney had been quite suc cessful, having duly overtaken the cart bound for Tyburn at the top of Holborn; and the Sheriff had been only too glad to get rid of a disagreeable duty, and likewise to get horns in time for lun chson. WUd smiled. \"I hive him!\" he said; \"I have him, what may be caUed, body and soul now I\" Jonathan did not trouble the young barrister any more that day; but he paid a visit to Mr. Boom in his mAsft uncomfortable cell. Jonathan brought a smaU three-legged stool with him into Boom!\u00bbprison-chamfcer, and se\u00bbting himsetf by the door; he said, \" Boom, I. want your advicfti^ \" Certaitdy, Mt. Wfld.'r \"Oh, yon areman amiable mood, are you?\" \"Why not? ASrt.I not boe_ded and lodged as* your dbmestte lawyer, Mr. Wild?\" There wa* a. cool, grinning sort of sarcMm about Boom's mannerwiiich Wild ratheradmiwd; aud he admired, too, the courage of the man who would not give way before the terrore and the perils of his situation. \" Boom, if I could only trust you it wonld give me a great deal of pleasure; but siooe you have set yourself as a competitor with me for the-earl dom of Whitcombe, you are too dangerous I\" \" I give in ! I give up to you !\" Wild shook his head. \" No, Boom\u2014 no, you don't, and no you won't ! Why should you, if you can do otherwise, I should like to know? No, no! Neither you nor I, as we both well know, have the shadow of a claim to this peerage; but under the circumstances, if we eau by fraud, forgery, chicanery, and rascality, persuade the world to the contrary, all is well.\" \" Bettor than well !\" \" This ocnduot of Boom is unnatural.\" be said to himself. \" I consider him more dangerous everyday I ' Boom; clutched his hands, and made the most horrible contortions of countenanee; expressive of silent. r\u00bbge, after Wild had left him; and then he carefully grabbed up from tho- floor of tbe oell a Urge nail, upon which he gaead for a long time. It was all, now, that Boom had left in the way of a tool or a weapon with which to work his way to freedom. Jonathan Wild waited with some impatience for night to come ; and, at about a quarter past eleven, he made his way towards tne natniug house which had been mentioned by Le Jeune. The house was not one of the first of its class, but it was stiU one in which at times very large sums of money were lost and won. Jonathan had, to a certain extent, disguised himself, although that was one of the things which he could never succeed in well. The peculiar and marked expression of bis features made it quite ont of the question for auy one to forget him who had once trad a good look at him. \" Just so I want to take measnres to prove, or to teem to prove, that Jonathan Wild has really a tight to the name of Mowbray, and that I am tha lineal descendant of the younger branoh of the Whitcoaibe family, which, failing a male heir to th. earldom and estates from the elder branch, cosaes into the .succession, you see, Boom.\" \"Exactly, WUd!\" \" Well, you want to do the same thing.\" This was an advantage in some respects to such a mau as Jonathan Wild, aud ha ha now sought to maiuttiu his supremacy over the world of kuavery by the terror of his mauuer, it md well enough; but whenever, as H sometimes happened, he wished to go in couc.almeut, some times, of course, it was against him. \" I did.\" \"And do still; so I shall keep you seoure here, you see, as my lawyer, always at home! You tried to put me out of the way by that"], [201, "195 EDITH PEEON, But still Jonathan Wild, on this occasion, put on a suit of black, and a dingy white cravat, which he pulled a good way up over his chin; and that, with some false whiskers\u2014 for he had none in reality \u2014 aud a wig of a very different coloured hair to tha little tuft on his head, made up what might bo called a disguise. The popularity of the gaming-house where he was to meet Le Jeuna consisted a good deal in tbe fact that it was not at aU exclusive. As he spoke, Wild caught up one of the cards from the table and pinned it to the wall, so that when the gaming-house keeper and a couple of his assistants made a rush into the room, in a few moments expecting to see some ghastly suicide from the pistol-shot, they fonnd Wild aiming a pistol, apparently, at the jack of clubs against the wall, and saying, \" Now it is my turn.\" \"What!\" cried the gaming-house keeper, in a rage, \" do you think I allow this sort of play in my house?\" \"My good friend,\" said Wild, \"we did not think about it, but if you object, we will go. Come on, old acquaintance ; I have something particular to say to you\" Wild drew the arm of the bewildered Lord Warringdale within his own, and walked him out of the gaming-house without further resistance. \"Mr. Wild! Mr. Wild!\" said Warringdale; \" have I not every possible reason to be distrust ful of yon, and to try to avenge the treachery with which you have treated me?\" \"Ob, nonsense \u2014 nonsense!\" \"You know that what I say is true\" \" Well, then, I too wiH tell you a truth, whioh you shall have ample leisure to reflect upon.\" As he spoke, Wild blew his whistle, and just as two of his men appeared, he dealt Warringdale a blow with the short bludgeon he had concealed about him, which struck him down insensible. \" Get a hacknev coach, or a sedan chair, and take him to Little Newgate. I shaU be there as soon.\" Everybody who hud any money to lose, might walk in freely, aud accomplish that object. No trust was given, and there was no gambling there upon credit, as in someof the more aristocratic gaming-houses of Lendon, where a young mau or an old man might lose an estate that was, perhaps, a good hundred miles off. If any disappointed trickster ventured on the chances of winning, and cried out a stake which he had not tha cash to meet if he lost, the con sequences were summary aud uncomfortable. The whole room would set upon him, and if he \"scaped being thrown ont of the windows, his -;ood fortune might be considered to be in the as ct-ndant Suoh was tbe house, then, to which Jonathan Wild went to keep his appointment with Le Jeune, aud meet with Lord Warringdale. The saloon, as the principal room wan .ailed, was full of company. Wild looked curiously about him for some time without beiug able to find Le Jeune. At last he asked one of the table attendants for Captain Target. \" Oh, the Captain is in number six up-stairs, sir,\" was the prompt reply. \" Thank you That wiU do.\" It appeared that the upper rooms of the house were devoted to private play, where small parties might ruin each other with secrecy, and without being the gaze of all the lookers tn and general players at the public table. Wild accordingly went up to number six, and openiDg the door very quietly, he looked in. Two people only were there, playing at piquet. One was Le Jeune. CHAPTER LXXT.

When Felix Heron left Castleneau Home it was with so much despair and consternation at his heart, that he could scarcely be said to be master of himself. The other looked Uke an aged man, with a head of grey hair, and a very shabby old roquelaire cloak wrapped about him. But Wild recognised my Lord Warringdale at ODCP. He had bat one dominant idea, and that was that he must make the best of his way back to Blackheath, in order to learn the fate of Edith. That something terrible had happened to her was tbe conviction than forced itself upon him, and the anguish that he now endured was a fear ful set-off against the wrongful doubts he had en tertained of the faithfulness of poor Edith. And yet the reader must not condemn Felix Heron for those donbts. There was a mirror exactly opposite to the door, and fating Lord Warringdale ; so that, hear ing the door open, he looked up, and saw WUd's face reflected in it. He sprang from his chair in a moment, and flinging it down, he placed his back against the wall nearest at hand, and drew a pistol. \" You are a dead man, Jonathan Wild,\" he said, \" if you attempt to lay a hand on me !\" WUd smUed. What could he think, when ha had the evidence of his own senses to the fact that Edith had had a visitor, to whom she seemed to be parting with those very jewels which had been the special gift of him, Captain Heron ? But now he altogether blamed himself, which was just what a generous mind was sure to do. The daylight was coming over the hUls by the time Captain Heron and Daisy once more reached Blackheath. \" My Lord Warringdale, you make a great mis take I do not come here as an enemy, but to hail you as Earl of Whitcombe. The King in CouncU has come to a resolution.\" \"What? Eh? I?\" Warringdale was thrown off his guard. Jona than WUd made one terrific leap upon, and dashed up. the hand and arm that carried the pistol, which exploded, and lodged the bullet in the ceil ing. \u2022' Don't be a fool !\" said Wild. \" Our interests aio t 'ill in common, and the past, to men like us, should always be forgotten whenever it interferes with the present.\" A cold, white mist was over the surface of the common, giving it very much the aspect of a great white sea, fringed only in the far distance by woods. Indeed, so thick was this morning mist, that Felix Heron could not distinguish Shooter's Hill at all. Pausing to look about him, for some sort of landmark which would lead him aright, he be-"], [202, "196 EDITH 11L..0.N. came conscious of some moving objects that oc cupied a considerable space, coming slowly through the vapour. What those objects could be, he was at first at a loss to discover, but in a few minutes he made up his mind that tney must be cattle, turned out of some of the farm-yards in the neighbourhood to early pasture. Still, however, he thought it would be prudent not to be seen even by some simple herdsman, and he alighted from Daisy. Holding, then, the bridle in his hand, he looked to the ground at his feet anxiously for some path or other indication of the various routes across the heath. very materially decreased the distance between him and the horsemen, and was able to hear some words which were of the deepest possible interest to him. \" I am quite sure, \" said one, \" that we are off the track. These fogs, which are so frequent in the morning on the heath, are most contusing.\" \" No ; we are right,\" said another. \" Yes,\" snarled a voice, that made Felix Heron give a sudden start, and almost forced an excla mation from him that might have betrayed him \u2014 \" yes, dispute about the road, do, till there comes a gleam of morning sun, and away goes the mist, like a burnt scroll in the fire I\" The speaker of these words was none other than Jonathan WUd. Coming, then, suddenly upon several bushes of ths yellow gorse, which were in full bloom, Felix Heron was at onoe enabled to decide the points of the compass. He knew that the blossom of the gorse would be most abundant on the side next to the south, and that indication was quite sufficient to guide him on his proper route towards Shooter's HiU. But when he looked up again, he saw the dark moving objects through tbe mist once more. They were decidedly closer to him. From the movements, then, of the animals which he had taken to be cattle, he felt now convinced that they were horses, and that they had riders on their backs. His harsh, croaking voice could never be mis taken by Captain Heron. Surely, it could no longer now be a matter of doubt what had brought Wild to Blackheath. Was it not to arrest him, Heron ? Bapidly did Heron think back upon the pro ceedings of the last four-and-twenty hours, and then he told himself that he had been wrong to allow Lord Warriogdale to escape, on any terms whatever; for he felt convinced that he owed his present danger to him. But Felix Heron was not the man to stand idly by and bemoan some peril, without trying to meet it, and overcome it No sooner did he feel assured that Jonathan Wild, with a large party, was upon the heath. than he felt the necessity of making his way to tbe castle on Shooter's liill, with all speed. The voice of Wild, however, again soundiug in those harsh, well-known grating tones, arreited him for the moment, as he wished to hear what the arch- villain had to say. The rolling vapour was so thick, that now and then it seemed completely to mix up these men and these horses in one mass of confusion. Then, again, it would thin a little, so that he could define each form, and more than once he began to count the mounted men. In this effort at enumeration, however, he was baffl -d always by the rapidly moving mist Captain Heron, however, felt convinced that there were more than thirty mounted men npon the common. \"No other plan could have succeeded,\" said Wild. \" The mist is the only ally we have in reaching the hill without being observed ; but if we look sharp, wa shall get securely among the trees before any look-out from the castle can see us.\" What were they there for ? What could their business be, at such an hour, in so lonely a place ? Those questions interested him deeply. But he had not much time to cogitate upon them, for a voice from one of the horsemen sounded strangely through the fog, and demanded all his attention. \" Yes, Mr. Wild, I know that,\" said another of tha party. \" But you are a wiser man than I am if you can show me the proper path to Shooter's Hill.\" \" Follow me !\" growled Wild. \" I have seen my way through worse fogs than this \" From a movement among the mounted men in the mist, Felix Heron could see that there was some alteration in the line of march, and then, as they moved further from him, he heard Wild's voice once more. \" I see something yonder,\" said the voice. \"Halt!\" cried another. \" Now I see it again.\" \"What is it?\" \" I don't know ; a stray horse or a cow \u2014 I think the latter, as it is alone.\" From these words, Captain Heron began to think that it was Daisy, whom he was leading by the bridle, tbat was alluded to. He hit npon a plan of settling the scruples of the mau who spoke, as to whether it was a horse or a cow he saw through the mist, in an ingenious fashion. \" Remember, it's five hundred pounds reward for Heron, the highwayman !\" \"Ay, ay, Mr. Wild!\" \" And the reward is payable, alive or dead \" Jonathan Wild placed such an emphasis on the word \" dead,\" that no one could possib'y mis take that he meant the reward would be paid much more cheerfully for the dead than the living Heron, tbe highwayman. It was with that wonderful cat-like sagaoity which he possessed to so great an extent, that Wild now led the strong mounted, and no doubt well armed, party with him across the heath, to wards Shooter's Hill. Heron executed an exact imitation of the faint lowing of a cow. \" Ah, it is a cow !\" cried the voice. Heron, then, by holding the bridle in a pecu liar way, got Daisy to depress her head, so that, through the mist, she might pass for a cow very well to those who were now already prepossessed with the idea that she was one. Felix Heron followed. He thought that he might, by approaching nearer to the mounted party, ascertain what they were, and what objects they had in showing them selves npon the old heath at such an hour. Slowly, then, creeping on, FeUx H.ron Boon He could now comprehend Wild's tactics well enough. They were, to get into ambush and con cealment among the trees and brushwood about the castle, before the mist should disappear, and then wait for his prey."], [203, "197 EDITH HERON. sure, now, that aU wUl end well, and that we shall soon again see you and the Lady Edith, aa wa U9ed to see you, walking about among the old trees.\" That prey was to be Captain Heron and his band. \" No,\" said Heron, to himself\u2014\" no ; villain and miracle of cunning and ferocity as you are, I will still baffle you, and disappoint you of this morning's work!\" Still keeping Daisy in the same attitude which made her so much resemble a cow, Heron, by keeping on the outskirts of Wild's party, slowly, but surely, approached the old castle on Shooter's Hill. \" Heaven grant you may 1\" Felix Heron then detailed to Ogle exactly what he had heard and seen upon tbe heath, and con cluded by sayingtohim, \u2014 \"You will leave thecastlo and its grounds by the route that will take you right over the brow of the hill, so that you will entirely escape from Jonathan WUd and his men ; and you will remember, I daresay, that you and I, in ex ploring the castle, found in one of the coach houses an ancient, covered kind of chaise; \u2014 in that you will convey, carefully wrapped in all the clothing of her bed, my mother 1\" \" It shall be done, Captain \" \" You see, Ogle, how much I leave to you, and how much I trust to you!\" \" All shall be done, Captain, as you wish, so long as life is left me 1\" \"I know it \u2014 I know itl And now, Edith, I will to in search of thee!\" Heron, although he was so anxious to make all the inquiries possible about the heath, for Edith, was not so hurried or bewildered as to set about doing so without proper precaution for his own safety. He felt that his safety might likewise be the safety of Edith. Making his way hastily, then, to the room in the castle which he had for so short a time occu pied, he made what rapid alteration he could in his costume, preparatory to sallying out in search oi her who was more than ever, il that were pos sible, his heart's treasure. It will be seen that the ride from London to Blackheath had had one beneficial effect upon the mind of Felix Heron. \" Halt !\" cried Wild, suddenly. The moving throng of spectre-like horsemen .came to a stand-still. \" Now,\" added Wild, \" let every one dismount and lead his horse. Here we are at the foot of the hill, and there is plenty of cover on both sides. Come on I\" They all dismounted ; and Felix Heron, as he strained his eyes to watch their movements through the miat, saw them one by one disappiar as if they had sunk into tbe earth, or dissolved into air, and mingled with the vapour that rolled np the hill-side. \" Now,\" said Heron, as he took a side path up the hill himself with Daisy, \u2014 \" now, to save my self, my men, and last, though not least, my poor mother !\" Perfectly well acquainted as he was with the whole locality, Heron had no difficulty in making his way with secrecy and expedition into the grounds of the caBtle with Daisy. Faintly he sounded the silver whistle that he <bad with him thrice, and then Ogle met him at the hall porch. \" It is you. Captain ?\" \" It is, Ogle. Take Daisy for a few secinds.\" \"Ah, Captain! I can guess, from the tone of your voice, that all is not well.\" \" No, Ogle ; all is not well. My heart is a prey to contending emotions, and I am distracted by many doubts and fears.\" \"Of Edith!\" ' It had dissipated that terrible suggestion of his fevered imagination, which had come over him at CastlenoaH House, that Edith was no more. A firmer faith in the goodness of that Provi dence which had hitherto guarded her through so many perils, had come over him, and he believed tbat his Edith lived, although possibly surrounded by dangers. Little did he think that, at that very moment he emerged from the castle on Shooter's Hill, attired in a costume which made him look like a substan tial farmer, Edith was in a deep, calm, and dream less sleep, beneath the shelter of her aunt's house in Bloomsbury. But so it was. \" Heaven bless her, and in its abundant mercy cast over her the shield of its protection ! \" \" Amen !\" \" I know, my good friend, that yon want to ask me if I have seen her, and if all is well ; so I will reply to you that I have not, and that all is not well. Poor, poor Edith ! dear Edith!\" \" Captain ! Captain ! you frighten a fellow ! What has happened ? \u2014 what is amiss ?\" \"Edith is somewhere searching for me, and Jonathan Wild is on thecommon \u2014 indeed, I ought to say, on Shooter's HiU\u2014 with a force of about thirty men.\" Ogle drew a long breath upon receiving this alarming intelligence. \" What's to be done, Captain ? Poor, dear Edith, too ! How are we to find her ?\" \" Ogle, I must \u2014 I wiU find her ! You must now act for me with all your usnal spirit and determi nation. I cannot leave the heath, since it is just possible that Edith may be wandering somewhere about it ; but what you wUl have to do is to con duct tbe band in safety from this no longer tenable home.\" It seemed as if a malignant destiny \u2014 now that, by a series of strange accidents, Edith and Felix Heron had become temporarily estranged and separated \u2014 delighted in protracting their unhap piness. Before he left the castle, however, Heron took one glance at the pale, suffering face of his poor mother, whose mind, for the last day and night, had shown more symptoms of failing than he Uked even to admit to himself that he observed. She was now, however, tranquUly sleeping ; and he left her with one kiss, which did not dis turb the repose of the poor sufferer. Then he rode out upon the gallant and faithful Daisy, well armed, and prepared for any adventure that might present itseU to him. The last words of Heron to Ogle were, \" Expect me at the forest on the third night from tbat which is coming, unless something serious and unusual should detain me.\" Ogle wrung the hand of Heron, but said not a \"Whereto?\" \" To Epping Forest again.\" Ogle gave quite a shout of pleasure at the sound cf those words. \" Ah, yes, Captain !\" he said ; \" we are always safe, always happy, and always lucky and pros perous at the old forest and it rejoices my heart to iiear of your goiog back to it once again. I feel"], [204, "198 EDITH HERON. word. He kne v the important trust that was re posed in him, and the duty he had to perform in the absence of Captain Heron ; and he set about it with a determination that it should be no fault of his if it were not performed well and satisfac torily. Before the white mist had cleared away from the heath, Ogle, with the band, and Amelia Staun ton, in the covered chaise, had left the old castle on Shooter's HUl. defiant voice, \" Captain Felix Heron, I summon you to surrender to the law. Resistance is mad ness against my force, and can only bring death and destruction upon all who may be misled to aid you !\" Wild looked keenly about him as he spofca. with the full expectation of seeing somethi \u00bbj tc of Felix Heron, quietly, in which case, be meant to try at once two pistol-shots at his head. But all was still. The echo of his own voice was the only re sponsive sound that came upon his ears. A couple of his men now joined him, and they looked rather blankly about them. \" It strikes me, Mi'. Wild,\" said one, \"tbat we have been misled, aud thai mere is no one here !\" CHAPTER LXXII. JONATHAN WILD FINDS THAT HE HAS ACHIEVED A BARREN CONQUEST; BUT, BT A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE, BECOMES SUCCESSFUL BEYOND HIS HOPES. \"Nonsense, cried Wild \"My information was certain ! The rascals are hiding, but I will fine, them, if I hava to pull the whole house down brick by brick, and stone by sfooe!\" Jonathan Wild now dismounted ; aud, tetherirg his horse to the balustrades at the foot of tha principal staircase leading from the hall, he went to the porch, and called to his men. \" Sr.t a watch at every door and every window you come to, Atkins!\" '\u2022 Yes, Mr. Wild.'\" In a secure covert, among the old trees aud 1/ushes that so plentifully fringed each side of the road up Shooter's Hill, Jonathan Wild and the troop of men he had with him waited for the mist, which still roll__ in masses of fleecy vapour over the hc.-io, to disperse. He thought he had Felix Heron iu a trap. That trap, it amused him to reflect, was tbe castellated residence on the hill which formed port of the Whitcombe property. Part of that properly that Jonathan Wild was not without a sanguine hope of making all his own on some fine day soon. It was about nine o'clock in the morning before the white fog began to rise. Slowly the vapour lifted itself up from tho surface of the common as a light keen wind swept over from the north-east. \" Two of you follow me, and keep your pistols in your hands, ready for inr.taut use 1\" Tbis was done ; and, in the course of an hour, Wild had pretty well been over tha castle, ami was beginning to come to the conclusi n tbat, although he had found the nest, the birds were. flown. He ground his teeth with rage as he descended to the hall again, aud glared about him, not knowing well wh .t next to do. That he was foiled, he could no longer corc-iil from himself ; for, although he found evidences enough of the recent occupation of the castle, ho was quite sure, from tbe absence of the horses, that tferon av.d his band had it ft il. Then in whirling masses it seemed to mingla in wild confusion, like some whirlpool in au ocean, after which it rapidly scattered. The whole process of its departure did not occupy ten minutes, and then it was gone, no eye could trace whereabouts. Then Wild turned .on his heels, aud bit his lip, and uttered terrible imprecations at his own bad luck. Jonaiban Wild called out aloud to the strong party he had with him, \" Hurrah ! the tine has come ! Ho was about to order a retreat from the casll. then, when the man Atkins, who seemed to net as a sort of lieutenant to him, came into the hall, saying, \" Mr. Wild, there is a carriage coming aero. y the heath, and it seems to be making its way directly towards this place!\" \" What carriage ! Bah I Bo! It don't matter to us. Our man is not likely to coma to this house of his in such a vehicle Where is it?\" \" ' TJprouse ye, then, my merry, merry men, For it is our opeDing day.' \"' Clapping spurs, then, to his horse, he leapt alow fence, and found himself in the grounds of the castle. With confidence in their own numbers and strength, well armed as they all were, Jonathau's troop followed him cheerfully. \" Give them a cheer !\" cried Wild. \"You may see it now, Mr. Wild, through this opening in tho trees, if yon stand upou this old stump.\" Wild looked curiously at the approachiuj carriage, which was an old-fashioned, rathe lumbering sort of vehicle, and seemed to be mak ing its way across the heath as directly as tbe roads would permit it, towards the caBtle. Wild placed his finger on his brow. \" Where ?\" he said, \u2014 \" where have I seen that carriage before ?\" The shape, the size, the colour \u2014 all tbe general aspects and appearances of that vehicle, so far out of the then present fashion as it was, seemed to be familiar to him as though he had seen it in a dream- The cheer was given with right good will, for Wild was quite clear in his own mind that to attempt to achieve anything by further conceal ment of who and what he was would be of no avail, so he advanced boldly to the attack. His heart sunk a litUe at the silence with which his approach was met \"Keep wide, my m'n!\" he cried. \"Scatter! scatter ! The rascals may open a fire upon ns, for all we know, soon ; and you will stand less chance of mischief if you are not eo close together.\" The troop obeyed this injunction, so literally in deed, that they approached the actual castle at almost every point. As for Wild himself, who so s-eldom knew what fear was, he found his way right up to the front porch, and although he was alone for some seconds, he rode on horseback right into the pived hall, with a pistol in each hand, oalUng out, in a loud, The vehicle rapidly approached. Then Jonatban WUd nttered a cry of gratifica tion as he called out, \" Keep under cover, ali us you ! Keep close ! I will send a pistol-shot at \u2022.!.\u00ab-"], [205, "KDITH HERON. 199 first head I see visihle ! There is some good luck in store for us yet!\" Wild was rapidly obeyed. The horses were pushed into the barns, stables, and outhonses, and in the course of five minutes, Jonathan Wild and all his men were snugly hidden from observation. He took good care himself, though, to occupy a post which enabled him to get a good view of the approaching carriage which he had so opportunely recognised, and which probably the reader has already guessed belonged to Lady Castleneau. And now we must explain to the reader how this antiquated vehicle, which was only brought into requisition by Edith's aunt on what she con sidered important occasions, came to be on Black heath on this eventful morniDg. Martha, the servant of Lady Castleneau, with all the well-meaning in the world, had made a great mistake in not at once communicating to Edith, on her return to Castleneau House, the visit there of Felix Heron. But Martha was so tenderly attached to Edith, that the look of exhaustion and fatigue she saw upon her face alarmed her. If she told her of Captain Heron's visit, and of what he said, she, Edith, might at once take it into her head to ride forth again in search of him. The thought of that was what Martha could not bearr 60 she saved her communication until the morning, when Edith should be rested. \" Yes, dear aunt, and I guess what that one thing is I\" \" You do, dear Edith, I can see by your haste to dress ; bnt you must breakfast first and then we will go to Shooter's Hill, in search of the Earl of Whitcombe, your dear husband.\" Edith would gladly have started at once, but Lady Castleneau was inflexible on the subject of breakfast ; and Edith was more reconciled to the delay when she heard her aunt order old Anthony to put the horses into the old carriage, for she knnw that that was a process which would occupy the better part of one hour. _ But all things that are to be wiU come in due time, and we may conclude the breakfast at Castle neau House despatched\u2014 a happier one than has been partaken of there for some time \u2014 and the old carriage rumbling over the court-yard and out of the gate, on its route to Blackheath, where Edith soon hoped to be again united to her much-loved Felix Heron- Jonathan WUd chuckled with delight as he saw the old coach of Lady CasUeneau reach the foot of Shooter's Hill. He had no doubt in the world in respect to the errand of that coach there, and he had very little doubt in respect to its occupants. That Edith was there, and that in all probability her aunt, Lady Castleneau, was with her, appeared to WUd quite a feasible proposition. He did not scruple or hesitate a moment as to what he should do. Jonathan Wild was playing a high game for enormous stakes, and he was resolvtd to leave no stone unturned that would give him a prospect of winning. Already had he secured two opponents in tho cells of his house in Newgate Street Mr. Boom, as we know, is there, with no hope pf release, except in one old nail. Lord Warringdale, too, is there, and occupies the very next cell to the lawyer from the Temple. If, then, he, WUd, could only get Edith there and Lady Castleneau, then he would feel like some great conquerer who had captured all his enemies, and had them securely under lock and key. And what now was to prevent him ? There were Lady Castleneau and Edith actually coming, as it were, to throw themselves into his hands, as fast as the two well-fed, lightly worked, but rather lazy horses in that antiquated carriage could bring them. No wonder that Wild chuckled. Good news should never be saved up. EvU tidings will at times keep for some period, and should, indeed, be kept as long as possible; but it will be seen that Martha, by delaying the communication she had to make, placed not only Edith, but her kind and indulgent mistress, Ladv Castleneau, in a position of very great peril. It was to Lady Castleneau herself that Martha related all that happened; and it was the good, kind-hearted old gentlewoman, who thereupon insisted upon goiDg to Edith's chamber, and awakening her at once, if need were, to hear the welcome gews. Lady Castleneau had a notion that you should break gently bad news, but that you could not tell good news in too few words. Arousing Edith, then, by a kiss and an embrace, she said, \" My dear child, Felix has been here, and he says that now he sees aU his error, and knows everything, and only hopes that you wUl be to him the same dear, loving Edi h yon have ever b;en ; and he recants and retracts his vow in repect to the assassin of his father I\" Edith uttered a cry of joy. \" Ob, aunt !\u2014 dear, dear aunt I\u2014 can all that be really true?\" \" It is true, my child, and a happy truth it is.\" Edith began to cry. \" Ah, my loved one ! those are happy tears, so I do not mind you shedding them.\" A long consultation then ensued between Lady Castleneau and Edith, during which tbe latter explained why it was that she had, without the knowledge of her dear aunt, gone abroad at night; and she begged that, in consideration of all the motives of that action, Lady Castleneau would forgive her for the gentle and well-intentioned deceit. Indeed, he did more than chuckle, for he uttered one of his hideous laughs, which was so much more demoniac and hideous even than usual, that despite his injunctions to the contrary, and his threats if he were disobeyed, several of his men thrnst their heads out of various hiding-places, to see what had happened. And iu the meantime the carriage rapidly ap proached Severndroog Castle. Edith sat by the side of her aunt, with both her hands clasped in those of that atfectionate relative and second mother, as she might truly be called. It was Edith, not Lady Castleneau, who had brought up tbe name of John Tarleton, who was far better known to the old gentlewoman than to EJith. Edith's aunt was only too well disposed, now that, as she fondly hoped all would be wtU again, to forget and forgive everything. \" My dear Edith,\" she said, \" we will look upon all the past now as so thoroughly past, that we will never let it cross our minds again. There is one thing, however, that we wiU do at once.\" \"My dear child,\" said the more than ordinarily reflective and sensible lady \u2014 \" my dear chUd, lay it down, as a rule, never, for the future, let what may appear to be tha consequences, have a secret from your husband.\""], [206, "200 ODITH HERON. Lady Castleneau began to be a little suspioio-n that they were too late. But she would not encourage the alarm she saw gathering on the face of Edith. \" Well, my dear,\" she said, \" suppose the worst and that Felix is not here, it will be but a little delay ; and I daresay we shaU soon be able to find out where he is.\" \" I will not, indeed, aunt ! Bat oh, it was so wicked of me to doubt him !\" \" No, my child, not wicked, but indiscreet, and not very wise ; for you wUl find that the vow of vengeance he took against the hand that took his father's life would soon be forgotten and retracted, when he should see that part of the punishment would fall on your heart !\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes ! \u2014 I see all that now, aunt I\" \" Then we wiU say no more about it ; nor should I now, but that you mistrust your brother John, who I know is past all redemption and reclama tion. But he will trouble you no more.\" \" Do you think he wUl not ?\" \" I am sure of it So soon as he finds all is known to your husband, his fears, of which, from a child, he always had a good stock, wUl keep him from ever coming in your way again.\" Edith felt a gathering weight lifted from her heart at this assurance from her aunt; for she was still afraid that ber brother would come into collision with Felix Heron in some way, and that, on the moment, the memory only of his dying father might rise up before him, Heron. And so they reached the foot of Shooter's HUl. \" I wUl hope so.\" Edith now made her way into the hall oi the castle, and, raising ber voice, she called aloud, \" Felix\u2014 Felix\u2014 Felix I It is I, your own Edith, who calls to you ! Felix \u2014 Felix\u2014 Felix !\" A faint cry, that, to the ears of Edith, sounded like the word \"Here!\" came from some upper portion of the castle; and so possessed was she with the hope of hearing the voice of Felix Heron, that the sound seemed to have the cadences of his tones in it. \" Follow, aunt \u2014 follow ! He's here indeed, and perhaps iU or wounded 1\" Edith ran up the staircase, as closely followed by Lady Castleneau as she could find strength to do so. There was the long corridor of which we have already had occasion to make mention, and opening from it was a room, the door of which stood invitingly half closed only. Some sound, between a sigh and a moan, came from the room. The horses, which had only indulged in a very mild trot over the heath, now subsided at once into the most slow and staid of walks. Old Anthony turned round and spoke to his mistress, through the front window. \" If you please, my lady, it wUl be just as well to get out, and walk up the hill. It's a steep one, and the horses look as if they did not Uke it.\" Lady Castleneau had a great partiality for animals of all kinds and descriptions, and was always ready to put up with any inconvenience herself, rather than they should suffer in the least. Edith did not hesitate a moment Her imagi nation was in a state of excitement that prevented her from having any caution in respect to her movements; and, closely followed by Lady Castle neau, who was carried away by Edith's oxample and impulse, she entered the room. It was partially darkened. The door closed with a loud noise. A brutal laugh rang through the room, and, drawing a chair, which he placed with its back to the door, down sat Jonathan Wild, and glared upon his prisoners. \"Nabbed!\" he yelled. Edith uttered a scream of terror. This suggestion, therefore, from old Anthony was taken in perfect good part, and Lady CasUe neau and Edith alighted. \" Here is a gate,\" said Edith, \" and it appears to lead into the grounds of the castle, aunt\" \" Yes, my dear ; but I see, further on, a regular drive to the front of the old place : so let us go on.\" Lady Castleneau turned pale first, and then her face flushed with indignation. \" Nabbed !\" yeUed Wild again. \" Ha, ha !\" The loud, terrible laugh subsided in that odd way which Jonathan must have made a complete study of doing, or he could never have accom plished it Edith shrank back, as she would have shrunk back from some venomous reptile. \"Come, come, my Lady Countess that was,\" said Wild, \" bnt that will be no longer ; I fancy that there is tome sort of fascination in my style ol beauty, or you and I would never meet so often.\" Lady Castleneau took Edith by the hand. \" Come, my '.ear,\" she said. \" In my opinion, and I feel quite sure it is yours likewise, the very air that this man breathes is a pollution. Jonathan Wild, get out of my way, I command you ! \" Wild was so astonished at the carriage of old Lady Castleneau, that he haU cleared away from the door impulsively. But it was only for the instant that the higher nature and the nobility of carriage triumphed over him. He made a mock bow as he said, \" Oh, of course, my Lady Castlenean, I am your most obe dient humble servant to command ; but these heroics will not al ways do, I can assure you ; and on the present occasion they are singularly ont of place- You are my prisoner !\" \" Your prisoner ?\" \" Yes; and you, too. Lady Elith!\" \"Felix-oh, Felix!\" They did go on, and the carriage came slowly after them to the principal gates ; and then old Anthony permitted them to get in again, and Edith and her aunt were driven into the hands of the greatest enemy they had ever had. Jonathan Wild had seen them both now, and he chuckled and rubbed his hands with delight CHAPTER LXXIII. JONATHAN WILD TAKES HIS PRISONERS TO LON- DON, AND FINDS HIP ESTABLISHMENT KATHER FULL. \" Alas, aunt,\" said Editn. \" I see no one !\" \u2022' Perhaps we shall presently, my dear.\" \" No, no ! I begin to feel assured that Felix is not here !\" \" Why eo, my child?\" \" Because at the forest we always had scouts and sentinels, and no one could have got so far as this towards a house of Felix Heron's, unquestioned.\" Old Anthony had now got off the coach-box to open the door of the vehicle, and he looked about for some bell or knocker to announce the presence of the surely welcome visitors."], [207, "rDirii hcp.un. 201 \"Oh,\" said Wild, quietly, \"if you waut Captain Felix Heron, you had better go with me to town, without any words about it, for I have him in my custody.\" WUd thought this would be a good statement to overcome any resistance Edith might make , notwithstanding he was prepared by force to compel her to come to London. Too well he knew that there was no help for tho^e whom he had made his captives on that oc casion, and over whom he had made np his mind to assume the sovereignty of a gaoler. Lady Castleneau cried out once again, \" Help !\" The echo of her own voice among the trees and about the hill, on which stood the old castle, was the only sound that arose to that casement in reply to her. \"No,\" said Edith; \"the mere fact that you make the statement, stamps it as an untruth.\" \" JVght, Edith,\" said Lady Castleneau ; \" and as then- may be some man in this place, as weU as the fiend who now obstructs our way, I will call to him for help.\" As she spoke, Lady Castleneau dashed aside the long cloth curtain that shaded and darkened th window ; and flinging it open, she cried aloud \"Help! help! help!\" WUd orossed his arms on his chest, and Then she saw that, for the present at all events, the position in which she and Edith stood was helpless. She turned to Edith, and held both her hands as she said, \" Mv dear, we are like traveUers who have unawares srxofled into the den of somo mon ster I We cannot perhaps help ourselves just at present, but we will not despair 1\" Edith trembled excessively, but she strove to command her feelings, and to speak to her aunt l.ugbed.

But they had both caugmt the halt- uttered sen tence ; and Edith, clasping ber hands, cried ont, \" You bear him, aunt\u2014you hear him ! Felix has escaped him, and there are a thousand resoues in the word 1\" Wild bit his lips with anger ; and raising the whistle to his lips, he blew u. ea i iii call. It was replied to by.one of his men below, and then WUd shouted from the window, \" Securer that old fool who is driving the ct__i, that you will find down below!\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" \" Now, ladieS,\" added Wild, \" you may as well take things easy, as I mean to do I I am qnit^ a ladies' man when I am let alone ; but cross me, and I am as wild by nature as I am by nnuse ! You cannot escape me ; and rather than you should do so, I will handcuff you both to one of my bull-dogs!\" Neither Edith nor Lady Castleneau made any reply to this speech. \" Come,\" added Wild, \" it is my turn to com mand now I Follow me I\" They felt how futile it would be to attempt to contradict, or practically oppose, that man ; and, hand in hand, they foUowed him from the room. In the corridor without, Wild was met by one of his men, who, with an eagerness that caused Jonathan to utter some fearful maledictions on his head, cried out, \" If yon please, Mr. Wild, we cannot find the man who drove the coach, but the two horses are there I\" \" Wretch ! Idiot I\" Lady Castleneau pressed the hand of Blith, as she whispered to her, \" Anthony has escaped !\" \" Yes, dear aunt, there is hope now !\" \" Abundant \u2014 abundant !\" \" Search the whole place for him P'-yelled Wild. \" Leave not a hole or oorner jralooked into I Twenty guineas for him, alive-or dead ! \u2014 aUye or dead I\" No doubt the search that ensued for old An- But it was lost upon the old lady, who looked as stern and as defiant as before. Edith was not made of s_cb courageous ma- terial as her aunt ; but, still, she had a portion of the true spirit and courage which formed so large an ingredient in the composition of her aunt, and it was sufficient to uphold her even in the present calamitous state of things. \" Come, ladies,\" said Wild, with a mock bow, \u2014 \"come, ladies. Our stay is no longer of any avail ; and we wUl, Uyou please, proceed to town.' \" We are your prisoners,\" said Lady Castleneau ; ': and as you have yonr .gang of ruffians about you, it is reasonably to be anpposed that they are strong enough to enforce your orders as re- gards two women. Therefore, ve will not create tbe scandal of a contest. Gome, Edith ! for tbe present, we must obey this mau- Perhaps the time may soon come when the tables wiU be \u25a0 turned.\" Lady Castleneau then placing the arm of Edith beneath her own, -walked down the staircase to the lower part of the castle, with all the dignity of a princess in her own palace. It was evident taat Jonathan Wild very much admired ihe spirit shown by_Xady Castleneau; but that admiration was a thing quite apart from all .his resolves, and did not in the least hinder him from c*rrymg them out. \"Here, vou.'Moulds ?\";ho cried. \"Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Get on that ooacb-box. Yon wUl play .coach- man for this occasion.\"\" \"Yes, tsir.\" Moulds. got up into Anthonyi.vacantseat ot. the coach-box ; and then Jonathan himself, wi;l__. an affectation of great, politeness, opened the doj~ of the carriage for. Lady Gastlaneaifcaiid Edith. They both got in. They felt that not only had __hey no alternative but to do so, bnt that there were, batter chances in London for escape from the dutches of Jonathan Wild than there could be in that seclnded situa tion, en Shooter's HiU. Jonathan then closed the coach door, and it waa a wonderful relief to them both that he did no. propose to ride with them. At, least, at thot time he showed no such inten tion, although before they reached London they had some of his company. WUd placed one of his men on guard at the coach, and then he took aside a fellow, whom he might be said to have recently promoted to his confidence, and spoke to him in a low tone. \" Nixey, I don't think you are a man to stand upon trities, are you?\" \" Not a bit, Mr. Wild!\" growled Nixey, who, if that were at all possible, was a more unscrupulous ruffian than Jonathan Wild himself. thony was active enough, but it proved totally in effectual He was nowhere to be seen, and not the slightest trace of how he had escaped from the castle could be discovered.\" Wild was furious. In the escape of old Anthony, he saw the pos sible frustration of all his plans \u2014 those plans which he had suddenly founded upon the acci dental capture of Edith and of Lady Castle neau \" Very well, Nixey. There is an old feUow, a coachman and servant, who drove this carriage down here. I am confident he is lurking some where about this place, and what I want to do is to have you and Ned the Cadger to Ue in wait for him.\" He burst into a complete torrent of abuse and invective, which he only ceased upon Lady Castleneau saying to him, \" If the notorious Jona than WUd forgets that even he has some slight pretensions to be called a man, he should never forget the presence of ladies.\" Wild looked at her with astonishment. \"All right I\" \" And, Nixey !\" * Yes, Mr. Wild !\" \" I don't want the old fool. My little establish ment in Newgate Street is getting uncommon! v full already. So, you comprehend, I don't want him ?\" \" WeU,\" be said, \" if I had not been a man, and that man Jonathan WUd, 1 should have chosen to be Lady Castleneau.\" This was, certainly, the nearest approach to a compliment which the great and unscrupulous thief-taker had ever paid to any one in all his life. \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" But at the same time, you see, he is danger: \u25a0;;.-. and must be made safe.\""], [209, "203 EDITH HERON. \" On, I see !\" \" Of course you do, Nixey !\" \" I'll just give him a topper, Mr. Wild ; and if that don't do the business, I have my knife. A slit of the windwipe, and he won't blob anything.\" \" You are a capital fellow, Nixey ! I prefer the dab on the head to the knife business. It is always better; because, when the body is found, U it should be, there are so many suppositions as to how a man might come by a crack of the skull. By the bye, it wUl be a good plan, if you do get bold of him, to dispose of him down the old gravel pit on the heath.\" \" All's right 1\" \" Don't fail me, and I wiU not forget it\" Nixey nodded. The fate of old Anthony was certainly quite de cided if this ruffian should happen to come across him about the castle. liked the little arrangement, however fUttt.rins may have been the manner iu which it was carried out In imagination, he was on the old heath, galloping along by the side of Edith, and lookioe: for such adventures as might choose to present themselves to him. And now to be cooped up in lhat old mansion in Bloomsbury Fields, was not at all what ha would have desired. Tom sat in the hall, and got decidedly fidgetty. He paced it to and fro, and wondered what was taking place at tho castle on Shooter's HiU. \" Bother it all !\" exclaimed Tom ; \" why did Lady Castleneau take it into her head to keep me here, when any other man, who might not nave cared for the road, wonld have done quite as well tn look after the old house ?\" Tom was in the midst of these cogitations when the bell at the old iron gates that divided thi* court-yard from the road gave forth a faint peal. Was it Lady Castleneau and Edith who had re turned so soon, or was it Felix Heron ? Tom Ripon looked through the side-lights of the door as he stood in the hall, and he sa w that it was unquestionably a female form that was at the fron gates. A second glance sufficed to identify that form to Tom. There was a grim smile of satisfaction upon the face of Jonathan Wild now, as he adopted the mode of going to town which he liked best of all. That was not iu the coach, or on the box of it, or behind it, but on the roof. Seated there, he not only, as he said, had a fine _iry situation, but he commanded a good view all around him. H . could give orders to his man, and he c mid lit the man on the head who acted as coachman, :. hde at the. same time any attempt on the part of his prisoner to escape would bo certain to meet his observation. He felt certain that it could be none other than his mother, Mrs. Mortification Ripon, or as ho choicely and elegantly named her, \" The old gal.\" \" What the deuce,\" said Tom, to himself, \" does she want here, I wonder ?\" Tom then saw that a young maid-of-all-work, that was in the service of Lady Castleneau, had gone to epen the gates ; and he saw that a parley was taking place between his mother and the young girl, aud that the latter shook her head a number of times. Wild then blew a rallying call on his whistle, and all his party, with the exception of Nixey and Ned the Cadger, left the castle. \"London \u2014 and look sharp absut it!\" cried Wild. Off set the cavalcade at a good pace across the heath, and piobably never within their memory had the fat and rather lazy horses of Lady Castle neau's carriage had to bestir themselves to such quickness of locomotion. \" Courage, Edith, courage !\" whispered Lady Castleneau, as she kissed the fair brow of her dar ling niece ; \" courage, dear one, and be assured that all will yet be weU !\" Now Tom Ripon was exceedingly anxious to know on what errand his mother had come to Castleneau House ; so, for fear she should go away without his seeing her, he called from the hall to the lower region of the house, where he heard Martha bustling about, \" Martha ! \u2014 Martha, my dear !\" \" What is it ?\" \" There's a female at the gate. I ought to see her ; for it's of consequence, or may be, to Edith.\" \" Goodness, yes, Mr. Tom !\" \" G\u00bbt her into the house. Say a gentleman wants to speak to her in the breakfast-room.\" \" A gentleman ! What gentleman ?\" \" Why, I am the gentleman, to be sure ! Who else do you think, eh ?\" \" Bless ns !\" was Martha's rejoinder, but she went to the gates just as Mrs. Ripon was about to depart, on the assurance of the maid-of-aU-work that Lady Castleneau was not at home. The message, however, that Tom had sent had all its effect, and Mrs. Ripon crossed the court yard and entered the house- Tom had flung himself into a large Ubrary chair in the breakfast-room, and with his legs over one arm of it, there he sat, with au air of ineffable con ceit and consequence upon his face. The room was darkened and shadowed by the luxuriant vegetation of the tall trees in the ancient garden, which Lady Castleneau would not have cut, and lopped, and spoiled to please any gardener ; and, moreover, there were creeping and climbing plants, which, at their own free will, and in their own natural and graceful manner, made their way up to the tops of the windows, an/! CHAPTER LXXrV. TOM RIPON HAS AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER. To his great discomfort, Tom Ripon had been left. at Castleneau House, when Edith and his aunt started ou the expedition in search of Felix Heron to the castle on Shooter's HUl. To be sure, what Lady Castleneau said to him on the occasion ought to have reconcUed him to tbe little arrangement. \" Tom,\" she said, \" I take, as you see, old Anthony with me ; and as I do not like to have my hou.-e entirely unprotected, I hope you wiU stay and look after it till I come back \" Tom Ripon would fain have accompanied them, but since it was not to be, he made the best of what he called a bad affair. \" Well, marm, as you say some man ought to be In the house \u2014 hem \u2014 I'll stay.\" If Lady Castleneau smiled at aU at Tom Ripon's words, she took good care not to let him see that she did so, and so Tom was practically left in charge of Caftleceai House- It cannot be said, however, that Tom Bipon"], [210, "204 EDITH HERON. A man is not to be insulted in this way, though his name may be Ripon !\" \" You little monster I So this is the way yon treat your poor mother \u2014 who was always boximi your ears and thrashing you within an inch ot your life, and yet did not do it half enough \u2014 uow that she has fallen into misfortune! Oh, dear! \u2014 oh, dear ! as the song says \u2014 then sent down long, graceful pendants, loaded with fair blossoms. And ali these made the air of that breakfast room at old Castleneau House have that cool, green look about it whioh was necessarUy grateful to the eyes. But to Mrs. Ripon, coming out of the open white light of the day, the place was rather dark. She did not see Tom weU. With a couple of profound curtssys at the door, Mrs. Ripen greeted the supposed gentleman who wanted to see her. Tom saw the advantage\u2014 for he supposed it such \u2014 that he had over his mother, and he made up hit mind to keep it. \" ' Take it for all in all, I do consider It's a very shocking thing to be a widderf \" Tom whistled. \"Oh ! \u2014 oh ! \u2014 oh !\" continued Mrs. Ripon ; \" lim it come to this? Is this the end? Is this tha finish ? Is this the \u2014 the cat \u2014 oat \u2014 cat \" \"Cat!\u2014 what cat?\" \" Astrophe, I mean.\" \" Oh, bother ! You don't mean to say yon reaUy knew me, old 'un, do you ?\" \" To be sure, I did !\" screamed Mrs Ripon. \" You a gentleman and a magistrate! Poof! \u2014 poof! You can't impose upon mel You might as well have tried, while I was in business, to bring me a plated candlestick, and say it was silver.\" A large silk handkerchief, belonging to Lady Castleneau, was on the edge of a couch close at hand, so that he could j ust reach it Tom did reach it, and flung it over his head and face, but so that he could see his mother very well notwithstanding. \" Ah, well, my good woman,\" said Tom in a feigned voice, \" I think your name is, or used to was to be, Ripon or Pipon, or something like that\" \" Well, well ! don't make a row.\" \" Row, indeed, you little unnatural villain ! What do you do here, eh ? \u2014 a sitivation, is it, eh ? Clean the boots and shoes, and knives and forks, eh ?

You don't mean it I I came to see her, to this very house as never was, in consequence of this.\" \" Yes, your worship,\" said Mrs. Ripon, \" it were.\" \" Oh ! very good.

To be sure, she might giv* about half the money to be quite certain he wn hanged ; but you don't know enough of all tha affairs that I and other men have been engaged in with Lord Warringdale, to be aware \u00bb'm i right-down bad 'un he Is !\" \" Yes !\" suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Ripon, mak ing a dash forward, and snatching the handker chief from Tom's head, and transferring it to her pocket at the same moment, \u2014 \"aud here he is! \u2022Oh, you abominable little wretch 1* \" HiUoa!\" cried Tom, \" what do you mean?"], [211, "205 EDITH HERON. \" Graoious 'evens I\" We must, however, now leave Mrs. Ripen tn fight her own battles with Jonathan, while we follow Tom on an expedition which his impatience made him at length determine npon undertaking. The morning was fading rapidly away, and to Tom's great consternation neither Edith nor Felix Heron made an appearance at Castleneau House. \" Yes ; you may weU say that, old gal ; but how came you by this paper?\" \" Oh, Tom, yonr poor mother has been sadly put about ; and so, at last, I was forced, in a man ner of speaking, to go and be a sort of a house keeper to Jonathan WUd.\" \" Oh, indeed !\" \"Yes, Tom, you may well pity your poor mother, who has become a lone widow for the ninth time I\" Over and over again Tom calculated the time that it ought to have taken so: the old horses that drew Lady Castleneau's coach to get to Blackheath and back again ; and when he felt convinced that time had passed twice over, Tom Ripon's impatience got the better of every other consideration. He went to th? stable at once, and saddling the horse which he now called his own, since Edith had given it to him, he rede out into the court yard. \" Martha ! Martha !\" he cried ; \" say to\" Lady Castleneau, if I should happen to miss her on the road, that I have gone to Shooter's Hill.\" So saying, Tom, without waiting for a word of reply, which he was afraid might assume the shape, of remonstrance, galloped away. He did not think it at all likely that he could meet the carriage of Lady Castleneau, if it were on its route to London ; and as he rode fast, he was soon on the highway, with Greenwich not many miles ahead of him. Less than an hour sufficed to bring Tom to the confines of the heath. Tom laughed. \"What has become of Mortification?\" he asked. \" Do yon mean to say you have got rid of him ?\" \" Mr. WUd says he is no more.\" \" True,\" added Tom \u2014 \" true, so far as Wild is concerned ! He may think so, but I don't You may depend upon it that, as the Psalmist says, he will come back again, like a bad penny !\" \" Yon don't mean it, Tom ! He was a fine man !\" \" What ! that animated lamp- post a fine man ! Well, there's no accounting for tastes ; I wiU say that ! However, mother, I will give this paper to Lady Castleneau ; and as to the reward \" \" Yes ! \u2014 oh, yes, Tom ! \u2014 the reward ?\" \" Why, that you must get from Lord Warring dale himseU, for you won't get it here !\" \" Oh, Tom, Tom !\" \" What's the matter now ?\" \" I oan't \u2014 I can't ! \u2014 indeed, I can't go back to Wild's house ! I won't, and I can't ! It's dull, there's Tats, and the kitchen as full as full can be of black beetles ! I can't indeed, Tom ! Your poor mother wUl stay with you, Tom, and be a real mother to you ! I suppose you find this a rather comfortable house, don't you ?\" Tom got up \" Old gal !\" \"WeU, Tom?\" \" In about half an hour there will be some con stables here to look after the honse, and one of them will be named Jukes.\" Then he paused, and looked about him. Not a soul was to be seen, with the exception of a man who was minding some sheep, or appeared to be minding them. This man had a terrible red beard, and a head of hair of the most scrubby pattern, of the same colour ; but Tom thought some information might possibly be got from him ; so, riding np to him, he said, \" Well, my man, have you been long npon the heath to-day ?\" \" Long enough to know you again !\" replied the man. \" If you stir hand or foot, you are dead!\" \"Jukes! Jukes! You don't mean that horrid wretch, who, when I kept a shop merely for tbe purchase and sale of lost and found property, used to come troubling me about some silver knives and forks that he would have it were stolen by some body, and bought by me, as if a poor widow could knew what she bought?\" * The very man !\" \" Then I'm off !\" As he spoke, thi. man, whose voice Tom now recognised as the pretended hedgehog hunter. and then smuggler, presented a pistol full at his head. Tom was staggered at the moment, and his presence of mind seemed to be abont to forsake him ; but that was only for a moment \"What do you mean by knowing me, and threatening my life ?\" \" You wUl soon find that out ! I don't know yet by what devilry you got out of the caves at the bottom of the gravel-pit, and fonnd your horse, and rode away ; but you see me now in a different disguise \u2014 I am a shepherd on the heath, and yon wUl never look upon the Ught of another day !\" Tom felt despairing. He knew well that one of the pistols in the saddle of the horse he rode was loaded, and one only : which one that was, now, he had not the least idea. \" Stop a moment, mother. You ma; possibly get the thousand pounds yet\" \" How, Tom ? How ?\" \"By continuing to be the housekeeper of Jonathan Wild ; but by, at the same time, letting me know aU that goes on in his crib.\" \"IwUl\u2014 IwUl!\" \"All's right, old gal! Now you be off; but remember, it is not Lord Warringdale that we feel an interest in.\" CHAPTER LXXV. If he were to commence an examination, to find out nothing would be easier than for the smuggler of the heath\u2014 if that were, after all, his real voca tion \u2014 to shoot him dead upon the spot. It did not appear that there was any help at hand, either to save him or to avenge him. Tom looked all round npon the heath, and could see no one. TOM EIPON MEETS WITH A STARTLING ADVEN TURE ON BLACKHEATH. Mrs. Ripon left Castleneau House, and at the top of her speed made her way towards Jonathan Wild's residence. She hoped that her temporary absence wonld be concealed from him ; bnt she had no notion of tbe artful genius she had to deal with. He and that man appeared to occupy the wide expanse as completely to themselves as thougt"], [212, "206 EDITH HERON. from whioh he had just the moment before dis mounted, and eagerly sought for the one pistol, out of the pair in the holsters, which he knew was still loaded. As was ts be expected, he got hold of the empty one first, but he was as quick as thought in pro \u2022 curing the other; and then, just as with his left hand the wonnded smuggler raised his fallen pistol, Tom too was armed with a simUar weapon. \" Blaze away !\" shouted Tom Ripon ; and as he spoke he pulled the trigger. _ The smuggler fired likewise. \" All's fair !\" said Tom. \" Shot for shot you can't complain of.\" Something had come Uke a streak of Ughtning so closely past the cheek of Tom Ripon, tbat the skin was to Ihe smallest possible extent actually ploughed np. That was the bullet from the pistol of the smuggler. they had been the only snrvivors of some wreck, who had reached the strand of some uninhabited island. The man saw, with a grim smile, the state of perplexity to which Tom Ripon was evidently re duced. But he stUl kept the pistol on a level with Tom's head, as he said, \" Dismount! You have pistols in the holster of that saddle ! Dismount, I say, at once !\" \" Needs must,\" said Tom, \" when a certain person drives !\" He got off the horse. \" Now, my lad,\" said the man, \" I wiU tell you what will be your little future career and fate !\" \"Much obliged!\" \" Oh, don't mention it ! Yon wUl be kept a close prisoner in one of the vaults down below here, untU you choose to join us, and take such an oath that you dare not break, to be true ; and then you will be taken on board our little vessel, which is now at Sheerness, and which just wants a lively lad like you, aud you wiU never be per mitted to leave her 1\" Bnt Tom's aim had been better still. With a yeU, the man of the red beard and the many disguises roUed over on to his back, and so kept rolling over and over, and tearing up band fuls of tbe short, crisp grass as he went, until he reached the verge of the old gravel pit, when over he went, and disappeared from Tom's sight in stantly. \" Good-bye !\" said Tom. There came one more strange, unearthly sort of cry from the bottom of the old gravel-pit, and Tom hoped it was the last of the treacherous smuggler, for whose fate it would have indeed been an excess of sentiment to feel anything in the shape of pity. \" Thank you !\" \" In the meantime, what have you got in your pockets ?\" \" Only a few guineas I\" \" Only! Well, hand them out \u2014 hand them out at once, and bring them to me, and be quick about it!\" Tom dived his hand into his pocket, and took out two guineas, one of which he dropped on the heath. \" Pick that up !\" cried the man. \" You are clumsy and stupid !\" \" I'm a litUe ont of sorts, if you please !\" said Tom. But Tom Ripon had curiosity, if he had little commiseration, as regarded the fate of the man whom he had been certainly obliged to kUl in self-defence. \"What about?\" \" Why, I don't Uke that pistol being always pointed at me !\" \" Don't yon ? WeU, you see, my lad, that is a little point of difference between us! I think it necessary; so pick up the guinea, and bring it here, without more ado about it!\" \" Yes !\" said Tom. \" I always does one thing when I can't help it!\" \"What is that?\" Taking, therefore, bis horse by the bridle, he led it to the brink of the gravel-pit, and then looked down. Nothing was to be seen but the tangled briara and furze-bushes with which the place was libe rally supplied \" Well,\" said Tom, \" that's about over, I fancy. I wonder now what I had better do next ?\" Tom stood by his horse in a state of doubt and uncertainty, and as he did so he looked towards the old castle on Shooter's Hill. \" I gives in!\" \" That is wise ! You are not such a fool as Tom eyes were young and keen, and he could see for any long distance you like to mentiou, with a tolerable certainty of not making any mistakes of one object for another. . And now, as he looked towards Shooter's HUl and the castle, and the thick luxuriant plantation around it, he felt certain that among the trees and the bushes he saw a something rather unusual. It looked like a flag. But Tom shaded his eyes from the morning light, and, so to speak, concentrated his gaz 3 until he felt convinced it was not a flag, but a coloured handkerchief, held up as high as possible on the end of a stick. you look !\" \" Thank you! I am always sorry when I can't return a compliment ! But aU I can do, I wiU do!\" Tom had not been in one quarter the trepida tion he had assumed; and his dropping the guinea had been an act done on purpose. The fact was, that Tom Ripon had both seen and felt, lying close to his feet, an ugly, jagged shaped piece of flint-stone ; and, thanks to the sort of street education he had had in London, Tom was suoh an adept at stone-casting as could very rarely be met with. He stooped, apparently for the guinea; but he picked np the piece of flint It whizzed through the air en the instant. There came a yell of pain from the smuggler, and the pistol fell from his hand to the grass. That hand was more nerveless now than an Tom then saw further that that stick was long and flexible, and that something was streaming from it in the morning air, which only puzzled him for a few passing moments. Then Tom nodded, as he said, \" I know what that is now. Some one is holding up a long coach whip, with a handkerchief at the end of it Uke a flag.\" infant's, for the jagged piece of flint had hit it on the back with a force that not only produced the most excruciating pain, as Tom knew right well it would, but at once deprived it of aU power of motion. Who could that some one be ? That was the question. \" AU right !\" said Tom. \" No, I mean all wrong Tom Bipon then made a rush towards the horse"], [213, "EDITH HfiP.ON- 207 It's only all right that I can gness something is atui-a ; but the something amisB is aU wrong.\" Tom was right enough ; but he did uot know how, with any safety, to make further observations, for the daylight lay strong and f nU upon the heath, the hUl, and the castle. To approach the latter with the sUghtest chance of escaping observation, provided any watch at all were kept was an impossibility- And yet Tom Ripon felt that approach he must, if he would do any good. There were two ways of proceeding in the* mat ter, and Tom for a few minutes was undecided which would be the best Ducking sometimes under the thick branches of brumbies that strove to bar his way, and some times getting his foot on one, and so bending it down tUl its powerful offensive spikes stuck in the soft soil, ho made good speed towards the spot from whence projected the coach-whip and the extemporised flag. In about ten minutes Tom had reached the spot and there, to his surprise, he saw, tied by a piece of cord to the stem of a young tree, the sUver monnted whip, which he knew at a glance be longed to Anthony, when he went out as coaoh man to the lumbering old carriage of his mistress, Lady Castleneau. At the end <*f the whip, just where the thong began, was fastened a red silk handkerchief. But what did it mean ? He might try to creep towards Shooter's Hill, something like an Indian scout, or he might gallop up to it boldly, like one who scared no danger. \"Which shall it be?\" said Tom to himseU. \"Which wUl be the best way now, I wonder?\" As he spoke, his eyes fell on the sheep which the smuggler had been pretending to take care of on the common. They had slowly strayed in the direction of where he, Tom, was, as they nibbled away at the herbage of the heath. \" Suppose, now,\" thought Tom, w I play the part of shepherd, and so get nearer and nearer to the castle\" And where was Anthony ? Where, too, where the horses? where the car riage? where Lady Castleneau?\u2014 and last, al though foremost of all in Tom's anxieties and estimations, where was the Lady Edith? \"Hilloa!\" 6aid Tom, \" what does all this mean?\" Hardly had the words escaped him, than some thing struck him on the top of the bead, and b i heard a half stifled voice cry, \" Whist I whist Don't! don't! It's me \u2014 me \u2014 Anthony 1\" \"Where? Oh, where?\" \" Up the tree I\" \"Lor'!\" Fortune seemed to acquiesce in this plan ; for no sooner had Tom Ripon formed it, than he saw, lying close to the edge, or brink, of the gravel-pit, the country labourer's-looking hat, which the smuggler had worn as part of his disguise- When Tom got that hat on he was tolerably well made np for a shepherd boy. To be sure, the horse was a Uttle difficulty; but it was no uncommon thing to see a horse grazing on the old heath. So Tom fonnd a piece of wood, and staked it firmly into the earth, and tied the end of the bridle to it, having nnbuckled it so that it served the purpose of a long leather rope. The horse conld move about very well in suffi cient space to enable him to get a pretty good feed off the short, sweet grass- Tom took command of the sheep, and began slowly to drive them in au obUque direction to wards Shooter's HUL Tom looked abont him, and it was still some fe w seconds before he could see the ancient serving man, quite hidden and embedded amid the foliage of a young eye -more tree, whose massive leaves actea as a capital screen and concealment. But, to the further surprise of Tom, old Anthony began to pull, as he thought, the tree to pieces. Bongh after bough of the young sycamore was flung to the earth among the nut- bushes, the briars, and the rich undergrowth of aU kinds and descriptions that filled that plantation. And as Anthony continued this process, he be came more and more visible, until Tom began to wonder how tho young tree had ever effectually concealed him at all. StiU he kept every now and then looking at the mysterious Uttle flag among the trees, aud he saw that it kept its place ; and the nearer he got to Shooter's HiU, of course the more plainly he saw it, and the more certain he was that his first judgment in regard to it was a correct one. It undoubtedly was a handkerchief on the end of a coach-whip. Without, then, having the least alarm, or being challenged, or stopped in any way, Tom, with his sheep, got so close to the thick plantation round the castle, that he was tolerably well concealed. But tbe secret of the Uttle transaction soon became evident. Tbe tree was not sufficient, either in size or density of foliage, to conceal any one ; so, before ascending it, Anthony had provided himself with a number of boughs from the other sapUngs about the spat, aud with those he had covered himseU up so completely, that not a vestige of the rather bright livery he wore was visible. \" Why,\" said Tom, \" what has happened, that you have got into the middle of a tree in that way ?\" \" Everything has happened,\" said old Anthony. \" Murder, for all I know, has happened!\" \" Murder!\" \" Yes, Mr. Thomas \u2014 yes!\" Tom Ripon was rather flattered to be called \" Mr. Thomas,\" bnt when Anthony spoke again, that pleasant effect wore off. \" But why \u2014 oh, why,\" added Anthony, \u2014 \" why do I speak to a child of such things, when it is not possible he can be of any assistance P\" \" Oh, stuff ! \u2014 who do you call a ehild ? Come, conie, old Truepenny ! just let me know what has happened, and I wiU see what can be done.\" \" Oh, dear !\u2014 oh dear 1\" Old Anthony sat down among the bonghs and tranches of the sycamore saplings, and wrung his CHAPTER LXSVI. TOM RIPON AND OLD ANTHONY ENCOUNTER JONATHAN WTLDS BULL-DOGS AT SHOOTERS HILL. Then Tom Ripon abandoned the sheep. They were no longer of any use to him ; and taking one last good look at the handkerchief at tbe end of tbe whip, to make sure of his right direction, he plunged among the luxuriant thickets and under wood which surrounded the castle. Tom was small and active, and he made his way weU. hands in despair."], [214, "208 EDITH 111'KOX. 1 \" That's not the way to do any good!\" remon strated Tom Ripon. * TeU me at once \u2014 is Edith safe?\" presenting one of his pistols at the other of Jona than's bull- dogs, he cried out, \" Forward! For ward now, my men, and we shall have them aU !\" The bull-dog took a rapid glance above him, and then seeing that no men were about to advance, he shonted at the top of his voice, \" 60 yon will have it, eh?\" At the same moment he fired at Tom Kipon. The shot might have been fatal, and in that little wood surrounding the castle on Shooter's HUl, the mortal career of Tom Ripon might have come to an end. \"No! no! no!\" \"And the old lady?\" \" Both taken prisoners by Jonathan WUd him self.\" Tom gave a long whistle. \" Ob, that's it, is it?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes I They went into the castle, and then I heard quite sufficient to convince me that something was wrong, so I stepped off the coach box and hid myself, to lee what I should do ; and I soon fonnd that if I had not done so, I, too, should have been a prisoner.\" \" Go on \u2014 go on, do I What did yon see ? TeU me all about it\" Bat it was not fated so to be. To the surprise of Tom, and no donbt much more to the surprise of the man himself, over he went backwards at the instant his finger wag on the trigger of the pistol. The bullet slew harmlessly in the air above the tree-top. \" I saw Jonathan Wild take away my mistress, Lady Castleneau, and poor, dear Edith, in the coach. He had quite a band of ruffians with him, and he has left some here behind him.\" But Jonathan WUd's bull-dog thought himself a dead man, for he was pulled backwards on to his back, and there held by some one, of whom he conld form no opinion or conjecture. Tom, however, saw that it was to old Anthony that he was indebted for this most efficient aid at the precise moment it was wanted. \"Has he?\" \" Oh, yes ; and it is for the purpose of shoot ing Felix Heron, if, by any accident, he should show himself at this place\" Tom now began to have a tolerable comprehen sion of what had taken place, and he was about to say something to old Anthony, when they both heard the crackling of branches, and the tread of a heavy footstep in the old plantation. \" Some one comes this way,\" said Tom. \" You hide behind the tree, aud I will get into it.\" Old Anthony crouched down as low as he could behind the tree : from the roots there grew so many young shoots, that it resembled a thick bush, and afforded him a very good concealment. Tom Ripon swung himself up into the tree at once. \" Bravo! bravo!\" cried Tom. The man, however, npon whose back Tom stood was rapidly recovering from the shock and the surprise of his fall, and it was pretty evident that a very serious struggle indeed, at very unequal odds, would soon take place nnless Tom Ripon could take some immediate steps to bring it to an end. \" Now, sir,\" cried Tom, to the man who might be said to be temporarily in his custody, \u2014 \" now, sir, if you are tired of your life, say so !\" Something cold was pushed against the fellow's ear with an uncomfortable sensation, and he knew it was the mnzzle of a pistol. A touch at the trigger of that pistol would pro bably, unless the incident of a miss-sire took place, scatter his brains among the underwood. There was not much, probably, to make that man's life charming, but still he had no desire to part with it ii he could help it. \" What do you want, and who are you ?\" he growled. \"Oh, that will do!\" said Tom Ripon. \"Now, Ue stUl, or you are a dead man !\" Tom Ripon now adopted a very ingenious plan, which may be said to be his own invention, of seeming this man from doing mischief. Tying a piece of sharp, strong cord ronnd the thumb of bis right hand, he passed the cord, then, over the fellow's neck, and then in a loop ronnd his throat, and, finally, tied it to the thumb of bis left hand. The footsteps rapidly approached, and then a gruff, surly voice cried out, \" Well ? What wild goose chase is this, now, I should like to know ?\" \" I tell you I am quite sure some one is here,\" replied another voice. \"I saw the trees and bushes moving hereabouts, in a way they could not do naturally.\" \" Oh, we'll get on, then !\" \" Keep your pistols ready !\" \" All's right\u2014 push on !\" Tom Ripon had no doubt in the world that these men were some of Jonathan Wild's myr midans. He had no doubt, likewise, that they wonld not scruple in the least to take his Use, and old Anthony's likewise, if they saw a good opportunity of so doing. The long brambles that intersected the planta tion in all directions so perplexed, and stung, and tore Jonathan WUd's two men, that they were not able to look np, and their whole attention was directed to trying to effect a passage onwards through the almost impervious underwood, so in termingled as it was with brambles. in this way they reached the tree in which Tom Ripon was but very inefficiently concealed. \"Hold!\" cried one of the men. \"We are now about the spot where I saw the trees moving.\" \" Are yon ?\" shouted Tom. \" How do you like that ?\" Tom then gave him a kick, as he said, \" I would advise you to keep as quiet as you can.\" The janissary of Jonathan Wild, who was held by old Anthony, had at first kicked and plunged a good deal, but be did not get away; and pro bably he did not make all the exertion so to do that was in his power, since Tom called out twice to Anthony, \" Don't be bothered with him ! Blow his brains out at once 1\" The whole transaction did not occupy many minutes in performing, and Tom dashed forward towards the second man, and had jnst secured him as he had the first, when, to his surprise, and rather to his consternation, he heard tbe sharp report of a pistol, and a couple of bullets came crashing through the trees. \" Answer ! answer ! and say who and what yon As he spoke, he let himself hurriedly down upon the head and shoulders of the man so unex pectedly that, combined with the actual force of the blow and the weight, he was overcome, and feU among the brambles. Tom, by a sort of scramble, succeeded in stand i ~rg upon this man's back as he lay prostrate, and"], [215, "EDITH HERON. 209 are, or your lives may pay the penalty of sUence !\" cried a loud voice. \" Thank heaven !\" \" Tom Eipon !\" exolaimed Heron,! in surprise. , ' Do I, indeed, behold you once again ?\" \" Oh, yes, Captain ; and aU aUve and kicking as the saying it ; and here is old Anthony, too' You know him well enough, Captain?\" \" Lady Caetleneau's servant ?

Hark, you, fellows ! Are you alone here ?\" The men looked dogged, and would not roply. \" Oh !\" added Heron, \" if that is to be the state of affairs \u2014 if living men wiU give no information, dead ones tell no tales ! Shoot these two fellows at once, T.m!\" Tom raised a shout as the well-known accents of Felix Heron came upon his ears in that voice i \" The Captain ! the Captain !\" he cried. \" It is the Captain himself!\" There was a crashing sound among the bushes and in a few seconds Felix Heron and Daisy reached the spot where the singular encounter had taken place. CHAPTER LXXVII. CAATAIN HERON AND TOM RIPON RIDE TO LON- DON, AND TAKE MEASURES FOR THE RESCUE OF FDITH. \"Hurrah!\" cried Tom. \"Three cheers for ns, Anthony There's the Captain himself 1\" No. 27.\u2014 Edith."], [216, "210 EDITH HERON. \" You can get behind me, on Daisy ; and you, Anthony, need only mate yonr way to Greenwich, where you will find plenty of means of reaching Castleneau House, whither I wiU soon bring your dear mistress, or I wUl perish in the attempt.\" \" Captain,\" said Tom Ripon, \" I have a horse grazing on the heath.\" \"That, then, is better still. Anthony can ride it, and you can still, as I have said, Tom, ride behind me on Daisy.\" The arrangement suited Tom very weU, and the Uttle party were soon on the road to London. Captain Heron had an interested motive in taking Tom up behind him, which was that he might hear from him on the road aU he had to tell him about Edith and the strange adventures that had befaUen her since he, Heron, had last looked upon her at Whitcombe House. Alas! what a weary lapse of time seemed to have lagged past since that most mistaken and eventful evening ! Tom Ripon was full and circumstantial in his narrative ; and when he came to teU Heron how his mother had called at Castleneau House, and how she was still in the service of Jonathan WUd, at the honse in Newgate Street, a ray of hope came over the heart of Felix Heron. \" Yes, Captain.\" \"We are alone here, then, if you must know,\" growled one of the men. Tom kept the pistol he had stUl in his hand, close to the head of the man ; and Captain Heron questioned him with a sharp, sudden firmness that seemed to compel answers frem him. \" What do you here, and whom do you seek in this place?\" \"Jonathan WUd brought us, and we were to take the Earl of Whitcombe.\" \"Where is WUd?\" \" Gone to town.\" \" Ah ! and with whom ?\" \" The two ladies that came here.\" \" Edith and my mistress !\" cried Anthony. \" Oh, Mr. Felix, Mr. Felix, this is a dreadful game at cross purposes ! They came here in search of yon, and have faUen into the hands of the villain Wild!\" \" That's about it;\" said Tom. FeUx Heron reeled npon the saddle of Daisy, as though he had been seized by some sudden and mortal iUness. For some few seoonds he could make no reply, and then drawing one of the pistols from his saddle, he pointed it at the man who had spoken, and in a voice that had a terrible seriousness about it, he cried ont, \" If you wish to exist one half minute longer on this side of eternity, tell me, whither has the viUain WUd conveyed his pri soners ?\" \" Ah !\" he said, \" she will\u2014 she must be kind to my poor Edith 1\" \" Oh, yes, Captain. The old gal will be kind to her, you may depend. But what do you mean to do, Captain \u2014 that's the question ?\" \" I don't know, Tom.\" Tom whistled. \" To his own honse, in London.\" \" In Newgate Street ?\" \" Yes, sir ; the house that goes by the name of Little Newgate.\" The countenance of Felix Heron was, for a few seconds, agitated by violent emotion, and then he made one of those great efforts which men like him can only make, and to aU outward seeming he was calm and cool. \" You are right \u2014 you are right 1 There must be some defiaed plan of action ; but my spirits are in too great a state of excitement at present to be able to say what it can be. I will think, though \u2014 I wiU think ; for it would be to do Edith but little good if I were to fling myself into the jaws of de struction.\" \"Tom Ripon!\" \"Yes, Captain?\" \" These men must be secured somewhere, so that they may not be mischievous.\" \" To be sure, Captain I\" \" There are plenty of gloomy holes fa the base ment of the castle, which wUl hold them well.\" \" All right, Captain I Now, my fine feUows, the sooner you foUow me the better ! Anthony, yon Bhow the way.\" \" That I can do weU,\" said Anthony, \" as far as the haU.\" \" That's the real truth, Captain,\" said Tom ; \" and if you don't mind me saying what I think \" \" Say on, Tom \u2014 say on.\" \" Why, Captain, you see it's now daylight\" \" Yes, yes ! I see.\" \" Wei!, then, in about six hours from now it will be getting dark, and there will be due time to set about doing something for the Lady Edith.\" \" Six hours ! \u2014 six long hours !\" \" Oh, they wiU soon pass away. And you can't think that even Jonathan WUd, for his Use's sake, can be anyhow than civil to the Lady Edith?\" \" No, no 1 He dare not 1\" \"That's just what I say, Captain. Suppose, then, that we go quite quietly to old Castleneau House, and then in the evening we will make our way to Newgate Street, and see what is going on there ? What do you say to that, Captain ? I shall, I daresay, be able to find some way of speak in'g to the old gal, and finding ont all that has happened.\" \" You are right, Tom \u2014 you are right My own excited feelings would prompt me to ride at once to Jonathan Wild's house ; but I feel you are right, and that the utmost caution wUl be necessary.\" Tom was weU pleased that he had gained his point with Felix Heron ; for he considered that to go to Jonathan's house in broad daylight, would be to court the destruction that he, Wild, was only too desirous should faU npon their heads. It was with a truly sad heart, however, that Heron tamed Daisy's head towards Castleneau Honse. \" You had better kiU us at once,\" said one of Wild's men, \" than shut us up to starve to death in that old place.\" \" If you prefer it, certainly,\" said Heron. \" You can both be hanged here, if you think it pre ferable.\" \"No, no!\" \"While there's Ufe there's hope,\" said the other. They both followed old Anthony, and. Tom Ripon brought up the rear, with a pistol in each hand. \" Q _ick\u2014 oh, quick, Tom !\" cried Heron, as they disappeared among the trees. Tom was as quick as it was possible to be, and having with Anthony's assistance secured the two murderous rascals in one of tho gloomiest rooms of Severndroog Castle, he came back to Heron. \"Now, Captain, only say the word, what shaU we do next?\" \" To London, Tom.\" \" AU right !\""], [217, "211 EDITH HEKON. \" Oh ! I am quite sure about it, Captain. Jonathan WUd is no fool, and he knows well enough that ill-usage of any sort wonld not answer his purpose.\" \" It may be eo, and I hope it is.\" \" You may depend it is, Captain. And here we are on Snow Hill, and there goes the ohimes of of St. Sepulchre's clock 1\" It was half-past nine. Rather an early hour in the evening for the enterprise they were upon ; but the impatience of Heron wonld not permit him to remain any longer at Castleneau House. The idea struok him of sending for the young Earl of Bridgewater ; but he hesitated so to do, from a generous motive of not wishing to mix him np with his, Heron's, fallen fortunes. If he could only succeed in rescuing Edith and Lady Castleneau from the clutches of Jonathan WUd, he felt that he would be content to repair to the secret fastnesses of Epping Forest, and bid adieu, at least for a time, to the great world of London, and aU its dangers and all its excitements- Felix Heron was pale and sad as he rode into the court-yard of Castleneau House, with Tom Ripon and old Anthony. It was a dismal story that had to be related to Martha. \" Now, Captain,\" said Tom, \" where wUl you wait while I go and find out the exact state of affairs ?\" And how slowly did the hours pass away that now intervened before the dim twiUght began to steal over London I \" I think I had better wait in Newgate Street, Tom!\" It came at last, however, and then Felix Heron waited anxiously in the hall of Castleneau House for Tom. \" Well, so, perhaps, you had ; and then, if any thing should happen to go wrong, though I don't think that at all likely, you may see some thing of it\" Heron, it wUl be recollected, had left the castle on Shooter's HUl in a disguise which certainly would have had the effect of puzzling even Jona than WUd in regard to his identity, at a mere casual glance. i That disguise he stUl wore, so that he did not look forward to any very particular danger in showing himself in Newgate Street , The early hour, too, of the evening was more favourable than otherwise to concealment, inas much as it was too soon for the streets to be deserted, and amid other passengers, one was not so Ukely to challenge attention. Captain Heron accordingly left Tom at the corner of the Old BaUey, and while he himself crossed over the way, Tom Ripon went boldly np to Jonathan WUd's honse. He was long in coming down stairs \u2014 at least, it seemed long in the impatient estimation of Heron, since he had said he would just go up-stairs and speak to Martha. Then Heron heard, as he thought, Tom's foot steps ; but upon turning to speak to him, he was disappointed. Instead of Tom, he saw a young woman, with a close old bonnet, and a gay cloak, and a pair of pattens in her hand. Felix Heron stepped aside to let her pass, think ing that she was some acquaintance of Martha's, or possibly a servant of the house that he had not seen. \" Come on, Captain,\" said the seeming young woman. \" All's right I\" \"What? Tom?\" \" Oh, yes, Captain. You see, I have put on these female woman's things, because I want to see the old gal at Wild's house. I rather think they wUl let me in, looking as I do now ; and if so, I shall get all the news I want about the olo. ladv and Lady Edith.\" Heron pressed the hand of Tom in both his, as he said, \" The disguise is capital, Tom, and carries abont with it an assurance of success.\" Tom's disguise was admirable, and might have deceived any one. No wonder that it imposed upon the man who was, as Wild caUed it, \" on the lock \" at his house. Dab went the knocker, as Tom raised it and let it down again, in a purposely blundering manner. Jonathan WUd had established a wicket in the panel of his door now, through which any one demanding to be admitted might be questioned. There were iron bars at this wicket, and tha man who was \" on the look \" now sUd aside the Uttle shutter of the wicket, and looked ont at Tom. \"Well\u2014 what now?\" Tom Ripon only wanted this approval on the part of Felix Heron to make him quite delighted with himself ; and they at once started for the City, with a feeling of hope that had been a stranger to the heart of Heron, from the moment that he had last looked into the dear eyes of his much-loved Edith. \" Oh, if you please, sir \" \"Eh?\u2014 woU?\" They went on foot, for Captain Heron had no wish to expose Daisy to the possible dangers of the enterprise he was npon. Old Anthony promised to take every possible care of the noble creature, and Tom likewise had commended what he caUed his horse to the care of the old serving man. \" If you please, sir, I'm Mary Jane.\" \" What's that tome?\" \" Nothing, if yon please, sfr ; only I've bronght the ribbon, sir.\" \"The what?\" \"The sarcenet ribbon, sir, you pleases, for your good lady.\" \" My good lady ! why, you are mad ! I have no good lady. ' Get along with yon, do!\" Bang went the Uttle shutter of the wicket, and at the same moment that it did so, Tom, nothing daunted by the reception he had met with, and which he fuUy expected, knocked at the door again with a sullen sort of dab of the old knocker. The man opened the wicket in a rage. \" What do yon want now ?\" \" Oh, if you please, sir, I'm Mary Jane.\" \"Go to the deuce I\" There was no moon in the still and tranquil heavens that night. No twinkUng star sent even its small modicum of light down upon the earth. All was stili, and beneath the cloudy canopy that hid the soft blue night sky, scarcely a breath of air was to be felt. Captain Heron sighed more than once, and Tom, who walked in his female garments by Heron's side, strove all he could to comfort him and give him hope. \"Captain, you need not be in the least fear about the Lady Edith.\" \" It is kind of you to say so, Tom.\" \"Yes, sir; \u2014 but is not yonr name Ripon, sir?\""], [218, "212 EDITH nERON. \"Ripon? Ripon? My name Ripon? No, I should think not!\" \" And ain't you the husband of the good lady as is called Ripon ?\" \"Not if I know it\" \" Then it's all a mistake, sir, and though I was sent to Mrs. Ripon with the ribbon to this house, its some other house ali the whUe.\" The singing ceased. The door was then opened, and Tom saw hia mother ; but he was resolved to try if his disguise would impose upon her, and he spoke in a feigned voice. \" If you please, mum, is your name Ripon ?\" \" Well, and if it is, hnssey, what do you want, eh?\" \" Oh, nothing much, mum. It's only a refer ence.\" \" A what ?\" \" A reference, mum, if yon please.

RIPON IN WILD's HOUSE. \"Bah! yon fool!\" cried Jonathan WUd's door keeper ; \" I understand all about it, now. It's Mrs. Ripon, the housekeeper, you want, I sup pose.\" \" If yon please, sir.\" \" WeU, I don't think there can be much harm in letting snch a fool as yon into the honse.\" \" No, sir.\" \" Come in.\" \" Goodness gracious !\" \" No, mum.

And as he has made an offer to me, I thought \" Mrs. Ripon uttered a scream. \" An offer to you I Yon! The Reverend Mor tification aU ve still, and make an offer to yon ! Only let me get hold of you \" Tom was more active than his mother ; and al though she made a dart at him, he dexterously avoided her, and making his way into the kitchen, he reached the further end of it, and entrenched himself behind a chair before his mother could take any measures to prevent him. \" Yes, sir.\" The door wag opened, and Tom, with a look of the greatest possible stupidity, walked into the hall. \" Go down stairs \u2014 not that way, you fool ; right along the passage, and down those steps, and then straight on.

Although he now might fairly consider that his principal danger and difficulty in getting into Jonathan Wild's house had passed away, Tom Ripon did not permit himself for a moment to run any risks by forgetting his disguise. WeU he knew that carious eyes were in and abont that house of crime and secrecy; and he might even at that moment be nnder the observa tion of Jonathan himself. \" You wretoh ! You vile hnssey !\" \"\" Oh, don't be in a passion, mum ! It's only a reference. He said as he thought it was only a proper thing, as he was making an offer to me, to refer to yon, mum.\" \" I'U refer yon both in abont half a minute, I wUl! Take that!\" The only missUe that came quite handy to Mrs. Ripon was a cup of tea, and that she bestowed upon him with a liberality that sent it streaming down his face. \" The deuce !\" said Tom. \" Now get out of this house, do ; and if you don't be quick about it, I'U soon find one who wUl make you.\" \" Bless ns 1\" said Tom ; \" I'm sure he's a very nice man ; and he's mighty fond of me, and says I'm a deal better-looking than either of his last six wives.\" Tom accordingly hopped along the long, dark passage, and uttered several little well-acted feminine coughs as he went. At the end of the passage was a door which led into that identical kitchen where the Rev. Morti fication, and the ladies, had been enjoying them selves so mnch previous to the arrival of Wild a short time since. Mrs. Ripon could stand this no longer, and was making a rush at Tom, when he felt confident he heard a heavy footstep in the passage. \"Hnsh! hush, mother!\" he said at once, in his natural voice \u2014 \" hush ! Listen, and tell me if that is Jonathan Wild ?\" Tom listened at this door. Mrs. Ripon knew her son instantly, and uttered a shriek that was only half suppressed. \" There, now,\" said Tom, \"you just have done it now, mother 1\" \" Oh, what wiU become of ns ? Why \u2014 oh, why did you \" Tom darted towards his mother, and clapped his hands on her mouth. He heard a carious noise from the other side of it * What could it he ?

One of the dreary psalms which the Reverend Mortification had been in. the habit of chanting for the purpose of keeping up his clerical charaoter. \"Good gracious!\" said Tom to himself; \"the old gal should not try that caper !\" But it was a satisfaction to him to know that \" WiU yon be quiet?\" \"Yes\u2014 yes; but \" \" Hush I\" \" I only \" \" Hush 1 \u2014 hush, I say !

The half-hour that Jonathan WUd had aUowed him was fast flying away, and beyond the mere fact of the tea he had no infor mation to give to the Captain. The kitchen door at this moment was opened again, and the man of the name of Atkins, who was one of Jonathan WUd's principals, called out, \" I say, Mother Ripon, the governor wants you to cook a chop, and pnt it on a tray, with some cho colate.\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd. I thought, however, that a young girl, just to help me to put my new grogrum to rights, wouldn't be in your way at all.\" \" Get ont !\" shouted Wild, as he strode into the kitchen, and pointed to the door, while he eyed Tom with a maUgnant and ferocious expres sion. \" Get out, ugly I\" said Mrs. Ripon. \"Be quick about it, too,\" added the bull-dog, \" or you will have the governor here himself. Lovely Mrs. Ripon, what do you mean by calling me ngly ?\" Mrs. Ripon flung a plate at him. \" Dear me !\" said Tom, when they were alone again ; \"you and that one of them don't seem to get on well.\" \" The wretch,\" repUed Mrs. Ripon, \" has made me an offer, but I scorn him. Oh, Tom, is it true that the Rev.

Ripon, that Jonathan Wild, towards the end of it, felt half stunned. \" Hold your confounded tongue !\" he said. \" H this girl can do what you want in half-an-hour, she may stay to do it, but after that time I wiU pack her off.\" With these words, Wild left the kitchen, and Mrs. Ripon was about to embrace Tom, when he gave her a push, and a look to be cautions. Tom had not the least doubt in the world but that WUd was on the outer side of the door, listen ing. \" I should think so.\" \" He was a fine man.\" \" There's no accounting for taste, mother. He always seemed to me like a walking lamp-post Bat yon be quick about the chop and the choco late. I have an idea.\" \" A what, Tom?\" \" An idea! Good gracious, you know what an idea is, mother ! Now, be quick, do 1 Cook the chop and the chocolate, for I wonld wager any thing they are both for Edith and Lady Castle neau.\" Mrs. Ripon was not long in preparing what had been ordered by Wild; and then Tom took upthe tray on which she placed the refreshment, and said, \" Now, mother, my idea is that I wUl'take take these things myself to whoever is to have them.\" \" WeU, mum,\" said Tom, \" if I was you, I'd have it done in the new flutes, I would ; that's all the fashion now, mum.\" \" Bo !\" cried Wild, as he put his head into the kitchen again, and then actually and finally took his departure. \" Mother,\" whispered Tom, \" there is no time to lose.

Along the passage he went with it until he reaohed the hall, and then in the coolest way in the world he said, \"Oh, if you please, I'm to take this to Mr. Wild \u2014 if yon please, where is he ?\" The couple of janissaries who were in the hall looked surprised ; but the confident and easy tone in which Tom spoke made them think that it might be really as he had said. \" Mr. Wild is up-stairs, my lass,\" said one. \" The first door you come to,\" said the other. \" YeB, if you please,\" said Tom. \"I say, Uttle 'un!\" \" What do you say ?\" \" You'll give a fellow a kiss, won't you, before you go?\" \" Ob, dear, no !

He followed the instructions of the men, and gave a kick at the first door he came to, which was immediately responded to by the voice of Jonathan Wild caU ing out, \" Come in !\" Holding the tray with one hand!, Tom opened the door with the other; and, to the intense astonishment of Jonathan WUd, marched into the room, with the tray, and the chop, and the choco late. used to say often \u2014 ' when one's dead,' father says, says he \" \"Silence!\" \" Yes, sir I\" Wild paced the room to and fro, and muttered to himself, \" Fools and rogues ! Fools and rogues ! Those are my materials. This girl, with her in fernal stupidity, might suit me here very well ! Hem ! hem I My dear !\" \" Yes, sir I\" \"Would you like to go into the service of a gentleman?\" \" Oh, wouldn't I ! Gimini ! wouldn't I, if so be as I could !\" \" I wUl take you, then !\" \"You, sir? Well, who would have thought that a good-looking gentleman, like yon, would have said such a thing \" \"Good-looking!\" replied WUd, with amaze ment. CHAPTER LXXIX TOM RIPON SUCCESSFULLY IMPOSES ON JONA- THAN WILD, AND MEETS WITH AN ADVEN- TURE IN THE CITY. Jonathan Wild had never been so grea'ly flat tered in all his Ufe before, as to be caUed good looking. He almost smiled. Here was quite a young girl, who had eyes In her head, and who was manifestly too intensely stupid to flatter any one, who expressed, no doubt, her true and genuine opinion, that he, Jonathan Wild, was good-looking. Wonders would never cease. Jonathan was sitting on a table \u2014 that was always a favourite place of his ; but at the sight of the supposed young girl who was the visitor of Mrs. Ripon, he was so astonished that he drew his feet up, and fairly stood on the table. \"What's the meaning of this?\" he roared. \" What brings you here?'' \" The chop.\" \" What ?\" \" And so, my lass, you really think I am not quite ugly.\" \" Lor', sir, who could ever think as you was ?\" \" Very good. You shall stay here. I will put, confidence in you. You shall want for nothing. You shall have an indulgent master, and plenty of finery. Come now \u2014 foUow me with that tray.\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" The chocolate, if yon please, sir. Mrs. Ripon is so busy with the grogrum that she says to me, ' Mary Jane,' says she, ' just take the tray,' says she, ' to Mr. Wild,' says she ; and so here it is, if you please, sir.\" The look of stupidity with which Tom spoke completely staggered Wild. He leaped from the table, and, folding his arms over his breast, he said, \" What's your name ?\" \" Mary Jane, sir.\" \" Mary Jane what?\" \" Smit, sir.\" \" And always remember one thing \u2014 which is, that my favour depends upon your secrecy !\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Do you know what I mean by that ?\" \" Oh, dear me, yes ! One isn't to kiss and tell.\" \" Ingenuous simpUcity,\" growled Wild. \" How sweetly nature brings up her children, to be sure. My dear, there is another meaning ; and it is, that whatever yon see, or whatever you hear in this honse, must be kept entirely to yourself !\" \" Oh, dear, yes, to be sure !\" \"If you blab about anything here, you will find that you have committed some robbery, and wUl be hanged !\" Tom pretended to begin to cry. \"Oh, if you please, sir, I don't want to be hanged\u2014 indeed I don't; sir, and I won't blab, sir, indeed I won't !\" \" Follow me, then. Hear, see, but say nothing.\" WUd took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and preceded Tom Rip .n and the tray, on which was the chop and the chocolate. One of WUd's keys opened that iron-grated door, which he had had erected on the staircase, so as to prevent any one from visiting the upper part of the house without his leave. Passing through that door, Jonathan led the way to the attics, and then Tom Ripon felt that at \" Smit ? Smit ? Smith, you mean ?\" \" No, sir, it's Smit. It were Tims ; but father, afore he was hanged, thought as Smit sounded better ; and says he, ' it's all the same in regards of the letters ; and any of the family,' says father, says he, 'may change it back again,' says father, says he \" \u2022' Hold yonr stupid gabble I\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" How old are you ?\" \" Please, sir, I ain't old.\" \"Good heavens, you are enough to drive any one mad ! Since you must be so very exact, what's your age?\" \" I'm seventeen, sir, next birthday but one, as never was \u2014 leastways, if I live as long, sir ; and if I don't I shan't ; ' for when one's dead,' as father"], [221, "EDITH HERON. 215 all events he had solved one question in regard to the prison of Edith and Lady Castleneau. He knew whether that place of confinement was in the upper or lower part of Wild's house. Bnt Tom had yet ssme more most important in formation to get. Upon reaching the top of the attic stairs, Jona than turned, and addressed the supposed Mary Jane. Jonathan WUd came into the attio from the open air. Through one half of the lattice window, from the parapet of the house, he made his way, and leaped lightly upon the floor. Then he closed the window. \" Still obstinate,\" he muttered; \"still as obsti nate as ever ! She wiU not write what I require of her, and I dare not resort to the measures that might compel her to do so.\" Tom Ripon dropped from the door, and stood quietly on the landing. Jonathan WUd opened the attic door, which he had taken the precaution to lock on the inside, and came out. \" You wUl wait here, now.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \" Give me the tray.\" Wild took the tray in one hand, and unlocked an attic door with the other. Tom Ripon did all heconld to get a glimpse into that attic ; but the faint Ught that made its way into it from a lantern that stood on a bracket at the stair-head, was not sufficient to enable him to see any one. Tom was rather surprised, at the same time, not to hear some voice. \"Well?\" he said; \"weU, girl, what do you think of all this ?\" \" Oh, if you please, sir, I never think.\" \" An excellent quality !\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Come on. FoUow me !\" He fully expected to have heard Edith say some- \"Sir! sir! thing. \" Well, what is it ?\" \" Don't you mean me to stay here for good ?\" \" I do. I have said as much.\" Or the Lady Castleneau might have uttered some remonstrance. But no ; aU was as profoundly still as if that attio had no inhabitants bat spiders or mice. WUd closed the door. \" Then, sir, I'd better run home and get my things. I can easy make a bundle of 'em, and then I can come back here, and I needn't go out any more, you see, sir.\" \" No, no ; that won't do. If you go home, yon \u25a0will be advised not to come back here, and I shaU lose you.\" \" Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" said Tom, in a half cry ing tone ; \" I meant to say that I had met my aunt, Mrs. Charlotte Mumbles, from the country, and she was waiting for me at the Saracen's Head, on Snow HUl.\" Tom was disappointed. There he stood npon the landing, and ap peared to be shut out from aU chance of obtaining any further information. He tried to look through the keyhole. No. He found some obstruction to his eyes, which effeotuaUy stopped that mode of obtaining information. But he could see all about him very weU upon the landing, by the Ught of the small lantern on the bracket Wild langhed. \" Come, come ! you are not nearly snch a fool as I thought you. Go ; bnt be sure and come back as soon as it is possible to do so.\" \"Oh, won't I, sir 1\" Jonathan Wild himself accompanied Tom Ripon down the stairs and to the house door, and as he let him out he said to the bull-dogs there on duty, \" You wUl know this girl again \u2014 she is to be admitted.\" Looking, then, so about him, Tom saw that at the top of the door there was a smaU swinging piece of brass, somewhat simUar in size and in shape to those that are commonly used to cover key-holes to exclude dust. The use of this little object struck him in an instant. It covered some Uttle spy-hole, through which Jonathan could take a sly and sUent peep at any prisoner who might occupy that room. The mischief of it was, that it was a Uttle oat of Tom's reach. \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" Tom was free again. He was on the pavement of Newgate Street, and he no longer breathed the air of Jonathan WUd's terrible house. Not out of reach of his upstretched arms, but above his eyes. It was but a very frail hold that Tom could get by his toes on the panel of the door ; but by that hold\u2014 Ught as it Was\u2014 and by clutching the lock likewise, Tom was able to raise himself up sufficiently to look through WUd's little hole of espial into the attic. AU dark. But he did not allow himself to forget neces sary caution. He might still be watched, for aU he knew to the contrary \u2014 indeed, it was more than probable that he was so. LnckUy he had abstained from saying anything in regard to the direction in whioh the supposed home of Maria Jane lay, so that it was competent to him, upon leaving WUd's house, to go either to the right or to the left, without exciting any suspi cion. That Captain Heron wonld be on the watch for him, he well knew. Tom turned to the right on descending the steps of WUd's house, and took his way up New gate Street He soon heard the footsteps of Captain Heron close behind him. AU vacant. Tom felt certain that no one was there. The certainty puzzled him immensely. Where was Wild ? What did he do in that place, with a chop and some chocolate, and no one to give them to ? Tom Ripon's posture on the door was rather an irksome one, and he was on the point of letting himself drop to the landing again in a most un satisfied frame of mind, when a faint flash of Ught came before his eyes, and banished the dark ness of the attic for an instant \" Not yet!\" said Tom, in a low voice. Heron, then, forbore to speak to him until they got nearly to the top of the street ; and then Tom turned into Panyer Alley, and came to a stand- tiU. Tom held on. ' He forgot all the fatigue, and aU the musoular strain it was to maintain his position, in the inte rest of what he observed. \u2014 \u2014 Heron was by his side in a moment. \"Speak, Tom\u2014 speak!\""], [222, "216 EDITH HERON. \"Yes, Captain\u2014 she is therel\" \"Edith?\u2014 Edith?\" \" To be sure, Captain ; and Jonathan Wild is paying great attention to her !\" \" How \u2014 how do you mean?\" \" She is having chops, and chocolate, and tea. Bnt step into this old doorway, Captain, and I wiU tell you aU abont it\" They did so ; and Tom related to Felix Heron all that had taken place at Jonathan Wild's house. \" Then, Tom, you did not see Edith ?\" \"No, Captain.\" \" Nor hear her voice ?\" \" Oh, I oan tell the old girl, you know, Cap tain ; and won't there be a little bit of a low be tween her and the Widow Brown, and no mis take !\" Heron made no answer to these pleasant felici tations of Tom's, on the prospeot of the disturb ance that was sure to ensue to the felicity of the Reverend Mortification; but he went at once out into the aUey, and from thence to Newgate Street. St. Paul's clock struck eleven. \" Come on, Tom,\" said Heron, \" and let us look at Wild's house weU, and the houses on the right hand side.\" \" I am half afraid, Captain, that I shall be seen ; and, if I am, it will be all up with Maria Jane!\" \" True, true ! \u2014 and you may still want to make your way into WUd's honse. I wUl go alone, Tom.\" \" Certainly not, Captain ! Wild has got her on the top of the house \u2014 a No, no I Oh, how stupid I am 1\" \"What?\u2014 what?\" \" Captain, it's as clear as possible that Wild has got the house, or part of it, next to his e wn old one in his possession, and that it is there we must look for Edith.\" \" Yes, Captain, and I wUl wait for you here abouts.\" Captain Heron was about to acknowledge the truth of this supposition, when, leaning acci dentally rather heavUy against the door where they were conversing, Heron found it give way, and he narrowly escaped a fall into the dark passage beyond. \"Hilloa, Captain!\" said Tom. \"What's that?\" \" Do so\u2014 do so.\" Heron walked to the opposite side of the way, and took a long look at \" Little Newgate.\" The wall of the real, actual, big Newgate was on the westward side of the house, and the dwell ing on the eastern side had on its ground floor a shop of some sort Felix Heron could hardly reconcUe to his own mind the two apparent facts that the npper part of any house could be devoted to the purposes of such a man as Jonathan Wild, while in the lower anything in the shape of a legitimate business was carried on. \" This door is open, Tom !\" \"So it seems!\" Tom made his way some few paces into the passage, and Captain Heron followed him. A faint light from the reflection of a lamp in Paternoster Row shone up the alley ; and as Tom and Cap tain Heron were on the point of emerging from the passage of the honse, they saw that this light was interrupted by the approach of some one. The person came directly np to the door of the house in whioh, to a certain extent, Tom Ripon and Felix Heron were. \" Tom,\" he said, \"I fancy, after all, we must be mistaken in some way.\" \" No, Captain, no ! It's all as you have guessed. Jonathan has the upper part of that house ; and see, the door is opening, and some one is coming out.\" A servant-girl, with a jug in her hand, came ont of the honse next door to Jonathan Wild's, They both stood up as close to the wall of the passage as they could. The person pansed at the open door. He spoke. \" Yea, as the Psalmist says, an open door en courageth the thief !\" Tom knew the voice. Felix Heron was upon the point of stepping over the way to speak to her, when Tom Ripon interfered. \" Let me, Captain\u2014 let me ! She may be afraid of yon.\" Tom, in his feminine costume, stepped over the way, and going up to the girl, he said, in half crying tones, \" Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! perhaps you won't mind telling me if Mr. Smith is at home ?\" \" Mr. Smith ? I don't know any Mr. Smith.\" \" Don't he lodge there ?\" \" No, certainly.\" \" Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! I thought he did. Is not the house let out in lodgings?\" \"No, it isn't My master, Mr. Black, keeps the warehouse, and he lets all the npper part to the horridest wretch in all the world, and his name is Wild ; and I have given a month's notice, and mean to leave all on that account, for the most horrid noises come in the night, so that aunt and I, who sleep in the kitchen, can't abear the place. And he has put np on the top of the first flight of stairs an iron gate and a door, and it looks for all the world as if we was in a cage ; and I for one won't stand it, and so I shall go at the end of my month!\" Felix Heron knew it likewise. There could be no question but that it belonged to the Rev. Mortification. \"Yea,\" he added, \"the Widow Brown is of small discretion! She said that the door would open to a good push, bnt, lo ! I find it swinging on its hinges ! As the Psalmist says, I hunger for my supper!\" The Rev. Mortification walked into the passago and closed the door. He put np a chain, and he drew a bolt \" Yea, fast bind, fast find ! With fear and with tribulation have I come into this neighbourhood, for at each step I thought I might meet that rascal, Jonathan WUd ; but, lo ! I have avoided him ; and now for the Widow Brown ! Amen I\" The Reverend Mortification stumbled along the dark passage, and made his way up the stairs to the first floor. \" Bless us 1\" said Tom. \" That's father-in-law, Captain, I'm sure!\" \" Never mind, Tom \u2014 never mind ! Let him alone. We have other work on hand, now. Come This young woman was evidently one of those persons who, when they have anything on their minds, are quite disposed to make a confidant of the first person they meet, and feel an immense mental relief in so doing. \" Dear me !\" said Tom ; \" it's dreadful to think of ; but you are quite right.\" away at once.\" \"AU's right, Captain!

CHAPTER LXXX. CAPTAIN HERON AND TOM RIPON SOCCESSFCJLLY INVADE LITTLE NEWGATE. \"Captain,\" said Tom, when he rejoined FeUx Heron, \"I know all about it now.\" Tom then related to Heron all that the girl had told him, and Heron made hij determination at once. \" Tom, we will go into that house, and so make our way ta Edith.\" \" Hurrah I\" No. 28.\u2014 Edith. \" Hush I hush ! Come along, and I will take the first step in tha matter.\" Captain Heron crossed over the way, and rang at die bell of the houae next to Wild's, but at the moment he did so Tom Eipon found ont that he might have spared himself the trouble, for the very communicative yonng girl who had gone out with the jug, no doubt to the neighbouring public house, had adopted tbe common practice, to save herself trouble, of leaving the door what is caUed \" a- jar.\" It yielded to a touch. Tom aud Captain Heron therefore found them selves, as they hoped, without being beholden to any one, beneath the same roof with Edith. But Heron had rang the bell, and tbe conse quence was, that hardly were they fairly within the house, when the faint flash of a light, as it was brought up the kitchen stairs by some one, could be seen in tho passage. \" Hold the door a moment,\" said Heron."], [224, "218 EDITH HERON. \" Nothing, madam,\" replied Heron ; \" and that is just the amount of what I want you to do.\" \" Then, sir, I don't comprehend you !\" \" Yon easily will, madam, when I tell you that all I ask of you is that you will kindly sit still here, and take no notice of my proceedings in the house.\" \" Oh, no, no ! I oanno.\u2014 I dare not !\" \" Wherefore can you not ?\" \" How do I know but you have come to rob the warehouse ?\" Tom did so, and Captain Heron then darted for ward to the top of the stairs, and was just in time to oome face to face with an elderly female, who, in answer to the ring, was coming up with a light There was no time for expostulation or explana tion just then. Heron's object was silently and expeditiously to get possession of the house. He took a handckerchief from his pocket, and clapping it in a screwed up form upon the mouth of the elderly female, he placed his disengaged arm round her waist, and fairly lifting her off her feet, he carried her down the kitchen stairs. Captain Heron hardly knew how to get over this latter difficulty, and he sighed deeply as he said, \" Ah, madam, I do think that the mere fact of our arguing the matter with you ought to suf fice; but may I ask if you have never heard of one Felix Heron, who became Earl of Whit combe ?\" All this was done with such promptitude, and so neatly, that the old dame fonnd herself in the kitchen again, and still carrying the light, before she knew what had happened. Then she tried to scream, but Felix Heron whispered in her ear, \" Not a word \u2014 not a word ! I am a friend, and if you wUl be still, nothing wUl happen but what will rejoice you.\" Tom Ripon had held the street door until he saw that Heron had fairly captured the old woman, and then he ran down the kitchen stairs after him, to see if any help was required. It was then that the girl with the jug returned, and finding the door just as she had left it, namely, \" ajar,\" she stepped into the passage, and then closed and locked it after her. \" Gracious ! yes, I have !\" exclaimed the niece. \" I went up-stairs and listened, one day, at the gate, and the door that Jonathan Wild has put up on the staircase, and I heard the wretch say, ' So much for my Lord Whitcombe ! Edith once in my power, and all is well I' \" \" Ah !\" cried Heron, \" Edith is my wife!\" \" Then,\" said the aunt, \" do I indeed speak to an Earl?\" \" Yes. I am that Earl of Whitcombe who, not withstanding my peerage, have so many enemies, that I have to prefer the free air of a forest to t)ie Court of St. James's. Circumstances ef a cruel and exceptionable nature have separated ma from my Countess, and she is in the hands of Jonathan Wild, from whence if I can rescue her without publicity, I would rather do so than by any direct appeal to the law.\" The doubts and fears of the old dame now en tirely vanished. She treated Heron with the greatest possible respect, and only seemed anxious to know how she could possibly serve him. \" There is one thing,\" said Captain Heron, \" that I should suggest to you both. It is, that as it is impossible I can be here to protect you, some means ought to be adopted to shield you from the vengeance of the villain Wild, should he imagine, which he will be but too apt to do, that you have assisted me.\" , \" He will kill us both.\" Another minute, and she was in the kitchen. Down dropped the jug of ale she bad gone to fetch, and but that Tom Ripon caught her round the neck, and placed his hand over her mouth, she would have screamed. \" Don't\u2014 don't I\" said Tom; \" don't! If you say a word, Jonathan WUd will be here, and I'm sure you don't want him.\" \"Murder!\" \" No,\" said Felix Heron. \" No murder, or any other violence, is to be dreaded from ns. My errand here is one that you will both approve of. My wife is in the cm tody of the villain Wild, and she is imprisoned in the rooms he has hired in the npper part of this house. She is innocent of all crime ; and I feel sure that you will both do all in your power to help me to rescue her.\" This speech had a wonderfully reassuring effect upon the two females, and it was no longer to be feared that they would create the least alarm. \" And that,\" said the niece, \" would not be ro mantic at all.\" They looked at Felix Heron, and saw that there was an ingenuous frankness about his face that spoke the natural language of truth. \" Oh !\" cried the young girl who had been for the ale, \" how beautiful aud romantic!\" \" It is romantic, my dear,\" added Heron ; \" and it has along with that the great advantage of being true.\" \" That's it !\" cried Tom. \" It's all true, I assure you, ladies !\" \" But,\" said the aunt, \" I only wonder, sir, that yen bring this yonng person with you, if you are in search of your wife!\" \" That's a very reasonable remark, old lady,\" said Tom ; \" only I don't mind telling you that I am not a young person at all !\" Tom spoke in his natural tones, so that there could be no mistake about his disguise; and, as he accompanied what he said b'y a slight hug round the waist of the niece, she felt certain that there was no impropriety in the transaction. \" Why, it's more romantic stiU !\" she said. \" Oh, how I do love an adventure!\" \" Captain,\" said Tom, \" the best way will be to make believe that we have got into the house, aud made prisoners of this most respectable old lady and her charming niece.\" \" It is one way, Tom.\" \" All's right, Captain ! Here's some twine. Suppose now, ma'am, I make a pretence Of having made you a prisoner to this chair ; and as for you, Miss \u2014 Miss \" \" Matilda.\" a Yes, Miss Matilda, I will pretend to have made you fast to this towel-roller, but I will manage it so that you can both got away at any moment\" Tom, as he spoke, completed his little arrange ment., and Matilda, when she found her hands loo.ely tied behind her, said, \" Oh dear, this is dreadful ! Why, anybody might come into the kitchen and kiss me, without me being able, all of a moment, to scratch his face I Don't !\" Tom had accepted the suggestion, and gave tha fair Matilda ample provocation, in the shapa of kisses, had she been disposed to scratch his face in consequence\u2014 a proceeding, however, which she made no effort to accomplish. \"But,\" added the more cautious aunt, \"what can we do in the matter ?\""], [225, "EDITH HERON. 219 \" Come, Tom, come !\" said Heron ; \" let us now \u00bbet to work for the release of Edith and Lady Castleneau.\" their ears, fsr if that voice were not the voice of Jonathan WUd, never had two voices the same tones so exactly. Leaving the kitchen and the two willing pri soners in it, Heron took his way up the stairs, towards the first floor, and was stopped, as Matilda had said he would be, by an iron grating, and beyond that a door. Tom nearly feU to the floor with the sudden ness of the surprise. Captain Heron, for a few seconds, was quite unable to reply. Then, without apparently being yet able to command his voice, he sprang through the open door that connected the two attics, and beheld a sight that fiUed him with the most unqualified amazement. Both were fast locked. Tom carried a Ught, and by its assistance Heron carefuUy examined the lock of the grating. It was a strong one ; but as the staircase was of wood, it had become a necessity to connect the stronger material of iron with that more easUy overcome material somewhere. No other than Jonathan WUd himself was seated on the edge of a table, whUe a small hand lantern, whioh was on the floor at his feet, threw up his whole form and his hideous features into bold relief, and made him, by the strange direc tion the shadows took, look perfectly demoniac. It was where that junction took place that Heron resolved to set to work. For that purpose he went back into the kitchen, in search of same tools with which to work his way past that grating, and the door beyond it An iron bar of about eight feet in length, that belonged to the kitchen window, formed an im plement of great power in good hands, and with that Heron made his way once more to the grating. There was a straining and clashing noise for a few seconds, and then the deeply-set, strong staples that held a portion of what might be called the framework of the gate, gave way. Without the actual lock then being moved in the least the gate was open. The door did not offer nearly so muoh resist ance as the gate. Probably, Jonathan WUd rather looked npon it as a means of deadening sonnds, than for the purposes of strength. Certainly, it was no obstacle in the way of the iron bar with which Captain Heron, as a lever, assaUed it CHAPTER LXXXI. JONATHAN WILD IS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN SNARE, AND CONVEYED TO THE OLD FOREST. \" Good evening, Captain !\" said WUd. \" Glad to see you\u2014 glad to see you !\" \"ViUain!\" Heron darted forward, and grasping WUd by the coUar with one hand, he held a pistol to his brow with the other. \" Ah !\" said WUd, without seeming to be in the smaUest degree disconcerted at this treatment, \u2014 \" ah ! you are rather hasty, Captain, consider ing you are in another man's house.\" \"Wretch! Monster!\" \" Go on. When you have quite done, I have an interesting communication to make to you.\" \" What hinders me from blowing out your vU lanous brains?\" There was one sharp crack, and the staple of the lock was gone. \" That wUl do, Captain,\" said Tom. \" Here we are !\" \" Your own good sense. I never thought you a downright fool !\" \"Shoot him, Captain \u2014 shoot him!\" cried Tom Ripon. \" It's the best thing to do !\" \"Ah, my Uttle man,\" said WUd, \"are you there ? Let me see ! No, not yet Next sessions \u2014 when you are a few pounds heavier!\" \" What do you mean, you old, ugly vagabond ?\" cried Tom. \" Oh, I was only setffing in my mind when I would hang you \u2014 that's all!\" A cold shudder came over Tom Ripon. Captain Heron shook Jonathan Wild to and fro as though he had been some mere child, without power to resist him. \"Gently, sir\u2014 gently, if you please!\" said WUd. \"Speak, wretch!\u2014 man of a thousand crimes, speak! Where is Edith ?\" \" Oh, the Countess, that was ?\" \"Speak, I say! \u2014 or, by the heaven above us \" \" There, there ! Don't make such a noise about it. Do you think, for one moment, Captain Felix Heron, as you caU yourself, that I would have sat so quiet here and waited for you, if I had not known one thing?\" \" What thing ?\" \" That I was safe !\" \"Despair, then, of your supposed knowledge, for never yet was mortal man in snch immi nent perU as you are, Jonathan WUd, at this mo ment 1\" \" There we differ, Captain.\" Hardly had the words escaped the Ups of Tom Ripon, when they both heard a heavy lumbering noise higher up in the house, and then the sharp sound of the closing of some door that hung but Ughtly on its hinges. Heron sprung forward, ascending three steps at a time. Tom closely followed him ; and quite breathless for the instant, rather from excitement than the haste they made, they reached the top of the staircase, and conld go no further- There were no less than four doors opening from that landing into as many attics ; but Heron was in no mood to stop, in order to make minute observations with regard to which one it would be desirable to open- He turned the key in the first one he came to, and entered it All was darkness, and nobody was there, al though about the air of the attic there was a warm feel, as though a fire had recently been in the grate. \u00b0 ...... . ,, , , rr, ,,,\u2022_! -rr \u2022 1_1 \" A light \u2014 a Ught, Tom !\" said Heron quickly, and quite heedless as to who might hear him. Tom Ripon had matohes with him, although in his feminine apparel it took him some time to find them ; but he did get a light, which no sooner illumined the attic than, from an adjoining one which had a door of communication, a voice cried out, \" I rather think I have the pleasure of a visit from FeUx Heron, pretending to be the Earl of Whitcombe !\" Tom. and Captain Heron could scarcely believe"], [226, "EDITH HERON. 220 what took place the next moment, for Tom Ripon had sUently clambered on to the table behind him, and, having constructed a running noose with a stout piece of cord he had about him, he suddenly slung it over WUd's head, and bringing it down to his ohest, he drew it tight over both his arms, and tied it behind his back, with a speed and dex terity there was no resisting. WUd sprang off the table. \" Down with him, Captain ! Hit him !\" cried Tom. \" Cease this buffoonery, Jonathan Wild ! Where is the Lady Edith?\" \" In peril !\" \"Peril?\" \" Yes ; and yet, if you so wiU it, she is in per feot safety, and may be restored to you at any moment; although, without a perfect accord be tween you and me, that moment will never come.\" There was something so confident about the tone and manner of Jonathan WUd, that Captain Heron was quite staggered at it, and left go of his collar. Jonathan aimed, with one of his heavy boots, a savage kick at Tom Ripon; but Felix Heron obeyed the injunctions of Tom, and knocked Wild down. Tom then sprang upon him, and, feeling in one of his pockets, produced a pair of handcuffs, which he put on him. \" That's all right, Captain ! Now, I think, it's time to turn the tables. Jonathan, you shall be set free on one condition \u2014 and that is, that yon restore the Lady Edith, and that fine old gal, the Lady Castleneau, at once to the Captain.\" WUd looked confused. \" Yes,\" said Heron, \" that forms the only con dition on whioh your life wiU be spared.\" WUd made a desperate effort to free himself from the handcuffs and the cord, but it was quite a f utUe one.\" \" Do not speak in riddles, Jonathan WUd,\" he said. \" I hold your life in my hands !\" \" And I \u2014 what do I not hold ?\" \" Nothing !\" \" Yes; I hold in my hands, so to speak, what is of much greater consequence to you than my Ufe, for I hold the life of Edith.\" \"No, no!\" \" I say, 'Yes, yes!' but I don't make war with women. Not a hair of her delicate head has been injured \u2014 not a disrespectful word has been uttered to her. Tom Ripon!\" Wild uttered Tom's name with such a sudden sharpness, that he started and cried out, \" What do you want with me, Jonathan Wild ?\" \" Pick up the lantern.\" Tom obeyed, mechanically. Jonathan Wild then took from his pocket a folded paper, and handed it to Heron. \"Read!\" \" Felix Heron,\" he said, \" this is the most foolish act you ever did in all your life. You wUl never look again into the fair eyes of Edith !\" \"Don't mind what he says, Captain,\" interposed Tom. \" Let's tie him up securely, and then have a good search through his old crib.\" Heron looked excited and puzzled. \"Come, come, Captain,\" added Tom; \"Jona than Wild will say anything to answer his pur poses.\" \" Please yourseU,\" said WUd. \" Safety for the Lady Edith, or a calamitous trial at the Old BaUey.\" Then Heron appeared suddenly to have made np his mind what to do. \" Tom,\" he said, \" hold this pistol to the head of Jonathan WUd. I do not like bloodshed, and wonld fain avoid it when I can ; but keep the muzzle just between his eyes, so that should there arise the necessity for discharging it, even he may suffer as little pain as possible.\" Tom took up the position indicates by Felix Heron. Heron took the paper, and then Tom, feeling what he had been required to hold the light for, inolined it so that its best rays feU upon the paper which Heron read. As he read it, Wild indulged in a low whistle, so faint that it sounded as though it were but the echo of sound of that character from afar off. The paper was an exact copy of that most im portant document which Jonathan Wild had found in the vault of Westminster Abbey. Carefully watching the eyes of Felix Heron nntU he felt sure that he had read it all, WUd re mained quiet until that moment, and then he said, \" Well, Captain, what do you say to that?\" \" Nothing.\" \" But it says something to you.\" \" It is too absurd to form even the subject of conjecture.\" \" Indeed I\" \" Yes, Jonathan Wild ; and, if it were true, what, in the name of all that's strange, can it concern you ?\" \" That is my affair, Felix Heron ; but, on con dition that you give up all contest for the earldom, and let the representative of the younger branch of your famUy quietly possoss himself of the title and estate, yon will have the Lady Edith and the Lady Castleneau delivered to you in safety this night.\" \" You are mad !\" WUd turned a shade yeUower. Captain Heron then commenced a vigorous search in the attics for some signs of the recent presence of Edith and her aunt, the Lady Castle neau. But there were no apparent hiding-places in those attics ; and beyond the undoubted fact that there had been a fire in the grate of one of them recently, they did not appear to have been oc cupied. Then Heron caUed to Tom Ripon again, saying, \" Tom, I leave you for a brief space of time in charge of Jonathan WUd. I have a further searoh to make in. this honse and in the one adjoining.\" \" AU safe, Captain ! Now, Johnny, mind what you are about, or you are a dead animal !\" WUd looked at Tom Ripon all the savage fero city he was afraid to express, and for a time he said not a word. \" That's not the question.\" \"If I refuse?\" \" I should be sorry.\" \" For yourself ?\" \" No, Captain Felix Heron, I should be sorry for Edith ; because, in that case, she will have to take her trial at the Old BaUey on the capital charge of aiding and abetting a felon, meaning you.\" Felix Heron was staggered for the moment, since he knew perfectly well that the law did con template such an essence. But Jonathan Wild was more staggered stiU at Then he coughed slightly, and seeing that Tom took no notice of that sign that he wished to open a conference, he spoke in the mildest tones he could assume."], [227, "221 EDITH HERON, \" Tom Ripon!\u2014 Tom Ripon !\" \" 1 ain't deaf, Johnny !\" \" No, I did not think you were. What, now, would you say to twenty gold guineas\u2014 eh, Tom Ripon ?\" \" I don't know. It would depend on what they said to me ; for I should be hardly suoh a fool as to say anything to them unless they spoke first\" fostered, that poor Edith might be exposed to tha greatest danger if arraignpd on the charge of \"comforting, aiding, or abetting a felon.\" CHAPTER LXXXII. TOM RIPON AND CAPTAIN HERON MEET WITH AN ADVENTURE ON WILD'S HOUSE-TOF. \"Pho! pho! Don't joke!\" \"Joke! Do you caU that a joke?\" \" I should think so ; but can you be so foolish as to yoke your fortunes to one who is as sure to die on the scaffold as that the sun will rise to morrow ?\" The great objeot, then, of Heron was to rescue Edith and her aunt personally, if possible, and then he would be able to take some measures as regarded WUd, to put au end to his persecutions. If nothing but the Ufe of Jonathan WUd would answer that purpose, Heron felt that he was jus tified in taking that life, belonging, as it did, to one of the blackest and basest of mankind. \"Certainly not\" \"Then, why do you?\" \" I don't ; and, what is more, I don't at aU in tend. What pnt it into your head, Johnny, that I was going to yoke my fortunes, as you caU it, to yours?\" WUd was puzzled and provoked. He could not make up his mind whether these replies arose from stupidity in Tom Ripon, or downright cle verness. Bat that was an extremity to which he hoped not to be driven. The search in the attics of that honse, the upper part of which Wild had hired, and eo shut in from the lower, convinced Heron that his Edith was not there to be found. If the latter, he had no chance of succeeding with him. The walls were of ordinary plaister, and afforded no possible facilities for the construction of any hiding-place. The little skeleton grates were evidently not eon neoted in any way with secret places in the chim neys; and, in fact, so short were those chimneys that a soft, light rain, that began to fill, found its way down them, on to the floors of the attics. \"No,\" said Heron, mournfully, as he took another look about him, in the attic that faced the street ; \" no \u2014 she is not here !\" Then he opened the casement, and looked out into the night-air. He leaped lightly on to the parapet of the house, and, gazing about him, he saw much of the wilderness of chimney-tops and roofs of that part of London. \"Edith! Edith!\" he oried. Bnt he wonld not yet give up the hope of in ducing Tom Ripon to release him from the predi cament in which he just then stood. \" You are quite a boy,\" he said ; \" you have your whole life before you, unless it is cnt short by a rope, which I can put round yonr neck, or keep off it, as I please. Let me free now, and you shall have the word of Jonathan WUd that, come what come may, Jack Ketch shaU never take off your cravat\" \" Thank you, I don't mind it ; but if you had said that he shonld, why, then I might have thought something of it\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" Oh, only that I take whatever you say, Johnny, by contraries, that's aU !\" \" Tom Ripon !\" \" Jonathan Wild I\" His voice sounded strangely at that altitude, and the night-wind carried it in odd echoes about the house-tops. But, alas ! there was no Edith there to reply to him. \" Remember your mother !\" \" I wiU.\" \" Her life is in my hands.\" \" I teU you what, Johnny. If you go on in this sort of way, saying how many people's Uves are in your hands, you will make me beUeve that the best and the shortest way of getting them out, is just to pnU the trigger of this pistol, and put you ont of the way of doing any further mis chief!\" Then Captain Heron made up his mind to a perUons enterprise. He would make his way to Jonathan's house, next door, and there search for the prisoners. Along the parapet there was no difficulty for one so young and agile as Felix Heron to make his way to the attic of Wild's own house ; and, when there, he thought he heard a strange noise at some distance from him, on the roof. The noise came from the back slope of the tiles that then formed the roof of WUd's house ; and here we may inform onr readers who may feel disposed to make a pilgrimage to look at the resi dence of the notorious thief-taker, that the original house so long in the occupation of WUd, was puUed down abont the year 1808, and the present structure raised on the site ; \u2014 that, too, has under gone various alterations since it was built. The ceUars, which were Jonathan Wild's cells, still, however, remain, and go under the roadway in Newgate Street, for a considerable distance. Bat we return to Felix Heron, who, in doubt as to what the noise at the back part of WUd's house portended, crept slowly up the sloping tiles, and peeped over. For a few seconds he saw nothing. Then he saw, or thought he saw, for the shadows \"Don't! don't!\" \" Be quiet, then.\" WUd saw that Tom was not to be moved from his allegiance to Felix Heron, and he registered a vow in his own mind that, notwithstanding his promise to Mrs. Ripon, Tom should be hanged at the next session of the Old Bailey. But, now, leaving Jonathan WUd to the safe custody of Tom Ripon, we feUow FeUx Heron in his search for the lost Edith and her aged, but most noble-hearted and courageous companion in misfortune, the Lady Castleneau. That Wild had both these persons, so dear to him, in his custody, Heron did not doubt The disquietude of his mind in regard to them was not a Uttle increased, likewise, by the obscure threat that the thief-taker had uttered in regard to Edith. It was quite possible and consistent with the mode in which the criminal law was then admi-"], [228, "222 EDITH HERON. I of the chimney-pots rather confused him, and he could not be certain, some dark object on the tiles. The dark object seemed to be about the ordi nary size of a human form. \\ A suarp pang of alarm shot through the heart of Heron. The heart of Heron sank within him. \" It is quite easy, now, to search the place,\" added Boom ; \" for I have cleared the way. You have only to go down the iron staircase at the back of the house, and you wiU get into the ceUs. By the bye, on that very staircase I found, since you speak of ladies, a handkerchief that should belong to one\" \" Ah, give it to me ; it may confirm or dissipate some of my worst fears.\" \" Here it is.\" Was it his Edith that he saw ? The idea was sufficient for the action that imme diately ensued. Heron was over the roof ridge in a moment, and then he saw the dark object raise itself up, and hold out both arms supplicatingly towards him, whUe a faint, low voice, said, \" Mercy ! Oh, have some mercy upon me!\" Heron did not recognise that voice. It was perfectly strange to him ; but from the tones of it he ascertained two things. It came from a man, and it was the genuine ex pression of deep distress. \" Who and what are you ?\" asked Captain Heron, in subdued tones. \" Oh, do not betray me ; but aid me to escape from this house in any way, and at any risk, and you shaU be rewarded to your heart's content. Are you in Wild's service?\" \" Certainly not !\" The stranger on the roof uttered an exclamation of satisfaction on hearing this statement, and then hastily added, \" Can it be that you, too, are escap ing from this den of iniquity ?\" \" No. Are you ?\" \" I am \u2014 I am ! With incredible labour I have got thus far, aud I have made up my mind to die or succeed. I am armed.\" \" Are you, then, a prisoner of Jonathan WUd's ?\" \"No, no!\" repUed the stranger, with anima tion \u2014 \" no ; I will no longer call myself a prisoner to Jonathan Wild, since I have got thus far on my route to freedom.\" The Ught that was upon the roof of the house, compounded, as it was, partly of that faint night light which the clouds, be they ever so dense, must yet permit to permeate the atmosphere, and the reflection of the old street lamps from Newgate Street, was scarcely sufficient to allow Heron to look at the handkerchief that Mr. Boom handed to him. But the touch of it seemed to be enough for Heron. He was certain it had belonged to Edith. The sharp vision of Felix Heron then detected on the delicate white cambric some letters \u2014 some words, ivhich seemed to have been written with charcoal that had become half obliterated. There was not sufficient Ught for him to read them. \" Light ! light ! \u2014 oh, for one gracious ray of Ught,\" cried Heron, \"to enable me read these words !\" Mr. Boom coughed slightly. \" If,\" he said, \" whoever you may be, \u2014 if you have so ardent a desire to see that handkerchief by a better light than the present, and if you wiU promise to aid me to thoroughly escape, I can manage to accommodate you?\" \" I do promise \" \" But can you perform the promise ?\" \" I can, and will ! I am not one to make pro mises that are out of my power ; aud if they are so at the moment, I always qualify them to that extent.\" \" Your name ? Who are you ?\" \" My name is Boom.\" Felix Heron had heard that name from Tom \" Then,\" said Mr. Boom, \"as, under the circum stances, I should never dream of bringing you in a bill of costs for this little conversation on the roof of Jonathan Wild's house, I will, in a friend !y way, show you a Ught, if you wiU come a lttUe lower down.\" Ripon when he gave so very circumstantial an account, as he did, of the adventures which he, Tom, and Edith had had in the old \" Angel Inn \" yard. \" I think I know you, then,\" replied Heron. \" You were in league with Jonathan Wild ; but your interests varied, and he became your enemy, subduing you by his superior craft and unscru pulous action.\" \" Alas 1 alas ! If unsorupulousness wonld only have succeeded, Jonathan Wild would not now have been in a position to become obnoxious to any one.\" Mr. Boom, Jonathan WUd's attorney, never ut tered a truer speech than this in aU his life. He was then as anxious to know who Heron was as Heron had been to question him in regard to his identity ; but he failed in arriving at that information, for in answer to his inquiries, Heron said, \" Be content that you do not find in me an enemy. I am as anxious to make my way into Wild's house as you are to leave it. I seek to set free some persons who have fallen into his hands.\" \" You seek Lord Warringdale, perhaps ?\" \" Is he a prisoner of Wild's?\" \" Indeed, he is ; and occupied the cell next to mine. There are other prisoners in the miserable holes that Jonathan calls prisons, but none of any Heron was by his side instantly. Then Mr. Boom took from the gutter, where he had covered it over with an old hat he had pro bably found in his progress through Wild's house to that elevated position on the roof, a small hand lantern, which sent forth a few faint beams of light. FeUx Heron eagerly held the handkerchief close to the lantern. He saw the embrodered coronet in the corner, with the initials of Edith's name. Then he clasped the handkerchief to his heart, for he had no doubt \u2014 if any, indeed, had lingered in his mind \u2014 that it had really belonged to his Edith. Mr. Boom watched these emotions with surprise. But the writing ou the cambric, faint and indis tinct as it was, became deeply and painfully inte resting to Heron. What he thought was charcoal had been only a damp, mouldy bit of stick, which had, no doubt been pioked up in one of Wild's cells. With great difficulty Heron was able to read the foUowing words : \u2014 moment\" \"Speak truly, sir. Are there two ladies im prisoned in this honse, to your knowledge?\" \"No; I feel certain that there are no such per sons.\" \"Seek me in Newgate, for thither the viUain Wild, in collusion with \""], [229, "EDITH BEBOlv. 223 He conld make out no more. The rest of the writing was by far too indistinct for him to read, but what he had made ont fiUed him with the most sad and painful thoughts. \" In Newgate am I to seek the dear one !\" he Baid. \" Alas ! the stone waUs, and the bolts, and locks at d bars of that terrible place wUl at least for a time baffie me.\" \"Free? Do you mean to say that I can walk out?\" \" You can.\" \"Without let or hindrance, actually walk out into Newgate Street?\" \" Just so !\" \" My dear sir, whoever you are, you may rely upon me, under aU circumstances, to render you any aid, professional or otherwise, for nothing \u2014 literally lor nothing, sir.

Mr. Boom did not stay to hear another word, but darting down the stairs, he was out of sight in an instant \" So, so !\" said Heron, \" this is another pre tender to that coronet which sits so uneasUy upon my brows. I would to heaven I had never heard of the Earldom of Whitcombe. If I had only happUy been born to some modest com petence in the great far-off country, amid the shadows of trees and the songs of forest birds, how happy and how contented I should have been with my Edith !\" Felix Heron did not waste another thought upon Mr. Boon now, but hast.ning into the attic, where he had left Wild with Tom Ripon, he would have been amused, if at that time he could have been susceptible of the feeling, at the sight that presented itself. Jonathan WUd was in a very odd position, right down on the floor. Tom Ripon was close to him, and had hold of the two ends of a piece of cord which was round WUd's neck, and those two pieces were through some open ornamental work in the back of an ancient chair, which was lying on its side on the floor. CHAPTER LXXXIII. JONATHAN WILD FINDS HIS AFFAIRS IN A VERY UNSATISFACTORY CONDITION. That Edith was indeed in the peril which the words on the handkerchief indicated, and which Jonathan Wild himself had hinted at, appeared now to the mind of Felix Heron but too probable- He felt likewise that it was very possible to include Lady Castleneau in the charge that WUd said could be preferred against Edith. It was with his heart saddened and full of these painfnl thoughts that Felix Heron now made his way back to the attics of the next house, where he had left Jonathan Wild in the custody of Tom Ripon. Mr. Boom, who, with incredible pains and per severance, had made his escape from WUd's ceU, solely by the aid of the rusty naU he had there found, followed closely. It was a familiarity of the style of speaking of Felix Heron, and the tone of his voice, that every one to whom he spoke felt an almost imme diate conviction of his truth and sincerity. Mr. Boom, with aU his professional suspicions of mankind in genera], could not but give way to this general impression. He followed Felix Heron with a perfect confi dence that he was on the right track now for es cape. \" What is the meaning of all this, Tom ?\" \" Oh, Captain, he got a little obstropnlons, that's all, and I thought I wouldn't actually shoot him tiU you came, but now I wiU !\" \" No, Tom !\" \" Oh, Captain, it will be so much better !\" \" No, no ! WUd, listen to me. Let him sit up, Tom.\" Tom did so, and Jonathan Wild, very red in the face, sat up The distance was short \" Is Edith in Newgate ?\" \"She is!\" They were in abont one minute and a-half in the attics of the next house. \" And Lady Castleneau ?\" \" She likewise.\" Heron took Boom to the top of the stairs, and pointed downwards. \" Go. You are free !\" \" Release them, or die !\" \" I cannot\u2014 you ought to know that. Although I"], [230, "224 EDITH HERON. \" Tom, you will get out the horses. I am sorry to inflict upon you such a companion as Jonathan Wild; but he must ride behind you, and I wUl take good care that he carries out no 1 1\" H 8, C _\\ 6 TV \u2022 \"Where to?\" cried Wild. \"Where are you going ?\" StiU Heron made hnn no reply. may easily enough place any one in Newgate, I have no power to release them from H.\" \" Then you can only suffer for your want of power to undo mischief which you should have calculated the consequences of, before you set about doing it !\" \"I can't help it!\" said Wild, doggedly. \" Nor I ! Hold him up, Tom !\" \" Yes, Captain !\" Felix Heron put a pistol on fuU cock, and held it to Wild's forehead. \"Once!\" he said. \"Will you release Edith and the Lady Castleneau ?\" \" I cannot !\" The ancient gate of old Castleneau House was opened by Tom Ripon in the manner he usually adopted for that purpose when he arrived along with Captain Heron\u2014 namely, by climbing over it first, and then shooting back the bolts on the inner side. Captain Heron made a sign to Wild to go into the court-yard. \" WeU,\" said Jonathan, \" I don't see the use of your occupying my 'time !\" \"The horses, as quiokly as you can, Tom!\" said Heron. Tom Ripon roused up old Anthony; and in the course of ten minutes both Daisy and the horse Tom caUed his own were saddled and bridled in the court-yard. \" Twice !\" \" I have not the power !\" \" Thrice !\" Wild dosed his eyes ; he might have thought that he was in some danger, or he might not. It would have been difficult to say, with a man of suoh nerve and such compUcated mental emo tions, which was the truth. The probabUity, however, is that he put no faith in the threats of Felix Heron, and that he did not beUeve his life to be in any actual danger. If that were WUd's idea, he was in the right There was a pause of about a quarter of a minute's duration ; and then Heron, to the great disappointment of Tom Ripon, put up the pistol again. WUd looked him in the fsce with a \" What are you going to do now ?\" sort of expression. \" Tom,\" said Heron, \" bring him along !\" \" Yes, Captain !\" \" What is the use ?\" said Wild. \" I con do nothing now I What is the use of troubling me?\" Old Anthony ran ont to speak to Heron. \" Oh, dear, sir ! \u2014 dear, good my Lord _WHt combe, release and bring ns back our dear mistress, and dear Lady Edith, too, bless her sweet eyes !\" \" Yes, Anthony, they shall both come back to you ; but, in order that there should be no disap pointment in their doing so, I neglect them for a brief space, until I have placed this man in durance, so that he shaU have no chance of escap ing me.\" \"Ah!\u2014 who is it? Can it be the bad, bass Warringdale ?\" \" No, Anthony. Come and look at him, and you will know well who it is.\" The old serving-man stepped forward, and looked in the face of Wild. He knew him instantly. \" Until the Countess of Whitcombe and the Lady Castleneau are both at liberty, I shaU keep you as a hostage for their safety !\" Wild looked puzzled. \" Look you here, Felix Heron !\" he said. \" I don't want to be harsh with you! The peerage of Whitcombe is slipping from you 1 Why make an useless struggle about it ? Let it go, and you shall have my best offices about the trial of the Lady Edith! I can produce or keep back what evidence I like !\" Jonathan made one of his most hideous con tortions of countenance ; and then, by way of making old Anthony uneasy if he could, he said aloud, \" I warn you, and all men, that I am a constable ; and as suoh I caU upon you, as I am empowered to do, to aid and assist me in the capture of a criminal ! The consequences of a refusal you wUl find out when I am at liberty and leisure to attend to you !\" \" It is the viUain, WUd !\" said Anthony, with out paying any attention to these words from Jonathan. \" Bring him along, Tom I\" was all that Felix Heron condescended to say in reply to this speech from Jonathan WUd. Tom conducted him down the attic stairs, and Heron soUowed. They all emerged into the street ; and then Heron turned to Wild, and spoke calmly. \" I hesitated about taking your life in that house, because it was just possible yon spoke the truth, and had it not in your power to undo the wickedness you had done ; bnt now, if you make any attempt to bring peril upon me, that wiU be a distinct act which I will not doubt about, and you die!\" \"It is, indeed!\" replied Heron; \"and I feel that I cannot do more just now for the release of Edith and Lady Castleneau than by securing this man.\" Old Anthony drew back with a shudder, for he had almost a superstitious dread of Jonathan Wild. \"Good night!\" added Heron. \"You will see me again soon.\" \"Good night, old dot and carry one!\" said Tom. \" You will see me, too, soon I\" Tom had in the bouse succeeded in getting rid of his feminine costume, so that he was now himself again, and all ready for the road. He sprung upon his horse's back ; and then Heron, as he pointed a pistol at the head of Wild, said, \" If you do not mount at once, as sure as there is a heaven above us, I will shoot you 1\" Wild thought those words from tho lips of Felix Heron by far too solemn to be trifled with, lor treated as an idle threat; and he mounted behind Tom Ripon at once, although with rather an ill grace. \" I am your prisoner, just now !\" said WUd. Heron looked np at the gloomy pile of New- gate. \" Edith\u2014 Edith,\" he said, in low tones, . I will soon be with you!\" Then he kept close to Jonathan WUd, and led him towards Bloomsbury. \" This is folly !\" said WUd. \" Why take me away from my home in this fashion ?\" Heron made no reply. They went on until the old turreted windows of Castleneau House were visible; and then Felix Heron turned to Tom Ripon, and spoke."], [231, "EDITH HERON. 223 \" Forward lr cried Captain Heron.

Captain Heron kept a pistol in each hand, and he let the bridle fall upon the neck of Daisy, as he had often done when he wanted both his arms at liberty. CHAPTER LXXXIV. jonathan wild maklts various efforts to Escape, but meets no sympathy on the ROAD. Jonathan Wild was not disposed to be entirely an unobservant listener to what was going for ward, prisoner though he was. He called ont aloud ; and his voice, which was so peculiar, for the first time striking on the ears of Mortification, filled him with dismay. \" Help ! help I in the King's name !\" If a cannon-shot had suddenly lit among the little party, it could scarcely have produced moro commotion than did this cry from Jonathan Wild. The Reverend Mortification Ripon turned his horse's head instantly, and would have decamped with all the speed in his power, had not Tom Ripon laid hold of his bridle and stopped him. The young stranger in the cloak uttered an other exclamation, and appeared to be in a great state of excitement The foremost of the horsemen drew rein on corning close to where Heron and Tom and their prisoner were, with a suddenness that nearly flung him from the saddle. \" Yea, friends all,\" eaid this horseman, \" is this the way to Epping Forest?\u2014 for, as the Psalmist remarks, it won't do to follow one's nose entirely in the dark.\" WUd was rather pleased to see these demon strations of what h\u00bb wonld no doubt have called his popularity, and he again made the night-air echo to his brutal noise as he shouted, \" I call upon all persons to assist me in the King's name ! I am a constable and have the right to do so! Let those who refuse aid do so at their peril I I am not a man to be trifled with ! My name is WUd 1\" \" Bless us!\" cried Tom Ripon. \" It's old Mor tification.\" \" Is that possible ?\" said Heron. A smothered cry came from the horseman in the rear of Mortification and his steed. That horse man was enveloped in a large cloak, and nothing could be seen of his features. If the great thief-taker \u2014 great, at all events, in his own estimation \u2014 h <d been able to see the look of calm contempt tbat eat upon the face of Felix Heron as he thus spoke, he would not have felt quite so elated at the supposed effect of the pro nunciation of his name. \" Yea,\" added Mortification, \"I am all amaze ment ; and, as the Psalmist remarks \" \" Never mind, old boy,\" interrupted Tom, \u2014 \" never mind what the Psalmist remarks, but tell us how you and the widow got on, in Panyer Alley, Newgate Street?\" The Reverend Mortification nearly fell off his horse again, with astonishment at Tom's know ledge. \" Yea,\" he said, \" there are soothsayers, and wi'ches, and conjurors in the land ! I think you are the juvenile sinner named Tom ?\" \" Yea, I am,\" said Tom ; \" and, as the Psalmist ought to remark, if he dou't, you are the elderly sinner who calls himself my farher-in-law.\" \"Mortification Ripon.\" cried' Captain Heron, \" what do you wad at Epping Forest ?\" \" Yea, 1 seek Felix \u2014 the man called Felix Heron, who the ungodly world calleth the Earl of Whitcombe !\" There'was a complete silence for the space of aJbout one minute after Wild spoke. That silence was broken by Felix Heron. \" Does any one here present feel disposed to help Jonathan Wild?\" \" No !\" cried the young stranger in the cloak, in a short, abrupt manner. \" Yea,\" said the Roverend Mortification, \u2014 \" yea, a. the Psalmist says, let those help themselves who on ; and if they cannot, he is a fool who scalds himself with some one else's broth.\" Wild growled with rage. \" Be it eo,\" he said. \" I hardly expected that any of th,; gang of FeUx Heron, the highwayman, would \u2014 would \" \" I am he ! \" \" Oh, gracious ! Why, here is \" The horseman with the cloak made some re- Wild's words were jerked out in an odd kind of way, and Felix Heron moved with Daisy a pace or two forward to ascertain the reason. Tom Ripou was convenienily placed to giva Wild the most disagreeable and continual punches with one of his elbows that could be conceived, and in process of time those punches had had the most aggravating effect npon Jonathan. \" Let him be, Tom \u2014 let him bj,\" said Felix Heron. \" it is beneath us to subject him to small tortures.\" mark to Mortification iu a low tone, and he laughed, as he added, \" Hem ! hem ! Dear me, what was I saying? This is young Mr. Espe rance!\" \"Mr. who?\" \"Esperance! Eh? Oh! Le Bon Esperance is the yonng gentleman's name.\" \" That is a strange name,\" said Felix Heron, \" and means ' the good hope.' \" \" Eh? eh ?\" said Mortification, as he bent down in his saddle to lie. tea to something tbat the young stranger in the cloak said. \"Eh? Ob, yea, yea! Mr. E-iperance says tbat your name is equally strange, inasmuch as, verily, Felix means Happy.\" \" Then it belies its owner ; for happiness and I have been strangers to each other for long past, or for a time which has appeir.d to me an age \u2014 a long, long time.\" \"Yes; but, Captain, only think of the small affliction of being obliged to ride on the same horse with Jonathan Wild all the way to Eppina. Forest!\" \"Ah!\" said Wild; \"so that is our destina tion!\" \"Epping Forest!\" exclaimed the companion of the Reverend Mortification. \"Yea,\" said Mortification, with a Uvely tone"], [233, "227 EDITH HERON and air, \u2014 \"jea, Captain Heron, I wouid fain go wilh thee to that forest you name, seeing that Jonathan Wild has kindly offered to see me hanged at the next sessions ol the ancient Bailey.\" \" No,\" replied Heron,\u2014\" no I\" The Reverend Mortification Ripon was hastily plucked by the sleeve by the young mau iu the cloak, and a whispered conference rapidly took place. \"Hem!\" then added Mortification, \u2014 \" hem !

But there was no diffi nity in distinguishing the clear, bell-like tones of Ftlix Qerou from the harsh, grating voice of Jonathan WUd. \" Yea, then, be it so\" The Reverend Mortification dismounted, and so did Tom, but he took good care to hold Wild fast by the leg after he had got off the horse, until the Reverend Mortification had mounted. \"I protest against this!'' cried Wild \"This balf-mad preach..' has spite against me, and only want, to ride with me to do me some harm.\" \" Yta ; but, as the Psalmist says, we sho aid Lave a fellow-feeling.

Oh!\" The Reverend Morti .cation had on. spur on, and as he got comfortably into the saddle ot the horse which might be called Toai's, and on the crupper of which Wild rode, he made a plunging kick wilh the heel that carried the spur, aud caught Jona than exactly on the shin-bone with it, to his extreme horror. The young man with the c'.oak plucked the Reverend Mortification by tha fcleero again, and suggested something to him. \"Good!\" replied Mortification, \u2014 \"good! Yea, Captain Heron, I have tome claim upon Lhee.\" \"What is it?\" \" Yea, what ails thee ?\" \" A thousands maledictions on you!\" \" The same to the fiend Wild.\" \" Oh, don't ! Curses 1 Oh ! Perdition !\" Jonathan Wild had found out why it was that Mortification had a fancy for his society on heree back, and the discovery was anything but grati fying to him. Tom Ripon eagerly enough had mounted tha horse that tbe Reverend Mortification had been riding, and the young gentleman in the cloak rode forward to the side of Heron. \" I am obnoxious to tbe law and to Jonathan Wild, seeing that my whole time to-ni|_;ht hath been expended and used up in trying to rescue Edith\u2014 the Lady Edith, or Countess EJith, I ishould say \u2014 from the Jug called Stone.\" Wild ground his teeh together wilh rage. \" You ?\" cried Heron, \u2014 \"you have be^n so en gaged, Mortification?\" \" Yea.\" He spoke stiU in tbat strange, deep toned voice, which might bs natural, but which, to the ears of Felix Heron, bad a strange sound about ii, as though it were assumed. \" Sir,\" ha said, \" it is fit that I should inform you upon what grounds this assertion, that tho Reverend Mortification Ripou and myself have been endeavouring to aid the Lady Edith, is ba_ed \" \" TeU me all \u2014 oh, tell me aU ! \u2014 and rely npon my utmost gratitude.\" \" I will, sir. You are probably aware that tha Reverend Mortification was in tha custody of Jonathan Wild ; and that he, Jonathan, fu'ly intended to make him useful as a substitute for him against a murderous attack that was projected by a man named Boom.\" \"I am but partially acquainted with those fact', by the relation of some of them to me by Tom Bipon, who witnessed some soc'n peene as jou speak of while with my wife, E ' ith, at an old inn called Ihe 'Angel.' iu Fleet Market \" \" Thar was so,\" replied Mr. E p?rance, with a slight falter of the voice. \"I pray you to proceed, sir!\" added Frlix Heron. \" You know not how each word you utter tbat im any way relatej to Edith siuds a re sponsive echo io my heart 1\" \" I can guess it\" \" Ah, no ! do not think so None who have nit loved as I have loved, and then been estranged from the loved one, can feel as I feel.\" \" I, too, sir, have so loved.\" \"Yon\u2014 you?\" \"Even I.\" \" Can it be possible that any other besides my self in all the world can be so unhappy ?\" \" It is possible.\" \" I tell you what it is, father-in-law,\" said Tom, \"if you have moved so much as a little finger on b b alf of tbe Lady Edith, I will forgi re j ou aU the past, and take you into favour \" \" Yea, little boy, hoid thy peace. Children, as the Psalmist 6ays, sh3uld speak when they are spoken to, or hold their peace-\" \" Mortificatien,\" cried Htron, \" how can I know that what you are telling mo is the truth ?\" \" Yea, I have a witness.'' \" Who ? Where ?\" \"My young friend, Mr. E perance here, who was so good as to help rue.\" \" Is it so ?\" \" It is,\" said the young man in the cloak, in a depp, low voice. 11 Then welcome \u2014 a thousand welcomes to you both. Come with me to my forest home, and tht-re shall be no human heart bmeath its leafy shades that shall know any otber feeling towards you both than that of kiodness.\" A strange sound came from the lips of tbe young stranger in the cloak, bnt he passed it off in an affected cough, and th' n the Reverend Mor t fication added, \" Yea, I hav a proposal to make to my little boy, Tommy, as well as to you, Cap tain Heron.\" \" Go to the deuce !\" said Tom. \" Don't call me names, if you please !\" \" What is your proposal, Mortification ?\" \" Yea, it is that I should ride double with Jonathan Wild, and Tommy should take my horse, and that is his proposal Yours. 0 Captain Heron, is, that as we all ride to Epping Forest, you and Mr. Esperance should go a little in advance, and Usten to all that Le has to say about the"], [234, "228 _DITH HERON. inexplicable it may appear, that can ever shake my confidence in her ?' \" \"Ales! alas!\" \" Well, 6ir, we were both of ns \u2014 tbat fs. the dear partner of my life \u2014 fond of using lbose words, an\"! we believed them.\" \" I, too. used such words,\" said Heron, sadly ; \" and I, too, believed them.\" \" Well, sir, it so happened that I had a haif sister, who, I grieve to say, bad become a blot and a disgrace to all connected with her. From sonio strange perversity in nature, this sister of mioe had committed crimes, and seemed to delight iu. them ; while to me, anything that bad the remo'ewt taint of a departure from truth and probity was a horror.\" By the time the mysterious young man in the cloak had got thus far iu his story, the horses had accomplished a good half of the distance from London to Epping Forest. They had reached a valley beyond which was a steep ascent, fiom the top of which a view far over the old forest could be obtained. The necessity for allowing tbe horses to proceed at a slow pace up tbe hill made the conversation easier. The voice of Mr. Esperance still preserved its dopth of tone, but it bad sunk, apparently from deep emotion, very low ; eo that what with the cool rush of the night-air, and the tramp of the horses' feet, it was difficult for Heron to catch what he said distinctly. \" Sir,\" said Heron, \" you are but young to have bo suffered.\" \" I am, and yet I have loved even as I think yon have loved ; and, like you, it has been my hard lot to be estranged from the object of my love.\" \" A strange coincidence, sir. But \u2014 but yon will, perhaps, think me selfishly inconsiderate of your feelings, when I candidly tell you that I am on the rack of impatience to hear what you have to tell me of Edith.\" \" Oh, no, sir ; in these matters tbe heart cannet afford to look to the little courtesies of life. I will tell you. That man, so strange in his manners and demeanonr, who names himself the Rev. Mor tification Ripon, was saved from the death that Wild meant should overtake him. He found refuge in the house of an acquaintance in a court connecting Newgate Street with Paternoster Bow.\" \"Yes, yes; it is named Panyer Alley.\" \" It is. While there, by accident he discovered that your Edith, together with her aunt, the Lady Castleneau, was a prisoner of Jonathan Wild's.\" \" Yes, yes. Alas ! it was so \u2014 is so still.\" \" The wish to resaue them, and break for ever with the vUlain Wild, came over him ; and from bis knowledge of Jonathan's house, and of New gate, he was able, more than any man living, to have hopes of success.\" \" He shaU not lack reward, even though unsuc cessful.\" Captain Heron looked back, and he saw that the Rev. Mortification still held Jonathan Wild in ease custody, and that Tom Ripon wisely brought up the rear of the little patty, so that Wild bad no chince of escape, in consequence of any lack of vigilance- Mr. Esperance continued : \" It so happened, sir, that this sister of mine, of whom I speak more in sorrow than in anger, found me out alter my marriage, and I, from a natural shrinking tbat perhaps I should not have had, to allow her to come into contact with my wife, met her in private and in secrecy, and strove, by gold, to bribe her to go far away, and trouble me lo no more.\" \" Good heaven I\" cried Heron, \" how like \" \" Like what, sir?\" \" Like my own ead story.\" \"Indeed? That is very strange; but I will tell yon all. My wife, by some means, was informed that I met a female alone, and in secret ; and she thought \u2014 perhaps it was but natural she should do so\u2014 she thought that my affections had passed away from her, and were another's. Then there were demoniac tongues ready to foster the delusion which grew from a shrinking fear to a seeming certainty, and we were as strangers ; but not as strangers who had never met \u2014 alas, uo ! The wounds of the once loving hearts bled freely. I was very, very wretehed !\" \" But\u2014 but \" \" He procured my aid, and although my heart was very full of grief, I promised it to him, and did my best\" Felix Heron sighed deeply. It was only, he considered, too evident, that whatever foundation the Rev. Mortification had built his hopes of success in the release of Edith upon, had failed him. \" Sir,\" be said, \" from the bottom of my heart I thank you for what you have tried to do ; and I am not one of those who measure aU services by the success which attends upon them.\" \" Nor I, Captain Heron \u2014 nor I. But, sir, wou'd it be to you a great affliction \u2014 or rather, I may say, an infliction \u2014 to hear why it is that I am so unhappy ?\" \" No, no ! Say on, sir.\" \" I was too happy \u2014 I seemed to have bid good bye, once and for ever, to all the cares that beset hnman existence. Yes, I was too happy ; because I thought, I fondly believed, that I had the whole confidence of one who was far dearer to me than Ufe itself.\" \"Well, sir?\" \"Why \u2014 why did yon not explain? \u2014 why did you not, when you saw the mischief, the misery that was occasioned, at once put an end to it all by a candid account ?\" \" I sought to do so, but it was too late.\" \"Too late?\" Heron sighed deeply. How truly did those words from the young stranger in the cloak seem to pioture forth his own condition ! \" Yes, oh, yes ! Oh, what fearful words are those two ! What a world of pathos, of despair, of horror may they not contain ? Too late ! How simple they sound! and what a terni.lt) sig nificance may be given to them! Too late ! \u2014 too late!\" \" But as I say, I was too happy, and it conld not last A strange circumstance caused suspicion. and awakened the demon of jealousy in the heart of the one dear companion of my happy, happy home.\" \" Jealousy, say you ?\" \" Nay, it could hardly be called that since there was a seeming proof. I took to my heart and home, as a wife, one whom I loved so truly and sincerely, that I said to myself often, ' What shall happen, what ___\u2022 happen, however strange and \" What happened then ?\" \" I was very desolate.\" \" Yes, yes I And then ?\" \" I set out upon a pilgrimage. It was to seek her who was estranged from me ; and I wanted to hear her say \u2014 for there was the straoge prido"], [235, "EDITH HERON. 229 of blighted affection at my heart\u2014 I wanted to see ber, to meet her, and to hear her say, ' I want no explanation, I want no facts, bat I will be truthful still, and as ever loving till the death.' \" Captain H#ron allowed his head to droop down, until the luxuriant masses of his own hair mingled with the silken mane of his attached and gallant Daisy. \" Oh, heaven !\" he oried\u2014\" oh, grant, benefi cent heaven, that I may have the opportunity of saying such words to my Edith !\" \" And would you say them ?\" \" As heaven is my judge, I would !\" The young man in the cloak stopped his horse. A strange emotion seemed to shake him to the soul. \" Take that, and mind your own business, Tommy!\" said the Rev. Mortification, as he hit Tom a rap on the head. \" Yea, as the Psalmist, or somebody else, says \u2014 \" ' They who in others' business interpose May chance to get a bleeding\u2014' Oh, don't \u2014 don't !

Tom started, and could hardly believe the evi dence of his own senses, as he heard the tone of voice in which Heron spoke. Nothing could be so totally different from tbe manner in which now for many days he had spoken. There was a calmness, a satisfaction, a joyful intonation about his voice now, rich and musical as it always was, that took Tom quite off his guard. \" .bless us, Captain !\" he cried. \" What has happened ?\" \" It is I, Tom, who ask that !\" \" Oh, nothing \u2014 nothing ! Only my respected father-in-law hit me a topper, and so I hit him another !\" The spot on which he paused was a sweet and picturesque one. A woody space, enclosed on \u00bb-ach side by tall trees, and open to the north-east for an immense distance over wood and plain. In the far-off eastern horizon there was a faint flush ef colour. The new day was coming. CHAPTER LXXXV. FELIX HERON HAS REASON TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REV. MORTIFICATION RIPON AS A TRUE FRIEND. \"\"Sea, he did!\" Captain Heron laughed. Actually laughed aloud and gleefully ! Tom was astounded. That was the first time since they had left Whitcombe House that even the ghost of a smUe had ever crossed the face of Heron. When the young stranger named Esperance etopped his horse thus abruptly, Daisy likewise made a pause, as if sympathetically. Captain Heron looked with eyes that were damp in tears at his companion. \" Have you more to say, sir ?\" he asked, in sad accents. And now he was laughing on the high road, and Edith in Newgate, or in the cells of Jonathan Wild's house, so far as he, Tom Ripon, knew to the contrary. Mr. Esperance, with his cloak close about him, and his hat on, as usual, right down to his brows, was close behind Captain Heron. Bat if Tom Ripon was astonished, it was no thing to tbe astonishment of Jonathan Wild, who, for the first time in his Ufe, heard Felix Heron reaUy langh. WUd thought he had gone mad. \" Let me go ! \" he said. \" He wiU murder us aU presently 1\" \" Well, well, Tom,\" said Heron, \" and you, Mortification, make up yonr differences, and come along. The forest is only another two miles on, and when there we wUl make merry, and be as happy \u2014 ay, as happy as sunshine 1\" \" He is mad !\" said Tom. \" Yes.\" \" Yes, say you ?\" \" Yes.\" A bursting sob came from the throat of the roung stranger in tbe cloak. His hand nervously iiudid the gilt clasp that held that cloak about his neck. In massive folds tbe garment fell from him. The hat then was cast aside. A profusion of fair hair fell from its confinement \" Felix \u2014 Felix I \u2014 my own dear, dear Felix !\" A shriek of joy burst from the lips of Captain Heron ; for now in the young stranger he recog iiised his own Edith. \" Felix !\u2014 dear, dear Felix, I am Edith ! To your heart, my Felix! Once more those dear, dear arms about me! Felix, Felix, I am your own true, ever -loving Edith !\" Captain Heron could not speak ; he could only drop the bridle of Daisy, and, opening his arms, bold Edith to his bosom, while his tears fell like rain upon her face. \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" out of the joy of the heart the tongue waggeth.\" \" Forward !\u2014 forward 1\" added Heron ; and he was just riding off, when Tom Ripon called out '\u2022 Captain ! \u2014 Captain ! Have you forgot the Lady Edith ?'' \" Oh, never mind about her !\" repeated Heron, as with Mr. Esperance he rode hastily off. Tom rubbed his forehead, and then his nose, as he said, \" I say, father-in-law, the world was sure to come to an end some day, I suppose ?\" \" Yea, that is true.\" \" Very good ; then, it ain't far off it now, I can teU you, when Captain Heron says what he saidj ust now.\" -f '\u2022 Yea, he is right We need not trouble our selves, I am sure, any farther about the young female named Edith.\" Their sobs of joy were the only sounds that could be heard in that quiet spot for a time ; and then came the tramp of horse's feet, as the Rev. Mortification and his prisoner, Jonathan WUd, came up the hill. \" Oh !\" said Mortification. As he spoke, by a poll of the bridle, he faced the horse the other way. \" What the deuce do you mean?\" said Wild. Kick went Mortification's leg, armed with the spur on its heel. \" Murder 1\" yelled WUd. \" Whit's the row, Johnny ?\" said Tom Ripon, riding up. \"Oh, lor'! My eye! Well, that's tunny ! The Captain is mighty fond of \""], [236, "230 EDITH HERO? i As he spoke, the Rev. Mortification set his horse in motion, and went at a good pace after Heron. Tom hesitated for a little, and then he followed Ukewise ; but it was with a firm conviction in his own mind that his anxieties and misfortunes had driven Captain Heron at last quite distracted. willopeu the one to the left, which will lead you into a narrow passage with a door on its right!\" \"Yea\" \" I hop* you comprehend me ?\" \" Nothing can be c'earer. You keep continu ally going to the right and to the left untU you come to two thousand guineas.\" \" Well,\" said Wild, in a reflective tone of voice, \"I do admit it is a Uttle complex. Now if I were there \" The horse that Edith, alias Mr. Esperance, rode was a good one, aud although it could not have kept pace in a gallop with Dat-y, yet they both trotted on neck and neck at good speed towards Epping. It would be impossible to detail or report all that was said by Captain Heron to his Edith, in the next ten minutes, nor what she replied to him. They were happy words of fond affection, that gushed from ;he heart to the lips. There was a suspicion on the mind of Wild that something had taken place that bid fair to compromise him badly. What it was he, as yet, could not conceive ; and he was iu as great a state of puzzle as Tom Ripon, in regard to the altered tone of Captain Heron. He thought but lightly of the intellect of the Rev. MorliCcation, and less still of his principles ; BO Jonathan considered that there might possibly yet be time to work upon the latter, and t ff act his escape. \"Yea!\" \" I say if I were there \" \" Yea !\" \"I could take you by the hand, and in five minutes I could show you the gold I\" \" No doubt. He who hides can find. Yea, that is so.\" \" Hem !\" \" Hem 1\" \" Mortification Riuon?\" \"Jonathan WUd?\" \"Speak low.\" \" Yea, speak low.\" \" Wonld it not be worth the while, now, of jOur self and Mrs. Ripon to take such a sum as two thousand guineas, and let me go free, eh ? I am in a fin from which you, and you only just now, can extricate me. Come, now, what say you ?\" \" No 1\" If he could only do so before reaching the forest, all would be well. \" Hum I\" he said \u2014 \" hum ! Mr Mortification, it looks odd, don't it ?\" \"No? Pho, pho! Reflect !\u2014 two thousand guineas, and all in gold !\" 'Jonathan Wild?\" \"Yea!\" \" I say it looks odd.\" \" And I say yea ! What more wonld yon have, Mr. WUd ?\" \" Well, well ?\" \" If jou were to say ten thousand, yea, it won'd be all tbe same, because I would not trust you in the first instance; and yea, in the second, I ha.ve altered my p'ans, and mean to hold by tLe Captain and Edith !\" \" Oh, nothing \u2014 nothing ! Only, as I begin to see that my career is pretty nell over, I would not like to go out of the world, and leave a couple of thousand pounds to be laid hold of by the first chance person who happened to find them.\" \" Yea !\" \"Idiot! Oh!\" Th? Rev. Mortification, by his possession of the spur, always had it in his power to make an un comfortably practical reply to anything that Wild might, in the forgetfulness of the moment, say of an abusive character. \" Well, as I was saying, I have, hidden in my house, that sum.\" \" Very good.\" \" Oh, yes, Mr. Mortification, it will bs very good for him who finds the money, I should think.\" \" 7ea, keep a civU tongue in thy head, Jonathan Wild.\" \"You reject my offer ?\" \"Eutirely.\" \" Then be it so. Fools will stand in their own light, aud then complain that they cannot see !\" \" Yea I\" \"Yea, it will!\" \" Oome now, in a word, I am fain to say that in time past you have been of considerable use to me, and so has your wife, Mrs. Ripon, for which both of you have been very inadequately re warded.\" After this absolnte failure to dazzle the eyes of Mortification Kipon with the visionof twothonsand pounds, or guiueas, Jonathan WUd lapsed into a dead silence. \" Yea, that is uncommonly true.\" \" But as I have no chance of escape row from Captain Heron, and as he will in all likelihood take my life \" \u2022' It is likely \" \" Or leave me to the tender mercies of his band, who would like nothing better than to hang me up to one of the old trees in Epping Forest \" \" Yea, they would.\" \" Why, I think you may as well have the two thousand guineas, which, being all in gold, cannot be identified, and so bring any one into trouble !\" \"Yea, I quite agree with you, Jonathan Wild; and, as the Psalmist says, when people agree, yea, it is a sign that they are not of a quarrelsome dis position!\" \" Then listen to me !\" Tom Ripon, however, had managed to come sufficiently close to them to hear something of the conclusion of the little conversation. \"Johnny Wild,\" said Tom, suddenly, \"you promised that I should be hanged next session 1\" \" And I will keep my word, Tommy Ripon I\" \" You will try 1\" \" When I try, I don't faU ?\" \"That will do!\" \" What will do ?\" \" I only wanted to hear what you had to say about it, because now 1 know what to do ; and f tell you, Johnny Wild, that you shall not live till next session to carry out your threat !\" A shrieking cry from the roadside here startled both Wid and Moitisication Ripon, and made Tom's horse give a swerve that nearly threw him. In the hedge by the roadside, there appeared a strange, dusky-looking figure. A voice, which was feminine in its tones, but \" With aU my ears !\" \"If yon go into my house, aid proceed down stairs, and take tbe Sr.t turning to tbe right and the third to the left, and the second then to the right again, you will come to two doors, and you"], [237, "EDITH HERON. 231 which, at the same time, was full of throbs and anguish, called out, in menacing accents, \" Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear the hated tones of Jonathan WUd ?\" With these words, the gipsy woman made a rush into the bedge, and disuppeared amid the luxuriant vegetation that marked the spot a* one of rare natural beauty. \" Yea, yon did.\" \"No, no!\" said Wild; \"don't say so! Come on ; it is some mad woman I\" \"I know her!\" said Tom Bipon. \" She is a gipsy ; and once I saved her, just hereaway, from some dogs that a fellow had set at her ! Dou't you remember me, old Janet Hatton, for you told me that was your name ?\" \" No, no, not Janet : my name is Gaz .ell Hatton. Let me think ! Dogs \u2014 dogs ?\" \" Yes. Dsn't you recollect, you gave me a bit of your old torn cloak, tied up in an odd sort of knot and told me that if ever I wanted help from a gipsy, to show it, and, as far as life and limb went I should get it?\" At these words from Tcm Ripon, the gipsy woman darted out of the hedge, and, catchifig the bridle of his horse, she looked in his face. The dawn had now made some progress, so that she was able to see him well, and she recog nised him directly, and caught one of his hands, which she kissed enthusiastically, as she cried out, \" And that I should mistake you for Jona than WUd ! Oh, my son, forgive me ! \u2014 forgive me!\" CHAPTER LXXXVT. EDITH IS ONCE MOR\u00ab THE HAPPIEST OF THE HAPPY, AND FELIX HERON SMILES AGAIN. \"Dfarest and best\" said Felix Heron, as he and Edith plunged beneath the deep shadows of tbe old trees of Eppine Forest, \"you have not yet told me how that half-witted and most eccen tric personage, the Reverend Mortification, saved you ?\" \" A few words, my Felix, wiU teU you aU !\" \" Yes, dear one 1\" \" There is a communication between the cells sf Jonathan WUd's house and one of the gloomiest subterranean passages of Newgate.

She sprang towards him, and looked in his face. \" For that purpose, I was kept, along with my dear Aunt CastL neau, first in the attio of the next house to his own, in Newgate Street, and then re moved to the cell that immediately communicated with the underground route I have mentioned.\" \" But how did Mortification Ripon reach you, dearest ?\" She uttered a cry of recognition, and then she shuddered from head to foot as she shrank hick, sajing, \"I see it \u2014 I see it now, plainly! I thought I saw it once before, but I was not quite sure; but I see it now !\" \" Get out, witch !\" growled WUd. \" Who cares what you see ?\" \" The gallows is upoa his face !\" added the gipsy. \" Jonathan Wild, as sure as that there are seven stars in the blue heaven, equally dis tant the one from the other, and there are seventy times seven such, you wUl perish by the rope !\" \"AUe!\u2014 a lie!\" \" It appears that the house, or stall, In the mar ket, to which the secret way went is the property of some lady residing in Paayer Alley, with whom Mortification has au acquaintance ; and so by that means, be found the whole affair easy.\" Captain Heron could not but smi'e as Edith spoke of the lady in PaDyer Alley, with whom the Reverend Mortification \" had an acquaintance.\" As he so smiled, a gleam of bright waning light came through the forest trees upon his face and Edith thought he had never looked so like himself as he did at that moment, or had looked so Uke for a long time past. Tears darted to her eyes as she laid her hand upon his arm, and said, \"Felix, Felix, you are happy now ?\" \" Most happy, my own Edith !\" \" And \u2014 and \u2014 and \" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" I think nothing can be more probable ! As the Psalmist frequently remarked, what must be, is very likely to come to pass I\" \" Do you know me ?\" said the gipsy to Wild. He looked askance at her. \" Do you know me, 0 man of blood and of many crimes ?\" \"No, witch! How am I to know every gipsy that tramps the highways and byways, and makes a home on the commons ?\" \" What would you fay, E lith ? Oh ! why do yon pause in permitting all the impulses of your heart to find speech to me ?\" \" Alas ! I found that what I was about to say was scarcely fair !\" \" What is it, dearest?\" \" It was a hope that you would no longer harrass yourself about that earldom, whioh, aK though it truly and veritably belongs to you, has been nothing but a source of trouble, difficulty, and danger.\" Captain Heron sighed. \" Ah, Felix, Felix, you are still ambitious !\" \" No, no !

Again, then, did Heron reply to it by an imita tion of the caw of the common field crow ; but still he saw no one. \" You give me new joy, Felix!\" \" But tell me, dear one, what of the Lady Castle ne--u ?\" \"This is just a little suspicious, Edith,\" he said ; \" but only a little. I am not expected so soon at the forest; but I will give an intimation of my presence which none of my men will be able to mistake.\" \"She is bow doubtless at her own home, and intended to send for the young Earl of Bridge water and Coionei Treiawney to take their ad vice as regarded what 6he was to do to obtain redress for the trouble Jonathan WUd had given her.\" Heron, as he spoke, placed the smaU silver whistle, which he always had with him, to his lips and blew upon it four times in a peculiar mauner. Mingling with the sound, there a crashing movement through the thick underwood. Heron placed one hand lightly on the butt of one of his pistols ; bnt he uttered a half-shout of joy at sight of the honest countenanoe of Ogle. \" Thank heaven, Ogle, I see you once again !\" \" Captain, Captain, can this bo you ?\" \"Yes, Ogle, in flesh and blood \" \" And you have saved Edith \u2014 you have rescued her from Wild, and she is safe and well ?\" As Daisy now picked her way among the brushwood of old Epping Forest, sh9 came sud denly to a pause fronting a gigantic oak tree, and Felix Heron, whose eyes were fixed lovingly upon the face of his Edith, started, and glanced before him at the tree, as she uttered a slight exclama tion. \" What is that, Felix ? What is the meaning of that ?\" A large printed biU was fixed to the tree- Heron conld read it at a glance. The royal arms were at the top of it, and underneath that the words, \" Five Hundred Pounds Reward I\" in rather obtrusive capitals. \"How know you that Ogle?\" \" Ah, Captain ! it don't want two ears to hear it from the sound of your voice, or two eyes to see it in the look of your face \" Heron smiled. The remainder of the bill was as follows: \u2014 \" Wheroas the above reward wUl be paid to any one, and a free pardon up to the date of this document granted, for the apprehension of FeUx Heron, alias Captain Heron, alias the Earl of Whitcombe, a felon, who is accused of divers mis demeanours, larcenies, and highway robberies, as well as of high treason towards his most Gracious Majesty the King. Information to be given to Mr. Jonathan Wild, at his house in Newgate Street. God save the King !\" Heron smiled. \" I think, Ogle, that this gentleman will be able to tell you something of Edith.\" Ogle looked at the Mr- Esperance for a few seconds, and then he darted forward, and, catching hold of the bridle of the horse, he called out, ' God bless you, Lady Edith !\" Edith then dropped the cloak from about tbe lower part of her face, and held out her hand frankly to Ogle- \" And you, too, Ogle,\" she said ; \" may heaven always bless you for your devotion and attachment to my Felix.\" \" Look sharp, 0,'le !\" then said Heron. \"Tha Rev. Mortificition Ripon has done me a good ser vice, and is approaching with a prisoner on the horse behind him.\" \" A prisoner, Captain ? It's Mrs. Ripon, I sup pose ?\" \" Oh, no I a much more important person. Be hold, Ogle ! Now you see who it is.\" From amidst the trees Mortification and Tom Ripon now appeared ; and Ogle, as he clapped his hands together with satisfaction, called ont, \" It is the rascal WUd himself !\" Edith shuddered \" Nay, dearest, this is but a slip of paper, and can harm us not! Think nothing of it! It is a weak effort of the malignity of WUd ; bnt of all men, he is harmless now !\" \" Oh, Felix, Felix ! I know not what to think : but at times I fancy that if we were to go far away from England we might find the peace which is denied us here!\" \" We wiU think of that, dearest\" \"Soon\u2014 soon, Felix?\" \" Yes, dear Edith, soon, if you wish it ! But hark ! Does not that cry come with a recollection of old, pleasant days, composed of rapidly fleeting but happy hours, upon your tars?\" It was the cry of an owl. \" To whoo ! To whoo ! To whoo !\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" here we are ! This is a pleasant rural spot, but there is a something, 0 Captain Heron, since that is what the profane world nameth tbee, that I would fain say.\" \" Say it, Mortification. What is it ?\" \" Yea, my inward man calleth out and the call may be translated into the word ' Breakfast ! breakfast! \u2014 breakfast!' \" Edith smUed. Captain Heron repUed to the call, which he knew came from one of his own scouts, with a cawing sound, which was an exact imitation of a raven. \" Be assured, Mortification, that you shall not want for the best that the green shares of old Epping Forest can present to yon.\" \" Why,\" said Ogle, \" there is nothing but a couple of haunches of venison, a pasty made of nice bits from the loin, some fine old ale, the best bread that the vUlagee round abont can furnish, and fine fresh butter, together with some old eau de vie \u2014 a small cask of which we have. I rather think there are a dozen or two trout as well. But that's all !\" \" Hold !\u2014 yea, hold thy tongue 1\" cried the Rev. Mortification, as he hastily dismounted. \" Do you want to make me feel ten times more hungry than before, friend Ogle?\" 6 * Then all was still, and they rode on through the forest. It was a vexation much more than anything in the shape of an alarm for Felix Heron to find that at intervals, right through the outskirts of the wood, these bills, offering five hundred pounds re ward for him, were posted. \" Edith, dear one,\" he said, \" I cannot quite comprehend the way in which such bills as these could be posted under the very eyes of my men.\" Edith checked her horse instantly. \" Is there treachery ?\" \" I hope not\" iJaptain Heron Ukewise paused; and Daisy"], [239, "233 EDITH HERON I Ogle laughed. Captain Heron then pointed to Wild, who hav ing made some demonstration to try aud free him self from the bonds which held him, was admon ished by Tom Ripon to be quiet by a Up on the bead with the barrel of a holster pistol. Ogle,\" said Heron, \" to your care I commend that man ! Keep him in safety, as you would some savage animal not amenable to the taming hand of man !\" Ogle was by the side of Jonathan in an instant, and then he whistled twice, and from the neigh bouring brake four of Heron's men appeared. \"Secure him, and follow me!\" ordered Ogle; and although Wild made as much active resistance as he could, he was got off the horse and con ducted rapidly towards the old cavern for secu rity. . Ogle was slowly fallowed by Captain Heron and his little party, and as they went they kept seeing still more and more of the bills, stuck fast by some means upon the largest trees, offering tbat reward practically for his life. A shadow seemed to come aoross the face of Heron. It was not that he thought himseU in any dan ger, but he feared treachery. He did not think that that treachery, if it ex isted, would prove successful, but what he really dreaded was that he would be called upon to furnish it Edith saw that there was a look of trouble in his eyes. She spoke gently to him- \" Something is amiss, my Felix !\" \" I fear so, Edith !\" \" Some danger ?\" \" No, no !

It was Captain Felix Heron, and it was his noble and sagacious Daisy, that stood there in the bright moonlight, as it fell upon that fair forest glade. Motionless, for a time, as two statues, stood Captain Heron and his horse. Daisy, who, with that rare instinct she at all times possessed to 6nd out and to partake of the feelings of her master, moved not head nor foot as Heron looked around him at the bright and beautiful moonlight. have been plactd there by any but one of my own men.\" At this moment 0?le came back, and approach ing close to Heron, but not looking at him, he said in low tones, \" Don't say anything about it, Captain. I wUl tell yon presently.\" \" Is Jonathan in safety ?\" \" Oh yes, Captain ! Two of our fellows, who I know I may depend upon, are on gnard, not over him, but with him.\" \" That is well.\" The Rev. Mortification Ripon now uttered suoh a loud groan, that everybody turned round to look at him, in the fear that something serious had h<ppened to him. \" What's the matter now, father-in-law?\" asked Tom. When he spoke it was in a tone of deep emo tion. \" Amid these 'orest trees, and in the deep shadow of this old wood, a new life will com mence. Heaven, in its mercy, grant that it may be a happy one I\" What hidden meaning was there in these words of Felix Heron's ? When bis Edith presents him with her first-born they will no longer be a mys tery. \"Yea, everything; for when the inward man calleth out in audible tones the word breakfast, and the breakfast cometh not, everything is the matter.\" \" Come on, then, old Mortification,\" said Ogle. \" Come with me, and the inward man shall soon be satisfied.\" '\" Yea, I follow gladly. I sing a song of re joicing. Yea, I do.\" By way of proving his words true, the Rev. Mortification began to what he called sing, .'. bicli was so fearful a croak, that with one accord every one implored him to be silent. Captain Heron then, with Edith, rode into one of the old glades of the forest, followed by Tom Ripon, to whose oare he then consigned Daisy, while he, with Edith on his arm, so far as the width of the secret paths among the brushwood would admit of such a mode of progression, made his way towards the ruins of the old priory or abbey, whichever it had really been \u2014 there being disputes still among the learned on that point And now, with the reader's kind leave, we pass over that day at the forest, with all the remarks of the Rev. Mortification about the good things for the inward man which Ogle placed before him, and we repair to that most beautiful of alt the fair glades, which has more than once been the theatre of strange events in the wood, in order to be present at a scene of great excitement and interest CHAPTER LXXXVII. JONATHAN WILD FINDS AFFAIRS ASSUMING A VERY DANGEROUS ASPECT IN EPPUiG FOR1ST. A cloud swept over the fair face of tbe moon. Felix Heron blew a shrill call upon his whistle, and Daisy pricked up ber ears at the sound, as though she expected to start at once upon some adventure on road or heath. But such was not to be the case on that night although, soon, Captain Heron was to resume his old life, and to lead his merry men all on many a foray, as of old. The echoes of his whistle had hardly subsided, when from the leafy recesses on eaoh side of the glade there appeared his band, eagerly pressing forward to the open spac9. The hooting of owls, the cawing of rooks, and all sorts of odd cries and sounds, in imitation of the wild denizens of the forest, heralded the ap proach of the band. It was not until Heron held up his arm in the now restored moonlight, for the cloud had passed away, that they were aUent Ogle then stepped up to Daisy's bead, and while he laid his hand upon the arched neck of the gal lant creature, and while the members of the band thronged around, he spoke \" Captain, you left me in charge of the forest ; I am ready now to give an account of my trust\" \" That is well, Ogle.\" \" I hope so, Captain.\" \" My mother is better in health since her re moval from Shooters' Hill ; and in an interval when she could be free from pain and speak te. me, it was of your kindness and attention.\" Ogle bowed his head. As that day declined on which Felix Heron, with his Edith, once more fonnd their way to their sorest home, the moon had risen with unusual splendour. The broad, yellow diso shed a golden lustre over the masses of vegetation in old Epping. It was not nntil the fair luminary of the night had climbed up a good fourth of its course in the deep blue sky, that it assumed the white, sUvery hue commonly associated with it Earth's mists and vapours had, up to that period, invested the moonbeams with almost a sunny colour. Through the luxuriant autumn vegetation the bright rays glistened and shone in long shadows, making the grass on that glade look as if hung with millions of minute and glittering brilliants, for a heavy dew had fallen at sunset and each globule of moisture represented a jewel. The silence of the forest glade was for a time profound. But that did not last long. A solitary horse man gallopped out from a dense thicket of trees, and stood in bold relief in the moonlight A glance from any one who had ever looked upon that horse and that ri-ler before, would be sufficient for recognition. \" But,\" added Captain Heron \u2014 and here the reader may suppose that what Heron was about to say had been to 6ome extent so far as regarded its mat'er, pre-arranged between him aud Ogle, \" but I grieve to say that there must have been but lax watch kept in the forest\" \" Indeed, Captain ?\" \" Yes, Ogle. Tbe first thing that met my eyes at all unu ual was a biU affixed to one of my trees.\" \" A bill, Captain ?\" \"Yes. Am I not the king of Epping Forest?\" \" Assuredly, Captain.\""], [241, "EDITH HERON. 235 \" Then how is it that tree after tree\u2014 in fact \u00bb11 of the tallest and broadest growth\u2014 have had affixed to them a document aiming at roy life?\" Ogle was silent for a short space, and the band looked curiously in each other's faces. Then Ogle spoke. \" Last night, Captain, the forest was well looked over, and the scouts were placed as usual, so that no person could on any pretence make an entrance to auy of the glades without being s-en and <iues tioned.\" on guard, when I heard voices ; and creeping on through the thickets, I found that it was WUd and Number Thirteen, talking together.\" \"False! false!\" oried Thirteen. \"I did not speak to him one word 1\" \" Go on, Number Two,\" said Heron. \" I heard Wild say to him that he had better make the best of his way to London, and give information of what had happened, and I further heard him say something elae.\" \"Speak freely!\" \" It's all a lie !\" cried Thirteen. \" That man owes me a grudge !\" \" Well, and yet \" \" And yet Captain, by the earliest light of this morning, fifty of those bills were posted on, as you say, some of the principal trees of the wood !\" \" By whom ?\" \" That, Captain, I know not \" \"By whom?\" again asked Heron; and this time he ran his eyes over the band. No one replied. \" How many should we be ?\" atked Heron. \" Fourteen, Captain.\" \"Count!\" \" I heard Wild further say to him that he had posted the bills well.\" \" Is that all ?\" \" That is all, Captain !\" \" Thirteen, what have you to say to this, and what reason can yon give why we should not hang you on one of these trees?\" \"Hang me?\" \" I said 'hang!'\" \" Then the only reason is, that it is aU false. My word is as good as hi\u00bb, and no man should be hung on the testimony of a single witness.\" \" There is reason iu that!\" Ogle counted thehoads; there were but thirteen persons present \"Who is absent?\" \" Number Thirteen, Captain.\" \" Summon him.\" \" Ha, ha ! Of course there is ! Now, Number Two, how do you feel now the Captain acquits me?\" A strange sound rang through the forest It was a light succession of taps npon the strained parchment of a tambourine from which the jing ling scales had been taken. But no Number Thirteen appeared. \" Proclaim him !\" said Heron. \" I shall do so, most assuredly,\" said Heron. \" Hurrah !\" \" Stop, Thirteen, and don't make so much noise. I shall acquit you, unless there is some fair corroboration oi this report from Number Two.\" \" Number Thirteen, appear, on pain of death !\" cried Ogle. A single figure made a sudden rush from one side of the glade to the other, but aVout the middle of it the figure rolled over iu the most eccentrio manner, and fell half stunned to the green-sward. \" Who is that?\" asked Heron. Thirteen looked anxious. Heron spoke again. \" Oan any one give any evidence on this matter?\" \" Yes,\" said 0 .le ; \" I can !\" Thirtee n made a haU rush to escape, but he was caught instantly. \"I followed Number Two,\" said Ogle, \"and unknown to him, overheard all that he overheard, and I depose to the same facts.\" \" And I,\" said Tom Ripon, \" pegged down a stout cord on the glade after we had all assembled here, over which Number Thirteen, as you all saw, rolled. ' Number Thirteen looked amazed. In the moonbeams it could be seen that his face had assumed a livid expression. Ogle and a couple of the band made a dash for ward, and caught the single figure as it ros\u00b0 to its feet and was on the point of trying to make an escape amoDg the thick underwood that fringed the glade, and j. iced some of the trees together in quite an impenetrable manner. The fugitive was brought within the circle of bright moonlight \" What manner of man is this ?\" \" Number Thirteen,\" replied Ogle. \" Yes,\" said the man, \" I am Number Thir teen, Captain, and ready for any duty.\" \" That is well. Ogle, what duty has this man been upon ?\" \" He was, two hours since, placed as a senti nel over Jonathan Wild.\" \" Was he duly relieved?\" \" No, Captain !\" \" Then he has left his post ?\" \" Not exactly so, Captain, for I told him tbat when he beard the summons to the glade, he might come. The prisoner is so well secured, that escape, in many forms, would be impossible, and in one, it need not be thought of.\" \" Yes,\" said Number Thirteen. \" Yes, I am here, acoording to orders.\" \" And that is all ?\" said Heron. Captain Heron regarded him a few moments in silouca, and then he said, \" What have I done to you that you should seek to betray me?\" \" Murder ! murder ! murder !\" yelled Number Thirteen, in the vain hope that some help might come to him iu the wood. \" Too much noise!\" sa;d Heron, quietly. The traitor was gagged with a cork and a bit of twine in a moment \" Bring Jonathan Wild here !\" said Heron. A few minutes sufficed to introduoii Jonathan to the moonlight party in the forest glade. Captain Heron looked at him fixedly, and spoke. \"Jonathan Wild, for a long time past you have striven to take my lif., and I forgave you, because, despite all your machinations, I still lived to do so. But of late you have adopted a now course of action, which is to endeavour, by out rages against one who is dearer to me than life itself, to bring me to what you call your terms!\" \" I have a right,\" growled WUd, \" to oompagj \" No, Captain !\" said a voice. \" Step forward ! Who are you I\" \" Number Two!\" \" Speak, then I\" \" I was passing close to the entrance of tha old cave by the spring head, where Jonathan Wild is a prisoner, aud where Number Thirteen was"], [242, "EDITH HERON. 236 \u00bb Wretch I\" cried Wild. \" Beast !\" my ends in the best manner I can see open to me.\" \" It is, Captain, that you will, on condition that Thirteen aots as executioner to Wild, let him e\u00b0z\" \" Very well ! By the same reasoning, I, too, have a right to get rid of one so absolutely ob noxious as you are ! Ogle, to you and to the band I commit this man I Do to him what seems to you all best! I never want to look at his face again !\" \" So,\" said Wild, \" that's a polite way of hand ing me over to these fellows to be murdered !\" Ogle placed his hand on Wild's collar. \" Away with him !\" \" Well, Felix Heron !\" added Jonathan, with an effort at bravado that each moment was be coming more difficult \u2014 \"all I can say is, that if I had hanged you it would have been only in the regular way at Tyburn, after giving you a ride in the cart down Holborn Hill and up the Oxford Road!\" \" I agree !\" \" Number Thirteen, wiU yon hang Jonathan Wild ?\" \" With pleasure !\" Wild uttered a yelL \" Villain !\" he said. \" Is this what I gave you twenty guineas for, and a promise of future favours ? If there's a wretch in all the world, his name is Jackaon ; and that is you !\" \" Away with them !\" said Heron ; \" and now let all but the scouts seek repose ! Ogle, and you, Tom Ripon, come with me ; for I have work that may employ you both !\" The band dispersed ; and Jonathan Wild was again consigned to the cave, while Number Thir teen was placed in one of the secure chambers of the old ruin. Tom Ripon and Ogle remained with Captain Heron ; and when they were all three alone, Heron said, \" I want money, and must have it ! Fate makes me what I am \u2014 a high waj man ! I propose that we make a little excursion on the road to night !\" \" A bargain, Jonathan\u2014 a bargain !\" cried 0;>!e. \" What do you mean ?\" \" That I will make a bargain with you to this effect \u2014 that I will have no hand in your hanging, except it be done in the regular way at Tyburn Tree!\" \"Done!\" Tom Ripon raised a shoot of pleasure at the proposition. Ogle took it more calmly; merely saving, in quite a business-like way, \" Shall I look to your pistols, Captain?\" \" ThaLk you, no ! All is well ! I have an idea that we shall fiod something worth tbe stopping on the Great North Road ! The evening is yet young, and we have plenty of time to take a little gallop across the country I Forward \u2014 forward I\" Captain Heron, and Ogle, and Tom Ripon left the old forest at a hand- gallop and made their way, by various roads and woody lanes, to what was then named the Great North Road, which was one of the least frequented, at that time, in the neighbourhood of London. \" Done be it!\" \" Friends all !\" cried Ogle to the band, \" join ma in asking the Captain tor leave of absence to morrow till the afternoon.\" \" To-morrow is Sunday !\" said one. \" Ah. eo it is I Then the next day will do better !\" \" And the moon,\" said Tom Ripon, \" will be then quite ten days old!\" Wild started. \" Take the leave you want,\" said Captain Heron- \" I will not ask you what your project is, O^le, for I know I can trust all my men to your discretion, and that whatever b^ld act you contem plate, you will bring them off in safety.\" \" Depend upon that, Captain ! And now, Jona than WUd, take notice! You will be h ange. d at Tyburn on Monday next, at one o'clock \u2014 and the Lord have mercy on your soul !\" \" Amen!\" said a loud nasal voice; \"and the Rev Mortification Ripon dropped from a tree, to the great amusement of the band. \" You are all of you mad, I think!\" said Wild ; \" bnt the hernp is net knotted or spun that will choke me yet !\" \" I am of a different opinion,\" said Ogle; \" and think it is ! There will only be one difficulty ; and that is in regard to who will do the job for yon, Jonathan WUd 1\" \" Ah !\" That one cloud, which had for a few brief minutes swept over the moon when Heron and his band were assembled on the glade at Epping For.=st, was but the precursor of many others. By the time the little party of three stood upon the North Road, on the slope of a hill, tbe evening hail become rather an uncertain one as regards light \u2014 for, although the moon was still high up iu the sky, it was more often than not obscured by sendoing clouds. \" It's quite a highwayman's night, Captain !\" remarked Ogle. \" It is, indeed !\" \" Good luck to ns!\" said Tom. \" Somebody is coming!\" At a rapid pace, a horseman approached, with a valise strapped behind him on the horse's back. \" It is but a youth,\" said Heron. \" That's all, Captain!\" remarked Ogle. \" Oh, Captain 1\" said Tom, quite out of breath with excitement; \" do\u2014 oh, do ! \u2014 do \" \"Do what, Tom?\" \" Let me stop him ! Let me do it all myself, Captain! He is only a little one ; bnt there must be something in that little bit of a trnnk, or port manteau, he has behind ; and I want to take it ' May I, Captain ?\" \"Go, then !\" Wild looked about him, but no one spoke. \" Still, tbat may be got over,\" added Ogle. \" Come now, Mr. Mortification, what do you say ? Will you officiate for your old friend Jonathan Wild, at Tyburn ?\" \" Nay, not I ; but I will give him religious con solation in the cart as he goes along \u2014 yea, wUl I ! I will sing him the psalm beginning with \" ' We go unto the brimstone la.e.' \" Wild gnashed his teeth with rage. \" Then,\" said Ogle, \" there is but one resource. Captain, I have a request to make to you ; and it is, tbat you will let Number Thirteen go free, on one condition.\" Tom trotted out into the middle of the road, and began whistling. Tbe horseman came up rather quickly, con sidariug that it was a hill-side. \" What condition ?\" \" Name it I \u2014 oh, name it, Ogle !\" shouted Num ber Thirteen. \" Name it ; and I, for one, let it be .that it may, agree to it beforehand !\""], [243, "EDITH HERON. 237 I \" Sir,\" said Tom, \"you will wind your horse!\" \" What's that to you?\" was the response. \" Oh, lots, lots ! Stand and deliver !\" Tom drew a pistol, and held it at the head of the traveller, who ou the instant took from his pocket what seemed another, and there ensued a report ; and Tom felt himself hit in the eye, and covered as he thought, with blood. \" Take that !\" said the horseman with the valise. \" The very same, Captain ; but Jaok, it was not at all kind of you to put a bullet into my nob.\" \" I haven't !\" \"But I feel it there now!\" \"No, yon don't There was a buUet in the pistol ; but I left it on the road, at the other side of Finchtey Common, and only shot you wi.h the powder.\" Tom was silent; but he still Bhook his head doubtingly, for he could not quite convince him self that a ballet was not actually lodged within it Tom's pistol only flashed in the pan; and he dropped it, as he held his horse by both hands in tbe mane, and cried out \" Captain, I'm done for !\" \" Serve you right !\" said the horseman with the valise. \" And so,\" said Ogle, \" you have taken to the road, Jack Sheppard?\" \u00ab Not 1 1\" Tom Ripon fairly staggered on the saddle, but be did not actually fall The feelings of Captain Heron, at the supposition that Tom was kiUed or badly hurt may be easier imagined than described. To rush forward, and lay his hand upon the horseman's bridle, was the work of a moment Heron's eyes seemed to flash fire, then, as he called ont \" Ogle, look to Tom ! I will soon avenge him npon this hasty and most Ul-advised person.\" Ogle flung an arm round Tom Ripon. \" But it looks Uke it\" \" So it may \u2014 so it may ! It is my first and last try at it I shaU stick to my own proper business of \u00bb oracksman, after this. But the fact is, I have been so dunned by all sorts of highflyers talking about Ufe on the road, that I thought I would see what it was like.\" \" Then you have been crying ' Stand and de- Uver ?' \" \" Oh, yes, I have ; but I can't just yet make out the sort of adventure I have had.\" \"What do you mean, Jack?\" asked Heron. \" Ride along with us, and say what you mean.\" \" I will.\" CHAPTER LXXXVIII. Jack Sheppard moved his horse to the side o\\ Heron; and while Tom Ripon strove to wipo the stains of gunpowder from his face, he spoke, iu that careless way that was habitual to him. \" Well, as I was saying, I was almost persuaded that there was nothing like a life on the road ; so I borrowed this horse, that I saw waiting for somebody at the corner of PaU Mall.\" Heron laughed. How light-hearted was Felix Heron, now that he knew his Edith was safe amid the intricate mazes of old Epping Forest ! TOM RIPON AOAIN TRIES LIFE ON THE ROAD, AND IS ASTONISHED AND ALARMED. The young man on the horse, with the valise behind him, looked as calm and as cool as pos sible In reply to the angry words of Captain Heron, he only calmly whistled ; but it was no common whistling that broke the stillness of the night-air. It was more Uke some exquisitely-played fla geolet Tom Ripon shook his head. \" HiUoa ! hilloa !\" he said. \u25a0 What has hap pened, eh?\" \u2022' Tom ! Tom !\" cried Ogle. \" Speak again, and we shall begin to think you are not hurt !\" \u2022' Hurt ? Who said 1 was hurt ?\" \" It's a good horse, Tom. I can tell that by the way in which Daisy seems inclined to make it's acquaintance.\" \" On, yes ! I daresay it's a good horse. When you are borrowing anything of this sort it is just as well to get a good article, only it's a bother to be tumbling off, sometimes.\" \"You don't mean to say you do that, Jack?\" cried Tom Ripon. \" Yes, now and then.\" \" You are no rider?\" \" We thought yonr brains were blown out !\" \" Oh, stuff ! I'm none the worse. I don't know what all the fuss is about\" Tom kept shaking his head, and the cool, calm horseman, who had fired the pistol in his face, continued whistling. Captain Heron and Ogle were both puzzled to know what to make of the whole affair. \" Not much. It is not in my line ; and yet it's a wonder I don't ride well, for my mother's grand father was a dragoon !\" \" A good and sufficient reason. Jack !\" said Heron. \" But tell us what success you have had.\" \" Too much.\" \" If you have really,\" laid Heron to the strange horseman, \" taken the life you aimed at, your own is justly forfeited.\" The young horseman ceased whistling. \" I don't know that Captain Heron,\" he said. \" So you know me ?\" \" To be sure, I do !\" \"Hoorah!\" shouted Tom \u2014 \"hoorah! I don't mind, now, if there is a bullet in my brains. It miy stay there, and welcome, for all I care.\" \" Are you mad, Tom?\" cried Ogle. \" Not a bit of it 1 I thought there was only one person I knew who could whistle like that, and I am not mistaken. You are my old acquaintance, Jack Sheppard 1\" \" To be Btue, I am I\" replied the young horse man. \" Too much ! That is odd.\" \" It may be, Captain Heron. I did think to stop some people with tin in their pockets \u2014 I should not have minded a lord or two, or, perhaps, one of the royal family ; but when yon come to kings and ghosts, it's quite another affair.\" \" Kings and ghosts, Jack ?\" \" Yes ; listen, and I will tell you all about it The moon was up awhile ago, aud I had just got out of a lane by the high road, when what should I see bnt a covered cart coming along, driven by a boy, who sat sideways on the horse, and seemed to be half asleep. What made me rather look at him was that he had an odd-looking cap on his head, with what seemed to me no end of diamonds. on the front of it I called out to him to stop, and he did so ; then I just put a pistol to his head, and, \" Jack Sheppard !\" said Heron. \" Is this the same Jack Sheppard of whom I have so often heard yon speak, Tom?\""], [244, "238 EOITH HltKOK \" 1 do know it is, too well ; and if I tiud it is a way you go on with, I wiU take good care to make you remember it !\" These two crowned heads were evidently quar roUing. asked him who and what he wad, and what he had ill th* covered cart.\" \" Web, Jack, what then ?\" sail Ogle. \" You wouldn't guess, if you weio to try for a hundred years.\" \" I won't try then.\" \" TeU me, Jack,\" said Heron. \"Well Ou, look\u2014 look! There they come ! That's the very CJVered cart, and there is the boy with the hat and the diamonds ! Look \u2014 look I All I can tell you just now is that there's a king inside the cart, with a gold crown on his head !\" \" A capital bit of booty,\" said Heron, as with two bounds he brought Daisy t<\u00bb the side of a covered cart, which looked like a juvenile waggon, and whioh, at that monent made its appearance slowly over the brow of the hill. Ogle, and Tom Ripon, and Jack Sheppard crept back, for they all felt that Captain Heron was quite equal to the adventure alone, be it what it might \"Haiti\" he cried; and the boy who sat in feminine fashion on the horse tt_at drew the covered cart, stopped at once, calling out, as he did so, \"Oh, Lord! here's another of them. The road is beset by highwaymen.\" Captain Heron looked the boy in the face, as he said, calmly, \" If you attempt to move on I will shoot you I\" \" Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear ! I won't \u2014 I won't ! Don't, Mr. Highwayman \u2014 don't I It's no use stopping me, indeed it is not Eighteen pence is all you will get if you rob ns all round.\" In strange contradiction to this assertion of poverty on the part of the boy, there was now pro jected from the covered cart a head. It was a female head. A third voice now joined the tumult from the interior of the covered oart \"Lat me get out! Let me get out! I don't want to he scratched in tha dark here by mistake !\" \" Put down your vizor, 0 ghost!\" said another voice. \" I will. Come, fair one, let us alight, and ste what is the tumult now.\" The canvass of the covered cart was violently agitated at on<s part, and to the dismay of Dai_,y, who had never seen such a spectacle, and some what to the eurprUe of Heron himself, there alighted from the cart a man ia complete armour. A suit of plate mail clothed him from head to foot ; ai d he wore in his helmet, the vizor of which was down, a plume of raven black feathers. This knight, armed so cap-a-pie, handed from the cjvered cart a fair and gentle-looking youug lady, a'tired in white satin, aud with a chaplet of fair flowers round her head. As fate would have it the moon at that moment shone out from among the night-clouds, casting a broad beam of soft, silvery light upon the armed man and the fair young lady in white satin. \" Who and what are you ?\" cried Heron. \" Speak and declare yourselves, if you be mortall\" The young lady replied to him, in a rich, musical voice: \u2014 \"'To-morrsiw is St Valentine's Day, All iu the mornlog betime, Anrt I. a maid, at your window, To be your Valentine.' '* But it was not the head as a head that attracted the attention of Captain Heron, and so practically contradicted what the boy who sat on the horse had said of the poverty of the party. It was how that head was adorned. A light burst npon the imagination of Felix Heron. \" Ah !\" he cried. \" Do I guess right ? \u2014 are you the fair Op'ielia ?\" \" I am, sir.\" A rich and costly diadem was upon the regal looking brows. The diadem glittered with tbe rarest gems, in the centre of which appeared one single ruby of most extraordinary beauty and magnificence. \" And you the murdered Majesty of Denmark?\" \" 'I do revisit the glimpses of the pale moon,' \" said the man in the suit of mail, \" ' to seek ven geance for my foul and most unnatural murder.' \" \" And I am tbe bad King,\" said the regal looking person -ge. u And I Gt-rtrude, the Queen,\" cried the lady with the diadem, \" who killed a king, to marry with his brother.\" Captain Heron was astonished. But he was still more astonished when the wearer of this right regal diadem called out, in a shrill voice, \"God gracions, TUley, whatever is the ma'ter now ?\" \" And I,\" said a voice that had not hitherto spoken, from the interior of the coveed cart \u2014 \" I am Haml-t the Dane.\" Even Daisy swerved a little at sight of such maguificence, and Captain Heron, by an involun tary movement galloped round to the other side of tbe covered cart \" All of which means,\" slid Heron, with a lau^h, \" that vou are a theatrical troop ?\" \" Just so !\" There he met with a second surprise, which was certainly not in the least inferior to the first. Another head was projected from an opening in the canvass, which was to the full as richly and as gorgeously attired a9 the other one. But this head was most decidedly masculine. It wore a kingly crown, of such glitter and magnificence, that even the diadem of the feminine head paled in contrast to it A p Ttion, too, of a robe of crimson velve', that seemed to be edged with cootly ermine, was sligh'ly visible. \" TU1>, Tilly, my dear,\" said the bearer of the kingly crown, \u2014 \" what is it ?\" \" You might ask her what it was,\" screamed the shrill voice of tbe woman of the diadem, \"without adding ' my dear' to it ?\" \" On, you know,'' said the King, \" that is only my way.\" \" Tom ! Tom !\" \" Yes, Captain !\" \" Come here; and you, too, O^le.\" Tom R'poa and Ogle trotted up, closely followed by Jack Sheppard; but when Tom saw the armed spirit of the murdered father of Haml-st, he kept at a wary distano from it - \"C.ptain! Captain!\" be cried. \" Let's be off! Take the King's crown, and be satisfied!\" \" Why, Tom, have yon never be en to the play ?\" \" The\u2014 the play ? What, Captain ? Is this a sort of a play ?\" \" Yes, Tom.\" Tne youug lady in the white satin and the chaplet of flowers darted up to Tom, and caught him by the hand, as she sang: \u2014 \" 'They bore him, bare-faced, on his bier, With a heigho 1 heigho! '\""], [245, "EDITH HERON. 239 \"Hilloa! Don't!\" cried Tom \u2014 \"don't miss I I say, Captain, it strikes me this young lady has left her wits at home !\" posed upon by the fair Ophelia, who had as much alarmed as she had pleased hirn. \" Captain,\" said Tom, \" there is luck, you know, in the number three ; and as the next ad venture we have to-night will be that number, why, I think it ought s:ill to be left to me.\" \" So be it Tom.\" \" And here it comes,\" said Ogle. \"Where? where?\" Heron laughed. \" No, no, Tom ! These are harmless people. My only wonder is, that they find any amusement or enjoyment in these tinsel trappings off the stage.\" \" Bless you, sir, or Mr. Highwayman, if you are one,\" said tha ghost in the plate armour, \" we don't; but we have been playing at aa abominable place named Wold in the Water, and all we had \u2014 in pit boxes, and gallery \u2014 was three-and-six pence; whereupon the obscure and mercenary ci izen who keeps the Sir Somebody's Head, in the aforesaid Wold in the Water, seized upon all our goods and habUiments, except what we actually wore ; and, as we were all dressed for Hamlet, \"we were compelled to come away as we were. That is Miss Tilly ClairvUle on the horse : she is dressed for young Osrick.\" \" There !\" cried Tom. \" It's all a take in, Cap tain !\" \" A post-chaise has just got to the top of the hill. The post -hoy is gritting down to put. the skid on the wheel. Dou't you see him, Tom?\" \"Idol I do! Wish me good luck, Cap'ain. I'm off.\" Without wailing for a word from Captain Heron, which he was, perhaps, afraid might be something o'ojecting to what he was about, Tom put his horse to a trot and dashed up to tbe post cbaise. Tbe post-boy had jus4 put the drag on one of the wheels, and had got iuto tha saddle again, when Tom Ripon shouted, \"Stand! On your life, post-boy, stand ; unless you want a brace of bullets through yonr head !\" \"Good Lord! a highwayman!\" cried the post boy. Tom Ripon was resolved to do things with a high hand this time ; and he was at the door of tha chaise in a moment. He dashed down tha window, and resting the pistol on the ledge, he Bhouted, \" Your money, watches, aud jewellery, or this is your last moment, by George !\" There was no reply. Tom thrust his head into the post-chaise. It was empty. \" Hoy I hilloa ! postilion ! Where \u2014 what \u2014 have you nobody here ?\" \" Not as I knows on, sir.\" \"Confound yen I\" \"Yes, sir!\" \" You are a fool !\" \" AH the world's a do P said the ghost, \" and men and women only cheats !\" \" Shall we go on, Mr. Buggins,\" screamed young Osrick from tbe horse's baett. \" Yes, Tilly, my dear !\" \" Will you,\" yelled Queen Gertrude, as she dealt Hamlet's uncle a sound box ou the ear, \u2014 \" will you go on with your ' my dearing' to that little hnssey !\" \" Come, come,\" said Heron ; \" let peace reign in the Court of Denmark for once in a way. I am quite sure this Uttle adventure has been to me aud to my fii\"ntls ' as good as a play,' as the saying is; and, therefore, your Majesty of Denmark \u2014 U you are the manager \" \" I am, sir.\" \" Then, I was going to say, I am qnite sure you will permit me to pay as for a private box.\" To the grati Sea tion and surprise of the manager. Felix Heron placed in his hand some half-dozen guineas, which, in all probability, was a much larger sum than the theatrical treasury had seen for many a day. A chorus of thanks ensued, and Ophelia ac tually kissed Tom R'pon, who cried out \" Don't hurry, Captain. I like it now !\" But of all things in the world that Felix Heron was ever ready to fly from, none had such a re pelling influence npon him as thanks- He made a half gallop of it from the spot of the adventure with the theatrical court and Tom and Ogle followed him. \" Always were, sir. Anything you please, sir. At your service, sir.\" Tom's disappointment was great, and he felt half inclined to avenge himself on the postilion by cutting the horses' traces, and leaving the stupid, empty chaise in the road. But a second thought was sufficient to dissipate all such ideas, and Tom was hurrying away to join Captain Heron when he heard the rapid sounds of horse's feet approach ing. All he did, therefore, was to get into the deep shadow of the hedgerow, and then he waited until a man on horseback galloped up to the chaise, and, pulling rein, he stopped abruptly, as he caUed out, \" Is that you, Simms ?\" \" Yes. sir,\" replied the postilion. \" Confound you, then, you should not have driven so far. I told you not to go beyond the sixth milestone.\" Jack Sheppard kept their company, and the brow of the hill soon hid from their sight the half kind of waggon in which were their Majesties of Denmark. \" I couldn't see it, sir, it was so dark ; but there's danger on the road, sir.\" \u00bb What danger?\" \" Highwaymen !\" \" Oh, s'uff ! I should like to see the highway man who would stand before a resolute man, with arms in his hands. Pull up here ! The Colonel is close at hand, with Marian.

In fact, he felt that he had not been at all for tunate on that morning. First, he bad attacked his old acquaintance, Jack Sheppard, and had thought himself shot; and, secondly, he had actually, for a time, been im-"], [246, "EDITH HERON. 240 bandage about her mouth, she had hitherto been prevented from speaking or uttering any cry of alarm. Tom felt, however, that the cry she had now uttered could not faU to reach the ears of Capiain Heron ; and, in that case, nothing further would be needed to ensure the most rapid and practical interference. \" Ah, that's it I see I can rely upon you. Now, be steady, and the twenty gnineas wUl grow into a few more.\" \u2022' All's right, sir I\" The horseman turned his horse's head, and rode back again on the route he had come. Tom Ripon, as he listened to tbis little dialogue, felt certain tbat there was some villany afloat, but what it was he was at a loss to conceive- The only question, however, in his mind, was whether he should, or should not, seize the oppor tunity that was afforded to him, of acquainting Captain Heron with what he had heard. In a few seconds Tom decided that he would do eo, and dismounting from his horse in the sha dowy spot where he was hidden, he led it by the bridle down the hiU towards where he had left Heron, Ogle, and Jack Sheppard. The personage who was called \" my lord \" com menced abusing the man who had the lady in the riding-habit at a fearful rate, for allowing her breath sufficient to utter that alarming cry. \" Who knows,\" he concluded by saying, \" but that now we shall have some troublesome person interfering with us, who we may not be able to get rid of ?\" \" Yes,\" said the post-boy ; \" and there s no end of highwaymen on the road, too \" \"In with her! \u2014 in with her, then, you idiot! Am I to run any risks in such a oase ? In with her to the chaise, and let us be off!\" \" Will you get in first, my lord ?\" said the man with the lady, and who seemed to have succeeded in replaoing the bandage about her mouth, tba removal of which had enabled her to cry out so shrUly. Tom came so stealthily upon them, that they did not hear him untU he was close to them, and spoke. \" Captain ! Captain !\" \" Ah, Tom I What is it ?\" \"\" I don't know ; but I did not feel as if I enght to try to do what may have to be done, all by myself.\" Tom then related to Heron aU that he had over beard, and was much praised by Heron for his discretion. \" Yes, yes !\u2014 I will I Ah ! oh !\" \" What's the matter, my lord ?\" There was a moment or two of silence, during \" I tell you what I can do further in the matter, Captain,\" then said Tom. \" If Ogle or Jack here will mind my horse, I wiU get up behind, or on to the roof of the post-chaise, and soon know all about it.\" \" Do so, Tom.

He was only just in time, for as he reached it, he heard horsemen coming towards it at a great pace. which \" my lord \" did not reply ; and then he \u25a0aid, sharply, \" Nothing \u2014 nothing 1 Hand her iu at once ! There is no time for delays 1\" The lady with the riding-habit was thrust, rather roughly, into the post-chaise. \" There she is, my lord,\" said the man on horseback. \" I wUl ride on before, if. you please, and if any one shaU attempt to interfere, he wiU get a bullet for his pains.\" Bang went a pistol-shot at this moment The man on the horse, and who likewise now had the charge of \" my lord's\" horse by the bridle, uttered a yell, and fell half over from his saddle towards the road. \" I rather think I had you there, my fine fel low,\" cried Tom Ripon, as he now darted out from under the chaise. \" A good shot, Tom,\" said Captain Heron. But where does the reader think that Cap'ain Heron's voice came from, of all places in tbe world ? Tom was pretty oertain he would be seen if he got behind the chaise just then, so he crawled under it Tom was not slew to perceive that there were two mounted men rapidly nearing the post chaise. Why, from the interior of the post-chaise. How he came there is easily explained. When the lady in the riding-habit had uttered the scream for help, Captain Heron at once felt the necessity of interfering in her service. He dismounted, as he was very much inclined to do, when he could, just for fear some stray shot should do an injury to Daisy, and making his way forward along the shadowy hedgerow to the chaise, he had managed adroitly to get into it on that _ide, while the post-boy was all eyes and ears to what was going on abont the lady in the riding-habit Tom Ripon, from under the chaise, saw Heron capitally, and felt that all was safe ; but he did not like the idea of the man who had behaved so brutally to the lady getting off so easily, so he crept ont close to the front wheels of the chaise and fired the pistol-shot at him that brought him down. One of them rode double \u2014 that is to say, he had some one on the saddle before him; and, by the long trail of the garm.nts, it was evident that that some one was a female in a riding-habit Whether or not this female came on the expe dition that seemed to be on foot of her own tree will or not, Tom Ripon had co opportunity ju6t then of discovering, for she spoke not a word. It was, however, not difficult soon to discover the real truth, with sufficient clearness to report to Captain Heron on the subject \" My lord,\" said the mounted man to the other horseman, with a tone of deferential respect \u2014 \" my lord, I would advise tbat the lady have a little air\" \" Give her some, but with discretion,\" was the Ogle and Jack Sheppard galloped forward. Captain Heron had got into the poat-ohaUe just before \" my lord,\" and, as the latter stepped into the vehicle, Heron had caught him by the throat as U a vice had hold of him. reply. A shrill scream then awakened every echo, far and near. It was quite evident now to Tom Ripon that the lady in the riding-habit was not only there against her will, but that most probably, by some \" My lord\" could not speak a word, and it was"], [247, "EDITH HERON. 211 friend the yonng Earl of Bridgewater's wife, and in the my lord whom he had captured, no other than Lord Clackington.

That was the voice of the young Coun tess of Bridgewater; and well did Felix Heron know that it was by the name of Henry she was in the habit of addressing her husband. \" Banish all fears,\" he said, hastily ; \" and be lieve me, Countess, that you are safe I\" If th. youug Countess of Bridgewater's voice struck familiarly upon the ears of Captain Heron, his now came upon her apprehension with a per fect remembrance of who and what he was. \" One moment,\" said Captain Heron. \" I must now hear under what circumstances this heavy headed villain had you a prisoner, Countess ?\" \" My hnsband is at his country seat, called The Elms, near to Finchley, and I was riding frora London, where I had been in attendance upon the Queen, when I was suddenly attacked at the corner of a shady lane, and taken prisoner.

With almost a chUdish cry of delight she spoke. \"The Earl of Whitcombe here! Oh! then I am, indeed, saved !\" \" You are in perfect safety, Lady Bridgewater. But by what chance I have found you in any danger, puzzles me amazingly.\" \" That man\u2014 Lord Clackington !\" \"Ah!\" \" You are perhaps aware, dear Lady Bridgewater, that I have left London, where, haviDg but one friend, and that one your husband, I felt I could only stay to embarrass him in his generous and noble efforts to be of use to me.\" . \" Yes ; he told me you were et the castle on Shooter's Hill.\" Felix Heron had been by far too much occupied with the Countess to pay any attention to the ter rified figure that was crouched up in the further corner of the coach. Now, however, he turned to him, \" Wretch ! Cannot you be satisfied by making war in your own sneaking and infamous fashion against a man, but you must pursue a lady with your persecutions ?\" \"I\u2014 I Ob, dear, me! I\u2014 I -Thieves! thieves !\" \" I was there ; but now I reside with my Edith at \" \" Hush \u2014 oh, hush !

My dear sir, I \u2014 I don't \u2014 indeed, I woKt! Only get out of my way, and you may have the lady to yourself as soen as you like !\" \" Villain !

I am a nobleman, and I oan tell yon that I stand high in his Majesty's favour ; so that you had far better do my bidding than oppose it!\" It was quite evident that my Lord Clackington had been too far gone with fright to hear the exclamations from the young Countess of Bridge water, which had embodied the name of Whit- Loud cries and shoots, and the cracking of a whip at this moment put an end to the eonversa tion between Heron and Lady Bridgewater. The cries came from Lord Clackington, who found that he had fallen into the hands of an in genious tormentor in the person of Ogle. Bearing in mind that Oaptain Heron wanted Lord Clackington to go to town safely but un comfortably, Ogle Dethought him of a plan for the accomplishment of such a state of things. He made Lord Clackington mount his own horse, bnt with his face to the tail ; and then, for fear he should fall off, he tied his ankles under the horse together, and slipping the reins over his head, he let him hold them something in the fashion of the tiller ropes of a boat \" Now be off !\" said Ogle. Ogle had taken the postilion's whip from him, and as he spoke, he literally laid it over the back of Lord Clackington. Hence the loud cries. combe. \" The lamp closer here, Ogle !\" oried Heron \u2014 \" the lamp !

Lord Clackington was able to see fairly and fully into the face of Felix Heron. \" The Earl of Whitcombe!\" heexolaimed \" Yes, Lord Clackington \u2014 the Earl of Whit combe, who, for some reason or another, which I cannot surmise, you have chosen to set yourself up as the foe to.\" \" Hem !

Tom Ripon had charge of the man who was of such great assistance to his lordship, and he was started off in a similar fashion. Captain Heron, therefore, was alone with the Countess of Bridgewater, who had quite recovered her spirits. \" Ah, Lord Whitcombe !\" she said. \" Let ma Then I am aU right !\" said Lord Clackington \u2014 \" and I defy you aU.

Nevertheless, I shall be well pleased to see Bridgewater, as the sight of him always tends to restore me to a better feeling for human nature !\" Certainly, Tom Ripon had all things as he would wish. He took one o! his holster pistols in his hand, and waited, with a nervous impatience, for the approach of the horseman. Another moment ! Yes \u2014 no ! Where was ha ? The sound of tha horse's feet suddenly ceased. All was profoundly still. The horse and his rider seemed either to have The post-boy was reluctant to act in the lervice of Captain Heron ; but Ogle had the whip in his hand, and two or three persuasive cuts with it con veyed arguments that there was no resisting. The chaise started for the country seat of Lord Bridgewater, at Finchley\u2014 a place that was then considered much further in the country than it is at present, when it almost forms a suburb of great overgTown London. Tom Ripon rode a little in the rear, aa a sort of guard against any attack from that direction, while Ogle went on in advance, with Captain Heron himself. dissolved into the night-air, or to have sunk into the earth. Tom Ripon began to feel rather uneasy. What could it mean ? Ee waited about three minutes more, and then, with the pistol In his hand, he moved his horsa forward, quite to the entrance of the lane. It looked more like the month of a cavern than anything else. Tom shaded his eyes with hit hand, as if such an act would, in the darkness, enable him to see better, and he strove to peer down into the black darkness of the lane. Heron was only too happy to remount Daisy ; and as Jack Sheppard had been much amused by the events of the night he rode from front to rear occasionally, exchanging a few words with Heron and Ogle, and then with Tom. The Countess of Bridgewater, too, would now and then look from the carriage window and speak to Heron , for she knew not how to say enough to express her gratitnde towards him. She knew, or suspected, that in this attempted abduction of her from her husband and from honour, Lord Clackington was but the infamous agent of a person higher than himself ; but with out something like positive proof that such was the case, Lady Bridgewater shrunk from saying as much even to Ft fix He; on. But he could see nothing. He could hear nothing. \" It's very odd,\" whispered Tom to himself. He felt as if he could not have spoken aloud, for the life of him, in that silent spot Bnr. scarcely had the whisper escaped his lips, when he felt a hand grasp his collar, and a voice cried out, \"Your money or your life! Cry out or make any resistance, and your brains will be found to-morrow morning scattering the hedgerow I\" Tom Ripon was so completely taken by surprise that his finger accidentally pressed the trigger of the pistol he held in his right hand, and of! tt went Bang! The echoes spread far and wide. \" Oh, that's your game, is it?\" added tha voice, and Tom felt something cold just touching hi. cheek.\" Now, as Tom Ripon rode on some hundred paces or so in the rear of the chaise, he felt cer tain that on some cross-road to the left he heard a horse's feet. \" Ah !\" said Tom, \" it's no game at all now, I rather think ! Tom fell back still further, which he was easy able to do by slackening his pace, and then he halted altogether to listen. Yes ; there could be no doubt about it By the shape of the trees and the hedgerow a little further stUl ia advance, Tom Ripon felt sure he saw the entrance of one of those narrow, shadowy lanes so common in that part of the country. It was up this lane, towards the high road, that Tom felt sure now that he heard some one coming. Now Tom Ripon did not feel that he had shone that night as a highwayman, and he particularly wanted to do so, U any fair chance presented itself. \" Do you know what this is ? asked the voice as the something cold pressed a Uttle close to his cheek. \"Yes!\" \"What is it?\" \" The muzzle of a pistol !\" \" Are you not afraid ? \" No. Blaze away !\" \" You are no coward, then, it seems.\" \" Never was !\" \" Well, a man who is not a coward never throws away his life for tbe mere folly of the thinpr-so hand out all the money and other valuables you possess, and I wUl bid you ;,-ood night, and God speed !\" Tom felt flattered. Was this a chance ? It looked like one. He was called a tr\u00bbn, and considered and proved one, too. To be sum, it was in the dark, so that the highwaymm into whose hands, in such a 'catching a Tartar' sort of fashion, he had fallen, could not see what he was ; but for all that, Tom was pleased. \"Will you be so g^ ? \" he said, \"as to tell me who you are ?\" \" Oh, yes\u2014 I am Claude Duvel I\" \u00bb No !\" By the sound of the horse's feet, it was evidently only one person that was approaching; so the difficulty could not be great of crying, \" Stand and deliver !\" Tom made up his mind, therefore, to take his post at the corner of the shadowy lane, and, for the third time that night, try his fortune as a knight of the road. The footsteps of the coming horseman rapidly approached. Tha shadow of the horse and its rider Tom fancied he could see on the opposite busies. All other sounds but those of the trot of the horse were still; for the chais\u00b0, and those who were with it, had got too far now in advance to be at aU heard on the soft country road. \" I say yes I\" \" But Claude Duval vra. shot some thirty or fo-ty, or more than that, years ago !\" \" That may be ; but stUl I am Claude Duval. I am his great nephew, and named after him, you comprehend But as I have no time to waste, I"], [250, "244 EDITH HERON The hanosome young highwayman, in all his beauty of costume, with his chesnnt horse, had disappeared at the same moment that the small band-lantern was extinguished ; as if the disap pearance of the light was as a matter of course the vanishing of the bright vision that had met Tom's eyes. \"Speak again! \u2014 oh, speak again!\" cried Tom. \" I want to hear yon and see you again !\" There was no reply. Tom turned his horse's head down the lane. once more, before I shoot you, ask you for your money, watch, and what jewellery or other articles of value you have about you !\" v I have none.\" \" Nonsense ! A gentleman on a horse must have some!\" \"' I ain't a gentleman.\" \"Ah! Sayyeuso?\" There was a sharp, crackling sonnd, and a match was lit at the same time that the same voice said, \" Two of yon cover him well with your carbines, while I take a look at him, since he says he is not a gentleman, and has no booty for us.\" \" Hoy ! hoy ! I implore you \u2014 I beg of you, not to go away I I, too, am on the road ; and so is one that I know, who you would be glad to know! Say something ! \u2014 oh, say something ! I know you are only hiding in the dark !\" \"Beware!\" said a voice. \"Beware of what? What is the danger? I am not afraid \u2014 you kaow that I am not afraid ! What am I to beware of? Oh, do show yourself again !\" CHAPTER XCI. TOM RIPON CONCLUDES HIS ADVENTURES, ADD FEELS CONFIDENT HE HAS SEEN A SPIRIT. If Tom Ripon had had any idea of making an active resistance to the behests of the highwayman, thi. little intimation that he was \" covered \" by two carbines would have been sufficient to put it out of his head. \" Could you bear the Bight ?\" \" Yes\u2014 yes; and delight in it !\" \"Behold!\" There was a broad, but faint ray of light, like a moonbeam, that self ri^ht across the lane, aud took iuto its presence an object that nearly turned Tom's heart to stone to look at it Tom was courageous enough ; but he did not think it at aU necessary absolutely to throw a way his life. A gibbet was erected about thirty paces down the lane, and on it hung a hideous object, from which a few rags of clothing fluttered. All the rest was blackened bone. Besides, he now had no fire-arms at his com mand, and he felt that he was pretty well at the meroy of the personage he had thought to make so easy and quick a prey of. Tfcs state of things was not satisfactory. Cer tainly Tom Ripon's lucky star, if he had one, was not in the ascendant that night. This was the third attempt he had mada upon the road, and it bade fair to be the worst of all. If, however, the match and tbe little hand-lan tern which the highwayman lit enabled that per son to get a good look at Tom, it likewise en abled Tom to take a visual survey of his opponent in business. The skeleton of some malefactor, who had there been hung in chains, was before Tom Ripon. \" Behold !\" said the voice, again. \" You have seen me as I was in life; and now you see my mortal remains, as the veugeance of man has left them !\" The cold, broad beam of light vanished, and Tom was in darkness again. The skeleton malefactor on the gibbet conld no longer be seen ; _ut Tom Ripon felt that he should never forget it while memory remained to him as a faculty of his mind- He clapped spurs to his horse, and, with a speed as if the gibbeted malelactor were pursuing him, he galloped onwards after the chaise aud Felix Heron. That survey fiUed Tom with the wildest emo tions of envy. The highwayman was young and strikingly handsome. He rode a beautiful chesnut horse. His whole appearance was striking in the extreme. Let ns begin at his hat A black beaver, trimmed with silver lace, and a drooping feather that hung most gracefully around its brim, secured by a glittering ornament that dazzled Tom's eyes to look upon. A scarlet coat, with silver cord and braid. TaU boots of Spanish leather, that fitted to perfection. A cravat of flue lace. Raffies, and long, taper fingers, loaded with handsome rings. Such was the figure that met the gaze of Tom Ripon, and which he considered to be the 6etta ideal of a handsomo, gallant knight of the road. Envy and admiration beamed from Tom's eyes. * Why,\" said the gorgeous-looking young high wayman, after looking at Tom for a few seconds, \" it is only a boy!\" Tom was deeply mortified. \" Good night !\" The lantern went ont, as if of its own accord, and the darkness came down, apparently with tenfold blackness. \" Hilloa !\" cried a voice; \" who comes at such a break-reck speed ?\" The voice was Jack Sheppard's. It had never sounded to Tom Ripon so welcome as it did now, for he longed for human companionship He puUed up sharply \u2014 so sharply, indeed, that he was nearly projected over his horse's head. \" Hoy ! is that you, Jack?\" \" Yes. What i'om ? What is tho matter ?\" \" I don't know!\" \" Then I'm quite sure I don't\" \" Oh, Jack !\" \"Oh, Tom!\" \" Don't go on mocking me ; but I have seen a sight that you would not like to see. Oh, dear! \u2014 oh, dear ! I have seen a ghost, Jack !\" \"No!\" \" I have \u2014 I have ! Do you happen to know if \u2014 if anybody \u2014 any highwayman has been hanged hereabouts, and \u2014 and gibbeted, too, Jack, eh ? \" \" Not for a long time, Tom. A young fellow, who used to be on the road, and was believed to be a grand-nephew of the celebrated Claude Duval, was taken, and hanged in chains at the top of one of the lanes hereabouts, for shooting a lawyei there ; bnt I don't know which lane it is.\" \" Stop ! stop !\" oried Tom Ripon ; \" I want to see you again \u2014 I want to speak to you!\" A rushing wind swept over the spot Tom stretched forth his hands. He even rode forward a pace or two. \" I do.\" Bnt he was alone."], [251, "EDITH HERON. 245 \"Well, I don't want to know, for they say that his ghost haunts tbe spot, in full cosiume, as he nseo to cry \u2022 Stand and deliver,' on the road ; but ib:.' s all idle talk.\" estate, up a long and beautiful avenue of ohesnnts, to the house. FeeUng that now there was no danger to Lady Bridgewater, Felix Heron rode en before. Daisy took a short out across a garden, and, dark as it was, leaped a fence in good style. A light appeared in a spacious ball, and more lights from a range of windows on the ground floor. \u2022' No, it ain't !\" said Tom Ripon, res lutely. \" It's all true, for I have seen the ghost this very night 1\" \"' You, Tom ?\" \" Even I, Jack ; and I feel now as if I conld hardly draw my breath, and I don't think I shaU ever bo the same man again !\" \" The same boy, you mean !\" \"Jack Sheppard \u2014 Mr. Jack Sheppard?\" \" Well, Mr. Tom Ripon.\" \" I will trouble you not to make any disparag ing remarks. 1 am not a common housebreaker !\" \"Very good! But it seems to me, Tom, that you had better turn your hand to something the than life on the road ; for, first of all, yon caoght me, and then you caught the players, and now you have caught a ghost, and none of the catches look as if they would pay the expenses, Tom !\" One of these windows was then suddenly opened, and a figure appeared. FeUx Heron did not doubt that it was his friend the young Earl, and he was confirmed by the voice. \" Who is there\u2014 who is there ? Who rides upon the lawn ef the house at this hour ? Speak, or I fire!\" \" Nay, my good friend Bridgewater, do no such thing, or you may chance to shoot the most grate ful of your friends.\" \" Good heavens ! the Earl of Whitcombe !\" \" The same.\" \" No, no ! Away, away ! Away with you at once, impostor \u2014 away ! I know you now : you are my half-drunken whipper-in, WiU Adams I Be off with you, sir, at once, wiU you !\" Captain Heron was too much astonished at this reception from his friend the young Earl, to understand what it could mean at the moment Tom Ripon was by far too indignant at Jack Sheppard for making this provoking summary of his night's adventures, to make any reply for some few minutes, and it was a great relief to him to see that they were rapidly nearing the chaise. With ratber a dignified look, Tom waved his arm, although the action was lost in tbe darkness, and taid, \" Jack, we won't quarrel about nothing at all, and I don t feel quite sure in my own mind whether or not I wUl say anything to the Captain about the ghost of the grand-nephew of Claude Dnval.\" But slowness of apprehension was by no means to be laid to the charge of Felix Heron. He was certain, npon a rapid second thought that the Earl of Bridgewater had a meaning which it would be well for him to attend to. He turned his horse's head at once to fly. \" Hold !\" cried a voice. \"Why not, Tom? On the contrary, I would advise you to tell him all about it, as it is sure to interest him ! If you don't teU him, I wiU !\" \"Then I will!\" \" Who speaks ?\" \" Unmask your lights I\" shouted some one. The sUdes from several lanterns were hastily withdrawn, and a broad gleam of Ught feU upon Captain Heron and Daisy. An officer in uniform \u2014 in the unfform of the King's Light Horse \u2014 advanced with his drawn sword in his hand. The fact was, that th . s'ory was by far too in teresting an one for Tom Bipon to think of keep ing to himseU ; and he rode en till he came up to Felix Heron, and then and there he told it to him, with every embellishment that his excited fancy suggested. \" I knew that there was snch a sight to be seen in one of the lanea hereabouts,\" Baid Heron; \" but never looked for it I\" \" Felix Heron,\" he said, \" falsely calling your self Earl of Whitcombe, I summon you to sur render, in the King's name, on a charge of trea son !\" \" What a ghost, Captain ?\" \" No : a dead man, hung in chains on \" The King is mistaken,\" cried Heron, and he touched Daisy lightly with his heel. The faithful creature made a bound forward, and the officer then cried out, sternly, \" Make ready present carbines !\" \" Hold !\" cried Heron. \" I have the Ufe of one here which I think is as dear as my own-\" He rapidly dismounted as he spoke, and then added, \" Away, Daisy\u2014 away !\" The obedient creature leaped the fence, and was lost in the darkness, while Captain Heron made a dash in at the window of the room from which the Earl of Whitcombe had just emerged. \" Recover arms 1\" cried the officer on the lawn. \" The prisoner is caught !\" gibbet!\" Lady Bridgewater, at this moment, called from the carriage io Felix Heron to stop. \" We are there !\" she said. \" That gate at the road-side leads to the ledge entrance to The Elms!\" \" Then,\" replied Heron, \" I do not see the ne cessity of keeping this post-boy with us any longer ; and, Ogle, you wUl be so good as start him to London !\" \" In the same way as his master ?\" asked Ogle \" Well,\" replied Heron, with a smile, \" I think it would be unjust to treat him any worse, and great partiality to treat him any better!\" Ogle, despite all the oaths and imprecations of the post-boy, who fully well knew what Lord Clackington had been about, and had aided him to the utmost of his ability, secured him on the horse in the same manner that he had done his lordship, and sent him to town. \" Ah I\" cried Heron, as he found some three or four officers in the room, and a mtiitary guard at its door, \u2014 \" ah ! it seems I am lost 1\" \" Found, sir, U you please I\" said a man in a plain black suit, stepping up, and laying his hand npon the shoulder of Captain Heron. \" I arrest you in the King's name, and by virtue of my office as pursuivant at arms. The young Earl of Bridgewater looked very pale, but he made no interference, beyond saying in a voice of great anguish, \" Alas ! alas ! that this should happen beneath a roof of mine.\" There remained, then, but one horse in the chaise, and with that the vehicle, which, no doubt, had had a very different destination, was drawn through the lodge gate of Lord Bridgewater's"], [252, "246 EDITH HERON. Felix Heron was armed \u2014 he had loaded pistols in his pooket, but of what avail could they be to him now ? He might take one, two, or more Uves, but what then ? He was surrounded, and eape was out of the question. \"With life there ib hope,\" he said. \"Sir, I yield!\" \" No !\" said Heron, and he stepped behind a chair, and produced a pistol- The doors of the room were then flung open, and Lady Bridgewater appeared, oalling out * Henry !\u2014 Henry! It is yonr dear friend the Earl of Whitcombe who this night has saved me from a fate worse than death !\" \" Good God I\" The Countess of Bridgewater fell npon the breast of her young husband in a passion of tears. He looked thoroughly bewildered. \" Are all whom 1 love in this world to come upon ina this night in the most surprising manner ?\" CHAPTER XCII. CAPTAIN HERON IS CONVEYED TO THE TOWER OF LONDON, AND MEETS WITH STRANGB AD- VENTURES. Captain Heron smUed in his engaging manner, as he said, \" I have, it seems, fallen into a mis fortune, but I will not caU this night altogether an nnlucky one, since it has enabled me to be of some service to Lady Bridgewater.\" The Countess had exchanged some rapid whispers with her husband, who then advanced, and grasped Heron by the hands, whUe grateful tears startled to his eyes. Mr. Mogsworth thought that a lucky moment had come for him to act and he dashed behind tha chair with bis handcuffs. The pursuivant at aims made a low bow to Heron, and took from his pocket a strip of parch ment with a seal at one comer. \" If, sir, he said, you would like to see my war rant, here it is.\" \" I have no such curiosity,\" replied Heron. \" I yield to a foroe which no sane man should hope to resist\" \" And in a house of mine ! and in a house of mine !\" moaned the young Earl of Bridgewater. \" Nay, my friend,\" said Heron in cheerful tones ; \" it is not the house that commits its owner.

Rescue! In the King \\s name, I call upon all to aid me 1\" cried the pur suivant. \" Indeed you would, Whitcombe \u2014 indeed you would!\" \"Permit me to remark, my Lord Bridgewater,\" said the pursuivant \" that as a member of His Majesty's Privy Council, these remarks are im prudent\" \" I was never the most prudent person in the world, Mr. Pursuivant ; aud although still young, I am too old to learn caution now ; so I say agaiu that I would have given my right hand rather than my friend should have faUen into this misfor tune in a house of mine.\" \" No, sir,\" said Heron. \" Yon do your duty, and do it like a gentleman, without the aid of that low ruffian.

Upon you let any blame that may arise rest\" \"It was suggested,\" replied the pursuivant, \" that you might be here, and I was accommodated with a troop of the King's Light Horse to assist me.\" \" Oh, willingly \u2014 willingly!\" Oaptain Heron laid down the pistol instantly. \" I will go with you,\" said Bridgewater. \" No, no I\" \" Oh, yes, I will \u2014 I must !\" \" No ; you will go somewhere else !\" Felix Heron laid an emphasis upon these words which at once let the Earl know what he meant, which was that he should repair to Epping Forest to the protection of Eiith. \" Yes,\" cried the Earl, as he took the hand of his wife, \"ztie wiU go eoaiewhere else I\" By that he meant to infer that he and his Countess would both seek Edith, to convey to her such hope and such comfort as they could. 41 Then I am re*dy I\" said Heron. There was one thing that he felt quite sa tisfied about ; and that was the escape of those who had beeu with him. \" It is very strange that it should be so sug gested.\" \" I know nothing further, Bir.\" The grinding of the wheels of the chaise at this instant was plainly heard close to the ball door. \" An arrival s\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater. \" And an opportune one,\" said the pursuivant; \" as I can engage the coach, or whatever vehicle it may be, on the service of His Majesty, to convey my prisoner to the Tower. Sir, let me ask you one question.\" \"What is it, Mr. Pursuivant?\" said Felix Heron. \" WiU you give me your word and honour for the next four hours not to attempt to escape ?\" \"No, sir!\" \" Then I am compelled to \u2014 to \" The pursuivant beckoned to a coarse, com mon-looking man, who had been loitering about the window, and added, \"Mr. Mogsworth, yon can do your duty.\" \" Now, sir !\" said Mr. Mogsworth, as he ad vanced with a pair of handcuffs- Ogle, Tom Eipon, and Jack Sheppard were none of them to be seen from the moment that he, Heron, was fairly surrounded by the King's Light Horse. And he could not but admire the presence of mind of Ogle in this matter ; for he had with him no other force than the two mere boys, as Tom and Jack were ; and any attempt by"], [253, "EDITH HERON. 247 violence to help him, Heron, could only have ended in disaster, and made his situation aU that much the worse. The body of Light Horse amounted to twenty five men, with no less than three commissioned officers in command of them. When mounted, they formed a very formidable escort indeed, from which it did not seem very likely that there wonld be any chance of esoape. \" May I ask, Mr. Pursuivant,\" said Heron, as he stepped into the chaise which had on that evening carried such a number of persons, \u2014 \"may I ask what is our destination ?\" \" Yes, sir ; the Tower of London I\" \" Oh, the Tower of London !\" cried Heron, in a lond voice. \" Impossible !\" \" So I think, as far as you are concerned; but that some such papers were found, there can be no doubt; perhaps, not by any very difficult search, since \u2014 since \" \"Since what?\" \" Hush ! Those who hide can find !\" \" I comprehend you ; and thank you for aU this kindness and courtesy. Oh, where are we new ?\" \" On Tower HUl !\" A cold feel came across the heart of Felix Heron as he felt himself in the shadow of that gloomy fortress, which had been not only the prison-house, but the murder-den, of many a brave and innocent heart. The chaise stopped at the wicket-gate of the Ward Tower. A lond knock was given by the persuivant. \" Who knocks ?\" shouted a voice. The pursuivant shook his head ; for he knew perfectly weU that the tone in which his prisoner spoke was adopted for the purpose of letting some person or persons know where he was to be taken. \" King's prisoner 1\" \" Enter, King's prisoner !\" There was a roU of drums, and the guard turned out as the chaise rumbled into the court yard, close to the old Lion Tower. In ten minutes more Felix Heron was In a small room iu one of the towers, the stone walls of which, in their thickness, U multiplied by two, would have occupied a larger space than the whole area of the apartment. He was left in darkness. \" You wUl prevent me, sir,\" he said, \" from re plying to you!\" \" Sir,\" said Heron, \" in my position, I daresay you would do as I do !\" \" Perhaps !\" \" Ready ?\" asked the officer of the troop of King's Light Horse. \" Quite, Captain, U you please !\" \" Then forward ! Advance ! Trot !\" The chaise was pretty weU surrounded by the escort, and Mr. Mogsworth had been promoted to the situation of postilion. Off set the cavalcade, at a brisk pace. The pursuivant, looking rather red in the face and excited, eat opposite to FeUx Heron in the coach. The flush of the warder's lantern, as the door of the room was opened, had let him see that there was a sloping board on the floor, and some straw. That was his bed. Felix Heron disdained to complain, and he said not a word. A long sUence ensued between them, and at last the pursuivant said, in a low tone of voice, \" Ferhaps, air, it may do you some little good to know from whom the suggestion came to send a force to the country seat of Lord Bridgewater ?\" \" Thank you.\" \" It was Lord Clackington who advised the measure.\" He heard a ponderous lock shot into its socket. He heard a bar of iron, of great weight, placed over the door. And then he heard the sound of the retreating footsteps of the warder, and he felt terribly lonely. \"Edith! Edith!\u2014 my own dear Edith!\" he cried ; \" who wUl comfort thee now ?\" The thought was agony. For the space of about half an hour, Felix Heron felt, for the first time in his life, almost in clined to give way to despair. Then he strove with himself for better spirits. \"No, no!\" he cried. \"For thy sweet sake, Edith, I wiU yet strive against this blow of fate, and hope once again to look into thy dear eyes beneath the old forest trees of Epping 1\" As he spoke, a faint Ught Ulnmined the prison room. \" WhUe he tried to run off with the Earl's wife!\" \" Indeed, sir !\" \"It is so. IfoUedhim.\" \" I know nothing about that ; only I do know that Lord Clackington advised the force to go to The Elms at Finchley, and stay there, on the chance of capturing you.\" \" Exactly ; in which case, he knew tbat the Earl would be sure to stay at home, instead of riding down the North Road to meet his Countess.\" Where could it come from ? \" It may be so, sir \u2014 I don't know ; but \u2014 but if I can do you any service, pray command me.\" \" I thank you very much ; and the only service I ask of you is, not \u2014 in yonr report of to-night's work \u2014 to say anything which can have a tendency to bring trouble on the head of tbe Earl of Bridge water.\" \" Be assured I wUl not, sir. You ask nothing on yonr own account?\" \" Nothing I\" \" Then 1 wiU never believe that a man, who can be so noble-hearted and so disinterested, can stoop to assassination I\" \"TTo what, sir?\" Was it moonlight ? Felix Heron started up from the plank and the straw, and looked warily about him. The faint light increased. Felix Heron could not but be full of astonish ment that snch a phenomenon should show itself in that gloomy abode. But he was soon absorbed in attention to a something more impottant than the Ught CHAPTER XCIII. \" I am imprudent ! I ought not to teU you what is whispered abont against yon at Court, but I wiU. It is said, that in Whitcombe House was found some written details of a plan to take the Use of the King I\" CAPTAIN HERON IS VTSITHD RY THE APPARITION OF THE LADY IN WHITE.

Before Captain Heron could sufficiently make up his mind to take any energetic course, the room was in darkness, and he was alene again. With the last flash of the light, all his energies came back to him. progress which was barred by a chain or a lock, came upon his ears. What it could possibly mean was beyond his faculties to determine, bnt in a few seconds the faint light that had iUumined that dreary room in tbe Tower became much more brilliant, and made a distinct, wide angle of light on the waU and on the ceUing. He saw from whence it came ; and, to his great surprise, a huge stone in the wall, which did not seem as if it had been moved since the Tower was built, slowly revolved upon its centre. As this stone thns revolved, Felix Heron saw that the mysterious light which had shone into his dungeon came frem some lamp or candle, whioh was carried about the height of a human being. Then he saw a hand and the lamp, which was a smaU, antique-looking hand one, burning oil. Slowly, but with a 6tedfast movement in which there was no hurry or excitement, a figure made its way into the apartment through the opening in the wall. He darted forward to the moveable stone, and cried out aloud, \" Stop !\u2014 stop 1 One word ! Only 6peak to me one word, to tell me that escape from this place is possible I\" No. There was no reply. The figure was gone. He'felt eagerly with his hands the wall, but it seemed to be all solid, and not the least movement could he detect in any of the stones. Was it a dream ? That was the question Felix Heron anxiously asked himself. Then, before he could make up his mind on the matter, there came a sharp knocking at the door of the prison room. \" Hilloa ! hilloa !\" cried a voice. \" Hilloa !\" The figure was a female one. The first impulse of Felix Heron had been to put himself as much as possible upon his guard, for all that he had ever heard and read of the many sanguinary crimes committed in the Tower of London, crowded to his memory. How could he tell but that he might be destined to add yet another to the terrible muster roll of martyrs to that fearful place ? But when he saw that his visitor was feminine, gentler and far happier feelings came over him. There was gentleness, mercy, and hope in the aspect of that sex, which had ever been to him the suggestion of all that was good and kind in human nature. \" What is the matter ?\" shouted Heron. \" Nay,\" said the voice ; \" that is what I want to ask you!\" \"Nothing!\" \" Well, the sentinel said you were calling out as if ill ! I am the night warder on the rounds !\" \"No, no! Yet \u2014 I want to speak to you ! Open the door ! I want a light ! I will pay you what ever orice you demand for a light!\" \"Not allowed!\" That was the brief answer; and the next mo ment Heron heard the descending footsteps of the warder. He was alone again. Ah ! could he really say that ? What if there were such things as apparitions between heaven and earth ? \u2014 and what if that gloomy stony apartment were subject to their visitations ? Perhaps this mysterious female, whoever she was, had come to save him. Perhaps he had unconsciously evoked pity in the heart of this person. He spoke. \" Ah! how shall I thank you?\" The words came involuntarily from his lips; but even as he uttered them he shrank back as far as the opposite wall of his prisen would let him, end a creeping sensation of terror came across his heart. The supposition sent a cold chill to the hesrt of Heron. But, constitutionally brave, and by no means inclined to superstition, although thoughts of the supernatural wonld occur to him at times, as it will occur to the clearest and strongest intellect, Felix Heron soon convinced himself that what he had seen was either altogether a famUiarly vivid dream or a reality. That is to say, a physical reality. Not a ghostly visitation. He tried to convince himself that there must be a stone in the thick wall of the place, which, if he did bnt know the secret of making it move, would revolve upon its centre. This was, to him, by far too interesting a sub ject of inquiry to be neglected. He summoned all his energies to the task of discovering the truth. The impression upon his mind of the exact spot through which the strange visitant had come, was too vivid to permit him to make ai^r great practical mistake on that head. The stonee composing the wall were about three feet in height, and about five feet in length. This made a very ponderous bit of masonry, so that if he hit upon the wrong one it wonld Carry him to quite a different part of the wall. Heron, therefore, when he did as he now did, make half a dozen steps in the direction tbat the figure had vanished, felt quite sure that he placed his hand upon the stone that had The female form that slowly made its way into his dungeon, took not the slightest notice of his half-exclamatory speech. Slowly and sadly, with a fixed and stedfast look, the figure advanced. It walked cautiously, although it was with a strange jerking motion, as though some one felt the danger of a precipice in the dark. The eyes had no expression in them. They were fixed and glassy. The dress of the strange visitor was white from head to foot A long, streaming mass of very dark hair hung down her shoulders and back, reaohiug to her waist Felix Heron regarded this vision with wonder. But he did not after the first few seconds, feel the kind o! fear that had at first laid hold of his soul. He spoke again. \" If you be mortal, reply to me ; and if you be not, and it is not permitted yon to hold parley with one who is still on this side of eternity, make some sign that I may know as mnch 1\" The figure pause i.

Moreover, although Felix Heron might possibly have tbonght tbat one of the secrets of nature might consist in the appearance of disembodied spirits, he did not think they would carry hand- lamps about with them. But where did this opening in the wall lead to? That was the question. It was one that not only Heron had no means of answering, but, in consequence of the darkness, he could not tell but that ihe first step into it might uot plunge him into some abyss, at the bottom of which he might be an undiscovered, mangled corpse. He stretched his arms throngh the opening. He felt the cold, rugged stones of some other wall. He tried it in all directions. Inch by inch he applied pressure to it, from one of its edges onwards. Then downwards. Then laterally. The stone moved. The moment that it did so the further action of it was easy. It revolved with a slight grating motion. What peculiar construction beneath it enabled it so to move, Heron neither knew nor paused to speculate upon. It was sufficient for him that the stone did move, and that consequently he had overcome the principal difficulty.

The room, or dungeon, for it was more ot the latter than tho former, strongly resembled tbe place of his own imprisonment. There was the same low-arched door, and the same deep recesses, with perpendicular slits in the stone-work, for arohers to fire through. Some straw, and a plank of wood, and a stool, were the only articles of furniture in the place. But there was the oil lamp. Where was its bearer ? That foot rested on something. Was it a stair ? Yes ; there could be no donbt about It The patsage beyond the opening was in the thickness of the wall, and led downwards by a winding flight of old stone or wooden steps. He could not just then determine which they were. Heron looked at the lamp, and saw that, from the small quantity of oU in it, it could not last much above half an hour longer. If he were to receive any assistance from it in his researches in the towti be must be wary aud speedy in what he was abou*. The first act of Heron was to examine the walls carefully, in the hope of seeing some indications of yet another revolving stone. No \u2014 not the remotest sign of sueh a thing waa to &e seen. But there were steps, and that was sufficient for him. Felix Heron trusted himself to Providence, and with a brief prayer to heaven to save him, for the sake of one who was still worthier than he \u2014 his Edith \u2014 he commenced the descent of the narrow winding stairs. He could feel the wall as he went It was rough and damp. He heard a rustling sonnd. To pause instantly, and bend every faculty into the sense of listening, was natural. The rattling sound continued for a few seconds, and then died away. Was it natural or supernatural ? A squeaking disturbance settled the question. RaU inhabited lhat place. Heron disturbed the vermin, but he still de scended. His only wonder was where they found food in suoh a region as that The stair then ceased. It was really quite an accident that induced Heron to push the door of the place, and it was a surprise to find it open. It yielded in an instant, and then Captain Heron felt that he could proceed still further in the track of the mysterious lady in white, with the long hair. CHAPTER XOIV. But Heron found lhat although they so ceased, uo further means of progress seemed open to him. SOMB. OF THE OLD HORRORS AND SECRETS OF THB TOWS-K OF LONDON ARE DISOOVKBED Nothing but the solid wall, with the rough side of the stones next to him could he feel or fiud. The staircase immediately beneath the door of the room in which Heron had found the lamp was peculiarly damp, and there was a green mould upon the old stone steps. Captain Heron paused a moment, and he asked himself as he did so, whether he could recollect how high he had ascended from what was the ground-floor of the Tower in whioh he had been imprisoned to his cell or dungeon. He thought that the winding stairs in the wall had been sufficient to bring him down to that ground- floor, and if such were the case, these still descending steps, on which he was, were taking him below the surface into the lowermost regions of the ancient fortress- If Felix Heron was disappointed a little, he was not discouraged, for he could not believe that the revolving stone in the waU of his prison vom and the winding staircase in the thickness 1 1 he wall, were all for nothing. Besides, what had become of the figure with the lamp? Either he had passed some other opening, or there was one at the foot of the steps. :t was much more likely that the latter should be the case. If otherewise, there would have been no neces sity for continuing the steps, and cost and trouble so low. Heron felt convinced that it was where he was \u2014 namely, at the foot of the staircase \u2014 that he was to seek for the means of further progress. That search was tedious. Tbat might account for the slimy green moss upon them. That moss which made them so slippery that had they been coated with ice their descent could scarcely have been more hazardous. Something he saw about four steps below him. He recoiled as he saw it, for it was in motion. He held the lamp low down. A hideous toad, of onusual dimensions, was descending the steps before him. Heron fairly retreated a couple of steps, and then he felt ashamed of his horror at a creature which, although repulsive in outward form, was stUl far more harmless than many a brighter and more graceful thing of Use. \" How muoh more estimable,\" said Captain Heron to himself, \" is a toad than such a man as Jonathan Wild ?\" With this sentiment he began to descend again, and the toad preceded him, flopping down awk wardly from step to step on the mouldy stairs. As Heron descended he found the dampness of the air materially increase. The mould and moss, too, upon the stairs were At length, in the narrow crovice between two stones he felt a small projection of iron. It was colder to the touch than the snrroundirg stone. He pressed it, pushed it, puUed it, then he moved it laterally. That sufficed. Another stone, similar to the one he had suc ceeded in moving in the waU of his own room, re volved- A flash of Ught came npon the eyes of Felix Heron. In contrast to the darkness of the place in which ne had been, that flash of light seemed to him to b_ pecuUarly strong and vivid- And yet it only came from the little lamp which the feminine visitor to his prison had carried. As Heron looked through the orifice in the wall he saw that that light was on the floor- But the lady with tbe long hair and the white thicker. garments was gone."], [257, "EDITH HERON. 251 It was with quite a grateful feeling that such was the case that he reached the foot of those stairs A quantity of straw and sawdust was on tho floor. In the midst of that he saw some strange objects. The straw and the sawdust, too, seemed to be quite matted together by some liquid, the odour of which was strange and sickening. The object in the middle of the dungeon was a block, such as is used for beheading purposes. By its side lay an axe. Mouldering in corruption, close to the block was a headless trunk. Then, however, he fonnd that he was in not only a strange place, but in strange company like wise. The floor on which he trod sloped rapidly in the direction away from the foot of the stairs. A door hanging by one hinge had shut up the staircase at one time, and as Heron held up the light, he saw that as tbe floor eloped down in the direction away from where he stood, it changed to a pool of black pestiferous-looking water. In fact he seemed to stand, so to speak, on the margin of a stagnant and a gloomy lake. That made np the strange place in which he was. Lying over the feet of the headless trunk was t female form, in white, or what had once been white, apparel, with long black hair streaming do wn the shoulders. Heron was bewUdered. The strange company we have mentioned con sisted of a number of toads, a peculiar-looking beetle, and some large rats. The latter crouched up close to the waU, seem ing to think, if they hid their eyes, the strange visitor could not see them. \"Good heavens!\" he ejaculated, \"is this my feminine visitor ?\" He stooped to look closer. One hand and arm were stretched out among the sawdust and the straw. Nothing but the yellow bones remained. It was evident that the hand and the arm ot that figure iu white had been there for many a long year. It might have been that the time had com. for decomposition to do its work in snch a way, or it might be that tne disturbance of the air caused by the visit of Felix Heron to that place produced the effect, but the body of the lady iu the once white garments seemed to collapse, or fall in, so to speak, as if it were mouldering away into no thing. The sudden movement made Heron shrink back. The toads looked at Heron with fearless eyes. A little further observation enabled Heron to comprehend his situation very well- He was below the level of the old Tower moat, * Loch was then always full at high tide of the liver. Throngh a grating which he saw quite plainly M the wall over on the other t-ide of the black pool of water the moat overflowed, and kept .streaming in an intermittent kind of way into the dungeon. How fearful a prison for some poor wretoh, who, at each flow of the tide, had to retreat to the higher end of it to escape drowning, and who might be left to all the horror of imagining that some spring tide would flood the dungeon, and condemn him to a wretched death ! He utiered a cry, too, that sounded strangely in that dismal place. Then all was still again. If those poor remains of mortaUty were undis turbed so long, it might, perhaps, be another ce a tury or more before such another change would take place Felix Heron did not know why he fell a great curiosity to look for the head of the decapitated body, but he did so. It was not to be fonnd. \" What am I to do ?\" said Heron. The words came involuntarily from his lips, and they found a dismal echo in that dreary place. He thought then that it would be useless to retrace his steps, and that he would still continue to explore as far as he could the lower regions of the Tower. Then Heron came to the conclusion that this was the body of some one who had been privately exe cuted in the Tower for high treason long ago, and that in aU probability, the head had been taken away as an ornament to Temple Bar. There is still living a gentleman who has heard his father say that he knew some one who had seen the grizly, bleached heads of traitors, so caUed, on Temple Bar- Heron turned away with a shudder. His feelings and thoughts, in regard to the visitant of his prison room, were more confused than ever. He crept on close to the waU on the raised side of tbe dungeon. He had a hope of finding some means of ascending from that pestiferous place, the bad air and the mephitio vapours of which already began to give him a feeling of fainlness and Kic knees- Y es, thank heaven ! There was a door \u2014 not hanging to one binge like that at the foot of the stairs, but swinging open. Gladly did Heron pass through it, and com mence an upward progress now to the tower above him. He ascended the remainder of the staircase. \" Oh, welcome I welcome !\" he cried out as he felt a gush of cool air on his brow. Where did it come from ? The staircase, on which Felix Heron now was, did not wind round in that spiral fashion that the other ones he had descended had, bu\" it was com posed of rectangular flights of about twelve steps each. He could not divine its origin. He reached the top of the stairs. The cool air was stUl on his face, but he had not the least per ception of from whence it proceeded. At the termination of each of those flights there was a small square landing. From those landings opened doors leading to dungeons. They were all fast bnt one. That one was the first that Heron came to. That is to say, it was on the first flight He held up the oU-lamp to look at the kind of roof which was above his head, and he was asto nished at what it was composed of. Cannon balls ! Yes ; there could not be two opinions in regard to it The lamp showed him the convex surfaces of cannon balls. He entered that dungeon. A fearful sight presented itself."], [258, "EDITH III-mON. 252 They all slightly projected through square holes in a sort of framework of stained wood. What could it mean ? Heron strove to think, to found some theory upon this phenomenon which should explain it He knew that on bastions and fortifications generally heaps of cannon balls were to be found, aud he recoUected that once he had seen such a heap displaced, and beneath them there had been a kind of wooden tray to hold the first rectan gular parcel. Was he beneath a pile of cannon balls ? \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes I\" \" You're a ghosteses 1\" \" No, Dennis\u2014 no ! Oh, remove some of the cannon bills, and let me out 1\" \"Out ov what?\" \" Out of this place! Oh, Dennis, for the love of the old cabin at Ballyganeit !\" \"Murder! \" \" Aud Judy McCrae! \" \" Bedad, and by this and by that, he knows it all he does ! An' he knows me ! Are you a Christian, or is it hatheH mithiolology gives you the sarmin ?\" \"A Christian!\" \" You see I had a broughtin' up full ov the laming?\" \" Yes, Dennis, I see that !\" It looked like it. The air that blew upon his brow and was so grateful to his senses came from the open sky, and rushed to him from those cannon balls. \" Hilloa ! Bedad, and what's that ?\" cried a voice, in unmistakable Irish accents. At that moment the last drop of oil in the little lamp that Felix Heron carried was exhausted, and tbe little flame that had hitherto served him so well, went out \"By this and by that, then,\" said the voice again, \"and it's gone, any way !\" Heron listened. \" Aisy, now \u2014 aisy, Donnis,\" said the voice again. \" Aisy, now ; it's trouble you'll ba after getting yourself into, if you say that the balls was all alight and blazin' 1 But it's my own eyes that seed it, and divil a bit would the own eyes ov me tell a lie, any way. It's an airy and wide berth I'll be after giving them same. They might Wow np ! Hubbaboo ! Away would go Dennis O'Fla herty, ov the ould Connaught Rangers.\" The rattle of a musket, as it was shouldered, aud the quick marching tramp of footsteps, let Heron know easily what all this meant. The cool night air from the Tower battlements had blown in through the crevices left by a pile of cannon shot upon his face. Light, more subtle still, from the little oil lamp had shone throngh those same interstices into the eyes of a sentinel of the Connaught Rangers, then on his post That was the explanation. Those cannon balls alone were between Captain Heron and tbe open air. \" And it's out tou want?\" \" I do indeed I\" \" Then it's out you won't get noway anyhow till I call the guard !\" \"Oh, Dennis!\" \" What now, you divil?\" \"For the love of God, and all your hopes oi s. me day being happy with your own dear Judy McCrae, help me!\" Dennis whistled- \"It's meself will see what the likes ov you looks like. But are you sure you ain't a sparry natural bean' ?\" \"A what?\" \" A Fan Tom ! \" \" A what, Dennis ?\" \" Bedad, an' you don't know lamed ways ! Do say, ghost, are you a ghost? They say tbat Saint Patrick built the ould Tower, and drowned Julius C\u00e6sar in a cask ov whiskey, all bekase he winked at Lady Jane Grey, the youngest child of tbat thief ov the world, Oliver Cromwell. Yon are after seeing I know history, any way!\" \" You do indeed, Dennis 1\" \" You give way to that ?\" \"Oh, jesl\" \" And you are a Christian?\" \"I am indeed!\" \" And not a hathen ghost?\" \" Quite the contrary, Dennis, I assure you ; and if you should happen to want your discharge from the army, I will give you the money to buy it \" \"You will?\" Oh, how he longed to breathe that open air in aU its freedom ! Was it possible for him to remove the cannon balls ? He cast down the stairs the now useless lamp, and put both his hands to the wooden frame on which the balls resied. \" On my honour!\" \" Thin, bedad, by this and by that, an' here goes with a will. It's more nor a good hour till tbe relief comes, and it's lashings and lavings ov time we have forenent us.\" Dennis did set to work with a will, rolling aside the cannon b-Uls. He slightly moved it There was a rolling, rattling sound, and the balls began to faU from the pyramid which they made. \" Murder and bad luck ! \" cried Dennis. \" It's the ghost of ould Richard the Tenth, and all the blessed martyrs of the ould Tower that's coming !

He resolved upon a bold effort for freedom, or at aU events to make CHAPTER XCV. FELIX HERON ESCAPES FROM THE TOWFR. ANT> FINDS OLD FRIENDS WAITING FOR HIM. In about five minntes Captain Heron was able to push aside the wooden framework, and clamber out of the uncomfortable place he was in to tho open air. A thick rain had begun to fall, and the sky was too thickly encased in clouds for the least glimpse of moonlight to show itself. \" A thousand thanks to you, my good fellow !\" said Heron, when he fairly 6tood ou the battle ments of the Tower; \" I owe you a great fa vot-u I\"* it better. \" Dennis O'Flaherty !

Don't you hear thim ?\" \" I do. Will you come back here as soon as you get from the relief party ?\" \" By this aud by that I wUl, your honour !\" The measured tramp of the sergeant's guard changing the sentinels came now plainly upon the ears of Felix Heron, and he crouched down close in the shadow of the bastion near which Dennis stood at \" attention.\" \"Halt! Right face!\" The guard stopped. \" All well, sentry ?\" \" Yes, sergeant.\" \" Change guard, Number Twenty-six \" Number Twenty-six and Dennis, with their muskets at the slope, exchanged those most m.s terious whispers that take place between the old and the new sentry, and then Dennis feU in with the relief, and marched away. The new sentry was a tall, bulky man, and the first thing he did was to put his musket into the sentry-box with a hearty curse, and then to light a short pipe. Felix Heron listened to the retreating footsteps of the guard, until distance obliterated the sound. Then somebody touched him on the shoulder. \" Whisht !\" \" I tould your honour.\" \" No.\" \" 1 did ! By this and by that, I did, or else I left that part out. It was the justice they tock me afore, ' aud,' says he, 'Dennis,' says he, 'there ain't enough to hang you,' says he; ' but if you would go for a soger,' says he \u2014 ' I won't,' says I \u2014 ' I'll commit yoo,' eays he, ' \u00aen suspicion of innocent recrimination and partitioucipation,' eays he, ' in a robbery,' says he.

'Yes,' says I ; and here I am, all owing to recriminating anybody, and partition cipating in nothing at all at all !\" \" Well, Dennis, nuder these circumstances, if you dislike the army, I should say, leave it\" \"Lave it?\" \" Dennis ?\" \" That same, your honour !\" \" You have been quick ?\" \" Thrue for you.

With those and the cap Felix Heron was in a few minutes effectually disguised at that hour of thi morning, although in the broad light of day he would not have been able to stand any scrutiny. Dennis shook his head. \" It's meself that don't know that same ; but"], [260, "254 EDITH HERON. A gleam of morning light shot over the face of the whole Tower. Daisy saw her master. With two bounds she was by the side of Heron, and he was iu the saddle ou tha instant The new day had come. A cool, delicious breeze sprung, up and dissi pated the slight rain which was up to that time falling, and then the drams beat the morning call. \" Bedad,\" said Dennis, \" and it's time now ! Come on, your honour, and let's be off!\" Captain Heron was willing enough ; and, led by Dennis, they made their way down from tha battlements to the Tower green, and thence to the Lion Tower and gateway that led to old Tower Hill. \" Up, Dennis, up ! my horse will carry double for a good five miles, and never feel it. After that, you must walk, if you were the King of England!\" \" Can you ride ?\" said Ogle to Dennis. \"Ov coorse!\" \" That's a good thing.\" \" I never tried, but I have got all the detarmi nation.\" Ogle gave Dennis what is called a \"leg up,\" but it was too muoh of a leg up, and over he went on the other side of Daisy. \" Murder and blazes, what do you mane ? It's kilt I am entirely. Why ain't stones made a trifle softer, any way ?\" \" Quick, or I must be off !\" oried Heron. The morning brightened each moment Felix Heron endured more real and nervous anxiety during the walk to the gate than all the impediments had hitherto caused him. A grim, elderly warder was oo duty at the postern. \" Eogh!\" he granted. \" You are in a won derful hurry, both of yon!\" \" True for you !\" replied Dennis. \" Can't yon get drink at your own canteen \u2014 eh ? Ay, and tobacco too ?\" \" True for yon again ; but the thief ov the world that keeps the canteen has been bumping the measures into mighty big bumps iu the inside till the quart houlds half a pint and a quarter, bad luck to the tikes ov him I\" Up went Dennis again, aud this time he man aged to hold on. \" Halt ! Make ready ! Present !\" cried the ser geant in command of the party that had issued from the postern gate of the Tower. Heron touohed Daisy with his knee. \" Off \u2014off and away ! Away, like the wind, my Daisy !\" \" Fire !\" There was a rattle of musketry that awakened everybody within a quarter or half a mile of Tower Hill. \" Oh, that's it, is it? Ha ! ha I Well you can pass out!\" Another moment and Captain Heron was npon Tower Hill. But Heron was safe. It is not too much to say that he owed his safety to two little incidents. In the first place, one-half of the serg9U 's guard purposely fired over the heads of Daisy, Heron, and Dennis. The other half that did fire at them, en .nred their safety by so doin?, for their muskets were, of course, of the old Brown Bess fashion, which were only dangerous to people who were not aimed at. A man darted out of a doorway at the corner of Thames Street, and held np both hands. In one of them was a horse's bridle. The man was Ogle. A drum began to beat a furious call in the Tower. Bang went a musket from the battlements. Dennis screwed up his mouth to the form of whistling, but no whistle came forth. \" It's found out, in two ways, anyhow, yonr honour !\" Heron was gone. Tower Hill was speedily left far behind. Ogle made his way again into the marine store dealer's, and, addressing a Jew boy who was there, said, \" In all right aud reason, the Captain will redeem all my promises to your father, for tbe care and shelter of Daisy.\" \" He may come every day if he likes,\" said the boy. \"Reuben! Reuben!\" \" Yes, Jacob 1\" \" Go on to Tower Hill and see if you can find any of the bullets. Lead is three pounds a penny.\" Reuben, who was a yonng urchin of about five summers, went out on his economical errand, aud Ogle laughed as he strolled into the back parlour of the marine store dealer, who, like many of his brethren of the present day, was not particular whether as regards what he dealt in or where it came from. \" That is an alarm, Ogle !\" \" Yes, Oaptain !\" \" Murder and hot pitaties, who's this?\" \" A friend of mine!\" \" Of yours ?\" \" Yes ; and so a friend likewise of yours ! We will escape together or fall together!\" \" Amin !\" \" Ogle, I can gness by that bridle that next to you, my best friend, when 1 am in want of help, is at hand.\" \" Yes, Captain, Daisy is in that shop yonder. I thought it possible she might be wanted.\" \" Never more so I\" The drums beat furiously in the Tower. The gate through whioh Heron and Dennis had passed, was first closed and then sharply opened, and several of the warders, in their curious and antiquated costumes, with their long halberts on their shoulders, looked irresolutely out They could hardly be said to know exactly what the nature of the alarm was as yet Bnt that was a state of ignorance that did not last many seconds. Just as Ogle had ran back to a marine store dealer's shop, and from the back parlour brought out Daisy, the postern gate was oleared of the wardens, and a sergeant's guard of the Connaught Rangers slipped hurriedly out Captiin Heron had ran after Ogle in the direc tion he went, and Dennis had followed Heron. Daisy flew rather than galloped nntil a bard three miles were achieved, aud then in a beautiful and shadowy lane, in which the birds were singing their morning song, Heron drew rein. \" Woa \u2014 woa, Daisy I\" Daisy stopped. \" Now, Dennis, as there is no pursuit, you can get down.\" \"Down is it?\" \" Yes, down.\" \" Iv it's all the same to yon, it's just used to it I'm after getting.\" \" Daisy, he won't get down \""], [261, "EDITH HERON. 255 Daisy flung out her heels, and seemed as though the great object of her existence just then was to stand on her head. \"Murder! Murder! Blazes and scalding hot pit\u2014 a\u2014 ties. Ooh, the divU!\" Dennis was sitting comfortably on a mud heap by the side of the lane. \" Come, come,\" said Heron, \" I'm quite sure you are not hurt.\" \" Then, I tell you what it is, Dennis, I must ride on, but you can follow ; and if you cannot find your way without doing so, ask your route to Epping Forest, and when you get there, walk boldly among the trees, and cry out, ' Hawks and Herons !' \" \" But, sir \" Felix Hereu was well aware that Dennis wonld keep him in an eternal argument if he delayed another moment, so he shook the bridle of Daisy, and off he went \" Bedad, thin, I don't know.\" \" If yon don't know you may take it for granted you are all right And now, Dennis, il you like to come with me I can give yen a hearty welcome, and if you would like to have fifty pounds iu money it shall be left for you anywhere you please to-morrow night in London.\" \" Is it far ? \" The last he saw of Dennis was, that, after get ting on a bank, and then on a stile on the top of it, and then into a dwarf tree to look after him, he was waving his cap to get him to stop. But Heron made what speed now he could, and was soon amid the leafy glades of old Epping Forest. \" Where to ? \" \" With you ? \" \" Only abont five miles more.\" \" Then it's meself that will go wid you if you have no sort of objection.\" \" None in the least ; but you must march, Dennis.\" \" Whoop !\" cried a voice. Tom Ripon dropped from a tree. \" Ah, Tom !\" \" All's right, Captain ! Ogle said he wonld be sure to be able to do something with Daisy. Oh, don't !\" \" Wid all the aise and pleasure in life. Do you think I'd trust myself again on tho likes of that creature ? Oh, no ! Murder and hot pitaties, no ! I'U take the march, and perhaps we may fall in with some breakfast some of these days. Daisy, as usual, had snatched Tom's hat from his head and held it in her teeth, aud, as usual, some of Tom's hair came with it. \" Don't now, Daisy \u2014 don't ! She's always a doing that, Captain.\" Daisy let drop Tom's cap, and then toot hold of him by the arm, but so gently that she did not hurt him in the least CHAPTER XCVI. That was Daisy's way of leading Tom to the stable. CAPTAIN HERON ASSUMES A NEW CHARACTER, AND TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP IN LIFE \" Is all well ?\" asked Heron, eagerly, as he dis mounted. \" Oh, yes, Captain.\" \" Thank heaven ! My Edith, then, has been spared even the anxiety of knowing that I was in danger?\" \" Oh, yes, Captain.\" \" Well, Tom, take Daisy to the stable you and I have made so comfortable for her. Ogle wUl soon get here, no donbt.\" \"All right, Captain!\" \" And tell the scouts that a man wiU come into the wood, iu the dress of a foot soldier. He wiU cry out, ' Hawks and herons !' and is a friend of mine.\" Captain Heron would fain have gaUoped with Daisy to Epping Forest Edith might possibly have heard of his arrival, and if so every hour of anxiety that she endured was a misery to be avoided by any possible means. But Heron shrank from deserting the Irish soldier who had nobly kept faith with him, and been of essential service to him. But for Dennis, he never could have escaped from the Tower with the facility he had succeeded in so doing ; and anythiDg in the shape of opposi tion on the part of Dennis must have ended in his utter and complete discomfiture. Every reason, therefore, had Felix Heron to be grateful to the Connaught Ringer, and he could not make np his mind, even for Edith's sake, to ride away from him. WeU he knew that Edith herself would be the first person to condemn any such proceeding. But was there no other resource ? \" I'll take care of him, Captain ! Come on, Da:sy, do; and don't be pulling, now !\" Heron was about to plunge into one of the thickest parts of the old forest, when Tom called out to him, \" Oh, Captain I \u2014 Oaptain 1\" \" What, Tom?\" \" It's a boy ?\" \" What?\" Surely, yes. \" Dennis,\" said Heron, after they had gone on another half mile.\" \" Your honour ?\" \" It's a boy ; and Mrs. Ogle says it's quite a beauty, and that Lady Edith ts as well as can be expected !\" Heron staggered, and fiearly feU. A faint feel ing came over him. \" Good heavens, Tom. what do you mean ?\" \" That's all, Captaw I* \"All\u2014 all? What Is all?\" \" Do you know Epping Forest ?\" \"Epping Forest?\" \" Yes.\" \" If I saw him, I might know him, yonr honour.\" \" It's a place, Dennis, not a person.\" \" A place ? He's got a place, his ha ?\" \" No, no, no ! Do you know what a forest is \u2014 a wood, you know ?\" \" Sergeant Wood, of the Rangers ?\" \" Dennis, I don't know if you are stupid, or only pretending.\" \" That's just the state of mind I'm always in, your honour \" \" Just that Mrs. Ogle came to me and told me it wa9 a boy, and that it was a beauty, and that Lady Edith wao as well as conld be expected.'\" Oaptain Heron did not wait to hear what more Tom Ripon had to say upon so melancholy a subject, but with a strange cry, half a sob, and half thanksgiving to heaven, he dashed down one of the narrow secret paths of old Epping towards the ruins of the Priory. Oh, how he blessed the happy chance that had"], [262, "256 EDITH HERON. liberated him from the Tower, and enabled him to hear such tidiDgs beneath the shady trees of the forest instead of having them brought to him in some dreary dungeon of the old fortress. Dashing aside the brambles and the wild rose bushes that were in his path, Heron reached that portion of the ruins of Hinohcliffe Priory which formed a safe home for his much-loved Edith. tree-tops down on to tbe plains, and all Nature was awakening, Ogle met the whole of the band, with the exception of the four who were on duty as scouts. Tom Ripon was present The Reverend Mortification Ripon, as he still chose to name himself, was there. An odd-looking personage, too, in a torn and faded military uniform was present. That was Dennis O'Flaherty, of the Connaught Rangers, who had duly arrived at the forest, after many perils, and many hair-breadth escapes. Ogle looked cautiously about him ; and when he saw that all were there that he expected, he spoke in low, but distinct, tones. \" Comrades all ! There are two wolves in the forest! You know who I mean well enough. They are not the animals, so named, who walk or ran upon four legs; but human wolves, who know no touch of pity or generosity, or of common justice.\" \" Irish wolves !\" said Dennis. \" They would eat the pitaties out ov your mouth. In Tipperary, once upon a time, I \" \" Silence !\" Her name was on his lips, but a second thought warned him not to utter it He paused and trembled with perhaps causeless apprehension of the possibly injurious effect of his too sudden approach npon Edith. Then he heard a footstep approaohing him, and a voice called out \u2014 \" Tom ! Tom I Tom !\" Heron did not reply. The voice was Mrs Ogle's. He tortured him self to decide upon whether the voice sounded in tones of apprehension or not \" Tom ! where are you, you little ruffian ? You must go to Woodfordand get the things that Lady Edith has written down on this paper!\" Heron spoke. \" Mrs. Ogle !\" \"Oh, gracious! It's the Cap'ain !\" \" Edith ? Is she well ?\" Dennis received a tap on the head from one of the band, and Ogle proceeded. \" We might knock over both these wolves in human shape, if we liked, but it's much better to let one of them dispose of the other.\" \" In Tipperary, once upon \" began Dennis. Another tap on the head bronght him to si lence. \" Quite as well as oan be expected, and the little boy is a beauty.\" t Those were Tom's words. Then came a chok ing sensation to the throat of Felix Heron. He could not speak Tears were in his eyes, and he tasted of one of those rare moments of felicity which fall to the lot of humanity bnt twice or thrice in a life. \" If, therefore,\" continued Ogle, \" you all keep in the same mind about Jonathan Wild, hold np your hands.\" Every hand was held up. \" Then,\" added Ogle, \" it can be done this very day.\" \" In Tipperary, once \" \" Yea ! wilt thou, as the Psalmist says, be dumb as a stock-fish ?\" said the Riverend Mortification, as this time it was he who dealt Dennis the admo nitory crack on the head. In five minutes more he had left a kiss of fond affection upon the lips of his Edith, aud he held in his arms the living pledge of their love. CHAPTER XCVII. OGLE GETS LEAVR OF AB8ENCE, AND MAKES PREPARATIONS FOR WILDS EXECUTION. \" Tbis is Monday,\" said Ogle. \" Hanging day !\" cried two or three voices at \" Captain !\" said Ogle, at au early hour on thc following morning, \u2014 \" Captain I You won't leave the forest now, for some time?\" \" No, Ogle.\" \" Then, I and the men, all but the scouts, can have a day's leave ?\" \" Oh, yes, yes !\" Felix Heron ought to have been a little sus picious that something very peculiar was on the tapis by the speed with which Ogle left him Perhaps, under any other than the present cir cumstances, when, like a young father, with his first-bom, he was already looking forward to the far-off future of the boy that slept upon the bretst of bis Edith, he would have recollected that there was some scheme afloat in regard to Jonathan Wild. once \" I hope so, comrades, so far as regards the uuparaUeled scoundrel we have now iu our pos session. Is it agreed that we shall run all our risks, and take Jonathan Wild to Tyburn, and hang him?\" \" Agreed! aereed!\" \" Then, if I live, I will see it done. Tom Ripon, have you done what I asked you, last night ?\" \" Oh, yes, Ogle. I went to the vUIage, and bought a cart and a horse for the thirty guineas you gave me, and they are both now in the little copse by the old sycamores, where the horse has been having au early breakfast.\" \" Good ! Now, comrades all, I have leave from the Captain that we may all go on a day's plea sure, so let us set about it\" But he eould think of nothing \u2014 recollect nothing \u2014 dream of nothing but of his own dear, dear Edith, and the little dimpled darling who, in due time, would caU him father. We will now, however, follow Ogle to a shadowy part of the old forest of Epping, where a storm had cast down some ancient trees, which had torn up mounds of earth, with their deep-set roots. Those torn-up mounds had left cavities in the earth, so that the spot was one of the wildest and B-ost irregular in all Epping Forest Tc a. just as the sun began to creep from the \" Hurrah ! hurrah !\" Ogle had held up his finger to enjoin silence, so that these hurrahs were given in such an odd subdued kind of way, that any one who could have been permitted near enough to hear them in the depths of the wood, might have fancied they were bnt tbe echoes of some distant rejoicing. Dennis O'Flaherty was the only sadly puzzled person present \" Bedad, then, and what's up?\" he asked. \" Hash !\""], [263, "EDITH HERON. 257 \" But what is it?\" \" That will I ; only before I go I want to tell vou something.\" '\u2022What is it?\" \" Hush !\" \"If it's divarsion, don't be after laving this mother's son out ov it.\" \"Hem! Listen, boys! In Tipperary, once upon a \" \"No, no! We won't hear that!\" cried every body,and Dennis was again silenced; buthemut tered to himself, \"Now was ever the likes ov tbat same? They won't, by this, and by that, bear what happened in Tipperary once upon a time.\" \" Come, Tom, the cart \u2014 here, quick !\" cried Ogle. \" All's right !\" Tom started off in one direction while four of the band started in other two directions \u2014 a couple each way ; and just as Tom brought the Iihrse and cart as near as they could without getting tbe wheels into a rut, the four members of the band came back with their prisoners. \"You had much better stay where you are, Dennis,\" said Ogle. \" Wo are going to Tyburn, to see a fellow turned off. that's all ; so, you see. it's more business than pleasure.\" \" What's the fellow ? Indeed, thin, if it's a bad fellow, it's meeself would like to go and see that same.\" \" It's an old friend of yours.\" \" A friend?\" \"Well, I ought not to call him a friend, per haps, Dennis. It's Jonathan Wild !\" \"Whoop! Won't I go!\" \"You shall, then, Dennis; but you must make a change in your dress, so that you may be effectually concealed. We have au endless variety of all sorts of clothing in the wood, from which you can suit yourself.\" Jonathan Wild. The treacherous spy who had posted the bills upon the trees.

Before they got wall clear, however, of the outskirts of ihe wood, Dennis begged to be let into the cart, as he didn't use to ride on the outside of a horse. Wild had his arms tightly pinioned behind him, and he looked savage and cadaverous. The spy was downcast, bnt he had not the the same look of fear that was about the eye of Jonathan Wild. \" Very well,\" said Ogle. \" You drive the cart then, Dennis, and the whole affair wUl look better still.\" There were already two l\u00abd horses, \u2014 one for the Rev. Mortification, and one in case of any accident in the cavalcade, and this one of Dennis's made three ; bnt Ogle thought they might be useful, and, as things turned out, they were emi nently so. \" Dp with him!\" said Ogle. \" What farce is this ?\" said Wild. \" I offer five hundred pounds for my liberty. You won't make so much any other way !\" Wild was, with very little more ceremony than if he had been a bundle of faggots from the forest, pitched into the cart, at the bottom of which there was some half-mouldy straw. Ogle then laid his hand on the shoulder of the convicted spy. \" You want to live ?\" The cart had quite a professional and pictu resque look. Jonathan Wild bound, and sitting down in the straw. \" Of oourse I do !\" Dtnnis, with a suit of clothes a great deal toe big for him, driving- \" Then your only way will be to play the part set down for you as well as you can, for by the heaven above us, if I see the least disposition on your part to act falsely, I wUl blow your brains out witbont tbe least compunction I\" As he spoke, Ogle carefully shook upthe priming cf one of his pistols. l' I'll do it !\" said the spy, doggedly. He got into the cart He cast a ferocious glance at Jonathan WUd as be took from his pocket a red night-cap, and put it on. The Reverend Mortification, with his long, awkwark-shaped form, singing a psalm ; and the spy with his red night- cap. Ogle lode on in advance, with a constable's sti.ff in his hand. Captain Heron and his men had captured too many of those symbols of authority not to have one always ac hand for any purpose required. Winding their way along a narrow lane, the cavalcade oame to the little village of Green ford. \" Now, Mr. Wild,\" ha said, \" I look something Uke the real thing, don't I ?\" \" What real thing ?\" \" A hangman ! \" Wild juddered. The hour was too early for any one to take any particular notice of them, and they got into the high-road to London without interruption. Ogle's wish and obj-ct was to skirt tha metro polis to the north, and so drop down upon tho noper part of the Oxford Road without the necessity of traversing any of the great thoroughfares, so that the circuit taken brought them over Hogsden Fields, and by Pentonville. It was past eleven o'clock, and what the watch men would have called \" a cloudy morning,\" when the cavalcade reached fairly the suburbs of London. The possibility that Ogle and bis comrades might by their audacity succeed in hanging him at Tyburn seemed to come strongly over the mind of Jonathan. Tbat anything or everything in the world was to be accomptished by sheer impudence and deter mination, Wild was, in his heart, if he had such an article, fully convinced of. If, therefore, Ogle had made up his mind to hang Mr. Wild at Tyburn, he might do- it within the next three or four hours. Wild, op to that period, had not seemed to en tertain any ideas of escape from the peril in which he stood. \" Ogle,\" he said, \" I have something to say.\" He turned a shade yellower. \" It's past the time, and not the time yet,\" re plied Ogle. \" What do you mean by that ? You speak in riddles.\" But when he saw caTts, coaches, and passen gers, a new spirit teemed to rise up in his brain. He scramhled to his feet Ogle was by the side of the cart in a mo ment. \" Not at all, Jonathan Wild. You are sentenced ; so that it is past the time for you to 6peak. When you get to the gallows it will be time for you to bottle your last words before you are hurried off.\" \" Oh, stuff, stuff I Come now, I will enter into an undertaking never again, by word or deed, to interfere with Captain Felix Heron.\" \"Of course you will!\" \" On my oath \" \" Exactly ; and in order tbat you may keep your word, the security we mean to take is death ! \" Wild turned yellower etilL \"Forward!\" cried Ogle. From various leafy recesses the horses of the little party had been brought forward, and the Rev. Mortification having mounted into the cart, likewise the spy, who was to play the part of hangman, was told to officiate as driver, and the cavalcade started \u2022 \"Jonathan Wild, take jour choice.\" \" What choice ?\" \" To be shot here or hanged at Tyburn.\" Wild looked morosely savage. \"Yes,\" added Ogle, \"if you prefer it, I will shoot you here, and leave you in the cart, and we will all ride back to the forest, or you may go on and be hung at Tyburn.\" Wild looked iu Ogle's face, and then he mad. up his mind in a moment. There was no such thing as doubting or mis taking that Ogle fairly and truly meant what he said. While there was life there was hope. To be shot there and then would extinguish that hope and that life together; while to go on towards Tyburn would be to give him, at all events. aU the chances of the next hour or two. Wild sat down again. Ogle put up the pistol he had taken from the holster. The whole party only c insisted of nine of Captain Heron's men, besides Ogle, Tom Ripon, and the Rev. Mortification, and Dennis O'Flaherty, who had been hastily stripped of his soldier's clothes, and accommodated with a horse. Tom Ripon rode up to Ogle. \" I say, Mr. Ogle, I have an idea.\" \" What is it, Tom ?\""], [265, "EDITH HERON. 259 \"I want 10 know what's the price of a coffin.\" \" A what ?\" of what Wild called a farce, but which he, Ogle, had determined should be a tragedy. \" Halt !\" \" A coffin. It would look so nice, and so plea sant, and so natural, to have one in the cart for Johnny WUd to sit upon\u2014 wouldn't it now, eh ?\" Ogle smiled. \" It would oertainly, Tom, form part of the scenio effect Take these five guineas, and trot on and see about it\" The cart stopped. \" Mortification, a word with you !\" The Rev. Mortification bent bis long body over the side cf the cart to speak to Ogle. \" You see that chapel yonder, in the fields. Get out and mount your horse. Tom will go with you. It is absolutely necessary that you borrow a black gown, to look like a clergyman.\" \" Yea, I wiU, as the Psalmist says. Yea \" \" Never mind \u2014 be off. Tom.\" \" With all my heart,\" said Tom. Now Tom had passed several undertakers, and he had no donbt of passing others. Indeed, be fore he had got a couple of hundred yards in advance of Ogle, he came to ashop where fune rals were \" performed.\" \" Hoy !\" oried Tom Ripon, as he drove up at the door, and culled out to a man within, who was mating that tap-tap tapping sound incidental to coffin and trunk-making. \"Yes. What is it. my little mtc?\" Tom was deeply offended. \" You are a donkey. But I want to kn^\u00abr if you have a coffin ready-made, and what's the price of it ? \" Oh, yes, lots. Two guineas. What's the size of the party ?\" \" Never mind about that. Any one will do. Bring it out There, put it into tbat cart.\" Wild uttered a howl ; but Ogle again showed him tbe pistol, and he only bit his lip till it bled. The drops of blood on his yeUow skip made him look worse than ever. \" Yes, Ogle.\" \" Go with Mortification. He wUl teU you what for.\" \"Help! help!\" yelled Jonathan WUd. \"Help! Murder! murder! murder! Help! hei \" Ogle had him by the throat \"Gag him!\" A couple of the band set to work upon Wild. A cork, with a piece of string run through it \u2014 a species of gag which they always had in th-ir pockets, and which many a time saved a life by stopping an unruly tongue \u2014 was clapped into his mouth and tied behind his head. Jonathan might half choke himself in efforts to shout, but that was all he could do. \" The night-cap !\" cried Ogle. \" Who has a white night-cap?\" \" I !\" said the spy, who seemed to have taken a malicious pleasure in being provided with any thing necessary to the execution of WUd, since lhat was the condition of his own escape from death. Tbe coffin was hoisted into the cart, and Wild was forced to sit upon it, as there was no room otherwise. \" This.\" he said, \" is carrying a joke too far \u2014 too far !\" An ordinary white cotton cap was dragged over Jonathan's head and ears, and half-tray down his face, so that he could hardly see. A shouting noise was at that moment heard in the direction of the little chapel to which Tom Ripon and the Rev. Mortification had gone. A man in scarlet velveteen continuations, and without his coat, was pursuing Tom and Mor.ifi ficatien. Nnbody replied to him. \" Come, come, all of yon ; it is time v.e pnt an end to this little farce, and all turn in some- where to a capital breakfast, at my expense.\" StiU nobody replied. Jonathan Wild might have been assorted by a party of speetres, for ail the good he got by speak- ing to them. People paused in the streets, and ran out of shops, to look at them. A throng of boys, and idlers of more mature years, began to follow the party, wondering what had brought a \" hanging\" in that direction. The sight, however, of Ogle, with the gilt constable's staff he carried, put an end to any- thing in the shape of interference. It was a fact, although a wonderful one, that the whole of that portion of the suburbs of Lonion was traversed without any attempt at stopping the progress of the party. It was half-past twelve o'clock when Ogle came in sight of Tyburn Gate. He came to it by PaddingtoB way, then a gloomy cut-throat sort of district, where land was cheaper by the acre than it is now by the foot. A large crowd was at and about the old gate and Tyburn Tree. It was hanging day. Never a Monday passed over at that time, during the Old Bailey sessions, that one or more unfortunate wretch was not swung off into eter nity on that spot. Ogle spurred forward and presented a pistol. The man in the scarlet velveteens at once flung himself down, and roaring Uke a bull, roUed over and over. \" Who on earth is that ?\" said Ogle. \"Yea, the beadle!\" \" What an extraordinary fellow ! There he goes into a ditch 1\" Tom Ripon laughed \" He was up in the pulpit of the chapel, Ogle and he wouldn't listen to us; so we went an. helped ourselves in the vestry, and then he rai after us, as you saw.\" \" Yea, though I have the gown, and, yea, th\u00ab bands likewise, as the Psalmist says \" \" Never mind!\" oried Ogle. \"Cjmeon! Get into the cart again, Mortification. By Jove! I think wa look the right sort of thing, now !\" \" Bather !\" said Tom. \" The Sheriff himself, if he is here, wUl be puzzled.\" In five minutes more, Ogle, and the cart, and tho band of Captain Heron, came fairly into sight of the crowd about Tyburn Tree- \" We are seen !\" said Ogle. \" Keep close, and let nobody speak ! I wUl answer all questions ! Close round the cart!\" A mau on horseback, with top-boots and red waistcoat, galloped out of the crowd about Tyburs Tree, and rode up to Ogle- \" What in the name of Hem ! Well, ii_ no use swearing I Bus -vho are you ?\" The crowd there now was either in anticipa tion of an execution, or actually witnessing one. The gallows was quite plainly to be seen over )he heads of the spectators, and Ogle galloped back to the cart which he had preceded, with a .etermination to lose no time in getting to the end"], [266, "260 EDITH HERO\"... \" Chief officer of Forest-cum-Epping Gaol, sir.\" \" Who are you ?\" \" Brett, head-turnkey of Newgate.\" \" Very good !\" \"But \u2014 bnt\u2014 what\u2014 who Eh? Good gra cious ! am I out of my senses ?\" \" I don't know.\" many things in the process of his carrying out this adventure, but to none had he made np bis mind so very completely as that he would not le.ve Jonathan Wild for a moment in the hands of any but his.own party. He had no faith in the spy. That rascal might turn treacherous at any mo- \" What \u2014 what is the meaning of it aU ?\" \"Oh ! in the cart?\" ment. \" Well,\" said Brett, \" there's the Sheriff's coach by the tree yonder.\" \" Mr. Thomas,\" said Ogle. \" Yes, sir ?\" said Tom Ripon. \" You aro the judge's junior clerk, and have tbe warrant\" \" Yes, in the cart\" \" Ah ! that is the notorious pirate, highway man, burglar, and maB-?layer, Lowman Coombe, who has been convicted at tbe assizes of Forest cum-Epping, and ordered to be brought to old Tybnrn, and hung.\" \" No ?\" Tom took the hint that these words conveyed sufficiently to say \" Yes, sir,\" again. \" Go, then, to his worship the Sheriff, and show it to him. I am under promise not to leave the criminal.\" \" Yes ; I have the warrant signed by the cir cuit judges.\" Mr. Brett looked confounded. All that Ogle was saying was decidedly outside his experiences. and he could not make it ont Yet there was a cool, c.lm coherence about the words of Ogle that had all its effect upon him. \" Confound me if I can make it out !\" he cried. \"You had better come and speak to the Sheriff.\" \" Very good.\" \" I only wish Mr. Wild was here ; he would Boon know something about it\" \" He does,\" said Ogle. \" Jonathan Wild knows all about it. The whole affair has been com municated to him.\" Tom trotted off The Sheriff was in a half doze in his coach He did not like hangings at aU, and he had no inclination to see them \u2014 but then he was oh duty, and he took it as easy as he could. A procession from Newgate was coming \u2014 it had come, in fact \u2014 to the very top of the Oxford Road, and the crowd, with a shout, welcomed another cart \u2014 another clergyman \u2014 another hangman \u2014 another coffin, and another criminal, just as Tom reached the Sheriff's carriage. A pang shot through the heart cf Ogle as he saw that the real convicted prisoner, who came in the death cart from Newgate to be strangled at Tyburn, was a young girl. \" What has she done, Mr. Brett?\" asked Ogle, anxiously. \"Oh, that girl?\" \"Yes, yes!\" \" Why, let me see. Oh, it's a case of shop lifting. They say that she took a yard of ribbon from a mercer's counter. She says she didn't and that it clung in some way to her sleeve by the edge. However, she is convicted, and is to suffer here\" \" Oh, has it ?\" \" I assure you it has.\" Wild kicked, and plunged, and made frantic efforts to speak. The spy gave the cotton night-cap a hitch that brought it right down to the end of his nose \" He seems a dangerous and ugly ruffian,\" said Mr. Brett \" He is, indeed !\" \" Well, if ihe Sheriff sees no objection, and your warrant is all right, he can be turned off here. Ha, ha ! It's abont the rummest go I ever heard of, to bring a fellow from the country in a cart in this sort of way; and I'll be hanged if I know where the place is either.\" \" You see it's aU right, though,\" said Ogle ; \" so you wUl be good enough to clear the way for us.\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 oh, yes !\" Wild made an effort to attract the notice of Brett by uttering unearthly growls ; but the latter, although quite an acquaintance, never suspected his identity, but aggravated Wild nearly to mad ness by poking him in the back with the handle of his riding-whip, as he said, \" You may as well be quiet, my man ; you are in for it, and yon will swing, I take it, and no mistake.\" \" Certainly 1\" said Ogle. \" I mean to take care there is no mistake abont that\" \" No, by G\u2014 !\" \" Eh ?\" \" Did you speak, sir?\" \" No; but I thought you said ' No, by G\u2014 ! ' \" Ogle shook his head. He had said it, and the expression had burst from his lips at unawares. It was like a ray of sunshine to the heart of Ogle to say to himself, \" What, if by courage\u2014 by audacity, I can succeed in saving that young girl, as well as in ridding society of the monster Wild !\" \" But, Mr. Brett, the doubt ought to have saved her.\" \" Perhaps so; but Mr. Wild, you see, knew her, and he came forward and said she was a known thief, and that did the business.\" \" And was she?\" \"I don't know. She denied it; bnt she will suffer.\" The young girl was completely prostrated by the horrors of her situation. She was sitting on the coffin in the cart wilh her hands clasped over her face, while the chaplain was nndging her by the shoulder, and in vain trying to attract her attention. CHAPTER XCVIII. OGLE AND THE BAND ARE ACTORS AT A DEEPLY rNZBRESTISQ SCENE AT TYBURN. \" Make way, there \u2014 make way, there ! Clear the way \u2014 clear out I\" shonted Mr. Brett as he rode through the crowd, making a lane for Ogle and the cart containing Jonathan WUd. \" I'll take care of your man, while you go and speak to the Sheriff,'' said Brett \" Ob, thank you!\" Now Ogle had made up his mind to a good It was a terrible sight WhUe this little episode was proceeding, Tom Ripon had reached the Sheriff's coach. Tom rapped at the glass, and the Sherff started awake. \" Eh ? Is it all over ?\""], [267, "EDITH HERON. 261 \"No: you old wimp,\" said Tom. \"How do you find j ourself, eh ?\" \" You impertinent young scoundrel !\" Oh, don't be in a passion ! I want to know if it's all right that's all ? Bye, bye, old porpoise ; go to sleep again I\" Now Tom had divined pretty weU that all be was wanted to do was to seem to have some official communication with the Sheriff, and that was the way he did it. Leaving that personage in a great state of rage, Tom rode back. \" Oh, very well !\" It was strange to see the two carts now con verging towards the gallows \u2014 to Tyburn Tree, as it was called. Through lanes made by the crowd on either side, the two vehicles made their progress, and each moment they came nearer and nearer to each other. The Ordinary of Newgate, in the cart with the young girl, now and then urged her to confess ; and now aud then he cast a look of not the most pleased scrutiny at the Reverend Mortification Ripon in the cart with Jonathan Wild. Perhaps Mortification did not cut a very re spectable figure. It so happened that the gown which he and Tom had taken from the little suburban church, in defiance of the beadle, was made for a short podgy man. \" It's aU right, sir!\" \"Oh, very well,\" said Brett; \"they can both swing together!\" A shriek so terrible and heartrending, that it made Ogle nearly fall off his horse, and elicited a horrible groan from the mob, came from the lips of the convicted young girl. The executioner, seeing that the efforts of the Ordinary of Newgate were all in vain to rouse her, had forcibly lifted her up, and torn her hands from before her face. The Reverend Mortification, on the contrary, was long and lean. The gown came to abont half-way down to his knees, and bad a very absurd appearance. Ogle could have laughed at any other time ; but now every energy and every nerve were wound up to a pitch of intense and serious excitement He wanted to hang Wild. He wanted to save the young girl, who had swooned. She had had her first look at the gaUows ! What an awful look was that ! No wonder that it froze the life-blood, for a moment, around the heart of that young girl ; and then as nature would assert her vital sway, and the ensanguined fluid sought its accustomed chan nels, the vexed and desolate spirit gave utterance to its agony in that one fearful shriek. To tbat condemned one, and, as it afterwards appeared, wholly innocent creature, hope and mercy seemed alike to have deserted her and the world. Both were services of imminent danger. But he made np his mind that both should be done. The cart came nearer stiU. Ogle and Brett stood together, both well mounted, and both resolute men ; but the advantage was with Ogle, because he knew what was about to take place, and was fully on his guard ; whereas the officer from Newgate would be taken by sur prise whenever Ogle bpgan to act He might not have presence of mind enough to take any steps to thwart him untU to- late. That was Ogle's great chance. The carts came closer still. She despaired ! Perhaps it was the first momeLt that she actually did despair. It seems so impossible to the young to die. It seems so impious to donbt the majesty, the justice, and the goodness of heaven sufficiently to believe that beneath its azure vault any very great iniquity can be committed. An iniquity involving the death of one of its creatures \u2014 if so, why the creation ? Bnt that one look at the gaUows at Tyburn had destroyed aU hope. Ah! storm-tossed mariner, with the weltering waters around you as far as eye can reach, des pair not, for with flowing sail, the vessel that shall bear you to a haven of safety, may already be above the horizon ! Ogle could hear the clergjman speaking to the young girl. \" It will be a great consolation to the judge and jury if you will confess your guUt\" \" But I am innocent !\" \" Oh, don't say that\u2014 don't, now ! You have had a regular trial, aiid been convicted ; so don't let me hear you say that agaio, if you wish for peace here, for the Fhort time you have to live, and pardon hereafter.\" \" It is you who should seek for pardon,\" moaned the young girl, \"and you will have to do so for uncharitably judging a fellow-creature.\" \" Ah, I am afraid you are hardened \u2014 very hardened, indeed !\" The Reverend Mortification Ripon hearing this thought he ought iu order to keep up his cha racter, to exhort Jonathan Wild a little. \" Yea !\" he said, \" listen to me 1 When yo\u00ab have your mouth and ears fuU of red-hot brim stone, and are carried round a certain place by a hot pitchfork in the small of yonr baGk, you will not feel very comfortable, you infernal ras cal!\" Most miserable wretch, with famine staring you in the face, despair not ; for some combination of events may be, even at the moment of your aban donment of aU hope, working to an end to save you! That young girl was not to suffer. She saw the other cart, and she saw the men on horseback that attended it ; bnt she did not see in them her rescuers. They were such, however. Ogle registered a vow in his heart that he would anatch that girl from death. And he did it. But we must not anticipate. Tom Ripon rode back from the Sheriff, as we have recorded, and waved his hand. \" It's quite right!\" \" Then,\" said Brett \" I have nothing more to say about it; but tbe Newgate hangman may as well do the job for both.\" \" Nay,*\" said Ogle ; \" our friend here in the red nightcap has a particular reason for doing his own The reverend Ordinary of Newgate pricked up his ears. The two carts were close together, and he shook his head at Mortification, as he said, \" Reverend brother, that is not the way to exhort a sinner !\" \" Go to the deuce!\" said Mortification. Now the reverend gentleman who made use ot job.\""], [268, "262 EDITH HERON. this irreverent expression would not have done so but for an especial reason. That reason may be summed up cursorily in two words \u2014 \"' Jamaica ram !\" That was the Reverend Mortification's little failing. He was seldom \u2014 and this was not one of tha occasions \u2014 without a case- bottle of his favourite liquor. He had imbibed therefore quite sufficient by the time he had reached Tyburn to feel very independent \" Why,\" said ihe Ordinary, \" the man is drank!\" \"Drunk yourself!\" cried Mortification. \"Yea, as the Psalmist says, \u2014 Then there were generally some kind, officious people who were ready to lend a hand in pulling the legs of the sufferer. The hangman from Newgate leaped into the cart where Jonathan Wild was, as he said to the spy, \" Come, brother, yon and I will manage the Uttle job between us !\" \" Very good,\" said the spy. \" Why \u2014 what ? You \u2014 you are Jerry Margate, yon are I\" \" No,\" said Ogle, as he held a pistol quite care lessly, to all appearance, but, in reality, in a right line to tbe head of the spy, \u2014 \" no ; his name is Daniel Brown 1\" \" Yes : my name is Daniel Brown I\" \" Is it ?\" \" ' Wine fires us, and inspires us. Let's drink to jolly Bacchuc '. Hip ! hip ! hurrah ! Nine cheers for the girls that we love ! \u2014 Lov-ov-ov-ov-ov love I' \" \"Oh. yes!\" \" Then you are au out-and-out picture of Jerry Margets, who is one of Jonathan Wild's bnH-dogs ; but it don't matter to me a bit 1\" \" Good gracious !\" cried the reverend Ordinary ; \" was there ever anything so profane ?\" \"Yei!\" added Mortification. \"You are, you old sinner ! The spy licked his lips, and looked askance at Ogle. Jonathan WUd kicked, and pluriged, and made the most extraordinary sounds still. Tom Ripon bad given the cotton nightcap an extra pull, and it was over the end of Jonathan's nose now, so that ha was not recognisable, and had no power to move. The vexation, the rage, the agony that Wild must have endured at that time, were surely such as to transcend all description. Truly he had met with a mortal retribution for his numerous crimes, and offences, and cruelties. No death, however violent and painful, could have inflicted upon him one-tenth part of thu mental suffering he wan now enduring. To be hanged up like a dog in the presence of hundreds of people who knew him, and he not able to say one word to let them know who ho was! \" ' Oh, where did you get that jolly nose ? Out of the tankard. I do suppose ! Ya, hip 1 \u2014 ya, hip ! hurrah t * Go to blazes!\" The- Reverend Mortification was about to take another pull at the case-bottle, when Ogle dashed it from his hand, and eaid to him in suppressed tones, \"Do you want to destroy us all? Oh, shame \u2014 shame ! Now, Tom 1\" The \" Now, Tom !\" alluded to some private in structions Ogle had given Tom a few seconds before on seeing the defiant state of the Rev. Mortification. It was customary at executions to have several paUs of water at the foot of the gallows, from which the criminal might have a last draught, and whiGh were used to pour down by the posts of the fatal tree, to fix them firmly in the sod. One of these Tom flung completely over the Rev. Mortification. Oh, it was horrible ! Some went on Wild. Some on the spy. But the bulk went into the face of Mortification, and a good quantity down his throat He gasped like some huge fi9h that has been successfully hooked and brought to shore. But he was partiaUy sobered. \" Yea, it raineth a little !\" he said, and he spoke in quite a subdued manner to what he had done. The Ordinary was quite delighted at the pro ceeding of Tom, and offered him a shilling \" Thank you,\" said Tom ; \" I'll do as much for you, sir, any time !\" Jonathan Wild made the most awful and un earthly noises now as the cart was brought up under the cross-beam of the gallows. The spy produced a rope with a noose, aud put the latter round Wild's neck. CHAPTER XCIX. GOLF. LEAVES JONATHAN WILD AT THE END OP A ROPE, AND SAVES AN INNOCENT LIFE Jonathan was placed under the fatal beam, and the noose was around his neck. He was forced to stand up. Had he done otherwise, he would only havo hanged himself all the quicker. \" Now, my dear !\" said the Newgate hangman to the young girl, \"you wUl take your place by this nice-looking man !\" Another shriek burst from the pale lips of the young girl. She fought\u2014 she struggled for life. The sight tore the heart-strings of Ogle ; but he took the opportunity of all eyes being upon her of whispering to Tom Ripon. \" Get all our men together ! Let the spare horses be close to the cart! Tell Mortification to mount and be ready for a start, if be is not too drunk I\" The awful noises Jonathan made increased. \" He don't Beem resigned !\" said the Ordinary of Newgate. \"Yea, he is a limb of Satan!\" said Mortifica tion. \" Is yours resigned ?\" \"Don't speak to me, you disgrace to your cloth !\" said the Ordinary. Hanging was done in those days in the old primitive fashion of pi icing tha convict under the cross-tree of tha gallows in the cart, and after the rope was comfortably adjusted, driving the said cart away from under him, or her, as the case might be. \" All right, Ogle ! You mean to\u2014 to \" \" To save the girl, and fight onr way out of tho crowd ! Woe be to the man who holds forth a hand to stay me !\" A flush came over the face of Tom Ripon. It was a flush of pleasurable excitement \" All right Ogle\u2014 all right ! Thank God for that! We will do it!\""], [269, "EDITT1 HERON, 263 t \" We will !\" after the first surprise, they had dashed in among the crowd to follow Ogle. That was fatal to their progress. Twenty hands were npon every man. Pale and terrified \u2014 for knives and sticks were brandished in their faces\u2014 the officers gave up all ideas of pursuit Nay, the majority of them were only anxious to assure the crowd of infuriated people about them that they were glad the girl had escaped the death designed for her. The Ordinary of Newgate clnng to the cart, and shook in every limb from fright The hangman crouched down to avoid sho\" rers of stones and a few bricks. Ogle felt that now all must depend upon Tom Ripon giving the precise instructions to \"the band what to do, and upon their doing it properly. The moment was critical. The mob groaned and yelled. What was it at ? Ah, yes ! It was in sympathy with the young girl. To the ears of Ogle there was musio in the sounds. They would aid him whan it came to the push. A few stones were thrown. \" Shame ! shame ! Let the girl go ! A re prieve for the girl ! Yah ! Hoot ! hoot ! Shame ! shame ! Pelt them ! Save the girl !\" The mob heaved and stirred like the sea in commotion. \" Halt!\" cried Ogle. The band came to a stand-still. He had the young girl on the saddle before him. Ogle was quite delighted. Every stone that hit him was an actual plea surable sensation to him. \" Now for it ! Hold her up !\" cried the New gate hangman. Ogle had pressed his horse close to the cart, and he said \" I wiU,\" as he flung his left arm round the slender form of the young girl. \"Thank you!\" A yell and a goan burst from the crowd at this act of Ogles, which was so entirely mis taken. \" Are we all here ?\" \" All!\" cried Tom. \" Mortification ? Is that fool with us ?\" \" Yea, he is,\" said Mortification. Ogle raised his hat, aud looked smUingly back to the crowd. He raised it above his head, and they understood the action, and gave him three such cheers that the whole neighbourhood rang with them. Timid tradesmen in the Oxford Road began to put up the shutters of their shops, for fear a riot The Sheriff drew off through Hyde Part \" Now, my dear,\" said Ogle, to the young girl, \" oan you ride ?\" \" Oh, heaven ! is it a dream ?\" \" Not at all. You are safe \u2014 safe as though you were in the arms of your mother. Ah, that's right ! Cry away \u2014 it wUl do you a world of good !\" She did cry \u2014 ob, such tears ! \u2014 but each one washed away some of the terror and some of the bitterness of her heart, so they were blessed tears. \" Now, tell me again,\" said Ogle, after the lapse of a moment, \"can you ride?\" \" Yes, yes !\" \" That's a mercy I Now, Tom, the spare horsa, and off we go to Epping Forest. We have done a good morning's work, I fancy, and one that we shall look back upon with delight !\" The rescued girl was helped to one of the horses ; and Ogle, seeing that she was rapidly re- covering her strength and spirits, gave the order to start again. They took the same route by which they had come, and were soon in the open country. Tom Ripon rode up to the sida of Ogle. \" I say, don't you go for to think you have done the buiiness for Jonathau WUd, Ogle.\" \"You think not?\" Jonathan Wild managed, at that awful moment for him, to utter such an inhuman cry, that it frightened the horse in the cart. 'i'be creature made a plunge forward. Ogle had his right hand in his deep skirt pocket. There he had managed with that one hand to open a knife. \" Hurrah !\" he shouted, in a voice that rose above all other sounds ; and at the moment the cart moved awsy beneath the feet of the victim. He supported the girl on his left arm, and with his right hand armed with the knife, he cut the rope. She fell half across his saddle. \" Make way, human hearts and human souls, and I wUl save her!\" shouted Ogle. A roar of gratification came from the mob. The officers from Newgate were, as Ogle had meant they should be, bewildered for a few seconds, and knew not what to do for the best Those few seconds saved Ogle and his little party. The mob opened a passage for him and the band \u2014 like the ocean, when it parted for the march of the chUdren of Israel. The cheers were deafening. The great heart of the people was touched. Women struggled forward to kiss the horses and the garments of Ogle and his men. Money was UteraUy thrust into their pockets. In three minutes' time there were three thousand people between them and the officers. Tom shook his head. \" I saw that rascal who was to have hung him, and who ought to have been hung himself on one of tha old trees of Epping Forest, moving about his arms like a windmill, and saying something, and then down dropped Jonathan Wild.\" \" I saw him dr p, Tom, but I think it must have been with a broken neck.\" \" Well, I hope so. If he is not dead, he won't feel very amiable towards us.\" Ogle laughed. \" No, Tom, but I don't think we need care any thing more abont that than usual, since I don't know the time when he did feel very amiable towards us.\" The gallant act was done. The young girl was saved. And there hung Jonathan Wild, looking hide ously long and distinct, against the fair sky. Down, then, fell the body ! Whether the rope had broken, or he had been cut down, Ogle could not say ; but he saw him go down among the crowd, like a man dropping into a well. There was not the least occasion, now, for Ogle and his band to hurry. The half-dozen officers from Newgate were completely helpless ; for at the first moment of returning consciousness of what had happened, \" Well, I hope be is settled !\" \" And so do I.\" \" Do you know, Ogle, what he promised me r\""], [270, "EDITH I1F.R0W. 264 \"No. What?\" CHAPTER C. \" Uh, I dou't mind! but he said if he was tanged, his ghost should haunt me every night of my life \" \" Ha ! ha ! I think you can afford, Tom, to laugh at Jonaihan Wild's ghos', can't you ?\" \" I'll try. He was a bad-looking pece of goods when he was alive ! I don't know what his ghost may be like.\" LORD WARKINODALE FANCIES BE HAS SEEN THE LAST OF JONATHAN V. ILD, AND REJOICES AC- CORDINGLY. Oglb had seen an action on tbe part of Jonathan Wild's old associate, who had beeu compelled to play the part of executioner at Tyburn, which had awakened a suspicion in his miDd tbat all the pains that hid been taken to hang Jonathan WUd were thrown away. Ogle was right in that ooojecture. The position of the detected spy of Epping Forest was rather a serious one, considering all things. \" Perhaps an improvement, Tom.\" \" I hop. so. But I say, Ogle !\" \"Whatuuw?\" fc Oh, dear ! Heigho ! Oh, oh !\" * Why, what on earth is the matter now, Tom? A pain in your inside?\" \" Don't be common and vulgar. Ogle, don't. Ain't tbat yonng girl a beauty ! Did you see her eyes, Ogle, and her hair, aud her chin, and her mouth, aud -ter cheeks \" \" And her no_\u00bb,\" said Ogle. \" Come, now, ain't she a beauty ?\" \" She is a nice-lockiug ycuu^ creature, and I know something about; her.\" \"You do! Oh, what?\" \"Hush! It's a secret!\" If Jonathan WUd were in reality executed, it would, probably, as far as he (the spy) was con cerned, be construed into manslaughter. The manifest policy of that man was to stand well with the authorities about him. Immediately, then, upon the departure of Ogle and his little party, the spy found his tongue. \"Help! help! This is Mr. WUd\u2014 Mr. Jona than Wild ! He ought not to be hung ! Hoy I A knife ! Help ! Cut him down !\" This speech was perfectly conect in all par ticulars save one, and lhat one consisted in the statement that Jonathan WUd ought not to be hung. \"Is it?\" \" Yes.

All the crowa wno neara that were decidedly of a different opinion. But there was sufficient common cause between Jonathan Wild and the constables, who were still present at Tyburn, to make them prick up their ears at the statement from the man who had hitherto played the part of the county hangman. \" What do you mean ?\" cried half-a-dozen voices in chorus. \" Hoot ! hoot I To-whoo ! to-whoo I\" A 6cout dropped from a tree. \"Hurrah, Ogle! Have you hung old Jona than ?\" \" Cat him down ! Cat Mr. Jonathan Wild dowu !\" \" Yes, to be sure. But we are half afraid some body cut him down too soon ; however, we hope not for it ever a mau was born to be bung, it certainly must b\u00bb Jonathan WUd. Where is the Captain ?\" \"Here!\" For a few seconds no one had presence of mind enough to do the act, and then one of the mounted constables who had come with the young girl to that horrible place of death, drew his cutlass, and, with one slash, fevered the rope. Down dropped Wild. As no one took the kindly precaution to break his fall, Jonathan fell to tbe ground with a force sufficient to break every bouo in his body. Probably, such would have been the result under any other circumstances ; but, as it was, the per fectly inert way in which Wild fell saved hitu. It is a known fact that the most serious falls would seldom result in any fatal injuries if it were possible for the person falling at the moment to make uo muscular effort to save himself. Felix Heron appeared on the spot \" Ah, Ogle I I did not recollect, till you and the men had left, what sort of expedition jou were on, and 1 have only now to be thankful to See you all baok again ia safety.\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification Ripon,--\"yea, as the Psalmist sayeth, here we are, like unto a bad penny, which raturneth to the nan who attemptetb to pass it We have brought with vi c riaiden, who is fair to look upon, and who \u2014 hem! \u2014 who will be my special care !\" \" Oh I wiU she ?\" said Tom. In this case of Wild's no such effort was made, and he came down vcitli a bumpiDg blow to the earth that was sickening to hear. \" Dead !\" cried the man wl.c had cut him down. \" Yea, my thoughts cleave unto the damsel. yea, I \" \" Hold your row, de !

And snch indeed seemed to be tba fact The lcok of the affair -/as that society had certainly got rid of Jonathan Wild. He lay motionless for seconds; and tnen the man who h- 1 been compelled i.0 play tbe part of his executioner, lifted him by tho arms and called ont to somebody tc take lue nightcap iff his face. Up to tha-t moment there was still a reasonable doubt in regard to tha identity of the great thief taker.

I That he was quite dead no one now enter tained a donbt. The honse was a large aud a dingy one. It had once been a fashionable nnoogh abode, but, by some means, had fallen into neglect and decay. To all appearance, from the outside, this house, which might almost be called a mansion, was uninhabited. As the cavalcade got about half-way down Oxford Road, a copious sho wer of rain fell. The supposed dead body of Wild was exposed to all the fury of tbe descending shower, for no one thought it worth while to attempt to screen it. The effect of this rain, though, however uncom fortable in other respects it might be to the officers, was to effectually rid them of the couple of hnndred kooting, shouting vagabonds who still had accompanied them from the old Tyburn Tree. By the time they turned into Holborn, they were alone with their ghostly occupant of the cart. But that was only an appearance, and as false as most of the appearances in this world In reply to the taps, to the exact number of nine, which Warringdile gave upon the panel of tha door with the handle of his riding-whip, tho door was at once opened. Without a word he passed in. The boy who held his horse walked it slowly round Leicester Square, aocording to orders. Lord Warringdale went along th _ passage of the dirty and neglected mansion, with all the air and manner of one well acquainted with the place, and sure of a welcome. Then a man on horseback, with one of the hooded cloaks that were then the fashion drawn closely over his face, and almost so far as to hide even his eyes, rode up to the cart \" What is this ? What do I hear ? Is it true ?\" \" What true, master ?\" \" Is Jonathan Wild dead ?\" \" Le Jeune I\" he cried, \u2014 \" Le Jeune, I say, where are you ? Up ! up ! I have some news for you ! \" A trembling, rumbling sound came from a room on the ground floor, and then a door was opened. The person who appeared at it was Le Jeune. He was in a state of deshabille as regarded hia apparel, but he called out eagerly to Warringdale, \" Is that yon, my lord ?\" \" Yes, yes ! I bring good news.\" \" Ah, what is it ?\" \"Jonathan Wild is dead!\" \" Oh, yes, he is dead enough.\" \" Can I believe my ears ?\" \" Ton can, sir. if you think yon cannot, you will no doubt be able to believe your eyes, sir, if you happened to know him.\" \" I did ! I did !\" There was an air and manner about this stranger on the horse, which sufficiently proclaimed that he belonged to the upper classes of society, and hence th\u00bb sort of deference with which the officers treated him. \" Too good to be true, my lord ! A great deal too good to be true 1\" * So should I have said if any one had simply told me of it ; but I have seen the body.\" \" You have?\" The social distinctions of that age were much more strongly marked than they are now, when the spread of education, aud the cultivation of manners, makes it difficult to know a peer from a pawnbroker. \" Let me see him ! \u2014 let me look at him for one moment!\" cried the gentleman with the cloak. \" Thera he is, sir !\" The hat that had been pulled over Wild's face was lifted off. \" I have, Le Jeune.\" \" When, my lord ?\" \" Within tha last half-hour.\" \" It is a sight,\" cried Le Jeune, as he hurried on his coat, * that I would go a good distance to see myself ; and, as you have seen it, I suppos3 there is no reason why I should not.\" \" I think there is. Listen, and I wilt tell you how I chauced on such a v.-tlcome sight\" Lord Warringdale followed Le Jeans into a room that had beeu converted into a bed-chamber, bat the moment he entered it he started back as if in affright. \" It is Wild I\" \" Oh, yes, sir I\" \"And dead at last!\" \" At last, sir !\" \" I am satisfied. There is a guinea to drink my health ! Never mind who I am. The drink will be none the worse.\" \" You are not alone in this house, Le Jeune.\" A hat was on a table, and it was evidently not that of Le Jeune, for another was on a chair by the bed-side. \" Not a bit, sir.\" \" Not a bit my lord,\" cried another of the men. \" Ah !\" said the stranger; and, as if in a sudden fright he drew the hood of hit cloak still further over his face, and galloped away. No one recognised in that stranger Lord War ringdale, who was still a kind of fugitive, who dared not show himself openly in public. But the supposed death of Jonathan Wild lifted a load of care from the mind of Warringdale. So deeply was he implicated in the villanies of Wild, that he would freely have bartered some years of his own life to be confident the thief taker was no more. \" Well, my lord, I am not alone, but you kno w the man who is with me.\" \" Who ? Who ?\" \" Captain Target.\" \" Ah ! he of whom yon spoke. That man who, without a doubt, has it in nis power, more than any living being, to interfere with the security of Edith, the Countess of Whitcombe. Can it be that you have encountered him ?\" \" I have, my lord. We met last night at the gaming-table, and all I can say i\u00bb, that a man more devoted to your lordship's interest is not be found, except myself.\" \" Where is he ?\" And now the end was fairly achieved, and with out any danger to him. No wonder that Lord Warringdale felt gratifi cation. \" Up-stairs. He preferred one of the old beds in the upper part of the house. Don't think, though, he will be down very quickly.\" \" Why not ?\" \" Well, the fact is that laat night Captain Target was unlucky ; and when that is the case, he usually indulges in the refreshments that they allow, with no niggard haud, at the gaming- home \" He spurred his horse, and at a speed that made his progress dangerous to tbe passengers in the quiet streets down whioh he now took his way, he rode to the WesS End of London, and halted not until he reached a quiet street in the immediate neighbourhood of Leicester Square, where he alighted, giving his horse to a boy to hold."], [273, "EDITH HERON. 267 \" I understand you\u2014 I quite understand; and that is the reason why that man will never be of any service to me.\" \" Oh, you may trust him, my lord !\" \" Yes, when he is trustworthy ; hut the wine is in and the wit is out, and that is the general condition of that man.\" \" Never fear, my lord. I will see to him ; and there is one good always to be got out of him.\" \" What is that ?\" By the aid of a skeleton key, a cupboard in which it was known that Wild kept certain stores of a spirituous character was opened, and without the fear of their imperious master before their eyes, the bull-dogs and janisnaries set in for a regale. The day dropped. Wild was all alone. His men held high revel in one of the rooma on tbe same floor on which he lay in the coffin. That coffin had been provided for the fair young girl who had been so gallantly rescued by Ogle from a terrible death. Little did the authorities of Newgate ever sup pose that it would come back with Jonathan Wild in it. \" He is the best man in the world for our en terprise against Captain Heron; because, if he should be caught, he can always save himself by stating his relationship to Edith, the Countess.\" Lord Warringdale paced the room twice to and fro before he nade any reply to the remark. Was he, at that time, thinking of how often he had been spared by his noble and generous half brother, on that very ground of relationship ? Perhaps he was. Bnt those were not tbe kind of considerations that ever had any effect upon the mind of War ringdale. Turning hastily to Le Jenne, he spoke. \" Well, be it so. He may be uselul ; keep close, and I will return to you both in the evening. Till then, farewell!\" But there he was. The riot of carts and coaches came past his house, but he was deaf to them all. The tipsy revelry of the men who had been taught to creep about tbat house, like mice avoid ing a cat, rang throngh the dwelling, but he heard it not The twilight came. Then the twilight faded away. Darkness was over the city. Then there came a sharp ring at the bell of Jonathan's house, and two hard raps at the knocker. \" Yes, my lord ; but it is quite a strange thing, mv lord.\" '\u2022' What is ?\" It was habit, rather than any care or disposi tion that now remained of their duties, that caused one of the janissaries to go to the door. A man in black, with a small boy carrying a, basket was on the door-step \" What's the row, now ?\" said the janissary, as he stood with the half-open door in his hand. \" Doctor Burnett,\" said the boy. \" The Crowner's 'quest on Mr. Wild is to be to-morrow, and the Crowner wants Doctor Burnett to see as to the reason.\" \" Why, that luck, during the last hour of the play last night, should have turned against me. I have not a shilling in the world.\" \" You never have. Take that purse, and be prudent\" Lord Warringdale left the honse, and Le Jeune, as h9 weighed the purse in his hand, called out aloud, \" Target, Target I \u2014 Captain, I say ! Here's money ! Get up ! \u2014 get up ! We can go and have another try with < itner cards or the ivory, just which you like ! Get up, I say ! And, besides, I have some capital news for you- It is news that has opened the heart and hand of my Lord of Warringdale. Jonathan Wild is dead. Ha, ha ! What do yon think of that ?\" \" The what ?\" \"The reason!\" \" My good man,\" said the personage in black, \" I am, as my boy informs you, Doctor Burnett and my errand here is to examine the body of Jonathan Wild, by order of the City Coroner, so that at the inquest, which will take place here at eleven o'clock, I may be able to depose to the cause of death.\" CHAPTER Cl. \"Oh, that's it!\" \" Yes, my friend ; bnt, if yon make any objec tion, all I shall have to do is to make a com plaint to the Coroner.\" \" Oh, I haven't any objection I\" \" Very good.\" \" Come in.\" JONATHAN WILD FINDS HIS WAY TO LIFE AGAIN, AND TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP IN HI] CAREER. Thf cavalcade of officers who conducted Jonathan Wild into the City stopped at Newgate Street. Some of the bull-dogs and janissaries that, since his last adventures, which had rather scattered those personages, he had succeeded in bringing to gether again, ran out to see what had happened. \" Take him in !\" cried one of the officers. \" He's gone at last 1\" \" Follow me, Timotheug.\" \" Yes, sir.\" The small boy followed the Doctor into Jona than Wild's house. \"There!\" said the janissary who had opened the door, as he thrust into Timotheus's haud the light he had brought with him \u2014 *' there, you can light the Doctor up-stairs. It's the first room tho door of which you can run your nose against That's the key.\" Timotheus, as the Doctor named him, took the key and the light, and preceded his master up stairs. Timotheus went very slowly. \" I shall be under the necessity,\" said Doctor Burnett, \"of producing a peculiar sensation on your ears, by divers conoussions, if you don't go faster, Timotheus.\" \" I am going fast sir.\" \" Dead ?\" \" Ay, as a nail !\" Jonathan Wild, for the convenience of carrying, was placed in the coffin that was in the cirt, and so carried into his own house, and put in a room on the first floor. The janissaries looked at each other in amaze ment. What exactly to do they knew not; but as the officers with the cart considered their duty at an end, and moved off, the janissaries were quite de lighted to get hold of the spy, who promised them a fall and particular account of all that had taken \" Faster still, then!\" place."], [274, "EDITH HERON. 268 The pain, no doubt, \"tw iuteuse. With a yell, Wild started up to a sitting pos- \u2022' But it's too bad, sir !\" \" Ab ! what is too bad ?\" \" Why, to give a fellow three shillings a week, and upect a fellow to be pulling about dead peop'e allers for that!\" \"Oh, indeed?\" \u25a0 Yes, sir.\" \"There\u2014 take that!\" ture. \"Capital! capital!\" cried Ihe Dootor. Wild opened his eyes, and glared about him \" Better still\u2014 excellent I\" The Doctor insetted another sharp point just be hind Wild's ear. He uttered another cry, and then he, with one abort, sharp, decisive blow, judiciously a.lmiuis tered between the eyes, sent the Doctor sprawling backwards amid the wreck of his apparatus. Wild had not yet uttered an articulate word, but he was not long in doing so. \" Brandy !\" That was the word that came uppermost to the perceptions of the resuscitated thief-taker. Then he sprang ont of the cuffin. But he was weak, and could not stand. He reeled back, and had to hold by the back of a chair for support. \" Oh ! oh ! oh !\" \" I expect Timotheus, that by that box on the ears, vulgarly so called, I have produced the sin gular visual phenomenon by which you suddenly saw a number of lights instead of one ?\" \" I won't stand it\u2014 I won't I\" \"You won't ?\" \" No ; I'll run away to sea\u2014 I'll go for a sojer \u2014I'll\u2014 I'll do anything ; but I won't stand it no longer \u2014 I won't!\" The Doctor turned up his cuffs. \" Timotheus, I am again under the necessity of \" He glared about him with awful bloodshot eyes. \" What has happened ? Where am I ? What \u2014 wnat is it all ? Brandy !\" Jonathan Wild could not help thinking that a copious draught of his favourite liquor woula have the effect cf clearing his mind, aud enabling him to comprehend his position. A few more glances about him enabled him to see that he was in his own room. It was not likely that any \" own room \" of Jonatban Wild's would be without a supply of his fancy stimulant He staggered across the floor to reach a sideboard. He had not the key, but ono tick sufficed to open the door. Timotheus. however, this time did not wait for the coming infliction, but, throwing down the candle and the key, he ran down st-irs. and finding the latch and the bolts of Jonathan Wild's door, more by good luck than by any real knowledge of their position, he opened it, and was off into Newgate Street, and lost to sight, before the Doctor could capture him. The light rolled into the passage, but it was cot extinguished. The Doctor picked it up, and likewise the key. \" The young rascal 1\" he muttered ; \" I fear he has really gone this time, and taken with him the basket with my newly invented electro-galvanic apparatus. No, no! Here it is! Tbe little scamp ! He ought to have been glad of two shil lings a week and the leaviDgs cf my table\u2014 not that I ever did leave anything but potato peels, and the bone of a small mutton chop; but still, as I say, he ought to be thankful, and he is not, which shows that there is no such thing as grati tude in the world!\" Wild seized a bottle, and placed it to his lips- How much raw spirit he drank on that occasion it is hard to say, but he left none in the bottle, which, when he let it fall to the floor, did uoi be\u00bbk, but rolled over on to its side, empty. \"Ah! I am better!\" Jonathan held his head by both his hands. There was a terrible throbbing there. Perhaps the half-congealed blood about his brain was liquefying, and slowly piercing its wonted chan nels. With this sage remark, the Doctor picked up the key aud the caudle, and ascended to Jonathan Wild's room. He likewise carried the basket with him, which, he had announced, contained the newly- invented electro- galvanic apparatus. If that were so, the prooess was a painful one. But the throbbing gradually subsided, and Wild found his strength was returning back to bim. Then the Doctor sat up. \" Ah ! you are not dead, then ?\" cried Jonathan, as he snatched np the bottle by its neck. \" Not 1 1\" The sciences, or one science, which gave a name to the Doctor's apparatus, then made a great nolse^in the world, and Doctor Burnett never omitted an opportunity of testing the effects of the apparatus which he had himself projected, for the purpose of exhibiting the phenomena. An enthusiast in science is never appalled by anything, and when Doctor Burnett looked into the livid face of Jonathan Wild, he only saw a subject for his experiments. \" Ah, hanged ! Well, it ought to ee a gratifi cation even to this man that he is useful, iu a scientific puint of view, after his death. Hold up a little !\" Doctor Burnett bad not time to add more. The bottle and his head had a collision, in which both were cracked. The Doctor fell backwards, and Wild glared at him like a demon. \" 1 don't know who and what you are,\" he growled, \" nor what hand you have bad in all tbat has taken place, but I do know you have no business here !\" . Wild then sat down, anp tried to think. The Doctor was in the habit of addressing dead people just as if they kuew what he said. \" 1 have often,\" he added, \" thought that when any one is going to Tyburn to be hanged, aud i.bowa impatience and distaste to the ceremony, t_ey ought to be informed that it is highly pro bable tbe diosection of their remains after death It was quite a difficulty to him to call upon his memory for au explanation of the past. All that he seemed able to recollect was tbat he had had a fall from some tremendous and inconceivable height That, no doubt, was when he was cut down from Tyburn Tree. will perhaps elucidate some knotty point in com parative anatomy. A little this way !\" The Dcctor inserted the sharp end of a piece of wire just at the top of the back-bone of Jonathan WiU Bui he was recovering, and he soon adopted the best plan to clear his faculties, wh ch was to throw his mind back, so to speak, to a distance. \" Epping Forest,\" he said. ' i was there. Yet,"], [275, "EDITH HERON. 269 I was the prisoner of Captain Heron, at the Forest W hat happened then ? Let me think right on in a regular way, and find out what happened after that?\" possession of the title and estates of Wbitcomhe wonld be to prove that they were the lineal repre sentative of the younger hranch of the family. There were two names in the document signed by Hugh de Mowbray, tho father of the late E*rl of Whitcombe. Jonathan Wild still felt confused, but he was on the high road to clearing his intellects and thoroughly comprehending his position and the circumstances that had led to it One of those names was Weldt The other was Dumare. Tbe name of Weldt was the one wh'ch it was stated the younger son of the Wbitcoinbes bad taken in consequence of a matrimonial alliance with a Dutch family of that name. The name Dumare was stated to be that of a family in France, who were in possession of the particulars that would make the claim of the younger branch of the Whitcombes to the title and estates of the family clear and apparent. Jonathan Wild sat down on tbe topmost stair of that flight which led from the passage of his house to the room he had for once occupied in a cjffia, and reflected. Bit by bit he recollected all. The condemnation at the Forest\u2014 the route to London \u2014 the arrival at Tyburn \u2014 the agonized efforts he had made to speak, but all in vain and then the hanging. After that point Wild felt that there was a hiatus. He had been blotted ont of existence for a certain period, during which his mind was a blank. The last fair recollection before that blank con sisted of his finding himself, in imagination, sur rounded by th\u00a9 most brilliant fireworks the mind or the fancy cosld possibly conceive. Then had come the blank. But Wild now understood what that blank meant so deep were those reflections, that they were hardly disturbed by the sbouts of merriment that came echoing up from the kitchen below, where the janissaries and the bull-dogs were enj tying themselves. He was dead then ! Dead to the world and all its sensations \u2014 all its hopes, and all its fears, and all its ambitions ; but the erring spirit had been, by some means, re called to its tenement of clay, and he breathed again ! Again he was Jonathan Wild. A gain a terror, a blight, and a desolation to all with whom he came into contact If they could bnt have known that Jonathan heard them ! He did hear them ; but he was intent npon other things. \" Ah I\" he said. \" Yes, such an opportunity as this will not occur again in my life. While I am supposed to be dead, what is to hinder me from taking this important journey to the forest of Vin cennes, in France, ana to Holland, in search of the proofs and the particulars of what is stated in the document found in the tomb?\" Rapidly the hardy physical frame of the ruffian thief-taker recovered even from that terrible shock which it had received. 1 n half an hour more Jonathan Wild was him self again- All he felt was an uncomfortable stiffness abont the neck. The more Wild thought over this idea, the more it recommended itself to him. He fancied, too, that his head had an inclination to be a little on one side, somehow. He felt in his pocket \u2014 for the feasibility of the transaction depended upon the pecuniary means he had of carrying it out Not a groat ! Wild uttered some unpleasant remarks abont the band of Captain Heron, the members of wbich had taken good care that he (Wild) should not leave Epping Forest burdened with cash. \" Well,\" he said, * it don't matter ! I shall want French money, and \u2014 ha, ha ! \u2014 I may as well take it when I do want it\" But that was not mncb, and Wild was not a very particular man about personal appearance, so it did very well. CHAPTER OIL JONATHAN WILD DISAPPEARS FROM HIS HOUSE LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER. He rose from his temporary hiding-place on the top of the stairs, and went into the room again. From a corner, half-hidden by the sideboard, he had kicked open, he took one of those short but fearfully effective bludgeons he was so fond of carrying with him. Poising it in his hand a moment, he muttered \" That wiU do!\" and then he slowly crept down the staircase of his house. The sounds of tipsy revelry in the lower part of his honse came very strangely to Wild's ears when he opened the door of the room in which it was believed he was lying in death. A grim smile came over his face as he listened. \" Very good !\" he said. \" I will find a means surely of making you all laugh on the other side of your months.\" He took two steps down the staircase, and then he paused. New thoughts \u2014 those second thoughts which the world's sages have so often declared to be the best \u2014 came over him. He began to think that surely he was casting away a capital opportunity of carrying out his plai. s. His plans with regard to the peerage of Whit combe. Wild had never forgotten the contents of that important and singular document that had been found in the vault at Westminster Abbey. If the statements contained in that paper were true, all any one wonld have to do who wanted But it went sadly against the grain for Jonathan to leave his men in snch good spirits, and carousing at the rate they were. He almost howled with rage as he listened to them. One was singing a comic song, amid the up roarious laughter of the others Then Wild gave a start ; for he had thought of something to do, that, if it did not kill or maim, would be sure to terrify. He crept slowly up-stairs again, and made his way right to the top of tbe house, to one of the disused attics there, which he allowed no one ever to visit except in his company. Iu the little skeleton grate of one of those atties, Wild kept a small keg of gunpowder."], [276, "EDITH HERON. 270 took his way towards the City,\u2014\" that will do I I should not have liked to go so long a journey without leaving some little remembranoe behind me!\" He took his way towards old London Bridge. \" Hoy ! hoy I A boat I\u2014 a boat 1\" \" Yes, yonr honour.\" \"How is the tide?\" \" Running down, yonr honour, hard and fast. \" Good 1 Can you get as far as Greenwich in your craft?\" \"Oh, ye\u00bb, easy, air\u2014 step in I Come in, bal A gent to Green wioh Stairs I\" Wild atepped into the wherry ; and as it was pulled down the stairs by tbe waterman and his boy, he reflected upon the best mode of getting to France. A journey to the Continent was then a very different matter to what it is now. Wild had scarcely knowledge enough on the subject to oome to a very easy and prompt de cision. Orieinally it had contained nine pounds, but there was not above one-half that quantity left StiU. four or five pounds would make a very tolerable explosion . Jonathan carried the little keg down stairs care \u00b0He took out, when he reached the passage, a conical-shaped small cork, whioh fitted like the vent-peg of a beer-barrel into the side of the gun along the passage, and right ont to the door-step, he sprinkled a horn of powder. The keg itself he placed close down to the door of the kitchen, wishin which the janissaries were so greatly enjoying themselves. \"Hip, hip, hip!\u2014 hoorah 1\" shouted everybody in chorus after the comic song was over. Wild amiled grimly. \" I tells yer what it is, pals all,\" cried one ; \" the old einner, Jonathan, must have made no end of money ; and where should it be, but some wheres or another in this here crib ?\" \"That's the right thing I\" shouted another. \" I'd put up with a sight of old Wild's ghost, if he could only show us where he hid the swag, that I would!\" , ,.__ \" Well,\" said a third, \" tbe ghost couldn t bo a bit nglier than Jonathan himself!

But for my part it seems to me that there's a jolly good time for all things ; and to night's the time to have a jolly good rout ont of this crib !\" \" Yon think so, Dobb3 ?\" \" I do ! To-morrow the beaks, the crowners, the nab-alls, and the big cheats will be here, and then who knows but it may be too late ?\" \" Right\u2014 right!\" cried the others, as they tu- multuously rose from the chairs and stools on which they were seated,\u2014 \" right I\u2014 he is right 1 Let's set about it at once!\" \" At once 1\" said Wild, to himself. As he spoke, he darted along the passage, and reached the outer door. He had blown out the dip-candle that he had found alight in the room above; bnt blown out as it was, it answered his purpose better than as if it had been in full blaze. The wick was one of those that keep red and smouldering while a portion of it lemains above He spoke to the waterman. \" If I wanted to go to France, what wonld be the best way?\" \" Dover, your honour. There's no end of craft there to take you across the Channel: but in the Medway, down yonder, there's always something going to some of tho French ports.\" \" No ; Dover for me.\" Jonathan Wild felt that he was strong and ca pable on land, but a sea-voyage of any length he had a reasonable dread of. The boat shot np to a little, old, dilapidated landing-place at Greenwich. Wild stepped on shore. \" Two shillings, yonr honour.\" \"Oh, two shillings! Html Wait half a minute, my man, and I will come back to you \" Wild walked np the wooden steps, and turned into a narrow street. A glare of light came from a public-house, and from the door of which a man staggered down the street. He had the air and appearance of a master mariner, and as he went he muttered some snatches of a sea-ditty. All that Jonathan Wild could hear of it were the words, \"Blow high, blow low.\" \" Sir I\" said Wild, as he touched the man on the arm. \" Sir 1\" \" What now, mate ? A pirate, I take it Boarders ahoy !\" \" Have you any money?\" \" Lots, and mean to keep it, too 1\" The short bludgeon descended on the head of the mariner, and he fell to the ground as if shot through the heart or brain. With a dexterity that was quite professional, Jonathan Wild rifled his pockets. A small canvas bag that was heavy with gold soon found its way from the unfortunate matte mariner's pocket to Jonathan's. the grease- Jonathan Wild laid the candle down on to the thin train of gunpowder, so that that still red, incandescent wick touched it There was a flash of flame. A light like a will-o'-the-wisp ran down the passage. Then Wild found himself on the other side of the way \u2014 how, he knew not Then he went back to the boat. The concussion of tbe air in the passage of the house, incidental to the explosion of the httle keg cf powder, had produced that effect. A roar ! A clap of thunder ! A crashing sonnd 1 The outer door of Wild's house was thrown off The waterman hud lit a lantern, and was hang ing it to the bow of the wherry, as the night was pitchy dark. \" There's your money, and good night !\" cried Wild, as he pitched a guinea into the boat \" Good night, your honour. Lord bless ns, Bill, it's a guinea 1 His honour must be some great nobleman I\" Wild laughed to himself \u2014 one of his hideous laughs \u2014 and then, when, aa usual, it abruptly vanished, he said, \" I mean to be \u2014 I mean to be, in good time \u2014 I mean to be 1\" its hinge. What had happened in tbe kitchen Jonathan did not want to see or to imagine. The effect must have been terrible and disas trous \"That will do. I think,\" said Jonathan, as he He made his way into the old High Street of"], [277, "EDITH HERON. 271 Greenwich, and seeing a lamp which was close to the entrance of a livery Btables, he rung the ostler's bell. \" Remember, then, that yon have now a son ; and that it is for his sake the coronet of Whit combe should not be allowed either to rust forever or to fall into unworthy hands.\" Heron was silent \" A good road hack,\" he said. \" I want to hire one that will take a journey of fifty miles, or thereabouts, and back to this place.\" \" Oh, yea ; if you leave the value, and let ns have the horse back sound, wind and limb.\" \" Of course.\" \" Come,\" added the young Earl, \" I am sure that I have touched your own secret thoughts. I feel confident that upon reflection, you will think as I think npon this matter.\" \" It may be so.\" \" That, Heron, is an admission that it is eo ; and now you must permit me, in all things appertain ing to your peerage, to act for you a3 yonr friend.\" A horse was brought ont that Jonathan saw would not suit him in the least- He shook his head. \" Lor,' sir, a capital nag, this ! You would have to leave thirty guineas on him, I can tell you!\" \" Won't do. Look at his feet !\" \"Do so \u2014 do so; but there is nothing.

Yon will always know and feel that you have a true friend in me ; that you need look no further than your wishes as regards what you want me at any time to do.\" The ostler grinned. \" Well, I supposes you do happen to know one o\u00bbs from another. Here, Jem, bring the roan. Bring her out, Jem. You will have, sir, to leave e, matter of fifty ponnda on the roan.\" \" I don't mind that.\" \"Then here you are, 6ir!\" \u25a0 Ah ! this, I think, will suit.\" Wild mounted the roan horse, which he had seen at a glance was a good roadster, although no great beauty in point of looks. \" Walk with me down the road a little,\" he said to the ostler, \" and then I shall find if the girths and stirrnps are all right.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The ostler accompanied Wild from the yard. Wild put the horse to a fast walk, then to a trot \"Hoy!\u2014 hoy I Stop, sir!\" \" Good night !\" said Wild. He gave the horse an open-handed blow on the shoulder, and a d'_* with his heel. Off set the roan at a gallop, leaving the discon solate ostler looking after it in vain. \" I know it \u2014 I know it ! And now, I suppose, you really mean to leave ns ?\" \" I must\u2014 I must I\" \" And yet it is with regret ? \" \" It is \u2014 it is ! I confess that I am romantic enough to see a thousand charms in the life you here lead amid these beautiful trees. Bnt I have duties, and mnst not think of them.\" Heron blew a call on his whistle that hung from his neck. Tom Ripon immediately made his appearance. \"The horses, Tom!\" \"Yes, Captain!\" Tom dived again among the trees, and in a few minutes reappeared with Daisy and a handsome light bay hunter, on which the Earl of Bridge water had ridden to Epping. \" No, no !\" eaid the Earl, \" I will not take yon from home, Whitcombe.\" \" Nay ; permit me the pleasure of seeing yon, at least, half-way upon your road. You know, I am something like a single man now, and shall be glad of a trot on the green sward and on the road.\" CHAPTER CIII. CAPTAIN HERON BIDS FAREWELL TO THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER, AND SBEKS AD VENT0RE3 ON THE ROAD. The soft and beautiful moonlight is showering down from all the crevices and small quivering openings of the trees in old Epping Forest upon the sweet green herbage beneath. Two persons are standing in the shadow cast by a huge elm tree, which looked truly a monarch of the forest as it spread its- broad branches far and wide beyond its companions. \"These two persons were in animated conversa tion, and their voices, although sufficiently low and gentle, proclaimed that they belouged to the cultivated class of society, and sounded strangely distinct amid the silence of the woodland spot. One of these persons was Captain Felix Heron himself. The other was the young Earl of Bridgewater, his fast and true friend. It was Eferon who waB speaking. \"No, no! Never again!\" he said. \"Do not seek to tempt me ever again to try to breathe the atmosphere of a Court I have tried it once, and find how unwholesome it is to me !\" \" But you should think of others,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" You are not the man to bound all yonr thoughts, aud confine all your actions, to considerations of sols.\" \"No, no! My enemies canneJ say that of me!\" Tbe Earl of Bridgewater, to tell the truth, was only too well pleased to have Heron with him for a few miles, and he made no further opposi tion. Heron, however, was not prepared to take Tom Ripon with him, and when the latter joined them on the outskirts of the forest mounted and equipped for the road, Heron was disposed to order him back. The Earl of Bridgewater, however, interposed in Tom's favour. \" Let him come, Whitcombe,\" he said ; \" I shall be better pleased, when we do part, that you have one of your faithful followers to ride back with.\" Upon this, Tom, to his great delight, was per mitted to follow, which he did at a distance that, while it enabled him to keep Captain Heron and the Earl in sight was yet not sufficiently close to make him any check upon their confidential con versation. The Earl of Bridgewater was quite of opinion that the recent advent\"-- Jr- -oihich Lord Clack."], [278, "EDITH HERON. 272 know the meaning of the strange wailing cries that had come npon the night air.

I wish you now to return to your woodland home and to Edith.\" \" Good night, theu ; and a thousand good wishes go with yon !\" \" Tbe same to you. with all my heart, Heron! Good night! good night! You hear that I some times call you Heron, and someiimes Whitcombe. Pray ex;usemein either case that you like the least I\" \" Call me ever what you will, so that my place in your heart never changes.\" The Earl rode off; and at the corner of the verdant lane where they pirted, Felix Heron reined up D_isy, and took a long look about him, over hill and dale. \"Come down from the tree, Tom, and follow me. The distance, I should think, cannot t*> above half a mile to the gipsy camp, and we will ride to it.\" \" All's right, Captain !\" Tom was mounted again in a few seconds; and ho and Captain Heron picked his way as bent tbey could across tbe country to wards the gipsies' fire. The route was tolerably easy, and as they neared the spot where tho blazo of the fire was visible, they got into a narrow, shadowy lane, which led directly the way they wished to go. Once, and once only, as they were about half way down this lane, they heard again the strange sounds that had at first attracted their attention. \" There, Tom !\" cried Heron, who had been so intently listening for a repetition of tbe sounds that, when he did hear them, he was half afraid fancy had conjured them up, \u2014 \"there, Tom, did you hear that?\" \"Yes, Captain.\" \"What was it?\" Tom Ripon rode np. \"Captain, do you hear nothing odd ?\" said Tom. \"Nothing. Do you?\" \" Well, 1 thought I did, Captain. There it is Again ! I cannot make out what it is. It sounds like \u2014 like \" \" Somebody in some trouble.\" \" And where did you think it sounded from ?\" \" Right away by the gipsies' fire, I should say, Captain \" \" Come on, then ; let us put our cattle so speed.\" Abont six or seven minutes now brought Tom Ripon and Felix Heron to the end of the shadowy lane, and they emerged from it on to an extensive commo. \" Hueb, Tom\u2014 hush !\" Captain Heron list-tied ; and, coming from ap parently a long distance on the night air, he heard a strange wailing sound, which was to his percep tions decidedly human in its character, and indica tive of distress of tome sort This common was, at short intervals, covered with stunted brushwood, and towards one corner of it, a little to the right hand of the entrance to the shadowy lane, there was a group of very tall and beautiful trees. \"Tom! Tom!\" \" Yes, Captain !\" \"Did you hear it!\" \" Oh, yes, Captain !\" \" Well, what do you make of it ?\" \" I don't know ; but if you will make Daisy take two steps to this side, you will see something a good way off yonder that looks like fire !\" Heron made the movement suggested by Tom Ripon, and then he saw, at a considerable distance, in the midst of brushwood and trees, the fitful glare of a fire of some sort Among those trees, even by the faint Iigh\\ aided, to be sure, by the reflection from the gip sies' fire, Heron conld see that there was a building of some sort But it was only a transient glance that he cast npon the gronp of trees aud the building that they surrounded. It was the gipsies' encampment which attracted him, and he approached it at a walking pace. Daisy picked her way cautiously among the furze and the brushwood, and Heron had full time to look at the scene he was approaching. There seemed to be some ten or twelve swarthy figures busy about the fire, over which, fr_m a tripod of sticks, hung a kettle, nodoubtfnll enough of some savoury mess. A covered cart Tbe possibility that some lone house or mansion might be on fire, gave Felix Heron one of thoee sudden flushes of sympathetic alarm which no possible danger of his own could have produced. \" Tom, Tom !\" he said, \" you must cl mb into a tree, and try to get a further look than I can take from the back of Daisy.\" This was a proposition that just suited Tom Ripon ; and he tied the bridle of his horse to a low-hanging bough of a chesnut tree, while he himself clambered up into the thick foliage. \" What do you see, Tom?\" \" Nothing, Captain. Oh, yes, I do now ! Some one, I think, was standing before the fire; but now I can see quite well there are a number of people, and the fire is low down on the ground. 1 think I can see a cart and some tents, too.\" \" Then all that can be said, Tom,\" said Heron, \"is that we have taken alarm at an encampm.it of gipsies.\" '\u2022 That's it, Captain !'' Both Tom Ripon and Felix Heron felt now cer tain that they had hit upon tbe ri-bt explanation of the mysterious fire in the shrubberies ; but still that explanation stopped short of letting them A hotse. Two donkeys. A t\u00bbnt of rather unusual size. These were the prominent objects of the en campment. \" Hilloa !\" cried Heron, as he came near enough to be heard. \" What sort of entertainment ia there here for man and beast ?\" No sooner had he spoken, than with shouts of alarm the whole of the persons in the camp f\u00bbced towards him, and for a few seconds he saw tne gleam of kuives in their hands. Captain Heron was surprised enough, as well he might be, at this hostile demonstration on tbe part of the gipsies, for he had never before found that they were so very averse to the chance visit of a stranger, however much they, to speak collo quially, \" kept themselves to themselves.\""], [279, "EDITH HEKON 273 He halted. Then there was a hissing sound, and a volume of smoke aud steam came from the tire, as some large quantity of water waa thrown upon it. Darkness immediately shrouded tbe spot. Tha cart, the horse, the two donkeys, the tent, the gipsies, and the tripod over the fire, all seemed to disappear from eight, and the common appeared to be solely in possession of Captain Heron and of Tom Ripon. Then, before they could either of them speak or make any movement, there came again a wailing, screaming ory, such as they had heard afar off, but which, now that they were evidently closer to its source, sounded most lamentably distressful. \" On, Daisy, on !\" cried Heron. Daisy made one of her bold leaps, and Heron found himself close to the deserted and still smoul dering embers of the fire. \" A friend \u2014 a friend !\" he cried. \" The word ?\" shouted a voice from among the gipsies. \"A friend, I say!\" A loud, shrill whistle sounded with such inten sity, that it must have been heard to a great dis tance. Heron called out again. \" Believe me, I am a friend, and do not approach your encampment with any other than the most kindly feelings towards you.\" Tom Ripon was close to Captain Heron and Daisy, and he went the length of laying his hand upon the arm of Heron, as he said, \" Oh, Cap tain I I never found any gipsies behave just like these.\" Before these words were well past the lips of Tom Ripon, there came upon the air one clear note, apparently upon a bugle. \" Stand, Daisy, stand !\" Daisy was still as a rock, while Captain Heron, No. 35. \u2014 Edith."], [280, "274 EDITH HERON. having hastily dismounted, raked together the embers of the fire with the end of his riding whip. Ho then took tho lautern from Tom Ripon, and leading Daisy by the bridle, he slowly moved onwards in the direction of the low rippling sound ot falling waters. Guided by that pleasant, dreamy kind of sound, Heron soon came to the brink of a narrow rivu let, whioh traversed the common. The flames soon revived again, and tho dark ness was as soon dissipated over the common. There was a tripod that had supported the kettle upset, and the kettle gone. There was the covered cart. It was, however, not possible for the rivulet, in its passage through the half-sand, half-gravel soil of the common, to make the noise he heard. To discover the cause of that, it was necessary to follow the couree of the rivulet. There was the tent. But the animala and the gipsies had myste riously disappeared. That is say, none were to be seen, although She tent and the covered cart might prove to bo ihe hiding-place of the whole. Such, however, was not the case. A slight but amply sufficient examination of the oart and the tent was conclusive. It ended at the foot of the clump of tall trees. There was aome ancient atone-work, two or three steps of descent, and it seemed as if the ri vulet ended at that spot by disappearing in the earth, where a little stone baain had been placed, so that it was always full of water, and at the same time always overflowing. \" That's all !\" said Tom Ripon. \" I am not quite sure, Tom.\" \"Oh, yes! Come away, Captain.\" \" Wait a moment. Stand, Daisy I\" Captain Heron descended the three or four stone steps \"by the side of the little overflowing basin. No living creature was to be seen. Captain Heron leant upon his saddle and patted Daisy's neok abstractedly, as he spoke to Tom Rt-pon. Tom himself was quite scared. \" Well, Tom, what do you think of all this, eh?\" \" I think, Captain, that the darkest and dampest hole in Epping Forest is ever so much better than this common ; and down that lane, over yonder, will be the proper way.\" \" It is mysterious and strange, beyond all pre cedent,\" said Heron. As he spoke, he heard a sound that was like the rippling of water. \" Don't\u2014 don't, Captain!\" cried Tom. \"For goodness gracious sake, don't go down there !\" \" There is no danger, Tom.\" \" We don't know that, Oaptain.\" \"Ah I I see!\" \"What?\u2014 oh, what?\" \" Wait a little where you are, Tom.\" \" But, Captain \" \" Hush ! \u2014 hush I Make no noise !\" CHAPTER CIV. Captain Heron, to the great terror of Tom Ripon, disappeared before his eyes, seeming, so far aa he could aee, to scramble through the little basin of water, and to go down some deep hole on the other side of it. i GAPTADI HERON FINDS THAT HIS SKILL IN PHY- SIOGNOMY DOES NOT DECEIVE HIM. Under the mysterions circumstances in which he was placed, any sound that might disturb the stillness of the common was likely to possess a special interest to Captain Heron. When therefore, the light, splashing, trickling noise came upon his ears, he called out to Tom, \" Silence, and listen.\" They both kept profoundly still for the space of about five minutes, during whioh they heard quite distinctly the sounds indicative of the proximity of water in some shape. \" If we could only get hold of anything, Tom,\" said Heron, \" that wonld act as a torch to ns, we might make some discovery. Look for some thing I\" \" Here you are, Captain.\" \" What is it, Tom ?\" \" An old lantern, with about an inch of thick candle-end in it. I stumbled over it.\" Then there was a cry of alarm from same one, and a scuffling in the water, and Heron emerged, bringing with him, fast by the collar, a lad about fifteen years of age. It did not take a second glance to let Heron and Tom see that this lad was a gipsy. Heron, when he got his prisoner quite clear of the water, and on to the comm\u00a9n, flung him down upon the grass, and said, coolly, \" Take care of him, Tom.\" \"Oh, I'll do that? Will you bo quiet\u2014 eh? Will you?\" The gipsy boy bit at Tom, \"Oh, that's the game, is it? Daisy, take his head off !\" This was au expression Tom Ripon was in the habit of using when at play with Daisy in Epping Forest, and which he further carried out by placing his cap on a stump of tree, os anything that would support it. On this occasion Tom Ripon placed his cap on the gipsy's head, and Daisy made a bite at it, which not only secured the cap, but brought away a good quantity of the rather luxuriant hair of the gipsy. With a yell of fear, the gipsy lad fell to the ground, and gave up all idea of opposition. \" Now are you aU right ?\" asked Tom. \" Oh, yes ! No \u2014 yes\u2014 no !\" \" Will you bite any more ?\" \"No, no I\" \"Come, my boy,\" said Horon. \" Where does that place lead to ?\" He pointed to the stone steps down whioh the \" The very thing, Tom!\" Tom Ripon knelt down by the fire to light the lantern, and while he did so Captain Heron spoke aloud. \" There can be no reason,\" he said, \" why gipsies should hide themselves from me. I am the last man in England who, under any circum stances, would seek to be an enemy to them or theirs, and I am in no way connected with the ownership of this soil, that I should wish to dis turb them.\" \" Here's the light, Captain !\" \"Hnsh! hush!\" Heion wished to pause a little, to b9 certain that no response came to his words. But all was stilL water was trickling."], [281, "EDITH HERON. 275 \" To Osmanli,\" was the reply. It was not very comprehensible ; but the boy evidently spoke quite ingenuously, and looked in the face of Heron so clearly, that the latter felt disposed to put trnst in him. \" What is your name, my lad ?\" \" Zad.\" Heron nodded. \"Theories,\" addeo! the boy, \"came from the young girl.\" \"What young giri?\" \" I don't know her. I only know that she was taken out of the Old Oak Farm-house, and that she is aa fair as an a_igel.\" \" Oh, dear !\" said Tom. \" Her eyes are like the stars of heaven, and her hair streams far and wide, as though all the silk of the East had centribnted a golden hair to make it np.\" \"Oh ( oh!\" \"Zadwhat?\" \" Nothing else.\" \" You are a gipsy ?\" \" Yes ; but not of this tribe.\" \"Which tribe?\" \" This \u2014 thia that waa here. I don't like them ; they ill-nse me, often ; and I am a gipsy, it ia true, but I don't want to be a thief. This is a bad tribe.\" \" Her cheeks shame the blush rose ; and her teeth, like little pearls, seem as if they had fallen accidentally in two charming rows into a half blown rose-bud.\" While the boy spoke, Captain Heron looked keenly into his eyes. It had always been the custom with Heron through life, so far as he had travelled on that journey, to trust very mnch to his own observa tion of the countenances of people with whom he came into contact. \" Oh, don't !\" cried Tom Ripon\u2014\" don't ! That will do !\" \" What is the matter with you, Tom ?\" asked Captain Heron. \"Oh, nothing, Captain\u2014 nothing! But I am rather given to fall in love lately ; and I think I shall with that girl, with the roses, and the pearls, and the silk hair, and all that sort of thing.\" \" Well, Tom, you may fall in love as much as you like ; but for the present be so good aa to keep quiet.\" \"Yes, Captain!\" \" Now, Zad, what more have you to tell me ?\" \" It was midnight when the tribe got round the Old Oak Farm. Two of them \u2014 Melathon and Horeb \u2014 climbed up to the window of the girl's room, by the honeysuckles and the old ivy ; and there was no cry. They brought her down with them, handing her from one to the other, and she seemed to sleep, or to be dead.\" \"When was that?\" Very rarely indeed was he ever deceived to any great extent in such conclusions in regard to cha racter. And now, as regarded this boy, there waa a something which very much pleaaed and inte rested Heron in hia looks. \" Well, my boy,\" he said, \" suppose you were to have nothing further to do with the bad tribe?\" \" They will not let me go.\" \" But I will protect you.\" \" Ah, then I should be free ; for I have seen myself in your eyes !\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" My mother was a true Zingaro of the old Moorish stock ; and she told me that whenever a stranger spoke words of seeming kindness to me, to look into his eyes, and if I saw myself there for the space that you might cjunt ten, I might believe him.\" \" Last night.\" \" What happened then ?\" \" She was put into the cart aud brought to this common, and then Horeb's mother went to London. After that the tribe fed the girl on milk and fruit ; but ehewould weep, and wait and cry. Bat to night Horeb's mother came back, and there was great rejoicing, and the girl was taken do wn the atone steps to Osmanli.\" \" Is that all you know ?\" \" It is\u2014 except that they were all alarmed when they heard you coming. Some water was thrown on to the fire, and they all fled down the steps, leaving me as a scout to warn them of danger.\" \" And that is all ?\" \" And you have done that to me?\" \" I have.\" \" And so yon will truat me ?\" \" With all my heart !\" \" Come, then ! Can you jump ?\" The lad smiled. Heron pointed to the back of Daisy, behind the saddle ; and with wonderful dexterity the gipsy boy, with a short run, just lightly placed his hand npon Daisy, and lit upon her back. \" That will do,\" said Heron. \" Now, lie quite flat.\" \" It is.\" There was much in this statement to induce re flection in the mind of Felix Heron ; but yet there was not quite enough in it to enable him to decide at once what to do. The gipsy boy understood him well, and enabled Heron to mount without incommoding him, by lying flat on hia baok for a few seconds. \"Off, and away!\" cried Heron. Daisy bounded ever the common. \"Halt!\" Daisy stood still as the statne of a horse. \" Good gracious !\" cried Tom Ripon, as he rode up; \" what's it all about, Oaptain ?\" \" You will hear, Tom, very likely, if yon listen. Now, Zad, tell me what was the meaning of those strange cries I heard awhile ago on the common, and what yon mean by saying that the tribe had gone to Osmanli ?\" \" I will. Osmanli ia the name of that house among the trees.\" \" It is atrange, Tom,\" he said, \" that I sesm to be now, from time to time, called upon to succour the distressed. I am afraid the band will not find such a course very profitable.\" \" Hark, Captain I What is that ?\" \"What, Tom?\" \" A carriage on the common !\" There could be no doubt in a few minutes more. of the fact that a carriage of some sort was coming across the wide, open space. A road \u2014 not a very good one, but still a road \u2014 crossed the common, and from it diverged a number of tracks, cut by the wheels of vehicles, and trodden into the semblance of cross roads by the hoofs of horses. \" Oh, that is it 1\" \" Yes ; and there is a way to reach a grotto in its gardens down the steps of the spring head yonder, where you found me.\" The approaching carriage turned off what might te called the high road, into one of these tracks."], [282, "276 EDITH HERON. I The flash of its light soon proclaimed that it waa a carriage of some pretensions, although it was only drawn by two horses, and there waa no postilion. Two horses and two postilions were considered the proper thing in thoso days. \" Stay where you are, Tom I\" said Heron. \" I will see what carriage that is ; and as I am on the road, I may perhaps satisfy to-night both myself and my men.\" Captain Heron did not give Tom Ripon any directions in regard to the young gipsy lad. He had faith that the lad would not attempt to leave him was left entirely to oonjecture. At all events, he might be supposed to be a very great man, for he did not condescend to make any reply whatever. Then Captain Heron appeared at the coach window, and resting a pistol on the ledge ef it, he said quietly, \" Who fired those shots ?\" \" Missed him, by heaven I\" cried a voice. Then Heron recognised the speaker, who, to his surprise, was no other than Lord Clackington. The person by his side, whom he had addressed aa excellency, was attired in a magnificent Oriental robe, and upon hia head he wore a kind of shawl turban, which waa most artistically twisted round and round his brows, leaving one end, to which waa attached some costly bullion fringe, hanging below the left ear, and almost touching his shouldera. PuttiDg Daisy to a canter, Heron went across the common to meet the carriage with the lamps. The complexion of this personage, and the look of calm and placid repose up >n hia face, would have been quite sufficient to stamp him as an Oriental. CHAPTER OV. Indeed, at a second glance, Felix Heron per fectly recollected that he had eeen him at the Court of St. James'a, on that last occasion of his visit there, and that he was no other than the Turkish Ambassador. AN ADVENTURE ON THE COMMON CONDUCTS HERON TO A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT. The route whioh Heron took would soon bring him up with the carriage obliquely, and he cantered over the soft apringing turf of the com mon, until he was within about thirty feet of the vehicle, and then he shouted out in a loud, clear, ringing voice, \" Hold ! Stand or die 1\" The coachman's only reply was to commence lashing his horses. Heron then drew one of hia holster pistols, and fired it in the air. Heron, before riding up to the coach, had put on the h-If-crape mask that he generally wore on such occasions, and altering his voice now as much as possible, he said, \" Lord Clackington, I will trouble you for your money and valuables ; aud his Excellency the Turkish Ambassador can not expect to escape under a heavy ransom.\" \"By George, he knows who we are ! \" oried Lord Clackington. Tha Ambassador said not a word, but looked as steady as a rook. \" Come, my lord, be quick !\" oried Heron ; \" my pistols have an objection to remain in an explo sive condition more than five minutes at a time.\" The coachman dropped his whip, and began to pull at the reins with both hands, so that he quickly subdued the gallop he had got the horses into, and brought the coach to a standstill. Then Heron rode up. \" Have mercy upon me !\" cried the coachman. \" I didn't mean not to stop, sir, if you please. It was the 'osses pulled me on, sir ! Oh, dear, spare my life I\" Heron paid not the slightest attention to these remonstrances from the coachman, but he rode at once to the side of the coach nearest to him. \" There, then 1\" Lord Claukington handed out a purse that was deoidedly lanky and thin, and contained, perhaps, five guineas at the utmost. \"Nonsense, my lord 1\" said Heron ; \" I am not to be put off in this way. But if you prefer my making you a present of a little hot lead, smoked by gunpowder, to a fair surrender of what you have to give, I cannot have any objection.\" \" Stop ! stop !\" \" Be quick, then 1\" \" There\u2014 there! Confound you, that ia all I have ! Take it I\" He never exactly knew what was the reason of the sudden impulse that came over him, to be more cautious than usual on that occasion, but such a feeling did come over him. It was commonly the habit of Captain Heron, under similar circumstances to the present, to ride fearlessly to tbe door of any vehicle, and take his chance of any resistance being offered. Now, however, he acted differently. He paused a pace from the coach window, and struck it with his riding whip. A couple of pistol shots immediately came from the interior of the carriage, and if Heron had been exactly before the door, his chances or Daisy'a chancea of being hit would have been great indeed. \" Your watch I\" said Heron, as he took the well-filled pocket-book Lord Clackington handed to him. With a groan, the watch was produoed. \" And now,\" added Heron, \" for hia Excel- lency !\" Lord Clackington turned to tha Ambassador, and said, in irritated aocents, \" I am afraid, your Excellency, that it will be necessary to give this \u2014 this \" Felix Heron would have mentally felt a wound to Daisy to the full as much as he would one to himself. \" Civility, my lord, if you please!\" Baid Heron. \" Well, well, this gentleman some money and jewels.\" \" Kismet !\" said the Turk. \" I think,\" ,said a voice. \" your excellency had him there. He! hei he!\" There was something about the voice which Captain Heron thought he knew, and there was something 6till more about the chuckle that fol lowed the spoken words which he was certain ho had a recollection of. Aa he spoke, he handed a small embroidered bag to Heron. It was v?ell filled with gold ; and as the object of Felix Heron at that time was rather to delude Clackington into the belief that he was a common highwayman, whose great wish would be to get aa great a distance as possible from the common as soon aa he had effected a good robbery, he pretended to be satisfied. But where he had heard the voice and the laugh, he could uot at the moment determine. Who the excellency waa that had been addressed"], [283, "EDITH HERON. 277 \" Very good!\" he said. \"I have now the ho nour, gentlemen, of bidding yon good night ; but if ever you come aorosa this common again, may I be here to see yon.\" Tnrning Daisy'a head from the coach, Felix Heron trotted off in the darkness, and regained Tom Ripon and the yonng gipsy \"Any lnck, Captain?\" asked Tom. \" Oh, yes ! Take care, and keep low down, so that your head may not be seen against the night sky.\" \" Oh, won't I ! I suppose a few more bullets are a-going to fly about, Captain ? One came over here to look after ns.\" alarm, waa only brought to a standstill by Felix Heron anatching at the bridle of the horse. \" Stand, sir, for your life's sake 1\" \" Oh, Lord I Have mercy upon me, good Mr. Highwayman ! Spare m7 unhappy life I I am only Jones, sir, a poor valet, if you please, and have no money !\" \"Whose valet?\" \"My Lord Olackington's, if you please, Mr. Highwayman.\" \" And what valise is that you have behind you on the horse ?\" \" My maater's, sir. I was to ride after him here to Osmanli House, yonder among the trees. He is a terrible man, my master, and I would advise you not only to let mo go quickly, but to get out of this neighbourhood as soon as you can.\" The valet waa all of a tremble as he gave this advice to Felix Heron, and there could be no doubt but that he thought the highwayman a much more terrible mau than his master, the dis sipated and cowardly Lord Olaokington. Heron coolly took the valet by the collar with Ihe left hand, and put the muzzle of a pistol to his ear with the right. \" Tom,\" he said, \" you see to the horse. It may take fright when I shoot this fellow.\" The valet uttered a shout of fear. \"Indeed, Tom?\" \" Oh, yes ! It bleeds still.\" \"What? what?\" \" The corner of my left ear, Captain. A bullet came light along the oommon, and took off the end of it aa neat as may be ; but it don't much matter, aa I don't think I shall ever take to wear ing ear-rings\" \" Then yon have had a narrow escape, Tom ?\" \" A miss is aa good aa a mile, Captain.\" \"True, Tom; but my design is now to watch that coach.\" They all three now kept their eyes upon the vehicle, which, after continuing for a short space on the high road across the common, turned then on to one of the by-roads over the grass, and finally disappeared among the trees, which were so luxuriantly growing round the honse that Zad, the young gipsy, had named so strangely \" Os manli.\" \" Oh, don't \u2014 don't ! What do you want ? Take the valise \u2014 take anything, but spare my wretched life I\" \" I should have no objection to spare your life,\" said Heron, \" were it not that I can perceive you are one of those determined men who would rather die than tell all that I require to be informed of.\" The only possible explanation of this name seemed to suggest itself in the connexion of the Turkish Ambassador with the place. When the lighta of the carriage had entirely disappeared, Captain Heron turned to the young gipsy, and spoke. \" Zad, can you tell me if you ha ve e ver seen a r_tan with a shawl round his head, and looking like a Turk?\" \" No, no I\" shrieked the valet \" I am not one of those determined men ! I never was I I am a poor creature, and always was !\" \" No, no !\" \" But I tell you lam! A cat would get the better of me I I am a coward \u2014 I am indeed ; and I am willing to tell all I know, and more too, if you will only take that dreadful pistol away from mv ear !\" \" Speak, then.\" \" I will, I will ! Hem !\" \u00ab Quick !\" \" Yes\u2014 oh, yea !\" \" Where, Zad ?\" \" He ia the master.\" \"Of thathonae?\" \" Yes. But there is another master, too. He is one ; the other is a man with a wig.\" That this waa Lord Clackington, Felix Heron had no donbt whatever. \" Yes, yes I My master, Lord Clackington, mt-kes himself useful to the Turkish ambassador in looking about for pretty girls. When he finds one, he gets a gang of gipsies that are in hia pay to take her off, either by day or by night, aa they best can, and she is brought to that bonee, which belongs to tho Ambassador, and which is called Osmanli House.\" To pursue this adventure, however, further \u2014 and he, Heron, was quite resolved to do so \u2014 re quired some consideration. That the whole force, if it might be called such, of the gipsies was in and abont the house, he could not doubt ; and although he, Heron, had bat httle fear of failing in overcoming such a crew, yet he shrank from the possible necessity of commit ting havoo among them. In the midst of these doubts, the clatter of a horse's feet waa heard upon the common. \" Captain I Captain !\" cried Tom Ripon, \" do let me have a chance!\" Heron could not doubt for one moment that the valet was telling the exact truth, since it agreed so well with what Zad, the gipsy boy, had already related to him. \" Oo on,\" he said. \" If you please, Mr. Highwayman, that ia all I know.\" \" Is any poor victim at the house now ?\" \"I should say yes, sir, or eise I wouldn't be ordered to come here to-night\" \" What does the valise contain ?\" \" Why, sir, it\u2014 it contains some clothes of my lord's.\" \" A chance of what, Tom ? \u2014 of another bullet at your ear ?\" \" Oh, no ; but I want to try my luck again, as I waa not very lucky two nighta ago, and there is a horseman on the common.\" \" What clothes ?\" \" Why, you see, Mr. Highwayman, he takes aupper with the Turkish Ambassador, and he dresses himself too Uke a Turk ; and while the gipsy women and men dance, and some of them play\" on the guitar, and castanets, and tambour- \" You are too rash, Tom. Stay where you are !\" These words could hardly be said to be well past Heron's lips when tbe horseman rode quite into ihe midst of the little party, and then making a sudden effort to turn, with an expression of"], [284, "278 EDITH HERON. ine,the girls are brought in and made to drink wine.\" \" Enough, enough !\" cried Heron. \" I can well comprehend that some terrible orgies take place in that house, and that it will be my pleasure to put a stop to them.\" \" Oh, oh, oh !\" \" What's the matter ?\" T he valet pointed over the common, and Heron, looking in that direction, saw a couple of moving lights of a bright crimson colour. \" What ia that ?\" If you linger here another minute, you are a dead man!\" The valet waa only too glad to take his depar ture ; and he did so with a spirit that soon carried him and his horse far away from the spot. The valise, though, remained still on the ground. In the darkness now, whioh had much increased, it looked like a black bundle, withont make or shape ; and that darkness waa aoon to a degree dissipated. Zad, the gipsy boy, knew where to find matches in the deserted tent of his people ; and he soon placed another bit of candle in the lantern at the disposal of Heron, who thought it wiser to go into the gipsy's tent now, to make hia arrangements, than to attempt to do so in the open air on the common. \"Oh, Mr. Highwayman, I am indeed now a ruined valet !\" \" What do you mean ? Speak out, or this mo ment ia your last !\" \" I will speak \u2014 I will ! Life is sweet ; ansl what are lords, and ambassadors, and kings to a man with a bullet in hia brain, I ahould like to know ? Oh, dear! oh, dear! he ia coming! I thought he would ! If I didn't think he would !\" \" Zad,\" said Heron, \" I think you will be faith ful to me ?\" \" On my head be it I\" \" Then of course you had some kind of watch word, which would enable any one to pass your guard without alarm at that secret mode of going into the house yonder by the water-steps ?\" \" Yes. It waa ' Crown.' \" \"Who?\u2014 who?\" \" His Majesty himself, good Mr. Highwayman ! He, too, comes to Osmanli.\" \" Then I want you to resume your post, and I will pass by that way into the house. This dis guise, I fancy, will excite nothing but respect.\" Captain Heron had opened the valise, and he fonnd that it contained some very rich Oriental robes, scarfs, and shawls. These, no doubt, were the portions of Eastern costume vrhich the Lord Clackingtou meant to as sume in compliment to the Turkish Ambassador. Heron was not then aware that Lord Clacking ton had been, for many years of his vicious life, the British Ambassador at Constantinople, where he had picked up many of the loose and immoral habits of the Turka. CHAPTER CVI. CAPTAIN HERON FINDS AN ORIENTAL MYSTERY IN THE FREE AIR OF OLD ENGLAND. The two bright crimson lights rapidly approached over the common. They were so coloured from the fact that the carriage lamps were provided with deeply-stained glass of that beautiful tint. No doubt this waa done for the purpose of re cognition at a distance. If we say, now, that Captain Heron waa for a short time in a state of indecision bow to act, we do not mean for one moment to intimate that he faltered in his intention to rescue the young crea ture who had been torn from her home to be made the victim of the cruel passions of the persons en gaged iu the infamous transaction. His only doubt was as regarded the mode he should adopt as most effectual to do the good ho desired. When Felix Heron put on the robes he pre sented a magnificent appearance, and there could be no doubt that he would be successful in passing himself upon the gipsies as one of the accredited and dissolute visitors of Osmanli House. Zad took up hia post again at the stone steps in tbe water. \" I suppose I have bnt to pass boldly en,\" eaid Heron. While Captain Heron thus reflected, the carriage with the bright crimson lights diverged from the high road, even as the other had done, and ap proached the house among tho trees. Then Felix Heron made up his mind what to do. \" That ia all, master. The water will rise to your knees, and then you will ascend from it, and then you will come into the grotto of the garden.\" \" That is well. I trust to you as I would to one in whom I had the confidence of years of ex perience.\" \" You may, master.\" It was with a feeling of great curiosity that Heron descended tbe steps into the water, but all was as Zad had said, and in two or three minutes he found himself in a pretty and picturesque grotto, which was lit by one star-like lamp in a glass covering of a golden tint. From what he, Heron, could see of the garden about him, it was one on which nothing had been spared to make it all that tha climate of England wonld admit of. He took Tom Ripon a little on one side, and spoke to him seriously. \" Tom, you will take Daisy by the bridle, and you will ride back to Epping Forest at once.\" \" What, Captain, and leave you?\" \" Just so. You will then bring back with you to this spot, and close to the trees yonder, Ogle and four of the band whom he will select Go, now, at once, and obey orders.\" The tone in which Heron uttered the last words let Tom feel that he had nothing to do but to obey as quickly as possible ; and he did so. \" Yes, Captain ; I'm off.\" Heron was now alone, and on foot on the com mon. Beautiful flowers and shrubs that bore thousands of buds aud blossoms, were to be met with at every turn. From tho branches of the treea, np the tiuul\u00bb of which they were trained, hung down in long feathery festoons, specimens of io\u00bb,ny a climbing and creeping plant, then scarcely known in England. Alone so far as regarded any help from his own men ; but not alone, in so far as he had with him that indomitable courage and energy which formed prominent featured of his character. He spoke firmly to the valet. \"Mount your horse, sir, aud be off lo London I The paths were covered with the finest sifted"], [285, "279 EDITH THE CAPTIVE. gravel, so that they were as even as tha most deli cate sands of the sea-shore to walk upon. The night air was laden with the perfume of many flowers, that only gave forth their sweetest odours in the stillness of the night. Indeed, the place was one of many delights and enchantmenta to the senses, and Heron waa some what surprised that men who were mere volup tuaries could care bo much for the beantiea of the floral world. long curtains of the window, close to him, ia order to escape immediate detection. Two persons came into the room. They were both men. One was in a Court dress. Bowing low to the floor, the man in the Court dress spoke to the other, who was in Oriental robes. \" Oh, your Majesty will be enchanted. My zeal for your Majeaty'a service made me at once, the moment I looked at the young creature, see that she was too fair, too rare, too admirable to become the plaything of the leisure of the Turkish Ambassador ; and so I hope I shall receive your Majesty's full approbation for inviting you to come here and look npon her with your own royal eyes, and make her all your own.\" This was Lord Clackington who so spoke. His auditor was the King. \" Well, Clackington,\" replied the King, \" I never knew you to be so enthusiastic about any beauty before.\" Probably, however, that place waa made ao fair and so attractive in order to delude the poor vic tims of criminal passion with an idea that they had lit upon an earthly paradise. As Captain Heron traversed one of the paths the Bound of soft music came upon his ears. He paused to liston. Aa he did so two men slowly passed him, each of whom cautiously saluted him. Heron saw that they were well armed, and that they were a portion of the tribe of gipsiea who had disappeared from the common on his approach. He retnrned the salute gravely and with a cour teous action. \" I was n6ver bo justified.\" \" Be it so. The secret of these little amours, on our part, belongs only to you and to the Ambassa dor from Constantinople, who pays all the charges, and so we are safe, aa oar character for morality stands high.\" \" As it will ever stand. Why should not one so high and mighty aa your Majesty not enjoy your leienre.\" \" Well, well \u2014 where ia the girl?\" \" In the cabinet.\" In about half a minute he met two more, and then a third conple. Each of these men saluted him iu turn, and he, as with the first ones, retnrned the salute. From all this Captain Heron came to the con clusion that the place was well gnarded ; and that bnt for the Oriental costume he wore, and which no doubt waa recogniaed as the sort of thing that identified those who were to be respected and obeyed in that place, he would have had a fight for his life. \" The cabinet with the mirrora ?\" \" Yes, your Majesty.\" \" And how will you satisfy the Ambassador ?\" \" He ia now sitting on the divan and smoking. The gipsy girls are, aa usual, dancing before him, and two of the youths are playing on the guitar and small cymbals. After a time he intends to send for the fair captive.\" \"Well, and then?\" These were conditions which made Heron see the necessity of being fully upon his guard. He returned again to the grotto, and made a careful examination of hia pi.tols- By Heron's calculations, it would be about one hour and a quarter before, by any possibility, Tom Kipon conld get back again to the common with Ogle and the four members of the band sent for. During that time, what might not happen in that house ? \" Oh, your Majesty, that time will not come to night.\" \"Why not?\" \" Because I have placed in the bowl of his jewelled pipe a pill of opium, which will sorely stupefy him.\" The King laughed. \" Yon are fertile in resources, Clackington.\" \" If I were not, your Majesty-, I should have no title to act confidentially in your royal ser vice.\" He left the giotto. Towards the mansion, guided by the sound of music, he took his way. Twice again was he met by the well-armed and prowling gipsies ; but, as before, they passed him with respectful salutes. Then he ascended four marble steps, and found himself on a- terrace crowded with plants in pots, and from which a long range of windows opened apparently into the principal rooms of the house. A faint light streamed out at no less than five of those windows. \" Yon are right, Clackington, \u2014 you are right ! And, by the bye, I think you were say ing to us yesterday something about some unen closed Crown lands in Hampshire.\" \" Yes, your Majesty.\" \" Well, you shall have them \u2014 you shail have them ; and the terms shall be that once a year you present us with an Oriental robe.\" \" Your Majesty is only too good.\" \" Well, well ! Let us go now to the Hall. Those gipsy vagabonds sing and dance well, and are worth the looking at and listening to, Clack ington.\" \" They are, indeed.\" But within, the blinda were all so closely drawn down, that not the least glimpse could be got of the interior. This was not, however, the case as regarded the windows throngh which no illumination proceeded, Heron, with some difficulty, waa at length, by breaking a pane of glass carefully, able to open one of them. Then he stepped at once into the house so full of suspicion. He felt that he trod upon a soft and yielding carpet. The sound of musical instrument- came much more plainly npon hia eara; but, -before he could make any movement of importance, the door opened, and a broad flash of light came into the room where he was. Felix Heron had only time to slip behind the \" Bnt are yon quite sure our personal identity is not suspected by them V \"Oh, quite, quite!\" The fact waa that Zad knetw perfectly well that it waa the King who came: in the caniage with the crimson lights- Lord Clackington carried a lamp, and preceded the King, who suddenly them said, \" Bnt how is"], [286, "EDITH THE CAPTIVE. 280 plants and flowera the size of nature, aud so exquisitely tinted, that the idea of treading upon a flower-bed of the richest and rarest description waa kept up to tha life. it, Clackington, thut you are not in the Eastern robes ?\" . , \" That rascal of a valet of mine has ns't foii-d his way down here with the valisa containing my apparel.\" \" Discharge him, Claokington.\" \" I fully intend it.\" The King and Lord Claokington passed ont of the room, and Felix Heron was once more alone. But he had gained some information which might be useful. v No attempt waa made to fasten the >5oor through ivhich the King and Lord Clackington went, so that Heron was able to follow them slowly and cautiously. The walla were hung with rioh satin draperies. Windows there seemed to be none, or the dra peries covered them. A profusion of ottomans, all covered with pale green silk, with a profusion of gold and siver em broidery about them, furnished the apartment. The floor, too, had in places, piled up one upon another, heaps of oushions, ali sparkling with gold and silver. One large chandelier lit the scene, not brightly, but with a soft, subdued, mcon-like radiance that wa3 much more grateful to the senses. This light, too, left some more remote parta of the Hall in a kind of semi-obscurity, which had the effect of imparting to them a myatorious rich ness and beauty which a more perfect illumination would, no doubt, have gone far to dispel, if it had not entirely destroyed it On one of the ottomans sat the King. Ou another, near at hand, was the Tuikish Am bassador. There was a gloomy passage beyond ; it was gloomy on account of the semi-darknesa in which it was, but it waa richly carpeted and furnished with silken divan3 down the side a. At first Felix Heron was inclined to think that it was the Hall spoken of, but he was soon unde ceived. A door at tbe further extremity was opened, and he saw through it, aa the King and Lord Clackington passed on, before it was closed again, a scene of Oriental magnificence which perfectly astonished him. It waa but a transient glimpse that he had, but that glimpse left such an impression of lustrous beauty on his senses, tbat he longed to see more of it Lord Clackington was flitting about hither and thither, like some master of the ceremonies, who felt tbat npon his shoulders rested the success of the proceeding that he had inaugurated. Some half-dozen of tha youug girls belonging to the gipsy tribe were dancing before tho otto mans on which sat the King and the Turkish Am bassador. What should he do ? How was he now to act ? Should he boldly open the door, and, by virtue of his Oriental dreas, walk in ? Over their own squalid dresses, or ia lieu of them, they wore some tinsel-looking robes, which, although decidedly theatrical, yet harmonized well enough with tbe general character of the scene A couple of performers, one on a guitar and the other on a pair of caBtanets, made a vory melo dious jingle. Such was the stale of affairs in that place at the time of the entrance into it of, Felix Heron. It waa a great relief to him to find that no notice whatever waa taken of him. What wonld be said ? What would be done provided he were at once to be Been as an invited guest ? While these considerations were chasing each other through the mind of Felix Heron, voicea in laughter, and singing snatches of gay songs, came upon hia ears. A door opened, and a troop of young girls in brilliant fancy Turkish dresses came streaming The castanets jingled, and the guitar mingled its notes with the falling water ef the fountain for mor\u00bb than five minutes before any change took place in the posture of affairs, and then the Turkish Ambassador made an impatient gesture. The King nodded, and the dancers and the mu sicians at once hutried from the hall. in. , Accompanying them wera some two or three grave persona in Oriental robes, not much inferior to those worn by Felix Heron. Heron saw his enance at once, when all these persons bowed to him. He would pass into the beautiful hall beyond with them. Lord Claokington then advanced towards tha King, and bowed low. Aa the ancient hypecrite thus made his obei sance to the monarob, one of the Turkish attend ants eaid something to Heron, no donbt in good Turkish, whioh of course he did not comprehend a word of. They took him for one of the high and distin guished gnestg. The high and distinguished gnests might take him for one of them. The situation waa rather a trying one, for Heron was along with at least seven or eight of the at tendants of the Turkish Ambassador, and he could see that they were all well armed. In reply, he made an unintelligible sort of grunt, the meaning of which the man who had spoken to him seemed inclined to question, when the attention of all was called away by the Am bassador suddenly clapping his hands thrice. This seemed to be an understood signal, for the attendants hurried from the saloon. CHAPTER CVIl. FELIX HERON RESCUES THE INNOCENT, AND PER- FORMS A MiCHANIMOUa ACTION. Another moment. Time sufficient for a door to open and to shut Time for an embraMered curtain to be bald aside, and then to be 1 et fall again, so aa to ex clude the external air and all sound, and then Felix Heron was in that exquisitely luxurious and really beautiful ha 11, which had been adorned with Eastern magnifica nee. A fountain splashed up from a basin of marble in the centre of the floo r. The carpeting was in imitation of tropical Heron, however, remained. He had just time adroitly to hide himself be hind one of the pilea of oushions in the dimmest and most shadowy part of the hall. He was. then alone with the Ambassador, tha King, and Lord Clackington."], [287, "EDITH HERON. 281 as if he would fain there read what it waa that had so suddenly \"become strange. The King spoke again. \" Clackington, I oannot divest myself of the idea that we are in danger to-night\" \"Danger!\" The word evidently was the most uncomfort able one that Lord Claokington could hear. \"Danger!\" he repeated. \"I hope not I \u2014 I don't see it I\" The latter was still by the feet of the King, and as Heron was situated he heard what was said by them both. \" He will be asleep, yonr Majesty,\" said Clack ington, \"in another five minutes. The jewelled pipe he is now smoking has in the great glass bowl of it, which rests on that gold footstool, some powerful narcotising substance, whioh I have placed there.\" \"Good 1\" said the King. _ \" Perhaps, then, it will please yonr moat gra cious Majesty that the young girl, who ought only to be too proud of your Majesty's notice, should be introduced ?\" \" Are we alone, Clackington ?\" \"Quite so, your Majesty.\" \" Then \u2014 then But it is very strange \" The King paused in what he was sbout to say, and Lord Claokington looked into the royal eyes, \" It is, perhaps, only fancy. Are we quite alone with the exception of that \u2014 that half -sleepy old reprobate, the Ambassador?\" \" Quite \u2014 quite I He will soon be in the land of dreams, your Majesty, if there be any virtue in a good five grains of ornde opium.\" \" Then let her come.\" Lord Claokington bowed low, and crept out of the hall. No. 36\u2014 Edith."], [288, "EDITH HERON. 282 \" WiU your Majeaty, or shall I ?\" asked Clack ington, as he placed his handa on the lid of the basket. \" You\u2014 you !\" \" Very good !\" The lid was raised, and swung right over on one side, scattering tho flowers on to the floor in the greatest possible confusion. The King uttered an exclamation. Lord Clackington laughed. \" Did I not say that she was fair ?\" \" She transcends all description.\" _ _ The King stooped over the basket, and lifted in one hand a mass of beautiful hair, and then with the other he raise! a hand and an arm, both of which were richly adorned with jewels. Tha arm was partially covered with a drooping sleeve of pale pink satin. It was evident that the victim had bean adorned for the sacrifice. _ ' Felix Heron was aa full of curiosity at this point as he was of indignation. How or by what means the young girl who had been by force brought to that house waa to be conducted to the presence of the King, he could not imagine, for that she would come quietly and patiently with Lord Clackington waa scarcely to be believed. Bnt Heron had not to wait long for a solution of the mystery. A door waa opened at a part of the wall which concealed one, and two of tha gipsy women ap peared, carrying with them what looked like an immense bouquet of flowera. These flowera seemed as if they were heaped up in a basket, the handles of which the two gip sies held, and which they carried with the air aud manner of there beiug tome heavy weight within it. Without a Word, the basket with the bouquet was brought to the feet of the King. Lord Clackington then reappeared by the samo door at whieh he had left With low and respectful obeisances, the two women retreated from the hall. Again did Felix Heron bend his whole atten tion to the proceedinga of the monarch, and of the wretched old minister to his pleasures, Clacking ton. The gipsy women, if indeed they did belong iu (ruth to that singular people, bad dona their work, and had dressed the poor abducted girl in some rich and rare Eastern robes. Sho looked like some sultana in repose. \" She is lovely I\" said the King. \" You will now leave ua, Clackington.\" \" I go.\" \" But be within call.\" \" She is there,\" whispered Clackington. In the increased familiarity of guilt, the old courtier dropped much of hia common reapectful manner of speaking to the King. \" She \u2014 she is there, ther>?\" \" Yes, beneath the lid, which, only is covered with flowers.\" ., \" And\u2014 and\u2014 Clackington ?\" \" Yes.\" ' \" Certainly.\" Lord Clackington himself took a lingering look at tha young girl, aa though he were loth to leave her, and then he alowly retired. \"Lovely being,\" said the King, \"I will re store you to your senses; for now yon are, with all your beauty, rare and exquisite as it is, little better than a statue.\" He took the little phial from the ottoman. \" Yes, I will, by a drop of thia essence, bestow upon you, fair and beautiful creature that you are, a new life ; and I will hope that, weakened in perception by the fright and agitation you have gone through, and the narcotic that now steeps your senses in oblivion, you will, on awakening, forget the past, and be to me all that I wonld wish you\" Felix Heron crept nearer still. The King knelt by tho side of the capaoious basket in which the young girl was lying, and dropped Fomo of the essence from the phial on her lipa. With a faint sigh, she awoke. \"Mother!\" \" She sleeps ?\" \" She does. There is the small bottte of essence, one drop of which upon hor lipa will awaken her\" The King looked down npon the ottoman, and he saw that Lord Clackington had thoro placed a little bottle, about the size of those in which the world- renowned attar of roses is kept. \" It is well ! It is well ! But\u2014 but, Clacking ton?\" \" Yea.\" \" Is she so very fair ?\" \" Fair as the day !\" \" And \u2014 and \u2014 you say she ia a farmer's daughter ?\" \" To a certain extent, yes ; bnt the man is what is called a ' gentleman farmer,' and owns his own land. His name is Armstrong.\" \" I don't care to know his name. Let me see the girl?\" That was the first word she spoke. Ought it not to have reached the heart of the licentious man who was bending his keen glance npon her ? It ought, but it did not. Ha clasped his arms abont her as sho partially rose in the basket. Felix Heron crept slowly from behind the cushions, where he had been concealed. As he did so, he happened to take one glance at the Turkish Ambassador, and he saw tha jewelled mouthpiece of the pipe he was smoking slip from his hand, and the narcotised man fell over upon his Bide, where, for a few seconds, he was supported by the richly-embroidered pillows of the ottoman, and then he fell to the floor. Tho opium that Lord Clackington had mingled with the Turkish tobacco had done its terrible \" Beautiful girl, there shall not be a wish, h\u00bbw aver extravagant, that your imagination can dio tate, that ahall not be fulfilled. You shall revel in luxury and iu enjoyment You shall be a Queen, indeed, in all but the name ; aud what is there in a name? I, even I, will love you and your charma \" The young girl uttered a shriek of agony and aurprise. \" Nay, ba still ! Be still I\" \"Help! Oh, mercy! Where am I? What jaca is this? And who \u2014 oh, what fiend ia it j!,at whispers words cf poison in my ears ?\" tU\" Fiend?\" work. It was only, however, for a mere passing instant that Felix Heron troubled himself to look at the Ambassador, and then he again fixed all his regards upou the movements of tho King and of Lord Clackington. \" Yes ! Oh, yes ! Take your eyes away \u2014 they"], [289, "EDITH HERON. 283 burn with flume ! Father ! mother 1 brother ! oh, help mo now :\" \" Your cries are vain !\" eaid the King morosely, as he caught at the luxuriant locks of ber beautiful hair, and held her from moving out of the basket, as she had shown an inclination to do. \" Your cries are all in vain I This place, and all within hearing of it, owns me as its lord and its master. You have only so to own me, to make me from that moment your slave!\" \" Oh, heaven ! what does it all mean ?\" \" It means that I love you !\" \" But I do not love you ! It is my homo, and the dear friends that are there, whom I love !\" \" Yes. But my love ia worth a thonsand of such friends and such homea. Come, my dear girl ; your beauty waa not created by heaven to be lost amid the wilderness of the oountry. Be but gentle and kind to me, and I will raise you to such a height that you shall have the luxury of a power the Queen of England never could, '.or ona day, pretend to !\" \"No.no! I hate\u2014 I abhor you !\" \"Hate? Abhor?\" With a half-rush, he confronted the King and hia victim. \" Your prayer is answered ! I am here to save yon !\" The King staggered back until he fell over some of the cushions of tha ottoman. The youug girl felt that her deliverer had come, and, with a shriek of joy, she literally rushed into the arms of Heron, and sank upon his breast. \"Help!\u2014 help,, guards! What ho! Without there ! Help !\u2014 help !\" It was too late for Felix Heron to take any steps but the only one, which was that of taking his life, to stop these cries from the discomfited monarch. Violence of lhat description, of course, was out of the question ; and now that an alarm was fairly given, there was nothing for it but to adopt some bold course which, at all events, should have the effect of gaining time. That waa now the one important element iu the transaction which Hiroh had to look to as the means of saving not only himself, but the youug girl whom he had taken under his protec tion. Clasping hft left arm around her sl.ndar waist, he mada but one spring forward, and passed the King. Another instant, and Heron waa with the young girl at tho hack of the ottoman on which tha King half lay, half sat. \" Stir hand cr foot in an attempt to escape from this spot, and it is tho last moment of yosr life !\" \" Yes I There is wiokedness, fieudlike wicked ness, in your very look ! I hate you ; and I would rather die twenty deaths than be yours !\" \" You are mine !\" \" No \u2014 oh, heaven, no !\" \" I say you are. No one can save you now. When once suoh aa you are ia this place, hope is dead. \" I will not \u2014 I do not believe it ! Heaven does not desert those who to themselves are true.\" \" Try ! CaU for help \u2014 scream \u2014 shout \u2014 pray \u2014 yell \u2014 do what you will \u2014 say what you please \u2014 the result is still the same ! You are mine, and mine only !\" These terrible words seemed to strike like dag gers into the heart of the young girl From the position he occupied, Felix Heron could see that an universal trembling took posses sion of her limbs. She was unable to spoak. The triumph of the King seemed aa if it would be complete. \" If, on the other hand, you will not be a foe to yourself, and the worst enemy of your own hap piness, a brilliant and coveted career ia before you, ami you may be all that thousands would give half tho years of their lives to be I\" These expressions seemed to be more revolting to her than the others. She recovered her faculties with a cry of terror, and caUed out aloud, \" It may be that tho age of miracles has passed away, but I am sure that heaven cannot permit one of its creatures thus to perish!\" . , . Felix Heron now thought that the time for in terference had coma. Felix Heron uttered these words with a voice that rang through the haU, ancl which of them selves would have given a sufficient alarm to all in the villa, if the cries of tbe King had not already sufficed to do so. Aud not without some show of reason did Heron thus speak ; for from the breast of his apparel he produced a pistol, and held it to the head of the discomfited and fearfully alarmed King. Tha monarch just looked askance, and half up ward, sufficiently to see the weapon that waa levelled at his life. That one look was moro than enough. He cowered down on the ottoman, and, drawing up his legs, so as to reduce himself to the smallest possible compass, he cried out, in a voice that was a strange compound of rage and fear, \" In the name of the fiend, take yourself off, and the girl with you, since it must be so !\" \" Oh, let us fly ! My friend ! \u2014 my preserver ! Lot us fly !\" ' The young girl only saw that the present peril waa over ; but Felix Heron felt that to stir from tbe spot he occupied would be to court an amount of danger which, bold and daring as he was, ho felt it would not be possible for one single man to cope with. \" Patience, for a brief while,\" he whispered, \" and all will be well.\" CHAPTER CVIII. Then he spoke aloud, 5n reply to the King. \" No ! I have saved the victim, and I wUl take good care that the act shall not have the sequel yon would prepare for it !\" As Heron spoke, through various doors that led from the hall to other portions of the viUa, there came gipsies, attendants of the King and of the Ottoman Ambassador, together with some, no doubt, very confidential servants of my Lord Clackington, to the number of at least twenty persons. FEI1X HEKON AGAIN MAKES THE DISCOVERT THAT YOU SHOULD \"PUT NOT TOUR FAITH IN PRINCES.\" There was something intensely affecting about the manner iu whioh the young girl uttered those woids, which, while they were so full of despair, at the same time indicated a truthfulness that no thing could shake. Felix Heron could not have listened to another word had his own life depended npon it."], [290, "284 EDITH HERON. Had they been a hundred, Heron felt that, in the peculiar position he occupied, he was more than a match for them. He held the life of the King in his hands. Or, what was the same thing, so far as the fears of the monaroh were concerned, he seemed so to hold it that no nlterior steps shall be taken in this matter to stain your crown and dignity.\" \" None! none!\" \" And never again shall your myrmidons or those of Lord Clackington be permitted to trouble the peace of this yonng girl.\" \"Agreed Never! never!\" As Heron thus spoke to the King, one of the confidential servants of Lord Clackington crept slowly and stealthily round the royal ottoman until he got to the back of it, not far from Felix Heron. It was Lord Clackington who first found voice to cry out aloud, \" KU1 him ! Shoot him ! Make an end of him some way, any way, so that it be done speedily !\" The gipsies made a rush forward, with their knives in their hands. The young girl thought then that all was lost again, and she began to utter cries of terror. But Felix Heron was of quite a different opinion to that. The only parson who observed him was the beautiful yonng girl who had been resoued from a fate worse than death. \" Treachery I treachery I\" she cried, as she laid her hand on Heron's arm. And so was the King. \" Wretches !\" he cried. \" I suppose you wonld all see me murdered before your eyes 1\" They pansed in their onward movement. \" Back I baok 1\" added the King. \" Is it pos sible that yon, Clackington, do not see our dan ger ?\" Lord Claokington then did see it. He clasped his hands in despair. # \" Ah I is it so ?\" As Heron spoke, the man who had thought to turn the tide of affairs in another direction, rose to his feet, and with a shoot of exultation made a rush upon Heron with one of the splended Turkish scimitars in his grasp, which formed part of the costume of some of the Ambassador's attend ants. It might have at that moment fared iU with Heron, so far as some dangerous wound might have been the result but then came the sharp crack of a pistol-shot, and with a loud ory the man flung np his arms above his head, dropped the scimitar, and feU to the floor a corpse \" I think that will about do, Captain,\" cried a well-known voice. \"It is well!\" said Heron. \"I now perceive that yon, Lord Claokington, and your rascally myrmidons, are aware that you dare not advance another step !\" As he spoke, Heron pressed the barrel of the pistol against the neck of the King. \" Good graoions 1\" cried Clackington. \"The Lord have mercy upon me!\" ejaculated the King. He thought his last hour had oome. \" You do well,\" said Heron, \" to utter that prayer, for I will have no meroy upon you if any attempt be made to play treacherously with mel\" The doors of the hall were dashed open, and Tom Bipon, Ogle, and four of the band made an appearance, to the great discomfiture of Lord Claokington and the gipsies. A general rush took place to escape from tbe gorgeous apartment, and but that he feU down over the pipe- bowl of the Turkish Ambassador my Lord Clackington would likewise have es caped. As it was, he was captured by Tom Ripon, who, in a very inglorious manner, as far as his loraship was concerned, sat astride on his bask. Heron's men wonld doubtless have captured the whole of the gipsies, and their rascally associates, if he had so desired it ; but, as he gave no orders to that effect, they let them go. The fact was that Felix Heron was only too well pleased to get rid of them ; but he did not choose to part with the King quite so easily. Withont betraying the least alarm in his tones, or infusing into them even any extraordinary degree of interest, Heron stooped down and spoke to the King. \" It will, perhaps, not be quite safe for your Majesty to travel to London alone.\" \" To\u2014 to London ?\" The King moved a little on the ottoman, and looked up uneasily in the face of Heron. \"Who are you?\" Heron had on his half-vizor, and the quiet, dark coloured dress he had on presented no peculiarity that could lead to a knowledge of who he was. \"Yes !\" cried Lord Clackington ; \"in the name of the d Well, well ! in the name of who and what you like, who are you, and what* do you want here ?\" \" It is your master that I will reply to,\" said Heron, \" and not to you, base slave and minion of one greater than yourseU, and yet less than the least\" \" Less than the least?\" muttered the King. \" Yes,\" added Heron, \" if the least be honest, and have any shame or virtue.\" \" Bring him down with a .long shot,\" growled one of the attendants. \" Ah ! say you so.\" Heron laid his left hand upon the shoulder of the King. \"No! no!\" yeUed the monarch. \"Whoever says that is a traitor. No ! ne ! No long shots or short shots here. We are in danger !\" \" Name your reward,\" said Lord Clackington, \" and yonr audacity shall command it. Name your reward, and release this gentleman.\" \" I have named it to myself, and I will name it to him,\" replied Heron, \" and as I happen to know who this gentleman is \" \" You will keep the knowledge to yourself,\" eaid the King, and be decent Heron stooped towards his ear and spoke low, \" Yonr Majesty will promiss, on your honour, \" Yes. I feel it my dnty, aa I know it is my pleasure, to escort you to St. James's.\" \" But\u2014 but\u2014 the\u2014 the girl?\" \" Ah, yes ; that is well thought of. I am quite confident that your Majesty's presence here may be accounted for in a manner that might be creditable.\" \"Eh?\" \" Suppose now, for one moment, that your Ma jesty, auspecting that the Ottoman Ambassador kept this villa a little way out of town, to com pensate him for the loss of a seraglio at Constanti nople \u2014 and suppose that in yonr Majesty's provi dent care for the honour of the meanest peasant girl in yonr dominions, yon had been iesol7ed to break np snoh a combination ?\""], [291, "EDITH HERON. 285 \" We\u2014 we\u2014 that is \" position on the floor, and, alighting on hi8 shonlders, sent the ancient piece of iniquity slat to the floor. \"Oh, it is all a lie!\" \" A what ?\" \"All a romance. Your Majesty had no such notions or ideas, but in reality suffered yourself to be led into participating \" \"Hush!\u2014 huBhl\" \" Murder ! \u2014 murder !\" \" Oh, you are not dead yet 1\" said Tom. \" Ogle,\" said Heron, \" take my Lord Claoking ton, and accommodate him with a bath on the common.\" In the very transactions I have made mention of. Yon know that is the truth.\" \" A bath ?\" said the King. \u2022 \" Yes, there is a mud ditch in which his lord ship can remain as long as he thinks proper-\" When did such a man as Lord Clackington re ceive the least spark of consideration from the employers who made use of the services of such an one, at the same time that he despised the base tool of bis own evil passions? _ The King smiled as he heard what fate was des tined for Lord Clackington. With howls of fear, and imprecations, and prayers for mercy, Clackington was led forth. At the same time, in obedience to a whispered injunction from Felix Heron, the King ordered his carriage. It was, in truth, a strange sight to Bee the Ma jesty of England in such a predicament. Heron took good care to keep the King's arm fast within hia own, so that it was not probable that any of the gipsies, or of the attendants of the Ottoman Ambassador, would venture upon any act of violence which might attack the wrong object Tae whole of those men, however, who made np the Oriental-looking attendants of the villa, had disappeared. Not a sonnd waa heard ; and nothing was te be seen now but Captain Heron, the King, the young girl who had been rescued, and Heron's own men. \" I \u2014 me ? I think I comprehend you !\" \" Indeed !\" \" Yes. You suggest that snch a construction as wonld save my name might be pnt npon the affair ?\" \" I do \u2014 for certain considerations !\" M Ah! now I know how to deal with you.\" \"Not quite I\" u Do you want to be paid ?\" \" Ay ; but not, perhaps, in the coin yonr Ma jesty thinks I\" \" What coin, then ?\" \" In the first placs, give me your kingly word that, by accompanying you to London, 1 \u2014 let me be who I may \u2014 shall incur no risk whatever?\" \"Idol\" \" Then I will go with you ; bnt I insist, or I suggest tbat this young girl be taken to her home in safety in your Majesty's carriage. It wiU look well!\" The King groaned. \"You consent?\" \" I do \u2014 I do 1 Will you now tell me who and what yon are, for yon are no common man, and I at times fanoy that the sound of yonr voice is not altogether quite unfamiliar to me.\" Captain Heron had striven as mnch as he could to alter his voice, so that he should not be all at once recognised as that Earl of Whitcombe who had certainly received from the Court of St. James's but scant justice. \" It matters not now,\" he Baid, \" who or what I am.\" The King's coach, however, was at the garden gate of the villa. Strange to say, however, there was no coachman to be seen nor other servant \" Well, then, I am ready,\" said the King. The royal anxiety to change the scene, and get rid of a set of circumstances that were anything bnt gratifying, was evidently very great. But Heron felt that the danger was not all over. He stepped down from behind the ottoman, and took the King's arm, which he placed beneath his own. CHAPTER C1X. THE FORTUNES OF CAPTAIN HERON HANG UPON THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT.\u2014 A VIBIT TO LON- DON. \" Quick, Ogle, with my Lord Clackington !\" cried Heron. In abont two minutes more a loud scream awakened the echoes far and near. \" I have to ask your Majesty's pardon for this familiarity,\" he said, \" but some exceedingly in discreet person among those who came down here with my Lord Clackington may take a long shot at me.\" . That scream was commingled with a splash, as of some heavy body finding a place in water. And such was, in truth, the fact ; for Lord Clack ington was in the middle of a green and muddy pond on the common. The King smiled again. Heron saw the smile. \" What sort of faith,\" he thought to himself, \" can I put in this man, who is so indifferent to what beoomes of those creatures who pander to his pleasures ?\" Heron had made np his mind what to do. He would aocompany the Kiug to London, and there he would make a last effort to awaken the com mon sentiments of justice and humanity in the heart of the monarch. \"A shot?\" \" Yes, your Majesty.\" \" But in that case they might hit ourselves.\" \" That is just exactly my opinion.\" \"Stop\u2014 stop I I command every one to be peaceable and quiet I go with this \u2014 this \" \" Gentleman,\" said Heron. \" Yes ; this gentleman, of my own free-will and consent\" \" I think that will do,\" said Heron. \" Yes, yes; that will surely do. Come, my Lord Clackington, we will go at once to London.\" \" No, said Heron. \" We will go\u2014 that is to say, I and your Majesty ; but I cannot condescend to have such a man as Lord Clackington for a travelling companion. My men will see to him.\" \" Oh, yes I\" said Tom Ripon. As Tom spoke he made another flying leap at Lord Clackington, whom he had only a few mo ments before released from his most humiliating It will be recollected that the first and most im portant act of treachery, in connexion with the Court that Heron had to complain of, consisted in the refusal to grant the free pardon to his Land, that had been solemnly promised."], [292, "286 J.DITH HERON. It was that act which had really first determined. Heron to place himself, despite hia peerage, in op position to the Court From it might be said to have issued all the subsequent events. At all risks, Heron waa re solved that he would not retire into the security of Mb new position, and leave tha law to pour forth the vials of its wrath upon that faithful band, which, through so many dangers, had been true to him. n And now ha meant to let the King know what he really thought of such an act, and to put it to him to take some steps that should alter the posi tion of affaire. The King sat back in the carriage, and stro VJ to hide hia face from all observation. Not all his rank \u2014 not all his power, and not all his wealth, and all the well-paid audacity of the myrmidons who waited upon him, had been suffi cient to induoa tbat young girl to greet him, for one half moment,' as she bad spontaneously greeted Felix Heron. The royal mortification may be supposed to have been great. \"Now, your Majesty,\" said Heron, when they wore alone, \u2014 \" now for St. James's I\" u n0 i\u00bb \" No ? Where, then, would you wish to go ?\" \" To Warwick House, if you happen to know it\" \" I do. It ia one of the royal residences, aud it matters not to mo whioh one I conduct your Majesty to. \" And what waa it that now induced Heron onoa more to wish to be acknowledged as the Earl of Whitcombe ? The reader can guess. In the depths of the umbrageous recesses of Epping Forest there now lived and thrived the heir to the title and the estates of tha earldom. \" Be it Warwick House, then ; aud, whan there, you can name you wishes. Till I am beneath a rocs that calls me its mautcr, I will say no more!\" His son ! Edith's son ! Could he make up his mind to let so fair a title and such fine properties pass away from the being who was now tho dearest object the earth could ever contain for him ? Heron waa content onous_;h that the King should adopt, this resolution, and ha did not interrupt the royal cogitations. The coach was skilfully enough driven by the young gipsy boy, Zad, and Ogle occupied a placa behind. Ah, no! Tha King stepped into the carriage. Felix Heron handed iu tha young girl, who now looked so radiantly beautiful, that if any possible excuse could have bean found for the outrage that had beeu perpetrated by forcing her from ber home, it could only be the shear intoxication of her charms that could be pleaded. \" Ogle, you will drivel\" said Heron. But as he spoke, the gipsy-boy Zad darted for ward, and laid his hand (upon the arm of Heron. Ho looked up into his face most imploringly, as he eaid, \" f am more than suspected by my people.\" \"Indeed!\" The rest of the band, including Tom Ripon, had been ordered back to the forest. Ogle was in a state of trepidation. Ho thought that Heron ventured a great deal too much. He had heard, from what had been said, who it waa that occupied the coach along with hia Oaptain. But Ogle did not put faith in kings. That some treachery would be the result of the trustfulness of Felix Heron, he was terribly afraid. Ogle was right. But we will not anticipate events. The coaoh made its way into the Park, and soon the duU portal of old Warwick House was reached. \"Yes. They will kill me; so you will let me go with you ?\" \" Assuredly !\" The light of joy shone in the eyes of Zad. \" I can drive this carriage for you, O master !\" he said. \" Let your mau get up behind. He wiU see, then, that all ia ease.\" That house was a royal, and, at the same time, a private residence. It was to it tbat tho King was in the habit of retiring when he wanted a little peaoe and quiet ness, and freedom from the state and ceremony of his position. I.t was quite an understood thing that when the King was at Warwick House he was out of town \u2014 not at home \u2014 and not accessible to any business whatever. \" Be it so. You hear, Ogle ?\" \" Yes, Captain.\" Ruch, then, waa the mode in which the King of England was conducted from Osmanli Villa. The route across the common to the farm house, whioh was the home of the young girl, was first of all taken. She was safely conducted to the gate of a pretty garden, and there she alighted. \"I shall call aad see you,\" said Heron; \"bnt in tbe meantime you are, I think, perfectly safe. If, however, anything should happen to make you ever think otherwise, come yourself, or send some one on whom you could rely, to Epping Forest, and let them imitate, while there, the hooting of an owl \" Probably, it waa on this account \u2014 namely, tho quiet and the privacy of the houae \u2014 that iuduced tbe King to select it as that to which he would rather, under the present circumstances, be con veyed. The carriage waa, of course, at once recog nised. The portal opened, and the horses trotted into the court-yard. Tha attendants upon royalty at Warwick Hous . were much too well-bred to express or even ic look the least suspicious about anything what ever. \" Yes\u2014 oh, yea ! Oh ! how can I thank you enough ?\" Tho young girl, tvbo had with such a con stancy of purpose resisted all the blandishments cf the KiDg, threw her arms round tbe neck of Heron, aud left a soft and gentle kiss upon his cheek. i When, therefore, they s .w the King's private carriage drawtf by a gipsy boy, aud a man behind it tlressed in anything but the royal livery, they looked as if everything was just as usual. Felix Heron alighted first He held the door of the carriage open for the King. The action was so innocent, so childlike, and so engainng, that it greatly affected Heron. \" Woe \u2014 woe,\" he said, \" be to him who will henceforth take the hazard of interfering with the innocent and even tenour of -jo'ix life !\""], [293, "EDITH HERON. 287 There wa3 no trouble\u2014 there were no guards nil was repose and serenity. A couple of attendants in black\u2014 for the royal family waa at that time in mourning for the Princess Anne of the Netherlands\u2014 stood by the carriage, and bowed low aa the King passed them, leaning on the arm of Felix Heron. The fact was, that the royal curiosity to kn who Heron was had become intense. That he was no common highwayman or free booter tho King could easily imagine. He had seen too much good society not lo be able to per ceive that the manner and tha tone of his captor were those of a gentleman. What was the name of that, gentleman, however, was now a wish of the royal heart to know, that almost overcame the mortification of the defeat of the night's projects. It was the King who then spoke to Heron. \" Well, sir \u2014 who and What are you ?\" \" A man, and a peer of England.\" \" Ah !\" The King atarted to his feet. \" la this possible ?\u2014 one of our peers ! Nr., no ! \u2014 it cannot be. No one would venture thus to cross us \u2014 no one would dare !\" \" Perhaps but one !\" _ And who \u2014 who is that audacious one ? Speak, sir ; or \u2014 or, rather, let me name you \u2014 which I shall, no doubt, if what you say be true' \u2014 on yonr removal of that half-mask that shrouds your face.\" Heron slipped off the mask. The King uttered an exclamation. \" Your Majesty knows me ?\" \" I do. The highwayman who pretended to be the Earl of Whitcombe. We do indeed know yon!\" \" This way !\" said the King. \" I am at your Majesty's disjftsal,\" replied Heron. \" You are !\" The tone in which those two short words were uttered brought with it a slight suspicion to tho mind of Heron. CHAPTER Oi\". CAPTAIN HERON EFFECTS AN ESCAPE TO CASTLE- NEAU HOUSE, AND FOILS LORD CLACKINGTON. He spoke agaiD. \" I am at the same time in the hands of the King's honour, and enter this houae on the assur ance of hia plighted word.\" \" You are quite safe, sir.\" \" I am sure of that !\" \"No!\" said Heron. \" Ye8 ; a thousand times, yes ! We have that attribute of royalty never to forget a face once seen.\" \" The Rose Cabinet !\" eaid the King, in rather a sharp tone. Another attendant, with a white wand in his hand, the topmost portion of which was gilt about a couple of feet in depth, now preceded the King and Heron. \" Your Majesty ia right aa regards the face,\" said Heron, \" but wrong as regards the deception.\" \" Ah !\" \" Yes. I am not the highwayman who pre tended to be the Earl of Whitcombe, but I am the Earl of Whitcombe who waa once a highwayman.\" \" But who will be neither Earl of Whitcombe nor highwayman for long, since the strong arm of the law must \" Along a hall lined with fair statues. Up a short staircase richly adorned with tapestry. Along a short passage, and then for the whole length of a suite of rooms of great magnificence, went the attendant with the white wand. The King laid his hand on the silken tassel of a bell-pull. \" Hold !\" cried Heron. \" Is your royal memory so short that you forget the word of honour under the safeguard of which I came hither ?\" The King dropped the beU-pull. \" Ah, yes ! I see that your Majesty has at least the one attribute without which royalty wonld indeed be a sham anda fares \u2014 the sense of honour.\" Then a door of carved oak was flung open. The man with the wand stood aside, and bowed low. The King crossed the threahold. Felix Heron soUowed. The door was closed, and Heron, at an hour of the night when it may be SEfpposed four-fifths of the population were asleep, found himself in the warm and pleasant atmosphere of that room in Warwick House alone with tho King. The room was caUed the Roae Cabinet, in con sequence of those flowers being exquisitely carved in high relief in the compartments of the ceiling. A fire of cedar wood, with just sufficient sea-coal to make it burn briskly, was in the grate, or rather on the hearth \u2014 for grate, properly so called, as the word is understood now, there was none. The King flung himself into a chair with a groan. \" What do you want?\" cried the King, in a pas sionate tone. \" What do you require ? What is the object of all this ? Are you not satisfied that you have, in the most obstrusive manner, annoyed and forced yourself upon our presence this night.\" \" No, I am not satisfied!\" \"What is if, then?\" \" I am the Earl of Whitcombe ! Your Majesty must ba fully aware that I have a right to the title!\" \" I am aware of no such thing ! Your right is disputed by the Lord Warringdale, who says that you are illegitimate, and that it waa only out of an extravagant and overweening fondness for you, just because of the lawless life you led, that the late Earl was induced to give ns and our Privy CouncU false evidence on your behalf ; and, moreover, we have had a petition of right pre sented by another person, who claims the whole titles and estates as the representative of the younger branch of the family.\" \"Indeed!\" Heron did not wish to fail in any usual respect that might be proper to the kingly office, whatever was hia own opinion of the individual who held it, and he remained standing. But he had taken np a position far in the room, close to the fire-place, so that he could see the King weU, and speak to him freely. A chandelier dependent from the centre ef the ceiling lighted the room but indifferently with its twelve wax-lights. , But still the light, although not bright, waa soft and pleasant.

Upon trying the door of that last room, which, if open, would have conducted him to the narrow passage, he fonnd it locker}- Heron turned instantly with the intention of re tracing his steps to tho Rose Cabinet But such a course was out of his power now. The door immediately behind him, and through which be had'just passed without interruption, was locked on the other side. Felix Heron was not in a prison, but he was a prisoner, notwithstanding. A feeling of sickening apprehension came across his heart It wa3 not for himself he felt it, but for his Edith. \" A fair trill by my peers 1\" \" Absurd !\" \" And your royal word that those companions of my fortunes who followed me whUe I was in security shall receive a free pardon!\" \" It cannot be I\" Again he tried both the doors, and finding that no accidental slicking of the locks or error in his handling them held them fast, but that in reality they were fast, he bitterly blamed the false confi dence that had brought him to the Palace. Suddenly, then, some one knocked sharply at one of the doors. \"Then I bid your Majesty good night; and since I may not be a peer in St. James's, I can still be a king on the road and in the forest ! Yet stay \u2014 I will say this much ! I will abide by any charges made agaiust mo, and defy the proof in any way you please, if you will now sign the pardon of all whom I chooie to name who have acted under my orders iu Epping Forest I\" \"Never! A band of robbera 1\" \" Who knocks?\" asked Heron. \"Ha! ha I \"laughed a voice, which he recog nised as that of Lord Clackington. \" Ha ! ha ! Is the bird caged?\" Heron would not reply. \"Ha! ha! He snlks, does he? But it don't matter much. I have the honour to atate that I have sent for the constables to remove the house breaker and highwayman to his proper place \u2014 Newgate!\" Still Heron would not speak. He heard Lord Clackington, on the outer side of the door, chuckling and laughing, and then he heard him Bay, in a voice of authority, \" You wiU keep strict guard, not stirring from your post till the officers of the law arrive.\" \" Then onca more good night ! And yet \" \" Yet y ou linger ! \" \"I do linger! I have loat all ambition to be the sort of thing of which I have seen specimens at your Court ; but it may be that in the course of time a purer atmosphere may ba found in St James's, and then it will be a something to be a peer of England I\" \" Indeed 1\" \" Yes. And for that reason I will yet make another proposition.\" \" You are too modest, sir, by half II said the King, sneeringly. \" Pray what is the other propo sition?\" \" Yes, my lord,\" said a voice in reply. \" Ah ! Here they come \u2014 here they come ! straight from the Round-house of St. James's! Now we have him!\" \" It is this. I assume that there are great personal objections to me which will not apply to another, who, without my antecedents, may justly lay claim to the title and estates of Whitcombe.\" \"WeU?\" Captain Heron was not idle while this wa3 going on ontaide the door. There was no time to resort to any, measures to open the other door, and after one vigorous effort that he had made at its p\u00bbnels, he had felt satisfied that it was by far too stout and strong to be broken down. \" I am personally, then, content to renounce them wholly and entirely, on condition that my son and heir be legally installed in all the dignities of a peer.\" \" Now, by my faith, you are too modest aa I have said \u2014 too modest by far ! The sou and heir of a vagabond \u2014 of a highwayman!\" There was but one resource- The apartment had two windows, that both looked into the garden of old Warwick House. If there were any cbauc-s ef escape for Felix Heron, they were to be looked for in relation to those windows. \" Beware!\" \" You threaten ?\" \" No ; but I say beware ! There is a point beyond whioh I will not allow even the King of England to go in speaking of me and of mine. The King made an impatient gesture. \" Go, sir I\" he said \u2014 \" go while yet you may. I have nothing further to say to such as yon.\" \" Be it so. I want, then, a free pass from your Majesty.\" \" You have it by the mere fact that I do not in terfere to stop yon. No one wiU question you as But how remote such chances might be, or what difficulties might be in his way, Heron had no means at that present moment of know ing. There was, however, one movement that it was still in his power to make, which gave him time, and, to a certain extent, baffled his mes. The locks of the doors were of that old, mat-"], [295, "EDITH HERON. 289 five, rich brass lacquered description, which are to be found in the residences of royalty aud no- bUity of abaut that period. At the lower portion of those locks was a strong, solid, stiding bolt, that, although small in dimensions, was > et rather a formidable obstacle when ahot into its place. Heron did not overlook this little advantage. It waa true that by the devicea, no doubt, of Lord Clackington he was shut into that room, bnt it waa equally true that he possessed the means of shutting his enemies out of it At the instant, then, that a hand waa placed upon the lock of one of the doors from without, Felix Heron seoured it from within. A hard push waa given to it. \" Fast !\" cried tbe voice again. \" He has se cured himself within, my Lord Clackington!\" \" Confusion seize him !\" These last words were in the tones of Lord Clackington himself. But Felix Heron felt tbat if he were to derive any advantage from this state of affairs, it muat ba immediate. He flew to the window that was the nearest to him. Into the night air he looked forth. He saw some moving object a short distance from him, and a second look let him see what it reaUy was. The topmost branohea of a tree. He waa all that height, then, from the gronnd, so that a leap or a drop from the window was out of the question. The tree, too, was by far too distant to be available as a means of escape. \"Surrender! \u2014 surrender!\" cried a voice; \"or take the consequences I Ah!\" The disappointment at not finding the door open with the facility that waa anticipated was evidently great No. 87. \u2014 Edith."], [296, "290 EDITH HERON. The monk disappeared through the opening, as he said again, \"FoUow! \u2014 follow quickly, or you are too late I\" \" Foroe the door!\" oried a voice from without \" Force the door ! I will be a sufficient warrant for suoh an act 1\" \" Be it so, then.\" said Heron to himself, as he drew one of his pistols. \" I will not be caught in this manner, like a rat in a trap. Let him who will face me take the consequences of hia own act!\" The truth of this statement waa apparent enough, and Felix Heron glided after him like his shadow. The mirror waa restored to its place by a touch. The only sound it made wa3 a slight snapping one, as some lock or spring secured it, and then aU waa still on that side. There was, however, anything but stillness in the room. As Heron spoke, ha heard some effort being made to force the lock of one of the doors, but concurrent with that sound a strange flash of light came suddenly across his eyea. It waa tbat kind of flash which goes by the popular name of \" Jaok-a-dandy,\" and which can only be produced by a reflection from a mirror, or some bright reflecting substance. Where could it come from iu that place and at such an hour ? \" Seize him ! \u2014 saize him ! and, on the least re sistance, cut him down!\" cried Lord Clacking ton. There was a rush of feet into the room, and than an expression of blank dismay, as its empty condition was discovered. Felix Heron turned round rapidly to notice the cause of the effect \" Perdition seize tha fellow!\" cried Claokington. \" Where can he be hidden?\" His surprise was great to see a figure standing a few paces from him in the room. The figure exactly resembled a monk of the olden times. The monk touohed the arm of Heron, and in the lowest possible whisper said, \"Follow! fol low!\" A grey habit clothed it from head to foot, and the cowl was drawn over the head so far aa to leave only exactly the oval of the face from the eyes to the chin, and a little space on each side, dimly visible. In its right hand the figure held a light \u2014 a smaU hand-lamp, fed with oil, and burning dimly \u2014 which it elevated above its head, aa high as it could reach. \" I will ! I will touch your robe so that you will know I am close to you.\" \" Do so ! Do so !\" Captain Heron folt consoious thai he was with his mysterious conductor in one of thoae narrow passages constructed in the wall, which are to be found in some old houses, and which were so com monly contained in mansions built at or about the time of the Reformation by the Catholic nobles, who wished to conceal the agents of Rome in their dwellings. The touch of the monk's robe was quite sufficient to convince Heron that it was a being of flesh and blood that he had to deal with. The left hand waa concealed in the folda of the monk'a robe. Perhaps it held some weapon. The flash of Ught tbat had come across the eyes of Heron waa now sufficiently explained. Immediately behind this seeming apparition of a monk was a tall mirror, let into the wall of the room between two windows, and it waa the re flection of the lamp in that polished surface tbat had made the flash. After following, then, hia mysterious conductor some twenty paces, the latter stopped . \" Reply to me frankly,\" he said. \" I will do so.\" \" Your name ?\" For a few seconds Heron regarded this appear ance with silent surprise. Whether it was a reality, or something conjured up by imagination, he could not decide. But the monk dispelled all such illusion by speaking. \" Who and what are you ?\" he said. \" Speak, and say what have you done, that you are sought Uke one who stands at bay in hazard of his life ?\" \" I may well,\" said Heron, \" reply to those ques tions by another. \" What other ?\" \" I am known by several.\" \" AU of them, then.\" \" I should call myself Earl of Whitcombe \" \" Ah !\" \" But there are those who name me Falix Heron, and some call me Captain Heron.\" \"Is it possible?\" \" Is what possible ?\" \" That you are the celebrated Captain Heron of Epping Forest, who the world says made an auda cious grasp at the coronet of a peer, and only missed retaining it by a miraole.\" \"No! I made no audacious grasp at a peer age!\" \" I might ask if yon be of this world, or some being permitted to revisit it from another ?\" The monk made an impatient gesture. \" Yon do not speak your mind,\" he said ; \" but I will save you, withont knowing who or what you are, because I can perceive, at all events, one thing \" \" And that ?\" inquired Heron. \" That is, that your enemies are my enemies !\" A sudden crash at the door signified that it was on the point of being forced. \" Will you trust me ?\" whispered the monk. \u00ab I will !\" \"Did you not?\" \" Certainly not ! Tha peerage was my own. 1 am the legitimate son of the late Earl of Whit combe, and, therefore, the true heir to that title and all that appertains to it\" \" Who, then, is the Lerd Warringdale ?\" \" My brother \u2014 my illegitimate brother.\" \" Well, it may be so. Come on.\" \"Whither?\" \" Let it suffice that I say come on. You can re ceive it as an order.\" \"Follow, then!\" The monk hurried abruptly towards the long mirror that was set into the wall by the two win dows, and touching a portion of the framework, the mirror immediately turned upon its centre. A dark and gloomy-looking aperture waa dis- \" Then I will not come on !\" \" Are you mad ?\" \" No ! But the man who thinks he can make me come on by suoh language to me may be con sidered mad I\" \" Very well. I request that you will foUow dosed beyond. me.\""], [297, "EDITH HERON. 291 \" I follow, then.\" Abont twenty more paces were traversed in tbat gloomy passage, and then the monk, pausing, spoke again. \" Do not be surprised.\" \" I am not easily so.\" There was a flash of light again, and Felix Heron heard a confused murmur of voices. Another revolving mirror opened into a room in which there were abont six persons, and on a table in the centre of it were several emaU hand lamps, similar to that which he who may be caUed Captain Heron's monk carried. \" Peace and faith,\" said the monk. \" Peace and faith,\" repeated every one. It was quite clear that those words were a sori of pass by which these persons recognised each other. It were almost better to be in the hands of the law than in those of men who would feel that he muat either help or mar their projects, and who would not Bcruplo to ensure, by death, his secrecy, if it were necessary. The conference did not last many minutes. Then the whole party advanced towards him, and one lifted a chair by the back, as he said, courteously, \" Be seated here, Captain Heron.\" \" Thank you, no.\" \" Nay, I particulars wish it\" \" And I decline.\" Heron thought his situation a great deal safer with his hack to the mirror. \" We have it in our power to enforce com pliance, sir,\" said another, in angry tones. \" No,\" replied Hei on, \" you have not.\" \" We are seven to one.\" \" Which one will die, then,\" said Heron, \" to enable the other six to achieve such a barren triumph ?\" As he spoke, he drew a pistol, and held it care lessly in his left hand. It was rather amusing to Heron to see the ala crity with which he who had spoken so angrUy re treated, and pnt some oi his friends between him self and Heron. At the first moment, those who were in that room assembled did not see Felix Heron. They were all attired Uke his conductor in monk's robes, and the moment they did see him exclamations burst forth from every lip, and the robes were dashed sufficiently on one side to enable each man to lay his hand upon his sword. Then Heron saw that , beneath those monk's dresses they wore ordinary clothes, and that, whUe some were in half or undress mUitary uniforms, others were in the costume worn at Court. \"Come, come !\" said the monk who had been named Marquis, and who had brought Heron to the loom, \u2014 \u2022\u2022 come, come ! this kind of wrangling is as useless as it is dangerous ! Oaptain Heron, we have a proposition to make to you.\" \" I listen, sir.\" \" You shall not only be assured of your earl dom, which shaU never again ho questioned, but a dukedom shall be at your disposal.\" Heron smiled. \" My earldom, gentlemen, I have. I am the Earl of Whitcombe, aud no power can take it from me ; but, admitting that you had it in yonr power to do me some favour, pray let me ask what is to ba the consideration ?\" CHAPTER CXI. CAPTAIN HERON ESCAPES FROM WARWICK HOUSE, AND MERT8 WITH AN ADVENTURE BEFORE DAT LIGHT. At this hostile reception Felix Heron stepped back a pace That pace brought him with his back close to the mirror, so that no one could attack him in that direction. \"Oh, simple!\" \"What is it?\" \" Gentlemen,\" he eaid, \" I do not come here with any design to intrude upon you or your secret councils, but I mean to defend my Ufa.\" \" Hush ! Let me speak,\" eaid the mysterious conductor ef Felix Heron. \"Join us!\" \" In what ?\" \" In restoring the throne of these realms to the proper family, the Stuarts, who are the rightful heirs to the Crown, and in restoring the ancient religion.\" \"Heaven forbid,\" said Heron, \"that I should say one word against the religion that any one in his heart and conscience professes, and which is the faith of many of the bravest, the most gene rous and best of men, but I will join in no plot.\" \" It is too late to say no.\" \" Indeed 1\" \" Is be one ?\" cried aU the others with one voice, and stiU keeping their hands upon their swords. \" Not yet, but \" \" Oh, Marquis, Marquis, how indiscreet !\" By this stray remark Felix Heron found that the seeming monk who had introduced him to that strange assemblage was a man of rank. \" Not so,\" was the reply, \u2014 \" not so, my lord. I only humbly accept the good that Providence sends ns. Yon do not know this man.\" \" Yes, Captain Heron ; you are here, and you have eeen some of us, and you may know those you have seen ; and, in fact, it is now a moral necessity that yon should be with us, or \" \" Or what, sir ?\" \"Yon can guess.\" \" I wUl not attempt to stultify either you or myself, gentlemen, as to deny that I understand those words in any other sense than as a threat of assassination.\" \" What good ? What good ?\" said several at once. \" A stranger \u2014 perhaps a spy 1\" \"No! This is the celebrated Captain Felix Heron of Epping Forest!\" \" Ah ! The claimant of the Whitcombe peer age?\" \" The same. Let me speak to you aside, gen tlemen all. Captatn Heron, pray excuse us for a moment !\" The group of personages in the monks' robe3 removed a few paces from Heron, and conversed in whispers- He began to think his position anything but a pleasant one. A suspicion that these men of rank were en gaged in some conspiracy against the Government nd King grew into strength each moment \" Death !\" \" Death ! death !\" The word was repeated with an affeoted solemn intonation by them all. A faint smile flickered over the handsome face of Felix Heron. \" Gentlemen, I have faced death too often to ba taken with fright at the name.\""], [298, "292 EDITH HERON. proceeding almoat of a character approaching the magical. They were stunned as if each one had received some severe blow, which, for the moment, had incapacitated them for action. FeUx Heron was not the sort of man to lose any such advantage as that. He did not linger an instant on the other side of tho mirror, but taking the same course that the sham monk bad conducted him, he was soon somewhere about the spot where the other mirror was situated. A faint pencil of light came through a orevice. It was eo faint that it scarcely sufficed to alter the dark oharacter of the air about it, but yet it was sufficient to induce Heron to think that he had reached the room from which he had made his escape bo recently- / \" Then let the name precede the actual thing Itself I\" cried one Suddenly drawing tbe sword, on which this man, who was tall and stout, had kept his hand -luring the whole of the little conference, he made a rush at Felix Heron. The moment was indeed critical. While he had held the pistol in hia left hand, Heron had, with his right amid the aomi-darknesa of the room, felt carefully along the gilt frame of the mirror to find the spring by which it could be opened. He had found it. A small portion of the framework had given a little to pressure. As when Heron removed or relaxed the pres sure he found that the portion of the frame rose up again to its ordinary level, he felt convinced that he bad hit upon the spring. Now Felix Heron was in one difficulty. He knew perfeotly well that the pistol he held rather ostentatiously in his left hand was not loaded. Carefully he felt the wall. His hand touched something cold. It was some slight projection of metal. A pressure had no effect upon it, but a latera'. movement had at once. That was the secret The mirror waa there, and it slowly opened. As it did so, it caught in something on the floor of the narrow passage. Heron looked down ; the something was a monk's robe, similar to that worn by the conspirators. \" This,\" said Heron, \"may serve me better than sword cr pistol.\" Another moment, and he had put on the robe and drawn the cowl over his face partially. Then Heron stepped out into the room. Ono of the doors was open. It was that door the latch of which had been forced in the search for him, and there were no means now of fasten ing it. A soft light came in from the passage beyond. \"Now, heaven aid me I\" said Heron. \"If once more I hear the sighing of the brpeze in the old trees of Epping Fore.t, it shall not be a trifle that shall again tempt me beneath the roof of a r^yal residence.\" He was crossing tbe room, when the door was pushed further open, and a gentleman in a Court dresa approached. At sight of Heron ha started baok, but instantly recovered himself, and advancing a pace or two, he said, \" Peace I\" It was an act of carelessness, but tha fact waa that the pistol he had discharged npon thecommon, to the terror of thc driver of the carriage that waa going to OsmanU Villa, waa the only one he had charged. An empty pistol had terrified the King. An empty one now was all he had to oppose to this man who rushed on him in so violent a manner, sword in hand. But little did the infuriated conspirator know of the cool courage and tho fertility of resources of the man he encountered. Heron dodged the thrust that waa aimed at him, and moved aside two steps. He was in reach of the monk who had con ducted him to that room of danger. The robe of the sham monk ' had been suffered to fall aside, and Heron's eyes had rested on the hilt of a sword, which seemed to be at once costly and effioient With that ease and precision that accomplishes so much, combined with the courage of the moment, that knows no fright or trepidation, Heron tore from its sheath his sword, and crossed blades with his assailant. Po adroitly was this done, that it seemed aa if a weapon bad descended from the ceiling into the hands of FeUx Heron. Heron recollected that that waa one of the watch or pass worda used by tha conspirators, and as quickly aa the worda could be uttered, he replied, \"And faith!\" His antagonist was astounded. He did not want to fight. He meant murder ! \" Good,\" said the courtier ; \" oan I be of any service?\" \" Help, help, gentlemen, help ! The fellow is most dangerous!\" \" Very,\" said Heron. As he spoke, his aword, or rather the sword of the monk who was called Marquis, passed the sword of his assailant, and ran into his breast. \" Yes. Show me the nearest way out of War wick House, so that I may not be interrupted.\" \" Certainly ! certainly ! Is there any news ?\" \" No \u2014 nothing new !\" \" Ah ! you should have said nothing new over the water. Don't you recollect that thote words were decided upon at our last meeting ?\" \" I do \u2014 I do; bnt I had lost my way in this house, and was getting nervous.\" \" Oh, well, I will soon put you right. Come this way, and no one will interrupt you.\" Felix Heron began to think that the plot which was hatching in the abode of royalty must havo some rather extensive complications, since the first person he met acknowledged so very readily its signals. The courtier led the way along some of tho most disused corridors of the house, and then down a back stairs, and pushing open a door he saiH, \" Thai loads to the smaU orchard, and over yondet is the Green Park.\" With a shriek, the coward dropped to hia knees, and lost his sword. Heron pressed on the spring in the frame of the miiror. The seoret door, of which it was the panel, flew open. \" Good night, gentlemen !\" said Felix Heron. He passed through the opening, and slammed shut the mirror. All this was done so quickly \u2014 indeed, in so much less time than it has taken to tell it \u2014 that the conspirators were too muoh astonished to move or epeik. One of their number lay on the carpet at their feet and Heron was gone. It seemed than like a"], [299, "EDITH HERON. 293 \" Thanks !\" \" Oh, I am only too happy to be of use to yon, although it is a very strange thing that I am not able to find out who you are.\" \" ShaU I tell yon ?\" \" As you please ; but it is sufficient for mo that you are one of us.\" \" Quite,\" replied Heron, \" and that fact, as re gards yon, is quite sufficient for me ; and so good night !\" , Heron passed out into what went by the name of the small orchard, although frnit trees had ceased to be grown in it. Rapidly he made his way to a wall, in which he soon found a door that could be readUy opened from the inside, although noi from the out. CHAPTER OXII. THE REVEREND MORTIFICATION RIPON DOES GOOD SEP.VICE TO CAPTAIN HERON AND LADY CASTLE- NEAU. Heron tapped at the grated window. \" Anthony ! Anthony !\" \" Oh, gracious ! that's another of them!\" cried old Anthony. \" No, no : it is I \u2014Heron !\u2014 Felix Heron ! What do you mean, Anthony ?\" \" Gracious goodness ! all is weU, then !\" Anthony opened the Uttle casement, and was so delighted to see Heron that ho fairly olasped him in his arms. Felix Heron'was in the Green Park, He hastily slipped off the monk's dress and cowl, and rolling them into a bundle, he flung them over the wall again A sentinel of the Foot Guards was keeping a post that divided the Green Park from St James's. \" What is the matter, AnthoDy ? What are you so terrified at ? And why are you up and dressed at such an hour as this ?\" \" Oh, don't you know ?\" \" Indeed, no !\" \" I thoHght you had come here in consequenca ; for we have sent to the forest for you ; but now that I come to think of it yon could not get here so soon even with Daisy.\" \"For the love of goodness, Anthony, tell me what you are talking about ?\" \" I wiU\u2014 I wUl ! There are strange people in the hou.e even now ! Don't you hear that?\" \" I heard a dcor shut.\" As Heron approached, the soldier called ont to him. \" Who goes there ?\" \" A friend,\" replied\" Heron. \"Pass on, friend!\" It was until day-dawn the duty of the sentinel to challenge in this manner all persons crossing his post. Heron thought the man looked curiously at him as he passed, but he had soon other things to think of. \" Yes. About twelve o'clock there came a sharp ring at the old gate-beU ; and when I went to see what it was, four men appeared ; and one of them produced a warrant, and said he had authority to search the house ; and when I asked him what for, he told me to mind my own business, and leave him to mind his\" Making his way out of the Park by the gate at Spring Gardens, where he had to go through the same ceremony with the soldier on duty as he had done with tbe sentinel at the Green Park, Heron found himself at Charing Cross. \"Yes,\" he \u00bbaid, after reflecting for a few minutes \u2014 \" yes, I will make my way to Castle neau House. There I shaU be certain of a welcame, and of refuge until to-morrow, when I can make my way to the forest.\" If Heron had had his Daisy with him, he would have ridden at once to Epping. After, however, all tho fatigue he had gone through, and the many hours be had been with out rest and food, he did not like to undertake to walk that distance. \" What then ?.' \" Oh, they all came in ; and I was so alarmed, that I stood at the gate to see if I could get help; and then a young feUow came by whistling, and I said to him, ' I wiU warrant that you shall have a guinea, if you will make yonr way to Epping Forest and cry out that Captain Heron is wanted at Castleneau House.' \" \"And did he go?\" \" Oh, yea ! He eaid hia name waa Jaok Shep pard, and that he knew Captain Heron quite well ; and off he went at once ; but tbat was only too short a time since for you to get here.\" \" Thank heaven lam here ! Do you mean to say those men are in the house ?\" \" Oh, yea !\" \" But\u2014 but \" To Castleneau House, however, was nothing, and Felix Heron soon found himself by those, to him, well-known old iron gates, which shut in the court-yard. Heron would not ring the bell, which made, when it was touched, such a melancholy tolling, over tbe old gates, but he climbed them, and going rapidly across the court-yard, he took his way round the house. \" Ah, you blame me, and think I ought to have given some alarm ; but what could I do ? They have locked my door ; and here am I, a prisoner in this room!\" He knew that there was a little grated window which communicated with a room where old An thony slept ; and he knew he could very easily climb up to tbat window by a cherry tree which, since the mansion had been built, was fast to ihe wall. Felix Heron hesitated only a moment ; and then \u2014 as ba said, \" Dear old Lady Castleneau in danger! Oh, no, no; that shall not be!\" \u2014 he maCe a rush at the door of the room, and, setting his shoulders to it, he sent it open with such a sud denness that he was very nearly precipitated down a flight of stairs that was immediately beyond it. Heron just saved himself in time, and then ha listened intently to hear what sounds the house should produce. He heard another door shut rather violently,. and then the voices of men. From being originaUy a slender espalier, and getting support from the wall, that cherry tree had grown into stout proportions, and did duty in its turn as a strength and snpport to that portion of the old house which began in places to show some signs of decay. \" Anthony ! \u2014 Anthony !\" \" Yes, Mr. Felix\u2014 yes, my dear boy I\" \" Have yon any powder and shot in the house?\" \"Bless yon, yes!\""], [300, "294 EDITH HERON. \" That is well ; my pistols want charging.\" \" Ov-me this way, then. There's some powder, I know, in the old harness-room, for I saw a flask banging up, and shook it, so that I am quite sure about it\" It was as Anthony said, and Heron loaded both his pistole. In a separate compartment of the powder-flask there was an onnce or more of large-sized shot, so that, in lieu of actual bullets, Heron's pistols were in a tolerably serviceable condition. \" You go to your own room again, Anthony,\" said Heron. \" I will see what all this is about 1\" Tha old man, however, would not leave Felix Heron, and they together descended the grand old giit staircase of Castleneau House. As they aaared the haU, they could hear a loud voice in passic 'iate tones. The precise words that were uttered could not be caught, but they were fairly in the spacious hall. The sumptuously-dressed person looked at his three men, who were armed with hangers and pistols, and looked to the eyes of Heron as like the bull-dogs of Jonathan WUd as possible. But Heron was resolved not to do things by halves. Dashing suddenly forward, he sprung upon the sumptuously-dressed personage, and, seizing him by one arm and the collar, he flung him some dis tance against one of the walls of the room ; and then, pointing one pistol at him and the other at the three suspicious-looking men, he said, \" The first of yon three that stirs from where he is, get3 a bullet!\" \" And so does the second !\" said old Anthony, as he appeared at that moment at the door of the room with an old fowUng-piece, whioh he pointed at the three men. \"Yea, and so does the third!\" said another voice ; and, to the perfect astonishment of Oaptain Heron, the tall, lank form of Mortification Ripon made its appearance far above the head of old Anthony, and presented a blunderbuss of most formidable dimensions at the three men. Then, somewhat to the surprise of Felix Heron, he heard a voice that was perfectly strange to him, say, \" Lady Castleneau, I have authority for what I do; and I am perfectly sure that old SirDominiok Browne, who I have ascertained ia dead, left in your possession a quantity of papers and docu ments connected with the earldom of Whitcombe, aud you will do weU to give them up.\" \"Never!\" They all three fell on their knees instantly. \" Game's up !\" said one. \" All over!\" said the other. \" Done brown I\" said the third. Heron, if his life had depended npon it, must have laughed at that moment; and when the Reverend Mortification Ripon, suddenly seeing the sumptuously-dressed person, turned the huge bell-shaped muzzle of the blunderbuss his way, with a \"Yea, there is another 1\" and the snmp tuoua personage uttered a yell of fright, the picture of the ludicrous was complete. \" Yea I as the Psalmist remarks, I will scatter thea to the right, and I will scatter thee to the left.\" That was the voice of the courageoua old Lady Castleneau. When she eaid \" Never.!\" she meant it ; and Felix Heron felt sure that let the papers and docu ments be what they might, nothing short of down right force would get them from her. He was full of wonder, though, to know who it coul i be that required them. \" You say never, now,\" added the same voice, in the same bullying tones ; \" but a few weeks' solitary confinement in one of the King's gaols wiU alter your tone.\" \"No!\" said Lady Castleneau; \"but if I were not quite unarmed here and in bad health, I wonld make you alter your tone.\" \"Pho! pho! You don't know who you speak to!\" \" No, no ! Help ! Assault and battery I It's Ulegal ! It's \u2014 it's worse than murder !\" The richly-dressed personage could not name personal courage aa one of his attributes. The manner in which he strove to reduce him self into the smallest possible compass, and the way in which he flourished hia arms about, as though ha thought there was a good ohance of catching the contents of the huge blunderbusa before they could reach him, betrayed the fear that beset the man. \"Yes, Idol\" \"Who, then?\" \" A ruffian !\" \" No, madam, I am a nobleman !\" \"An ignoble man, you mean!\" she said. MI fancy you are some housebreaker, who has only the courage to attack women.\" \" Now, then, my men I\" cried the \" nobleman ;\" \" take this lady prisoner ! Sha can be conveyed at once to the new prison at Churton Manor.\" \" Oh, save her !\" eaid Anthony. \" Be satisfied \u2014 she is perfectly safe,\" replied Heron ; and he pushed open the door of the break fast-room as he spoke. \" Lady Castleneau \u2014 dear annt, how do you do ?\" Lady Castleneau uttered a cry of delight. \"Felix! Felix! dear Felix!\" Felix Heron looked at him with contempt. \" Be you who you may, sir,\" he said, \" it is evident that yonr courage only reached the length of enabling you to bully a lady.\" \" And in that the wretch was mistaken,\" eaid Lady Castleneau, firmly. \" Truly, aunt, he was. Mortification, how came you here in London?\" \" Yea ! I came for the spoons.\" \"The what?\" \" Yea ! tha spoons. Hem ! As the Psalmist eomewhere remarks, ' Hidings are seekings, and findings are keepings.' Yea I my respected sponse, Mrs. Ripon, was once in a little way of business that brought that pious woman into communica tion with spoons \u2014 yea, and of forks, composed of sfiver.\" Four men, who were in the room, stepped back with surprise ; aud then one of the four, who was riehly, sumptuously dressed, recovering from the first shock of the presence of Felix Heron, stepped forward, and spoke. \" Sir, may I ask who yon are ?\" \" Yes.\" \"What does he mean?\" asked Lady Castle neau. \" He means, aunt, that Mrs. Ripon made her self useful to gentlemen of what they call the 'family,' by buying of them silver plate that had been come by more easily than honestly.\" \" Yea ' the superfluities of th% vain found their way into the melting-pot of the pious!\" said the \" Well, sir ?\" \"You have asked, and got no answer; but. I ask who you are, and I will enforce an answer ?\" \" Yes,\" cried Lady Castleneau, -' that is right\""], [301, "EDITH HERON. 295 Reverend Mortification ; \" bnt, in thia case, Mrs. Ripon has hidden Oh, what was I about to say ? These wretches have long ears, even like unto those on the head of an aes, and they listen to my words. Yea ! I wiU tell thee, Felix Heron, in private my errand.\" \"Do so, Mortification; and, in the meantime, I appoint you to the post of looking alter these men.\" But the hair was a wig. The sumptuous personage fell on his knees ; and the Rev. Mortification held np the wig in triumph. \" Vanity\u2014 vanity ! Yea, all is vanity ! Thon shalt wear only the six hairs that nature hath given thee, and that Time hath left thee. Yea, go in there!\" _ The woids, \" Go in there,\" appUed not to the richly-dressed stranger, but to his wig, which the Rev. Mortification crammed into the huge bell mouth of the blunderbuss, when it completely dis appeared along with the quarter of a pound of gunpowder and the three pennyworth of mixed nails \" Yea ! what shaU I do if they become obstro polous ?\" \" Blow their heads off with that blunderbuss you have.\" \" Yea ! I will. It is loaded with three penny worth of mixed naUs, which, when projected by the aid of a quarter cf a pound of gunpowder, are apt to be singularly vexatious. Yea, amen !\" \"Murder! Don't! Oh, murder!\" The three men who were the assistants of the richly-dressed personage in carrying out this-out rage at Castleneau House, were so terrified when Mortification Ripon turned the beU-mouthed blun derbuss towards them again, that they rolled over each other as they yelled out for mercy. \" SUence !\" said Heron. Divested of his wig, the pemonage presented the appearance of a keen, crafty man about the middle of life. \" This is infamous !\" he said. \" Tha object is to kill me, I suppose?\" \" No,\" said Heron. \" But kill or not kill, I will kuow who and what yon are !\" \" Tell him, my lord I\u2014 oh, tell him, and he'U be afeard to interfere!\" whined one of the men. \" I wiU tell who I am. Know then, sir, that I am the Earl of Whitcombe 1\" Felix Heron doubted for a moment the evidence of his own senses. There was then a comparative stUlness, and Felix Heron walked slowly over the room to the corner into which the sumptuous personage had rolled, and spoke to him calmly. \"Rise, sir!\" \" I\u2014 a\u2014 will\u2014 I \" Could it be possible that this man called himself the Earl of Whitcombe, when that title was his \u2014 Felix Heron's \u2014 beyond all possible doubt ? It was not until, in a voice of surprise, Lady Castleneau called out, \" You the Earl of Whit combe?\" that Heron could thoroughly believe he had heard aright And now we may inform the reader, with whom we have as few secrets as possible, that this sump tuously-dressed personage was no other than that Mr. Boom, the attorney, of the Temple, who had been eo great an ally of Jonathan Wild ; but who, in consequence of the clashing of their interests, had become to the thief-taker so great and uncom promising a foe. With this knowledge, then, all that is mys terious in the appearance of this person at Castle neau Honse wUl vanish. \"Rise, I say, sir!\" The sumptuous personage gathered himself elowly up to his feet \" Come forward I\" He crept after Heron, who took a chair by the 6ide of Lady Castleneau ; and then fixing a stern look upon the coward, whose face was blanched with fear, he said, \" Now, sir, nnder peril of your Ufe, reply to me fairly and truly. What want you here ?\" \"I \u2014 a \u2014 came to ask Lady Castleneau if she had any documents or papers connected with the Earldom of Whitcombe.\" \" The Earldom of Whitcomba ?\" \" Even bo, sir.\" \" And pray \u2014 what \u2014 who \" \" Oh, I had Bome reason. I had information that an old gentleman, named Sir Dominick Browne, had resided here, and as he was connected with the late Earl and his family, I thought he might have had in his possession important letters or documents of a famUy character.\" \"Indeed!\" CHAPTER CXIII.

Don't pester me with your Acts of Parliament !\" Mr. Eoom waa quite delighted at the kind of im pression he thought he had mads by the sudden declaration of his rank. He certainly mistook the looks of surprise that passed between Felix Heron and Lady Castleneau for fear and awe at that declaration of dignity ; he drew himself np accordingly an inch or two higher, and, putting on a stern look, he spoke. \" Yes ; and I can inform you both \u2014 all of you, in fact \u2014 that you place yourselves in the most im minent paril by your conduct towards me !\" \"Yea, shaU I do it?\" said the Rev. Mortifica tion Ripon, as he placed the mouth of the blunder buss exactly at the nape of the neck of Mr. Boom. Now the attorney heard Mortification ask if ho should do something ; and, in alarm at what it could be, he turned suddenly, and found himself actually looking right into the barrel of the blun derbuss. '___,_.. Mr. Boom started back witn a ory of affright, and would have fallen upon or over Lady Castle- \" But \" \" Yes ; be still,\" said the Rev.

I will go with yon, but I will take good care that you are never an arm's length from me ; and so soon aa I lind myself in any danger I will pistol you on the spot\" Mr. Boom turned pale."], [303, "EDITH HERON. 297 \" On those conditions!, and those only,\" added Heron, \" I will go with you.\" Boom considered for a few seconds. why should I not assert it? Answer me that, sir?\" \" Yon need not argue any case of abstract right with ma,\" said Heron. \" I will go with you. Let that suffice. But these rascals must remove from thia house.\" \" Sir,\" he said, \" I will give you credit for be lieving that you were, or are, the Earl of Whit eombe, because you thought yourself, and pro bably are, the representative of the elder branch of the family ; but if I show you a document which proves that the elder branch became cut off from the succession on account of Ulegitimacy, so that the younger cornea in, you wUl be con tent?\" \" I shall be content with anything to which the word proof may fairly apply.\" \" Then, sir, my carriage is in the next street.\" \" Yonr carriage ?\" \" Even so, sir.

If he could get Heron to consent to take any liquid refreshment whatever, it might be done. But was it likely that, in the house of such a foe, Heron would dream of such a thing ? We shall see. As the carriage made its way towards Whit combe House, Mr. Boom rut on a look and a tone of candour, and spokato Heron. \" That you are astonished, sir, at tho claim I set up to the Earldom of Whitcombe I can well comprehend ; and as, if I am not the hair, yon most undoubtedly are, I am full of anxiety to satisfy yon, because by that means I shall satisfy myself.\" \" Well, sir?\" \" Then I will deal with you most candidly, and not only show you the important document on which I found my case, but tell you how I came by it\" \" Go on.\" \" I knew that there was a mystery about my birth and parentage.\" ThiB wa3 a romantic addition by Mr. Boom to his case, which had no foundation at all, in fact, since his father had bean an attorney before him ; and tha only mystery at all connected with him was, that he had escaped the gallows. \" Bnt,\" added Boom, \" I only know that the mystery concerned the family name, and some vague traditions that we were a branch of some very noble family. \" Perhaps,\" said Heron, drily, \" if you come to facts, it will be better.\" \" I will, then. Hem ! I had heard that the family name was Mowbray.\" \" It is quite a matter of notoriety,\" said Heron, \" that the famUy name of the Earls of Whitcombe waa and is Mowbray I\" \"Oh, is it?\" \" You know it is I\" \" Away with them !\" The three iiscomfited bull-dogs were divested of their pistols and cutlasses by Mortification and old Anthony, and looking very sheepish and orest fallen indeed, they left the room to Lady Castle neau, Mr. Boom, and Felix Heron. \" Fear nothing for me, dear aunt,\" said Heron ; \" I can trust myself by myself. I don't think this person will ever dream of running himself into so much peril as to attempt to harm me.\" \" Farewell I You wiU soon return ?\" \" Yes, as soon as may be.\" \" Remember me to dear Edith.\" \" With all my heart.\" \" And kiss a hundred times the Uttle one, for me\" , \u201e , \" That wUl I ; but you forget that I shall be back here before I go to Epping. Now, sir, I am at your service.\" Mr. Boom looked rather pale and agitated. He had cause both for agitation and anxiety. Though believing that Jonathan Wild was dead, Boom felt that there were only two people in the world who in any way with strength could stand between him and his hopes- One of those people was Lord Warringdale. The other was Felix Heron. Now, Lord Warringdale was still a kind of fugitive from justice. The young Earl of Bridgewater had accumulated evidence enough in regard to the murder of hia father to lodge a formal charge against Warring dale on that score. The conduct, too, of Warringdale, as regarded the memorable duel in Kensington Gardens was still to be investigated, so that if he became very troublesome, the meshea of the law could be made to close about him. As regarded Heron, Boom only devoutly and prayerfully wished that he could lodge him safely in Newgate, there to await the issue of all the charges that might be bronght against him. But how was he to do that ? \" I know it, of course ; but I did not know it when I wa3 quite a child, and told that that was the real name of the family.\" \" Go on, sir.\" \" Well, then, I found, on looking over sOme ancient papers of my poor, respected father \u2014 I found a very strange and important memo randum \" If Hsron really kept his word, and did not let him, Boom, out of his sight and reach, why then his, Boom's, life was Heron's life, and the latter was as safe as though in the midst of his band in the heart of Epping Forest Boom considered aU this, and the spirit of murder came over him as he did so. \"Well, sir?\" There was an odd look about his eyes as he got into the coach, followed by Felix Heron. Ha made up his mind to take tha life of his companion, in that short drive to Whitcombe House. \" It stated that ha, my father, was one day going over Westminster Bridge, when he -was followed and implored for charity by a beggar woman, who spoke with a foreign accent. My father being so good a man as he was \u2014 hem \" Mr. Boom seemed to sind it necessary to cough slightly when he told an untruth of moro than common atrccity. \"Being such a good and charitable man, he gave her some money, upon which she looked in hia face and cried out, \" Ah, you are a Weldt !\" \" A what? ' said Heron. But how ? That was the question. When, however, is that a question for long ? When the guilty heart suggests murder, the teeming brain soon evolves the mode by which it may be, at aU events, attempted Poison ! That was the word that soon suggested itself to Mr. Boom. \" A Weldt ! That is a name, you comprehend \u2014 a Dutch name \u2014 Weldt.\" Bnt he required to get a st^-p further even than that. What poison waa he to use, and how was he to manage its administration ? Troublesome questions both ! Now Boom had in his honse in St. James's Street what many people have in their houses \u2014 that is, laudanum enough to murder with, if the victim can but be induced to partake of it. How waa he to get Felix Herou to take some of the death-dealing drug ? It seemed to be impossible! At all events, \" Oh, indeed !\" \" Yes. My father, I daresay, like you, Captain Heron, did not know what a Weldt was, and no doubt he looked surprised ; but the woman then added, in a screaming voice, ' Look for your for tune in the vault by the four kneeling figures at the old tomb in ihe Abbey!' Now these were re markable words, sir I\" \" Very remarkablo !\" \" My father states that he would 'ain have questioned the woman more closely} but, before"], [305, "EDITS HERON. 299 he could do, she mounted on to the parapet of the bridge, and without another word, leaped into the Thames, and sunk to rise no more!\" \" That was more remarkable still,\" said Heron. \" It was.\" \" Pray, sit down, sir !\" \"No!\" \"Nay, I entreat!\" \" You may entreat as much aa you please. X wiU not sit down, as yet, in this house I\" \" I merely wished yon to do so while I fetched the document\" \" And so she was got rid of at the very moment she was of no further use?\" \" I don't know that, sir ; bnt be it as it may facts are facts. My father went to the Abbey, aisd there he searched \" \"And did you imagine that I would aUow you ?\" \" But, sir \" \" Did you fancy that I would let you out of my sight\u2014 out of my reach? No! Let that docu ment be where it may in this house, there is nothing to prevent me from going with you to procure it!\" Mr. Boom could say nothing against this. \" Come, then, sir\u2014 come. Be it so. But you are strangely suspicious!\" \" Not so I\" \" And found just the document he wanted ?\" \" Sir,\" said Boom, with the air of one who feels that he is unjustly treated and offended, \"you are incredulous : but here we are at Whitcombe Honse, and you shall lee the document yourself, and form your own judgment upon it. You wiU then, per haps, do me tardy justice.\" \" I have offered to pledge my word and honour that I wiU do nothing to endanger your safety.\" \" I refuse the security !\" Boom bit his lips, and looked savage ; but he said no more on that point- Preceding Heron, he conducted him to that suite of rooms in the house that had been in the special occupation of Edith. CHAPTER CX1V. FELIX HERON RETURNS TO EPPING FOREST, ABD PREPARES HIMSELF FOR ADVENTURES ON THE ROAD. The coach did stop at Whitcombe House. That coach which had npon its panels the coat of arms which Felix Heron felt of right belonged to him. There waa the ante-room, the bed-chamber, and the Uttle dressing-room, with the private door in the wall, through which the infamous John Tarle ton had made his way, to work for a time so much mischief between Edith and Felix Heron. It was a strange feeling with which he trod on tha threshold of that mansion of his father's once more. No wonder that Heron sighed and felt his heart. beat with unwonted emotion at the sight of those too well-known apartments. \" Is it here ?\" he cried. \u2022 How many adventures he had had beneath its roof! How little did he expect ever to enter its hall under circumstances like the present ! The house was lighted and inhabited. There was no glare \u2014 no ostentation about the placa \u2014 and the one footman in tha hall spoke of a very modest establishment : bnt Btill there was the fact pressing npon Heron's attention that a stranger had taken possession of the house of hia father, and really claimed it \" This way, Captain, if you please.\" Boom led the way. There was something reaUy provoking in the manner in which this man presumed to do the honours of his own honse to Felix Heron. \" Yes. Do not be impatient I\" \" I am not : but yet it does appear strange to me how, until some course of legal proof has been gone through, yen could bave possession of this house!\" Mr. Boom laughed. \" Be serious, sir, and reply to me I\" \"IwUl. Possession, Mr. \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 Captain Heron, is nine points of the law I I took possession, then, of the honse in a quiet, modest kind of way ; and I want to be turned out of it, if any one has the power to do so.\" \" A most insolent proceeding, sir !\" \" No, no ! Only vigorous \u2014 that's aU ! Vigorous, my dear sir ! But here is the document ! You will not faU to see that I look upon you as a gentleman, as well as a cousin !\" \"A what?\" But the latter was resolved to see the affair out. One thing, too, he did not forget for a moment ; and that was, not to lose sight or reach of the attorney. Boom felt this ; and but that he thought it pos sible to destroy Heron quietly in some other way than by the law, it would have been more irksome to him than it was. \" A cousin ! I am of the younger branch of the Whitcombes \u2014 yon of the elder ; and although the 'bar sinister' of iUegitimacy may obstruct your fortune, yet we are couains !\" Felix Heron, by a movement of one hand, for bade Mr. Boom to dUate further upon the point, and took the document in his hands, which had been really and truly found by Lord Warringdale and Jonathan WUd in the old vault at Westmin ster Abbey. They descended the grand staircase. The staircase that, in the mind of Heron, would for ever be associated with the murder of his father. For the moment he almost forgot Boom, aa the occurrences of that night, and the momentous results that had sprung from them, came vividly across his imagination. But it was only for a moment. Felix Heron laid his hand upon Boom's arm, and they went together iuto that drawing-room, with its beautiful sea-green silk hangings, where he, Heron, and Edith had held together the only unsatisfactory and painful words thst had ever passed between them. Heron sighed. Mr. Boom looked malignant. It was the original document With aU his cleverness, and aU his unscrupulous violence, Jonathan Wild had never succeeded in setting hia eyes on anything hut a capital copy of that document from the night when it first came into the handa of Boom. Felix Heron read the old parchment through with calm surprise. \" WeU, sir ?\" said Boom. Heron looked up, and then he turned the doon- ment over and ovet"], [306, "300 EDITH UEr.ON. There wa3 such an air of genuine and un doubted antiquity about it, that he felt, if it wera a forgery, it must have been tho produotion of the most skilful hands in the world. \" WeU, sir ?\" said Boom again. \" I have read it.\" \" And you acknowledge tha proof ?\" \"The statement!\" \" No, no I\" I; I eay yea! If that wera not the case\u2014 if you really had been a oonsiu of mina \u2014 I would no more have thought of depriving you of thia docu ment than I would have thought of taking one of yonr ojea from you.\" \"Oh! oh!\" \"But, as it is, the oasa is different; and now, sir, as I am at home\u2014\u2014\" \" At home ?\" \" The proof, sir !\" \" No ! Here ia a statement, but no proof I That has stiU to come, Mr. Boom.\" \"Yes, iu my own house, whioh I only left a few short mouths ago \u2014 I mean to assume the mastery of it !\" \" What \u2014 what do you mean to do ?\" Heron put up the pistol, aud looked at his watch, at the same time that he took good care to keep an eye on Boom. \" I see it is about time for an early breakfast, so I will partake of that meal in the green dining room, and you shall sit by me. I cannot think of being without your good company.\" Hope sprung up again in the heart of Mr. Boom. He seemed to see the principal difficulty in the attempt to poison Heron vanish at that moment, and the game to be all his own. Ha breathed more freely. He tried, by a kind of hypocritical assumption of candour, to throw Heron off his guard. \" It would ill beoome me,\" ha eaid, \" to be harsh to the man who, by a freak of fortune, has lost such an inheritance as that which might have been yours.\" Heron sniUed with a certain expression of scorn, whioh induced a feeling in the mind of Boom to the effect that his visitor was a man who saw through hia flimsy devices muoh easier than he had imagined. Like aU very cunning people, Boom got angry at the idea of being found out. \" Be it so, then, Captain Heron,\" he cried. u If you choose to be at war with me, do I\" \" I did not speak.\" \" No, sir ; but you looked all the defiance that your tongue did not utter.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Sir ?\" \" I wiU trouble you to give mo now my proper title ; and, since I am in my own house, to caU me my lord !\" \" Good heavens!\" \" SUence, sir ! Let me have no profane lan guage in this house ; and, least of aU, in these rooms.\" Mr. Boom fairly staggered back aghast at this new turn that affairs appeared to be taking. Then he raised a yell \u2014 a perfect yeU of fright and despair. FeUx Heron had calmly folded up the all important document, and put it into tho breast pocket of his coat. \" No, no ! Give it me ! Give it me ! I cannot \u2014I wUl not part with that !\" \" You have, sir 1\" \" On my life, no I Your honour \u2014 your faith ! This is a robbery ! Give it to me ! I will raise the house ! I will have you apprehended, and cast into gaol ! I \u2014 I \u2014 wUl, if you do not return it!\" \" I keep it !\" \" It is mine ! I found it 1\" \"And are you so poor a lawyer as to think that what you find you may keep? Pho, pho, Mr. Boom ! This document concerns me much more closely than it does any one else, I assure you ; but if it be any consolation to you to know it, I here tell you that if the statement in this paper be true, I would no more touch one guinea of the rent-roU of the Whitcombe estates than I would grasp a red-hot coal !\" \" In mercy \" Mr. Boom fell on his knees. \" Yes, sir \u2014 indeed, you did. I deoline, sir, to sit down to breakfast with you.\" By this time they had reaohed that pretty graen drawing-room which Heron had mentioned ; and on those worda from Boom, Heron stepped at once between him and the door, and spoke with a /\"\".1m decision of tone that let the baffled 1\u00bb\" > ei see that he really meant what ho aaid. \" Listen to me, sir. You have c sen to plaoe yourseU in a position of peril \" \" Peril ?\" \" In mercy, let me have it back !\" \" No \u2014 I keep it ! RacoUect, sir, that possession is nine points of the law !\" \"It is\u2014 it is! Oh fool! fool! fool!\" \" Meaning yourself, of course, Mr. Boom ?\" \" Yes, I do mean myself, Mr. \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 High wayman ! Mr. Robber !

Give it to me \u2014 oh, give it to me ! \" Yes. No high position, suoh as that to which you aspire, can be held without peri!-, .nd the higher the position, the greater the danger. \" What price do you eet uoon it?\" \" My lisa !\" \"Your life?\" \" ' TJnoasy lies the head that wearj a crown, * \" Yes ; and yours !\" \" Ah I\" and you, sir, shall find that uneasy shall {ia the head that aspires to a coronet 1\" \" What \u2014 what do you mean ?\" \"I mean, that as this is my honse \u2014 although, for reasons that you can have nothing to do with! I do not choose to inhabit it \u2014 no one else shall~< at loast, without my leave.\" Boom touched the beU-rope. \" At your peril I\" said Heron. The gleam of the bright barrel of a piatol warned Mr. Boom that he was going a littla too far. Heron presented a pistol at tha head of Boom, who cowered down before it \" This tumult and noise that you are making,\" added Heron, \" will spread an alarm which might be inconvenient to me, so it must be repressed. I command you to be quiet, sir !\" \" I \u2014 I \u2014 am quiet\" \" That is well. Now you know as well as I do that the first idea that ever entered yonr head about being in any way connected with the family of the Whitcombes, waa because you saw your way to a gigantio fraud.\" He let go the bell-rope, aa though it had sud denly turnad red-hot in his hand."], [307, "EDITH HERON. 301 \"Now,' sir,\" added Heron, \"sit down. lam, and I wUl be, the master here ! I intend to break fast here, in my own house. You shall partake of that meal with me, and then you shall depart and once more Whitcombe House shall ba iX signed to the gloom which the deeds tbat have been enacted in it, to my mind, require.\" - Boom sat down. \" Where, then ?\" \"Above, in one of the cabinets. Let me get it I swear to you \" \" Peace ! I will go with yon.\" \" With all my heart.\" Felx Heron accompanie'd Boom to one of the rooms above, and the lawyer procured the bottle of laudanum, which, to hia great vexation, waa the only poiaonoua agent he had in the house. \" This is it,\" he said. As he spoke, he affected to turn the bottle up to his lips and partake of some of its contents; but he took good oare that not a single drop passed hia lips. Putting, then, the vial in hia pscket, Boom pretended to draw a long breath as he spoke. \" That revives me. I am better. And now, aa it is to be so, let us go to breakfast, Captain\u2014 I mean, my lord\u2014 since you have a fancy for th9 title, and will be caUed so.\" \"It appears, sir,\" he said, \"that I am in tho hands of \u2014 a \u2014 a \" \" Beware !\" \" WeU, I am a prisoner.\" \" Precisely.\" \" Be it so, then.

Do you candidly think, now, that I conld trust you ? I know, and you know, that that there is a price upon my head I You might not care so much for the price as you care to see me confined. If I let you go alone, yonr first effort will be to bring the constables upon me; and then I should be obliged, perhaps, to kiU some two or three poor devils in my own defence.\" \" I wiU give my word of honour \u2014 I will swoar to do no such thing 1\" \" Ah, now,\" said Heron, \" I am sure you would betray me I\" Boom bit his lips. Captain Heron rang the bell. A servant promptly answered tbe summons, and stood expectantly looking at Boom ; but it was Captain Heron who spoke. \" Breakfast, and as quickly as possible I\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Hold, feUow! You should say, 'Yes, my lord!'\" \" I beg your lordship's pardon. I \u2014 I \u2014 did not kuow your lordship was a lord!\" The servant retired. \" Now, sir,\" said Heron, \" I tell you what I wiU do. I will cause every possible inquiry to be made myself, in regard to the story about the Ulegitimacy of the elder branch of the Whit- combes ; and if I find it true, I will then seek for the heir of the younger branch ; and if I find that heir in you, why, I shall be the first person to congratulate you npon the succession ; for I tell you, as I told you before, that I would not wear tbe coronet of this earldom, unless I thought it really toy own, for the world's wealth.\" Boom leant baok in his chair. He did not speak. He looked ill. Heron continued. \" And in order that, if you are a base pretender, you may be hanged, as yon deserve, I mean to hold you as a prisoner in Epping Forest until I eee ground for proving your pretensions.\" \" I\u2014 am\u2014 not\u2014 weU !\" \" I cannot help it\" \" Bat Captain Heron \" \" My lord, you mean ?\" \" WeU, weU, my lord; I am not weU. I am under medical treatment At stated hours, if I do not teke a draught that has been prescribed for me, I faint\" \" Take it\" \" K is not here.\" CHAPTER CXV. JONATHAN WILD MAKES A VERY UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE. F;xix Heron fully believed that Mr. Boom would play him some trick, if it were in his power so to do ; but he kept a good watch on him and his movements. The intention of Heron was to make Boom a prisoner, and take him off to the forest at once. It could not be said that Heron believed in the statement contained in the document that had been found in the vault of Westminster Abbey ; but since Boom had taken the strong step of seizing upon Whitcombe House, he felt that he waa quite justified in Baizing him. Upon their return to the green drawing-room tho breakfast was found liid. The atmosphere of the room was impregnated with the odour of coffee, which for some time had btc.me quite fashionable. Baom sat, down facing the windows, and Heron a little ta hia right. \" Sir,\" said Boom, \" I do not and cannot tee why you should be so wroth with me. If you were in my situation, you would in all probability have done aa I have done.\" \" No !\" \" You say no now, because you feel that you occupy an antagonistic position.\" \" 1 think not. But tell me, sir, since yon are, or were, I should say, a friend of Jonathan Wild's, is that disgrace to human nature fairly at length dead and buried ?\" Boom shook his head- \" I cannot exaotly say that he is buried ; but there is no doubt he is dead.\" \" Waa he, then, hanged sufficiently at Ty burn?\" \" He waa ; and upon being taken to hia honse, it would appear that there waa a great desire on the part of the surgeons to get hia body for dis section ; and an attack waa made upon the house of the most extraordinary character.\" \" What character ?\" \" I call it extraordinary, because a keg of gun powder must have been brought and actually ex ploded in the passage, so that amid the confusion and the terror his dead body was carried off!\" \" That is the story, is it?\" \" I think it the truth. Ah, lost ! All is lost 1\""], [308, "EDITH HERON. 302 Boom was satisfied- He made sure that Heron had drank some of the drugged coffee then, be cause his cup was not placed the same way, and Heron made a wry face aa he said, \" Don't yon think this coffee has an odd taste, sir ?\" That remark, to the mind ef Boom, was quite decisive. Heron, he felt convinced, had drank the drugged coffee. \" No, no !\" he cried hastily ; \" not at all\u2014 I caunot see that at all. I feel quite sure that it is the real mocha so much esteemed \u2014 so much You see, I finish mine Yon do the same, and then we will talk of business\u2014 of\u2014 of Eh? It has an odd taste !\" Mr. Boom sprang to hia feet, and looked to wards the windows, clasping hia hands, as if in despair. , It waa not in human nature not to start and take some notice of the agitation of Boom, and FeUx Heron sprang towards tbe windows at once eagerly. \u00a3oom took the opportunity of decanting from the laudanum vial at least a couple of tea spoon fuls into the coffee of Heron. \" What is it ? I saw nothing.\" \" A child \u2014 thank heaven !\" \" What child ? What is there more than usual to thank heaven about ?\" \" A little child was as nearly as possible falling out of that open window opposite, but it baa now been enatched in. My heart waa in my mouth ! I am so fond of children !\" \" You look so,\" said Heron, sarcastically. He sat down to the table again. He looked slowly and oarefully about him. That Boom had perpetrated some villany he fully believed ; but what it exactly was he felt rather at a loss to decide in his own mind. Captain Heron blamed hia own want of nerve at the moment very much, that had induced him to fly so precipitately to the window, and eo give in to the mock alarm of Mr. Boom. He was resolved to pay tho lawyer back in his own coin. \" I told you so.\" Boom glared into the eyes of Heron. He thought he should be able to read there if a_ny trick had been played him; but Heron conld bear this human gaze better than Boom himseU, bo the lawyer took nothing by it. As Boom looked, however, at Heron, the vague suspicion of foul play that had induced the latter to change the coffee-cups became a certainty. A strange and awful look of mortal sickness came over the faca of Boom. Black circles surrounded his eyes, and his head moved from side to side, as if quite involuntarily. \"Help!\u2014 help!\" Boom clutched at the table, and no doubt that splendid green drawing-room swam before his agonized gaze Uke the heaving sea. \" Help !\u2014 help !\" Heron rose- \" Hem !\" said Boom, with an air of satisfaction, as he lifted his cup ; \" this is beautiful coffee !\" Before Boom could be well said to have the last word of this speech past his lips, Heron sprung up at least a yard from hia ch*ir, and uttered a howl that would have been sufficient to alarm a tribe of Indians. \" Aud this,\" he said \u2014 \" this is what it was in tended by this vUlain that I was to suffer.\" A rush of horses' feet in St. James-street at this moment attracted the attention of Captain Heron, and ha darted to the windows. It was not a yery unuaual thing for horsemen to clatter down the rather steep descent of St. James's Street; but Heron felt a kind of impulse ut that moment that he could not account for, which made him fly to the windows which com manded so good a view of the street He did not repent the impulse.. Three horsemen had halted by the kerb-stone opposite the hall-door of Whitcombe House. Two of these horsemen were big, coarse fellows, with top-boots and riding-whips, the handles of which were positive bludgeons. The third was a man in a scarlet coat, turned up with lace, and the tall boots that went by the name of Hessians, being borrowed a3 a fashion from the cavalry of that name. This man, then, in the scarlet coat and Hessian boots, was in the act of dismounting from a very powerful black horse, at the instant that Felix Heron looked from the window of Whitcombe House down upon him. The effect upon Boom was instantaneous. He slipped off his chair, and scrambled under the table, in a state of the most abject terror. The moment his head disappeared, Felix Heron adroitly changed the coffee-cups. \"Gracious powers!\" said Boom, \" what is the matter? \u2014 oh, what is it?\" \" Nothing now,\" replied Heron. \" Nothing ?\" \" No. AU ia over. It waa that child again 1\" \"WhatchUd?\" \" The same one, no doubt, that you saw opposite on the point of falling from the window. Your account of it affected me deeply. I watched the window, and the little, careless innocent came to it again. I saw it plainly.\" Boom uttered an imprecation. \" But at the moment that the catastrophe was about to happen, the same servant you saw, who seems to take a delight in harrowing our feelings, appeared, and dragged it in.\"1 Boom crept out from under the table. \" Captain Heron \" \" My lord, if yon please!\" \" Well, well, my lord, I fancy you have dona this only to alarm me. Tin re was no chUd!\" \" Indeed, there was as much a child on this For a few seconds Heron only saw hia back, but when tho man had fairly got his left foot out of the stirrup and stood on tbe pavement, he turned and looked up at tho mansion Felix Heron's recognition of him waa imme diate. occasion as on the former, wheu you cried out aud alarmed me!\" \" Jonathan Wild !\" he exclaimed. Boom looked carefully at the table. Was there anything done? Had Heron put aside his coffee, or had be drank it? No ; all was as it had been. Boom perfectly recollected that Heron's cup had been fml, while his, Boom's, was only about two- I birds; so that Heron, too, had sean that, aud had adroitly tipped over some of Boom's cup into his, whioh had made all the apparent difference ag\u00bbir. Yes ; it waa indeed Jonathan Wild, who, with a scowl of moro than usual ferooity on his brow, glared up at the front of Whitcomba House. \" Not dead!\" was Heron's next exclamation. No; Jonathan WUd was certainly not dead, for there he was, iu unmistakable identity, more showily dressed than Heron had ever seen him before, Wild turned and gave some order to the two"], [309, "EDITH HERON. 303 men in top-boots, in reply to whioh they touched their hats ; and then, walking wide, aa was hia habit \u2014 for he always went along in a strange, slouching manner, as if he had gyves on his limbs \u2014 he crossed the pavement and knocked a startling peal at the hall door of Whitcombe House. drawing-room at Whitcombe Honse, at the very moment that Jonathan Wild came in at the door. Wild paused at the threshold of the room. \" Hilloa 1\" The shout he gave was loud and brutal. It failed, however, to rouse Mr. Boom. Jonathan Wild then walked up to the table, and laying hold of Boom by tho hair of his head, he lifted up hia face. \" Hilloa ! So, my lord, this has been the little game on your own account, has it, eh? Oh ! Hilloa! what's all this ?\" The baloony on tho first floor projected too far for Heron now to see Wild. But he heard him plainly enough. Upon turning from the window, Horon saw that Mr. Boom had let his heal droop upon the breakfast-table, overturning his cup and saucer as he did so, and that he waa quite stUl. \"If you be dead, vUlain that you are,\" said Heron, \" it is bnt a just retribution.\" He did not pay any more attention to Boom then, but he went out of the drawing-room as far as the head of the grand staircase, and listened. He heard Wild's voice. Boom was livid. His eyas were closed, and his teeth were fast clenched. There could bo no mistake about the fact \u2014 Boom was dead ; or if any life lingered in him, it was abont the region of the heart only, and not to be distinguishable by the face. \"Why, what's the meaning of this?\" shouted Wild. \" Has the fellow taken heart, and gone and poisoned himself ? Ah, I scent laudanum ! So that's the end of it, is it?\" \" Is the Earl of Whitcombe within ?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \"Then tell him No; I wUl go to him! Don't teU him anything, but tell me wbere I shall find him.\" Jonathan glared about him. \" WeU, so be it. Nobody can say I did it I Ha, ha ! I feel like the man on the desert island now. I am monarch of aU I survey. A good job, too, I have made of my little journey to France. Ha, ha! I eoon knocked the old woman on the head at that hunting lodge at what do they call the place ? \u2014 Vincennes, in France ; and now I have aU the papers and letters of the farmly that I wanted. And so, old Boom, you thought to steal a march upon Johnny WUd, did you ? Ha, ha I Well, I suppose you saw me from the window, and then, finding the game was np, you havs taken the last potion, eh? Ha, ha' Get out!\" Wild kicked the body of Boom off the chair, and sat in it himself. \" The Earl, sir, is at breakfast,\" interposed the half-frightened footman. \"Bah!\" \" And he has a gentleman with him, sir !\" \"Bo!\" \" If, however, sir, you will give your name, I will go and say you are here.\" \"Don't you know me?\" \"No, sir.\" \" You are a lucky fellow, then ; and, iu the meantime, get out of the way. I am pretty sure I saw a face at the drawing-room window.\" Jonathan WUd laid the lash of his riding-whip smartly around the calves of the footman, which mado him execute quite a frantic dance in the grand hall. \"What!\" roared WUd, \"are they real? I thought all you feUows had false calves. Ha! ha! I quite congratulate you, my friend. Ha! ha!\" \" Let's see \u2014 anything good to drink ?\" Ha looked over the breakfast-table, and then made some of his hideous fat_.es, as he saw there were no spirits. \" Bah ! bo ! All stuff ! Coffee, indeed ! A drop of good old brandy, the colour of mahogany and the heat of a flame, is worth all the tea and coffee, and suoh like stuff, in the world ! \" A gentle tap came at the door of the room. \" Come in 1\" roared Wild. While the footman was roaring and dancing with pain, WUd made a dash up the grand stair case, swearing dreadfully as he went. Felix Heron retreated into the drawing-room. He had just time to slip behind the gaily painted screen, which was close to one of the windowa, when WUd pushed open the door. Tho reader wUl not faU to perceive how fre quently these \" screens \" are mentioned in the course of narratives like the present, which bear date, as regards the time at which tha persona lived and spoke, abont a hundred to a hundred and fifty years ago. The fact was, that at that period no room was considered to be furnished without one or more of them. A terrified servant appeared. \" Well ?\" \" Why, sir, I \u2014 a \u2014 that is, we heard some noises, and we thought, perhaps \" \" What ?\" roared WUd, in a voice that rang through the air like the growling howl of a bear in a state of frenzy. \" Why, sir, we\u2014 a \u2014 thought his lordship, per haps, might want something.\" \"No, he don't!\" \" But, sir, we \u2014 a You speak, Jobson.\" Several heads and faces now appeared behind this servant, and it seemed to be pretty clear there had arisen a general alarm in the household tbat Mr. Boom had got together in Whitcombe House, Wild looked rather pleased than otherwise. \"Well, what is it?\" They were sometimes at leaat twelve feet high for lofty apartments, and had as many as six hinged divisions. In aU the old engravings of interiors of that period they wiU be seen, and large sums were laid out in their adornment - It might have been a mere fashion, or it might have been that the doors and windows let in more draughts than they do now, but we incline to the former opinion. Screens had their day aa fashionable pieces of furniture. They have no w gone out, and that ia all that need be said. Another servant stepped . forward, who had more courage than his companions, and said, with some show of firmness, \" We want to see and to take orders from our master.\" '\"Ah! so you shall!\" \" And we should like to know who you are.\" \" Oh, indeed I\" \" Yes, sir ; aud so \" \"Silence!\" FeUx Heron then stepped behind a very beau tiful and oostly screen which was in that green The man stepped back a pace or two."], [310, "EDITH HERON. 304 Heron could not think, for the momeut, what was the eause of this change in the demeanour of the thief-taker. \" You say you want to see your master,\" added Jonathan ; \" and I say you shall. Look at me 1 \"At you?\" \"Yes. You say you want to speak to your master. Listen to me, and speak away !\" But he ought to have divined it, and expooted it, aud he soon saw what had taken place. The same tall pier-glasa which had reflected to the eyes of Heron tha hideous lineament3 of Jona than Wild's countenance, likewise refleoted a por tion of the ecreen behind which Felix Heron was hidden ; and just round the corner of that portion, it likewise reflected the face, or the npper part of it, at all events, with the eyes of Heron. That was what Jonathan Wild had seen. _ That was what filled him with consternation. For several seconds\u2014 perhapa while with mo derate speed yon might have counted ten\u2014 did Wild glare at this vision in the glass. He doubted for about that period of time pro bably the evidence of his own eyes ; and then, no doubt, he fairly made up his mtnd that it waa no other than FeUx Heron whose image he saw hia the glass. Jonathan uttered an exolamation of alarm, and half sprung to his feat. But he had to deal with one who waa aa soar less as himself, aud much more active. \"To yon?\" \" Yes. I am your master\u2014 and one, too, that will let you know it! Perhaps, you would like exactly to know my name, in case anybody should call? Well, I don't mind telling you that\" \"What, sir?\" \" Jonathan Wild !\" He made a face, as he spoke, more hideous\u2014 if that were possible\u2014 than any he had before ma naged to perpetrate. At the sound of that well-known and mnch dreaded name, and at tbe awful face that accom panied it, the servants beat a rapid retreat \" Ha, ha!\" roared Wild, as they went. ' \"Ha' I'm a beauty, ain't I ? Ha, ha ! Well, this ia a snug sort of a crib, thia is ! I begin to think I might do worse than imitate old Boom, and take up my quarters in the mansion, as I mean now to go in for the title and the estatea\u2014 ha, ha!\" Felix Heron did not rush forward to seize an old foe, but he made a leap, which at once cleared the distance between them, and brought him with such force upon Wild, that over went the thief taker, chair aud aU, and they both reached the floor. CHAPTER CXVI. JONATHAN WILD FINDS THAT A GREAT CHANGE TAKES TLACE IN HI3 PROSPECTS. Felix Heron was perfectly astounded to hear these words from Jonathan Wild. What could he mean by putting up for tha estates and the peerage of Whitcombe ? Was it possible that the idea had come into tha heads of both Wild and Boom, that the game they both had tried to play waa a possible one ? It seemed so. \" Yes,\" added Jonathan. \" Yes ; I don't see why it should not do. Good lord, how people will stare ! Jonathan WUd a lord! Ho, ho ! That is good ! Well, why not ? Boom ia dead. It will be neces sary, to save bother, that Warringdale ba got rid of. I'll knock him on the head the first chance I have ; and as for that Captain Heron, if I could only see the inside of his skull, I wonld give Ah, what would I not give ? Well, I must try my luck. Let me seo, now ! What is to be done first ? I will go to that young chap in the Temple that is so good a lawyer, and that I have under my thumb, and set him to work. Yes, that ia . Let me see \u2014 I shall want money. The sessions begin o\"- Moa.\u00bb7 Ab ! \u2014 hem ! I oan, I daresay, manage to get a good round doztn hanged this time. That will pay ! Twelve times forty is fonr hundred and eighty\u2014 that wiU be the blood-money, and will put me in cash : but that Captain Heron \u2014 how can I settle matters with him, for he will be a thorn in my side ?\" \"Help! Bull-dogs!\" \"Villain!\" \" Hoy I Oonfuaion I Jannisaries 1 Bull \" Tho hand of Felix Heron was upon his throat, and he began to get very red, and then of rather a purple colour, about tho face. \" Villain !\" said Heron ; \" another cry, and it is your last in thia world I\" But Wild was unable to signify either his as sent or his dissent from this proposition ; and he would then and there have ended his career by a case of strangulation, if Heron had not let him free. Then Wild Jay quite still- \" Dead, I wonder?\" said Heron. He looked dowu into the face of the man who had given him so much trouble, and for a short time he really thought that he had rid the world of the notorious villain. Such, however, was not the ca\u00abe. Wild opened his eyes. He seemed like a man whose recollection of the past had completely gone from him. He looked at Heron without any expression of face that could indicate a knowledge of him. But Felix Heron did not feel inclined to waate time npon watching Jonathan Wild. After what had happened in that room, he was only more than ever anxious to leave the house. \" Lie where you are,\" he said. \" I will not be the man to cheat the gallows of its proper victim ; for if ever mortal man deserved a death at Tyburn, you, Jonathan Wild, are that man I\" Heron stepped lightly to the door of the room. He had reached to within a foot of it, when it waa cautiously opened, and a man looked in. \" Hilloa I Mr. Wild, sir, if you please.\" Heron paused. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \" Ah 1\" Jonathan Wild saw himself in a pier-glaas which was exactly opposite to where he sat in that elegant apartment, and by the faces he made at his own redaction in the glass, one would fancy that ha thought himself too handsome, and in danger of falling in love with his own image. As Felix Heron was situated, he had a good view of Jonathan Wild in that mirror. Perhaps Heron, on this occasion, looked in the face of Jonathan for a longer period than he had ever done before. The man, who was ona of those who had aa companied Jonathan to that house in St James's Street, no doubt for tha purpose of arresting Mr. Boom, knew Captain Heron at once. Suddenly, however, that face assumed an ex pression of consternation and surprise, such as it very seldom wore on any occasion."], [311, "EDITH HERON. 305 He had been in Newgate at the time that Heron was brought there a prisoner. Dashing shut the door of the drawing-room, this man, who was a big, stalwart fellow, set his back against it, and blew a long, keen note on a whistle he had round his neok. Then he shouted out, \" Nabs and grabs ! nabs and grabs I Lots of game ! Here's a gold bird in the crib I Come on, my fancy coves! Here's Captain Heron, with a cool thousand guineas re ward on his toad, and he's done the business for Mr. Wild I\" Heron had good reason to suppose, and to be lieve, that this man and his companion were all tbe assistants that Jonathan Wild had with bim on that occasion ; and it was not likely that he would yield to two men, nor to twice two, even if they had been present It was quite a peculiarity of FeUx Heron that the greater the danger the leas was his exoitement He seemed always to gather coolness in propor- No. 39.\u2014 Edith. tion as other people got info a state of almost delirium from the rapid and exe ting coarse of events. When, therefore, Heron found himself thus be leaguered by Jonathan Wild's buU-dogs, although they were at that time but two in number, he felt calmly and coolly the necessity of getting rid of them. He waited until the stalwart man who had his ba-k against the door on the outer side bad left off shouting. Then, when he stopped for breath, Captain Heron quietly tapped on ths inner panel with the butt of one of his pistols. \" Ah I you may knock \u2014 you may knock ! but it won't do I Come on, my jolly feUows \u2014 here's a gold bird for you 1\" Captain Heron was no doubt caUed a gold bird from the fact that hii capture was worth so much as a thousand guineas\u2014 and, in truth, such was the amount of the reward then offered for him."], [312, "EDITH HERON. 306 to be directed in that quarter of the room; for the man who tiad bad his back agtiust the door just previous to Heron sending a bullet through the panel, had recovered from his panic. True, he had made his way when he heard the discharge of the pistol, all the way dowu the stairs to tbe hall ; but it was only for the purpose oi securing his own eafsty while at the same time he m id- thiuge worse for Heron. \" He's there!\u2014 he's there!\" this man shouted to the other bull-dog, who had accompanied Jona than Wild to Whitoombe House \" He's there, and the reward is ours, as safe as fate !\" \" Where? \u2014 where ? Who do you mean ?\" \" Captain Heron !\" \" Nab him, then, and I'll run for a coach.\" \"Will you?\" \" Yes ; and then, you know, we can share the reward.\" \" I think I see it I Haven't I been shot at, and hasn't the bullet just touched my eye- lids? To be sure it has ! But it isn't you, male, nor I, nor both of us put together, that will nab him He has killed Mr. Wdd, and he would make no more of srttling you and me, than of taking his lunch.\" \" You don't say so ? \" \" I do ; so here goes for a bold push.\" The bull-dog opened the outer door of old Whitcombe House, and stepping ont under the portico, he shouted, as loudly as he could, \" Help ! help I It's a couple of guineas each to all who will help ! Help ! A highwayman in the house ! Help, my merry men all ! Who will take a couple of guineas for a few minutes' work ?\" A cry of such a character, at such a time in tbe morniog, when St James's Street was getting populous with working men goiog to their vari ous employments, was likely to be rather seduc tive. Heron tapped again at tho door. \"Hilloa I hilloa!\" \" What now. eh?\" \" I have a slight remark to make to you, my fine fellow, which it is as well you should hear.\" \"Ha, ha! You are nabbed! What is it?\" \" Simply that I am about to fire my pistols through the panel of tbis door, and as \" The bull-dog of Jontth'in Wild did not wait to hear any reasoning on the point. He was quite satisfied with the expreiaion oi Captain Heron's intention to do as he said. With the greatest possible activity he darted away from the door, and down three or four steps of the grand staircase to the hall. This was what Captain Heron wanted. He laid his hand on the lock cf the door on the moment, to open it But ha was foiled. The door was locked on the outer side. Yet Felix Heron thought it would be as well that he should be as good as his word, and he levelled one of hia email pocket-pistols at the door, about the height of a man's face from the floor, and fired. The bullet went with a sharp crash through the gilt panel- It was that noise that seemed to hi\"\u00bb \u00bb more revivifying effect u^on Jonathan Wild than any thing else \" Murder I\" he cried, ai he eat up and glared about hin with a bewildered look. At the bo ind of Wild's voice, Felix Heron at once turned from tha door and strode up to him. \" You live, villain !\" \" Murder I\" Heron presented a pistol at his h\"ad, but Wild did not seem to be aware of his danger. Pro bably bis faculties were too much confused to enable him to recollect either what had happened, or to he alarmed at what might happen. It was only in a vaguely consistent sort of way that he kept ulteriDg the word \"murder,\" \u2014 that, no doubt being the dominant idea that had found a pUca in his mind. Felix Heron had the life of the arch-villain in his hands, but he could not make np his mind to take it. Some dozen men ran from different parts of the street on to the door-step \" What is it ? Where is he ?\" \" Up-stairs, my men ; I'll follow you ! It's the first door you come to. Break it open, if he has fastened it inside. Hang the oonsequences ! I'll stand all the racket I Run up, and fall upon him I It's a couple of guineas each, recoUect!\" It was decidedly cheap to get some half-dozen, or even a d.zen, men to take all the risk of Captain Heron's pistols at two guineas each, while he, the bull-dog lagged behind, and intended, if Felix Heron were captured, to lay claim to the whole reward of a thousand guineas. The men who ran into the hall did not stop to rtason about the matter. The very helpleasne>s of Jonathan WUd upon this occasion acted upon the geuerous and noble sympathies of the intellect of Felix Heron ; and although he so well knew that a more hardened villain never stepped than Jonathan Wild, and that at the same time he was his most bitter and determined foe, he could not bring himsell to take his life. in a tumultuous fashion, they made their way up the stairs \u2014 not a litile pleased, probably, to get into such a house as that, with liberty to commit BOine depredation in it. They had got two-thirds cf the way up tha stairs, when the door of the green drawing-room waa suddenly opened, and Felix Heron stepped out on to tha landing. A heavy, stumpy pistol was in each band. Heron had taken them from the capacious pockets of Jonathan Wild. With one stride, then, reaching the head of the stairs, Heron paused, and presenting the two pistols full in the faces of the ascending throng of men, he said, quietly, \" What is it?\" They raised a yell of fear, and tumbled one over the other in their hurry to get back into the hull. \" That's him I\" cried WUd's buU-dog. \" That'* oar man! Nab him!\" \" No, no 1 Let the law, which, sooner or later, will surely awaken from its lethargy, as regards such a mau as this, avenge society npon him.\" With these words, Felix Heron turned from WUd, and, as he did so, he heard a strange knock ing on the floor of the room above- she knocking was repeated at intervals of about five or six e.condV duration, and there could be no doubt of it proceeding from some one above, who wished to attract attention in the green drawing-room. Was it a friend or a foe ? That was tha interesting question to Heron. It was a question, though, that he had no means of answering at the moment; but as the knocking continued, and was accompanied by an odd scraping sound, as if some one was at work, it interested Heron deeply. His attention, however, waa not suffered wholly"], [313, "EDITH nERON. 307 Bang ! w, nt one of Heron's pistols, at the same Instant that tbe bull -dog fired one of his own up ward at him. for he now looked np from the floor and shook his head, as though not much was the matter. \"Comedown, Ogle,\" cried Heron. \" I only wish I could.\" \" But why not ?\" \" Bless you, Cap'ain, the joists of the floor are too close together to let a n au of my bulk come through. I don't see, though, why I should not run round.\" The volunteer constables, who in such an off hand, amateur kind of way wanted to earn i couple of guineas each, found themselves in any thing but an enviable position. They were between two fires. Heron was above. The bull- dog was below. The hall and the staircase were full of the smoke and gunpowder. The men were now as anxious to get out of Whitcombe House as they had been to get into it, and they bore down aU opposition with the precipitate character of their retreat. Ogle's face disappeared on the moment. Wild looked at Heron, and in an odd sort of way repeated Ogle's words, \" Ho don't 6ee why he shouldn't come round !\" Perhaps Jonathan was only pretending to be in a state of mental confusion, and was far from being so iu reality ; but whether he was sham ming or not, Felix Heron could not judge. That his escape, however, from Whitcombe House and from London, broad daylight as it now was, depended entirely npon tho success he might have in disposing of Jonathan Wild, he oould not but feel. Boih Jonathan Wild's men were fairly carried out into St James's Street. It was in vain that they swore, entreated, and explained \u2014 they could not for several minutes extricate themselves from the embarrassing posi tion in which they founi, to their cost, they had got entargled. _When they did get back so the hall, Felix .tieron was no longer at the bead of the stairs. All seemed still in the bouse. And yet Heron could not make up his mind to take the life of that man, who would freely, and without the least compunction in the world, have taken his ten times over, if he thought it con sistent with his plans to do so. It waa quite a strange sight to sea Jonathan Wild and Felix Heron in that splendid drawing roo n, looking at each other. Two men, more widely differing than they did, could not by any human possibility have been brought together. Wild such a demon in disposition \u2014 such a baboon in looks. The two bull dogs of Jonathan Wild did not know what to be at. But while they are considering what to do, we will repair to the green drawing-room again. No sooner had Felix Heron ignoininiously routed tbe bull-dogs and their extemporised as sistants, than he made his way back to the draw ing-room, for the mysterious noise in the ceiling had iu tare .ted him. Tbat noise continued. Heron so full of noble and generous impulses, and the perfection of manly beauty. But Heron was prompt in resolves. Wild must be got rid of. If that could be done without taking his life, Heron was glad so to do it; and if not \u2014 well, if not, perhaps the necessity might yet urge him to rid the world of a monster. It came evidently from one particular part of that beautifully ornamented ceiling, and presently there c-me right throngh the laths and plaster the blade of a banger. A rather large piece of the plaster now fell down, and then a voice called out, \" Captain, Captain! are you there?\" \" Is this possible ?\" cried Heron. \" Do I dream ?\" Wild's quick ears caught the sounds that below indicated the efforta the two bull-dogs w>re making to get help to capture Heron, as soon as be, Heron, heard them himself. Both parties felt that upon the events of the next few minutes must hang the issue of the whole transaction. Wild began slowly to scramble to his feet Heron sprung upon him. \" Not at all, Captain. Hurrah !\" \" Is it the voice of Ogle?\" \" To be sure it is, Captain 1 Here I am ! I'ts quite a long tale to tell how I got here, though.\" \" You quite confound me, O^le, by your pre sence \u2014 so unexp cted, too. Ah I now I know! Ob, heaven have mercy!\" \" Why, Captain, whatever is the matter?\" \"There is something wr >ng at the forest! Edith! Edith! Tell me, Ogle, at once, what it is?\" CHAPTER CSVII. \" Nothing 1\" shouted Ogle. \" Nothing in the world is tbe matter at the forest All is as well as can be; only we wondered what bad become of you and Tom Ripon, and that great, long piece of iniquity, Mortification \u2014 that is all, Captain.\" \" But how came you here, Ogle ?\" \" It's too long a tale to tell, if so be, Captain, there should be an) thing to do in the mean time.\" These words completely roused Felix Heron to a sense of his position. There was, in good truth, plenty to do, and it would not ba a prudent thing to leave any of it undone for longer time than was absolutely necessary. One of the most important things that pressed npon the attention of Felix Heron was, how to dispose of Jonathan Wild. Tbe villanous thief-taker seemed to have more lives than the common belief attributes to a cat, JONATHAN WILD FINDS THE CHI3INET OF THE GREEN DRAWISG-ROOM AN UHPLKASA.ST ABODE. Yes, Felix Heron sprung upon Jonathan Wild. He had him by the throat, and as he shook him to and fro, ho announced to him his determina tion. III-..-'- i \" Jonathan Wild, I give yon an alternative. If death shall seem to you preferable to what I pro pose, yon have tut to make your election. It Is aU tbe same to me !\" \" What ?\u2014 what is it ?\" \" You will get up into that chimney.' \u00ab That chimney ?\" . \" Yes. 1 will remove the board whioh encloses it and the fireplace for your special behoof, and jou will get up the ohimney, or die!\" \" Die ?\""], [314, "308 EDITH HERON. combe House ; and when he clasped the hand of Ogle in his, he conld not think that any more danger was to be encountered. \" Bravo I Bravo, Captain I All's well?\" \"I hope so, Ogle!\" \" Of course, it is ! This way, Captain ! There is one who will be as glad to see you as I, and who is not far off !\" \"Even so. I do not swear it \u2014 I do not nse any word of strength or violence to show you that 1 have made such a resolution ; but I tell you calmly that I have made it, and I wUl keep it.\" Wild made a slight movement with one hand, as though he would dive it into the capaoious pocket of his coat that was on that side. The quick eyes of Heron saw the movement on the instant He caught Jonathan by the wrist, and with the other hand he himself dived into the pocket into question. \"What one?\" \" Why, Daisy, to be sure!\" \" Daisy ! You do not mean to say that you have brought Daisy to town npon the vague ohance of meeting with me, Ogle?\" \"It wasn't so vagne a chance, Oaptain, as yon seem to think ; bnt there is no time to tell yon a<l abont it now. Let ns get out of Whitcombe House as soon as we can.\" \" With all my heart, Ogle !\" Under the circumstances, no one could be more glad to get out of Whitcombe House than Captain Heron, and he hastily followed Ogle to tbat room which bad been Edith's own, and in which he had in vain, at one time, required of her an ex planation of the most mysterious viiits of John Tarleton. Wild's pistols were there. \" That is well !\" said Heron. \" I will own that, with the weapons which are my own, and for which I have some respect as they have been my companions in many an adventure, I should have been loth to take your life ; but with these pistols my scruples vanish.\" \"Hold! I content! There is no occasion to commit murder !\" \"Quick, then! Speed is an element in the transaction that I will not remit Heron held both the pistols at the head of Wild, who crawled along with uneasy looks towards the fireplace. Heron removed the fire-board, and pointed to the chimney. Wild hesitated another moment Hei on pressed the muzzles of the two pistols against his face. WUd put his foot on the hob of the grate. \u00ab Quick I\" It was impossible for Heron to oross the threshold of that room without a sigh. The recollections that it evoked were to him of the most painful character. \"Ogle,\" he said, \"let us m\u00bbke speed. It ig dark here, but I think I know the way well.\" \" Hush, Captain!\" \" Listen 1\" \"I am going!\" \" Jonathan WUd, if yon are not np this chim ney by the time I count six, I will shoot you dead here npon the hearthstone!\" \" I am going 1\" \" One, two, three, four, five \u2014 six!\" Wild's bead and shoulders were up the chim ney, and nothing could be seen of him but his boots, as his feet rested upon the grate. Felix Heron immediately replaced the fire screen, and wheeling up against it a heavy table, which was close at hand, he securely wedged it in its place. Situated as he was, Jonathan Wild was in the worst cf all possible positions to exert any strength, so that the table against the fire-board was as good as if it had been a door of triple steel, so far as its strength was concerned. Felix Heron rapidly crossed the room, and opening the door, he made that appearance on tbe landing with Jonathan Wild's pistols that had so taken by surprise the amateur constables that the bull-dog had called in from the street to his aid, on the promise of the couple of guineas each. A strange noise oame npon 'he stillness of tbe room, which sounded like some one making an effort to speak, who, from some mechanical ob struction, such as a gag, was not able to do so. \"What is that, Ogle?\" \" I will open a shutter, Captain, and then yoa will see.\" As he spoke, O.le opened a shutter and let in a full beam of morning light The sight that then presented itself to Felix Heron was one that struck him with astonish ment. On two arm-chairs, set close np against one of the walls, sat two men. They were both tffectually secnred with stout cords, so that they could not move hand nor foot, and they were both gagged with cork, through which ran a piece of wbipcord. Terror of the most absolute description sat npon their faces. As the light from the open shntter fell upon the faces of these men, Felix Heron had no difficulty in recognising them. One he knew full well ; the other he might be said to recognise rather by a combination of emo tions, than because he knew him well. Amid tbe vapour ard smoke of the firearms, Heron heard tha voice of Ogle. \" This way, Captain\u2014 this way I\" The voice came from the next flight of stairs, and Heron at once darted off in tbat direction, effecting in that manner a disappearance that was calculated to puzzle WUd's two men. Felix Heron felt that safety might lie in the direction he now took, for he had a fnll know ledge now of the secret route that existed from the drawing-room, that had been Edith's own, to the stables at the back of Whitcombe House. That one was John Tarleton. The other, who was known so well to Heron, was his late secretary, the vUlanous aud unscru pulous Le Jenne. But how they both came there was to Heron a profound mystery. He looked at Ogle for an explanation. \" Not here, Captain,\" said Ogle, in reply to tbe look. \" 1 will tell yon all about it as we go home ; but in the meantime these two fellows, I think, ought to be hung. There is a good strong brass hook here from the centre of the ceiling, and it goes, no doubt a foot or more into one of the joists ; so my opinion is that it wUl hold them both.\" That secret route that the atrocious John Tarleton had avaUed himself of, on those visits to Edith which had been productive of so much misery and protracted alienation, both to her and to Heron. It was, therefore, with a lighter heart that Cap tain Heron ascended the npper stairs of Whit- At these words from Ogle, which, for aU they"], [315, "EDITH HERON. 309 knew to the contrary, might find a favourable eoho in the breast of Felix Heron, both Le Jenne and John Tarleton began, as well as they were able on account of the gags, to nttei dismal sounds. sit down meekly nnder an accusation which in this code might endanger his life. With vehemence he began to protest his inno cence. \" From first to last,\" he cried, \" this Is the man who has led me astray, from\u2014 from\u2014 the paths of virtue I\" Under any other circ__natances, and if Felix Heron conld only have looked npon these men with ordinary feelings, those sounds would have partaken somewhat of the ludicrous; bnt as it was, the flush that came over the face of Heron looked dangerous* They both saw it They both redoubled the dismal howls. \" Well, Oaptain,\" said Ogle, \" shaU it be as I suggest ?\" Both Le Jeune and John Tarleton tried to cry out \" No I\" but they could not shape the word. Heron quite disregarded now his late most treacherous and vUlanous secretary, and, with his hand raised, and both the pistols of Jonathan Wild in it, be stepped up to John Tarleton. \" Murderer ! Murderer of my father !\" John Tarleton turned of an ashy colour. He thought then that his last hour had been that hour which wanted but another few moments to come to an end. It really sounded something ludiorous to hear Le Jeune make such an expression as \" the paths of virtue,\" and it so provoked Ogle, that he stepped forward and cried ont \" Oaptain ! Captain ! let me rid the paths of virtue, and all the other paths in the world, of these two mortals at once. 1 can't bear to hear them talk.\" \"Let them be! \u2014 let them bel\" said Heron. \"But I will, before I leave them, give them one solemn warning.\" Le Jenne looked delighted. The colour came back to the sallow cheeks of John Tarleton. A solemn warning, in Ueu of the death they both so amply merited, was what they cared as much about as a sermon that might be preached in the next street. Ogle shook his head. \" Captain I Captain ! let me advise !\" \"What, Ogle?\" * Why if you are only staying here for the pur pose of giving these two rascals a solemn warning, you may as well come away at once, for yon are wasting what may be precious time.\" Heron could not help feeling the truth of these words from Ogle ; but the fact was that, as regarded John Tarleton, his near relationship to Edith gave the imagination of Heron a sort of play as regarded him, which he could not wholly control or effec tually set aside. He had a hope that in the nature of that man there must surely be a something that, afar off, so to speak, ought to assimilate in some degree to tho goodness and the virtue of his Edith. Therefore, was it that, stepping up to John Tarleton, Felix Heron spoke with great emotion, saying \u2014 \" For the death of my father I forgive you, and I hope that heaven will extend to you the same mercy. I do so in the name of Edith. It is for yon, if you have one solitary spark of goodness in your nature, to try to fan that spark into a flame ; and in her name, and for her sake, try to deserve the clemency that is extended towards you.\" John Tarleton could not meet the eyea of Felix Heron. It was dreadful to feel death so near to him, and not to be able to cry out for mercy, even if there were no mercy for him in this world or the next. From pale, his face began to turn of a dingy yellow. He looked as if his flesh had lnrned to wax of some strange, sickly, discoloured hue. Surely that villain died many deaths in the ap prehension of the one that he thought he saw ap proaching him. \" Fiend I vUlain !\" said Heron, \" what demon possessed yon to cross me as you have done?\" \" String him np, Captain 1\" laid Ogle. \" I hope you have rid ihe world of old Jonathan Wild, and if we get well clear of these two rascals too by banging them, it wUl be a good morning's work.\" Perhaps it was these words of Ogle more than anything else, that restored Captain Heron to his equanimity, and fairly let him know that he was on the point of giving way to a passion foreign to his nature. \" No ! no !\" he cried at once ; \" do not let me forget I have promised Edith I\" Now what Heron had promised Edith was, that in consideration of aU she had gone through in that very house, in consequence of the vUlany of John Tarleton, he would be merciful if ever chance should throw that notable villain in his way. But they did not \u2014 and particularly John Tarle ton did not \u2014 translate the looks of FeUx Heron in that fashion. It may perhapa be considered that that waa a aort of grace, inasmuch as it served to indicate that all shame had not altogether left him. If it were so, however, it was a grace of a very negative kind, and was not likely to lead to much reformation. Heron then turned to Le Jeune. The horror that took possession of them both, whUe they thought he could be only considering what sort of death he should put them to, was ex treme. In that period of time, short as it was, they suffered the real pangs of many deaths. But of the two, it was John Tarleton who seemed to be a prey to the most abject fear. \" Spare me !\u2014 oh, spare me !\" he critd. \" What ever I have done, either by accident or design \u2014 and it has been oftener tho former \u2014 I have been incited to do so by that man 1\" As well as he conld, John Tarleton made a jerking movement of his head to signify that he meant the viUain Le Jeune. Bnt the latter was not in any way inclined to \" As for you, wretch that you are, yon havs eaten of my bread, and eiijoyed my confidence, and then betrayed me I Take with yon the con sciousness of such acts, aud lire! It would be, and it shonld be, a curse to let you live !\" Le feune was of a different opinion. He thought that the preservation of his Use just then was the very best thing that could happen to him, and he would not seek to jeopardise it by saying a word more in his own behalf. Ogle was not at all pleased at this conduct on the part of Captain Heron. Shaking his head, and muttering to himself, he made his way towards the secret door in the wall of the room through which John Tarleton used to come on those vUlanous visits to poor Edith."], [316, "EDITII HERON. 310 \" Come, Captain V be said. \" Sitice you wou't get, rid of thc.*e _r\u00bbM-als yourself, or let ine do 8\", I think ihe ftouuer we inake our way out of this plmre the belter.'* flardly had ihese words come from tbe lips of Ogl^, than a violent feuock'ng ensued at the door of the outer roi'tu us that buite. ** Open I open !\" cried a voice. \" Open, or your deetruoiijn be upon .your own head I\" It was the voice of one of Jonathan Wild's hie death from the poison be meant for me ; and now Jonathan Wild is smitten with the same mania, and seems to be straining heaven and eaith to mahe himself the possessor of the title.

But tbat waa like tbe drum sf tbe mountebank or the horn of the itinerant showman \u2014 only for the purpose of attracting attention to what he meant to say. So when everybody in the whole of St James's Street waa looking up at the balcony \u2014 when every window almost in every house was flung opnn, Wild, in a high, cracked, hideous, brassy voice, sp ke.

Jonathan Wild seemed to be quite delighted with tbose words, \" Dead or alive!\" for he kept repeating them for at the least a dozen times. \" Dead or alive 1 Dead or alive I\" He leant over the balcony so far, as he roared the two words ont, that Ogle was greatly in hope that he would overbalance himself, and tumble into the street. \" The old rasoal !\" said Ogle. \" Tke hideous viUain I\" was the involuntary exclamation of Heron. And truly Jonathan Wild did look hideous. \" Dead or alive ! Catch him dead or alive !\" he kept yelling ; and as he did so he kept dashing aside the flakes of soot, which, from his head, kept coming down over his eyes, and half blinding him. It was at one of these efforts when he succeeded in partially clearing his vision, so that he took a good look up and down the street, that he saw Ogle and Captain Heron. Now, if Wild had pointed them out at once, and announced them, or one of them, to be the person who was wor.h so handsome a reward as one thousand pounds, he might have created a good deal of possible embarrasstnent to Heron. But, for once in a way, Jonathan Wild had lost that cool, cautious judgment which, aided by the daring of his character, stood him in such good stead on so many most important oocasions. Instead of pointing attention to Heron, he warned him that he was seen by a shout of triumph. Before he could then speak, Heron and Ogle darted round the corner, to where Daisy aud the ooach was waiting, in Fall Mall. Wild was frantic. At first Felix Heron was quite at a loss to con ceive where that shout came from. But it was repeated, and then he was able to localize it easily. It came fro a one of the most extraordinary looking figures the eyes of man ever looked upon, and tbat extraordiuary figure was in the balcony of old Whitcombe House. Imagine a man without a coat, but with his long heavy waistcoat covered with soot. Without a wig, and with a head on which there did not seem to be above twenty bristly-Jooking hairs, but which was at the same time curiously scarred and plastered in various directions with bandages, to cover different outs and contusions that it had received. This head, too, was begrimed with soot, and the face itself was hcrribly black. Black, indeed, as any negro's could be. It was from this disordered and s range-look- ing person that the shout came, which, like the roar of some savage animal, produced conster nation in the polite vicinity of St. James's. Ogle knew the voice- Oaptain Heron knew the voice. They had both heard it too often to have any donbts in regard to its identity. From no throat but from Jonathan Wild's could such a volume of hideous sound possibly come. He saw his prey pass from before his very eyes in this manner. He could not bear to lose sight even of the spot on which he bad seen them, whioh he would have to do if he went back into 'he room, and Uitd to leave the house in the regular way. He began to scale tbe balcony. The height waj about eighteen feet from the pavement. It was an awkward tbing to do, for tbe steps were the only part to which he could descend with any chance of safety ; and it so happened that exactly beneath the balcony came the edge of one of them. But Wild was not in a state of mlod to look at minute and possible danger. He swung his legs over the balcony. \" Catch W I\u2014 cat.th 'em I\" he shouted \u2014 \" alive or dead ! Dead the better now of the two !\" If Jonathan bad fallen upon tbe steps, perhaps he would have broken a limb\u2014 perhaps his neck but he was not destined even to run the risk. It was Jonathan himself. He had by inoredible exertions managed to get out of the chimney ; and then, feeling that to"], [318, "EDITH HERON. 312 It was an evening of such gentle zephyrs, and such bright red sunshine, that the whole forest seemed ohanged to some fairy scene of enchant ment, when Heron, with Edith on his arm, stood in one of the broad open glades of the old wood. The little one was in charge of Mrs. Ogle, who prided herself so much upon her appointment of chief nurse, that she was jealous even of Ediths interference. ...... ,. If Ogle had only been present, and seen what took place, he wonld have been furnished with another argument in favour of his theory, that Jonathan Wild was invulnerable to aU acoidents but the gallows. The accident, then, that saved the great thief taker on this occasion from as fall was just this. Jonathan Wild, since a murderous attack that had been made npon him in the press-room of Newgate, by Blueskio, when that personage had announced his intention of cutting off Wilds head, had always worn a cravat of extraordinary length, folded many times round and round his neck, she long ends being tacked deep into his waistcoat. in it'i or i ,_ l . And Edith looked by that sweet light into tbe eyes of her husband, and a sigh came unbidden from her heart. \" You sigh, my Edith !\" \"Did I sigh?\" \"Indeed, yes! Are you not happy ?' \" I should be. I am happy\u2014 ob, so very happy in the present ; bnt \" \" But what, dear one ?\" \" It is the future which hangs like a cloud upon all this fair sunshine.\" Now, in Jonathan's struggles to get out of the chimney, these long ends had got loose, and swung about As he scrambled over the balcony of Whitcombe House these ends got firmly entangled in the ornamental iron- work next the street Jonathan did not notice the fact, and after hold ing on for a couple of seconds with his hands, he let go to take the drop. And there he hung. Hung by the ends of bis cravat, swinging about, and making frantic efforts to catch at the lower part of the balcony ; while the tightly drawn cravat was drawn ronnd his neck in rather too close contact with his throat to be at all agreeable. Nothing but a ladder would now enable any one to release Wild. But before that could be brought, Ogle had detached Daisy from the old haokney coach, and beckoned to the member of the band who some distance off had his, Ogle's horse, and the one belonging to the guard over the coachman. \" Now, Captain, mount and away 1\" said Ogle. Heron was on the back of Daisy in a moment. Ogle was likewise mounted. \" To Oastleneau House I\" cried Heron, as they started along Pall Mall at good speed. Lady Castleneau was delighted to see Heron, and she wonld not detain him from Elith a moment longer than was necessary ; and soon was he again on the road, with Tom P\u00bbipon aud the Eev. Mortifioation, in addition to his party, so that it was rather a strong one. Heron was silent. His thoughts often fell upon that future, and he would often, amid the silence of the night, ask himself what that future was to be for him and for his hab >. The nature of the Earldom of Whitcombe had assumed a very different complexion in his eyes, since the birth of his son. The question that he so frequently now asked himself, was, ought he to give up all struggle for that title, and that dignity, and those estates, which now were, in reversion, as muoh the property of that son as they were his ? \" Edith !\u2014 dear Edith !\" he said, after a pause, \" I am still the Earl of Whitcombe I\" \" Oh, I did not mean that 1\" \" What then, Edith ?\" \" I want you to \u2014 to \" \" To what? Speak to me, dear heart, with all your wonted confidence! Let me know all you think, and all yon wish !\" \"I will, Felix\u2014 I will!\" Tears were in the eyes of Edith. She spoke with considerable agitation. \" I dread the course of life you are leading, Felix ! I want you to come away \u2014 to bid adieu to all dangers, and to all ambition, except one !\" \" Except one ?\" \" Yes. The ambition to be serene \u2014 to be happy, because contented. Oh, Felix ! there are spots on the earth's surface, and not so far away either, where nature, with a prodigal hand, has showered down many blessings 1 And why should I talk of far away ? Far away from whom ? Far away from what ?

And Heron, in the sweet eyes and the gentle expression of the child, was happy to see a reflex ef the beauty and the expressive glances of his Edith. A week \u2014 a whole week of rest and of such calm conentment, that if it would only last for ever would have been a delight the continuance of which to pray for\u2014 passed away. \" Alas !\u2014 alas !\" \" Why do you cry alas ?\" \" Because I have a thousand fears 1\" \" Banish them!\" \" Oh, would I could \u2014 would I oonld I Bat I cannot 1\" \" Hear me now, Edith, and I will make a bar gain with your fears and with your love!

No pains had been spared by Captain Heron and his men to make these parts of the ruin thoroughly inaccessible ; but to Tom Ripon, at any hour of the day or night, the route was quite easy. Ho diverged a little to that part of the ruins in the special occupation of Oaptain Heron, in order to possess himself of the pistols which certainly had been freely given to him. But Tom was not destined to get off quile so quietly as he thought The first person he encountered was tbe young girl who had been eo gallantly rescued at Tyburn by Ogle and tbe band. It will be remembered tbat Tom Rtpon had at the first glance surrendered his heart to this young girl, and the si^ht oi her now raised up all the flames of love in bis breast \"Oh, oh, ohl\" cried Tom. \" Don't go !\u2014 oh, don't I I have got something so particular to say to you 1\" The girl laughed.

He was quite delighted at the sucoess of a stratagem which it had cost him a long time to elaborate. just then ? Of course she did. But Tom was only a boy, altboogh a precocious one; and in her heart the young girl^ only laughed at the passion sho had evoked in his heart. \"My love\u2014 my life\u2014 my joy \u2014 my hope!

You on the road ?\" He wanted the horse of Captain Heron to go upon tho road to try his own good fortune, as a highwayman. Now the difficulty was to get that horse; so Tom thought that if by any means he could entrap Heron with saying the words, \"go upon the road,\" all would be well. Captain Heron had, as we tee, fallen inlo the snare. When in reply to what Tom had sa'd, Heron exclaimed, \" Go upon the road,\" Tom ran off. He had the words be wanted from Captain Heron's lips, although not in the seme he wanted them. It now occurred to Tom whether to pretend to misconstrue them; and when he, Heron, should say anything about it, Tom meant to call upon Edith as a witness that she had heard Heron say, \" Go upon the road \" \" Hoorah !\" cried Tom to himself as he made bis way rapidly among tbe trees. \" Hoorah 1 \" \" All's right I I mean to have a shy at the Oxford mail to-night !

Bnt en this occasion he was in the dilemma that he did rrt wish to cftend the young girl \u00abho had SO smitten him with her charms, while at the same time he was burning with anxiety to vindicate his own prowess. He had no difficulty in at once recognisiug the voice tbat uttered those words to him as being tbat of Mrs. Ogle. \" Yes,'' she added, \u2014 \" you may well say confu sion ; for yon are, and well you may be, confused !

Oh, miss I say you consent to be the highwayman's bride I Only say yes!\" \"Let me think!\" With this comforting assurance, Tom Ripon took his way to the ruins, and soon equipped him self for the road, in the style that he so much admired and covered. Tom had possession of ssveral articles of cloth iDg belonging to C iptain Felix Heron, for since he had come to the wood, he hud established him self as a sort of valet to Heron, and had taken a pride and pleasure iu brushing off from his clothes every speck of dust or mud. Among these articles was one of the scarlet coats which Heron was, now and then, more to please bis hand than himself, in the habit of wear ing on the road. The coat was not above double the 6iz - lhat Tom required, but still he determined upon wear ing it on this occasion. \" It's is a good fault,\" sail Tom : \" if it were too small, 1 could not wear it at all ; but, as it is too large, I eau do so quite well.\" Tom turned up tho cuffs as high as he could, aud put on the coat. The skirts came very nearly to the ground, and certainly Tom, in fact, cut what might be considered a rather ridiculous figure; but then, as he was going on horseback, a good deal of that effect would go off ; so it did not much matter. Tom had an idea of putting on a pair of Captain Heron's boots, but he thought that if he did he should never be able to get off or even on his horie. \"To be sure!\" \" Go a little way off while I think, Tom.\" \"1 will.\" Tom took long steps as he strode up and down, about a dozen pacea from the youDg girl, whom he could scarcely see in the darkness. Indeed, at times she was completely confounded wilh the shadows, and he could not see her at al). But in the course of five niinu'es Tom got im patient for he was anxious to be off, lest I'aptain Heron should make some icquiry for him, and thwart tbe expedition on which he intended on that evening to go. \" M'ss,\" said Tom, stepping up to her, \" bave yon considered?\" \" fes, Tom.\" \" Dear me, you have surely caught cold, miss, for your voice sounded a good deal deeper?\" -thave, Tom.

Tom trotted on. There was another scout to pass, he well knew, at the extreme verge of tbe wood ; and Tom Ripon, however, he had suffered in his self-esteem by bis interview with the young girl and with Mrs. Ogle, was destined to have his equanimity of soul, in that particular, completely restored by this scout. \"To whoo! to whoo!\" cried the scout loudly, as 'Com emerged from among the trees into rather a n.ore open space. \" Hawks and Herons 1\" said Tom again. \" All right Oaptain!\" said the scout. Tom was delighted. He was actually mistaken for Captain Heron himself. To be sure, it was in the dark, when, as the old proverb says, \" All cats are grey !\" But still it was a gratifying coinci dence \"Good night!\" said Tom, in as deep tones as he could command. \" Good night, Captain, and good luck !\" said the scout CHAPTER CXX. TOM RIPON PURSUES HIS ADVENTURES ON THE ROAD. \" To London.\" That was the announcement on the finger-post which Tom was able to read, and whioh to him was the most interesting, By pursuing the road so poiuted out, he would most assuredly meet tbe Oxford mail. At that time, the mail coaches started from London about eight in the evening, and as they made good speed, by about nine they were tea miles from the metropolis. It was within that tea miles from London tbat all stoppages of mail coaches by highwaymen ever, with very few exceptions, took place. The reasons were these. It was not convenient for the \" gentlemen riders,\" as they called themselves, to penetrate deep into the country ; for if they did so, they fatigued their own horses, and had a long trot back to London again to dispose of their plunder, a market for which could only be found in tbe lanes of London. Another reason was, that the mail coaches ohanged horses at or about the tenth mile out of London. With the fresh horses the highwayman would have run much more risk than witb those that had dragged the heavy vehiole some miles. The favourite spot, then, for such encounters as took place on the road between the ooaches and the gentlemen who picked np a living by crying \"Stand and deliver!\" was about nine miles from London. Tom rode on. \"That will do!\" he said; \"that's the sort of thing ! It is quite clear that, on horseback, I must look very like the Captain indeed.\" Tom was now clear of the forest, and be soon put his horse to a trot \u00bbnd from that to a half gallop, for he was particularly anxious to reach a part of the road, which be knew the Oxford mail would pass, and which he considered was particu larly well adapted for his purpose. The sky was cloudy. Had it not been so, Tom would have had the mortification of discovering that the moon was about a fortnight old, and calculated to throw rather too much light upon the scene. As it was, however, there was only that strange, dreamy looking-light in one part of the sky, which made it appear as if at any moment it was ready to burst out into brightness and dazzling silvery beams. The open country was therefore by no means very dark. But whenever there was timber of any growth by and near bushes or saplings, the darkness was to the full as profound as any gentleman of the road could possibly wish it to be. Half an hour's rather Bharp riding brought Tom to a spot where several roads met and crossed each other, and where a finger-post stood to point out tbe way. Then the mail-coaoh horses had had all the drag through the suburbs of the City, and were quite well disposed to be docile, and much more disposed to stop than to be fidgetty to get along. At those spots of the road, therefore, particu larly if they were gloomy and dark, and shadowed by trees or close to a wood, the guards of the coaches would look sharp The huge bell-mouthed, brass-barrelled blun derbuss would be placed bandy to get at * The outside passengers would put on looks of scared anxiety. The \" insiders\" wonld suspend their conversa tion, and nothing would be heard for tbe next mile or two but the rapid tramp of the horses' feet upon the road. It was, then, on one of these spots that Tom Ripon, with an audacity that the most daring knights of tho road seldom found themselves quite equal to, determined to stop the Oxford mail. Tom, therefore, having ascertained his proper route, gently walked his horse towards London. But some bright lights in the road, or by the side of it rather alarmed Tom, and he slackened even tbe walk tbat he had put his horse to, in order to reconnoitre. These various roads were rather puzzling, and Tom felt the necessity of consulting the finger post But that was not an easy thing to do, since the letters upon it were none of the brightest, and the three or four centuries that had elapsed since it had been visited by any paint, had faded it con .iborably. All Tom could see was tbe word ' To ;' but what followed appeared all a complete jumble. A long ray of light from some window of a house near at hand fell, as it happened, exactly ou tho face of a milestone. \" Ten miles to London \" That was the aiauouucement on the milestcnj."], [323, "317 EDITH HERON. From the moment lhat ho saw it, Tom knew perfectly well where he was, and the meaning of tbe light on the road-side. Those lights came from the inn at which the Oxford mail wonld pull up to change horses. 1 f therefore he, Tom, was to stop the mail, he must ride on further towards London, to give himself any fair chance of success. There he should encounter the jaded horses, but it he waited on the country side of the post-house he would have to stop the new relay, which wonld of course be a much more difficult matter. favoured Tom's proceedings, for the clouds over the spot in the sky where the moon was majesti cally travelling behind them, thickened, and the darkness consequently became much more in tense. The cart in the road-way looked black and threatening, and Tom Ripon himself backed his horse right up to the hedge, until its hind feet almost stuck into the ditoh that was there for field drainage. He leant forward on his saddle, and listened in tently. But to pass the inn withont being observed wae a matter tf some consequence. If he were seen in that scarlet coat, galloping pa-.t, bis profession would be readily enough guessed, and two to one but somo horsemen would be despatched from the inn to the protection of the approaching mail coach. \"What shall I do?\" said Tom. \"How shall I manage that ?\" A distant rumbling sound most unquestlonsbly met bis ears. It might be the mail to Oxford, or it might be some other vehicle upon the road. Tom Ripon made up his mind to take his chance of the first coach that passed, and which should be brought to a stand- still by tbe cart. The rumbling noise increased. The tramp of horses' feet became mixed up with it There was a high, thick hedge on one side of tbe road. On the other was the park paling of some est tte. Far off, there was a faint, moving kind of halo, which Tom guessed to be one of the lamps of the Oxford mail. That it was that expected coach which now ap proached he thought was a matter of peifect cer tainty, from the amount of noise it made. No private carriage could have perpetrated one half the rumbling that the well-laden Oxford mail produced. \" Now for it !\" said Tom. \" It will be here in five minutes, and I shall be as good a highway man as any that ever cried ' Halt >' on the King's highway !\" The halo of light which Tom rightly enough concluded came from one of the side-lamps of the mail coach increased each moment in bright ness. A route into the fields was therefore barred up. But time pressed. Something must be dono, and Tom showed himself tolerably fertile in resources by hitting npon a mode of getting past the inn without ex citing suspicion that he was upon the road for any nefarious purpose. Drawn up on a piece of parish ground, not far from the mile-stone, was a cart The shafts were sticking up iu the air, with some leather traces and a chain or two dangling from them. Now, Tom thought that this cart might be c_ assistance to him in more ways than one, and he determined upon making use of it Dismounting, Tom pulled the shafts of the cart down, and easily succeeded iu slightly and tem porarily putting his horse into them. Then he got on the side of the horse that was furthest from the inn, and started onwards. The cart made a lumbering sound on the road, and cast Tom with his scarlet coat and smart hat and feather quite into the shade. He reached the part of the road close to the inn, and was pursuing his way, when a voice called out, \" Is that Will from Wycombe ?\" \"Noal\" said Tom; \"I be Joe from t'other side\" \u201e\u201e . . , The tramp of the feet of the four horses that drew the vehicle was more and more decisivo, and it appeared to Tom that the pace at which they came along the road materially increased. This was probably true enough ; for the horses knew, as well as the guard and coachman, tbat they were near the end of the first stage, when a change of cattle would take place. Tom felt in tbe holsters of his saddle for bis pistols, and loosened them, so that they would come out readily at the slightest possible touch of his hand. Then his heart beat a little more rapidly than usual, as he saw the mail coaoh tolerably plainly, so far as its outline was concerned, coming on the road. \" Oh ! I thought you were Will, the boy from New House Farm.\" \"Noa, Ibean't\" \" Well, Will, get on.\" \" Ees, I wool.\" _ Tom went on, and in a very few minutes the horse and cart were past the lights of the post house, aud free from all observation. Tom was delighted. \" If everything goes as lucky as this, he said, \u00bb T shall do capitally.\" To ta*_ the horse out of the cart was the work cf a few seconds, ho soon as he had placed a good rr.arterof a mile between it and the post-house, and then Tom resolved upon making the next use of the cart which had suggested itself to That was, to leave it in the middle of the road, in the hope that the le\u00bbding horses of the mail coach might tumble over it. It seemed as if the elements for that night He could see the cloud of steam from the heated horses; and \u2014 but, perhaps, that was only imagi nation \u2014 he thought he saw on the top of the coach the guard, with his red coat, keeping more than ordinary watch and ward, with the blunder buss in his hands. But Tom would not draw back. His resolution was wound up to a pitoh of in tensity that enabled him to commence the adven ture, and chance all that might come of it Another minute, and the mail coach was within a couple of hundied yards of where Tom stood. It seemed to him then as if the four horses ac celerafd their speed from that moment, and he felt how impossible it would have been to stop them, unaided by the obstruction on the road, in the shape of the cart ___,_.\u2022_ . The guard of the Oxford mail took his horn out of the wicker case in which it hung, aud placed it to his lips, to give the usual signal to the people"], [324, "EDITH HFRON 318 imaginary band at bis heels \u2014 \"kiep ba<-k, snd re serve your fire till you get my order I Now, ladies and gentlemen, your money, watobes, pocket books, trinkets, or your lives or both together, if you like that better. Don't fire, my gallant comrades!\" Tom reaobed the coach window, and with an ostentations violence clapped a pistol barrel on to the ledge of it, and looked into tbe coach. The coaeh was full. Not a seat was unoccupied, and at any other time Tom Ripon wonld have laughed outright at the sprctacle that the inside of lhat coach pre sented. There were two ladies and four gentlemen. One of the ladies fainted at once, or pretended so do so, Tom could not Uke npon himself to say which. at the roadside post-bouse to get out the relay of horses. Odo blast only came from the horn, when tbe coachman cried out in a voice of alarm, \" Woa! woa! woa! By jirgo, there's something as b'ack as roy bat in the road, and blocking up the way !\" CHAPTER CXXI. THE OXF ED MAIL M?ETS WITH A DISASTER, WHICH T-. M UP NT KES ADVANTAGE OF. Jt would seem tbat the two leading horses of th* Oxfoid mail saw the cart in the road at ihe same moment that tbe coachman did. That was either the case, or the coachman alarmed them by pulling up suddenly. Whichever it was, the consequences were the 6ame, for the bcrses reared, and the other two behind them came upon their haunches so sud denly, tbat that of itself was enough to throw them down. The other seized the Quaker, who eat next her, with a nervons grasp at tbe throat, that made him think at the moment she was a female accomplice of tbe highwayman. One of the gentlemen opened the door on the other side of the coach and sprang out. The other two seemed iuolined to follow his ex ample, which would not have enited Tom Ripon in the least, so be oried out, \" The first man that moves, I send a couple of bullets into bis nob!\" \"There's one for your nob, my fine fellow I\" cried a voice; and the gentlemen who bad got out of the coach fired a pistol right through it, from one door to the other, at Tom. The bullet passed so close to the Quaker's nose that it positively singed the end of it, and it struck Tom's hat from his head. \" Oh, two can play at that game!\" cried Tom. Bang ! went his pistol as he spoke. The unfortunate Quaker had not recovered from tte fright of the first bullet, when that from Tom Ripon's pistol passed him a. close as the other had done- That was too much for his endurance, and with a yell of dismay, he slipped ofl the seat to the floor of the coich, dragging with him the lady who had clutchtd him by the throat \"Your money or your lives!\" shouted Tom, \" Am I t. be kept here all night !\" Tom did not know if tho pistol shot be bad re turned bad produced any effect or not, but the mail coach was full of smoke, and all that we have desoribed had happened in very much less time than it has taken us te tell it The two leaders then swerved to the left\u2014 that was the side ou which Tom Ripon wa9 waiting. They had to mr.ke a rush past the cart in the road- One of them fell. That drugged down tbe other. A scene of great confusion immediately ensued. The coachman was afraid to jump down, or he would have done so The guard forgot all his fears of highwaymen in the pret-ent difficulty, and the outside passengers became in a state of great excitement, expecting every moment that the coach would upset and \"spread\" them, as the term wa\u00bb, in all directions. Female screams came from the inside, which was pleasant to Tom to hear, for it let him know that he would probably have an easy prey when he should dart forward on his erra-d of ptuuder. Tbe guard got off the roof, leaving his blunder buss behind him, which certainly was of no use iu trying to get two horses on their legs again. \" Hold hard, Jem !\" he said to the coachman ; \"bold 'em in ! hold 'em in !\" \" I am I\" said the coachman ; \" but they kick like blazes?\" \" Never mind that\" \" Oh, it's all very well to say never mind that ! A fellow's arms ain't iron bars 1\" \" What's tho matter, eh?\" That was a voice from the inside. One purse was handed to Tom It was from one of the gentlemen, who said, \" Go away ! go away! Goodness gracious! go away, do, my man !\" \" Only an oss down, roy lord !\"' said the gnatd. \"Pick him up \u2014 I imist upon your picking him up and going on !\" \" Yes, my lord '.\" \"Yea, friend,\" said another voicn from the in side, \u2014 \" yea, I will not pay thee tby fare, for tbou did6t contract to carry, convey, and dispose of me to Oxford, and not to stop on the road to pick up or to throw down horses.\" Tom guessed that this was tbo personage who bad beeu addressed as my lord by tho guard, and he said at once, \" No, my lord, this is too light a purse from a nobleman ; and I am sorry to say that I mnst blow out your noble brains, or bave more ! \" Good gr\u00bbcious !\" \" That's him ! Down upon him ! Seize him ! Now for it! There be is!\" \" I shall faint!\" cried a female voice \" Don't, ma'am,\" said a mau. \" But if you do, I know how to recover you.\" \"How, yon brute?\" \" Why, ma'am, all you have to do is to bold your bead for eight minutes in a dttcli !\" \" Yah ! you mon9ter !\" It was at this moment that Tom Ripon touched his horses' flanks with the spurs, and dash- d for ward out of tbe gloom towards the side of the mail coach. These cries induced Tom to look hastily round and he saw coming along the road some half dozen horsemen at a rapid pace. They came from London, as it appeared, and Tom was not so foolhardy as not to see that the game was up wilh him at present, and that he would be lucky if be got off clear with tbe one puree that had been banded to him \" Off and away 1\" cried Tom. He touched his horse wilh tbe left spur, and it \" Keep back, comrades !\" shouted Tom, to an"], [325, "EDITO ITERON. 319 was well that he did eo, for it made the creatuie rear, asd the same instant the voice of the guard cried out, \" Pepper for one!\" With a tremendous report the b'underbuss went off, and Ihe whole cements flew past ihe head and face of Tom Ripon like a shower of hail, but without doing him the least injury in the world. a horse past any oVj ct that frightened him, w..d he proceeded to put it into instant execution. It was simply to (.ut a haud over each if l!ie horse's eyes, aud then urge him forward with knee aud spur. Yes, it succeeded. Ou went the bor&o. But at what a pace? A s< it of jig-trot, of about seven miles au hour, while the pur.uers were on the gallop. The horse passed so close to the fiLger-post tbat be bustled against if. That gave Tom au idea. He stretched up bis arms and gra>rj+-d the finger post, drawing himself up to it out _- tbe sad_le as ihe hoiso parsed. \"Good-bye!\" said Tom. At the morneot one of the mounted men who were in pursuit fiied a pistol. Tho ball grazed the neck of tbe horse. Indeed, any one who had 6een the transaction might bave beeu excused for supposing that the most tfl-ctive portion of Ihe charge of the blnndc-r bnss had come out at the butt- end ; for, while no effect was produced upon Tom Ripon, the guard went right bead over he. Is into the roadway. The recoil of the overloaded weapon had been much more mischievous than is discharge. Tom Ripon was scared for the moment at this shower of missiles in such close proximity to his head, and his horse was more fiigh'.ened than bo. With a vaulting leap lhat very nearly had the effect of dislodging Tom from tho saddle, the horse made a distance of at least twelve feet fiom the Oxford mail. If Tom had sliil been on its back, that bullet would have passtd through him from back to breast Then, with shouts and cries, the horsemen who were tearing alorg the road to the rescue of te coach, which they thought, seeing the amount of confusion, aud hearing ibo firing, was surely beset by a baud of robbers, came on, and Toai felt that it was low a riiC9 for lile. The horse uttered one of those stranpe cries of pain which are so appalling on a battle-field, aud then off it set at a pace to which its former gallop was nothing lo te compared. Tom was astride ihe Auger- pott The clouds covertd over the moon again, All was dark. M On ! on I1' he ciied to tbe horse. H Ob, that it waa my old friend Daisy who was carrying me to-night !\" Had it been Daisy that Tom Rf^on bestrode on this occasion, he would have laughed to scorn the pursuit that was being made ot him ; but, as it was, he hardly knew what amount cf speed the horse he rode was capable of Tom hoped that the creature was now suffi ciently fctar tied to start off at a gallop, which, akhuugh it might partake of a downright \" bolt,\" Tom had little fear of on a long, level ioa-l. So long as he fihuuld keep his seat, and there was no particular re. eon why he bhould not, all would be well enough, and the horse would stop when he had Lad eu> ugh of it. Tbat was Tom's hope and calculation ; but it turned out fallacious. \"A p'ague take you !\" eaid Tom Ripon apostro phizing the bone, as Le saw it rapidly disappear down the road \u2014 \"a plague tike you ! Jf yon had gone as f^st as that when 1 wanted you, i should not be here holding on t_> the fijoger-poit.\" Tho n_oi_nttd men who wero in pursuit of the highwayman tore past the finger-^ost at fceadloDg speed- They did Lot tuspeet tbat it was a horee without a rirer they were pursuing with so much vigour and determination. \"Good n'ght to you all,\" said Tom, \" and tbe deuce go Tvilh jou! A pretty mess I am in now! It's more than ti^ht iniles to Epping Firest, and I have lost my horse. I wonder what is in tho purse?\" Tom weighed tbe purae with one hand, while he held on to the finger-post with tbe otber. Tbe purse was a handsome one, and certainly heavy, but Tom shook his beii as he lAt from the outside that the money wts loo largo lo be gold- \" Done again V said Tom ; \" UV only haH-crowra if it ain't halfpence, aud I nave lost a good horse and a pair of good pistols. That don't pay ! I wonder what the Captain will say now 1\" Tom then wocdeied what that young girl would siy, who had made such sport of him at tbe forest only a few short hours before. Tbat last reflection was more annoying to Tom than the previous one. The hoise was quite scared enough to be full of the wish to \" bolt ;\" but he was, as nell, full of the spirits to take fright afresb, and in some new way, at everything he 6aw. Past the post-house he went at beadloDg speed, aud the distance between Tom and bis pursuers was rapidly increasing. But then, as ill fortune would hove it, a gap in tbe mass of clouds that bad for all the eveuiig as yet obscured the moon thowed itself, and just before the horse's eyes the sieger- post that had directed Tom the right road to take to meet the Oxford mail rose up in'i light and observation, with all the staitling effect as if it had suddenly come- out of the earth. The horse reared on his hind-feet instantly. \" Well, I can't help it. One can't be always lucky ; and the very bett thing I can do now is to get down, and make my way over Ihe iieIJs to Epping. Oh, somebody is cemitg ! Who is it, I wonder?\" Two horsemen came at a quiet pace down the road, aud halted not half a d. z?u paces from the finger-post on which Tom Eipon had taken re fuge. _ Both these horsemen wore slouched hats, and oloaks, the collars of whioli came high np to their facts, and it was evident that the sutj.ct of their conversation was deeply interesting. \" On! on!'* cried Tom. The horse would not pass the finger-post. \" Forward !'' cried Tom. He pluogid the spurs rowel deep in the horse's flanks, but the creature would not move, but kept pawing the air with its fore-feet, and looking at the fit'ger-post. \" That's a settler I\" said Tom. \" They will be up to me in another minute, and then I'm grabbed and nabbed I\" Tom then thought of a plan he had heard Ogle speak of \u2014 that, in nine cases out of ten, would get"], [326, "320 EDITH HERON. no hesitation in making the arrangements with you that you propose.\" \" It is always well, my Lord Warringdale,\" said Wild, \" to feel no hesitation in dealing with a mar like me. People who hesitate under such circum stances generally do so to their own detriment.\" \" I believe it,\" sighed Warringdale. \" Well,\" added Wild, in his usual brutal tones \u2014 \" well, a bargain is a bargain ; and this is ours. You are to have not only no opposition, but every possible assistance from me in getting possession of the title of Earl of Whitcombe, while I am to have the estates ?\" CHAPTER GXXII. TOM RIPON FALI.S AOAIN INTO THI HANDS OF HIS OLD ENEMY, JONATHAN WILD. Tom Rii-on, situated as he was on the finger post, could not fail to hear every word whish was spoken by the two mysterious horsemen. The voices were muffled to a certain extent, by the manner in which the cloak collars were drawn up over the eyes almost of these men ; but Tom Ripon had young and sharp ears, and he almost fell off the finger-post at the sound of the voice of the first speaker- It was a voice he knew well- Too well, by far, for bis peace of mind on the present occasion. It was the voice of Lord Warringdale, the in famous and unscrupulous half-brother of Felix Heron. \" Be it so, then,\" he said. \"I feel with you that nothing can be done while such an encumbrance exists. Both Edith and her child must be dis posed of, and then I am as certain as tbat we are two living men at this moment, that Felix Heron will no longer trouble us, or any one else, with his claims to the title and estates of Whitcombe.\" \" You rascal I\" thought Tom Ripon ; \" you would dispose of the Lady Edith and the child, would you ? There will go two words to that bar gain, I think ; but I must listen to what the other rascal has to say about it.\" The other rascal, as Tom Ripon very properly called him, had not yet spoken ; but when he did, if Tom had felt inclined to fall ofi the finger-post at the sound of Lord Warringdale's voice, be was much more inclined to do so at the sound of that which then came upon his ears. \"Yes, yes!\" \"Ha, ha!\" \"You laugh?\" \" I do. I laugh at you. I have the substance, and you the shadow \" \" It is your own condition.\" \" It is. But yet I cannot help laughing a little, although I am free to own that I should have liked to get a coronet on this old battered skull of mine, before it goes to the worms, if only to make the world stare.\" \" You are childles?, Mr. Wild, and so the peerage would be but of little good to you.\" \"Who told you that?\" Wild spoke with a ferocity of tone and manner that made Lord Warringdale put up his arm in stinctively, as though he expected to be struck. \" No one told it me ; only, as I never heard that yon bad any family, I assumed it as a fact.\" \" Don't assume it any more, then ; and as far as regards that, I never heard that yoH, my Lord Warringdale, had found a mate, even though you were thought to be heir-at-law to an earldom.\" \" Not yet.\" \"Ha, ha! Not yet 1\" \" And yet, Mr. Wild, with you I wish to be perfectly frank ; and so can and will explain to you how and why it is I can afford to take as my share of the compact between us what you are pleased to call the shadow, while you have tho substance.\" \" That is my identical proposition 1\" said the second horseman. There was no such thing as for one half-second mistaking those tones, which grated on the ears like the setting of a saw. \"Jonathan Wild!\" gasped Tom Ripon. From that moment Tom's interest in what was \u2022aid by those two villains became doubly acute. A great terror came over him, but still he lis tened with all the power he possessed. Little did Wild, with all his cunning, which had the appearance sometimes of being something preternatural, imagine that such a listener was close at hand, as he spoke freely to Warring dale. \" Well ?\" \"In the first place, as a peer of the realm, and member of the House of Lords, some piece of Court preferment, that shall bring with it large and welcome emoluments, will easily fall into my grasp.\" \" Granted.\" \" In the next place, I shall be able to make some matrimonial alliauce, the conditions of which will be that I barter the title of Countess for wealth.\" \" Ah, I see I \u2014 some greasy citizen's daughter, with his till full of gold/' \" Exactly.\" \" Be it so. If you are content, why, so am I ; and I pledge my word to you that I will find a means of getting possession of Edith, and of tie child of Heron. The only terms, then, on which he shall evor see them again in life will be the admission of his illegitimacy and your just claims to the title.\" It would seem that these two men had patched up a kind of peace together, and that they now thought it worth while to work together for their mutual benefit. The knowledge they bad of eachotber's rascality could not be more complete than it was, so that they had nothing to le.rn about the mode of act on which each was likely to pursue ; and yet hey felt at this time the policy of holding together nd working for a common interest- It was Warringdale who now took up the thread of the conversation. \" Do that, Jonothan, and all will be well. All our former little misunderstandings will fade away, and be forgotten, and there is no reason why we should not be the best of friends \" \" We shall ! Ha, ha ! Dead friends are fast friends \u2014 fast in the grave!\" ' Good heavens I What do you mean?\" \" I mean that I don't think I shall live to be a hundred years old, that is all ; and that as you are by twenty-five years or thereabouts the younger man of the two, you will, in all human probability, \" Mr. Wild,\" he said, \" I cannot expoct that you should work for me without at tho same lime having an eye to your own interests.\" Wild laughed. Perhaps it was at the utter absurdity of any one thinking it necessary to make such a remark as lhat which had just como from the lips of Lord Warringdale. \" Aud, therefore,\" added Warringdale, \" I feol"], [327, "EDITH HERON. 321 lave to go *ato mourning for your old friend Jonathan Wild. Ah, what's that ?\" \"Only the moon!\" \" How bright ?\" \" It is, indeed. What a clear rift in the clouds ! It seems as if one could see two thousand miles into space.\" dow that it threw upon the roadway was at sharply defined as the edge of a sword. And mingling with that shadow was likewise a correct outline of Tom Ripon. It was a perfect picture of him, as he clung to the cross top-lines of the finger-post Jonathan Wild looked at this shadow with amazement. \" I am lost I\" thought Tom Ripon. The rift in the clouds, into which Lord War ringdale fancied he saw two thousand miles into space, when in reality he probably saw millions of times that distance, most provokingly took place exactly at the part of the heavens where the moon had its position. The consequence was that the whole of the spot of earth on which Wild and Lord Warring dale had held their villanous conference was as light as day. The finger-post to whioh Tom Ripon held wjs east into bold and clear relief, and the long sha- For the space of about six seconds Wild seemed for once in his life to be taken so much by surprise as to be incapable of action or thought. Then, with a sharp exclamation, he looked up at the finger-post, and drawing a pistol from his saddle, he pulled the trigger. The pistol flashed in the pan. Had it fairly exploded, poor Tom Ripon would there and then have ended his career. \" Ah ! A spy I \" cried Lord Warringdale. Jonathan Wild, in his anger, flung the pistol with such force at Tom Ripon, that it struck the Ko. 41.\u2014 Edith"], [328, "EDITH HERON. 322 \" Tom Bipon, will you save your life, and act with us in regard to Felix Heron.\" \" Yes,\" said Tom. Now Tom no more knew wtsat he was saying yes to, than at that moment be knew exactly the composition and geography of that moon whose Sliver beams had shone down upon the earth so inopportunely for him. All he heard was, that he was to act in some manner In regard to Felix Heron, and the idea that that manner could possi- bly be other than for his interest and in good faith to him, never having found \u00ab home in Tom's brains, it did not reach it amid the confusion and perplexity that belonged to him on the present in- auspicious occasion. \" Very well,\" said Wild, \" if that is to be tbe little game, I have no objection in life. I have always a bullet and a cord ready if either of them are wanted. Come on I\" Wild stooped from his horse, and took hold of Tom Ripon by the oollar, and tried to lift him to the saddle behind him, but that was a feat he could not have accomplished without tbe assistance of WarringdaU. Between them, however, it was done, anu Jonathan, without releasing Tom from the cord, tied the loose end several times round his owf waist. \"Come on, my lord I\" he cried; \"to London. Tom was recovering his senses. As Wild's horse, which was a wiry and power ful hackney, started into a fast trot, he uttered a loud cry. \" Confound you I\" said Wild i \" it will be time enough to kick up a fuss when the cart at Tyburn is wheeling away, and you are about to have a dance upon nothing.\" \"Halt! stop! help! murder!\" Tom had no idea, now that he was fast recover ing bis voice and his senses, of being carried off by Jonathan Wild in peace. His cries reached the post-house. There were loud shouts, and a trampling of horses' feet, and as Wild had no desire to be raced to London, be drew rein and shouted out, \" Who wants {to speak to me?\" Several men en horseback galloped up, and by the moonlight one of them looked at Tom Ripon and exclaimed, \" Why, this is the highwayman who stopped the Oxford mail !\" \" Ye\u00bb,\" said another, \" I will affirm that this is the individual; and yea, verily, perchance, this man, who is but ill-favoured, is one of those accomplices that he called unto not to fire upon us!\" wooden cross-piece of the finger-post to which he was holding, a rap that made his hand and arm feel as if stung by a serpent. Tom at once dropped to the ground. \"Good night, Johnny!\" he cried. Stooping low, Tom Ripon made n dart to the side of thi \u00ab\u00bbd, intending to make a scramble of it through the hedgerow, and take to the fields before either Jonathan Wild or Lord Warring- dale could lay hold of him. But that was not to be. Tom's lucky star certainly ivas not in the as- cendant, along with that bright and beautiful, but most inopportune, moonlight Something caught him round the shoulders and one arm. He knew not what it was, bnt it brought him suddenly to the ground, where he lay half stunned by the suddenness of tbe fall. \"Good I\" said Wild; \"it was money well spent\" \"What?\" cried Warringdale. \" Tbe guinea I gave to that South American fellow Jones, wbo exhibits in the Haymarket, and who taught me how to cast what they call the lasso.\" Lord Warringdale almost flung himself now from his borse, iu his eagerness to see who it was that had been a listener to the conversation between himself and Wild. \" Who is the spy ?\" he cried. \" Pick him np ?\" said WUd ; \" I know him.\" \"Who? who?\" \" His name is Tom Ripon. I have had my eye upon him. His name is in my book at page twenty \u2014 booked for Tyburn. Pick him up.\" Lord Warringdale dragged Tom Ripon to bis feet, and he seemed not a little surprised at the singularity of Tom's costume. Tom peemed all coat. Now that he was on foot, the scarlet coat of Felix Heron touched with its skirts the ground, and gave Tom an irresistibly comic aspect. The rope with the running noose at tbe end of it, which Jonathan Wild had had the good fortune rather than the good skill to cast over Tom's head, still clung tightly to him, and was far from feeling pleasant. The sudden fall on the road made a bump on Tom's head, which, from the size of a nut, was fast increasing to that of an egg. No wonder he felt rather oonfused. Jonathan Wild took the other pistol from his pocket, and deliberately pat it on full cock. \"Hold him 1\" Lord Warringdale let go Tom in alarm. \"Do you mean to kill him, Mr. Wild ?\" \" On second thoughts, yes \u2014 it is better.\" \" No ! no ! And yet he may be dangerous.\" \" He is all danger. Hold him by the coat, and I will put a bullet into his brain.\" Perhaps, Tom Ripon was never quite so near death as at that moment but all he felt was a sense of confusion and horror of Jonathan Wild and Lord Warringdale. \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" that's it !\" \" Then you are my prisoner !\" said a stout burly looking man in white sleeves and an apron, wbo had come from the post-house with a constable's staff in his hand. Wild looked at this man with a glance of tbe most ineffable contempt as be laid hold of his bridle arm. \" My friend,\" said Wild, \" do you feel quite well ?\" \" One moment,\" said Warringdale : \" tell me really and truly who he is ?\" \" A boy who lives and swears by Felix Heron.\" \" Ah ! indeed.\" \"Yes, I do.\" \" Ah ! oh ! Well, you are really very bad !\" \"Am I?\" \" You are ; but if you take your hand off my arm, you may possibly recover.\" \" Who are you that speaks so bounoeable?\" \"Who am I?\" \" Yes. Now you don't object ?\" \" No. But \u2014 but if he be in the confidence of Felix Heron, don't yon see,\" said Wild, \"how nunch good service he might do for us.\" \" Ay, if he would.\" \" Yes, who are you, ugly ?\" \" My lord, will you tell this poor man who I am \" Try him.\" if you please.1"], [329, "EDITH HERO 323 At this title of my lord, which in England is so idolized, at the same time that it is so well known how accidental is its possession the whole party turned their eyes to Warringdale, who said care lessly, \" That is Mr. Jonathan Wild.\" If Jonathan Wild's arm, which the constable had hold of, had suddenly turned red-hot, he could not have let it drop with more precipi tancy than he now did. Without another word he fled back to the post-house. \"Yes,\" said Wild, \"that is my name, and this is my prisoner. If any of you have a charge to make against him, all you must do is to come to my house in London, and it will be gone into. Gentlemen all, good night.\" With one of his most hideous grimaces, Wild slightly touched the rim of his hat and then giving his horse the spurs, he went off at a good round trot, but one that was anything but agree able to Tom Bipon, who was awkwardly enough situated at the back of the saddle. \" Of what ? Oh, of what ? Did anybody say anything of my son Tom ?\" screamed Mrs. Bipon, at that moment reaching the spot. \"Hush!\" \" I won't bush ! Goodness gracious \u2014 marrow bones and cleavers! What has happened?\" \" Yea, as the psalmist says, what is amiss ?\" asked the Reverend Mortification, who bent bis long body right over Mrs. Ripon's head. \" It is a case of here to-day and gone to-morrow, with my son-in-law. Yea, and amen !\" \" Take that !\" \"Oh!\" Mrs. Ripon faced about upon the Reverend Mortification, dealt him such a blow in the region of the stomach, with a flat-iron that she had caught up, and sallied out of the ruins with on ber first alarm, that he was completely doubled up, and sat down at once iu a bush of wild briar. \" What is the meaning of the notes of alarm ?\" said Felix Heron, quietly, as at this moment he made his appearance ou the spot. \" Ob, Captain, we are afraid that some accident has happened to Tom Eipon. A horse on which it appears he went from the forest, has found bis way back without him.\" \" Tom Ripon went from the forest, you say ? . \" Yes, Captain, and it seems he said, or thought, tbat he bad your permission.\" \" Impossible !\" \" So I thought, Captain ! But here is the horse, and here is no Tom Ripon.\" As the news spread from one to tbe other of the party, tbat some misadventure had befallen Tom Ripon, the greatest possible interest was awakened in the old forest. CHAPTER CXXIII. AN ALARM AT THE FOREST. \u2014 THE HORSE WITH- OUT A RIDER. It was about the grey dawn of early morning that a dark bay horse without a rider, and with the stirrups flapping aud dashing against its flanks, made its way into Epping Forest. The scouts that had come on duty at sun- light heard the tramp of the steed on the soft herbage. Dimly they saw it, too, as it took its way along one of the most open of the old glades. The horse knew its way well, and it paused not until it came to one of those narrow and in- tricate openings among tbe dense brushwood, with which Epping abounded, and which led to the stables tbat were so completely hidden from all human observation. Some half-dozen of the band began at once to hazard opinions on the subject of Tom's dis appearance, but Captain Heron silenced all the vociferous councillors by a wave of the hand, a3 he said, \" Ogle, to you I commit the task of un ravelling this mystery. Do so as quickly as you can, for I would not put the loss of Tom Ripon in competition with the best member of my baud, and in saying that, I seek to disparage no one.\" As Felix Heron uttered these words, he walked slowly away from the spot ; but he was followed by Mrs. Ripon, who grasped him by tbe sleeve of his coat, and, in half-choked accents, she spoke to him imploringly. It was Ogle who started forward with suspense on bearing the sound of tbe horse's steps, and the animal, at sight of him, suffered itself at once to be caught by the rein, which was hanging loosely by its neck. \" Hilloa !\" cried Ogle. \" Here has been some thing amiss. Whose horse is this that finds its way so handily to the recesses of the forest, and yet has no rider?\" \" He is lost ! \" said a voice. \" Oh, Captain ! \u2014 oh, do not, for the love of mercy, let my Tom be hanged!\" \" Hanged, Mrs. Ripon ? What for ?\" \" I don't know \u2014 dear me ! I don't know ; but last night I dreamt of a black cat, and it had a face like my poor boy, and it kept jumping over me, and crying ont, ' Dnst to dust ! \u2014 ashes to ashes !' \" The voice then at once merged into a flood of tears, and the young girl who had so offended Tom's dignity on his departure from the forest, at once stepped up to Ogle, and clasping her hands, spoke as well as she could for emotion. \" It is Tom Ripon's horse.\" \" Tom Ripon's ?\" \" Yes. He said he had the leave of the Captain to go forth on tbe road. He went on this borse which has returned ; but oh ! where is he ?\" Ogle looked astonished. He took from his pocket a silver whistle, and blew it four times distinctly, making a pause of a few seconds between each. \" The Captain is abroad in the wood,\" said Ogle, \" for I have seen him already this morning, and the sooner he knows of this the better.\" Heron, in the midst of all his anxiety about Tom, oould not forbear a smile, but be at tbe same time spoke as consolingly to Mrs. Bipon as he could. \" Be of good oheer ; I would wager my life tbat Ogle brings some tidings of him shortly, and be assured that you shall know then.\" With this, Mrs. Ripon was fain to be satisfied, and she turned back to the spot where she had left Ogle, in order to impress upon him the necessity, as she expressed it, of leaving no stone unturned in search of Tom. But luckily for Ogle, Mrs. Ripon was not in"], [330, "324 EDITH HERON, time so to torment him, and all she saw of him was a figure on horseback rapidly making his way out of the forest among the trees. Ogle's experience while with Jonathan Wild, and his still further experience while a member of Captain Felix Heron's band, had bestowed upon him a tact and skill in ferreting out any mystery that was second to no man's Without tbe least pause, Ogle rode two miles ont of the wood to a little road-side inn named the \" Falcon.\" \" Exactly. Good merning.\" \" Stop ! you haven't heard it all, sir. We know that the highwayman was bio wed all to bits, be cause his horse, without him, came by here at a sharp trot.\" \" His horse ! A brown\u2014 a dark kind of half bay, half brown?\" \"The very creature, sir ! \" \" From which direotion did the horse come, my friend ?\" \"That way, sir; and I thick Well, now, that's cool ! What an odd sort of a man ! Ho flings down a shilling, and off he goes, without so much as a good morning ! He's a real gentle man, though, for he has gone off without his change !\" Ogle galloped a mile. He came to a cross-road by the side of which was a tramp boiling a kettle on some loose lighted sticks. \" Hilloa ! \" cried Ogle ; \" will you earn a crown?\" At the door of that he drew rein, and called aloud for a glass of old ale. The landlord himself came bustling out with it, and as Ogle emptied the measure, he looked over the brim at the landlord, and saw that he was just one of those communicative persons who are never so happy as when they have something out of the common to say. \"Bless you, sir !\" he said ; \"perhaps you haven't heard the news ?\" \" Is it murder ?\" \" News! \u2014 what news ?\" \" No, no !\" \" Then what do you offer so much for?\" Ogle laughed, as he added, \" I only want some information, which, perhaps, you can give me, and would have given me for nothing ; yet I t\u00bb\u00bbH give you tbe crown, if you will tell me tho most curious thing you know of, in the last twelve hours, that has happened in this neighbourhood.\" The tramp nodded. \" I know what you want to know,\" he said. \" I can tell you that Jonathan Wild has been ont and about here to-night or last nuht \u2014 I ought to say, now, along with some one I didn't know, but who looked like as great a rogue as himself.\" \" Go on !\" \" What news, sir ! Wonderful news, in a way of speaking ! The Oxford mail, do you know, sir, was stopped by a complete band of highwaymen !\" \" Ay, indeed!\" \" Yes, sir. A terrible band !\" \" When was that ?\" \" Why, sir, last night as ever was. It waa a dim sort of night.\" \" How many highwaymen were there?\" \" Why, you see, sir, Joe, the guard, can only swear tbat he saw one.\" \" Oh 1\" \" But that one spoke to the others behind the hedges, you see, sir ; and that was how Joe came to know there was such a band of them, you see.\" \"Yes, I see! A very sensible conclusion of Joe's, indeed !\" \" Ah, you want to know more ! Where is the crown, master?\" \" There !\" cried Ogle, as he pitched a crown piece to the tramp, who dexterously caught it, and secreted it among his rags with n speed and dexterity that was quite professional. Then he said, \" I can toll you that Mr. Wild made a prisoner !\" Ogle nodded. \" Oh, you know that ?\" \" I guessed it ; but I wanted to be quite sure of it. What sort of prisoner was it?\" \" A sort of a boy, with a man's coat on\u2014 a scarlet coat!\" \" Oh, yes, sir, Joe is a 'cute fellow, he is ! Per haps you would like another measure of ale ?\" \" With all my heart.\" The landlord ran into the house and filled the measure. The ale was good, so that Ogle did no violence to his feelings by drinking it ; and the more especially was he inclined to do so, because he suspected he was on the right scent after Tom Ripon. \" Well, landlord,\" he said, \" what came of that affair of the Oxford mail, after all ?\" \"Oh, Joe settled him!\" \"En?\" \" Yes, that is the person- I thank you, as well as give you the crown freely; and now tell me if, in your judgment, the boy was wounded or not?\" \" Blew him all to bits, sir, with his blunderbuss \u2014 all to atoms 1\" \"No!\" \" Yes, sir ; and what makes Joe sure he did, is that not one of the bits \u2014 not one of the atoms have been found!\" \" I think not.\" \" Good I That will do.\" Ogle turned his horse's head, and at once gal loped back to Epping Forest. He knew now all about what had taken place, almost as well as Tom himself could have told him. Except the little particulars of the night's proceeding, Ogle was able to put together, iu his own mind, almost in the form of a connected narrative, all that happened to Tom Ripon. \" He stopped the Oxford mail, confound his im pudence !\" said Ogle to himself ; \" and after that he fell in with Jonathan Wild, and abandoned his horse to hide somewhere ; but Wild found him out, and made a prisoner of him, and has taken him to London, where he will, first of all, try to get him, from the fear of death, to aid him in his rasoalities ; and, failing that, he will have him put on his trial for the highway ro.bery, and hang him, if he can.\" Ogle drew a long breath of relief, for he had be gan to feel that the misadventure that kept Tom from the forest was a more serious one than had even been imagined. But the disappearance of all the bits and all the atoms of the highwayman convinced Ogle that whether tbat highwayman was Tom Ripon or not, the blunderbuss of Joe, the guard of the Oxford mail, had not done any mischief. \" Well, Mr. Landlord,\" said Ogle, \" so the rascal was got rid of?\" \" Quite, sir, quite ! The blunderbuss, you see, sir, was rather overloaded, so Joe went back wards.\" \"Ah, I comprehend!\" \" And whon ho camg for'ards again, the high- way man was gone."], [331, "EDITH HERON. 325 Ogle was quite right in the main facts, for that was exactly the course Jonathan Wild meant to pursue. acorn,' when he will tell you what I send him to say.\" \"Agreed, Captain; I shall not forget And hero is Daisy.\" \" Remain here a few minutes witii her.\" In another half-hour Ogle was once more be neath the shadows of the tall trees of Epping Forest; but he would give the information he brought to no one but Captain Heron himself. It was heard with profound attention and uneasiness. Heron expressed to Edith the necessity of his absence ; and although it cost her a flood of tears to part with him, she would utter no word to make him stay, for she felt that he went after what he thought a sacred duty. In five minutes more Heron was mounted on Daisy, and picking his way among the trees by the shortest route from the forest on to the Lon don road. \" What is to-day, Ogle?\" \" Thursday, Captain.\" \" And the Old Bailey sessions are on ?\" \" They are !\" \" Then Tom Ripon is doomed, unless we can save him ! Saddle Daisy for London at once, Ogle ; I will try something, even at some personal risk!\" Daisy seemed to be specially delighted to get ont of the wood with her master as a companion ; and as Heron allowed her to take what pace she chose, it was at one which rather astonished other travellers on the road that she made ber way to London. \" He is worth it, Captain.\" \" I know and feel he is. This escapade of his is the height of indiscretion ; but one who is so truly faithful as Tom Ripon, is, like yourself, Ogle, worth everything in all the world !\" Ogle was about to make some reply, when a pigeon flew in a circle over their heads, and then fell to the ground, apparently rather weak in its flight \" Pick up that bird, Ogle,\" cried Heron ; \" it is one of Eiith's pigeons, Iihink.\" Ogle dismounted, and lifted the bird from the green-sward, and as he did so, he almost shonted out, \" It was one of the Lady Edith's pigeons, Captain ; but it is one that she gave to Tom Ripon, and he took it to London with him, to give to a man of the name of Anderson, who is an old schoolmaster, and who was kind to him when he used to live with his mother at the old fence, in Soho.\" Ogle looked after Heron as far as he conld sea him and Daisy among the trees, and then he slowly took his way towards the most hidden in tricacies of the forest But there was a night \u2014 a sense of depression about the heart of Ogle, which he could not alto gether account for by anxiety concerning Tom Ripon, although he certainly was anxious on that score to a considerable degree. Tbe feeling, however, on the mind of Ogle was a presage of some coming danger; and if he bad remarked a circumstance tbat took place a few moments after be had left the spot on which his short conversation with Felix Heron had just taken place, he would have found cause for alarm, as well as for the exercise of all his diligence in the absence of Heron. \" But how comes it here ?\" Slowly, and cautiously and silently, from the thickest portion of a large tree close at hand, a man descended. \" That is more than I can divine, Captain ; bnt only look. There is a meaning in it, for here is a bit of paper round one of the bird's legs.\" Ogle untwisted a piece of very dull coloured paper from the leg of the pigeon, and handed it to Heron, who, with great difficulty, read the follow ing words on it, which, if they were written with ink at all, were produced by the most marvellously bad ink in the world : \u2014 He looked carefully about him with a half- scared expression, and then shook himself, and uttered an imprecation in a low tone. If Felix Heron had known that man was in Epping Forest, he would not have turned his face from its leafy recesses. If Ogle had seen him, he would bave bad a chance of ridding society of one of its pests. If Edith had but set eyes upon him, and heard his voice, she would have felt pangs of alarm and grief. The man was no other than John Tarleton, the unworthy brother of one of the best and gentlest of human beings. \"Hem!\" he said; \"a nice night, truly, I have spent of it in this tree, that I believe is infested with all the hideous and abominable beetles and crawling things in the forest! Ugh! I can feel them down my back. How can anybody like trees and gardens, and all that sort of thing ? Dgh !\" The thoroughly town-bred and town-vitiated John Tarleton shook himself with a look of dis gust, and seemed as if he would have been glad to escape from his clothes altogether, if that could only have been possible. \" Well,\" he added, \" if there are half a dozen hideous reptiles crawling about me, I suppose I must put up with them, for money I must have, and who in all the world am I to get it from, but from Edith ?\" \" ' To the Captain. Nabbed by Johnny. All's right. Don't tell the old gal. Scragged next Monday, and no mistake. Look sharp after Edith and the kinchin.' \" \" That's from Tom,\" cried Ogle. \" What can I think of it ?\" \"It's a caution, Captain. You and I both ought not to leave the forest together.\" \" Then, Ogle, I will leave in your charge here the better part of my life, my Edith and my child, and I will do my duty as I would do it to any of my followers. I will go alone to London, and see what can be done for Tom Ripon.\" Ogle hesitated a moment, for he wanted to propose that he should go to London and Captain Heron remain at the forest, but he did not like to do so ; and Heron who divined what waa upper most in the mind of his faithful and attached follower, added, \"Fear nothing for me, Ogle; but if I should want your help in town, I will send for it. I will find a messenger, you may depend. And to be sure that there is no mistake, and that there can be no treachery, we will agree now upon some watch-word. My messenger shall say to you here in Epping the words, ' Any corn in the wood ?' and then you shall reply, ' Only au"], [332, "326 EDITH HERON. \" It seems,\" said Tom, \" that I have brought it to Newgate Market !\" \" Ha, ha !\" laughed Wild. \" There is, perhaps, a little more in that remark than yon think, Tom Bipon. First, Newgate Market; and then Tyburn Tree !\" \u25a0 Very good, Johnny !\" Wild took hold of Tom Ripon by the arm, and swung him roughly from the horse; and then, holding him with a grip that was enough to take a piece out of his arm, he led him into the house. \" Hilloa I Hilloa ! Lambskin !\" cried Wild. CHAPTER CXIIY. JONATHAN WILD MAKES HIS PROPOSITIONS AND THREATS IN FULL TO TOM RIFON. T\"M Ripon was nearly shaken to a jelly by the time Jonathan Wild halted with him at the door of his house in Newgate Street But whatever might be the corporeal sufferings of Tom, he had tbat spirit within which was proof against them all. Jonathan Wild quite enjoyed the terrible jolting he gave Tom, but he did not succeed, for all that, in extorting from his victim the slightest expres sion of pain or inconvenience. On the contrary, when Wild did speak to his prisoner, he generally got some reply that was decidedly unpleasant. Jonathan Wild's arrival in London, after the mysterious disappearance of what was thought to be his dead body frora his house in Newgate Street, had oreated quite a feeling of consterna tion and commotion among the fraternity of thieves and thief-takers. \" Here, sir !\" Lambskin was one of Jonathan's new asso- ciates, and a more villanous-looking rascal the snn never shone upon. He came forward with a slonching gait, keeping his eyes towards the floor, and yet peering up out of the corners of them, as if he were intent upon the commission of a murder forthwith. \" Here's a little job for you, Lambskin,\" said Wild, as he flung Tom Ripon violently towards the villanous-looking janissary. Tom was on the alert and well prepared for any violence that might be offered to him ; so he took good care, when he was flung in this manner at Mr. Lambskin, to let his heels and his head precede the rest of him, and Mr. Lambskin re ceived some damage in the encounter. \" I couldn't help it, beauty,\" said Tom ; \" it was all old Johnny's doings.\" Mr. Lambskin's nose was contused, and he bad certainly a black eye. He fought at Tom rather wildly, but Tom managed to elude him by drop ping to the floor; and then running between Mr. Lambskin's legs, like a great dog, he made him fall heavily at full length in the passage, and so close to Jonathan Wild, that he knocked that per sonage down, half-way in the honse and half-way to the door-mat. The idea that he was dead, and that his body had been stolen by the resurrectionists to sell to the doctors, was the commonly received one in regard to the transaction ; and the latter part of ' the theory was by no means extravagant at that ' period, when the surgeons had to resort to all sorts of practices to obtain \" subjects.\" But Jonathan Wild as yet was not a \" subject,\" and be had walked into his own honse, on his re- turn, and uttered a horrible kind of yell in tbe passage, tbat had struck dismay into the hearts of all who heard it- The consequence was that those who had taken possession of the house, made a precipitate retreat and were only too glad to get away with whole bones, and Jonathan was left in undisturbed pos session. Tom was quite delighted. Jonathan Wild took care to avenge himself upon Lambskin, so that that worthy, in the short space of three minutes, reoeived an amount of punishment that he could very well have dis pensed with. \" Bravo !\" cried Tom. \" Go it again, both of you ; I like to see it ! Don't mind me 1\" \" Away with him !\" roared Wild. \" Put him in\u2014 ha, ha !\u2014 No. 10 !\" \" 1 will,\" said Lambskin. It did not take the great thief-taker long, how ever, to gather round him a party of those despe radoes, whom he delighted to nuns bull-dogs, or janissaries, as the humour urged him. In half a day, Jonathan Wild was as well established as ever. It was then that he went to Whitoombe House, having heard that Mr. Boom, no doubt presuming npon his (Wild's) reported death, had taken pos session of it Now, Tom Ripon conld see that the idea of put ting him into No. 10 seemed quite to amuse Wild, and to be comforting to Lambskin ; so that Tom naturally came to the conclusion that No. 10 was not likely to be a place that he should admire. What there happened, nnd how Mr. Boom fell a victim to his own meditated treachery to Captain Heron, tbe reader is already aware. Boom was really dead ! But, with this brief retrospect, we turn at tention to Wild, and his prisoner, Tom Ripon, as they reached Little Newgate, at an early hour in the morning. Jonathan dismounted in the odd and original way which he usually used in getting off his horse. That way consisted in lifting his right leg over the horse's head, and then sliding to the ground, after sitting for a moment or two to look about him. \" Come on, you imp I\" cried Lambskin ; \" I'll soon dispose of you !\" M All right, ngly 1\" said Tom. Lambskin laid hold of Tom by the hair of the head ; and led him along the passage towards that terrible door at the end of it, which led down to the cells beneath Wild's house, and which cer tainly ought to have had over it the infernal in scription \u2014 \"Now, my fine fellow,\" said Wild to Tom; \" how do you feel now ?\" \" Pretty well !\" replied T\u00bb\u00bb- - \"only I can't re tnrn the compliment\" \" What compliment ?\" \" Yon called me a fine fellow, I think ?\" \" Bah ! Bo ! You \u00bbre too sharp to live long, nless you will bring your sharpness to a better i-ct '.Vin you have as yet\" \" Whoever enters here may abandon hope!\" Lambskin pushed Tom down before him into tho darkness, and then he called aloud, \" Jinks ! Jinks, I say ! Bring a lantern here !\" A lantern was brought, and by its faint light Tom saw once more those gloomy regions in whioh so many victims of Wild's cupidity and angry passions had led a wretched existence until relieved by death."], [333, "327 EDITH HERON. Tom kept himself on the alert to find out what special dlsagieeableness there might be attached to No. 10 that made it reserved for him, and he was not long in discovering what it meant \" This way, if you please, yonng gentleman,\" said Mr. Lambskin, with quite a polite air and manner. and Mr. Lambskin immediately disappeared from before his eyes. \" Oh, that's it, is it?\" said Tom. As he spoke, Tom took the lantern from the floor of the earthen passage, on which the janis sary had placed it ; and, holding it np above the level of his eyes, he looked curiously into the cell. A glance was almost sufficient to let Tom Ripon know all about it. \" Oh, thank you !\" said Tom ; \" anywhere, I am sure, with you I couldn't but be pleasant\" Mr. Lambskin langhed. He opened a cell door, and held np the lantern for Tom to see his way in. The floor, contrary to Tom's expectation, was level with the passage on the outside, for he thought it likely enough that the trick that wonld be played upon him was the old one of introducing him to a cell, the floor of which was at a descent, and which, consequently, in the dark, inflicted upon the person who was so unhappy as to be made an inmate of it, a bad fall. All, however, seemed fair in this case- But still Tom was suspicious. \" Is this No. 10, beauty ?\" asked Tom. \" Oh, dear, yes!\" \u25a0 Oh, indeed !\" \" Jump in !\" \" Jump in, you say I Can't I walk in as well ?\" \"Yon might; bnt it's as well to jump in. I don't care, however ; yon can please yourself, you know.\" * I intend to do so.\" The real floor of that cell was a good five feet down from the level of the passage that was common to all the cells ; but on the level of that passage from the door to tbe opposite wall some ropes were stretched, upon whioh straw was laid transversely and lightly, so as to give the appear ance of a flooring, without the substantial reality. It was through these ropes that Mr. Lambskin had slipped. \" Very good !\" said Tom. \"Murder!\" yelled Lambskin. \"How do you feel now, beauty ?\" \"Help! murder!\" \" Take things easy. Good bye !\" Tom dosed the door of the cell, and turned the key in the lock. The cries of Mr. Lambskin were only heard faintly and in a muffled sort of way, as if from afar off. \" What am I to do now ?\" said Tom to himself. True he had avoided No. 10, and he was alone in that passage, and had the keys of not only the cell door-, but, probably, that of the door that led into the passage; but it by no means followed that he should on that account be able to leave Jonathan Wild's house easily. Tom was looking into the cell, and making every possible examination of it ; but he was puzsled, for he could see nothing which made it look at all suspicious ; and yet he felt morally certain that there was something amiss, and that when he should either jnmp in or walk in, he should afford some triumph to Mr. Lambskin. Under these circumstances the most natural notions in tbe world occurred to Tom, and that was that he should like amazingly that Mr. Lamb skin should precede him into No. 10. \" I say,\" began Tom ; \" you don't happen to want six dozen silver spoons, twenty gold watches, and abont fifty pounds weight of gold plate, do yOH?\" \" Eh ?\" Still it was worth the trying, and Tom crept very cautiously up tbe stone steps towards the passage. There was a small, narrow iron grating at the upper portion of the door. Through that Tom could get a view of the pas sage right along to the street door. Yes ; it was as he fully expected. In the hall, on a chair, so placed tbat it allowed him to put his feet on another close to the opposite wall, sat one of Jonathan Wild's men. Escape therefore in that way was clearly out of the question. Tom was at a loss what course to adopt, and as he stood considering, he heard a voice, as from the upper part of the house, call out something, but he could not exactly catch what it was. The voice in the passage, however, replied in lond tones. \" Well, if you don't, just say no, and there's an end to it ; but if you do, I know somebody who knows where to lay hands on the little pareel.\" \" You do ?\" \"I do, beauty!\" \" But \u2014 but \u2014 the\u2014 si \u2014 crib that wonld have to be cracked, to get at that, must be one not easy to get at\u2014 eh?\" \" It isn't a crib ; it's all done. It's swag I talk of ; and I happen to know where it lies.\" \" Ah !\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" Bnt the man did not move. Jonathan Wild, then, was probably in the first floor, and had bawled down some question to the man in the hall, which only required an affirma tive answer. \" Yes.

That will do! You must know, beauty, that there is a kind of a sort of\u2014 a \u2014 place where yon can go into all of a heap \u2014 like that!\" Tom had put Mr. Lambskin completely off his guard, and, with a sudden push, he sent him staggering into No. 10. Mr. Lambskin uttered a yell. To the great surprise, then, of Tom, the straw, which lay so thickly upon the floor of that cell, was tossed up in a violent state of commotion, \" Well,\" said Tom, \" I'll go up and speak to Johnny. That's the only thing to do. Who knows but I may, after all, make some terms with him? He's a desperate old rascal, but he likes bold acts, and I rather think I have just done one.\" Acting on this determination, Tom Ripon at once opened the door, and sallied out into the pas sage, to the intense surprise of the bull-dog on duty. \"Hilloa!\" \"AU right!\" \" By jingo, I don't know that !\" \" But I do. I'm going up-stairs to Mr. Wild.\" Tom flung down the lantern, and darted np tha"], [334, "328 EDITH HERON. stairs, calling out as he did so, \" Mr. Wild ! Mr. Wild ! I quite forgot something I wanted to say to you !\" Jonathan heard the voice, and was out on the lauding in a moment. Tom nodded. \" And,\" added Jonathan, \" it shan't be my fault if you don't do tbe last ! Come this way ! I'm sorry I spoke of putting you into No. 10 1 Come this way, and make your fortune 1\" Wild led the way into a room on the first floor, where he had been enjoying a kind of breakfast, or lunch, whichever he chose to call it, after a manner original to himself. He had placed a chair on a table, and on tbat chair he had a bottle of brandy, some cheese, and some biscuits, and a jug with some milk. Wild's plan was to drink a drop of milk, and then fill up the jug from the brandy bottle ; so that, by degrees, the mixed potation of brandy and milk got to be stronger and stronger, until it was almost all brandy. Tbe attention he paid to the biscuits and the cheese was very slight indeed. The confidence of Jonathan Wild, which was one of the secrets of his great surcess, was never more fully exemplified than at that time in tbe way he seated himself on the table by the chair, leaving Tom Ripon to take what action he might If ever, iu the whole course of his life, Jonathan Wild was thoroughly astonished, it cer tainly was then, at the sight of Tom Ripon at free dom, coming up the stairs. \" Why \u2014 why \u2014 what \u2014 where \u2014 Lambskin ?\" \" On, he's all right, I daresay !\" said Tom, as he reached the landing. \" I wanted to speak to you, so I left him in No. 10.\" \" You left him in No. 10 ?\" \"That's it!\" Jonathan Wild fairly retreated before Tom Ripon, as the latter ascended the stairs ; and it was one of the strangest sights, probably, tbat had ever been seen in Wild's bouse, to observe those two persons \u2014 one the man of many crimes, and the other a mere boy \u2014 facing each other in such a way. Notwithstanding all bis courage, and all the natural daring and carelessness of his character, Tom Ripon could not but feel at the time a certain amount of excitement, for well he knew that his life bung, so to speak, upon a hair. Jonathan Wild had only to get into one of his furious rages, and blow his brains out, or dash him down the stairs by a slashing blow wilh his han ger, and there would be an end of him. It would be easy then for Wild either to com mit the murder, or to justify it Tom then knew all that; and therefore it was that, standing, as he felt he stood, in the shadow of death, perhaps be shook a little; and perhaps, too, the fact imparted a kind of dignity to him, that he had never before in any shape or way exhibited. Certain it is that Jonathan Wild was struck by Tom Ripon's appearance. He did not get into a rage, but slightly paleing in the face, he spoke. \" How came you here ; and are you dead or alive?\" For all he, Wild, knew to tbe contrary, Tom might have some weapon about him with whioh he might make some sudden and deadly attack ; but such a thing did not seem to come into his thoughts. \" Look here ! \" he cried, as he st ruck the table a blow with his fist that made the chair, and tbe brandy bottle, and the milk, and the biscuits, and the cheese all jump and jumble together, \u2014 \"look here, my boy ! It's five guineas a month, and good pickings !\" \" What is ?\" \" My service !\" \"Oh, is its\" \"Yes; and I'm not a man to stand upon trifles, or to look too sharply after those who do me good service ! Is it a bargain ?\" \" What a bargain?\" \" Are you mine, body and soul, as high as heaven, and as deep Well, well \u2014 I don't want to frighten you ! Come, come, my lad ; you are with me now, and you will take your first five guineas in advance, won't you?\" Jonathan Wild made a great rattling of loose coin in his pocket, and looked very hard at Tom Ripon, who stood a few paces from him. \"No!\" said Tom. For all he, Wild, knew \u2014 and be was superstitious euough to have some doubts of the fact \u2014 it might t>e poor Tom Ripon's ghost that be saw before him, close to the top of im stairs, Looking so strange and so serious. CHAPTER CXXV. \" No ?\u2014 _,- ? Yon don't mean it ?\" TOM Rl-PON IS PUT UPON HIS TRIAL, BUT MANAGES TO COMMUNICATE WITH CAPTAIN HERON. \" I do mean it, Jonathan !\" \" Stop \u2014 stop ! The only man I ever gave seven guineas a month to was Blueskin ! Did yon know him ?\" Tom advanced a few paces more towards Jonathan Wild, and looked hard at him, as he replied, \"I am alive enough ; and I don't see what good it can do yon to kill me I\" \" Where ?\u2014 where ? Lambskin?\" Tom laughed and nodded. \" Ah ! \u2014 to be sure \u2014 of course you do ! Well, aa I tell you, I gave him seven guineas a month, and I will give you, who are abont a quarter of his size, the same!\" \u2022' Ah !\" \" Oh, you want to know where he is? To be be sure! I left him in No. 10, you see.\" \" And \u2014 and you mean to tell me, boy, that you \u2014that you got the better of Lambskin ?\" \" Rather !\" Wild contracted his brows, and looked firmly at Tom Ripon, who added, \" No, Mr. Wild ; I don't see why you should feel offended with a fellow for saying no ! I am in the service of Captain Heron. If I am to leave him and come to you, it would only be by betraying him ; and were I to do that, I should be quite as capable of betraying you, in which case I should be rather a bad bargain at any money I\" Jonathan Wild was raising the milk jug to his lips as Tom spoke ; but he set it down again, and glared into the eyes of the boy. \"I'll hang him!\" \" It ain't worth while I He couldn't help it, Johnny ! I am Tom Ripon, you see ; and it ain't every fellow that is a match for me!\" Wild looked at Tom with admiration in his glance. \" I'll tell you what it is, my fine fellow !\" he said; \"yon will either go ont of the world very soon, or yon will live to make a figure in it !\""], [335, "EDITH HERO! 129 Perhaps for the fir.-t time in his life, Wild began to bave some respect for consistency and real honesty of purpose. What to say, for some minutes, he certainly knew not ; and when he did speak, it was quite quietly. \" Will you wait?\" \" To be sure not ; and there's one person, at all events, who knows and feels that I am right!\" \"Who is that?\" abont you and all your thoughts are black as night, and you oan see nothing but blood, aud hear no thing but cries and shouts of vengeance, \u2014 you will do this generous thing, and let me go ! \" Wild turned his back upon Tom Ripon, and then springing from to his feet from the table, he paced the room rapidly, and clutching at the air and muttering to himself as he did so. \" Yes \u2014 \u25a0 at night \u2014 when I can't sleep \u2014 when brandy won't do \u2014 when laudunum won't do \u2014 then I see \u2014 then I hear them ! They come throng ing about me, with their swollen faces, aud the blood upon their lips I They shriek, too, and call me fiend ! Help! help! There \u2014 there is one! Don't you see him, boy? There, by the wall \u2014 there he goes! He was hanged. Off! off! Don't look so ! Your eyes will come out of your head i Help! Oh, help!\" Jonathan Wild fell heavily to the floor. Tom Ripon was alarmed Tom smiled. \"It is Jonathan Wild!\" Jonathan took a deep draught at the jug with the milk and the brandy ; and then he looked at Tom again, as he shook his head, aud said, \" I can't do it \u2014 I don't lay that I don't feel half in clined \u2014 but I can't do it!\" \"Do what?\" * Let you go.\" \"Yes, Mr. Wild, you will let me go. For once, just to have it to think of, at some time when all No. 42 \u2014Edith."], [336, "330 EDITH HERON. I A ferocious mood seemed now to have come over Wild, and Tom Ripon hardly thought it worth while to try to contend with it A coach was soon at the door, and Tom and Wild went inside, while one of the janissaries sat on the roof. Well he might be, for never before had he had \u25a0 ''e opportunity of being a witness to suoh an ex hibition of the pangs of conscience It would have been quite easy for Tom Ripon to bave then taken the life of Jonathan Wild, as he lay so helpless on the floor before him, but suoh a tiling never oameinto the mind of Tom. Wild was perfectly safe. No one came near. Either the few brief ories that Wild uttered had not been heard, or those of his bull-dogs and emis saries who did hear them were used to them, and did not think it worth while to interfere. Whatever was the fact, certain it is tbat Tom Ripon was left alone with the great thief-taker, who was completely at his meroy. Tom took np the brandy bottle, and poured some of its oontenta on to the lips of Wild. A good drop went into his mouth. \" That,\" said Tom, oomposedly, \" will ohoke or cure, I feel certain.\" It seemed as if it was much more likely to do the former than the latter, to judge from the look of Wild's face, whioh turned first red and then blue. He kicked convulsively, and made an odd noise in his throat. Tom was taken pro forma before the magistrate, and, upon the statement of Wild, committed for trial I The grand jury were sitting ; and by half past twelve o'clock, Tom Ripon found himself in a oell of Newgate, waiting his trial for highway robbery. Jonathan Wild, aided by the then mode of ad ministering the law, made short work of his vio tims. The evidence which then sufficed to shuffle a fellow-OT Sl-ture out of the world, was very slender in comparison to that whioh is so carefully sifted and looked at how. To be sure, the law required tbat some one should state, on oath, that he or she was robbed, and at the same time should swear to the prisoner as the thief. Tbat done, it was a speedy cos demnation, and a short time to prepare for He, t*- All this Tom Bipon knew perfectly well uut. his reflections in the oell at Newgate were not \u00ab___ tbe most favourable or pleasant character. It was about one o'clock in the day that the cell door opened, and Jonathan Wild stalked ir . and closing it behind him, folded his arms, *uC look ed at Tom. \" So,\" he said, \" yon think you have <5ono it now?\" \" I think it's a settler,\" said Tom ; \"and I shall be able to say that I did the business for Jonathan Wild with the best intentions.\" But Tom was mistaken. Wild managed to get a gasp or two of breath, ind then tie sat up and rapidly recovered. \"What's the matter?\" \" You know best,\" said Tom. \" I rather think you saw the ghost of some poor devil you had sent to Tyburn when you oughtn't.\" Wild pressed both his bands over his eyes, and iu a few seconds a recollection of the past came back to him, and when he looked at Tom again he knew exactly their relative positions. \" Go,\" he said. \" I give yon leave, on one con dition.\" \" Done what ?\" \"Ha, ha! The pigeon!\" Tom was silent for he knew perfectly well what Jonathan Wild alluded to. It was this. While at the magistrate's office, Tom had beer, put Into a cell along with a man wbo bad beer, a neighbour of his mother's, when she kept ho.-o in London, and to whom Tom had, on one of bis visits to the metropolis, given a pigeon that Edith had given to him (Tom), from several she had tamed in Epping Forest. The recognition between Tom and this ma t was mutual and immediate. \"What are you here for?\" \"And what you?\" were the questions rapidly asked on both sides. Tom's old acquaintance was at tbe police-office for some trivial assault, which a fine of tweuty shillings would be sure to satisfy ; but Tom's was a very different affair. It was then that the idea struck Tom that the pigeon he had given to this man would, if let loose, fly back to Epping Forest, and would so be the means of conveying to Captain Heron a message from him. \"What is it?\" \" That yon send to me that long tangle of a fellow, Mortification, who calls himself your father-in-law.\" \" What for ?\" \" To hang.\" \" I won't, then.\"! \" Why,\" oried Wild, \" yon are not his man, are yon ? What has he done, that you should care half a jot whether he is hanged or not? The fellow has foiled me, and I must and will hang him. All yon have to do, Tom Ripon, is to get him to town on some excuse, for I know well be is in Epping Forest, along with Captain Heron \u2014 and then you may go quite free yourself.\" \" I won't\" \"Be ware I T h ink again.\" \" It's no use thinking,\" said Tom. \" If I was to think for a month, I tell you, I wouldn't do it ; so there's an end of it\" The affair was settled in the next three minutes, and some soot and water, with a bit us soft stick, did duty for pen and ink. Thus it was that Oaptain Heron \u2014 as the reader is already aware \u2014 received a message from Tom, of as perfect a character as another hundred years would have enabled the electric telegraph to send it \" Then I give you np.\" \"Good-bye!\" \" No, not in that way ; but to Newgate, for rob bing the Oxford mail.\" \" Very well I\" \" The sessions are on. You will be tried to day, found guilty, and hanged on Monday.\" \" I don't think it\" And now we return to that cell in Newgate where Jonathan Wild visited Tom, and, before speaking, regarded him so fixedly. There was, perhaps, after ail, more of real genuine admiration in the look with which Jona than Wild regarded Tom Ripon, than anger. The fact was, that Tom's whole proceedings. since hie capture, had been of a nature to attraot the approbation of Wild, who had a genuine ad- \" My head to yours !\" said Jonathan, as he rang a bell violently ; and when one of his men ap peared, he shouted, \" A coach at once to Mr. Justice Bart's! Here's a young cock who has orowed quite long enough I\""], [337, "ELUTH HERON. 331 miration for what he called pluck, let it be exer cised either for or against him. This was just the quality that Tom Ripon at that moment excelled in, for two reasons. Firstly, he was naturally brave. Secondly, he was too young fully to see the results of his actions. day that Captain Heron, with Daisy, trotted down Bishopsgate Street into the City of London. On the route from Epping Forest, Heron had had ample time to mature and digest a plan of operations. The reader may be quite tnre that it was a bold one, or it wonld not have come from such a quarter, and in its operation and its progress it will be best exhibited. But then he was defiant as ever, and when Jonathan Wild spoke of the pigeon, Tom laughed in his face. Heron, then, rode right through the City to St Martin 's-le-Grand, which was at that time rather a narrow and contracted thoroughfare. On the side opposite to where the General Post Office is now, there were some very ancient inns \u2014 old City houses, with square court-yards, aronnd which ran spacious galleries, acting as corridors to ranges of bed-chambers Some of those old inns still exist in a modernized fashion in the same locality, although the tho roughfare has assnmed so mnch more pretensions an aspect than what it presented when Captain Felix Heron rode down it from Epping Forest Into one of these inn-yards, then, Heron made his way, and as he did he patted Daisy on the neck, and said a few words to her, which put her upon the performance of a trick which he, Heron, had amused himself by teaching her some years before. \"It's a pity,\" said WUd. \" What it ?\" \" To hang you.\" \" Don't do it then, Johnny.\" Wild shook his head, \" I ought to say to you, Tom Bipon, don't do it, for if yon hang on Monday next at Tyburn it is yonr own fault\" \" I don't see that\" \" Bah ! you see it well enough ; or if you don't, you will see it. Join me \u2014 work for me \u2014 live with me \u2014 heart and hand, aid me in whatever I happen to want you, and you are to-morrow ac quitted on your trial for the highway robbery.\" \" No !\" Tom said this \" No !\" with an emphasis that made even Jonathan Wild start back a step ; bnt he quickly recovered, and pointing at Tom, he added, \" Then it is as fixed as fate. Yon hang !\" \" No, I don't\" \"Look here!\" That trick was to feign lameness. Daisy had not forgotten tbe lesson ; and when Heron whispered to her, \" Poor Daisy \u2014 poor lame Daisy !\" she lifted up one foot and limped along, apparently hardly able to put it to the ground. An ostler came forward with a stable lantern- Wild took hold of his own head with both hands. \" Look here, Tom Ripon, I wager you my head npon it\" \"Done!\" said Tom. Wild turned and left the oell. \" Hilloa, master ! tbat mare of yourn seems a bit baddish about the near fore-leg.\" \" She is. I must rest her a little, and she will soon get round again. It's an old hurt so nothing can be done with it. If you put her into a stable, all by herself, she wUl do capitally. Give her as much hay as she likes, and a good measure of corn, and let her be loose.\" \" All's right, sir. Come along, lass.\" Daisy limped along, and Heron led he. after the man into a comfortable stable, where he saw her snugly disposed of. \" Be yon a staying here ?\" asked the ostler. \" Yes ; I shall be buck again soon. I suppose some one is up here all night ?\" \" Oh, yes, there's a night watchman in the yard ; for, you see, sir, we has the York waggon here, and lots o' property.\" \" Oh, yes. I see ! I see !\" \" Thank yon kindly, sir.\" The shilling that Heron placed in the bands of the ostler was sufficient to satisfy him, and excite no suspicions, and Heron walked quietly out of the inn yard \" Hilloa I\" cried Tom Ripon. \" As I am going to win, Johnny, how am 1 to get your head ? Will you leave it out for me somewhere ?\" Wild walked hastily to the vestibule of Newgate, and laid his hand heavily on the shoulder of tho chief turnkey. \"Adams, that boy who is in cell No. 2 will make an attempt to get out by the most des perate daring and cunning in the world. He will be aided, from without, by all that money, skill, and courage can effect. Now, look to it \u2014 I want him!\" \" Oh, yes, Mr. WUd I\" \" He must not get away whUe one stone of New gate rests upon another. \" All right, Mr. WUd !\" Jonathan left the prison. \" Hoy, Wilkins I\" cried Mr. Adams. \" Pot the heaviest irons we have on that boy in No. 2. Be quick about it, and get Mr. Shanks to come and rivet them. 3_U. Wild wiU be wUd by nature as weU as by name, if he gets away from the old Stone Jug. I never saw him look so serious about any case in all my life.\" The heavy irons were placed upon Tom. They weighed sixty pounds \u2014 a tolerable weight to carry, provided Tom had any thought of escaping from Newgate. But he had no such thought, so far as a per sonal and unaided effort at escape was concerned. It was upon Oaptain Heron that he relied with that confidence whioh he, Heron, had succeeded in engrafting on the minds of all his band, and most certainly on none more than on Tom ,Ripon. , And he was right Heart and soul had Captain Heron set abeut the task of rescuing his faithful follower. CHAPTER CXXVI. CAPTAIN HERON MEETS WITH A NOBLB AND GALLANT OFFICER. Hekon walked composedly enough into Newgate Street, where, if Jonathan Wild had only guessed he was to be seen, he wonld soon have had twenty foes upon his track But if, as the saying is, virtue is its own reward, boldness is its own security ; and Heron really felt that he was as safe in Newgate Street as in any other thoroughfare of old London nu.vei. It was late U the night, thea, of that Thurs-"], [338, "EDITH HERON. 332 The tailor, with an appearance of timidity which was by no means lost upon Felix Heron, opened the door of his house with a latch-key. Voices came from a room on the right. One of those voices was feminine \u2014 the other had a round, rich, unctuous tone about it, such as would have become one of those He took a good long look at Jonathan WUd's house, and then he turned into the Old Bailey and sauntered past Newgate. A man came down the steps of the Governors house with a parcel in his hand. \" Ah, Wilkinson !\" cried Heron. \" How do you do?\" \"Monks of old,\" The man started back. \" Yon are mistaken, sir. My name is Jones. \u00ab No\u2014 surely you are Mr. Wilkinson ?\" \"Oh, dear, no!\" \" I beg you ten thousand pardons, really.\" \" Oh, no offence, sir, no offence. I am a tailor, sir, at your service. Shall be happy to supply you, sir. Best cloth, best workmanship, and reasonable prices, sir, at any time.\" \" But you come out of there?\" \"Out of Newgate, sir ?\u2014 oh, yes! I supply the Governor. There's an alteration wanted in a suit he wore to-day, and that he wants to wear to-morrow, and that's why I have come so late for it, as he had it on till half an hour ago.\" \" Ah, yes, I see. Well, Mr. Jones, I am looking for an inn or a lodging for the night ; but, if you will give me your address, I will call on you to morrow.\" We have often had occasion to state that there was about tbe appearance of Captain Heron a gentlemanly ease, and a prepossessing aspect, that irresistibly won people to look upon him with favourable eyes, and lhat natural letter of recom menda'ion did not fail him in the present instant. By the light of an oil lamp not far from the prison, the tailor was able to take a good obser vation of Heron, and he saw that, to use his own expression, he was quite the gentleman ; so, after only a moment's hesitation, he said, \" Sir, if you wouldn't mind going as far as Barbican, I can accommodate you with a capital room with a side view of Smithfield.\" \" If it would not be giving you too much trouble,\" replied Heron, \" it would be tbe very thing I should like.\" \" This way, then, sir, if you please.\" Heron and the tailor walked together towards Giltspur Street, and then Heron said in a casual sort of way, \" Is there any remarkable case in the old prison of Newgate just now ?\" \" Nn, no, sir! To be sure, Mr. Adams, the bead turnkey, I hear, is quite in a taking about a boy of the name of Tom something, wbo is to be tried to-morrow for stopping the Oxford mail and it's expected that he wiU try to make an escape, as they do say he is one of the gang of Captain Heron, of Epping Forest\" \"Indeed!\" who lived upon the best of everything, at the tables of the citizens of London. A rushlight was in the passage, and by its faint beams Captain Heron looked inquiringly into tbe face of the tailor, who replied to the look some what confusedly. \" It's\u2014 it's only Major Spickleback, sir, of the City Train Band. He is the great fishmonger of Cateaton Street, and a cousin, or something of lhat sort, to my wife; so he does us the honour of coming to supper often. I didn't quite expect him to-night, but here he is \u2014 I know his voice.\" Heron smiled. \" I shall be one too many \" \" No, no ! \u2014 oh, dear, no, sir ! \u2014 not at all ! You won't, indeed ! I shall be only too delighted.\" It was quite evident that the taUor would, on that occasion, much rather have tho oompany of the stranger he had picked up in the Old Bailey, than not. \" Wbo shall I say, sir, you are?\" he whispered. \" Mr Smith.\" \"Oh! Ah! Ham! Mr. Smith!\" The tailor flung open the door of the parlour, and called out the name of Smith in a tone th\u00bbt made his wife utter a faint scream, and indi-;ed Major Spickleback nearly to ohoke himself witl vie bone of a lark, which formed _. portion o! .he supper. \"You wretch! You hideous monster 1'- jried the lady. \" Madam,\" said Heron, as ae bowed, \" I am very sorry that roy personal appearance .loes not meet with your approbation.\" One glance at the youthful and handsome form of Felix Heron was quite sufficie-t to let the tailor's wife come to the conclusion that he was anything but the snrt of person to i-oti with her disapprobation. \" I don't mean you, sir, but that wrot-hod being, my husband.\" \"But, my dear,\" interposed th. tailor, \"the gentleman will take the blue room\" \" If you please, madaEi,\" added HeA-u. \"Oh, certainly \u2014 certainly! Pray, tit down, Mr. a\u2014 a \" \" Felix Smith, madam.\" \" Mr. Felix Smith, pray take a lark.\" The gallant Major of the City Train _Jand actually had his fork in the breast of tbe only remaining lark on the dish, when the tailor's wife dexterously rescued it from him, and handed it to Heron. \" Yes, sir ; but tbe boy is not likely to get out, for Mr. Adams has bad the heaviest irons put on him, and Mr. Shanks, the smith, who lives next door to me, was sent for all in a hurry to rivet them\" \" Then escape is out of the question?\" \" I should say so, sir. But here \u00ab e are, at Bar bican. I \u2014 I don't think my missus wUl make any objection. Ferhaps, sir, you are not a married man?\" The Major looked furious. Heron smiled. The tailor rubbed his hands with delight under the table. Nothing could be plainer than that he hated tho Major ; and if the stranger, Mr. Smith, bad eaten him, instead of the lark, Mr. Jones would have been quite delighted. Heron made up his mind now tbat, among these people, he would find the means of aiding Tom Ripon. It was nearly midnight. The Major looked at bis watoh. \" Hem!\" he said, in tbe riob, fat, unctuous voles \" Oh, yes, I am !\" \" Well, then, sir, you will make a few allow ances if my missus should not be in the best of humours.\" \" I will ; bnt if you think my coming is at all likely to produce any disagreeable \" \" Oh, no, no ! She will be only too glad to let the room, even for one night Come in, sir\u2014 come lul\""], [339, "EDITH HERON. 333 which he used to such perfection, that he must have made a study of it for many years past. \" Hem ! I think, Mrs. Jones, with yonr good leave, madam, I wUl say good night\" \" Not before you have had your posset, Major, surely ?\" said tho tailor. \" Well, I\u2014 a \" \" Oh, I am sure, on all the occasions that you have done us the favour of supping here, you have never gone away without your posset\" The Major smiled. \" I'll make it directly,\" said Mrs. Jones ; \" and perhaps Mr. Felix Smith will join in.\" The Major looked daggers. \"It depends,\" said Heron, \"npon what the posset is, madam. I have not so strong or thick a head as our friend the Major.\" \" Oh, it's only made of muUed canary, and old Jamaica, and honey, and sugar, and a slice of lemon.\" \" Good gracious, sir, it can't be! What has my life to do with a set of thieves, or a boy who is going to be hanged ?\" \" That is just what I am about to inform you. They have up their minds that the best and only way to save the boy is for some weU-known and respectable citizen of London to come forward at the trial to-morrow, and) support an alibi in favour of the prisoner. You are just the man. Yon wUl state that the boy named Tom Ripon, the prisoner at the bar to-morrow, was with you, helping you in any part of your business you choose to mention \u2014 say packing barrels \u2014 till midnight on Wednes day evening, and then he left your honse.\" \" But I can't say it.\" \" Then you will be caught and hanged in Epping Forest before eight days have elapsed from now. aptain Heron and his whole band have taken a solemn oath to that effect, and they will keep their word !\" \" Then I think I can manage to help the Major, madam.\" Mrs. Jones soon placed silver mugs on the table, aud the posset made its appearance in a huge tankard, and certainly was most deleotable. The lady then rose, and made an elaborate curtsey, as she said, \" I wUl now leave you, gentlemen, to yourselves. Jones, come along !\" \"Yes, my love!\" Felix Heron was left alone with the Major. Then the tailor popped his head into the room, and cried out, \" Your room, Mr. Smith, is the back room on the second floor You can take one of these candles.\" CHAPTER CXXVII. CAPTAIN HERON DISPOSES OF THE MAJOR'S SCRUPLES, AND TOM RIPON IS SAFE. As Heron made to Major Spickleback, of the City Train Band, this remarkable communication, he quietly sipped at the canary posset, and looked him calmly in the face. The Major was rather of a rubicund aspect, but now he turned blue about the nose, as he began to comprehend what was requested of him, and the penalty if he refused. \" But\u2014 but \" he gasped. \" Oh, there is no but in the case, my dear sir.

My business is now with you, sir.\" \" With me ?\" Heron smiled. \" My dear sir, yon don't know the men yon speak of. Tney are quite capable of laying hold ot you in the public street at mid-day, and carrying you off and hanging you, all within a couple of hours.\" \"Jusfcso. His Majesty's Government have for some time past had their eyes npon Epping Forest, where the notorious Captain Heron resides, to the great dissatisfaction of his Majesty's subjects and the great profitof his band.\" \"Well, sir?\" \" It is well ; for hitherto, Captain Heron has evaded aU the attempts at his capture, and I think will continue to do so.\" \"But what have I done that a set of \u2014 of ruffians, and murderers, and robbers should set npon me aud hang me at all ?\" \" You mistake. It will not be for what you do ; but if you reject the proposition, it will be for what don't do.\" \"It's flat perjury.\" \"Better than death!\" \"Ibope not, sir. The rascal!\" \" Hold, sir I Pray mind what you say, for I have every reason to think that Captain Heron, the highwayman, now hears every word we say.\" \"What?\" \" I can't do it.\" \" Consider. The boy is but a boy. Let him live. The sin of the perjury yon can set against the young human life that you wUl save, to say nothing of your own valuable existence.

WeU ?\" \" Hear me out Captain Heron and the whole of his baDd have made up their minds to a course of action which concerns your life.\" \" My\u2014 life ?\" \"Just so ; and I shaU be able in a few words to toll you how it does so."], [340, "334 EDITH HERON. morrow aud you wUl die a martyr to the truth and your own obstinacy.\" \" I\u2014 I\u2014 think\u2014 I \" powder too from that wig Captain Heron dashed upon his hand, and then rnbbed his face with it, so that his natural complexion was much changed. He thought he was so mnch altered that he might even venture upon showing himself in the court of the Old Bailey. To be sure, he might have there to encounter one pair of eyes it was most difficult to deceive \u2014 namely, Jonathan Wild's ; but as he did not intend to do more than simply mix with the orowd, he did not consider that a special danger. In this costume, then, Felix Heron made bis way to Bucklersbury, where reiided several of what were called thieves' lawyers \u2014 men whose whole practice lay in the court at the Old Bailey. One of those, Heron was soon introduced to, and he spoke to him with a solemn dignity that almost made the lawyer think he was really what he represented himself. \"Sir,\" said Heron, \"I am, as you may see, a olergyman. At the request of a parishioner of mine, I am here in London to do what I can for a prisoner who wiU be tried for bis life to-day.\" \" At the BaUey ?\" \"Yes.\" \" Well, sir ?\" \" Consent!\" \" It is well decided, sir. I need hardly tay that secrecy is absolutely necessary. To-morrow, at the court, an attorney will be instructed to defend the boy, and he in his turn wUl employ counsel, who, as a ieply to the charge against the lad, will set up an alibi, and call you to prove it. Be sure that you are there, for wherever you are and where ever yon may go, yon wUl be watched by \u2014 let me see \u2014 yes, exactly thirty-two eyes.\" \"Thirty-two?\" \" Yes, that is the number. And now, sir, commending your own safety to your own pru dence, I bid you good-night.\" Felix Heron rose, and taking one of the lights from the table, he quietly left the Major to his own reflections ; bnt he was by no .means quite satisfied that aU was exactly as he would wish it, and he resolved to keep an eye \u2014 or rather two eyes \u2014 out of thirty-two he had promised should be watchful of the Major npon him. With this object, Heron, after placing the light in the room on the second floor, stepped down stairs and waited in the passage- In about five minutes the Major came slowly out of the parlour, and made his way towards the street door; but just as he was on the point of stepping out, Heron caught him by the arm, and in a deep, sephulchral voice whispered the one word, \"Beware!\" \"Name?\" \" Thomas Ripon.\" \" Oh, ah I Know all about it Sure to be con victed and hanged. Can't do anything.\" Heron laid ten guineas in a lump on the table, and added, \" If you conld prove an alibi ?\" The lawyer shook hit head. \"Stale, my dear sir \u2014 too stale. The judges wont listen to it. Bless you, sir, a few years ago we could get up such a thing as easy as kiss your band. I had always some capital alibis, as we called our wituessses, on hand ; but it's been blown upon, you see sir, and got stale. It won't do, sir.\" The Major took but one spring out of the honse, and set off at speed to his own shop in Oateaton Street Heron, on the other side of the way, easUy kept a little ahead of him ; and upon reaching Cateaton Street, be law, by the light of one ot the street lamps, the sign-board of the fishmonger and Major. \" Thank heaven, I'm at home ! I'm at home !\" gasped the Major, as he reached his own thresh old. \" But this is a true one.\" \"Eh?\" \"Mr. Spickleback, the respectable and well known fishmonger of Cateaton Sreet, will come forward aud account for the prisoner's wholo time on the night of the alleged robbery.\" \" Will he ?\" But Heron was a pace or two before him, and met him face to face ; only Heron had put on a mask, and turned np the collar of his coat, so that his identity, so far as regarded the Major, was entirely lost Touching, then, the Train Band Maj_r on the arm, Heron, in quite a different voice from his own, or that which he had put on in the tailor's passage, again said \" Beware !\" This wa* too much for the Major, and he fell prostrate on the threshold of his own house. There Felix Heron left him, with every con fidence that he would do on tbe morrow what was required of him for the safety of Tom Ripon. The night was now far advanced, aud Heron felt now the necessity of repose if he would be active and stirring in Tom's behalf on the morrow. He made bis way to the old inn where he had left Daisy, and there took up his quarters for the night, caring little what effect his sudden and mysterious disappearance might have upon the tailor and his wife in Barbioan. \" He will.\" \" Then, sir, it's all plain sailing, and the lad is as safe as I am. It's very rare though, that Mr. Wild\u2014 and I understand that the boy is on his list \u2014 makes such a mistake as thai \u2014 very rare in deed.\" \" Nevertheless, sir,\" added Heron, \" snch is the fact, and you can call tbe witness.\" \" It shall be done, sir. I will fee and instruct counsel ; and if it be as yon say, why, an acquittal is certain.\" \" It is certain, then, sir ; and I have the pleasure of wishing you good morning.\" It was eight o'clock. At nine the court would open, and the trials would commenoe. With a feeling of great anxiety, notwithstanding all he had done to make Tom's escape certain, Felix Heron walked to the Old Bailey He made his way into the court among the first of the crowd, and he soon saw the attor ney in consultation with a counsel. Heron stopped the attorney as he was going out of the court In the morning, Captain Heron's first visit was to Daisy. His next was to a house in a by street of the City, where he purchased an over suit of olothes that made him look like a clergy man. A shovel hat and an umbrella, upon which he seemed to lean heavily, completed the attire. The wig he wore he had well powdered, and he pulled it down low over his brows Some of the \" Is all arranged ?\" \"Oh, yes, sir I The lad is safe enough. Mr. O'Tearem says that, if the witness is good, he will ensure the verdict of acquittal.\" While all this had been going on, the prelimi nary business < f the court wa? in progress, and"], [341, "335 EDITH HERON. Heron was startled suddenly to hear the name of Tom Ripon bawled ont alond. Tom's was the first trial. A little slip of paper, however, was handed to Tom from the attorney who had been employed to act for him, and when Tom opened it, he found that it only contained three words : \u2014 All ej es were directed to the dook, where, in a few seconds, onr old riend Tom Ripon made his appearance. \" Hold your tongue !\" Not in the least depressed or put ont of the way was Tom, at the rather awkward position in which his bad luck had placed him. What a happy thing is youth, and what another happy thing is thought lessness ! Tom Ripon possessed both Under the circumstances in which he was then placed, some minds would almost have given way before the weight of care and anxiety ; for death \u2014 inevitable death \u2014 was, so to speak, staring him in the face. \" I will,\" said Tom. \" Prisoner,\" said the judge, \" you have pleaded to the indictment, and it is not the proper time now for you to make any observations. Tbat proper time wUl come in dne course. \" Thank you!\" said Tom. A counsel rose to prosecute. He only said a few words, to the effect that he had the painful dnty of stating that, on the night named in the indictment, the Oxford mail was stopped, and all the passengers put in bodily fear, and one robbed, which he apprehended, if he could prove, would be quite sufficient for the purposes of the present indictment. Tom thought nothing of it. He was a highwayman, he told himself, and it was a part of his career to stop mail coaches, and an incident of his life to be what he called \" nabbed \" sometimes ; but as all his great heroes of the road had been in similar circumstances, and had managed more than otice to escape, and as that was his first time, he did not see that fae had anything to fear. Tom let his eyes roam ronnd the court, for he thought he might see some one he knew. Perhaps Ogle would be there \u2014 perhaps even Captain Heron himself ; and in this latter supposi tion our readers are aware that Tom was correct, bnt Heron did not think it prudent to place him self in the way of a recognition by Tom. Jonathan Wild was in conrt. The counsel then called George Castle, and the guard of the mail coach on the night in ques tion stepped into the witness-box, to give his evidence. \" Did you accompany the Oxford mail on the night iu question ?\" asked the counsel. '-I did.\" - State what happened ?\" \"A Uttle way off the private road, called the Cross Trees, the mail was stopped by somebody on horseback, just as one of the leaders feU and the other on top of him.\" \" Look at the prisoner at the bar 1\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Is he the person who stopped the mail.\" \" To be sure he is ! Though Well. I don't hardly think it could have been a boy Uke that It was a man's coat\" \" Then you swear to the prisoner ?\" \" WeU\u2014 I\u2014 a\u2014 do.\" It was the custom of WUd, on the occasion of the criminal trials at tbe Old Bailey, to place him self on a bench somewhere in the neighbourhood of the jury-box, where he could command not only a view of the prisoner and the witnesses, but take, as occasion offered, a sort of bird's-eye observa tion of the crowd of spectators. A oouple of his bull-dogs were always close at hand, to whom he could make signals to take into custody any one who was \" wanted,\" and who might have been incited by curiosity to make one in the throng of spectators of the trial. Captain Heron saw WUd assume this vantage post He saw, along with that, the absolute necessity of keeping himself quiet . Tom looked, for the moment, a little disap pointed at seeing no one in conrt whom he could feel was a friend ; but be did not abandon hope on that account, and repUed gaUy to some remark that was made to him by one of the gaolers of Newgate. And now the usher cries \"SUence!\" and the Clerk of the Arraigns proceeds to rear^an indict ment against Tom Ripon, which state- that he did, unlawfully and designedly, stop, obstruct, and attack the Oxford mail, and put into bodily fear certain persons \u2014 the names of two of whom were set forth ; all of which he was said to have done wilfnUy and maUciously, in contravention of the peace of onr Sovereign Lord, the King. Then Tom was asked to plead. \" Prisoner at the bar, do you plead ' Guilty,' or ' Not guUty,' to the charge just set forth against you?\" , , \" ' Not guUty I' \" said Tom. \" I wasn't there, nay lord.\" Now, Tom said this upon the spurt and thought of a moment; and as it happened, it was the best thing he could have said \u2014 inasmuch as it chimed in with the alibi that Heron had been at such \" That won't do,\" said the judge. \" Yon cannot swear to the prisoner, that is quite clear ; and yonr evidence only amounts to the fact that some one stooped the mail.\" The counsel for the proseoution was a Uttle mor tified. How soon men become partisans in any affair that they engage in, even although the Ufe oi a fellow- creature is the stake at issue. \" CaU Lord Mulcaster,\" he said. In a few minutes, the individual who had been styled \" My lord,\" in the mail coaoh, made his appearance, and was duly sworn. \" My lord,\" asked the counsel, \" were yon in the Oxford maU on the night in qneition?\" \" I was.\" \" Were you robbed when the coach was stopped by a highwayman ?\" \" I was.\" . What of, my lord ?\" \" A purse, with some copper money in it.\" There was a general langh. \"Shabby!\" said Tom. Tom's connsel rose, and said to the nobleman, \" Was there forty shUlings worth of copper money in the purse?\" \"Oh, no!\" . . T \" Then, my lord and gentlemen of the ]ury, 1 trust you will pause before you even entertain a charge of this nature, which only involves tho supposed loss of a few pence. Not that it matters in the least to the prisoner, who has a fuU answer t\u00ab the charge.\" pw'ns to prepare"], [342, "336 EDITH HERON. \"Saw it all!\" said the judge; \"and you did not, as a constable, interfere ?\" \"My lord, I apprehended and brought the prisoner to London If I had interfered sooner than I did it might have looked more like zeal, but it might, at the same time, have cost some one of the passengers in the coach his or her life.\" The counsel nodded CHAPTER OXXVIII. BDITH IS IN IMMINENT PERU. IN THE FOREST IN HERON'S AL-,U-NCE \" Brother,\" said the judge, to the counsel, \"there is nothing to stop the case upon, even should the amount stolen prove to be the smallest coin of the realm \" \" Go on, Mr. WUd.\" \" I saw the prisoner at the bar ride np to the mail, and I heard him threaten the passengers with death if they did not submit to be robbed by him. I took him, then, as soon as I could with safety \u2014 not to myself, for I despise on my own account aU such considerations \u2014 but to others, and the proof is that here he is.\" \" That wUl do, Mr. WUd. Perhaps my learned friend has something to say to you ?\" \"Heaven forbid!\" said Tom's counsel, with a shudder. \" I will not entioe that man to go on perjuring himself.\" Wild gave one of his demoniac smiles, as he left the box He looked upon Tom Bipon's fate as sealed. \" Now, my lord, wiU you have the goodness to look at the prisoner at tbe bar, and say if he is the person who robbed you.\" \" Oh, yes !\" \" You can swear to him ?\" \" Perfectly.\" \" I apprehend that will do,\" said the counsel. \" My lord, if your lordship and the jury would like to hear any further witnesses, I have them.\" \" You had better call them,\" interposed the judge. \" Of the two witnesses you have alroady clled, one only identifies the prisoner.\" \" Very good, my lord ! Call Obadiah Slow !\" \"Obadiah Slow!\" shouted the crier. And so, for a time, did everybody else, till Tom's counsel rose and spoke. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I appear for the prisoner at the bar, who is wrongfully ac cused of the offence named in the indictment ; and I am \u2014 fortunately for him, and I am sure, my lord, you will think fortunately for the interests of public justice \u2014 I am able to prove an alibi.\" \"A what?\" thought Tom Ripon. \"I wonder what the deuce an alibi is ?\" \" Friend,\" said the Quaker who had [been in the Oxford maU, as he stepped into the witness-box, \" I am here, and thou need not make so much noise.\" \" Take this book, and repeat after me \" \" Nay, I will not.\" \" Do you refuse to take the oath ?\" said the judge. \" Yea, I do ; but I will speak the trntb, for all that\" \" You cannot be heard, sir ! Go down \u2014 go down \" The court was all attention. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,\" con tinued the connsel, \"at tbe period of time, and for hours before it, and hours after it, when this Oxford mail was stopped by some one, I am able to state, and to prove, that the prisoner at the bar was engaged in quiet and creditable employment, in Cateaton Street, in the City of London.\" Wild laughed. \"Go it!\" said Tom, in a low voice, for he thought that his counsel was romancing at a great rate; although how that gentleman in the wig came to be his counsel, or to interest himself at all about him, was a complete mystery to him, Tom Ripon. \" Yes, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am happily in a condition to prove that much, not withstanding the indecent laughter of a man present who all the world kno ws is stained with every vice incidental to humanity.\" The allusion was evidently lo Jonathan Wild, who scowled defiance. \" Yea, I will.\" The Quaker gladly departed ; for the Act which empowered judoial persons to take tbe affirma tion of Quakers was not then in existence. \" Then, my lord,\" said the counsel, \" I have no more witnesses.\" The judge shook bis head. \" In a question of this gravity it would be satisfactory to have further evidence of identity, I think, gentlemen.\" Felix Heron thought from this that Tom Ripon wonld get off altogether, without the examination of Mr. Spickleback ; but that idea did not last many moments and it was at once dispelled by Jonathan WUd, who stepped forward to give what be thought would be the finishing stroke to the fate of Tom Ripon, who, now that he felt con vinced he should never serve him as a confede rate be was determined to hang at Tyburn. The moment the counsel for the prosecution caught the eye of Jonathan WUd, he knew that he had another witness in him, and he called out with some haste and exultation of manner \u2014 \" Mr. Jonathan Wild I\" \" Call,\" said the counsel, \" Major Spickleback, of the London Train Band.\" Wild looked astonished. \" It's as good as a play,\" said Tom, in a whisper. \" I wonder who he is.\" \" Is he your witness ?\" asked the connsel for Tom. \"Major Spickleback!\" shouted tbe crier. There was no re* p' \u2022- \u25a0 \" He is.\" \" Is his name on the back of the indictment ? \u2014 because, U not, surely it is irregular to call him\" \"Lost!\" said Heron, to himself. \"The fellow is either braver, or more cowardly, than I thought him.\" \" I apprehend not An officer of the police can be called at any time It has been ruled many times. \" Major Spicklebaok !\" Still no response. A cold, sneering smile came over the face of Jonathan Wild ; but hardly had it shown itself when a faint voice, at the back of the court, called out, \" Hore !\" \" Oh, I have no objection. It is not worth the disputing.\" \" Well, Mr. Wild, can you teU us, on your oath, anything of this affair ?\" \" I can. I was about the spot when the mail came up \u2014 I saw it all.\" Ileron breathed again. It was the voice of the gallant Major and fifjh monger, of Cateaton Street."], [343, "EDlTn HERON. 337 A commotion took place in the crowd, and gra duaUy the Major was brought forward te the witness-box. It was unfortunate for Wild that as the Major passed him he should hit upon the one word to say to him, of aU others, which had to the imagination of the unwilling witness a terrible significance. \" Beware !\" said Wild. Nobody know what ha meant by such expres sions, and he was hustled into the witness-box in another moment \"Now, sir,\" said the counsel. \"Is yonr name Spioklebaoi. ?\" \"It is.\" \"And you are a Common Councilman, and a Major in tbe Train Band, and a citizen of known wealth ia the City of London?\" \"lam.\" \"Oh, Lord! He's one of them, too!\" ga.ped the Major. Now aU that Jonathan Wild meant was that he, the Major, was to beware of what he might from some mistaken motive of humanity or otherwise, be abont say in favonr of the prisoner. A couple of feet further on the Major had to pass Felix Heron. \" Beware 1\" whispered Heron. \"Another!\" groaned the Major. \"The very oourt is full of them.\" \" A most respectable witness,\" said the judge. The counsel bowed. \" Now, Major, look at the prisoner at the bar, if yon please.\" The Major looked then, for the first time in his life, at Tom Ripon, who gave him a nod, and said, \"How do, old chap?\" \" Do you know the prisoner ?\" \" Oh, yes !

Oh! oil oh!\" Tom raised a hideous outcry ; and wuen a mob gathered, whioh it did in that momentary fashinu incidental to London streets, he called out, \" Good people all, do make Mr. Jonathan Wild let me alone. He wants me to go robbing for him, at the wages of twelve pounds a month ; and I want to keep myself a poor, honest boy, at five shillings a week, with Mr. Spickleback, barrelling herrings ! Oh! oh! oh!\" \"Shame! shame!\" cried the mob; \"down wilh him ! Knock him over I Pump upon him ! It's the vUlain Wild!\" In my private warehouse, barrelling herrings, on the night of the robbery, and he slept at my house How do, Tom ? Quife weU, eh ?\" Tom Ripon was astounded. So was Jonathan Wild. The judge leant back in his seat, and looked as if he were almost inclined to whistle, bnt that the dignity of the benoh forbade it \" I apprehend,\" added the counsel, \" that is suf ficient, my lord.\" Th3 judge put np a double eye-glass to his eyes, and looked at the Major for a few minutes in sUence. Then, in a solemn tone, he said, \" Be fore requesting you to repeat your evidence to me and the jury, I have but one word to say to you, Mr. Spickleback, and that is, beware!\" \" Gracious powers !\" said the bewUdered Major i \" can ho, too, be one of them ?\" \" What do you mean, sir, by those expres sions ?\" \"Nothing, my lord \u2014 oh, nothing; but I will beware \u2014 indeed, I will !\" \" Yon had need, sir, for this is a very serious inquiry ; and I ask yon again, on your oath, are you quite snre the prisoner at the bar was, on the night named in the indictment, barreUing her rings?\" \" Oh, quits, my lord I\" \" Quite !\" said Tom. \" To be snre I was. We put 'em aU in, heads and tails !\" \" Then, gentlemen of the jury,\" said the judge, \" there ia an end of the case.\" Jonathan got angry. \" Very good, Mr. Tom Ripon,\" he said ; \" you and I wiU meet again at Tyburn.\" \" Perhaps it won't be convenient for me to come, \" said Tom, \" when you are turned off. bnt I shaU be able to read all about it in the Flying Past.\" \" Bah I\" said Wild, as he made off, amid tbe hootings of the mob, to his own house. It was at that moment that some one touched Heron on the shoulder, and upon facing rouud ho saw a country-looking grazier, whom he instantly recognised to bs one of his own band. \"Number soar?\" \" Yes, Captain! the letter.\" There was a something abont the look of this man's face, which gave Heron a cold chill, and he hastUy tore open the letter. It contained the following words : \u2014 \" Not guilty I\" said the foreman of the jury. \" Clever !\" said Wild, as he ran his eyo over all cha throng of persons in the conrt to see if he could detect any face that would give him a clue to the proceedings. Bat Felix Heron was too well disguised, aud t_o much mixed np with the crowd, 1 1 be recognised. Could he have seen him alone, there is little doubt but Wild would have known him in an instant; but, as it was, he was baffled. \" The Lady Edith has been alarmed in the forest, and was for a time a prisoner in the hands of two of Jonathan Wild's men, bnt is now at liberty. Hasten home, Captain, for theie are spies in the wood!\" \" From Cgle ?\" said Heron. \"Yes, Captain!\" \" Have you a horse ?\" \" Oh, yes\u2014 in Smithfield.\" \" FoUow Tom Ripon, then, and take him up on your horse, and make the best of your way, both of yon, to the forest I shall be th;re before you.\" The man hastened after Tom, and Oaptain Heron, at a pace which in itself would have oeen sufficient to engender suspicion, made his way to wards St. Martin's- le- Grand for Daisy. Jonathan Wild was at one of his windows, just as Heron passed on the other side of the way, and the moment he saw him, Wild clapped his hands and oried out, \" Cap. ain Heron, for a thousand pounds I\" If Jonathan Wild had then been quite cool and collected, he would have had a fair chance of cap turing Heron ; but on tbat occasion he was not, and instead of going at once into the street, he flung open the windows and called aloud, \" Stop himl Stop him! A highwayman! Stop him! There he goes I\" Heron looked up to the window, and waved his hand ironically ; he then turned the corner of Newgate Street into St. Martin's-le-Grand. He know that Jonathan Wild would be upon his heels in a few seconds, and he made what might be called almost a rush towards the old i___ where he had left Daisy. Once mounted, he would have nothing to dread; from all the power that Wild oonld by any possibility muster against him. \" The prisoner is discharged,\" said the judge, <* and may go about his business.\" \" Barrelling herrings 1\" muttered WUd. Tom Bipon felt a little bewUdered when the side of the dock was unbolted, and he was un ceremoniously pushed ont by one os' tha officers of Newgate. Where to go \u2014 what to do for the best \u2014 and to what hidden p.genoy to attribute his preservation \u2014 Tom Ripon was completely at a loss. He reached the door of the court easily, for th. people made a lane for him, and in so reaching it his arm actually touched that of Captain Heron. But Heron took no notice of Tom, for he saw that Jonathan Wild had never, for half a moment, taken his eyes off tbe prisoner since his libera tion. And so Tom paused out of the conrt Jonathan Wild followed bitn. Then Captain Heron followed WUd. The position sf these three persons, in regard to each other, was now very strange indeed. They all, with the exception of Wild, in relation to Her .a, kept a strict watch the one upon the other. At the corner of the Old Bailey, WUd stepped r_p to Tom Ripon \"Capital!\" ho oried. \"WeU, my fine little ftUow, how did you manage it, and where are you going now?\" \" To finish the herrings,\" sai 1 Tom. \"Oh, staff! Come, now, I admire you more than ever. Be one of my men, and yon shall"], [345, "EDITH HERON. 339 It was only a question of a few minutes, one way or the other. Dashing into tbe inn yard, Heron said not one word, but made his way through to the stablo where he knew well he should find bis old and incomparable friend Daisy. The ostler ran after him. For the space of about thirty seconds \u2014 certainly not more \u2014 Jonathan Wild lost sight of Captain Heron, as the latter turned the corner of Newgate 8treet into St. Martin's-le-Grand. Then he saw him again ; and he was confident he had turned into one of tho inn yards. \" Nabbed at last 1\" shouted WUd ; and, as his men came up, he almost yeUed ont, \" Horses ! \u2014 horses, in the King's name !\" As Ul luck would have it, eo far as the horses were concerned, there happened to come, at an easy trot, round St Paul's Churohyard, at that time a couple of horses, led by a groom iu the livery of the Lord Mayor, who rode a third horse. WUd sprang upon the groom as though he had been the object of his peculiar search for the last fifty years, and he had only ju9t caught him. \"In the King's name \u2014 in ihe Kiag'a name1\" be shouted. \" I borrow these horses on the King 's service I Resist at your perU !\" Tb9 groom had no more idea cf resisting than of putting his shoulder to the corner of St Paul's, and trying to push it over. He wa. one of those quiet, slow-thinking men who, if taken by sur prise and hurried, have to sort of control over events, and are perfectly inert, and at the mercy of any one. The three horses, then, were easUy taken pos session of ; and Wild was on one, and two oi his buU dogs on the others. \"Nabbed!\" shouted Wild again. \" We ba.e him ! Fire only when I give the word, my bull dogs, and then be snre you bring down your man !\" Wild dashed forward. \" Sir, I have thought it would be better to bind up that leg !\" The ostler had got just that far in his remarks about Daisy, when Captain Heron called ont aloud, \" Ho, Daisy ! Daisy, ho!\" The stable door was dashed open by a violent kick, and, to the astonishment of the ostler, Daisy made one of her tremendous leaps right out into the middle of the inn yard. Bnt she waa unsaddled and unbridled. \" Idiot !\" cried Heron to the staring ostler. \"Did I not tell yon to keep the horse ready for the read ?\" \" Bnt the \u2014 a \u2014 lame foot ! I thought that a that Oh, dear me ! They are both mad !\" CHAPTER CXX1X. CAPTAIN HERON TAKES A GALLOP TO EPPING, AND FINDS DANGER IN THE WOOD. The conduct both of Captain Heron and Daisy was eminently calculated to excite the surprise and fear of the ostler of the old inn in St Martin's-le- Grand. The pretend. ' lameness of Daisy had disap peared almost as if caused by magic. Captain Heron vaulted at once upon the back of his gallant steed without waiting for either bridle or saddle. He did not try to go into any of the inn yards in search of Heron. In the first place, he was not quite sure which one he had gone into. In the next place, a contest in the open street would be much more embarrassing to Heron than in the more confined space of an inn yard, where, for all he, Jonathan Wild, knew to the contrary, Heron might have assistants and confederates tha: might make his capture anything but easy. Past, then, all the large inns went WUd, olosely soUowed by his men. Then be faced abont in the middle of the road way, shouting, as he did so, \"Halt! Right about face ! Get your pistols ready, my men I\" Wild moved forward about two horses' lengths in advance of his men, and then he waited for Heron. \" Off and away, my Daisy!\" he cried. \" There is peril in the air we breathe !\" Daisy at once comprehended the mood of her rider. She felt that something more than usual was expected from her in sagacity and speed. With another leap, that so frightened the ostler that he fairly ran into a vacant stable and shut the door, Daisy reached the entrance of the inn yard, and emerged into the open air. It was not a moment too soon. Jonathan WUd, as soon as, by the natural im pulse that came over him, he had opened the win dow of his honse in Newgate Street, and given an alarm, had felt that he had made a mistake. To close the window, rush out of the room, and almost precipitate himself down the stairs of his house, were the proceedings of certainly not more than half a minute. The alarm in the street that something serious was amiss and about to happen, was immediate : some of the passengers ran into shops \u2014 o:her_ stood upon door-steps. Windows began to be thrown open in all directions, and several vehicles drew up to the road-side, their drivers looking upon the presence cf WUd and his two men in the light of a sort of blockade of the road. And these events, althongh numerous aDd varied in their character, took place with such rapidity and so simultaneously, that the time they occupied was inconceivably smaU. Daisy had only time to take the first leap from the stable, and tben to stand stUl while Heron mounted, aud then to take the second leap to the inn entrance, when WUd was fairly in possession of the road,, \"FoUow \u2014 foUow, janissaries and bull- dogs \u2014 follow me !\" That shout brought half a dozen of his men at his heels, and he tore up Newgate Street as though he in his turn were chased by fiends, instead of bring, in reality, the fiend who chased Captain Heron. That Heron had his horse somewhere close as hand Jonathan Wild did not entertain the least donbt If that horse were Daisy, and if Heron shonld only once succeed in getting mounted, and a good start, WUd felt how hopeless would be all pur suit The calculation of Jonathan was a good one, of course. Felix Heron, npon emerging from tlif. inn yard, must either go to tile right or to the left. If to the left, he encountered Wild and the two mounted janiasries. If to tbe right, there were Wild's other men ou foot It was to prevent snch being the case, therefore, that he strained every nerve to catch Heron before he could reach the place, wherever it was, where he had left Daisy."], [346, "340 EDITH HERON, crowu of which there lay a thin plate of steel, whioa had been more than once the mentis of saving bis li e, aud it did so in this inst.uon, although the distributed blow he got on tbe head was almost enough for death. \" On, Daisy I\u2014 on!\" again shouted Heron. Daisy shook off the grasp at her mane in an in stant, and dashed forward. But Jonathan fully believed that Heron would turn his way, because it was the best route for a horseman towards Epping Forest, and so he kept his eyes riveted npon the entrance to the inn jard whe'e he had thought he had seen Herou enter. The great thief-taker had not to wait very long. Daisy had taken ber second leap, and then she emerged into the open road. Wild said not a word, but he made the horse he rode step forward a few teer. more, aud, draw ing a pistol from hia ooat pocket, he waited tor Heron. \"No, you don't!\" cried the janissary who had bold of Daisy. \" You don't go off quite so easy as all that !\" This man sired one of his pistols, and then the other, as fast as he could bring them to the level, at Heron and Daisy. There was blood npon Daisy's neck. She was bit One glance showed Captain Heron the state of affairs. To bis right, a crowd of people, and some old lumbering coaches, nearly blocked up the narrow part of St. Martin 's-le-Granl. To his left was Jonathan Wild and the two mounted janissaries. Captain Heron turned and looked at the man fixedly, while Daisy stood like the statue of a horse. He took from his breast one of the long- barrelled, ornamental pistols be always had with him, and presented it at the janissary. \" My turn !\" he said. \" No\u2014 no ! Don't ! Oh, don't I Knook him over somebody, or I'm a dead man !\" The bull-dog held his hat before his face, as though that would shield him from a bullet. Bang ! went Heron's pistol. The hat was tossed to the ground with a small round, ragged-looking hole in the crown of it and the janissary fell from his horse with a loud cry. He must pass them or perish. Never, perhaps, before had Felix Heron shown such promptitude and capacity for action as in the present emergency. He did uot give Wild time to think, or to take aim at him with the pistol he held, but, giving Daisy an impulse forward, he shouted out, \"Over him \u2014 over him, Daisy ! Ride the villain down ! Over him!\" Daisy then made a third leap. That leap saved Heron's life, for Wild fired at the moment and the buUet grazed his arm slightly. Wild tore from its sheath the formidable hanger that he wore at his side, but before he could strike a blow with it, Felix Herou was upon him. Daisy reared on her hind feet and put her two fore ones right ou to Jonathan Wild and his horse, pawing him desperately with his iron shoes, to his great detriment Heron made a vigorous clutch at the hanger, and oaught it by tbe blade close to the hilt so that, taking Wild by surprise, as the action did, he fairly wrenched the weapon from his grasp. But Wild's two men had not been idle. Captain Heron had a slight flush upon his face, as he turned Daisy's bead towards the country. and again cried out, \" On, on, my gallant Daisy ! On, for liberty and life!\" Daisy flew forward with that rerrifio bounding gallop that no mortal steed, save some Arabian of the desert, could ever bave hop ed to rival. The contest was over. Ten minutes took Daisy a good four miles from the city. Then Captain Heron drew np, or, rather, he patted the neck of Daisy, and spoke to her tiU she gradually came to a stand still They were iu the green lanes about Stoke Newiugton. A pretty rural-looking public house was close at hand on the road-side, and, dismounting, Herou led Daisy to the thresheld of it One of them caught Heron by his left arm, and the other seized Daisy by the mane, in default of a bridle to lay hold of. Then Heron swayed round npon Daisy's back, and one downward blow from the hanger sent the mau who had hold of his arm iu the road on his face. He was excessively anxions to discover the nature aud the extent of the wound that Daisy had received. \"Hilloa! house! house!\" he cried. \"Is no one here?\" \" On, Daisy, on '\u25a0\" \" Not yet 1\" yelled Wild, as he drew another pistol, and held it full in the face of Heron. \"Ha! ha! At last I at last! Good morning and good night to Mr. Felix Heron, aliae the great Earl of Whitcombe 1\" The landlord and landlady of the little hostel both appeared, looking very much surprised to see a man and a horse, without either bridle or saddle, at the door. \" Some warm water and a sponge I\" cried Heron \" My horse is wounded, 1 hope I may say slightly, in the neck.\" \" Lor', sir ! have yon met a highwayman ?\" \" I suppose so. Be quick !\" The sponge and the warm water were soon procured, and it was, to the inexpressible relief of Felix Heron, that he found the hurt of Daisy to quite superficial, and of no real moment what ever. WUd pulled the trigger. Flash went the pistol. The powder in the pan had ignited, but it had failed to explode the pistoL Perhaps FeUx Heron had never been quite so near death as at that moment but so soon as he saw what had happened, be knew that he was safe. Down came the hanger npon the head of Jona than WUd. \" Confound the fool!\" said Heron to himself; \" why did he barter his own life upon such a shot ; but he would brave it and the deed is done.\" The blow was a good one, and delivered with Rood intent, and it ought to have been more effec tive than it was, although it could hardly be com plained of, for it made Wild reel in bis saddle, and evidently confused his faculties for the time The fact was, that WUd bad on a hat, in the \" Why, sir,\" said the landlord, \" there is ever so much blood on your sleeve.\" \" Ah, yes, I too was hit But it is nothing."], [347, "KDITH HURON. 341 Do you happen to have a saddle you could tell me. tbat will \u00bbbout sit my horse?\" \" Oh, dear, yes, sir. Jcbn, you get that saddle that belonged to the old grey.\" The eadrile the landlady alluded to was brought, aid fitted Daisy tolerably, so that Heron was not at all displeased to give a guinea for it, and, re mounting, he raised himself as high as he could in the stirrups, and took a good look about him. The country was still and quiet \u2014 not the least appearanoe of any pursuit could be heard or seen. A love of hordes was a perfect mania with Sir Joseph Teasdale, and hi* attention was no sooner directed towards Daisy, than he became deeply interested by ber. CHAPTER CXXX. CAPTAIN HERON PLATS AN ARTFUL TRICK TO THE 0FF1CS .3, ASD ESCAPES IN SAFETY. * That, then, is over for the present,\" said Heron ; \" and now for a ride to old Epping \" As he spoke he thought he beard a faint sonnd npon the still air, as of the rapid tread of horses' feet afar off. \" She is a beauty !\" was the exclamation of Sir Jos;ph Teasdale, as he looked with the eyes of a connoisseur at Daisy. Heron smiled. \" Do you think her, sir, nearly equal to yotr horse Highflyer?\" \" Sir, I should b_ very sorry to think anything on four legs equal to Highflyer.\" Heron bowed slightly, as much as to say that he did not wish to make any argument on the matter. \" Mr. Landlord,\" ho said, \" do you hear any thing?\" \" Yes, \u00abir. Horsemen on the road, I should say. Perhap's i'ts the gentlemen of the hunt\" \"* Are they out then, to-day ?\" \"Yes, sir; and Sir Joseph Teasdale, he is ont with his famous horse Highflyer, that has won all the cups at all the races lately.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Neverthless,\" added Sir Joseph Teasdale, wbo was a litle piqued at being given way to so qnitely, \u2014 \" nevertheless, I am tree to say that 1 never saw an animal that pleased me so much by its looks as this.\" \" Yes, sir ; they do say that for eight minutes Highflyer can go the mile a minute.\" \" That is scarcely possible.\" W(>ile Heron was speaking he felt confident that he heard the sounds of the horses' feet of the approaching horsemen still nearer, and he was still debating in his own mind what would be the best plan to pursue, when from the leufy entrance to a green lane, about half, or a quarter of a mile off, the \"gentlemen of the hunt\" emerged. Heron counted sixteen horsemen in all. \" She is something more than beautiful,\" said Heron, as he patted Daisy. \" Will you escuse me, sir,\" said another of tbe hunt, \" for a rude question?\" \" It cannot be rude, sir, when it is beforehand apologized for.\" \" Then, sir, wiU any money buy that mare?\" \"No, sir.\" \" \" I thought not\" Heron sighed. His thoughts, at that moment, flew back to the time when the late Earl of Bridge water had so pertinaciously endeavoured to pur chase Daisy of him, and came by bis death as a consequence a: the hands of tbe arch-villain LorU Warringdale. \" Have you had her long, 6ir ?\" asked Joseph. \" Since she was a foal.\" They were, no doubt, in the ordinary accepta- tion of the word, all well mounted ; but his curiosity was excited to see the celebrated High- flyer, of which he had often beard. For a few seconds the scarlet-coated huntsmen 6eemed in doubt, after they had emerged from the lane, as to which way they would go, and then they tnrned towards the little roadside inn. Heron saw that unless he rode in tbe direction towards London again that a meeting with them would be inevitable. To shrink from it wonld be at once to provoke suspicion, so he rode slowly forward, and soon met tbe party. \"Good morning, sir!\" cried a bluff-locking country gentleman. \" Goot morning, sir !\" responded Heron. \" I hope, sir, with that bit of blood, you are going to the 'meet?' \" \" Blood ?\" \" WeU, it is an odd thing to me that there cou'd be such a mare in all England and I not know something about her, fora more perfect creatuie I never saw.\" \" Why, Sir Joseph,\" said another of the bunt, \" we have all heard of one mare who is the won der of every one, and who it is said belongs to i_e famous highwayman, Captain Heron.\" At these words, all eyes were turned towards Captain Heron and Daisy, but he looked q'i:t** composed, and still patted Daisy's neck. \" May I ask, sir,\" said Sir Joseph, \" if the mare has a name ?\" Heron mistook the meaning of tbe word at the instant for he was thiukiug of Daisy's slight wound in tbe neck. \" Oh, yes !\" \" And \u2014and \" \" Oh, I see !\" added the bluff looking country gentleman : \" your mare has had a bad scratch on the neck.\" \" Tho name is Daisy.\" There was a commotion among ihe gentlemeu of the hunt, and they looked at each other, and at Heron suspiciously. \" Gentlemen,\" he added, \" since I have given yon the name of my mare \u2014 I may as well give you my own likewise.\" Slightly raising his hat, then, Heron added, \" I am the Earl of Whitcombe, commonly known w Captain Felix Heron.\" \" She has, sir !\" The whole of tbe \" hunt\" crowded round Heron and Daisy ; and the expressions of admiration for the latter were loud and general. \" What a beauty I Look at her eyes ! A'int she a rare one I A pure breed ! What a walk ! Sir Joseph, only look at her I \u2014 she is a fit mate for Highflyer 1 She is a beauty !\" Felix Heron found from this that the blnff-look \u00a3ng country gentleman was Sir Joseph Teasdale, the celebrated sporting baronet, aud tbe owner of the race-horse Highfl jor, which at a glance Heron saw he then rode. \" By George !'\" cried Sir Joseph Teasdale. The gentleman of the hunt looked at each other in surprise. * Yes, gentlemen, I am tbat person, and this it my celebrated fnend Daisy ; and now that I bt.ro"], [348, "EDITH HERON. 342 i He had been too far off to hear what ha . passed, and he conld not make out what the odily ordered arrangements were for. But Sir Joseph Teasdale was his master, and he obeyed him at once. The party of officers rode up. Then, and not tiU then, did Captain Heron see that Jonathan WUd led them. The thief-taker had a red handkerchief tied tightiy round his head, which, by the contrast of its colour with his face, gave him a ghastly and cadaverous look. WUd touched his horse with the spur, and rode forward. trusted you, and as yon are all gentlemen, I feel that I have nothing to dread and nothing to con tend with ia your company.\" It was Sir Joseph Teasdale who then spoke for the rest \" Certainly\u2014 certainly !\" he eaid. \" We should ill merit the name of gentlemen if we were ca pable of dreaming for a single moment of betray ing yon.\" Heron bowed. \" All right I aU right!\" cried several of the hunt.\" \" And for my part, I am quite delighted,\" added Sir Joseph, \" at the opportunity of getting a good look at Daisy, of whom I have heard so much, and concerning whom I have only one favour to ask of yon, Captain Heron.\" \" Name it, sir.\" \" WUl you let me see her take a run for a mile?\" \" GenUemen all, my service to yon,\" he said. \" Have yon seen a thin, tall yonng man pas. here on a dark bay mare.\" \" Who are you, sir?\" said Sir Joseph Teasdale, \" that asks questions on the highway.\" \u00ab I am Jonathan Wild\" \" With pleasure. Oh, oh, Daisy ! Off, lass with the wind !\" Daisy took one of her leaps, and then off she went In two minutes she was back a_rain, and, had not tnrned a hair, or in the sUghtest degree quickened her breathing. \" Sir,\" said Sir Joseph Teasdale, \" you have ti-ou all our friendship by showing that you trusted us. You could easUy have galloped on, and no cue could have prevented you, for I confess, now, Chat Highflyer has found his match.\" Heron smiled. WUd made one of his most hideous faces as he spoke, and, indeed, it was quite a custom with him to do so whenever he thought that any one saw him for the first time. He seemed to glory in the detestation and dis like in which he was held. \" Oh, you are Mr. WUd?\" \" I am ! You will know me again, sir. There are not two like me in the world.\" \" That's something to be thankful for,\" said Sir Joseph Teasdale. The gentlemen of th9 hunt laughed, and Jona than WUd did not look over weU pleased at the retort. \" I don't know yet, Sir Joseph,\" he said, \" that your beautiful Highflyer has found hie match, but ,\"\u2022\u25a0\u25a0 heart has some anxieties tugging at it just now that makes it heavy, and I bave the favour to ask of you not to seek to detain me any longer.\" \" Certainly not Not for the world\u2014 not for t_.e world! Good morning, sir \u2014 good morning!\" Heron raised his hat again to tbe gentlemen of the hunt when, at the moment, he heard a strange echoing kind of cry in the distance, that sounded .'ike an alarm of some kind. \" Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \" I ask in the course of my duty a civil question, and I think I ought to have a civil answer.\" \" Then, sir, no \u00abuch person has passed ns on the road,\" said Sir Joseph Teasdale. This was literally true, for there was Captain Heron in the midst of them, thereforu he conld not be said to have passed them. WUd looked rather suspicious, but what could he say ? All he saw beforo him waa a throng of gentlemen with scarlet hunting-coats, and it cer tainly never struck him that among them he might look for Felix Heron. The huntsmen aU heard it at the same time, aud Sir Joseph Teasdale looked serious. \"Captain Heron,\" he said, \"have you any ' - isou to think that you are pursued.\" \" It is probable.\" \" You had better be off, then, I take it j for look .here \u2014 what does that mean ?\" \" Thank you, air,\" he said ; \" that is all I wasted to know just now.\" There was an emphasis npon the manner and tone of Wild which struck upon the ear of Heron, but he could not comprehend what the thief-;akcr meant by it. WUd rode on towards town, followed by his men. At a turning in the road, some quarter of a mile off, they saw appear about a dozsu horsemen, who were officers of the police, without a doubt. \" Yes,\" said Heron ; \" it appears, gentlemen, that I am pursued. Good day !\" \"Stop!\" said Sir Joseph. \"Stop! It is I iircely worth while to give Daisy a gallop, and tbe ohanoe of some stray shot Stay with us. We can lend you a red coat ; my man, yonder, has one in the vaUse at bis back, and, no donbt we can find you a regular hunting-cap \u2014 oue of the whippers-in shall change his for youis, and the dence is in it if, among us aU, those fellows will think to look for you.\" \" I wUl not reject a proffered kindness,\" said Heron, \"even although I migat do weU without it I accept your offer, sir.\" The huntsmen gathered round Heroc and the c'aange in his appearance was rapidly effected, so taat by the time the party of officers were suffi ciently near to be seen well Felix Heron looked exactly Kke one of the members of the hunt The only person who looked surprised at tbe , whole affair was the whipper-in, who was re- 1 q nested to change hats with Heron. The whole of the hunt turned to look after him, for in his way certainly Jonathan WUd was quite as great a celebrity as Captain Heron and his horse Daisy. As Wild passed the whipper-in, whs was some hundred yards or so from the party of huntsmen, be said to him, \" I t's truly curious, for my news of a man on a dark bay blood mate Ab !\" Wild pointed to the whipper-in's head, on which was Heron's hat. \" Ah, my friend! where did yon get that hat?\" \" Master told me to ohange with a gentlman on such a maro as I never clapped eyes on in all my life, aud never hope to do so again unless it's great good luck.\" Jonathan Wild, on the iuipnlse oi the moment, raised a shout, and immediately faced his horsu towards the huntsmen \" Gentlemen,\" said Felix Heron, when he saw this movement, \" WUd has got tho information ha"], [349, "EDITH HERON. 343 wanted from the whipper-in, and I had better be off.\" Already was the distance between Heron and Wild more than qudrnpled. The fact was that Jonathan did not care to hurry himself. AU he wished was to keep his prey in sight But this was perfectly inexplicable to Felix Heron. Whenever he turned to look behind him on tbe route he had traversed, he saw Wi'd and his men maintaining just abont the same general distanoe from him. \"Confoui.d tbe long-tongued fool!\" said Sir Joseph 'Ceaadiilo. \" I have no doubt it is just as you say.\" \" Good day, and many thanks I\" cried Heron. Even as be spoke, he separated himseU frotu the group cf huntsmen and trotted off alone down the roai?. Jonathan Wild then raised another shout, and pnt his horse to a gallop. He was closely soUowed by his men ; and Felix Heron could not imagine what WUd could hope to gain by a pursuit of him across the country to Epping, which could not be of any benefit to him, Wild, since no horse that he had could hope to come up with the incom parable Daisy. Wild, however, was playing his own game, and it was one that Heron did not suspect although we shall at once put the reader in possession of it When Jonathan was left in St. Martin's-le- Grand so signally defeated, his first movement upon recovering from the stunning blow he had received, was to go into the inn yard and question the ostler. \" Hilloa, you feUow, there ! \u2014 a guinea or a baiter, which do you like best ?\" \" Lor', sir, the guinea.\" \" There it is. Now, toU me aU abont that high wayman you had here.\" \" Bless us and save us ! was he a highwayman, Mr. WUd?\" \" To be sure he was, and yon know it.\" \" I'U take my blessed davy I didn't ; and if I had. it isn't likely I'd a given his 'oss such a dose of Rumsey's drops.\" \" What ?\" If he was on the brow of a bill, they were at the foot of it If he reached a valley they were seen to appear looking do wn upon him from the eminence that was above. \" What do they mean by it ?\" he asked himself. \" E-en Jonathan Wild cannot be ignorant that my destination is Epping Forest, and what good does ho look for from the mere fact of dogging me there.\" But an uneasy feeling began to grow np in the mind of Heron, dispute all this reasoning. There was too evident an uniformity of danger about the way in which WUd kept him in view, for it to be destitute of some design. The only question was, \" What it could be ?\" A feeling, then, of impatience began to come over Heron, and he made np his mind that he would put an end to the state of things that had become annoying to him by letting Daisy make snch speed as should soon place a tract of country between him and WUd that no observation of tha acntest eyes could pass. \" On, my Daisy, on ! To the forest that wa both love ! To the deep and beautiful shadows of the old trees of Epping. On, my Daisy, on !\" Daisy pricked np her ears \u2014 she uttered a sound, such as she was acoustomed to ntter when he specially spoke to her. She dashed forward a few yards, and then slightly stumbled. It was the first time. A pang of alarm shot through the heart of FeUx Heron. For the first time in his Use his entire and complete dependance upon Daisy had passed away, and he felt like some mariner on a vast ocean, who finds that the planks of the good ship, that he thought would for ever stand be tween him and death, were giving way beneath him. \" Ramsey's drops.\" \" Why, they set a horse to sleep in a few hours, \u25a0so that he is aU but like a dead caicass\" \"They does, Mr. Wild; and if there's one thing more than another I prides mysetf on, it is in physicking 'osses. Now, that blood mare came in with a lame foot, and says I to myself, says I, ' I don't eare what that long master of her's sa.\\ s, I'll give her some Rumsey's drops.' \" \u00bb fl* I ha 1\" <9> \"Oh, don't\u2014 don't!\" \"Don't what idiot?\" \" Don't laugh in that way, Mr. WUd.\" \"Speak! When did you give the mare the drops?\" \" At half-after nine o'clock.\" \" She'U droop, then, and want to go to sleep, and loose aU her speed and spirit by about half-past twelve, won't she ?\" \" As snre as a gun, Mr. WUd !\" \" Ha ! ha ! I have him\u2014 I have him now I\" WUd summoned his bnU-dogs; and judging well the route that Heron would take, he started, well mounted and well armed, in the hope that f >r once in a way D ;isy would faU her master in his hour of need, and he would consequently be come a certain captive, if not an easy one. Little did Heron imagine the state of things npon which Wild calculated. As yet Daisy had shown no symptoms whatever of flagging in the least on his journey, and he had the fullest confidence in her speed. \u2022' Oh, let them eome, my gallant Daisy ! We will fly before the wind, and leave them so far be iiind that no stray shot shall make another fur crow on your neck.\" But yet, after aU, it might be only an accident Daisy was mortal. She was liable, in a degree, for all the incidents and accidents that conld beset the career of any other steed. He drew breath again. \" Gently, my Daisy, gently !\" he cried. \" AU is well ! Off now, and away, as you were won't to do when the flying gale could not outstrip you ! \u2014 off and away, my gallant Daisy !\" The noble creature made a plunge forward, and then stumbled again. The \" drops\" that the ostler had given her, at the inn in St. Martins-le-Grand, were beginning to have their sffeot It was, as nearly as possible, the time of the day at whioh it was predioted by Jonathan Wild that the almost reflecting creature, so wonderful was she in her sagacity, would begin to feel the effects of the opiate that had been administered to No doubt the fine nervous system of the gallant oreatnre sympathized more readily than would a more sluggish nature with the influence of the \" drops.\" She staggered forward. Her head, usually so erect, was bowed down. Daisy galloped on."], [350, "344 EDITH HERON. He took one anxious glance behind him and it was the satisfaction of about a minute to find that his foes were not in sight. Her bright eyes were dim. \"lam lost !\" said Felix Heron. Then Jonathan Wild raised a ringing shout, and cried aloud to his men, \" On, on I tne prize is ours I It's a thousand pounds reward, and by all that's good it shaU this time be share and eb \u00bbie alike!\" He strode up to the cottage door, and rapped at it with the batt-end of one of his pistols. A very aged woman opened the door, and looked at him with surprise- \" Mother,\" said Heron, \" have you shelter here, that many curious eyes may not see ? Ah, no ! I see you have not.\" \" What do you want ?\" asked the old woman ; and by the way in which she put ber right hand to her hear he saw that she '.-a\u00ab deaf. CHAPTER CXXXL CAPTAIN HERON FINDS A REFUGE FOE DAISY, AND DISAPPOINTS JONATHAN WILD. A lond sbont from Jonathan Wild at tbat moment, sonnded in Heron's ears, and he drew Daisy after him into the cottage and closed the door. Still Daisy plunged onward. The disposition to lie down and sleep was, no donbt, strong upon the noble horse, but she re sisted it, and still carried the master she loved. Alas, poor Daisy ! About a quarter of a mUe in advance there was a wood. If ho could only get there Felix Heron thought he might be safe. Surely, amid its intricacies, he might be able to hide himself from their presence, and perchance, hide Daisy too. The old woman stepped back with amazement as man and horse, in this manner, invaded ber humble home; and then Heron, with his hand still on the bridle, put his mouth olose to her ear, as he cried, \" I am pursued by bad men, who seek my life ! Will you try to save me ?\" \" What bad men ?\" \"Jonathan Wild is one of them.\" At this name the old woman uttered a scream of dismay, and sunk on her knees to the floor of the cottage. But the hope was fallacious, for as he neared the wood Fel.x Heron saw that there was daylight through the trees, and that they were thinly scat tered, and limited in quantity. It was quite clear that although the spot was a woody one, and very well for a place iu which to make a bolt for defensive purposes, it was no re fuge. Fright seemed now not only to deprive her ef all power of speech, bnt also of the little sense of hearing that was left to her ; and although Hercs repeatedly spoke to her, he could get no oonnected reply. \" Be it so, then,\" he said, at last, \u2014 \" be it so! I will confront my foes here, and they shall assail me only in front.\" As he spoke, he led Daisy into the little ki'chen at the back of tbe cottage, and tbe moment D.i*y got there she let her feet double up under her, aud sinking on to her i-ide, fell into a profound sleep. A window of the little room of the cottage \u2014 a small latticed window it was \u2014 looked into the deep dyke at the ba k, with all its luxuriant vege tation. And what could he hope to do, against Jonathan Wild and the strong force with him ? True, he might take two lives with his pistol, and possibly a third in tbe melee that would ensue, but still, that would leave a force opposed to him that no single arm conld resist. \"Yes,\" said Heron again to himself, \" I am lost- May heaven, my Edith, take you into its special care, for I shall no longer be iu this world to aid yon !\" It was the firm conviction of Heron that Jonathan Wild sought his life. An idea, which was only on the instant bads formed and half approved by Felix Heron, darted into bis mind, but he carried it out instantly. He stripped off the red coat which the hun'.o man bad lent him, and cast it down the deep ex cavation from the cottage window. He then flung the whipper-in's cap after the coat And now that Daisy was no longer what she had been, he felt that his existence hung only upon some possible .ooident that might save it. The spot wt__ a desolate one ! Tho road, narrow and tortuous, wound round by the side of tha little wood, and on the other side there was so deep a depression of the country that xz one part it had all the aspect of a pit Fnrze-buahes and dwarf trees grew there in abundance ; and, iu truth, in olden times, the ground had been excavated for some purpose, whioh accounted for the vegetation. Natural dykes or hoUows are seldom thickly wooded. It was chance \u2014 if there be such a thing as chance \u2014 aud perhaps it was providence that \u00bb.o ordered it\u2014 but the coat fell upon some bushes iu the exact shape and way to represent a bumaia form in the rank vegetation of the hollow. The cap, too, fell so as to adapt itself to the coat. The delusion was perfect. It was eo perfect that it struck even Heron himself with surprise ; aud as the bushes moved slightly with some influence given to them by tba moving air, if be had not known to tbe contrary, he woutd have stood by that cottage window aud declared, by all that was sacred, his belief that a living man was deep down among tbe bushes in a scarlet coat and a hunting-cap. Jonathan WUd and his party rode up to the cottage almost instantly. \" Keep him in sight !\" he shouted. \" You can't be off seeing him ou the next hill. His horse fails him, and he is over. Hilloa ! hilloa ! house here ! who lives here ? Have you a drop of brandy in the house, and I will pay you for it in gold?\" In artificial ones, a luxuriant vegetation is fre quently developed. Olose to the verge of the road and the deep hollow there stood a little whitewashed cottage. \"A very hnmble abode it was, with only one room in the front and another in tbe back. A cloud of thin blue smoke came from the one chimney vhich projected abont a foot from the thatched roof. Felix Heron bod dismounted from the back of poor Daisy, and was leading her by the bridle, for, by the efforts she evidently had to make to keep her feet at all , he did not consider that it was at all r;lo for him to ride."], [351, "345 EDITH HERON As be spoke, Jonathan pushed open the ctittage \" Silence bag door. \" Yes, hag ! You call me hag !\" \"I thought you dead!\" \"And wished it\" The Id woman was still on her knees, and, at sight of him, she uttered shriek upon skriek, and pronounced his name. Wild recoUed, as though something had stung him. \"No.\" M ] say yrs, yes ! Bat I live, fcad I will not tefei you where tbe gold is, Jonathan.\" 14 1 dou't come about it,\" __aid Wild, with a sneer* \" I oan make more gold in a day than all it comes to. When I a-ktd you for it, I did not know wha. I was. I know now, and laugh at your paltry secret hoard of fifty guineas. Ha ! ha !\" \" Ever the same I ever the same !\" muttered tho old woman ; \" a icofter and a mocker.\" \"What? Who? You here?\" \" Yes, Jonathan, yea I am here- J, your poor, wretched, wretched mother!\" Wild folded his arms, aod recoiled a st.p, and a deep groan came from his lip?. T^e old woman lifted one arm, and in shrieking accents spoke to him. *4 Again \u2014 again have you come to strike me, to fell me to the earth, because I will not tell you where the gold was hidden for yonr poor brother, should he ever come back from the deep _e\u00bb, in life !

Jonathan Wild fired again ; and this time t_u\u00bb coat collapsed, and the hat sank lower still. \" Good day, for once and for ever, to my Lord of Whitcombe !\" said WUd. \" AH I shall have to do now will be to attack Epping Forest, and dis perse the band ! Ha ! ha I The fair Edith is a charming widow; I will propose to her! She may as weU be the ninth Mrs. WUd I\" Jonathan was quite satisfied, in his own mind, that he had killed Captain Heron. He went into the middle of the road, and mounted his horse. \" I have none.\" \" You have, I say. Ha ! ha ! Your son Johnny 3 ,n't come to see yon so often, that whan he does jou should refuse him a glass of spirits.\" \" Hence ! avaunt fiend ! wretoh I\" Wild rai'ed his hand. The old woman shrieked. \" What's the use \u2014 what's the use ?\" he said. \" Let her raU on. Words break no bones.\" \"Mr. WUd!

They will, no doubt, find Heron's horse, Daisy, asleep somewhere on the roadside. If so, tell them to get her up and into some stable when they can ; she will be as weU as ever by about midnight, for she has only had some ot Rumsey's drops. When she gets up she is to be brought to me in town.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild !\" \" Ha ! ha ! Captain Heron killed, and Daisy captured, are two pieces of luck in one day that a man could hardly bave looked for !\" As he spoke, Jonathan Wild struck spurs into his horse, and galloped back on the London road. Jonathan dashed out of the cottage. \"If you please, Mr. Wild, one feUow is down in the hole there.\" \" Ah 1\" Wild stood upon the edge of the deep declivity, and bis eyes fell upon the coat and the cap, that were so well associated together. \"Yes!\" he cried; \"he is there, and thinks we don't see him. Ha! ha! It reminds me of what traveller's tell of the hunted estrioh, which hides its head iu a bush, and shuts its eyes, thinking that then the hunters cannot see it Keep quiet, on yonr life, Arnold I Hush !\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Where are the ethers ?\" Captain Heron, from his retreat in the back room of the cottage, heard quite diotinctly every word tbat Wild uttered, and he was so delighted at the explanation of Daisy's seeming trance, that he could almost have ran out and thanked Jonathan for the information. \" Gone forward on the road, Mr. WUd.\" \"Good. Tbey will find the boree, which no doubt he has abandoned, finding there was uo go in it\" Wild carefully examined the priming of one of his pistols, and aejiwed the flint. He took a good aim at the coat and tbe hat down in the hollow. The clatter of Wild's horse's feet, as the villain went towards London, soon died away, and once more Felix Heron was alone in the cottage, with Jonathan Wild's mother. Most sincerely did Heron pity the poor woman for having such a eon. He could not, however, be said to feel perfectly safe, and at ease, while so strong a party of WUd's janissaries were in the neighbourhood, and he re solved to lie in secret untU they had passed the cottage again on their road to town. It was a fnll hour before Heron heard tbe sound of tho horses' feet returning from tha country. \" If I miss that,\" he muttered, \"my right hand, and both my eyes, have lost their Bi-ill and cunning\" The discharge of the pistol soUowed on the instant. Tbe puff of white smoke blew on one side, and then Wild saw that the red coat bad almost dis appeared among the bushes. A strange, faint cry came np from the hollow. That was the death-scream of a leveret which Wild's pistol-bullet had accidentally hit ; for the hollow was quite a warren for hares, and you conld scarcely have sent a bullet down without hitting one. \" It is done !\" said Wild ; \" that was a last gasp \u2014 a death cry I The bullet is in his heart 1 What are you shaking and looking so white-gUled about \u2014eh, fool?\" \"Oh, nothing, Mr. WUd I You \u2014 you have hit him!\" The janissaries were all talking together now that the restraint of WUd's presence was removed. \" What's the use,\" cried several, \u2014 \" what's the use, Arnold ? We can't rind the mare.\" \" Well, please yourselves ; bnt Mr. Wild said she would be on the road-side asleep.\" \"Oh stuff\u2014 stuff ! We have been a good soven miles on the trot, and seven back, and we oan't see her.\" \" OE courpo I bave !\" g \" but how are we to get him np?\" \" Nohow !\" The voices died away, and then Heron felt satis fied that he had, for that time, escaped Jonathan Wild, and by little short of a miracle in hid favour. \" Do you think, Mr. WUd, of letUng him stay down there, then ?\" \"I do!\" \"But he may not be quite dead 1\" \" What's that to me ?\" He gave but one more glance at the slumbering D.isy, and then stepped out into the front room of the cottage. Wild's mother lay on the floor in a swoon. FeUx Heron gently raised her, and placed her upon a bed that was in one corner covered with its old patch-work quilt, and tben he looked about for some water to da..h upon her faoe. \" And it's almost like \u2014 like \" \" Like what, idiot ?\" \" Wilful murder, as he wasn't resisting I\" \" You bad better say as much when we get to town, and see how long you will last after next sessions ; or perhaps I may accommodate you this one!\" \" Oh, no, Mr. Wild\u2014 oh, no : I don't want to tay anything at all !\" \" That's wise ; but for fear you should have any idea that he may be left to suffer, I wiU give him jother shotl\" The poor woman opened her eyes, and sighed deeply, and then burst into tears- \" Cheer up !\" said Heron ; \" he is gone.\" \"Jonathan?\" \" Yes, your son if he be suoh. Are you quite"], [353, "EDITH HERON. 347 snre that such is the relation he bears to yoa?\" \" Alas, yes I he is indeed my 6on.\" \" Then, in truth, I pity you ; but I have the favonr to ask of you that you will let me be your gue\u00bbt tiU midnight?\" \" Who are you ?\" \"Stop. You were deaf a little whUe ago, and now you hear me quite well.\" \"Was I? Oh, pray for me!\" Felix Heron drew aside a little curtain of faded green stuff that was over the cottage window, and let the light if day shine in npon the old woman. And there, then, we must for a brief space of time leave Felix Heron with the dead mother ol Jonathan Wild, and the still slumbering Daisy, whUe we proceed with the reader to Epping Forest, where certain things had taken place in which Edith was most deeply interested. I twill be recollected that tbe Uttle confidential discourse that had taken place between Ogle and Heron, beneath the shadow of the old trees in the forest, had had a listener in the person of John Tarleton. That unscrupulous viUain, still presuming upon his close relationship to Edith, was wUUng to sacrifice her and all she held dear in the world- One glance in her face was enough. Death, it was evident, had there set his seal. The shock of the sudden presence of Jonathan Wild had been too much for her. Her hours, nay, perhaps, her minutes, were numbered. Felix Heron spoke kindly to her. \" Can I do anything for yon ? Only say any thing you would wish, and I wiU do it with pleasure.\" The old woman filled the air with her howls \u2014 her sight had gone. She gasped once or twice, and then it was with startling plainness that sho said suddenly, \" God bless you '.\" With those words her last breath passed away, and Felix Heron was alone in that cottage with the dead. John Tarleton could never bring him_-elf now to think, after what had passed, tbat Felix Heron wonld ever take bis life, therefore he looked upon himself as chartered, so to speak, to commit any iniquity that came in his way, with an impunity that was the principal inducement. Hence be had lent himself to the designs cf Jonathan Wild and Lord Warringdale to that extent that the reader mnst now look upon him as their unscrupulous agent The agreement that had been come to between WUd and Warringdale, in relation to the Whit combe estates, which was to the effect that Wild was to have the property and Warringdale the title, was one, that for the present suited them both perfectly weU, whatever might be the effect of it. \" Best in peace!\" he said, as he genUy covered the patch-work quUt over the face of the old woman. But now we have to do with John Tarleton, who, having overheard what had passed between Ogle and Captain Heron, let h'mself drop from the tree where he had been concealed, in order that he might make use of it \" Capital !\" he said \" I rather fancy now tbat I am in luck's way. That fellow, Felix Heron, the sight of whom makes me quite ill wilh fright, will be away in London for some time, and pos sibly he may be nabbed and tucked up comfortably at the old tree at Tyburn.\" John Tarleton rubbed his hands together wilh delight at 'his supposition. It was, in truth, a strange combination of cir cumstances that had brought about the fact, that he. Felix Heron, should be performing the last office of humanity to the dead mother of his great foe, Jonathan Wild. CHAPTER CXXXIL THE READER IS CONDUCTED TO EPPING FOREST, WHICH IS EKSET EY THE FOES OF EDITH AND CAPTAIN HERON. \" Why,\" he added, \" in that case EJith would be a widow and the Countess of Whitcombe, and I ought to stay by her ? Oh, to be sure, I should get ever so much more by seeming to side with her, than I can ever hope for from Jonathan Wild, or my Lord Warringdale ! John, John, you must keep your eyes open for yonr own interest\" As he spoke, John Tarleton wandered slowly among the old trees of the forest ; but he was timid of making any approaches towards the centre of the wood, until he had given time to Heron to get sufficiently far on his road that he could not ba readily called back or overtaken. With this idea, then, John Tarleton took good eare to keep at the outskirts ot the wood for about an hour or more, and then he resolved upon a bold otroke. The situation of Captain Heron was still perilous, and would be so, as long as Daisy continued in tbat strange lethargic state, that had come over her in consequence of the potion that had been administered by the ostler at the inn in St Martin's-le-Grand. He, Heron, felt that his best chance of extrac tion from the dilemma in which be now wa., wonld be in remaining an inmate of the cottage until Daisy should be fit for the road again. There was nothing there to harm him. Captain Heron was not one of those who had any superstition for the dead, so that a short stay in that cottage was only so far annoying to Cap tain Heron, in so far as it had the effect of pre venting him from proceeding directly to Epping Forest. Bnt to attempt to do so without Daisy would be worse than madness. He had no resource but to wait where he was until his faithful steed would be ready for the road again. The day was now advancing, and Heron felt the minutes lag slowly along. He sat amid the sUence and solitude of that little old cottage, and -carefully reloaded and fresh primed his pistols, for he knew not yet what dangers he might have to encounter. \"Now for it !\" he said. \" I know the password, and I think I shall be able to get at Edith. And if I do, why at the least I shaU get some money out of her \" John Tarleton, as the reader weU knows, was a desperate coward, and although he had every reason iu the world to think that the password he had overheard, would keep him in safety in Epping Forest, yet he felt at the same time that it woa possible hostile eyes were npon him. For all he knew, some of Captain Heron's men nii^ht take it in their heads that the shortest way to \"get rid of him, as he was a stranger in th . wood, would be to put a bullet into his brain a>"], [354, "348 EDITH HERON. \" One hour ago, ou the road to Londou. Oh, you don't kuow the Captain 80 well as I do.\" \" Dou't I ?\" tie strolled along under tbe shadows of the old trees. John Tarleton, after a while, therefore, became as impatient v> meet some one of whom he might claim protection, as under other oircamstauces he would have been anxious to avoid Heron's men. \" No, that you don't ; for he and I are relations ; and we have had a kind of settlement, you see, of all our little differences; and he told me to come here and see the Lady Edith and the little one.\" Ogle shook bil head. \" Shall we tuck the rascal np at once, Mr. Ogle?\" asked the scout \" Yes \u2014 in a few seconds. Let me see.\" It was on turning the corner of some dense thicket then, that be heard a voice apparently high up in the air, speak to him. \" Who goes there?\" \" I !\" said John Tarleton, sharply. \" I\u2014 hawks \u2014 herons No, that's not it \u2014 yes it is ! Hoi ! I am a friend of Captain Heron \" \"Stop!\" \" Stop? What do you mean, man?\" \" Stop where you & re !\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 yes, I will. I am as still as a mouse. I want to speak to a man of the name of Ogle.\" \" That you will soon do 1\" The scout who had questioned John Tarleton, let himse)f drop on the soft turf from a large chesnut tree. Ogle put on a look of consideration, and then turning abruptly to John Tarleton, he said, \" You saw the Captain, you say, within the last hour or so, on the London road ?\" \" I did.\" \" Oh, well \u2014 let me think. I wonder if there is any corn in the wood ?\" \" Only an \u2014 a \u2014 corn I\" replied John Tarleton, prompUy. The reader will no doubt recollect that this was the question and answer whioh were to serve as a watohword, and which, when he heard, Ogle was to put faith in as coming directly from Captain Heron himself. So close to Tarleton did be alight, that the intruder raised a cry of alarm, and started off some few paces. Ogle was taken completely by surprise on hearing the sentence in reply from John Tarle ton ; and in order to make assurance doubly sure, and to convince himself that Tarleton had not hit upon the watchwords by aocident, he again said, in a careless manner, \" I wonder, now, if there is any corn in the wood ?\" \" And I reply, only an a-corn !\" said John Tarleton, again. \" It is enongh,\" said Ogle. \" I should think it was, considering that T had those words from the Captain's own mouth.\" It was strictly true that John Tarleton had had those words from Captain Heron's mouth, but not in the way he made Ogle believe. \" Go, Number Eight, I shall not want yon,\" said Ogle. \" And is he not to be locked up, Mr. Ogle ?\" \" Not at present.\" \" What a pity Why there is rogue and death in every look of him, I can see.\" Number Eight went grumbUngly away, and then Ogle turned to Tarleton, as he said, \" It is not for me to question what the Captain chooses to do and who he chooses to hire. Yon bring me the watchword, and I am bound - to believe in you. What do you want?\" \" The Lady Edith.\" Ogle shook his head. M I have a message for her whioh must only be told to herself.\" \" Not yet,\" said the soont \" Another step, and you are a dead man !\" \" I \u2014 I won't move !\" \" You had better not You are in the midst of the pitfalls.\" \"The\u2014 a\u2014 pitfalls?\" \" Yes. This part of the forest has its traps and you might have fallen into one of them, in which ease good-bye to yon!\" \" Good-bye ?\" \" Yes ; that would have been it\" \" You mean good evening ?\" \"No, good night, as we say to a fellow when be breathes his last breath. What's the matter now \u2014 eh ?\" The scout had dexterously wound a stout cord about the arms of John Tarleton, and brought his elbows together behind his back with a jerk that was not pleasant. \" What have I done that I should be pinioned in this fashion ?\" \" Nothing that I know of ; but when you see Mr. Ogle he may order you to be bung; and therefore \" \" Hung \u2014 hung ?\" \" Oh, only up to dry, that's all. Come on \u2014 come on !\" John Tarleton was in a fright: he began to repent now that he had embarked in snch au adventure, and to think that he was probably in more danger, iu the absence of Captain Heron, than if he had been in tbe forest Ogle paced too and fro for a few moments iu tilence. His suspicions, that John Tarleton was there, in Epping Forest, upon some infamous errand, were too strong to get rid of ; and yet he had brought the exact watchword from Captain Heron, which he, Ogle, was bound to credit. What could he do then but reluctantly pnt faith in Tarleton, or at all events square hie actions in regard to him as though he dia so. \" I have no discretion iu this matter,\" said Ogle, after a rather long pause. \" Follow me !\" '\u2022 Exactly, but don't it seem to you, my fine fellow, a little odd that the confidential friend and brot er-in-law of Cap*ain Heron should have bis two elbows tied together as ii he were trussed for cooking.\" \" There, there!\" O^le took off the cord. But escape was out of the question. He had commenced an adventure which he must go on with, aud he strove to muster up as much nerve as he could to do so. \" Oh, U's all right,\" he said ; \" I shall be de- Ughted to see Mr. Ogle \u2014 quite delighted I\" \" Then here he is,\" said a voice. A slide was then taken from before a dark lantern, and John Tarleton found himseU in the presence of Ogle. \"Now, sir, who and what are yon? Ah! I see that I need not ask such a question. I kuow you, and know you for a vitlaiu ! Number Eight tang this feUow 1\" \"No.no! On yonr life, no! C.ptiin Heron Himself assured me of safety.\" \" When ?\" \" Ab, that's something like.

What shall I call you then to please yen.\" \" Nothing at all !\" \" Oh very well, I am snre I don't want, but I was going to say that as it was a sharp rub to knock my hat down to where it is, it will be simply impossible to get it baok again.\" \"You think so?\" But the suspicion that still something was amiss, was so strong in the mind of Ogle, that he wonld not conduct John Tarleton by any of the eocret routes. \"Wby?\" \" My no6e !\" John Tarleton uttered a shout, as Ogle, by main force pulled off the hat almost dragging his nose with it On the contrary, he led him through the bushes to the great detriment of John Tarleton's ap parel, and at the expense of sundry long scratches, which the winding branches of the brambles inflicted npon him. Then Ogle paused and spoke. \" If yon had fifty passwords, and if I had seen and heard the Oaptain give them to you, I would not, in his absence, take you a step farther, except you were blindfolded.\" \" But, my fine feUow.\" \" Remonstrances are useless. Yon mnst snbmit to that process, or you may leave the forest and I will take all the blame, if there be any, with the Captain.\" * How provoking. Well, weU. But bear in mind one thing, my fine feHow.\" \" Stop.\" \" What is it ? \"Murder! Murder! Confound yon, you ugly villain, you have nearly kUled me.\" \" Bravo 1\" said Ogle. \" What do you mean, yon vagabond, by bravo, eh?\" \" I mean that I prefer your abuse to any other form of expression. Now stay where you are, and I will inform the Lady Elith that you are waiting to see her.\" \" Do so, and say that I have a message from Captain Heron.\" Ogle left John Tarleton where he was, but be came bock after going a few paces, and said care lessly. \" Perhaps I ought to warn you.\" \" Of what ?\" \"If you caU me your fine feUow again, I wUl knock your head off.\" \" Oh, Lord ! I won't \u2014 I won't I \u2014 I was only going to say that here was my own handkerchief, and you might put it over my eyes.\" \" That's better,\" said Ogle. \"Oh! oh! my nose I Help! Murder! Fnff, f uff ! I can't see a bit\" \" That if yon move to tbe left you wUl go down a hole, and if to the right you wiU be instantly shot.\" \" Good gracious, what a murdering place this is,\" said John Tarleton, to himself. Ogle was absent about ten minutes, and then John Tarleton, in the darkness, saw the dim out line of some figures approaching, and ha was sud denly startled by the voice of his sister, Edith. \" What is it that one so little deserving the con fidence of my husband, has to say to me.\" \"Oh, is that you, Edith?\" \" Answer. You know well that it is I.\" \" I did not intend you should,\" said Ogle, wbo with the flat of his hand, had hit tbe rather tall sugar-loaf shaped hat that John Tarleton wore on his crown, and tied it at once right down to his chin. No doubt the process of blindfolding in that way was rather a rough one but it was perfectly effectual. \" Wall, then, are you alone ?\" \" No.\" If John Tarleton's head had been in a thick bag he could not have more completely been in the dark. \" Then it won't do !\" \"What won't do?\" \" For me to say what I have to say, and which the Captain told me I was only to communicate to you alone ; so, if you won't hear it the fate of your child be npon yonr head, and I will go away at once.\" \"Now come on,\" added Ogle. He took hold of John Tarleton by the collar and led him along. The fact was, that they had reached one of the little narrow paths that led directly to the part of the Old Priory ruins which were in the occu pation of Edith. This path was not above two feet in width, and the bushes on each side of it were so managed, that some of them right and left could be moved forward so as completely to stop up the path. \"My child?\" \" I said so.\" \" My little one ? Oh, heaven !\" \" Just so.\" \" Ogle and you, dear friends, retire a whUe, and let me listen to this man. He is my brother, but I know him too well to put faith in him. He is as false as any human mind and heart fuU both of wickedness, oan be.\" A few cut branohes then from the bramble bushes and the nnt trees, would rapidly make the narrow route impervious, and at the same time give it the appearance of being natnraUy so, from the thick undergrowth of the forest vege tation. CHAPTER CXXXIII. \"Halt!\" said Ogle. John Tarleton stopped. He spoke in a hollow voice from the hat, as thongh he had been at the bottom of a well. \"It's aU very fine my \u2014 hum! I mean my friend, it's all very well.\" \"Stop!\" JOHN TARLETON ALARMS EDITH, AMD OGLE SENDS A NOTE OF WARNING TO CAPTAIN HEBON.

He said, I cannot believe that nature is so dead within your breast, that you have no affection for EJith; and I said it was not; and then he said that be would give me a watchword, that wonld take me into the Forest, and that I was to see you, and say that, if he sent a man here, who would say he came from the moon, you were to do j ust as he tells you.\" \" Well ?\" \" You viUain,\" added tbe voice, whioh was evidently that of a female, but not at all like Edith's, \u2014 \" yon villian, you shall have a real box en the ears it you dare to lay hands upon me.\" \" A real box on the ears,\" gasped John Tarleton. \" What would that be when 1 shall not get the better of the sham one for a week\" \"Will you be off?\" \" Yes, yes.

John Tarleton ran on till he was stopped by the bushes, and then be felt himself seized by the arm, and the voice of Ogle sounded in his ears. \" Fool, do you fancy you can leave this wood without a guide ?\" \" No. Perhaps not.\" \" Come this way !\" Ogle led him by another route, nearly to tho middle of one of the forest glades, and then he proceeded, saying \" You have but to go straight on, and you wUl get clear of Epping Forest, and the sooner you do so the better it wUl be for you.\" \" Oh, I don't want to stay, but it is just likely that somebody may come, and want to speak to Edith, and if he does it will be from the Captain, and he will say that he comes from the moon I Good night\" Ogle made no answer, but he gave John Tar leton an admonitory push in the direction in whioh he was to go. When Ogle was alone he paced the green sward in deep thought. \" What does all this mean ?\" he asked himself. \" Can it be possible that something has happened, or that Felix Heron sees that something is going to happen, whioh has induced him to seem to trust tbat rascal, John Tarleton, fir trnst him in reality he really cannot. I am uneasy. I wiU send to the Captain and let him know that in my opinion there is danger in the air.\" It was npon this impulse that Ogle sent to London the little note that Captain Heron duly received, warning him that he was wanted at Epping Forest. John Tarleton made his way out of the wood \" That's aU.\" \" And do you think, John, that I am so weak as to be deceived by such a tale ?\" \" 1'faith, I don't think or care about it. You can do as you like ; but I heard the Oaptain add to himself some words.\" \" What words?\" \" As he turned his horse away towards London, be added, 'Yes, that is the only plan to save EJith and the Uttle one !' \" EJith sighed deeply. \" Well, sister, what do you say to that?\" \" Just this, John \u2014 that if you are deceiving me, and if yon are devising, either on your own ac count or as the tool and mouthpiece of others, some gross plot against me and those I love here on earth, as sure as there is a heaven above, you will meet with a terrible retribuUon !\" John Tarleton was frightened. Such natures as his are always amenable to terrors that bave any superstitious or supernatural basis. He shook with fear. \" Editb, Edith I \u2014 you \u2014 that is \u2014 I am so much in want of money.\" \" Takethe6e five guineas.\" \" Five guineas. Oh !\" thought John Tarleton, \" I am to have a hundred down, and a thousand more when my Lord Warringdale gets the title, if I go through with the work.\" This consideration set John Tarleton what he called \" to rights again,\" and he determined to persevere in nil vUlany. \" Well, Edith, you may think as badly of me at you like, but what I tell you is the exact truth\" \" Be it so. There is a heaven above us, wbo in the time tbat is proper and good in its eyes, will judge between me and you, John.\" \" Ob don't go on in that sort of way.

Throngh a gap in the delapidated paling of the honse, John Tarleton made his way, and then he blew a whistle thrice, not loudly, but with a pro- Jonged, low note, which would go far, and reach >ny ears that might be listening for it John Tarleton had not long to wait for an tnswer to his summons. \" Drink, noble Deuce Ace,\" said Le Jenne, \" I see by yonr eyes that yon have something good to tell to ns.\" \" I have. Ah, that's good ! Prime Spanish wine I\" \" The best\" \"Another glass, if yon please.\" \" Quick 1\" said Warringdale impatiently. \" Am I to wait until you have muddled your brains with wine before I hear what you have to say ?\" \"No, no, my lord, not so. I will tell your lordship at once. Hem ? After incredible dan ger.\" _ Lord Warringdale made a gesture of impa tience. \" I do not want to hear or do I care what trials you have passed throngh. They wUl not in any degree enhance your reward.\" \" Hem ! Well, my lord, to come to the point then, I have seen the Lady Edith, as they oaU her there.\" There was the flash of a lantern among the old trees, that for want of topping and training had grown so low in the garden that some of the branches traUed npon the ground. \" Who goes there?\" asked a gruff voice. \"Number three!\" replied John Tarleton. \" Oh, ah\u2014 that's right This way.\" John Tarleton soUowed the light of the lantern and entered the ancient door-way of the house. The once bright marble steps were covered with green stains, and moss filled np every crevice. The haU door was closed, but the man with the lantern stood by the side of one of the open win dows on the ground floor, and held up his lantern. \" That's the way. Your honour wUl find them both in the little room at the back.\" \" Bah 1\" \" WeU, I don't call her that of course, but as I say, I have seen her and thoroughly frightened her.\" \" Is she go easily alarmed ?\" \" Yes, at one thing.\" \"And that I\" \" Is at anything amiss with her beloved Felix. I have made her think that he is in some peril, and that he will send a man to the wood with a watchword that shaU bespeak her confidence to tell her what to do.\" \"All right!\" replied John Tarleton, and he stepped into the house. \" Show me the Ught inside a moment,\" he said. \" Who the deuce is to see his way. It's Uke a cavern.\" \" And has she fallen into the snare ?\" \" I think she has.\" \" Then she is weaker than I thought her.\" \" We are aU weak,\" said Le Jeune with a cold \" What's that ?\" asked another voice, and a door was flung open, through which streamed a faint radiance from another lantern which was on a chain hoisted to the centre of a staple. sneering smUe. \" We are all weak when we are appealed to throngh our affections.\" \" Be it so. Go on, Deuce Ace.\" \" Well, my lord, yon know pretty well all I have done my part, and it is the time now for Captain Target to do his.\" \" What is it to do ?\" asked Le Jeune. \" Oh, it's aU right, Captain Target.\" \"Deuce Ace!\" cried the voice. \"The Dence Ace, my lord.\" The reader wUl no doubt recollect that the name, Captain Target, was the one assumed by the ras- cally Le Jenne in his various gambling transac- tions, and that John Tarleton was known in the same quarter by the name of Deuce Ace. The \"my lord,\" that Le Jenne addressed, was Lord Warringdale. Seated by that table with a brace of pistols be- fore him, and richly dressed, with a sword by his side, was Lord Warringdale. Apprehension was upon his face, and he looked very pale. The enterprise that he was on, being noce other than the capture of Edith and her chUd, he felt to be fraught with danger. And yet he was acting upon the fixed advice of Jonathan Wild, and he conld not but himself feel that if anything in the world would bring, or force, Felix Heron to some terms that would an- swer his (Warringdale's) purpose, it would be the japture of Edith and her presumed danger along wilh the little child. The plan was as base as it was weU connived and arranged. \" Welcome, John Tarleton, alias Deuce Ace,\" laid Warringdale, \" What news do you bring?\" \" The best my lord.\" \" Ah, that's well !\" \" But I am uncommonly thirsty.\" John Tarleton had caught sight of a couple of black bottles and some tall glasses on tbe table. \"AU you will have to do is to go to the forest, and when you are introduced to a fellow of the name of Ogle, he wiU say to yon, 'Is there any corn in the wood ?' to which you wiU reply, ' Only an a- corn.' and then you will ask to see tbe Lady EJith, and she will see you if you send word that you oome from the moon.\" \"It seems to me, Deuce Ace,\" said Lord Waringdale, not without a certain swell in his tone, \"that you have managed all this quite wonderfully well.\" \" I hope so, my Lord.\" \" Oh, I'm sure of it \" \" And I am ready to manage any part of it,\" said Le Jeune, as he rose. As the seoretary who had once been ac inmate of Captain Heron's house, and who had during that time done so muoh evU, rose, he reached to his hand a smaU leathern vaUse, which open- ing, he took from it a wig of grey hair, that he carefully fitted to his head, so that it should cover aU his natural hair. Then from a small glass stoppered vial he took a few grains of some powder into the palms of his hand, and rubbed it over his face, and the effect was to alter the complexion to ft look of old age. \" Now,\" he said, as he buttoned his coat np to the ohin, only letting the ends of his cravat ba visible above it ; \" now I am ready.\" He took a walking-stick from a corner of the"], [358, "352 EDITH HERON.

Lord Warringdale took a watch from his pocket, and having glanced at it, he replied, \" It is nearly two\" \"Then Mr. Wild ought to behere\" A tap was heard at .the window at this moment, and upon Le Jeune proceeding to it to know what it was he found one of Jonathan WUd's men, with a note for Lord Warringdale. \"Speak further,\" he said ; \"have you no word to me to let me know yon come from one who is master here I\" \" Yos, from Captain Heron.\" \"What is it?\" \" Ask you first\" \" Nay, yon ought to do so ; I might as weU ex pect corn to be found in the wood \" \" If you did,\" replied Le Jeune, \" you would not find anything but an a-corn I\" \" E nough !\" said Ogle. \" Follow mo.\" Le Jeune smUed to himself. The note was to the foUowing effect : \u2014 \" Mt Lobd, \"If by fraud, the fair Edith and the child can be secured, do so, but if not, use no violence till I come, as I am better at that than yonr lord sh'p. Ogle led him by the same ronte he had led John Tarleton, and he stopped with him at the same spot \"Jonathan Wild \" P.S. \u2014 If you get her, keep her at Oak House till I can come to yon. I am busy.\" Then Ogle spoke. \" I do not know who or what you are, but you had far better borrow a rope of me, which I wUl with pleasure lend you, and hang yourself on one of the trees, than continue what you are about if there be deceit in it\" \" Enough,\" said Warringdale, with some emo tion ; \" we shall not have Wild here to night \" Both Le Jeune and John Tarleton looked rather black at this information, but Warringdale then spoke again. \" It must be tried tonight; Heron is absent, and by the accounts of Deuce Ace, it seems that they are open to some deception in the Forest Try it, I say, at once.\" \" I will,\" said Le Jeune, \" Deuce Ace, remember that I go relying upon the information you have given to me.\" \" You may do so, and my idea is that you will have no difficulty iu getting Edith on the road to London.\" Le Jenne was much more a master both of words and of thoughts than John Tarleton, and he re plied with some force. \" It is not for a man like you to judge of the actions of your superiors, and to suspect lala hood merely beoause your own life has been, and is still, one that is contrary to the commonest principles of honesty.\" \" Very good,\" said Ogle. \" I have warned you.\" \" And I warn you.\" \" That's right\" \" That you will find your way to Tyburn.\" \"Perhaps. But with all yonr boasting if I find you are not what you pretend I will find the stout limb of a tree to hang you on, without wait ing at all for Tyburn. Now stay where you are, and I will speak to the La ly Elith.\" \"Confound the fellow,\" muttered Le Jeune to himself, \" I wonld not have him find me out so.' a trifle.\" \" If so, she is onrs,\" said Warringdale ; \" but be sure you specify that she is to bring with her but one person, and that person is not to be tbe man 0(_.te, who Wild tells me is as strong as a fortress.\" Le Jeune waved his band, as much as to say that he knew well what he was about, and then left tbe deserted mansion. It was daylight by the time Le Jenne entered Epping Forest But although the dawn had made such progress tbat it might be called daylight in the open coun try, it was still but a dim twilight, that made ob jects partially visible beneath the branches of the old trees of Epping Forest Le Jeune had more courage than John Tarle ton, but still he could not conceal from himself that he was on a perilous enterprise. Iu abont five minutes, lighted by the Rav. Mortification Ripon, and Mr. Ogle, Edith appeared before Le Jeune. \" Alone, lady,\" said Le Jeune, \" alone only, can I deliver to you the message your husband has sent to you \" \" Then,\" said Edith, \" I cannot hear it, for I will give no meetings alone to those I know not.\" \"Be it so. FareweU!\" Hardly had he set foot in the wood than he was challenged by one of the sconts. \" Stand, oh, stand 1 who goes there .'\" \" A friend to Captain Heron.\" The soout dropped from the tree which was his post of observation, at the feet of Le Jeune. \" Who do yon search in the forest?\" \" The Lady Edith.\" \" By what token ?\" \" I must see one named Ogle, and to him I will give the word.\" \" This way then.\" The scout led Le Jeune into an enolosure close at hand, where some thickets grew in a kind of curl, and then he imitated the cry of an owl. \"To whoo! to whoo! to whoo!'' \"Farewell!\" \" Number Two !\" cried Ogle, \"see this man olear of the wood.\" Le Jeune had not the remotest intention of reaUy leaving in such a fashion.

But it was not sean, and the crafty Lo Jeune was able, in those few seconds of silence, suffi ciently to command his feelings to leave his judg ment dear enough for action. \" Be it eo,\" he said, \" I will stay.\" \" It is wisely resolved,\" replied Ogle. \" I like to see a man make up his mind to what be cannot help\" \" Ye\u00bb, and so do I,\" added Mortification. \" Lady Edith,\" he then said, \" I have a great favour to ask of yon \" \"No! no!

As Ogle reached a little open space where a couple of the baud now watched, he spoke to them both seriously. \" lie mindful now of what I say, and let all the men know. By turns, aU who are not on scout duty are to take it, two and two, to watch that man .v ho came with the message from the Cap tain\" \" Ah, yes I\" exclaimed Ogle, as he laid hia hand on the shoulder of the shrinking Le Jenne, who at this proposition almost sunk into the earth. \" Yes, to bo sure.

StUl a little distrustful in regard to the pretended message of the man who said he had come from Captain Heron, Ogle wanted Tom to foUow the coach, as a spy npon what was going to happen. But there was no time to look for Tom, se Ogle was fain to be content with one of the band. \" Mortification ?\" \" Yea, Mr. Ogle.\" \" Do you know where you are going ?\" \" Yea, I have been told that I am to drive this conveyance even unto the second mile-stone on the London road.\" \" Yes, that is it.\" \"Come np!\" The Rev.

It was then that the Lady Edith uttered a half suppressed scream, for she felt quite certain that some one else was in the coach, beside herseU and the in fant \" Don't ! oh, don't !\" oried a voice. \" Keep quiet do, I beg.

A sense of danger \u2014 a dread of something she knew not what, oppressed her ; and bnt for the supposition that Felix Heron might be in some danger, which she ought to share with him, she would at the last moment have hurried back, and declined the enterprise. The Rev. Mortification suddenly pulled up the horses. \" Yea, did yon speak. I thought as the Psalmist says, ' I saw a voice in the air.'

The explosion in the coach was of the most deafening charaoter ; and the couple of bullets which Tom had loaded his pistols each with rushed past the face of Edith- Lord Warringdale uttered a yeU of pain, and feU. \" All right !\" cried Tom. \" One rogue the less in the world, I fancy 1\" As he spoke, Tom opened the door on the other side of the coach, and leaped out. He ran round the coach by the horses' beads, and then over he went, as he did not notice ihat he came upon the prostrate form of Mortifica tion. Edith drew back from the window of the coach as Tom spoke, and he pointed as weU as the dark ness would let him to the mile-stone by the side of the road. There was nothing particular about the stone as a mile-stone ; but as Tom and Edith looked at it they both saw a dark figure rise np from behind it To Tom's apprehension the appearance bespoke danger immediate and great To Edith the supposition that it was Felix Heron that she saw, was but a natural consequence of the manner in whioh her mind was impressed with the expectation of his presence on that spot \" Ab!\" she cried; \"he is there, and aU is well.\" \"Who? who?\" \" Felix.\" \" Oh, Lor',\" said Tom. \" I can see better than that with half an eye ! That is not the Captain !\" Before Tom could get these words out of his month Edith had been able to take a second glance at the figure , and although she had no idea of who it was, she felt perfecUy certain it was not Felix Heron. At the instant of Tom's faU, Lord Warringdale managed to scramble to his feet calling out as ho did so, \" Help ! help ! A trap ! \u2014 a trap ! Deuce Ace - \u2014 Target, where are you? I am wounded, perhaps to the death!\" Warringdale fled on as rapidly as he could to wards the plantation and old neglected garden of Oak House ; but Tom Ripon thought that while he had his hand in he might as well finish tbe business. \" We are betrayed !\" she said. \" That's like enough !\" said Tom Ripom, as he shrank down in the straw at the bottom of the coach. The figure that had risen up from behind the mile-stone now darted forward to the coach, and, approaching the window next to where Edith sat, it said,' \"You are to send the man Mortification Ripon back to the wood, and I am to eonduct yon to Captain Heron !\" Levelling his other pistol, he sired again after Warringdale; and Tom had the satisfaction u see him roll headlong over the raiUng that be ..a. attempting to cross. \" AU right I\" said Tom; \" I think I had you then, rather, you rascal ! Hooray 1 Hip! \u2014 hip I hip 1 \u2014 hooray I Ob, dear ! \u2014 well, I am sorry I\" Tom's eye fell npon what looked Uke the dead body of the Rev. Mortification. \" Oh, Miss Edith \u2014 I mean, Lady Edith !

I am that Lord Warringdale who, but for you and yonr highway- Edith was at the first terribly alarmed ; but that courage and presence of mind which she had on so many other occasions exhibited, did not desert her now. \" Tom I \u2014 Tom 1\" she cried, \" open the coach door \u2014 I oannot do so with the infant in my arms I"], [363, "bdith heron. 357 Open the coach door, and get, if you can, a light I\" \" That can I ! Bnt don't yon come out Ladv Edith, till I get it!\" Tom Ut a match, and then he succeeded in opening one of the coach lamps, in whioh there was about an inch of wax candle, which, not without some difficulty, he got alight, and even then, it was so covered with dust that it bnrnt badly, and looked as if it shone throngh a fog. Opening, then, the door of tbe coach, Tom stood with it in his hand, as he said, \" Now, Lady Edith, don't you come out, I beg of yon 1 Jnst let me get on the box, and drive yon back to the old forest !\" imply that they were enemies, they could be let go on. Tom Ripon did not pause either to mount the coach-box himself, or to help the Rev. Mortifica tion into that position, bnt he led the horses into the covert by the road-side. The hedgerow was thick and high, and from it, at intervals of abont twenty feet, there shot up into the night air tall trees, the branches of whioh intermingled over-head, in snoh a manner as to make aU that part of the roadway very dim and dusky. As was, and is still, very common in some parts of the country, there existed a donble hedgerow at that spot between which ran a shady path, that was so completely shut in, and overgrown with vegetation, that it was Uke a tunnel of leaves and branches. \" No, no ! not yet ! Poor Mortification may be only wounded. I must see to him. Take ont the lamp from the coach, Tom !\" * Yea 1\" said a voice, \" as the Psalmist says, ' There are ups and downs in this world, and this is, yea, one of the downs 1' \" Tom raised quite a shout of delight when he heard the voice of Mortification \u2014 nor was Edith a bit less pleased than Tom Ripon, although she did not give utterance to her satisfaction in the same fashion. It was into this place that Tom Ripon led the coach and horses. Hardly had the vehicle and the two horses from the forest, that drew it, got well concealed in the lane, than the horsemen, who were three in number, galloped np. \" Halt I\" cried a voice. About that voice there could be no mistake. It was not Felix Heron, and poor Edith had heard it too often before not to know it instantly. It was the voioe of Jonathan WUd. \" All's right !\" cried Tom ; \" I never did think I should be half so glad to hear the voice of old Mortification ! How are you, old boy, eh ?\" \" Yea, Tom, thou art irreverent ! I may be an old boy, but as the Psalmist says \" \"Oh, never mind what he says \u2014 get np!\" \" Yea, I will gather myseU to my feet The man who falls and seems to be dead, escapes another ounce of lead ! Yea, that villain would have fired a second pistol at me, if I had not given him the notion that the first was enough !\" \" Bravo, old 'un ! that's the thing ! Now, Lady Edith, all we have to do, is to get back to the wood as soon as we can, for you see this is a re gular plant I\" \" Yes ! oh, yes ! Back again !\u2014 back again !\" \u00ab Hush !\" \" Halt !\" The two men who were with Jonathan came to a stand-stiU. \" Get down, you Jaskin,\" he added, \" and see if that is the mile-stone we want?\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd. What ought it to have on it, Mr. WUd ?\" \" Six miles to London. Look sharp.\" The man, who was named Jaskin did look sharp, for he almost flung himself off his horse, to oboy Jonathan Wild's order. \" Yes, sir,\" he said, \" this is the mUe-stone \" \" Ah ! that wUl do. Now you two stay here, and keep on each side of the way, in the shadow of the hedgerow.\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" I shaU be back with yon in ten minutes ; bnt if, during that time, anything comes by, in the shape of a coach, stop it\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" Jonathan was in the act of turning his horse's head towards the old, neglected plantations of Oak Mansion, when he heard the short congh of a horse. Tom stood in an attitude of listening. The fast beating of horses' hoofs on the road towards London became evident to them all. \" It is FeUx\u2014 it must be Felix !\" cried Edith. \u25a0* Yea, it is tbat man of war !\" said Mortification ; \" and onr troubles will be over !\" \" I don't know that,\" said Tom ; \" It may be somebody else, and onr troubles may be all abont to begin again.\" The tramp of the horses' feet was about a quarter of a mile off, and as tbe sounds came nearer and nearer each passing second. Tom made up his mind that there was more than one horseman ap proaching. Bome prompt action was indispensable, and he turned to Edith, saying, \" Lady Edith, if that is the C.ptain, he is not alone.\" \" Then it is not Felix.\" \" That's my notion ; and the best possible thing we can do is to get out of the way. Now, here is a kind of donble hedge to this side of the road, and the coach wUl not be seen among the trees.\" \" Yes\u2014 oh, yes, that will do.\" EJith saw that the best thing wonld be to let the horsemen, be they whom they might, gaUop past the spot, and the thought that if one of them should be Felix Heron, that even the dun and transient glance she would be able to get at him as he passed, would be quite sufficient for recog nition, and she could call out to him. If, on the other hand, tbe horsemen were strangers, which, at the same time, wonld a'mos. The sound conld not be mistaken. Wild knew it was not his horse that coughed, and he felt pretty sure it was not the horse of either of bis men. Bending down low in his saddle, he listened intently ; for he thought it very possible a buUet might be the next indication of the presence of some one not in his interest on that darksome spot \" Jaskin !\u2014 Jaskin !\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" \" Did yonr horse cough?\" \"Ne, sir!\" \" Yours, then, Rattles ?\" \u00ab No, Mr. Wild.\" \" Good. Then fire your pistols into that hedge!\" Bang ! bang I went two pistols. The leaves from some of the low- lying branches of the trees that concealed the coach, in whioh were Edith and the child, were scattered about by the shots."], [364, "358 EDITH HERON. Then Tom Ripon spoke earnestly to Edith, as he leant half into the coach. \" Discovery is certain ! What shall we do ?\" \" Save the chUd, and tell Felix not to despair of me !\" hand, with mock respect, and held it a foot above his head, as he said, in warmer tones, \" Lady Edith, I salute you, and am your most obedient, humble servant\" Surely now there is something in fate, and Jona than Wild being reserved for death at Tyburn tree, could not meet it in any other shape. The most extraordinary aooidents ever inter posed as if by the fiat of a special providence, to save the oonsummate villain from the faie that seemed so justly due to his offences \" But\u2014 but, Lady Edith, you don't mean to say that yon will let Wild take yon ?\" \" Yes. It is the only chance for one dearer to me than Ufe itself! If ever yon wished to obey me, and do exactly as I desire yon to do, take the little one now in yonr arms, and conceal yourseU until WUd is gone !\" Tom was mortified. \" Now, what a goose I have been,\" he said. \" I brought a pair of loaded pistols with me, but no more powder and bullets, so that, as I have fired them both off, here I am as helpless as a cat.\" If WUd had not at that instant of time, and on that occasion, raised his hat with the mock re spect that he intended to Edith, he would surely have been a dead man. It happened thus. The Rev. Mortification Ripon had promised Tom that he would have a shot at Wild. \u25a0 Yea,\" said Mortification, \" that am not I ; for I have here a pistol, which, yea, is loaded, even into the muzzle, with powder and small shot\" \" SmaU shot !\" said Tom, with a tone of scorn. \"What is the use of smaU shot to snch game as we hunt I\" The only pistol Mortification had, though, was the one he had spoken of as being merely loade . with powder and small shot for the purpose of shooting the weasels in Epping Forest. But where there is a will there is a way, and Mortification whispered to Tom as they crouched down behind the bushes. \" Yea, I saw a weasel.\" \" A what ?\" \" Yea, Tom, I have a sixpence here, bnt it wUl not go into the barrel of the pistol.\" \" Give it me.\" \" A weasel in the wood, and a longiBg for the skin of the oreatnre oame over me.\" \" Be quiet do.\" \"Ha! ha!\" yelled Jonathan Wild\u2014 and with the riding whip he carried, he commenced fiercely beating the branches of the tree that concealed Edith and the coaoh from him. \" Take it.\" \" There yon are.\" Tom had put the sixpence between his teeth, and by one vigorous wrench had succeeded in turning it into a fluted shape, so that it would easUy pass into the pistol. \" Yea, what hast thou done ? Oh \u2014 ah \u2014 I feel f Yea, it is all right\" \" I hope so. They do say that Jonathan is proof against lead, but perhaps a silver bullet wUl hit him.\" \" Found out !\" said Tom. \" Yea, the Phillistines are upon us !\" said the Rev. Mortification. \" Once more, Tom,\" whispered Editb- \" I com mand you to take the chUd 1\" \" All right !\" * Tom took the little one from the arms of Edith, and he dived down among the brushwood with it. But as he did so, he spoke to Mortification. \" I tell you what it is, daddy in law, if you don't fire that pistol right in the face of Jonathan WUd, I won't acknowledge you any more !\" \" Yea, I wiU.\" \" AU right \u2014 that may do some good, though it's only small shot\" Wild's voice at this moment sounded huskily in the silence of the night. \" Whoever is here hidden in the bushes had best snrrender, or else they may take the chances of the bullets I am about to fire Into them.\" \" Yea, I have heard as much.\" \" Can yon see him ?\" \" No.\" \" Get up a little.\" \" Yea, I will, \u2014 ah, yes ! He is rising from some stooping posture, or, yea, he has been off his horse, and has just mounted, and surely I see his head.\" \" Fire !\" Bang ! went the pistol- Away, at the same instant, flew Jonathan WUd's hat out of his hand, as, for tbat brief space, he held it above his head, in mock respect to Edith. \" Did yon hit him ?\" asked Tom. \" Yea ; his head is off.\" \"No!\" cried Edith, for all her fears were for the child, lest some stray shot should hit it \u2014 \" no, Jonathan WUd, I am here, and I will come forth.\" \" Bravo ! hooray !\" \" Bravo ! hooray !\" bellowed the Rev. Mortifi cation, and he darted out of the hedge into the roadway. \" Oh, indeed !\" said WUd : \" it's yon, is it ?\" Poor Mortification was so thunderstricken to find Wild alive and well, after he had, as he firmly thought seen his head fly off in the night air, that he stood stiU a moment as though paralyzed. \" Jaskin, and you, RatUes I\" shouted Wild, \" look to the lady. This feUow is my game just now I\" \" Ah, say yon so ! A fair prize on a dark night, Edith, or I am much mistaken.\" Edith made her way round the corner of the double hedge, and confronted Jonathan Wild. Just then the moon peeped ont a little, and shone npon her pale, fair, young face, as she looked with abhorrence on tbe man wbo had for so long been the bitter foe of her and her hus band. Wild turned bis horse's head and made a dash at Mortification, who, recovering from the first shock of his surprise, set off at speed for the forest. Mortification was tall and thin, and his legs were long, so that now, actuated by fear, he ran at a tremendous pace. That WUd could overtake him, well mounted as he was, in a two-mUe race, there o-nld be little doubt ; bnt still the speed that Mortification mad* CHAPTER CX2XVI.

Jonathan Wild was provoked ; each bound of his horse was taking him further and further away from Edith, who wa. a mnch more important cap ture than the Rev. Mortification Rpon. At the rate they both went at, Wild would be a good mUe fren the spot where he had left Edith, before he conld come up with the flying Mortifica tion. Edith shrank away as far as she could into the opposite oorner. \" Oh, I am not oontagious,\" he said. \" Come, now, madam, I want a little talk with you. Hoy ! Jaskin ?\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \"You lead both the spare horses, and tellRatUes to get on the coach-box and drive.\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Stop ! stop ! oh, stop ! Murder ! help !\" shouted a man at this momeut, as he scrambled over the paling of the plantation of the dilapidated house. \" Who have we here?\" asked Wild. Uttering, then, a few impreoations, such as only such a man as Wild would indulge in, ho gave up the chase. \" Help ! help 1 He is killed ! He is kffled !\" \"Who, idiot?\" Mortification ran on etiU, at the same pace, tiU he reached the wood. \"My Lord Warringdale!\" \"Ah!\" Then he felt that he wa* safe. \" Yej. Who ai-e you ?

I \u2014 oh 1\" The man who so vociferously spoke of telling all, was John Tarleton, and he reached the side of the coach just as Wild pnt his face out, so ths.t they almost touched e ich other. By that time Jonathan Wild had got back to the two-mUe stone, and it was a weight off his heart to sind that Edith was safe in t .e custody of his two bull-dogs, Jaskin and Rattles. \" Any news ?\" he asked. ' \" None, Mr. Wild, but the sound of a horse coughing again on the other side oi the hedge.\" \" Go and see, ono of you \" One of the bull-doirs went, and the coach and horses were at once discovered, and reported to WUd- \" So,\" said WUd, \" you wiU do that ?\" \" Mr. WUd!\" \" Mr. John Tarleton, alias Deuce Ace, eh ?\" \"Oh! oh!\" \" WeU ?\" \" Good !\" he said. \" Bring them out I think the nest wiU have a younp one in it\" Edith knew well what he meant, and that ho expected to find the ohUd in the coach. Her prajers, at that time, were not for herself, but for Tom Ripon and the precious charge she had given him. \" My Lord Warringdale lies dead.\" \" Where ?\" \" In the hons9 yonder.\" \" Are yon quite sure ?\" \" Quick ! quick ! He has been shot, and he told me ho was a dead man.\" \" That ought to be evidence!\" said Wild. \"It is! it is!\" \" Now for it,\" said Wild, as he opened the coach door. \" Bring a match here. Ah ! \u2014 empty. So, Lady Edith, yon have managed, have you, to leave j onr child at home?\" Edith made no rep'y- \" Well \u2014 one half of the luck expected, is better than none, so I will trouble you to get into the cofeb. again \" Edith shrunk from his touch, as he made a show of helping her into the coach, aud hastily ascended the steps. \" Ob, there's no particular hurry,\" said Wild. \" Your man won't t^e here for some time to come, Ha! ba! ha! And indeed, I rather think, unless he chooses to haunt the road in tbe guise of the ghost of a highwayman, we shall not be troubled with him any more.\" Edith felt her heart cease to beat for a second or two, but she could not speak to Jonathan Wild even on so terribly interesting a topic as that. Jonathan got ont of the coach, and took John Tarleton by the collar. \"Look you here, Mr. Tell All, and Mr. Turn King's Evidence, if you don't hold your noiso, and take me at once to his lordship, I will knock a hole into your skull, that wUl let the first light into ii that ever shone there.\" \"IwUl! IwUl!\" \" Jaskin !\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" See to the safety of the prisoner till I come back. Keep riding round the coach. There is nothing to fear, for Captain Felix Heron is dead, and by this time his famous mare, Daisy, is in the bands of Arnold, for me.\" Edith heard these words, and each one of them plunged like a poisoned arrow into ber heart She could no longer refrain from speaking, and she leant from the coach window, as she said \u2014 His words pointed to the conclusion that Felix Heron was no more, but were the words of such a man as Jonathan Wild to be depended upon? \"Jonathan Wild, Jonathan Wild, I charge you, if you have the least lingering hope of mercy in tbe world to come, to speak the truth !\" \" What is it ?\" \" Felix\u2014 my husband?\" \"Dead!\" Over and over again, Euith told herself that they were not And yet the mere suggeution that never more in Ufe could Felix Heron look upon her was enough to produce a sealing of sickening terror and dismay. \" Oh, you don't feel at all interested in all that !\" said Wild. \" Well, some ladies look forward to being interesting widows, as a natural and desir able part of their lives ; but I can tell you one thing, and thst is that yonr chUd wUl never be Earl of Whitcombe.\" As he spoke, Jonathan Wild dismounted from his horse, aud got into the coach. \"How?\u2014 oh, how?\" \" 1 shot him twice, and his dead body by this time would ba food for carrion, if there were suoh things in England.

If Jonathan Wild had had the least idea tbat Felix Heron was not only al've and well, but in possession still of the gallant Daisy, bis conduct on lhat night would have been very different to what it was. \" I am murdered !\" \" I don't think so!\" But he felt perfectly convinced, in his own mind, that Heron was dead. \" You don't ihink so ?

Lord Warringdale groaned as Jonathan Wild insisted upon getting him on to his feet ; and then, assisted by J^hn Tarleton, they slowly walked him out of the house. The encounter with Wild seemed so com pletely to have overcome John Tarleton that he was reduced to a state of pitiable weakness and fatuity. \" Idiot and coward !\" said Jonathan, as he heard John Tarleton crying. \" What U the matter now ?\" \" What hit you ?\" asked Wild. 41 1 think it was a turbulent boy named Tom Eipon.\" \" Ah I \u2014 my old friend Torn t A clever lad, that, very !

It is difficult to say that, in the balf-gallop of a hoise on a road, there can bo anything peculiar, so as to lead to its identity; and yet wo all kno\u00bb how the footsteps of those with whom we are familiar are readily and easily recognised. It might be so with Daisy. But the impression was eo strong on the mind of Edith, that, without further reflection, 6ho ac cepted it a. a fact. Tbe eyes of Jonathan Wild, though, were upon her slightest movement He, too, had heard tho sounds, and whatever might be his opinion of them, he kept a cautious observation of Edith. She ttied again to open the window. Wild caught hor wrist. \"Hold!\" Bo she felt that, although Jonathan Wild h .d stated that Felix Heron was no more, the fact, if fact it were, was by no means proved. What an immeasurable distance there ia be tween those two conditions ! Let any human heart that beats responsive to tne distresses and the anxieties of E-iih H.?ron. look back upon its own career, and ask itself if it has not felt all the diffeience between those two words \u2014 dead and living ? Death may be near, and the shadow of the wings of tbe fell destroyer m\u00bby be upon the eye* we love so well; bu', still, while the breath of life lingers on the dear lips* we bave hope that nothing but actual <:eath can rob ub of. And so it was with Edith. \" No, no I Villain, unhand me! I feel that bo who approaches is \u2014 is \u2014 a friend !\" She was about to say FeUx Heron, but she dreaded to pronounce the name, as yet. \"Indeed!\" replied Wild. \" The\"a a friend oJ yours is a foe of mine.\" As Wild spoke, he rapidly unti.d hia cravat, aud began to bind it round the f_ce of Edith, covering her mouth with its fiist fold. \"Help! oh, help!\" \" Cau't you hold her hands, my lord ?\" said Wild ; \" she will scratch me directly.\" \" f cannot\" She was told that her Felix was no more, but her mind would not receive tho intelligence as an undoubted faot \" A light I\" cried Jonathan Wild,\u2014\" a light hero, quickly I\" Oue of his men held his lantern close to the coach-door. By its light Edith saw the terrible face of Wild. \" Thank you, then, for nothing I Well, if you will have tbo bracelets, you mnatl\" \"Help! Oh, Felix\u2014 help!\" \" Ah I That's the game, is it ?\" Snap went the spring of t'le handcuffs, which Wild with professional dexterity, fixed on to the wrists of poor Edith. The cravat was wound round her head and face. She could scarcely breathe, much less call out for aid. She saw, too, the pale, ghastly countenance of Lord Warringdale, as, with a groan, he sat down in the coach. Jonathan Wild then 'got into the vehicle him self, muttering, as he did so, \" It is as well that I look after my prpperty, though I don't like to be ihut up in a box on w heels. It was evideut that by his properly he momt both Edith and Lord Warringdale, for there was nothing in the shape of plunder in the coach that could be called by such a name. Warringdale closed his eyes. Edith could not take hers from tbe face of Jonathan Wild; and he, with his arms folded across his breast, looked with ill-suppreesed triumph from one to the other. Jonathan thought bis time had surely come now when he could triumph over all who had opposed him. But, although Lord Warringdale closed his eyes, and would fain bave kept them closed until reach ing London, he had an uneauy sensation that he was being looked at; and so, with a groan, for he was actually in considerable pain, he looked up. He met the basilisk glaace of Wild. \" Well, my lord, how fares it with you now ?\" \"IU\u2014 ill!\" The horseman approached. A loud voice called out to tbe man who drove it \" Halt I halt ! Whose coach is this, and whither are you going ?\" Ob, if Edith could but have screamed out one word in reply to that voice, how happy she might have been. It was the well-known accents of Felix Heron, that, sounded clearly aud lightly on tho night air. Wild was astounded. \" Perdition!\" he gasped. \"The fellow has nino lives, and one to spare !\" \"My brother!\" exclaimed Warringdale. \" Silence, idiot !\" said Wild. The coach stopped. Wild felt that all now depended upon the ready wit cf his man Rattles, who drove the coach \u2022 for notwithstanding he, Wild, was there himself' and well armed, and he had two of his men with him, he paid Felix Heron the compliment of waiting rather to let him pass than to engage in a conflic. with him. \"Ah, people should not get in the way of powder and shot, if they can help it\" Edith started. fihe heard a sound on the road that in some"], [369, "EDITH HERON. 363 * Why don't yon speak, driver ?\u25a0\" cried Heron. \"I will, sir!\" said the janissary, who drove the coach. \"It's Mr. Whiffles, sir, the apothecary ; and the sick lady may be at death's door, or right through it, before he gets there.\" \" An apotheoary ?\" \" Yes, sir, Mr. Whiffles ; and he has been called up to go to old Lady Boodle, you see. sir, who is took bad with the spasmodics 1\" \" Oh, very well ; go on !\" \u25a0 Felix !\" \" What do you mean ? What is tbe matter ? Why, Captain I the kid is your kid, and Lady Edith is a prisoner with Jonathan Wild.\" Heron nearly fell from his saddle. In a few brief words, Tom Bipon had managed to convey to him the worst intelligence that mortal lips could utter. Edith a prisoner in the hands of the villain Wild! He was stunned for a few seconds, and then slipping from Daisy, he walked up to the mile stone, and lifted the ohild in his arms, holding the little soft face towards the east, so that all the light that the sky would afford should fall upon it. Tes. Edith did manage to cry Felix ; bnt, muffled up as she was, the sound was as if it had come from miles and miles away. And yet it was sufficient faintly to reach the ears of Felix Heron. One glance was quite sufficient It was his own little one. He started so suddenly, that Daisy was alarmed, and made a bound forward, that carried her and her rider past the coach. \" Please, sir, may I go on ?\" said Battles. \"Yes, yes 1\" The coach lumbered on. \" Edith 1 Edith !\" he cried, \" what pangs must yon now be suffering!\" \" Don't take on so, Captain I\" '\u25a0 Oh, heaven!\" \" Give me the kid ; it's a going to cry again.\" \"No \u2014 no. Tom \u2014 Tom, before I go distracted tell me all \u2014 how did it happen ?\" \"I will, Captain. But first of all, tell me \u2014 did you come right along the road ?\" '\u2022Yes\u2014 yes 1\" \"Did you meet a coach ?\" \"Ah I\" A feeling of suffocation and faintness came over Edith. \" It was \u2014 it was my Edith who called me !\" cried Heron. \" There is some more danger in the forest that my utmost fears have pictured ; and upon the night air the sound of my name, uttered by her lips, must have come. Yes, Edith, I come to you !\u2014 I oome to you ! On, Daisy, on !\" Daisy took two of her terrific leaps ; and then, bending low to the ground, she seemed to fly over it rather than in an ordinary way to gall _ p. The distance that the coach, containing the unhappy Edith, had got from the two-mile stone was about a mile and three quarters; and that space was traversed by Daisy in an incredibly short space of time. The two- mile stone was close at hand. There was something odd about the mile stone. What conld it be? \" Ho, there I\" cried Heron. \" Speak, or I fire !\" \"Tom! Tom I Woa! Oh, dear, don't!\" shouted \"Did you?\" \" I did\u2014 yes, yes !\" \" Well, the Lady Edith, I rather think, was in side, and along with Jonathan Wild.\" Felix Heron almost screamed with the mental agony that this commotion gave him. \"Fool! fool! Oh, thou soddened fool!\" he cried. \" Take the dear little one. To you I con fide it To the forest, Tom \u2014 to the forest quic_ly. Another time I will hear all ysu have to tell me. This is my way ! Oh, fool! fool!\" Heron sprung upon the bock of Daisy again. and turning her head towards London, he set off at a speed that would soon have brought him up with the coach again, if he had had any one but the crafty and far-seeing Jonathan Wild to deal with. \" Well,\" said Tom, as he stood in the middle of the road with the child in his arms, \" I don't see that I have done anything to be colled fool ! fool ! for.\" Tom thought that these words, whioh were in tended by Heron as self-reproaches, were ad dressed to him. \" Fool ! fool ! Oh, fool 1\" Tom added. \" Well I did the best I could. I put some shot into that rascal, Lord Warringdale, and I took care of the kid; but if the Oaptain does think I'm a fool! fool! why, I suppose I am, and I can't pos sibly help it Don't make a row now !\" The child began to cry. \" Now, don't\u2014 don't I Shall I sing you a nice little nursery song ? There, don't kick so\u2014 don t cry 1 Come, here goes ! \" ' BiU Grabs the Pet was a smasher bold a voice . Heron drew rein, and, as Daisy stopped sud denly and elevated her fore feet high ia the air, Tom Kipon, for it was indeed himself, called out, \" Don't fire I It's only me, Captain ; and I have the baby all safe !\" u Tom Kipon ?\" \"Yes, Oaptain ; that's me. He hasn't cried much, and when he did I shook him, till he left off, and he's all right now.\" \"What on earth do you mean, Tom ?\" Felix Heron was lost in astonishment, but by the first faint gleams of morning light, that began now to irradiate the eastern sky, he saw tolerably plain that Tom Kipon was sitting on a mile-stone, nurring a chUd. That that chUd waa his own aid not enter the imagination of Felix Heron, and he looked on the spectacle before him with more curiosity than in tere st. \" I don't mean to say,\" added Tom, \" that I shook its breath away, but just a little bit of a joggle, you know ; and then it dropped off asleep, and is so now.\" _,___._ \" What have you been abont, Tom, and what child is it?\" Heigho for the spangles I' Eh?

LE JEUNE MAKES HIS LAST DYING SPEECH, BUT NOT HIS CONFESSION. The Reverend Mortification Ripon darted bo hind a tree as Ogle spoke, from which seoure re treat he listened to tbe sounds that had aroused Ogle's attention. While all these rather exciting and startling events were taking place on tbe high road between London and Epping, there were occurrences in the forest deserving of attention. Ogle was exceedingly anxious for some intelli gence of what was going on in respect to Edith and the coach ; but as minute after minute fled, and he beard nothing, he conld not make up his mind to remain longer in the wood. Seeing that all the scouts were at their posts, and that the hostage Le jeune was safe and well watched, Ogle strolled to the outskirts of the forest, and listened intently for any sound that should in dicate the return of Editb. \" Yea, I hear some one ooming \" \"What?\u2014 who?\" \" Yea, it soundeth like a donkey iu a state of alarm.\" \" Hush ! HiUoa ! hilloa ! Who comes here ? Speak, or you are in some peril !\" \"All's right!\" \"Eh? What do you say ?\" \"All's right Don't you know me? I'm Tom Ripon, and I'm coming in on the baby'_ back \u2014 no, the baby is on my book. Here you are, old chao ! ' Once, by laying his head down actually on the ground, he thought he heard the faint echo of a distant pistol shot, but he could not be sure. Soon, however, he was convinced tbat some one was coming rapidly on foot towards the wood. Ogle then felt tbat something was wrong, and became forward to meet this person, be he whom he might. \" Halt! Hold !\" shouted Ogle, as soon as he saw the dim shadowy form of the runner. \"Yea\u2014 I\u2014 I will!\" Tom was by no means so scant of breath with hia run to the forest as the Reverend Mortification had been, and he was able to tell Ogle all that he knew, which was a very good sequel to the story of Mortification. The child had fallen asleep snugly on the shoulder of Tom Ripon, but he was soon relieved of his burden by Mrs. Ogle, who shed abundance of tears at the peril of E lith, and dealt Tom two boxes on the ears for not carrying the child in his arms, \" like a Christian,\" as he ought. \" Well,\" said Tom, \" I'm not at all in luck's way to-night ! The Captain says I'm a fool, and Mrs. Ogle has made my ears feel like the beU of St Paul's ; but I suppose it's aU right ! I shall know now how to carry a baby like a Christian !\" Ogle strode onwards till he came to one of the open glades of the wood, and then he blBw the silver whistle he had about his neck, six times. The signal was heard by the whole of the band of Capt nu Heron, and it was obeyed by all, but those who were on scout duty ; who, it was understood, were not to leave their posts on any consideration, until relieved in the regular way. Those six shrill whistles had the effect of soon congregating around Ogle eleven of the band. The dark figures looked almost like spectres, as they emerged from the little, narrow, mysterious paths among the brushwood, and which were only known to the initiated into the secrets of Epping Forest. The dawn of the new day was now at hand, and over the tips of the trees, looking: to the east, there was a faint radiance, which each passing moment was evidently increasing; but still, down ou the green-sward of that glade, all was dark ness. It was the Rev. Mortification, and as he was nearly within the verge of the forest, he caught his foot in some brambles, and fell. Ogle was by his side in a moment. \" Speak, Mortification. Tell me what has hap pened ? I cannot see you well, but I know your voice too weU to mistake you.\" \"Yea!\" j \" Speak, speak !\" ** \" Yea! it\u2014 it\u2014 oh!\" Mortification was completely winded, and it was only in a spasmodic, jerking way that he .\u25a0ould utter a word. \" I \u2014 ah \u2014 it is\u2014 oh \u2014 easy to \u2014 to say speak \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 a fellow Yea !\" Ogle saw, or rather beard, what was the matter, aud he said, calmly, \" Wait, Mortification, till ysu i M-yivur your breath. Do not speak till you are tietter.\" A few minutes sufficed to enable Mortification to give Ogle something like a rational account of what had happened. * Then,\" said Ogle, \" the whole affair was a trick, was it?\" \" Yea, it was.\" \" And at the two-mile stone there was a regular ambuscade for the capture of Eiith ?\" \" Yea, there was \" Ogle spoke. \" Comrades, the Lady Edith is betrayed !\" A murmur of indignation broke from the band as th\u00aby he*rd these words. Og'e cjutinued. \" Then, Mortification, we shall have a hanging la tbe wood \" \"A what?\" \" An execution !\" \"Gracious me! what have I done? As the j- salmi-t says, ' You cannot hang a man to-day, K-id bring him into life alway \" \" The pretended message from the Captain was but a triuk, for the purpose of lulling our sus \u25a0\u25a0i\u00abious, and making us beUeve that we were only"], [371, "365 EDITH HERON. obeying bis orders. Tnere is only one thing that I cannot quite explain to myself, and that is how a few pass- words, only known to me and to the Captain, should have become known to Jonathan Wild and his gang!\" The band were silent ; they had none of them any means of conjecturing how this could have happened. \" Of course,\" added Ogle, \" some spy must have overheard the pass-words, but that is of little moment now. Edith i-. betrayed and taken pri soner; but, by good luck, we hold iu our hauds, as a hostage for her, one of the rascals who got np the plot!\" \" Yes, yes I Hang him ! hang him 1\" \" I mean to do so I\" One of the band, while this little discourse w_h going on, had clambered into a tree, and over a forked brauch that was about twenty feet from the ground, he hung a rope, the two ends of which reached nigh down to the green-sward of the forest. Rapidly descending then, this man tied a noose at one of the ends of the rope, and then he called out to Ogle. \" All ready.\" \" Good !\" said Ogle. \" Ah ! we shaU have plenty of light, I fancy.\" A pale yellowish beam of dayUght found its way down on to that spot of the darkened iorest, and lent a cadaverous look to the faces of aU pre sent. There was an evident stir of satisfaction among the band. It made Le Jeune look perfectly livid. \" He is half dead already,\" said one of the band. Le Jeune turned abruptly to the speaker, as he said, \" Let the other half, then, remain.\" \" No,\" said Ogle ; \" I will have no affront to my men, prisoner. You knew the fate tbat awaited you. As a hostage for the safety of another, you are here, and you must pay the penalty. \"One moment!\u2014 stop!\" The noose had been slipped round the neck oi Le Jenne. \" Bring the prisoner here!\" ordered Ogle. \" You aU know, comrades, that in matters of this kind the Captain is very particular ; so I think that it is better to get it all over before he comes back, so that he won't be troubled about it!\" \"Good \u2014 good, Ogle! Let ns [hang the seal, and tell the Captain of it afterwards!\" \" That is just my idea I\" The wretched Le Jeune was soon bought before his judges. By the dim morning light aU things could now be seen with a shadowy indistinctness, but still sufficiently to enable Ogle to observe that the face of the prisoner was as pale as death, and that there was a look of trouble and agonized appre hension in his eyes. Le Jeune was a fatalist, and something seemed to tell him now that bis last hour on earth had come. \" Well, what is it ? asked Ogle. \" Do you want money ?\" Ogle shook his head. \" No amount of money that you could name, or possibly place in our hands, would bave your life. We neither sell our vengeance, nor our mercy !\" \" But is this a way to send a man out of the world like a dog?\" \" Yea,\" said the Rev. Mortification, stepping up to him, \u2014 \" yea, if you would like a little spiritual consolation, lean give you my ideas of the state of boiling brimstone, in which, yea, you will soon be waUowing.\" \"Back, wretch 1 It is to you that I owe my present situation. But for your infernal sugges- tion to keep me here I should be free.\" \" Yea, that is true ; and as I bave been tbe cause of your misfortune, yea, I feel called upon to be of such service to you as I may.\" \"Service? Service?\" But he had not the courage of the fatalist, who stands in need of a better philosophy He had tbe fear as well as the conviction of approaching death before his eyes. That fear completely overcame him for the pre sent time, and he looked around him with an ex pression of anguish and despair that was appalling. \" What is aU this ?\" he said. \" Why should I die?\" \" I wiil tell you,\" repUed Ogle, \" since you think it necessary to ask It is for betraying the Lady Edith into the hands of her foes.\" \"Betraying? \u2014 betraying? What manner of men are you who speak of betraying as a crime?\" \" Yea.\" \" What service ?\" \" I have already mentioned, even unto Mr. Ogle, that I wUl, peradventnre it should be required, pnll your legs \u2014 yea, I will.\" Le Jeune uttered an oath. Ogle shook his head. Le Jeune continued, \" Is not your whole life a scene of betrayal and ctime ?\u2014 and yours, too ! \u2014 and yours ! \u2014 and yours !\" He turned from one to another as he spoke. \" But yet yon speat of taking my life for an aot which, for the sake of a few paltry pieces of gold, you would any of you commit at any time I\" The argument was a good one; but Ogle and the band did not care then to hold any disputation with Le Jeune. It was to hang him they were assembled. \"Forbear,\" said Ogle, \" and do not die with ac imprecation on your lips.\" * This is murder I\" \" Call it what you will. Up with him!\" \u25a0 \" Hold I One moment more, and hear my last words. I defy and scorn you aU I May pestilence and death \" Ogle made a sign. Another moment, and Lo Jeune was run up to the forked bough of the tree. He plunged twice with a force that was nearly sufficient to break the cord or the branch, but then as they both stood stanch, the body, for thon it was a \" body,\" straightened itself out, and slowly swung rouud in the morning air and faced Ogle. The terribly convulsed face, with blood upot the lips, was a fearful sight. Ogle turned from il with a Bhudder. \"It was but just and proper,\" he said. \" If ev_l \u00bb\u25a0 man deserved hanging, he did-\" Ogle, however, cut the matter short in a few words. \" All tbat may be true enough, and just as you say ; but I promised you that, if any harm came to the Lady Edith through you, I would see you hanged ; and whatever I may be otherwise, I am a man of my word !\" \" You dare Bot !\" \" Oh, if that is all your reUance, we are rather daring fellows here, and yon will soon alter your opinion.\""], [372, "366 EDITH HEKON- The struggle of Le Jeune had loosened the wig that he wore, and it fell to the gronnd. Several of the band, as well as Ogle, now knew him ; and the latter cried out aloud, \" Comrades all, this is the man who produced much of the misery that the Captain and the Lady Edith passed through for so long. When I look at him cow, I feel as if two rogues were got rid of, instead of one. miry ground of the lane, and he sorambled us again, and stood on the roof of the coach- Neither Edith nor Lord Warringdale conld divine what all these measures of Jonathan Wild signified, for shut up in the ooach as they were, they could not distinguish the advance of Daisy on the road from tbe sighing and moaning of the wind among the old tree tops. If Felix Heron's progress had been slower it wonld have been much more apparent Wild peered through the gloom of the vegeta tion in the lane, and he felt sure that, before another half minute would elapse, he would see Felix Heron pass. Was it an opportunity of again placing himself in the position be had imagined was attained by the death of Heron ? \" Hoy \u2014 hoy I\" cried Tom Ripon at the moment, as he reached tbe open forest glade with the child in his arms. \" Hoy ! What is aU this about ? \" Ogle raised a shout of satisfaction at sight of the little child. \"The Lady Edith? Where is she? Is she safe and free?\" \" Not that I know,\" replied Tom Ripon ; \" but the Captain is after her as fast as Daisy can gallop, and if he don't catch the coach, why it mnst either get up into the air, or go down into the earth.\" Would it be safe, or would it present any tolerable chance of success, to fire at him as he should pass the end of the lane ? Jonathan Wild was tempted. But, then, at the speed which Heron was mak ing, what a smaU chance there would be of hitting him. To miss might be fatal. Fatal to him, Jonathan Wild, for the report of the pistol-shot would of course be heard, and then Heron would be attracted to that lane. CHAPTER OXXXIX. CAPTAIN HERON FAILS TO OVERTAKE THE COACH, AND REACHES LONDON IN DESPAIR. We have remarked that Jonathan Wild, with the knowledge that Felix Heron was still in the land of the living, was not likely to take matters quite so easily or so carelessly as he had done. Tbat Heron, by some means, would soon be informed of the real state of affairs, and pursue the coach, for the purpose of rescuing Edith, he did not donbt, and therefore he determined that tbe coach shonld, for as short a time as possible, remain on the high road between Epping Forest and London. \"No, no!\" said he, as he weighed these proba bilities in his mind \u2014 \"no, no! I dare not! The time will come, but it is not now !\" Daisy still came on. Past the end of the lane, like one of those cloudy shadows cast by the sun on a fair meadow, went Felix Heron. Wild instinctively raised his pistol as he passed, bnt he did not fire. \" Let him go \u2014 let him go !\" he muttered. \" We shall yet meet again, Oaptain Heron.\" While Jonathan was thus on the roof of the coach, within passing sight of Heron, Lord War ringdale had managed to summon strength and courage, wounded as he was, to say something to Edith in the coach. As soon as the vehiole had got a sufficient dis tance from the spot on which he bad met Felix Hir u, Jonathan WUd ordered it to halt. He then jumped out, aud looked about him \" Where are we, Rattles ?\" \" Close to tho five mile-stone, Mr. Wild. \" Do you know any by-road to London ?\" \" Ob, yes, sir. There is a long lane to the left of here, that wiU bring ns in by Battersea Fields.\" Perhaps never had the absolute fear of death been so strong in the mind of Warringdale as at that time. Not from the wound that Tom Ripon had given him. \" That will do. Get into it as soon as you can. You fellow there with the horses, gallop into London as soon as you can, and put up at the old place.\" \" Yes, sir. Not from any vengeance which Edith might in voke on bis head from Felix Heron. Not from the tardy operation of justioe against suoh a malefactor as himself, but from his own associate, Jonathan Wild. To be wounded and helpless in the hands of Wild, appears i to Lord Warringdale like a death warrant, signed and sealed. Anything would be better than such a fate. Therefore was it that he seized upon tbe op portunity, which, for all he knew, might be a very brief one, of speaking to Edith while they were alone. Wild got on to the coach-box now, and as the coach was driven into a narrow, shady lane, off the high road, he began to reload and carefully prime his pis ols. \" Stop I\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Listen !\" Rattles listened. Like the rush of a coming gale of wind, or the dashing onward progress of some torrent of water, came a sound on the highway- It was the gaUop of Daisy, which was so fleet that her footsteps scarcely seemed to touch the ground. \" Ah !\" muttered WUd ; \" he comes. If I could only have called that horse my own, I shonld have felt myself the most fortunate man in the world.\" \"Elith! Edith! I feel that I have wronged you !\" Edith replied, \" That is a feeling that contains so much truth, that I am only surprised it never occurred to you before.\" \" Yes, yes ; you do well to taunt me\u2014 I deserve it all. The worst that you can say \" \" I despise and I loathe you too much to say anything but in reply to your own words.\" \" Despise?\" \" Yes ; what can I do otherwise than despise one who has made himself the relentless foe of him wbo has ever been as generous and forbear- Wild slipped off the coach-box ; but then be thought that he should get a better sight of Felix Herou from the top of the vehicle than on the"], [373, "EDITH HERON. 367 faig as you have been wicked and unscrupulous?\" Lord Warringdale groaned. \" And do you think, Edith \" \" Hold I I will not be oalled Edith, by such men as you and Jonathan WUd. I am the Countess of Whitcombe ; and if you would hope for another word from me in reply to anything you may say, you will address me as suoh.\" \" Well, well, Countess \u2014 my lady \u2014 I have a few words to say.\" \"I listen!\" ingly imprudent for him at that time to take !__.:__ to his house in Newgate Street. True, he had originally intended to do _so ; but now that he was aware that Captain Heron had passed the coach towards London, he thought thai the probable destination of the Captain would be Newgate Street. After some reflection, Wild bethought him that there was a mansion at Whitehall which was the property of the then exiled Lord Staines, and had been shut up for a considerable time. It was a huge, crumbling old place, with a water-gate to the river ; and it had the reputation cf being haunted, since the boatmen of the Thames had declared that they had seen from the river, in the dead, still hours of the night, lights flash from the windows. \" If I repent, now, of all the evU I have done, \u2014 if I am truly, and sincerely penitent, wiU Felix Heron \" \" Who ?\" \" Felix Heron !\" \" If yon mean my husband, the Earl of Whit combe, you wiU plea\u00bbe call him by that title, or I will not answer you.\" Lord Warringdale uttered a howl of rage, which he pretended to turn off into a groan of pain, but he felt he had no resource but to comply. \" Be it so,\" he added. '* As I repent, and wish to do all I can for the benefit of my brother, why of course I can have no objection to what you wish.\" Jonathan Wild had heard as much ; and he bad had no difficulty in believing that the sup posed supernatural lights were nothing more than the reflection right through the house of passing carriage lamps in Whitehall- As he now reflected npon what he had better do with Edith, and with Lord Warringdale, this old mansion occurred to him as a mnch safer and better place than his own house. Edith merely inclined her head. \" Then, do you think his lordship will, on account of my repentance \" \u2014 here Lord Warring -!\\,io lowered his voice \u2014 \"do you think he will re-:cue me from Jonathan Wild ?\" The round-about way that the coach had been driven into London, in order to avoid Captain Heron, had happened to favour this plan of ope rations ; for it made the route pass Bankside, where if he, Jonathan, wished it, he could easily find a way to Staines House. Like most men who are snccessf ul in what they undertake, Jonathan WUd was a man of raiped resolutions, aud he had the iaculty of seeing quickly all the points for and against any propo sition. \" I do not comprehend how you can wish to be be rescued from your own associate and coad j utor in iniquity ?\" \"Hush! oh, hush!\" Jonathan WUd was heard on the roof of the coach, uttering expressions of the most fearful character. \"Yes, that wUl do,\" he muttered to himself. Staines House is tbe very place of aU others This coach can fall into tbe hands of anybody that takes a fancy to it. The horses are good ones, and are mine as lawful plunder. Halt!\" The bull-dog who drove the coach pulled up \" Battles, you will take these two horses to some stables hereabouts, and lodge them there in my name.\" \" Do not speak loud enough for him to hear,\" said Lord Warringdale. E iith was silent, and after the pause of a few Dtconds, Lord Warringdale continued. \" If you should esc*pe, Lady Edith, I pray you to tell your husband thai I am truly and sincerely repentant, and try of him to come to my rescue ; for it he dees not, I am quite confident I shall never leave tbe house of Jonathan WUd alive.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Be quick !\" The j .missaries of Wild never questioned his orders. If he had said, \" Yon wiU now drive straight into the Thames,\" the probabUity is thai they would have done so. Tbe horses then were taken out of the coach, and Rittles went off with them. \" No,\" said Edith. 1^ \"No! you wUlnot?\" \" I cannot in truth tell my husband that you are truly and sincerely repentant, because I do not know that yon are. AU that I can say is that you _aid you were.\" \" And that's an untruth !\" cried Jonathan Wild, as at the moment his face appeared at the window of the coach. Jonathan had leant over the roof to look into the vehicle, so that he presented a strange and ter rific aspect, his head and face being upside down. Lord Warringdale shrunk back into his corner of the coach, with a groan. Edith spoke not a word. \" Ha, ha !\" laughed WUd, in his own peculiarly hideous way \u2014 \" ha, ha ! Do you think I am blind, deaf, and a fool, my Lord Warringdale? No! I can see and hear, and I advise you to be a little more discreet and content.\" Wild mounted himself up on to the roof of the coach again. Jonathan himself kept guard upon his prisoner along with the other man. Tbe spot was rather a dark and lonely one, close to the Houses of Parliament, where the coach had stopped ; but, for a wonder, it attracted the notice of a watchman, who had bis box against the railings of the old Abbey, close to Poets' Corner. With his lantern swinging in his left hand and his bludgeon grasped in the other, the watchman crossed over to the coach. Wild saw him. There was not the least look of alarm or vexa tion about Wild as the watchman crossed over the way. \" Come, I say, what's all this about ? I shall have to knock you down, I suppose, and then take you up!\" \" You don't say so ?\" replied Wild, as be placed his face so that a ray if the. lantern fell full upon it After this unsuccessful attempt to impose upon Ihe sympathies of Edith, Lord Warringdale said not a word, and the coach in the cour.-e of tbe next half-hour was rumbling into the City. But Jonathan Wild was reflecting, and tbe re sult of his reflections was that it would be strik-"], [374, "EDITH HERO. 368 By tbe side of Edith he led the way to the steps by the side of Westminster Bridge. It was Wild's intention to take a wherry there to the water-gate of Staines House. When we say \" take,\" he meant not to hire one, but literally to take one without the ceremony of asking the owner's leave. But so many takings of that sort bad taken place of late at that landing-place, that tbe wat-r men had one of their body by turn an duty ail night. The watchman started back. \" Ah,\" slid Wild, \" you know me?\" \" Mr. Wild ?\" \" Just so. Be off I\" WUd gave the lantern a kick that sent it into splinters, and the watchman ran over the road, and got into his box, and t.hut himself in com pletely, so that he saw nothing. \"The idiot!\" muttered Wild. \"I wonld go over now and cut bis throat if I thought he bad seen into the coach 1\" As soon, then, as Wild laid his hands on a wherry, the man who was on the watch stepped forward. Battles now came back \"All right, Mr. WUd!\" \" Very well. Open the coach door !\" \"Yes, sir!\" \" Now, if yon please, my lady, will you be so good as to get ont, or shall I lift you?\" Edith wonld do anything to save herself from the contagion of the touch of Jonathan Wild, and she alighted from the coach. \" My Lord Warringdale,\" added Wild, \" you will be so kind as to get out !\" \"Rattles!\" \"Now, master, mayhap you will just say what yen are afier with the craft ?\" \" Certainly ! I want a boat to Paul's Stairs ?\" \" How much ?\" \"A guinea ! Here it is !\" \" That's your sort, sir ! You are a customer we like to see ; and I'll just give you a cast _h\\ - self.

It is for your own safety's sake. By this time Felix Heron is well aware tbat you bave had a band in the abduction of Edith ; and if you don't keep close while his rage lasts, be wUl kUl you if you were ten times his brother. It is to take care of your precious life that I in sist npon your coming with me.\" Lord Warringdale made no reply; be felt how useless it was to argue with such a man as Wild. But it was by no means the intention of Jona than Wild to go an inch out of his way ; aud uo sooner had the wherry fairly shot out inio the mid-stream than be eaid to tbe waterman, \" Can you swim, my friend ?\" \" Swim, sir ? I rather think I can ! Ha ! ha ! Of course I can !\" \" Then swim baok to the stairs at Westminster ; and I advise you not to look over your shoul ders !\" For a few brief seconds a hope rose up in tbe heart of Edith, that when she was out of the coach she might seek and find safety in flight As he spoke, Wild, with a sudden effort, top pled the waterman into tbe river. \" In a boat !\" yelled the man. \" I don't mean I oan swim in the water ! In a boat I Help ! \u2014 murder !\" A very few hundred yards would take her into a populous enough part of the towu, and some one might feel incUued to question the right of WUd to detain her. But this was only the dream of the moment, and it seemed as if Jonathan guessed what was passing in his mind, for he grasped her wrist, as he said, \" In life or in death you are my prisoner. Be prudent, and you Uve, and wUl once again look into tbe eyes of your husband and child ; but any attempt to foil me is full of danger.\" With a sigh of present hopelessness, Edith felt that Jonathan Wild spoke tbe truth, aud she abandoned the projtct of flight \"Now hold up bis lord .hip, \"said Wild to his men, \" and follow me. Edith, you will please to march! Stop one moment \u2014 Rattles throw a match into the coach. \"Ah I\" said Wild; \"you drown for a joke, then, do you ? It's yonr own fault !\" \" Oh, save him I\" eaid Editb. \" What for ?\" With a scream, tte can floated wide of the boat, aud was then lozi in the broad, heaving waste of the river. WUd seized the oars, and pulled the boat vi gorously lo sards the stone steps of Staines House. The keel of the boat grated upon the lower step of tbe garden gate of the old deserted man sion ; and Jonathan Wild sprung from the wherry to the moss-grown landing. Tbe other persons in the boat followed him ; and then Wild, with a vigorous push, sent the boat right out into the stream, where it was soon caught by the eddies of the river, and, sometimes broadside, and sometimes sternwise, and some times as if properly guided by man's skiU, it went up with the flowing tide. \" Yes, Mr. Wild,\" \" Ha ! ha ! It wUl be but a bad prize to any one who finds it.\" The bull-dog cast a lighted phosphorus match among the damp straw tbat lay rather thickly at the bottom of the old coach, and it began to smoulder and to light up in little thin blue flames. \" Forward 1\" said Wild."], [375, "EDITH IIEr.OX. 369 The waUs of the house reeked with moisture, and as the little party, preceded by Jonathan, walked up to the haU door, their feet sunk into the ground with a feeling as though they trod upon soddened sponge. \"Open this door for me,\" said WUd. The man Rattles produced a bunch of skeleton keys, and after a trial of one he selected another, which opened the lock. A cold, damp, noisome atmosphere issued from the house. It was as U some vault, long since abandoned to the dead, had been revealed to the Ught of day. Then WUd made a movement as though he would lead Edith into the house, but she avoided it by herself voluntarily crossing the threshold. \" That wiU do,\" said WUd. \" A Ught here I\" One of the buU-dogs produced his lantern and uncovered the shde.

The aspect of the mansion to which it suited the vUlanous designs of Jonathan WUd to consign the fair and peerless Edith was weU calculated to produce the most gloomy and despairing thoughts. Long disuse and neglect had produced that look of desolation which houses quickly enough put on when no longer the abodes of the Uving ; but in this case the time of desertion had been long enough to produce positive dilapidation. Moss had grown upon the steps. The garden that reached down to the river was overgrown with strange vegetation.

Edith felt that any resistance at tbat time might bring npon ber fresh terrors, but conld have no effect in the alleviation of her condition, and she followed in sUence. you suffer is self-iutlictel I hivs til you I would take your word not to attempt an escape, and you decline giving it I am compelled, there- fore, to be upon my guard.\" As he spoke her caught her by the wrist, and forcing her arm down to one of the cross spills of a heavy, old fashioned arm-chair, he manacled the wrist of that arm to tho sp II, wi.h a puir of hand- cuffs that he took from his pocket Poor Edith was a complete prisoner. She felt very helpless. But, although Wild might do this much in the way of manuoling the hand of Edith, he had no power over bor fiee, undaunted spirit, and she disdained even to complain. StiU he spoke with moderation. \" It will now depend upon your hnsband, Felix Heron, whether you be for a long or a short time my prisoner. To-morrow you shall have food, or rather, I should say, to-day, for the night has pasted away.\" As he spoke he lifted the lantern, which bis men had left him, from tbe floor, and with it in his hand, walked to the door of the room. Theu he turned, and sent the full, wide ray of the lantern upon Edith. \" Speak,\" he said ; \" shall I release yon on your word of honour not to escape ?\" \" No 1\" On the first floor there was a suite of rooms of noble proportions, and it was into one of tho.e that Wild made bis way with his prisoner. Holding the lantern high above his head, Wild looked about him, and by the faint light which it presented, Edith too observed the saloon \u2014 for it was quite large enough to deserve that name\u2014 in which she was. At first sight the place seemed to be a mass of spiders' webs and dust A closer inspection, though, showed that these were but exterior indications of the oontents of this room, in whioh all the massive old substantial furniture that had no doubt once contributed so much to the magnificence and oomfort of the house remained. \" Be it so, then 1 Good day !\" Wild passed ont at tbe doorway, but he was troubled at heart as he did so, for from the moment tbat Edith had been his prisoner, he had begun to doubt the success of suoh a plan for bringing Captain Heron to terms. Jonathan then took his way to his ewn house in the City, where he found that Lord Warring dale had been safely conducted by his men. In one of those attics of Little Newgate, scarcely less gloomy for their situation than the cells be neath tbe house, Warringdale had been placed, and be had fallen into au uneasy slumber by the lime WUd arrived. \" This will do,* muttered WUd. Edith shuddered. Jonathan turned to her then, and, in a voice of affected civility, ipoke. \" Edith, or L\u00bbdy Editfc, if you Uke that n\u00bbn_e better, I owe you no favour, but you shall receive some at my hands.\" \" I ask none,\" replied Edith. \" Bnt be assured tbat a fearful account wiU be exacted oi you for your work of this night\" \" I will take my chance of that Ak 1 what is It, now, buU-dogs ?\" \" If you please, Mr. WUd, my Lord Wsrring dale says he is worse, and oan as well die here, if you will not take him to his own chambers.\" Lord Warringdale bad been left in the ball of Staines House; and Jonathan Wild now, after a few moments' reflection, gave his order to the two (iui\u00bbs*rie* \" Get a sedan-chair, and take him to Little Newgate, and place him in one of the spare cells, ind keep him safe for me.\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" While the miserable Warringdale was carried, or half-carried, round the garden of the mansion to a Uttle door that opened into Whitehall Yard, lonathan again spoke to Edith. \" I wish you no ill, and seek to inflict no harm ; but it i\u00a3 necessary, as well for my safety as for my Interests, that you should remain a prisoner for a lime. I do not wish you to sufft-r any thing; and If you will promise not to attempt to escape, you shall have as mnch freedom as the whole house can afford you.\" It is necessary now, however, that we shonld pay some attention to the proceedings of Captain Heron. When Heron reached London alone with Daisy, he did just what Jonathan Wild supposed he would do \u2014 that is to say, he made his w_y as di rectly to the honse in Newgate Street as he conld. But still Heron found himseU awkwardly situated to know how to act, since he was so completely alone, and he felt how much better it would have been if he had taken with him one of his band. What to do with Daisy was a difficulty he found almost insurmountable, tiU an idea struck him, which he proceeded at once to carry out In St Paul's Churchyard he fc__.ew ihat there was a bouse to let which h -d been lor a long time in that condition, and he remembered tbat Ogle had told him the old woman who was taking oaie of it was an aunt of Mrs. Ogle's. Upon these circumstances Heron built a hope that he shoul 1 there find a temporary refuge for Daisy. \" No ; I wUl not promise 1\" \" Be it so. I did not expect you would; but it was only fair to give you the chance. You wiU be a prisoner in this room.\" Edith made no reply. Jonathan Wild went from wisdow to window and felt the fastenings, but he was by no means contented with them. After the pause of some few seconds, he muttered to himself, \" Yes, at all events, for the present, it must be so.\" Then approaching Edith he added, \" Whatever The early hour of the morning was just that at whioh London was most deserted of street way farers, so that Heron strolled into 6t Paul's Churchyard, finding himself the only person then vinible.

The old woman, thoroughly alarmed, woulJ have sprung a rattle, but Heron prevented ber, and in a few words told her who he was, and that he wanted her to give Daisy a temporary lodging, and she should have a couple of guineas for her trouble. \" No v,\" he laid to the other janissary, \" you will put this fellow somewhere ir safe'y, or I must put a bullet into his head where the brains ought to b\u00bb !\" The juiiesary was thoroughly subdued, and he helped Heron to tilt the miserable Arnold down t he stairs leading to the cells, in which process he, \\ruoid, got so many extra bumps on the head that he lay like a dead man on the earthen floor be low. \" Now,\" said Heron, \" you wUl show me the way to the attic where my Lord Warringdale is lying.\" \" Yes, Captain ! This way ; but, after this, if you don't take me with you to Epping Forest, I am in for a hanging, with Jonathan Wild's help, next sessions !\" This made all smooth, and without havibg been delayed more than a quarter of an hour in all, Heron wa. once more in Newgate Street \"\u00ab Just as he leached it he saw a man come out of Wild's bouse and go hastily in the direction of the City. At the corner of one of tbe thoroughfares lead ing to Newgate Market, Heron caught this man by tbe back of tbe neok, and brought him to a stand-still. \" If you can be faithful to me, I will do eo : but I don't know how I am yet to trust you. If you like to come to the forest, and take your chance of what reception you get, you may, perhaps, be oome one of us.\" \" I will, Captain ; and here is the room where my lord lies.\" The janissary opened the door with his pass key; for, as Jonathan Wild had not yet oome bome, he had not had the opportunity of locking the seoond lock on the attio door, which would have prevented any one visiting the prisoner without him \" Ob !\" cried the buU-dog, \u25a0 that won't do for me, my fine fellow!\" \" Then will this ?\" said Heron. As he spoke, he dashed the feUow up against a door, and knocked his head so repeatedly and violently against it that the janissary thought him self in the hands of some terrible engine of un known force. Warringdale was lying on a miserable truckle b.d, and tbe attic was lighted by a rushlight He groaned as Heron appeared, and, in a moan ing voice, spoke. \" Let me go home, WUd \u2014 let me go home ! I shall die in this place !\" Heron sho >k him by the arm. \"Awake, and answer me I Where is Edith?\" \" At these words, in the voice of Heron, which Warringdale knew so well, his guilty soul took tbe alarm, and he started up to a sitting posture in the bed. \" Mercy !

Lord Warringdale imitated fainting so weU flat Felix Heron was deceived by it, and he turned to the janissary as he said, \" There is blood, I see, upon him ; aud he is badly hurt If you really now wish to belong to me, you wUl this night, or rather by tbe coming light of this early morning, try to earn my g.ood opinion.\" \" I wiU, Captain.

The man who had followed him from Jonathan Wild's house was olose to his side. He looked inquiringly into the face of his new master. \" l'es, Captain, I can; I shall be at Poets' Corner, by the old Abbey, soon after you.\" \" Do so I do eo !\" Heron went throngh the streets at a sharp trot- It was still early dawn only ; and as he approached tbe Abbey he saw a crowd of watchmen, and tbe scent of fire was in the air. What could this mean ? What was it to him, Felix Heron, and why was it that a sense of uneasiness grew up in his mind, on account of that odour of fire that was in the air? , \" Follow me !\" said Heron ; and he then rode from the spot where he felt that he had for the present not the least tidings of Edith. If ever any one in this world was more likely than another to adopt a bold and perilous polioy in an emergency, that one was FeUx Heron. A price was on his head. Probably the hands of all men were uplifted against him, and by daylight the streets of Lon- don wonld be for him full of danger. But he did not shrink from all that peril now that the object was the rescue of his Edith. Taking the nearest route, he made his way to Castleneau House as openly as though a thousand pounds were not to be earned by any one who might be able to cry out, \" There goes Oaptain Heron, the great highwayman of Epping Forest!\" It was no donbt this very boldness that brought with it the element of safety. Had he gone sneaking down bye-ways, and put on the look of a man that wished to avoid obser vation, he would have inevitably excited suspi cion. All he could see was a burning coach when he reached the spot; but he heard voices, and one of them cried out aloud, \" Whoever was in the old coach is burnt to death, for here are the charred bones.\" CHAPTER CXLI. JONATHAN WILD ATT.MPTS A BOLD PLAN TO FORCE FELIX HERON TO TERMS. It was only for a few seconds that the horrible, maddening idea found a home in the mind of Felix Heron that his Edith had, as a prisoner of Jonathan Wild, met death in so fearful a shape. On the instant, almost, that the suggestion crossed his imagination he disiegarded it. \" No, no 1 that cannot be,\" he said, \" whUe there is justice and mercy in heaven!\" He rode np to the spot A man was looking on, with quiet unconcern in his aspect, and to him Heron appealed. \" What has happened here?\" \" Oh. only one of Jonathan WUd's freaks \u2014 that isaU!\" \" Did you see him ?\" \" Yes. I was hereabouts, and I saw him fast enough. He took two prisoners with him on to the river\u2014 one was badly hurt, I fanoy, by his groans, and the other was a lady.\" \" Are yon sure of what you say ?\" \" Faith, no ; for in this world it is said that a man ought to be sure of nothing but death and quarter day, and least of all ought he to be sure of what he thinks he sees and hears.\" Felix Heron fonnd that this man was one of those railing, shabby philosophers who are gene rally to be found moializing after such a fashion when, by their own folUes, they have fallen out with fortune. He stood not another moment with him, but, hurrying to the stairs at Westminster, he eagerly inquired among the watermen if such a party as would comprise Wild and his prisoners had taken a boat. As it was, he reached Castleneau House in per fect safety, and no one had bestowed on him more than a passing observation. At the gate he dismissed Jonathan Wild's man, saying to him, \"Go to Epping Forest, and ask for Ogle, and tell him what has taken place. He wiU no donbt detain you under durance tiU I return, but that will not hurt yon.\" \" All right, Captain !\" \" Go, then, at oncel\" In a few moments Heron was in the court-yard of Castleneau House, muoh to the alarm of old Anthony, who regarded him with inquiring eyes. \" Yes,\" said Heron, for he read the old man's thoughts ; \" Elith is in danger, and I must see Lady Castleneau as soon as she is up !\" \" That wiU be at once, then 1\" replied Anthony ; \" for Martha shall ronse her on suoh news !\" Tears were in the old man's eyes as he hastily left Heron; and within the space of twenty minutes from that time Lady Castleneau was in her breakfast-room. Felix Heron rapidly put her in possession ef all that he had to tell her ; and Lady Castleneau, although she looked pale and shook a little, did not lose that self-command and high moral courage which characterized her. She rung the bell at once. \" Anthony, the carriage !\" \" Yes, my lady !\" \" My dear Felix, we will go to Lord Bridge water at once. He wUl tell us what to do.\" All he could ascertain was that one wherry was missing. Tbat was enough. The cine was not perfect, but it was sufficiently apparent to let Heron know that WUd had con veyed Edith somewhere by the route of the river. Where had be gone ? That was the question. As Felix Heron glanced along the shores of the Thames, his eyes feU upon the gloomy old land ing-place of Staines Honse; and little did he suspect that there was his Edith, almost within caU cf him, had he raised his voice somewhat beyond its usnal key.

But Heron was not lo unmindful of Lady Castleneau as to permit her to leave her house breakfastless. He insisted npon waiting nntil she had made that meal, and then they both set forth together in the old coach, which, although lament-"], [379, "EDITH HURON. 373 'I ably past the fashion of the day, was stUl respeot able and comfortable.

My writ shall issue within an hour, to have her brought here to this house.\" \" I do not know how to thank you, my lord,\" said H\u00abron. \" No, no I Yon come to do me a favour, Whit combe, and to please me if you come to say that I can serve yon in any way.\" Heron then informed him of what had hap pened, and the young Earl at once suggested the remedy. \" I will go with you to the house of the Lord Chief Justice,\" he said, \" and he will, in his offi cial capacity, wrest from the hands of Jonathan Wild the Lady Edith \" \" Yes,\" said Lady CasUenean, \" that wUl be the way. My coach is at the door.\" \" Slop,\" added Heroa, \" one moment. Is it weU to embarrass the Lord Chief Justice by my presence?\" \"Fear nothings replied the Earl of Bridge water. \" He may suspect who you are, but he will not know for a certainty, and so he wUl not seek to know.\" The Lord Chief Justice rang a hand-bell, and a clerk appeared. \" Mr. Broom, you will\u2014 \" \" My lord, my lord \" Tbe clerk pointed at Heron. \" Wnat now?\" \" This is the notorious highway\u2014\" \" SUence, sir. Whoever you find with me and beneath my roof, is to you none other than your master's guest Beware, sir. You have neither eyes nor ears here but such as I aUow you.\" \" I beg pardon, my lord.\" \" Draw up a writ of personal service on Jona than WUd to brio i? here immediately the Lady Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, and see that it is served by a couple of men who may be depended upon.\" \" Yes, my lord.\" The clerk backed out of the room. \" Be it so,\" said Heron. \" I shonld not have said one word on that p_int, only that if Edith be rescued from Jonathan Wild I should not like her to be in a position to suffer on my account the pangs that 1 now suffer on hers.\" There was so much pathos in the words of FeUx Heron, and in the tone in which he uttered them, that Lady Cas lenean mntely expressed her sympathy with him by clasping his hands in hers. \" Is he safe ?\" asked Lord Bridgewater. \" His situation is worth some six hundred year,\" remarked the Lord Chief Justice, quietly, and looking np at tbe ceiling as he spoke. \" There is one thing, my lord,\" said Heron, \" whioh I long to explain.\" \" What is it ?\" But she did not speak. Perhaps at that moment the bold, fearless heart of the old gentlewoman was too full for words. \" Simply that if I knew where the viUain, WUd, had concealed my wife, I shonld not have troubled you with this application.\" \" It is no trouble. Will you excuse me, m.dam, whUe I open these letters, some of which may call for immediate attention?\" \" Of course I will, Joe,\" said Lady Castleneau. The Lord Chief Justice started. It was a strange thing to see Felix Heron, the celebrated highwayman, on whose head the law would willingly have heaped all its terrors, cross ing the threshold of the highest legal authority, next to the Chancellor, in the kingdom. The name of the Earl of Bridgewater was suffi cient to procure access at once to the Lord Chief Justice, who was at breakfast. He was a cold, austere man, bnt his sense of right and wrong was acute, and he was not likely to travel out of his way to do any injury to Heron. Lord Bridgewater and tbe expectant Felix Heron thought that Lady Castleneau had sud denly taken leave of her senses, to call the Lord Chief Justice Joe. But Lady Castleneau only smiled, as she added, \" Do yoH remember Paul's School, and yonr mother, and her fiiend, witn the long curls, who used to take you to Kew ?\" The Lord Chief Justice held out both his hands. As they ascended tbe first staircase of the man sion, Heron bad made up his mind to trust the Lord Chief Justice with the secret of who he was rather than leave him to his own conjectures on the subject But this motive Heron kept to himself ; and it was with some surprise that the young Earl of Bridgewater saw Heron wa k up to the table at which the Lerd Chief Justice sat, and heard him say, \" My lord, I feel confii-nt I shall have your assistance, and 1 feel as confident that, yonr lor.t ship wiU not betray a confidence, which is neces sary, I thibk, because, asking yonr assistance, it is unfair to be otherwise than candid. I am tbst Felix Heron who claims to be the rightful Earl of Whitcombe.\" The Lord Cbief Justice did not express the least surprise, bnt he said, gently, \" Be seated, madam\u2014 be seated, my Lord Bridgewater\u2014 be seated sir. What is the nature of the application \" Are you that dear friend of my poor mother, whom I was so attaohed to?\" \" I am I\" \"Alas! alas! How time blurs the memory, and makes the sunny spots of our youth fade away. Yes, now I know you well ! Is this Lady Edith, you all speak of, any relation of yours?\" \" She is my dear niece, and was the only chUd that should be oalled such, iu affection and good nfss, of tbe late Judge Taileton I\" \" Ah, yes \u2014 ..e .'

A wretched or.ature of the name of Jane Flem ing had actually been executed at Tyburn recently for real or supposed oomplicity, for those were days in which death at the gallows was considered the shortest way, and tha best, of weeding the cri minal population. Thi*, then, was Jonathan's errand to Sir John Fielding. Sir John was then a magistrate at Bow Street, and probably no person liviog had such a di-like to Jonathan Wild as the famous novelist who then eat upon the semi-judicial bench. But he had to administer the law, and WUd knew that he would do bo if called upon in a regu lar way. At first Wild wanted a private interview with Sir John Fielding, but the latter remarked that he liked the air of his private room to be kept as pure as possible, and therefore declined it Upon this, in the midst of the laughter which the magistrate's reply caused in court, WUd was compelled to state his charge: \" I then, yonr worship,\" he said, \" apply for aregn lar warrant to apprehend a woman who is the com panion and accomplice of a highwayman. Her name is Edith Heron, and probaby by her means the man may be brought to justice, if it be found that that is the only way by which she can release herself, and in these cases, as your worship knows, the proseoution is never pressed against the woman if the man can be taken.\" \" You make oath of the fact ?\" \" Yes, your worship.\" \" Take tho warrant, then ; but hark yon, Mr. Wild, I will have no imprisonment in yout Little Newgate, by warrants from me. Remember I am to see the prisoner to-morro w morning, or to know that the capture is not made \" \" Certainly, your worship.\" WUd left the court, and handed the warrant to one of his men, who at a signal from him, had got up behind the coach when it left Newgate Street. It was one of the men who had been with him to Staines Hou-e. A hackney coach conveyed them perhaps a trifle quicker than they could have walked, and they soon stood on Wild's threshold, and knocked at the door with the air of men in authority. \u00ab Now for it!\" said Quilt Arnold, as he flung the door op\u00bbn. \u00ab Mr. Wild I\" \" Not up\" \u201e ,, , , \" That don't matter to us,\" said the clerk. \"We must see him. A message frornthe Lord Chief Justice ! Where can I find him ?\" Arnold grinned from ear to ear. \" If yon don't mind taking your chance,' he said, \" you wiU find him in the back room, in the first' floor.\" \"All's right.\" \u00ab Is it all right ?\" said Quilt Arnold, as he looked after the retreating form cf the olerk\u2014 \" is it all right ?

The clerk tried tbe door of the room to which he had been directed, and then rapped sharply at it, for it was locked. _.... ~ \u2022\u2022_, \" Hoy ! hoy ! Hilloa 1 Mr. Wild ! Hoy !\" Bang came something on the inside panel of the door, with such force, that the panel spUt, aud then Jonathan Wild called out. \" Who is there ? Come in and be shot, will you? Confound you\u2014 or stop! That will do, perhaps\" Bang ! went a pistol. The bullet flew past the cheek of the clerk, who immediately retreated down stairs, about four at a time. \" That's it,\" said Quilt Arnold. \" Didn't I tell yon, now, my fine fellow, eh?\" \" What is it?\" roared WUd, now, from the top of the stairs. \" There, you bad better tell him.\" \" A wan ant from the Lord Chief Justice, Mr Wild.\" \" What about ?\" \" To produce before him one Elith, Countess o Whitcombe, forthwith 1\" \"Oh! that's it, is it?\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild. You had better think twice before you do anything hastily !\" \" No, I won't think twice. I have made up my mind at once. She is not in my custody.\" Quilt Arnold grinned. \u00bb Then you had better,\" added the clerk, \" wait upon his lordship, and say so.\" \" I mean it Here I am, all ready. Now, my fine fellows, I am at your set vice: whatever we do, let ns always respect the authorities, eh? Oh, yon have a coach, tben, have you \u2014 that will do. I wiU go with you, and on the way I can call and transact tbat little business I have with Sir John Fielding, the magistrate.\" WUd had a chuckUng air of satisfaction on his face, as he spoke, and it was quite dear to the Justice's clerk, and to the officers, that he had some scheme in his mind that would probably de feat the object of the warrant they had brought That scheme was a bold one. Jonathan Will felt that it would be as muoh as his place was worth to re'.a-n Edith in the face of a demand f .nr her fronsn.h an authoiityas the Eord Chi.;\" Jabtl-B-; and Le was pnazled likewise to di.co.ii bo v it was that S\" quickly as ei the abduction o' Eii'.h, tbat demand had arhstn ; bj be mad;: up his mini toaotcree that might answer \u25a0 il L\u00bb pstpcmf, mJ. bf \u00bb mi* \u00abMie tor __.___-U at \" Execute this,\" he said ; \" you know where to sind the prisoner.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Take her to the Compter, and say tha. she is to be weU watched.\" \" All right, sir.\" \" Now, if you please,\" said Wild, \"we will go to the Lord Chief Justice, for roy little affair with Sir John Fielding is arranged.\" The coach started again, and soon pansed at the house of the Lord Chief Justice, where waited, with no small anxiety, Lady Castleneau, the Earl of Bridgewater, and Felix Heron. CHAPTER OXLIL JONATHAN WILD BREAKS A WINDOW, AND THB LORD CHIEF JOSTICE IS DEAF AND BLIND. It was a very anxiou t hour and a half that Felix H ron spent in tnat room, at the house of the Lord Chief Justice. The Judge opened all his letters, and made memoranda upon them, and still Jonathan Wild did not come. ihe salt- u_tt--."], [381, "KDITH HERON. 375 At length the sound of coaoh wheels at the door announced an arriva[. The Lord O'.ief Justice looked up. \"That large soreen yonder,\" he said, \"makes, in effect, two rooms of this one.\" The hint was too p Jpable to be mistaken. \" A thousam thanks!\" said Felix Heron; and he s'epped at once behind the screen. Another moment, and the door of the apartment was opened. \" Mr. Wild!\" announced a servant Jonathan, nih a low bow and a look of hu mility, entered the room ; but, at one glance, he saw to whose interference be was indebted for the warrant from the high legal authority. The presence of Lady Castleneau and the young Earl of Bridgewater explained all. At least Wild thought their presence did so ; for he bad not the least idea that Felix Heron was in such a presence, c insicering the position in which he stood in regard to the law. The Lord Chief Justice looked up coldly. Wild bowed again. \" I am here, my lord, to make answer to your summons.\" water. \" I want to know when the well-known just and considerate Sir John Fielding granted such a warrant ?\" \" Ask him, then !\" said WUd. \" Insolent villain !\" \" Nay, my lord if it be insolent to apprehend a highwayman's trull, why, we officers of the poUce area bad set indeed!\" As Jonathan Wild spoke, Lady Castleneau clapped her hands together, as though quite de lighted at what he said. This very much surprised Jonathan; and he was still more astonished at the Earl of Bridge water, who nodderl, and said, \" Good ! capital!\" But it was at the conduct of the Lord Chief Justice tbat WUd was still more surprised than at that of either the Earl of Bridgewater or Lady Castleneau. Suddenly, his lordship got np, and began to study attentively a picture which hung over tha chimney-piece, as if be had never seen it before. Now, all these actions, which were simcl taneous, arose from one simple fact. Felix Heron had stepped out from behind she screen. \"Well, sir?\" So noiselessly did he do so, that as Wild's back was towards him, he never beard him ; and untfl Heron laid hold of him by the collar with one hand, and the waist by the other, Jonathan was in happy ignorance that any one else was present Wild uttered a shout \" The person named is not in my custody, my lord.\" \"Beware, sir; at your peril utter a false hood in ilis matter, or tamper with my warrant\" \" Not for the world, my lord.\" The Lord Chief Justice was silent for a few seconds, and then he said, \" Was suoh a person in your custody ?\" \" Ye\u00bb, my lord.\" \"Well?\" By an exertion of his great strength, Captain Heron fairly lifted him off the floor, and flung him with a crash right through a window which was opposite to him. The noise, with the exception of the yell of rage and fear that was uttered by Jonathan Wild, was not great in consequence of the force with whioh Felix Heron flung him Nor was tbe destruction of the window so com plete as any one would have imagined it must be after such an occurrence. \" So far in my custody, my lord, as any criminal may be whom I, a constable, have authority toap preheud, and charge with an offence.\" \" Explain f urthtr, sir.\" \" Cheerfully, my lord. I am only anxious to do my duty to those in authority over me, and to the public, so I appreheud evil doers npon information and warrants, and this is one.\" As a bullet discharged from a gun or pistol makes but an orifice in a pane of glass sufficient for its passage, so did Jonathan Wild pass through Ihe window on to the balcony beyond. Felix Heron did not know there was a balcony. Had there not been one there, that would have been the end of Wild's infamous career. \"How so?\" \" I had information that the female named Edith Heron was in c implicity with the notorious high wayman, Captain Felix Heron as he is called, and from a warrant granted by Sir John Fielding, she is now in the hands of the police.\" \"Indeed!\" Stunned for the moment, and fully believing tbat he was kUled, Jonathan lay amid the wreck of the window. \" Yes, my lord, and that is aU I have to do in the matter, on my oath.\" \" You are not on your oath. Josathan Wild,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater ; \" and it is perhaps well for you you are not, as the pUlory has only recently een the reward of a perjurer.\" Wild elevated his ey ebro ws and pretended to look as om'sbed. The Lord Chief Justice did not even turn round, but continued, as if nothing had happened, looking at the painting over the chimney-piece. \"None so blind as those who will not see,\" was the proverb that might well have been applied in this case. Lady Castleneau caught Heron by the arm as she said, \" Enough, Felix\u2014 enough, dear Felix ! That will do !\" \"ViUain I\" said Lady Castleneau; \" I do not know \u00bb hat your precise object may be iu this hos tility to the Countess of Whitcombe, but you know as well as 1 do that she is as innocent as an angel can be of aU wrong I\" \" I am-delighted to hear it, madi al\" replied Wild. \" And, at the same time, I boj 9 I see yon in a perfect state of health and salubrib '.\" \"Wretch!\" \" Thauk you, madam; you are very kind.\" The Lord Chief Justice held up bis hai d to put a stop to the semi-altercation, and spoke quietly. \" The answer is sufficient,\" he said, * for the present; and Mr. WUd is discharged from further attendance.\" She found that he might still pursue the vUlain WUd to his absolute death ; and she had a strong desire and presentiment that Jonathan should be banged at Tyburn, which she did not wish to be disturbed by his death, even at the hands of Heron. The young Earl of Bridgewater saw that it was time for Heron to leave the room, and the house. \" Come,\" he said \u2014 \" come ; all is done here that can be.\" Felix Hwon felt tbe fuU weight of these words, and casting a glance towards tho Lord Chief Justice, which that personage probably saw in ft smaU mirror which hung by the side of the ohim- \" Nay, one moment!\" _ried the Earl of Bridge-"], [382, "EDITH HEK0N- 376 But we return to Felix heron. Lady Castleieau hurried iuto her ciacn ; but the Earl of Bridgewater did not thiuk it safe for Felix Heron to take a seat iu so remarkable a vehicle as that now that his arch foe, Jonathan Wild, knew that he was in London. \" No \" he said, \" you come with me, Wfiit combe: Lady Castleneau will go bome by herself, and we will bid ber ?ood-by\u00bb till the even ng ' \" It is well advised,\" sain Lady Castleneau.

His countenance worked as though he were half choked, and it was evident what great efforts he bad to make to keep down tbe rage that possessed him. \" From which we will save her!\" Heron grasped the baud of the Earl of Bridge water, as, in a voice of emotion, he said, \" What should I do in the world without a friend line you?\" , Conversing in this strain, they reached the town house of the young Eirl, where at all events Heron would be in compara ive safety from pur suit. _ Even Jonathan Wild, with all his effrontery, would scarcely think it safe to trouble a nobleman of the Earl's standing wilh an assault upon his mansion He succeeded. \" I can well premise, my lord, that lam your lo dsbip's most obedient humble servant.

Mourning at one moment for her child, and ihe next arming herself with wh*t courage she could call to aid her to meet any fate. It was, however, much to the surprise of Edub that she heard the sound of several voices in tbe house where she was a prisoner. Manacled, as she bad been, to tbe chair, whicn Jonathan WUd had fastened the handcuffs to, she had no power to look from any of the windows. Yet she could see that the full, broad daylight bid come, for it made its way in narrow pencUs of ligt-. t through many crevices. Altogether Edith had not been above four hours tbe ptisoner of Jonathan Wild before she beard voices in tbe old deserted hou-e, where she bad1 expected only to be visited by the hat.d Jonathan him- elf- Thou tbe room door was opened, and the j .ni\u00ab sary, ;o whom Wild had given instructions at Sir John Fielding's, stepped into the room, speakiug as he '-me, head.

Edith was no longer in his power. That is to eay, she was not in his power to the extent that she had beeu ; and therefore be bai not the opportunity of making the terms with Felix Heron that he intended. Bat still all was not lost. At that time the administration of justice in its minor details was not bo precise as it is now. The judges were probably quite as upright men as now, bat all the delaUs of the practice of the courts were tainted by a rottenness and a corruption that was perfectly terrible lo con template. From all that evU Jonathan Wild gathered hope No one knew so well as he how to manage a trial. How to get up evidence on ono side or the other; and even ia the case of an absolute ccrs vicsion, it was far easier for Wild^ to savo tha criminal than for any ot>\"T man ia England 10 us \" Hare you are, mates.

The Bow Street officer made tbe best of his way out of her sight so soon a\" be bad fairly de livered her to the authorities of the Compter; for he did not want to give any change out of the diamond ring, whioh, at its true value, would about have purchased five times over the coach and its two horses that conveyed her from White hall to the City. A feeling of great desolation came over Edith as she was conducted to the interior of the prison ; but it was only when she happened to hear a young ohild of one of the female warders crying and wailing for its mother, who was about on some duty, that her spirits entirely gave Way. Then tears forced themselves to the eyes o. Elith. Toe girl, as she spoke, handed to Edi h a little bead p irse in which were some guineas \u2022' g \u00bbld.

But the kindly tone of the young woman had been appreciated When Edith was about to be left alone in a cell, she asked tbe warder who it was that had spoken to her.

Elith, therefore, was provided with some money, and was as well situated as she ould \u00abxprct to be considering that she was a prisoner, and charged with a serious off . lo. \" Oh, that's Martha,\" was the reply. \" Aud who is she?\" \" The keeper's niece, she is.\" \u2022' Can I speak to her ?\" \" I suppose so ; but \" The man held out his hand in a significant man ner, and then Edith began to comprehend that nothing whatever was done, that a prisoner would have done in that place, without a bribe. \" I have no money\" \" Oh, very good ! \u2014 I mean very bad!\" Bang went the door shut and Edith heard the massive lock shot into it's socket WhUe all thii was going on in regard to Edith, Jona'han Wild was not idle; aud it was ou his own accord that he caused to be writ en, for he would not trust his own band- writing to Felix Heron, the foUowing letter ; \u2014 \" To Captain Felix Hrron. \"One who is dearer to Captain Heron than his own life wiU die at Tyburn, if he, Captain Heron, ohooses. \" He may save her. \" How ?

WUd then bethought him of paying a visit to the wretched Lord Warringdale, who was, in truth, as much a prisoner in the bouse called Little New gate, as E lith was at the Compter, within a stone's throw of it. \" He wUl 1\" \"No\u2014 no! \u2014 a thousand times, no!

Ediih wiU not perish, neither will Captain Felix Heron, as he is oalled, sign any suoh paper.\" A dark look came over WUd's face. Lord Warringdale's wounds were not dangerous, bnt they were irritating, and a good deal of pain had taken place. When Wild stepped into the attic, the wounded man was tossing bis arms about, and, in a half sleep, muttering to himself, \" Oh, fool I fool ! fool ! How mnch better to have been to him what would have made all happy \u2014 all \u2014 all happy ! What am I now but a dying wretch !\" \" Oh !\" said Wild ; \" so my Lord Warringdale has a fit of repentance.\" Warringdale heard his voice. An accession of terror came over him \"Off, off, fiend, off!\" he yelled. \"It is you who walk, the world seeking whom you may de stroy; and you have destroyed me, body and soul \u2014 body and soul !\" \" You don't say so !\" \"Help, help! Murder!\" \" Go en.\" \" The fiend\u2014 the fiend !\" \"Just so. There is one comfort, and that is, you may make as much noise as you like here, and no one cares a jot.\" Warringdale groaned. \"Well,\" said Wild, as he took off the long, charred snuff of the candle with his finger, \u2014 * well, are yon going to get a Uttle more reason able now?\" \"If I thonght you were right,\" he said, \" what do you think I would do ?\" Lord Warringdale shook his head. \"Do you want to know,\" added Wild, \"or not?\" \" Some horror 1\" \" WeU, yon may call it that I would smother you now, at this moment, with the pillow that is nnder your head !\" Warringdale shuddered. WeU he knew that this was no idle threat on the part of Jonathan Wild, if he should think that his interests would not suffer by it \" Now, my Lord Warringdale, what say you to that ?\" \" I am \u2014 I am \" \" What ?\" \" In your power !\" \" Ha ! ha !

With a cry of triumph, Lord Warringdale stepped ont of the bed on the other side ; and then Wild looked up, and said, \" Bo !\" Lord Warringdale feU to the floor. \" Ha ! ha !\" langhed Jonathan. \" I left that pistol under your piUow myself, loaded with a small quantity of powder, just to see if you would try to take my life with it I I am scorched a little, though I did hold up my arm ; and now \u2014 now, my Lord Warringdale Ha ! ha !

JONATHAN WILD LEAVES WARRINGDALE FOR DEAD IN THE PRISON ATTIC. heaven!\" A convulsive movement oame over the limbs of Lord Warringdale, and then, with a long-drawn deep sigh, he appeared to yield his spirit to his maker. A gleam of hope shot through tbe heart of Lord Warringdale, and he cried out aloud, \" Yes, spare mo I spare me ! Let me still live, and I will do as you wish\" This was tbe exact frame of mind that Jonathan Wild wanted to bring him to. Tbe fear of death was the only thing that could act with sufficient force upon the heart and brains of Lord Warring dale to make him sign the document which Jonathan considered so essential to his own inte rests. Wild was taken by surprise. \"Can this be possible?\" he said. \"Dsad! Is he dead ?\" Stooping low over the bed, Jonathan looked into the pale, ghastly face of his companion in so many crimes ; and as he so looked, the convio tion came across him that the attic then only contained one living mau, and that was himself. Wild was perplexed. \"Confound the fellow,\" he muttered; \"who would have thought now that he was about to slip away so easily as this ? What wUl it be best to do now, I wonder?\" Jonathan paced the attic to and fro with hi_ hands behind his back, and after about three minutes he made np his mind to a course of action. \" Be it so, then,\" he said, as he stepped off the prostrate body of his wretohed associate and victim. \" Be it eo, and the time will still eome when even you will admit that by forcing you to do as you wiU now do, I only act in your own interest\" Warringdale groaned. It was difficult to believe that to be half mur- \" Very well, that must be it,\" he said. \"If I cannot work with one of them I must with the other. So be it He has escaped me, and it is now FeUx Heron to whom I must look for the estates of Whitcombe.\" dered was iu bis favour. Jonathan WUd now raised the prisoner to his feet, and replaced him in the bed. \" You wiU soon be better,\" 6aid WUd ; \" and now, my lord, you wUl append to this paper your signature. Here is a pen. There, I'll dip it in the ink for you, and you have but to write.\" \" The paper!\" in aned Lord Warringdale: \" is it the one you spoke of ?\" \"Itis!\" After, then, another long look in the face of Lord Warringdale, Wild took out of his pocket a ponderous watch that he usually wore, and held the glass to the lips of the wretched Warring dale. Hastily looking, then, at the glass, he saw that not the slightest film of breath was npon it \"Ah! he is dead fast enough. Well, I can't help it. Let him go!\" Wild whistled an air as he left the a'tic, and any one might have thought that be meant the common ribald tune as the requiem of the man whom he had helped to do so much evil. But Jonathan WUd did not negleot to lock the attic door, and as soon as he reached the hall of his house, he called one of his men to him, and gave him an order. \" Hark yon, Mumbles, you are to get a sheU from Mr. GUes, the undertaker, in East Smith field, and at midnight ark me for the key of the attic, and you wiU find some one there who wants to be boxed up.\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" \" You will then take the shell to the burying grouud of the new chapel in Tottenham Court Road, and get it under ground.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild I\" Jonathan WUd still whistled the tune as he left his house. \" And a \" \" It expresses what I said. It contains a formal statement, that although you are the son of the late Earl of Whitcombe, yon were not born in wedlock.\" \" Bnt\u2014 but \" \" Well\u2014 what is it?\" \" If I do not get the title and esta'es, how are you to enjoy the latter, according to our agree ment ?\" WUd made a gesture of impatience. \" I am quite sure,\" he said, \" that I have al ready explained all that fully. The intent and meaning of this document is only that it should be kept in terror over you, in case, when yon do get the title and properties of Whitcombe, you should feel inclined to forget there is such a person in tbe world as Jonathan Wild.\" Lord Warringdale signed the piper. \" It is done.\" \" Aud a good job, too.\" said Wild. \" You have saved your life by this.\" \" Which means that had I not so signed it you would have murdered me ?\" Wild made one of his hideous faces. \" Murder is an ngly word, bnt I am tbe least particular man in all the world, my lord, so yon may call it that if you like.\" A shudder passed over the frame of Lord WarriDgdale, and by the dim light In the attic. Jonathan WUd saw that he turned of a deadly p_len.es. But he was not aware that at that moment Lord Warringdale was sitting np in the wretched truckle bed, and glaring towards the attic door, whUe all his senses were absorbed in the one of listening Tbe effort to hold his breath while Jonathan had placed the watch to his lips had nearly choked Lord Warringdale."], [387, "381 EDITH HERON. Another moment, and he must have given it up. As it was, however, he had decsived tbe thief taker, and he still lived. Bnt how to escape? That was now the all important question How was he to elude Jonathan Wild and his myrniiloms? If Warringdale had been aware of the course that Wild intended to pursue, iu regard to his sop posed d...d body, he would have had no great difficulty in making np his mind as to a course of act on that, in all probability, would be successful. But he had no means of knowing that So far as his information extended, and she likelihoods of the case went, it appeared to him that being supposed dead by Wild, he wonld be left to rot in that attio without any further noice. \" Now for it!\" eaid one of the men. Warringdale kept his eyes shut, and be found himself lifted by the head and the heels, and put into tbe coffin on the floor. The two men then, who were two of the janis saries of Jonathan Wild, took up the coffin, and carried it in a lumbering manner, down to the passage of the house. They then tied on the lid with a cord, and hoisting the coffin, with its still living occnpant, into a chaise-cart in Newgate Street, they flung some straw over it, and off they went Lord Warringdale found that plenty of air made its way to him. Mr. Giles, the undertaker of East Smithfield, was not particular iu regard to 'he joinery of the \" shell\" that he sent to Mr. Wild's honse. The knot holes and the crevices were abundant He rose and crept towards the door. Fast\u2014 quite fast, and beyond bis enfeebled powers to force. In the excitement of the terrible interview be had had with Jonathan Wild, Lord Warringdale had scarcely felt his wounds. But now that he was alone again the pain of them came back to him, and he was so faint, in reality, that it was with difficulty he could crawl back to the wretched bed again. How long he lay there, iu a sort of semi-trance, Lord Warringdale knew not, but from what, when he partially recovered, he found was taking place about him, he might fairly consider it had been many hours. The gleam of a lantern was in the attic. The sound of voices, speaking iu low subdued accents, was there. Warringdale listened. \" Well, what is it to us ? \" said one voice ; \" Mr. WUd will settle aU that We have the job to do.\" As the chaise-cart, too, was driven rapidly through the ool night air, Lord Warringdale found himself rather in a draught than otherwise, for tbe wind whistled about him. ' This process, then, which might under more adverse circumstances, have b en one almost of suffocation, was actually of benefit to Lord War tingdale, for the cool night air revived him. The cart soon stopped at the then new chapel in Tottenham-court Road. With the least possible ceremony, the chsise cart was backed right across the pavement to tbe iron railings of tbe burial-ground. A clock struck one. Tbe now busy thoroughfare of Tottenham Court Road, which at no hour of the night is suffi ciently without its passengers to allow of the un observed enacting of such a scene as that which Jonathan Wild's two men were carrying out, was then literally deserted. A solitary watchman dozed in his box at the corner of Francis Street. \"Did I say we wouldn't?\" growled another voice. \" Now, don't be tnlky I\" \"Did I say I was?\" \" WeU \u2014 well! come on and let's put him in at once !\" The two men took off the cord, which only held on the lid of the coffin, and then they overset it, and Lord Warringdale was let fall as heavily or as lightly as the circumstances might permit, on to the soU of the grave-yard. Upon the mound of a new made grave he feU; and although he felt a shock he was not hurt. \" That will do,\" said one of the men. \" Did I say it wouldn't?\" growled tbe other. \" Oh! good gracions I Of all the contradictory wretches that ever lived yon are about the worst !\" \" Did I say I wasn't?\" \" Come along, do.\" \" No you don't !\" oried a voioe. \" You are body-snatchers, I can see; and I nab you and take you np.\" Tbat wag the watohman from the other side of tbe way, who, having opportunely wakened up, saw the chaise-cart by the railings ol tbe grave yard, and ran over to reconoitre. \" HUloa! Is that yon, Charley ?\" said one of the men. Lord Warringdale was afraid to open his eyes wide enough to let these men see that be still lived. By a sort of instinct, considering that it was the best and the safest course for him to pur sue, he lay profoundly still. But yet he managed to see, to a slight extent, about him. What he did see was enough to fiU his mind with horror. A coffin was on the floor of the attic Lord Warringdale conld stand almost anything bnt that; and, but that one of the men made a re mark that changed his state of mind in regard to it, he woBld have at once spoken, and let them know tbat he was not yet a subject for the tomb. \" Very well,\" said one of the men ; \" a crown is ft crown, and I, for one, don't despise it, if Mr. Giles will give that for the ooffin back again ; bnt in that case we must not fasten down the lid.\" \" Did I say we should ?\" \"Oh, don't go on in that way, but listen to reason. It will be easy to tumble the body over the raUings of the chapel yard, and then take the coffin to Mr. Giles.\" \" Did I say it wouldn't be easy?\" Lord Warringdale, from all this, saw a chance for life and for liberty. He spoke not He moved not \" Don't be Charleying me \u2014 I wants my regulars ! If so be as you have snatched a body, why in a way of speaking, you must pay a body, meaning me, or else I shall take you up.\" \" We haven't done any suoh thing. It's a ghost in the ohapel yard.\" \"A ghost?\" \" Yes Don't you see it?\" \"Murder!\" The watchman had incautiously put his face close to the irou rails, which were too close to gether to let bis head go between them nnder ordinary circumstances ; but the moment he was"], [388, "EDITH HERON. 382 The oharge against ber was specific enough. \" Aiding, abetting and comfortiog a felon.\" Was not Felix Heron the felon ? in that position, one of Jonathan';) men made the rarcnmstan'-ei extraordinary, by giving the watch man's head such an impetus from behind, that it went between the iron rails at once. To get it back again would require such another blow on the other side, and then, perhaps, it would not have succeeded, inasmuch as his head went in wedge-shaped, and was not at all so weU adapted to coming back again. \" Murder\u2014 murder!\" Did not Edith aid, end \u2014 if not abet\u2014 did she not comfort him? Yes \u2014 In the full sense of the word ; and therefore was it that Wild looked for a conviction as certain. But he was resolved to make assurance doubly sure ; and, as an illustration of the mode in which that notorious personage worked out hi i ends by the aid of the criminal laws, we proceed to show the reader how he did it Off drove the chaise-cart. \" Murder\u2014 murder !\" Lord Warringdale had by this time scrambled to bis feet, aud seeing the watchman's bead and face in the grave-yard, he thought himself in danger, and flung a double handful of earth at him. It was ju*t possible that a jury might be relno tant to convict tbe fair young wife for being true to ber husband, let him have done what he might ; so Wild played a deeper game. He was determined that the actual complicity of Edith in some highway robbery by Felix Heron should seem to be apparent beyond aU dispute, by her possession of some portion of the plunder. Nothing could be easier to Jonathan Wild than the management of a little transaction Uke this. It was exactly in his particular line of business. The fabrication of evidence one way or the other, as it suited his wishes or his interest, was one of those things by which Wild existed. We shall see, therefore, how, at the trial of poor Edith, the arch villain carried out his plans. Nothing like the amount of public interest was at that time exoited by the trial and possible con demnation to death of suoh a person as Edith that would now have been evoked ; and although on the morning that Edith was brought into court on an indictment framed and promoted by the law-officers of the Crown, there was certainly a crowded anditory, yet tbe people regarded her with but a passing interest Edith was pale. There was a shade of languor and anxiety in her face. \" Murder I The ghost I\" The watchman felt quite convinced that he saw an apparition, and fright and pain overcame him so that he fell to the ground, his neck sliding down between the two iron rails as if it were in a groove. Warringdale fled across the grave-yard to the street at the back, and then, by an effort which, under ordinary circumstances, he would have been quite incapable of, he cUmbed the waU and found himself at freedom. Then another watchman \u2014 who, on that side of the grave-yard, had heard some alarm\u2014 made a rush at Warringdale, and seized him by tho arm. \"Let me go!\" \" No, by jabers ! \u2014 not if Mike Clancy knows it!\" \"Idiot!\" \" The same to yon, and many of them ! Is it a body-snatcher ye is?\" \" No\u2014 a ghost 1\" \"A ghost?\" \" Yes ; I have just come out of the grave !\" \" Then I'U keep a hold of you till Mrs. De laney's oock orowi. She's the greengrocer beyant the lamp- post yonder, and keeps chickens; and then when the ould oock crows, it's back you wUl have to go agin I\" \" Fool I\" It happened, too, that at the moment she entered the court, a little child, iu one cf the gal leries, cried, and the sound struck the heart of Edith, who, herself a mother, had her thoughts even then with her own Uttle one at Epping Forest Lord Warringdale was wUd with rage and ex citement He snatched from the hands of the watchman his tbiok cudgel, and with one blow of it he stretched the guardian of the night to tha earth. Edith then uttered a responsive cry, and looked anxiously abont her. Then a flush of joy lit up her face, for her eyes had met those of the very dearest lo her on earth. She saw her hnsband. The next aot of Warringdale was to strip the watchman of his huge blanket great-coat, whioh he put on himseU, and then he sled from the spoi- lt was by a sort of instinct, rather than from any settled purpose, that Lord Warringdale took his way to St. James's Street, and paused on tbe door step of Whitcombe House. Put his surprise, on finding the huge hall-door yield to his touch, and slowly creak open, was very great Another moment, and he stood in the hall of tbat family mansion of the Whitcombes. Felix Heron was there There, disguised as an aged man, and so weU got up, as the theatrical phrase is, that no one could have recognised him but with the sharp gaze of affection. It did not, however, take Edith a second glance to know him; and she felt that she was far \u2014 very far from being abandoned. It had been with the greatest difficulty that Heron had been, by his dear friend the young Earl of Bridgewater, persuaded to risk the issue of the trial of Edith before making some desperate til'oit to release her. Indeed, if the proceedings had not been all so rapid as they were, he could not have found patience to wait; but he did yield, making up his mind at the same time that if she were not re s ored to him by the verdiot of the jury, that he would pull Newgate to pieces stone hy stone for her release, if that were the ouly mode by which it could be accomplished.

But now let us attend to this trial, which was got up by the infamous aud unscrupulous Jona than Wild f ir the sole purpose of aiding him in his own _.\"elfid'\u00bb purposes. Aud, iu ord-r that we may fee more olearly what tho'e o'j ctl were, it is necessary tbat we should beep the court waiting some few minutes while we state what tcok place in Newgate at the eaily hoar of six on that even'ful morning. By tho iufiu- uce of Jonathan Wild, Edith had, en tbe ui_ht before, been removed from Giltspur Strep' (\\ i.pter to Newgate. There the was placed in a ceU, tee very aspect of whi h waj calculated to greatly depress hor spirits On its walls were scratebings and drawings, made with the end of a burnt stick, of people in ali the agonies of suffocation by the ooid at Ty burn. Edith clapped her hands together with joy. * Ah I\" she oried, \" now I know that you have no such information as you pretend to, and that alt i\u00ab well.\" Wjl i uttered an oath. \" Aud now,\" added Elith, \"I know better still aud I defy and scorn you.\" By a great effort Wild smothered bis chagrin. \" Very well he said ; \" be it as you p'eaee. It makes no difference to me iu the world. The paper was only to the effect that you forgave my cap'u.e of you, in consideration that I had re pented of it That is all.\" \" Let me read it\" \" No ! If yon cannot trust me, I feel too much hurt to say another word about it.\" \" Be it so, then,\" replied E lith. \" I will rather take what cbanee the law affords me, than trust to one word from the lips of so treacherous a monster as Jonathan WUd.\" At these words, Jonathan WUd could not refrain from a howl of rage. \" Perish, then, in your obstinacy !\" he said \" You know not the fate that is in store for you, because you think you will escape the fatal tree st T j burn; but the hemp is already twisted that shall stop yonr breath!\" To ihis vituperative speech Edith disdained to reply ; and she was grateful to see that the shadow of Jonathan WUd was no longer on the waU of tbe cell. Dogsrrel ver?es, too, were appended, and it was clear to Eiith that she was in one of the condemned celts of Newgate. It was part of Jonathan Wild's policy to press thus heavily upon the imagination of his captive. A grated window above the door of tha cell\u2014 if, indeed, it ould be called a window \u2014 admitted a dim light from the long stone corridor beyond ; and it was at hat grating Edith became conscious there was a human face. It was the face of WUd. _ Tnat the letter which Wild wished Edith to sign was one requiring Felix Heron, for the love he bore her, to give up aU oontest f r the earldom of Whitcombe, there can be no donbt. And now once more we find ourselves in the court of the Old BaUey. He spoke in bis hoarse, harsh, grating tones to her. \"E^i'li Heron, you may think that I am a man who scrup'es not at any means to cowpass my ends; but there is one point upon which I am accessible to tbe most kindly emotions.\" Edith shuddered, bit she did not reply. \" I am a father,\" added WUd, with a hypo critical wbiue. \" Yes, I have a son ; and the feel ings of a father are such that they make me have a sympathetic pity for you; and as your Uttle child at the forest is dying \" Edith shrieked. The judge is on the bench. Edith Heron is at the bar. The jury are assembled. The crier shouts his monotouons \" Hush !\" and the trial commences. But before the counsel who was to open the case could rise to speak, a gentleman appears through the private door that opens on to the bench. He is in company with the Lord Mayor, who wears his gold chain of office. The gentleman is a young and handsome man, aud as he appears, the colour heightens in the face of Eiith, and tears start to her eyes. S he feels that she has, in addition to her Felix, a dear friend present. That gentleman who came in with tbe Lord Mayor is none other than the nob'e and chivalrous Earl of Bridgewater. Surely in all this there was hope for Edith. She could not \u2014 she would not despair while in one direction she conld look into the eyes of Felix Heron, and in another she could beuold the kindly countenance of the Earl of Bridgewater. Hut now all Edith's attention was concentrated to the trial, and to the remarkable statement which was made by the counsel who conducted the pro secu'ion. \"Ah!\" thought Wild, \" that will do.\" \" Yes,\" he added ; \" as your little one is dying, and in its Ut moments wailing for its mother's caresses, to soothe the pangs of dissolution, I cannot find in my heart to keep you longer a prisoner.\" \" Oh, heaven!\" sighed Edith. \" Aud so,\" added WUd, \" you shall go at once. I can di\u00abguise you so that, as one of the female domestics of tbe prison, you can escape.\" \" Dare I believe you ?\" \" That is as you please.\" \" Prove your sincerity, then, by the act Let me feel that I am free from this prison, and on my route to Epping Forest\" \" Certainly\u2014 take this I\" \u00ab What is it ?\" \" Only a paper and a pen.

To be found in the evU look of Jonathan Wild as be pr. j et, d into (he ceU the paper with one hand, aiist a pen with the other.

Then be proceeded. \" My lord and gentlemen, the accused stands in the position of being the wife of a notorious highwayman ; and it is as weU now \u2014 although the eminent judge whom I have now the honour to address will do so much be ter \u2014 I say, it is as well now that I should say a few words in regard to the law in respeot to the complicity of a man's wife in that man's felonies. \" 1 do, my lord.\" * Well, what do you wish to object to ?\" \" To the statement of my learned friend here, that he is to make charges against the prisoner at the bar, and that the prisoner is to find evidence to dispose of them. Such is not the law. It is the duty of my learned friend, if he makes aUega tious, to find the evidence to support them if he can ; not that of the prisoner, to prove the nega tive.\" The counsel for the prosecution bit his lips. The judge inclined his head, as he said, \" That is quite correct\" \" My lord,\" said the proseouting counsel, \" I am afraid my learned friend for tbe defence cries out before he is hurt, but I shall prove whatever I state.\" \"Pray go on, then,\" said the judge. \" On the prisoner's finger, then, my lord and gentlemen, was Mr. Brydges's ring, which he will swear to ; and as there are two counts in tbe indictment against the prisoner, one for aiding, abetting, and comforting a felon, and the other for being in possession of stolen property, the jury can conviot on either, or both, as they think fit. \" Or acquit on both, or either,\" said the young oounsel. \".Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar is not ao cused of highway robbery, but of comforting, aiding, and abetting a highway robber; aud a further charge consists in the possession of stolen property. \" She is not arraigned before you for any act which she could and must necessarily do, under the control of her husband, but for the after-pos session of the proceeds of his robberies, which will, I apprehend, bring her within the reach of the law on this occasion. \" Call Mr. Thomas Brydges !\" shouted the pro secuting counsel, who was fast losing his temper at these interrnptions to what he considered his eloquence. A well-dressed, burly-looking man got into the witness-box, but it hardly required a second glanoe to see that, in the first place, tbe clothes he had on did not fit him, never having been made for him; and iu the second place, tbat he was very nneasy from some canse or another. But this man was sworn, and the counsel ex amined him. \" Gentlemen, there was, and there is, a respect able mercantUe gentleman, of the name of Brydges, who will appear before you this day, and inform you that he was in possession ef a diamond ring, of the value of sixty pounds, and that he was coming from Oxford, in the regular mail coach, when abont eight miles from London the vehicle was stopped by a highwayman, and he, among other passengers, was robbed. \" The diamond ring in question was taken from him, and no trace of it could be found until the prisoner now at the bar was apprehended for com forting, aiding and abetting a felon ; and then it was found on her finger.\" At this audacious statement, Edith conld keep sUent no longer. \"No \u2014 no!\" she cried; \" it is not so!

There wUl come a time for you to speak.\" The connsel again settled his gown upon his shoulders, and continued. \" What is yonr name, sir, and what are you ?\" \" My name is Thomas Brydges, and I am a commercial traveller.\" \" Were you at Oxford on the 15th of last October?\" \"I was.' \" Well, then, state what took place in regard to a robbery of tbe Oxford mail, in which you were coming to London on that day, or evening.\" \u00ab I will, sir.\" CHAPTER OLXVI. CAPTAIN FELIX HERON APPEALS IN VAIN TO THK JUSTICE OF THE CRIMINAL COURT. \" Of oourse, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, it is not to be supposed that a prisoner at the bar of this court will acknowledge all at once the truth of any allegations that may be brought against him or her ; but if , by evidence, they oan confute suoh allegations, no one will be more rejoiced than I.\" \" I beg your lordship's pardon,\" said a yonng barrister, rising at this moment, and addressing the j udge, \" but I must protest against the course pursued by my learned friend for the prosecu tion.\" It was tolerably evident to any one in the court that Mr. Brydges, the commercial traveller, was in a state of alarm about something. What it was they could not divine, bat there was one person in that conrt who could have told. That person was no other than Felix Heron. He had recognised the pretended Mr. Brydges at once as a man who had been a member of his band, bnt turned out of i', for various offences. And this man, as be rose in tbe witness box, above tbe heads of the crowd in the court, and so was able to look about him, soon saw his old Captain. No wonder, then, that the sham commercial traveUer, who had been suborned to play that part by Jonathan Wild, felt nneasy. It Is quite true tbat he might have denounced \" That is intolerable 1\" oried the counsel for the prosecution. \" I claim the protection of the bench.\" \" Do you appear for ths prisoner ?\" asked the judge, addressing the young counsel, who had in terrupted the proceedings."], [391, "EPITH IIEnON. 385 kis old Captain, and had him placed in great danger, and possibly apprehended ; bat then what would become of him, for had he not taken his oath there and then, and previously too before the grand jury, that his name was Thomis Brydges, and that he was a commercial traveller ? The danger, then, to him of Felix Heron de- claring who he was, to the full equalled, if not ex- ceeded, any danger he could bring upon Heron The singular spectacle then was presented, if any one could have known it and seen it, of the witness being terribly afraid that he should be denounced by a man for whose apprehension there was a heavy reward, which to dared not attempt to get. No wonder Brydges was uneasy. \" Now, sir,\" cried the counsel, \" we wait for joo.\" grace, Brydgna to _ the tile that Jonathan had invented for tbe occasion. \" I was a passenger by the Oxford mail on the evening of the 15 .a of October last, wheu. a' a p'ra called Beechey Hollo w, it was stopped hy a highwayman.

Jo\\_aiia_. Wild mnttered an oath. \u2022' Oh, that is it I\" \"Call Mr. Jonathan Wild,\" said the counsel. At the mention of that dreaded and detesta'ile name tb_re was an uneasy commotion in the coo, t, as though every one felt it necessary to shift his position, from a o.ruiu feeling ol irk someness, such as comes over people when they hear mentioned some one whom in their hearts they abhor. The ring had about as much chance of getting on to one of the fingers of Brydges as a smaU dog's collar might of Lttug a horse. \"Put it on, sir!\" Krfdgns hesitated. - Witness,\" said the Judge, \" why don't yo\u00ab comply with the wish of the oounsel? \" My\u2014 hand \u2014 is \u2014 is sweUed, my lord, and I cannot.\" It was well known tbat Wild, when he bad set his mind upon a victim, spared no pains to secure a conviction; and his presence iu the witness- box was always accepted as equal to the _eath-w__rrant of the unfortunate prisoner. Wild was decidedly unpopular. But he seemed >aih.r to enjoy, than otherwise, the murmur of execration with which he was greeted. He looked around him with a smUe \u2014 if the hideous contortion of countenance that did duty for one iu his face could be cubed suoh. Then he was sworn, and the counsel examined him. \"Let me look at the ring.\" The jewel was handed np to the Judge, who looked carefully at it \" Thin is a lady's ring. WUl yon take npon yourself, witness, to ewear that you ever had this ring on your finger ?\" \"Yes, my lord; but my hand has swelled since then.\" The Judge shook his head. \" The fact is,\" said the young barrister, \"that this is the first hour in which the witness ever saw ihe ring, which is the genuine property of the lady wbo is now falsely accused of having wrongful possession of it And now, Mr. Wild, I have a question or two to put to you.\" \" Yes, sir.\" It was part of Jonathan Wild's system always to ;. ut on an air of great candonr in a court of justice, and to be scrupulously polite to counsel. \" How came the prisoner at the bar to be appre hended?\" WUd's evidence was remarkably clear, and came to this. \" Some monthB ago I was advised by Mr. Thomas Brydges of the Iocs of a diamond ring, iu ihe robbery of the Oxford maU lost October, ivLich robbery, from information I received, I felt sure was committed by Captain Heron, us he calls limtelf.

It suits tbe purpose of Jonathan WUd that that c aim sh, old be set aside, and the only way in wbioh tbat can be doee is by a rennnciation on tbe pait of this Felix Heron, who is the husband of the pric-oner.\" \" Has all this,\" interposed tbe Judge, \" anything to do with the evidence ?\" \" Sent for you ? WUl jou swear that ?\" * I am ou my oath now.\" \" Oh false\u2014 fab e I\" cried Edith, with a shudder, for she was pai- fully affected at the cool perjury of Jonathan Wild. It was evident tbat the young barrister could make nothing of such a man as WUd. Who, indeed, except he be in po._ srion of some con clusive piece of testimony, or information which is confounding \u2014 who could make headway against the flat perjury of suoh a man as Wild? The case was actually over, but Ihe young counsel y 1 1 made an appeal to save Edith, and spoke with fervour : \u2014 \" My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, \u2014 The responsibility that I feel in this case is of a pecu liarly painful character, beoans . it compromises so n'any persons. Under ordinary circumstances it is the prisoner at the bar of and coucernicg whom a counsel may feel great anxiety and responsibility, but it is not wholly so in this case, gentlemen. * It is tine that the prisoner may be sacrificed to false testimony snd judicially murdered, and so one person may suffer ; but what can that suffer ing be in comparison with the life-long agony, aud regret of you, my lord, and of you, gentlemen of the jury, who will be the causes and the instru ments of that judicial murder?\" Tbe jury looked startled. \" Therefore,\" added the connsel, \" it is for yon that I fe.l deep'y \u2014 it is for you that I feel aontely a sense of terror and of responsibUity.\" Wild bit his lip?. He saw that an impressien was being made on tbe jury. \" In regard to the innocent prisoner at the bar,\" added the counsel, \" you can but kill her \u2014 yon oan but send her to death, from which, in aU her yonth and innocence, she wiU rise to Ufe everlast ing with the sympathy of angels ; but yon, gentle men of the jury, what wUl be your sensations when the time will come, as assuredly it wiU, in which yon wiU find that you have condemned the innocent and sent the pure and holy-minded to death ?\" \" Yes, my lord, it shows the animus and tbe motives of the prosecution.\" \" I am afraid we have nothing to do with the motives \u2014 it in facts alone that we must go by.\" \" But, my lord, I want to show that not only has Jonathan WUd invented the facts, but why he did so.\" \" Very good ; go on.\" _ \" Then, gentlemen, the objisst of this prosecu tion was and still is to force FeUx Heron to sign some document which should have the effect of at once and for ever putting an end to aU his claims in regard to the peerage.\" \" That,\" added the oounsel, \" was the object of WUd's vi6it to Newgate to see the prisoner, who did not send for him. And now I would ask you, gentlemen, as intelligent men, what can be yonr opinion of the evidence of the pretended owner of the diamond ring, who swears that he had it on his finger, and then finds that by no human pos sibUity could it be got on ? Oh, gentlemen, pause, I pray you, before you commit murder \u2014 for mnrder it will be, unless averted by some special mercy from heaven, if you consign to death the innocent prisoner at the bar.\" The counsel sat down. The Judge arranged his notes. He proceeded to sum np. \" Gentlemen, the prisoner is accused, not of stealing a diamond ring, but of being possessed of one, knowing it to be stolen. The ring is sworn to by the prosecutor, and the only point in his evidence that you should consider with care is that which turns on the point of discrepancy, where he says that he wore it on his finger, and yet now iu court cannot get it on any finger. I do not know that I have anything further to say on the case. It is one that is peculiarly the province of a jury to determine, and I leave it in yonr hands.\" The jury looked at each other in donbt \" Gentlemen, what is the testimony against the prisoner at the bar ? ShaU I tell yon ? It ii aU compressed in two words \u2014 two words that make up a name that so long as the English language shall last, will be a scandalous one \u2014 that name is Jonathan Wild!\" T be _\u25a0 o un ;_ oounsel p rinsed at Wild, who shrank before the gaze of the whole court, whioh was then directed upon him. \" Yes, that name is Jonathan Wild, and in that name is comprised all that can ba said in this case. It is the a ish and obj act of Jonathan WUd that the prisoner at the bar should be sacrificed, and there an end \" The jury turned round and consulted. Jonathan WUd passed the ring, throngh one of the ushers of the court, into the jury-box. An anxious five minutes passed away, and then the Jndge said, \" Gentlemen, is it your wish to retire ?\" \" No, my lord,\" replied a fat, greasy-looking man, who was the foreman \u2014 \" no, my lord. I am a jeweller and goldsmith, and I see that the ring ii a real diamond one.\" The Judge looked puzzled. \" I don't know,\" he said, \" that that ba* much to do with the case.\" \" Oh, yes, my lord ; and it is worth two hun dred pounds ; and it's scandalous that it should be stolen at all ; so we find the prisoner ' Guilty,' unless she wUl tell who gave it to her !\" \" I cannot take that verdict\" Wild by effort recovered his usual coolness, and held up the ring which was the subject of the in diotmeut to the jury. It was as if be would say, \" You hear all that the counsel for the prisoner is saying, bnt after all this ring is the real question.\" The counsel then coutinued. \" Let me see the ring,\" said Edith, gently. The Judge hesitated, bat at length the ring was handed to her."], [394, "388 EDITH heron. \" Ah, no I I never saw this ring before. I had a diamond ring when I was arrested, but not this one !\" \"It is sworn to !\" said Jonathan Wild. \" Prisoner,\" said the Judge, kindly, \" wiU yon, in the interests of justice, do all you can to pro- cure the apprehension of Felix Heron, the noto- rious highwayman?\" \" FeUx Heron is my hnsband I\" Tbat was tbe only reply that Edith con- descended to make to this appeal, and the tone in whioh it was spoken convinced the Judge that it would be quite useless to urge ber farther on such a point Tbe foreman of the jury then, in a fat, unctuous voice, spoke \" We find the prisoner ' GuUty,' my lord.\" A slight shade of paleness came over the face of Edith, but she said nothing. The Judge, amid the profound stillness of the court, addressed her. \" Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why the sentence of the law shonld not be passed npon yon ?\" \" Yes ! for I am innocent !\" \" Does it alw ys ?\" \" I oan uot exactly say that, but I wiU proceed at once to Windsor ; and I can help the case, I think, and if not I can get the earliest news of the deci sion.\" \" I wUl go with you.\" \" You shall, Felix. It was what I was abont to propose to you. It wUl be dark in another half hour. It wiU take ns two honrs and a half to go to Windsor, and by that time the state dinner of the King wUl be over, and he will see the Judge according to his custom. I, as a Privy Councillor, shall get admission to the royal cabinet, and that is one point gained.\" \" It is \u2014 it is ! Oh, let us monnt, and be off ! I cannot rest here \u2014 I feel as if I could not breathe in the honse. Perhaps in the open air I ihaU be better.\" \" No doubt \u2014 no doubt ! If we start now, we can trot our horses all the easier.\" In ten minute, more the Earl of Bridgewater and Felix Heron were mounted, aud on their road to Windsor. They both felt that for Edith's sake it was tha greatest of all possible obj.cts to keep Felix Heron ont of danger. The devioe they adopted to do this, was a good ene. \"Is that aU?\" \" It is all, and shonld be sufficient !\" The Judge shook his bead. He was not a bad man ; bnt he was hardened against human suffer ing by long practice in the position he held ; and probably he was more inclined, as a consequence of his experience, to take a bad view of human nature than a good one. \" My duty, then, is simple enough, although necessarily painfnl. It is to pass upon yon the sentence of death !\" Heron attired himself, by the assistance of the yonng lord, in a complete suit of livery of the Bridgewater pattern, so that he looked like a groom, following his master, the young Earl. To be snre, if any one had looked narrowly at Felix Heron, they wonld have wondered that any groom conld have so much the appearance of a gentleman ; but then, perhaps, if that person had been ot a reflective turn, he might have re membered how many gentlemen scarcely look so well as their grooms. Heron was mounted on Daisy. The Earl of Bridgewater had rather recom mended him to take a horse from his stables, but Heron conld not make up his mind to part with Daisy, npon whose speed and wonderful sagacity he knew so well he could rely. The Earl and Felix Heron, while they were in the streets of London, took good care to keep np the semblance of master and man. The sentence was passed. At tbat time the criminal laws were adminis- tered with a severity that made such sentences too common to produce much sensation. But Edith sought the eyes of FeUx Heron. A bright, beaming smile shone npon his face, and she felt that she was safe. The Earl of Bridgewater said a few words to the Judge, who made an affirmative gesture ; and so the trial ended. Heron rode abont fifty paces in the rear of the Earl. CHAPTER CLXVII. But when they got into the open country the necessity for that caution no longer existed, and the Earl of Bridgewater drew rein, and waited for Felix Heron. rELIX heron and the earl of bridgewater concert measures for edith's safety. In one of the handsomest rooms of the town mansion of the yonng Earl of Bridgewater that nobleman sat with FeUx Heron- \" Felix,\" he said, \" did you notice that when we left my house an ill-looking fellow came ont of a doorway, and set off at great speed ?\" * I did not. What do yon fancy from that?\" \" Only that from the gUmpse I oanght of his face, I feel sure it was the rascal who pretended to be the commercial traveUer who owned the ring at tbe trial.\" \" Then he is one of Jonathan Wild's men ?\" \" No doubt of that\" It is tbe evening of the day of the trial of poor Edith. A look of intense suffering was on the face of Heron. But perhaps the state of his mind was more shown by his inability to remain in one attitude more than half a minute than by his looks. His anxiety was intense. The young Earl placed a hand gently upon his shoulder. \" There is danger. Wait one moment, if yon please, Bridgewater.\" \" What for ?\" \" I am looking to the priming of my pistols, with a conviction on my mini that I shall have to nse them.\" \" Peace, peace, dear friend !\" he said. \" Do yon suppose, for one moment, that we wiU let our Edith, if you will let me call her so, suffer ?\" \" No, no \u2014 a thousand times, no 1\" \" Then be of good heart and cheer, and all will go well. The Judge has promised to make a fa vourable report to the King, and in that case the pardon foUows almost as a matter of course.\" \" Think you so ?\" \" I am certain.\" \" Then it is proper I should look to mine like wise Hilloa !\" \" What is amiss ?\""], [395, "EDITH HERON. 389 \"Whv, the bullets are withdrawn from these pistola ! \" Then ihere is treachery somewhere.\" \" I cannot make it out The only person who has the least chance of getting at my pistols is my yon. If I could wait for yon, I would ; but, as I am in a hurry, I cannot ; so good night, sir \u2014 good night I\" \" Good night !\" The strange horseman galloped on now at a speed which looked as thongh he wished to make np for lost time. \" Half a moment !\" said Heron. They both pulled up. In the sUence tbat ensued about them, they could both hear the dull, heavy sound of the horses' feet upon the road ; and then the sounds suddenly ceased. \" As I suspected,\" said Heron ; \" the feUow has left the road and turned into the fields.\" \" Are you snre, Felix ?\" \" Quite. I am used to such matters, and my ears are weU educated to catch them. We are in danger, and I should advise you to carry a pistol in one hand, ready for immediate service. \" \" I wUl\u2014 I will I\" \" But still the buUeti are gone?\" \" Undoubtedly.\" \" Then your valet has taken them ont.\" \"The rascal!\" \" He has not been inaccessible to the gold of Jonathan Wild ; and the circumstance only con firms me more and more in the idea that there wUl be some attaok upon na before we get to Windsor. Here, Bridgewater; luckily I have come spare bnUets. Take them, and re-charge yonr pistols.\" \" Thanks, thanks!\" The bullets whioh Felix Heron handed to the Earl of Bridgewater were rather smaU for his holster pistol ; but he wrapped them up weU in two soraps of his handkerchief, which be tore off for the purpose, and then they fitted well. The road from London to Windsor abounded in lonely spots, whioh were well adapted for any deed of violence that might be projected. London itself at that time was bnt badly lighted by the wretched oU lamps in the streets, one half of which always went ont within the first hour ef their being Ut ; bnt the country roads were not lighted at aU. For safety's sake, at the reoommendation of Felix Heron, he and the Earl of Bridgewater did not ride abreast, bnt soUowed each other at abont six paces distance. They now approached a part of the road which, more than any other they had hitherto passed, was peculiarly calculated for a cover to any per sons meditating violence. A park paling extended on one side for abont half a mUe, over which taU trees spread their luxuriant branches far over the rather narrow roadway. On the other side there was a positive wood, which looked Uke a black cloud resting npon the face of the earth. Felix Heron felt certain that if any attack was intended upon them, it was here it would be made. This did not prohibit conversation ; and they were in the midst of some interesting arrange ments of what was to be done to save Edith, if the worst shonld come to the worst, when the ispid trot of a horse in the rear oame upon their ears. \" Let him pass, be he whom he may,\" eaid Heron. Involuntarily he laid his hand en the arm of Ihe Earl of Whitcombe, as he said, \" Stop \u2014 stop!\" Almost at the moment that the words escaped the lips of Heron, the sharp ringing report of some fire-arm awoke aU the eehoes of the night air. \" Yes \u2014 yes. Slacken speed a little.\" They did so ; but the horseman when be reached them, pulled up, and cried out, \" Gentlemen, can yon tell me which is my road to Windsor ?\" \" There is only one gentleman here,\" said FeUx Heron, \" and that is my master I\" \" Oh ! I beg pardon, I'm sure ; but it's so dark here that one conld not see Jack from Gill.\" A bright blaze of light lit np the trees on the skirt of the wood for one passing instant, and then all was dark again. \" Safe ?\" asked Heron. \" Quite.\" \" Don't speak !\" \" No\u2014 no !\" Heron uttered a dismal groan, and then whispered to Bridgewater, \" Bide on \u2014 ride on !\" \"And you?\" \" I will rejoin yon in a few minutes, be as sured!\" \" The road to Windsor lies right before you,\" eaid the Earl. \"Thank you, sir \u2014 thank you! Are you in a hurry, sir ?\" \" I am \" The Earl of Bridgewater had fnU faith in the tact and ingenuity of Felix Heron, and he rode on at once without further question. Heron dismounted and held Daisy by the bridle, moving, with her, close to the park paling on the other side of the road. \" Well, so am I ; and my horse can make as good trotting way as any ; so, as the road is so dark, and they do say there are some bad cha racters upon it, really it will be a matter of mutual protection if we ride together.\" \" Bnt I am in a desperate hurry !\" said the Eail. \" So am I \u2014 so am 1 1\" Then he uttered another dismal groan, which had all the effect hs wished, for a voice at once cried out, \" WeU done, carbine ! He's down, and the groom no donbt has ridden on.\" Heron had fully expected to find that the tones of that voice wonld be those of Jonathan Wild. \" And I can tarry for no man !\" \" Nor I\u2014 nor 1 1\" \" Then that settles the matter at once, and we cannot ride together ; for, in spite of all my hurry, my horse baa cast a shoe, and I am forced to ride easy ; so I bid yon good night, sir, and good speed !\" The strange horseman was completely non plussed by this ruse on the part of the Earl ; but it was impossible, without at once creating sus picion, or rather turning suspicion into cer tainty, for him to linger longer. * Very well, sir,\" he said. \"1 sm jorry for But such was not the case. To the best of hk belief he had never heard those intonations be fore. Then there was a rushing among the bushes and underwood that skirted the mimio forest, and the flash of a lantern oame on the road. \" Douse that, Joe!\" growled another voice. \" Do you want to bring np any one that may be on the road? Keep dark!\""], [396, "390 EDITH HERON. I \"Done for, by !\" groaned the janissary, and with those words his spiiit fled. The bullet from Felix Heron's pistol had hit him exactly in the middle of the back, and passed into his breast. The slide was immediately placed again over the lens of the lantern, and then the man who carried it came out into the road heedlessly enough. \" Where are you ?\" he asked. \" Here,\" replied Heron. \"Are you hit?\" \"Yes. Tbe grave tbat he had dng for the yonng and chivalrio Earl of Bridgewater was his own, and be lay in it, a ghaiUy objeot. Heron knew the faoe well. He had seen tha man frequently at Jonathan Wild's, and he did not entertain the least donbt bnt that these two ruf fians had been employed by Jonathan that night for the express pnrpose of tbe murder of tbe Earl of Bridgewater, on bis route to Winisor. \" Serves yon right Yon shouldn't interfere to much in other folks' affairs, my lord.\" \" Oh, oh !\" \" Where are you ? I don't see you.\" \" Over here, by the park paling.\" \" Oh, very well ! Come, now, what have you got about you worth the taking ?\" Heron only groaned again in reply to this de mand, and the man rapidly made his way over the road towards him. CHAPTER CLXVIII. The moment he got within arm's length, Felix Heron dashed forward and caught him by the throat THE PERIL OF EDITH INCREASES, AND HER LIFE SEEMS TO BE PASSING AWAY. \" Death if you cry out ! Life if you obey me !\" \"Help!\" \" Hush I\" Capta\u2122 Heron was now anxious to overtake bis friend, the Earl but he wa/i rather embarrassed to know what to do with hia prisoner The idea of letting suoh a villain go was out of the question, and yet now that he was fairly con quered and iu his power, Heron could not bring himseU to put him to death. And yet death would have been no more than a j ust retribution for his villany. The fellow was thoroughly cowed and broken spirited by his situation, and was sobbing and waUing \"Oh, tell the horse to let me go \u2014 oh, do \u2014 he wiU kill me!\" A gurgling sound came from the compressed throat of the ruffian. \" What's the matter, Joe ?\" asked the other one, from the wood. \" Is he settled?\" \" Say yes,\" whispered Heron \"Yes,\" gasped tbe half strangled murderer, as Heron relaxe hii grasp upon his throat, just suffi cient to enable him to do so. \" Cau't you biing him along, then ?\" \" Say no \" \" No,'' gasped the man again. \" A plague take yon I Didn't I bargain that I was only to help dig the hole, and that yon wonld undertake to bring him to it?\" These words were horribly suggestive. That hole, so Ughtly spoken of, could be no other than the intended grave of the yonng Earl of Bridge water. \" And what then ?\" said Heron. \" Have you not come out this night to kill ?\" \" Mercy ! mercy ! \" \" Suoh as you had ?\" \" No, no ! I wUl confess all. It was Jonathan Wild set me on.\" \" Say, come and help me !\" whispered Heron. \" Come and help me, Mao !\" \" Well, I suppose I must I\" The dim, dusky form of the other can was seen by Heron crossing the road towards him. There was but one resource. Heron pushed the man he held towards Daisy, and said, sharply, \" Hold him, Daisy !\" The ruffian uttered a shriek of dismay as Daisy caught him in her teeth by the shoulder. And then the other one took the alarm, and turned to fly bock to the wood. \" Halt ! \" cried Heron. \" It needs no confession to arrive at that truth. Ah, who comes this way ?\" \"I! I!\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater, who had not been able to control the impuls- to rid* back, after he had heard the phot with which Heron had received the other ruffian. \" In good time, my lord,\" said Heron. \" Here is yonr would-be murderer !\" \" VUlain 1\" The fellow would fain have faUen on his knees, but Daisy held him np. \" What is the meaning of it all?\" said the Eirl. \" It is just this,\" replied Heron : \" tbat this rascal has been employed by Jonathan WUd to shoot you on your route to Windsor.\" \" Then why should he not suffer death at my hands?\" He still fled. Bang ! went one of Heron's pistols ; and, with a cry, the man disappeared. Lying olose to Heron's feet was the lantern, which, although the slide was olose .1, yet, from some unavoidable crevices, sent forth a few feeble days of Ugbt that sufficiently defined where i; was \" M'rcy ! Oh, spare me! Let me live, good sire \u2014 do, and I will be your slave for life !\" \" Do you think we wonld have such a despicable wretoh about us?\" said Heron. Heron lifted it at once ; and, without looking at the mau wbo was iu the safe custody of Daisy, he ran over the road, and into the wood. At the distance of abont six paces from the out skirts of the wood, Heron came npon the brink of a pit, the size and shape of a grave, but very shaUow. \" Certainly not,\" added the Earl \" And yet, my lord, we cannot kill this fellow ; for that would be to assume tbe office of public executioner, who alone ought to deal with him.\" \" What then, can be done?\" \" At some future time, when you have more leisure, proseente him, and call me as ft witness.\" \" But bow shaU we know him ?\" Something dark lay at the bottom of it Heron turned tbe full Ugbt of his lantern upon the object, whioh then, with a writhing motion, slowly turned ronnd, and he saw the villanons features of one of WUd's bull- dogs. * By marking him.\" \" Marking him ?\" \" Yes Have yon an old thin guinea abont yon, Bridgewater?\""], [397, "EDITH HEBON. 391 \" Yes ; hers is one.\" \" That's a whim of his,'' said Heron. \" Whom do you serve !\" \"Serve, indeed ! -serve and be hat?ged! I choose to pass my time with Lord Hobart \" \" And 1 mine,\" Baid Feiix Heron, \" with the Earl of Bridgewater.\" \"Look here \u2014 look here, gentlemen all!\" oried Lord Hoba>t '\u00bb groom, as he walked round Daisy, and regarded her with admiring eyes. \" Look here\u2014 did you ever see such a beautiful creature as this in aU your life ?\" An admiring throng soon surrounded Heron and Daisy, and there seemed no danger mstfl one man stepped forward from the rest, exclaiming, \" 111 take my oath of it \u2014 I've seen this mare before, when I was in the service of Sir Philip Strange. We met her and her master on the Great Northern Eoad\u2014 and who do you think ber master was ?\" Then be so good as to hold this lantern ; and I wUl take good care that there shall be no difE onlty in knowing this feUow again amo g a thousand.\" The murderer uttered a yell of rage and pain as Fe ix Heron, with the sharp edge of the guinea, cnt in his forehead, right to the bone, the letter A. _ \" That stands for assassin,\" he said, as he emp tied the portion of powder that was in the top of a small powder-flask he had on to the wound, and rubbed it weU in with the end of the fellow's own cravat The pain was no doubt excessive ; but tbe rascal, after a moment or two, only uttered awful maledictions. \" Now,\" said Heron, \" when my friend the Eatl of Bridgewater is quite at leisure to prosecnte yon, he wUl offer five guineas reward for you, and have you in a few hours. Daisy, let him go.\" Daisy released the bleeding wretch, and he set off bowUng and swearing on his route to London, without caring to look into the wood to see what had become of his companion in iniquity. FeUx Heron mounted Daisy again, and called ont to the Earl, \" I think the danger of to-night is now past Let ns on to Windsor, for the sake of poor Edith.\" It was quite evident, from the circumstances that had occurred, to what an extent Jonathan Wild estimated the powers of mischief to his plans of the Earl of Bridgewater. Well he knew th t the young Earl's father had fallen a victim to the murderous iage of Lord Warringdale, and he was quite willing that the son should suffer for his rare and cbivalric devotion to FeUx Heron. Heron laughed as he patted Daisy on the neck. \" I can tell you that as weU as you,\" he said. \" It was Felix H*ron, the notorious highwayman of Epping Forest !\" \" The very man !\" \" Exaotly I\" added Heron ; \" and now, you see, the mare belongs to the Earl of Bridgewater I\" \" Bnt how did that come about ?\" * \" Why, my good friend, I take it that's neither your business nor mine. But if you are particu larly desirous to know, I would advise you to ask the Earl himself, aud make much of the answer you get from him !\" There was a general laugh at this, which irri tated the groom who had identified Daisy, so that, looking ouriously at Felix Heron, he said, \" If yon were not in the Earl's livery, I should say you were the highwayman himsell, for he was as near about your size, and make, and look, as any man can be!\" Tbe non-appearance of Jocatham Wild himself in this exploit was no donbt a matter of calcula tion; and nothing wonld have been easier than for him, in a very short time, to dispose of both the agents in the crime. The distance to Windsor was now little more than six mUes, and so weU mounted as were Captain Heron and his friend, the Earl, it was quite possible for them to do that in half an hour. The murderous attack that had been made had consumed nearly that period of time ; and but that they bad both started from the Earl of Bridge water's house earlier than they had intended, their ride to Windsor on that night would have been perfectly useless. As it was, they reached the OasUe even some what before the time when the young Earl could have an interview with the King. Lights were evident in some of the state apart ments of the regal residence ; and Felix Heron, in his disguise as a groom to the Earl, did net hesitate to ride into one of the court-yards, and take charge of his horse. \" Well, to tell the truth,\" said Heron, \" I am that individual ! \u2014 only I hope you won't let it go any further!\" A loud laugh responded to this assertion ; and Heron found that the truth saved him from the suspicion that an evasion of it would have engen dered. He did not feel, however, at. all inclined to part with Daisy for a moment, for well he knew that if the slightest suspicion that had been aroused should, by any accident reach a certainty, he conld monut and be off, despite all obstacles. But still the position of Heron was perilous \u2014 more so, in fact, than he had at first supposed, for a well-known officer of police was always on duty at the Castle, and might, at any moment, stroll down to the stable-yard, and cons tout Heron face to face. The exigencies of our story, however, must carry us from that stable-yard into the very pene tralium of the Castle ; and in one of the basement suite of rooms occupied by the royal family, we shall see the King seated upon one of those uncomfortably high-back chairs so much iu nse a hundred years ago ; whUe an elderly gentleman, whose scanty hair was bleached by time to a scanty whiteness, was with the lowest possible reverence handing him a packet The elderly gentleman was the Becorder of London, and the packet consisted of a folded parchment, partially slit up at the sides, so xs to make five distinct divisions, and on each of those divisions was the name and nature of the crime for which five persons had been convicted and sentenced to death on that day at the Old Bailey Sessions. Screened by some tall poplars there was a range of stables on one side of this court-yard, nsuaUy devoted to the reception of the horses of visitors arriving at the Castle on business which did not require a lengthened stay. Amid the olamour of grooms, coachmen, and postiUons which this place presented, Felix Heron thought it wonld be prudent to show him self, feeling a confidence in his disguise, and that the only thing which conld at aU excite suspicion about him would be to keep aloof. The moment he dismounted he was surrounded by several ef the stud-grooms of the royal esta blishment \"HUloa!\" cried one, \"whose groom are you? You ride a better horse than yonr master's !\""], [398, "KD-TH HERON. 392 \" The R'ght Honourable the Earl of Bridge water requests the honour of an interview with his M\u00bb; sty, on important pnblio business.\" An awful document ! A record of death ! It only needed that the King should place his finger upon one of those uatnes, aud say, \" Spare that life,\" and it was spared. It only ni eried that he should look upon those names with cold apathy and inaction, and they were all dragged to the icaffold. Tbe Recorder spoke in a lotv, soft, silky voice. He was one of the men who pamper royalty until it thinks itself something more than mortal. \" I have the houour to submit o your tfajeity's royal pleasure the names of tbe condemned pri soners who lie in your Majesty's gaol of Newgate, waiting jour royal will and pleasure.\" \" How many, Mr. Recorder ?\" * Five, your Majesty.\" \" Five ? There were eight last week.\" \" Yes, your Majesty, but as the calendar gets clear tbe number of capital offences diminish.\" The Recorder seemed to think it necessary to apologize to the King for having only five people to hang on the succeeding Monday. \" Well, well, we presume there is nothing par ticular in any of the cases?\" \" Only in one, your M-jesty, and in that the learned Jndge wbo tried the case has appended a note.\" CHAPTER CLXIX. THE ROTAL COORIER FINDS THE ROAD FROM WINDSOR TO LO\u00bbDJ\u00bb BESD.T WITH DANGKKS. If the King had been in the private apartments of Windsor Castle, it wonld not have been competent for the yonng Earl of Bridgewater to have obtruded himself upon the royal attention. But such not being the case, tha Earl had seized his opportunity, is a Privy Councillor, to be announced. Without the least idea of what the Earl came about, the King ordered him to be admitted. One glance between the Recorder and the Earl let the former know that the errand on whioh they were both there had mnch the same signi ficance. The Recorder stepped back a pace or twa The Earl if Bridgewater bowed low- \" Well, Bridgewater,\" said the King. \" Any thing about Mackenzie \u2014 eh?\" This Mackenzie was the apparition, so to speak, of the King's mind just then, inasmuch as he was a man supposed to pass all his Ufe in the concoc tion of Jacobite plots ; so that when any connoUlor sought an audience of the King at any odd time, he always imagined it might be with some news of Mackenzie. \" Ah \u2014 what does he say ? No mock sentimen tality we hope \u2014 eh, Mr. Recorder ?\" \" No, your Majesty : the case is that of Edith Herou.\" \"A woman?\" \" Yes, your Majesty, and convicted of being in unlawful possession of stolen goods.\" Tbe King looked augiy. \"Mr. Recorder, Mr. Recorder, we oan tell yon Vat shall we teU you? Donner ! Bah ! Mein Got!\" \"No, yonr Majesty. I know nothing of that arch traitor.\" \" Oh, weU, what is it then, Bridgewater '\" \" I rejoice that I am here in time to meet Mr. Recorder with the report from the Sessions.\" \"Ah!\" The King got intensely German whenever he was in a passion. \" Shall I do myself the distinguished honour of reading the note of the learned Judge to your Ma^eaty.\" \" Yah !\" The King began to suspect the truth, and he pursed np his lips with an air of resolution, as though he would have said, \" No, on that point I am firm.\" Tne Recorder read, in his blandest tones \u2014 The young and gallant Earl was not slow to see this aspeot of royalty, but it did not disoou rage him, although it made him more than ever doubtful of success. \" The Judge who presided on the trial begs, with his most respectful duty to his Majesty, to recommend it lo his Majesty's merciful considera tion.\" \" Your Majesty,\" he said, \" I come most respectfully to intercede for one of the persons on that fatal list?\" Under ordinary circumstances these words would have bten quite sufficient for a reprieve, but the King was augry. \" Mr. Reoorder, we tell you that it is these people who receive tbe stolen goods who make the thieves. We tell you that\" \" A more just observation could not have been made, your Majesty. But \" \" Take jour list \u2014 take your list, Mr. Recorder. We regret, as we always regret, that we see no reason to interfere wilh the course of justice.\" The King, with a frigid look, au i a move of the hand, wnioh put an end to the conference, if it might be so called, handed the list back to the Recorder. He i o i u ted to the parchment whioh the Recorder had lifted from the table. The Kins: made no reply. \" Your Majesty,\" added Bridgewater, \" wiU, I am sure, temper justice with mercy ; and on those occasions when it is possible, or nearly probable, that human judgment may be at fault, your Majesty wUl not run the risk of committing a judicial murder.\" \" Murder, my lord ?\" \" Yes. He who by a word conld stay the deed is guilty of it, if he utter not that word.\" \"Guilty, my lord?\" \" Yes, your Majesty, assuming any guilt at all, and as that is doubtful \" The King looked pale for a moment, and then he spoke with an air of suppressed passion, as he slowly turned aside. \" My Lord Bridgewater, onr mind is made np. We oo not intend to interfere with the progress of the law as regards this list of malefacten, and the more especiaUy as only one member of our CouncU adviies.\" A light tap at the door of tbe apartment at that moment attracted the attention of the King. It was not etiquette for him to say \" come in,\" but he wailed until about half a minute had elapsed, and tU.u the door was slowly and quietly opened, and the pige in waiting appeared. \" WeU, StUlingfleel ?

A look of triumph was on the face of Clacking ton. No doubt he had been listening, and was perfectly well aware of what was going on in the royal apartment \" My Lord Claokington,\" said the King, \" you come in good time.\" \" It moves me to the heart to hear your Ma jesty so speak to the humblest of yonr ser vants!\" \" Perhaps.\" Tap I tap ! came t wo knocks at the door. \" Who shall say,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, * that this is not providential, and that some member of your Majesty's Privy CouncU may not now be at the door ?\" The King half shnt his eyes, and the Earl thought that a sharp look of cruel cnnning shot from them as he replied, * If, my Lord Bridge water, that be another member of our CouncU, and he join you in this matter, we wUl give it further consideration.\" \" Come, come, Clackington, yon shall decide. Take that list of condemned persons \"hich Mr. Recorder has brought to us, aud say if there be any one among them whom yon would save.\" The door slowly opened.

Lord Clackington laughed in his small, byena like fashion. Tbe Recorder folded up the parchment, and made for the door. \" One moment, Mr. Ksoorder,\" said the Earl of Bridgswater. \" I want to spaak to yon before you go\" \"I will wait yonr pleasure, my lord, in the Picture GaUery.\" Tbe Earl of Bridgewater wanted to be alone with Lord Clackington, bnt the latter by no manner of means shared in the wish ; and it was only by catching him by the skirt of his coat that Bridgewater stopped him from making a precipi tate departure. \" Stop, my lord !\" \"Help!\" \"Stop, I say!\" \" M irder !\" The Recorder, however, took the proffered hand of the Earl, and pressed it tightly, as be said, \" The road by Staines is so lonely !\" In another moment he was gone. \" Yes,\" said tu\u00ab Earl of Bridgewater, as he paced tbe gallery to and fro, \u2014 \" yes that i\u00bb the only way.

Then Heron stopped, and spoke in a voice of emo'ioo. \" I\u00bb there hope?\" \" There is certainty !\" \" Thank heaven !\" \" In Bloomsbury Fields, to-m_.iT. w jtcorning, at nine o'clock.\" The Earl of Bridgewater then told him exactly wha; had happened, and Heron felt that he had the fa e, then, of bis Edith in his own hands. \" I will stop the courier,\" he said ; \" and that slip you mention of the official document that has the name of Edith npon it shall only reaoh Lon don on Monday morning, with the King's name upon it\" \" Yo\". will venture to write it, Heron ?\" \"Aibjr .dly I will!

I will meet you, and rid the world of \u2022>. monster of sin and of iniquity.\" Tbe Earl of Bridgewater hastily left the room, .ut as he went he heard old Lord Clackington chuckling, and coughing, and wheezing, as if it was the pleasantest ihing iu the world to meet in \u2022Mortal combat a man younger, by a good thirty vears, than himself. But Bridgewater did not wait to reflect npon aU this inconsistency on the patt of a mau who was well known to be a notorious coward, as he was anxious to make his way to the Recorder That functionary waited for him, as he had promised, in the Picture Gallery, which was but dimly lighted, as it w.s only used as a thorough- \" Regretfully, I must.

So let me take a sharp trot to London.\" \" Oh, my friend,\" said Heron, \" what shonld I do without yon ?\" \" Not a word more in that strain,\" said the Earl, \" but let ns oome on, and you can second me at the duel in the morning with Clackington.\" They rode from Windsor to London at good speed, meeting with no adventure by the way nntU they were within abont fonr miles of the metropolis, and then they were both aware of the rapid tread of a horse on a cross-road which they were abont te pass. The speed that the horse was making was to the fuU as quick as that at which Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater were proceeding ; although, of course, Daisy could have put forth a gaUop that wonld far have exceeded that rate. and, grasping him by the back of the neck, he said, as quietly as before, \" I do not beUeve you\" \" Ah I that's the game, is it ? \" The courier made a snatch at the saddle of his horse for one of his pistols, but Captain Heron foiled him. and dashed him to the ground. \" Lie stiU I \" he oried. The bewUdered conrier lay as flat as he conld, whUe Daisy leaped twice over him, and then Heron cried out, \" Pick him up, lass ! \" Daisy arohed her neck, and took hold of the courier by the flap of his coat, at the breast, and helped him to his feet \"Murder! Help' I'm a dead man! Help! help ! I'm murdered I \" \"Not if you are prudent,\" said Heron. \"I want to look at your despatch, that is all '' \" No, I can't \u2014 and dare not\" \" Daisy, ask him for it on his toe.\" Daisy pnt one of her fore-feet on the toe of the courier, who, with a roar of expostulation, pro duced the key of his despatch box, and took ont the Recorder's report with amazing quickness. \"Off, Daisy!\" said Heron. The unhappy courier's toe was released, and Heron handed the document to the Earl of Bridge water, saying, \" Look, 0 my friend ! and act\" \"Done!\" said the Earl in a few seconds, during which he had torn off the last slip from the report, on which was the name of Edith. A faint languid kind of light wan in the sky, which enabled them just to distinguish one object from another, and Captain Heron drew rein at the corner of the by-road with a something on his mind that he could not define. Captain Heron handed the document back to the oourier. \"Halt, Daisy!\" The noble creature stood stiU as the statue of a \" My good fellow,\" he said, \" I find this is all a mistake.

On! To town I On!\" The Earl of Bridgewater still kept amply in the shadow, so that the courier had no chance of recognising him ; and in a few minutes they were far enough away on the road to London to be out of aU reaoh of pnrsuit, even if the courier should find any one well mounted to change horses with him, and adventure suoh a proceeding. horse \"Bridgewater, I want to see who this if.\" \" And I too, Heron.\" They had no time to say more, for the horseman at once emerged from the by-road, and at sight of the two monnted personages in the highway, he caUed out, \" I hope I shaU not incommode yon, sirs, but I must have one of yonr horses on the King's service. My own horse has cast a shoe, and wUl be dead lame in another half-mile- Woa! woa I\" By the dim Ught Captain Heron saw that this man had on a faded scarlet frock-coat, across which was a broad leather strap, holding a de spatch-case of thick leather. He was booted and spurred, and it looked as if he had in the holsters of his saddle pistols. \" And pray who may yon be, my friend,\" said Heron, \" that we shonld give up a horse weU shod to yon for one that has cast a shoe ?\" \"Royal courier!\" was the brief reply. \"I de mand what I ask ; yon can refuse at yonr peril.\" \" Why, if you were the King himself, \" added Heron, mUdly, \" you could not be more peremp tory.\" \" The King's name is the same as the King,\" repUed the courier. \" Come, come, sir, be quick ; your steed wiU suit me.\" \" You are too kind Pray, before I dismount, and, of course, give it np to yon, wiU yon be so good as toll me where you are going, and what despatches you have ? \" \" To Newgate \u2014 Recorder's report I \" \"Indeed,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \"I heard at the Palace \" \"Hush!\" whispered Heron. \"One word, Mr. Conrier.\" \"What is it?\" CHAPTER OLXX.

It was now about the early dawn of the morn ing, and old Anthony informed them that he had Men, whUe working in the garden, watching several suspicions-looking men in the fields j ust beyond, and at the back of Montague House. Any circumstance of that sort was calculated to excite the attention of Heron, and both he and the Earl went into the garden and made their way to the top of the wall, where they only, however, showed so muoh of their heads as included their caps, and they were well hidden by the ivy whioh was there in abundance. A couple of low-looking vUlanous feUows were sitting down, as it happened, just nnder the wall, so that what they said, although they spoke in habitually cautious tones, conld plainly enough be heard. Captain Heron and tho Earl then made tt'eir way iuto the mansion, and the latter arranged with Herou that they should meet again at tne dusk of tbe evening, and that <n the meantime Lady Bridgewater would go to Newgate and re main with Edith. \" I cannot help thinking,\" said Heroc, \" that there was something more in those men's errand by the garden wall than appeared, since this being Sunday, they could not arrest you for tbe pretended debt\" \" Tbat very matter,\" replied the Earl, \" was ex plained to me by Colonel Trelawney, in relation to a friend of his, only a short time ago. They do arrest debtors, or pre'ended debtors, on a Sunday, and make it legal by taking a false oath, to the effect that it is only a recapture after an escape on the Saturday, which suffices to evade the law.\" \" I might have sworn,\" said Heron, \" that there was some villanous mode of settling the matter. I shall wait with aU the anxiety in the world for yon this evening. I wUl not write to Editb, lest there should be danger in it ; but Lady Bridge water wiU say for me aU that I wish.\" \" Be assured she will.\" \" Is it so ?\" asked one. \"In oourse it is,\" said the other; \"or else the governor wonld never have stood a guinea a piece to us.\" \" WeU, there is something in that, mate.\" \" I beUeve yon ; it's a good long drink for me that's in it Why, I know where to take you, where they wUl keep you drunk for a week for a guinea !\" \" WUl they ?\" \" Ah, to be sure, jolly !\" \"My!\" \" And all there is to be done is just to tap my Lord Bridgewater on the shoulder, and pass him into quod f _r a debt of forty thousand pounds, due and owing to oue Joseph Smith. Ha, ha 1\" \" That's it\" The Earl left, and Felix Heron strolled slowly into the breakfast-room at Lady Castlenean's, and sat down to wait for hercoming down, for Martha had been to apprize her of his presence. As he there sat, a strange set ling of \u2014 not ap prehension, for that word never could express the feelings of Heron in regard to himseU \u2014 bnt cf danger, came over him. The honse was very o ii 1 indeed, and, for ail the sounds that came from it, hs might have been its only inhabitant ; and yet he felt himself listening with all his attention for he knew not what I \" What does this mean, Heron ?\" asked the Earl in a whisper ; \" I don't owe forty farthings to any snch man.\" \" I can guess what it means. Hush ! perhaps we shaU hear more !\" It came at last. \" What was tbe name of the old kangaroo \u2014 eh ? \u2014 who came to the governor.\" \" Don't you know ? It was my Lord Clacking ton \u2014 one of the nobs at the Court.\" A half stifled cry ! Heron sprang to his feet Was it f anoy ? Had imagination deceived him ? \u2014 and had I e himself conjured up that cry out of the rervous ness that hod taken possession of him ? Surely yes ? No, no \u2014 a thousand times, no ! There it was again ! \" Now,\" whispered Heron, \"you know aU abont it, Bridgewater.\" \"Yes; Lord Clackington won't fight\" \" Was it likely he would ?\" \" Certainly not ; and now that I know all about it, 1 w ill disappoint those rascals, who are tipstaffs, I fancy, by not showing myself on the ground at all; and so soon as I can come across the old rascal, he shaU have a taste of the thong of my riding-whip.\" \" Better than cold thot, Bridgewater, to snch a man.\" A cry \u2014 a shout \u2014 a scream, bnt stopped and half-stifled by some means even at the moment of its escape from the human lips that formed it ! Heron was ont of the room and into the hall in a moment No one was there ! \" Anthony 1 \u2014 Anthony I\" he cried. He heard a light tapping noise, and, looking through a window whioh gave him a view of the garden, he saw the old man at work naUing np some straggling rose trees. Then the ory came again! Fainter than before ! They both descended from the wall of the garden, and at the foot of the abort ladder they had used they found Anthony, with a stable pail full of very hot water, to jndge from the steam that came from it, \"I hope, dear sirs,\" said Anthony, \" that no respectable person is just over the waU ; for here is a pail of hot water I don't want, and I am about to tUt it over the top.\" The Earl of Bridgewater laughed. \" I can assure yon, Anthony, and so can my friend here, that there is no respectable person in the way.\" \" Then here goes !\" said Anthony. He ascended the ladder, and over went the water. But there was no mistaking it. From the npper part of the mansion it came, and it was a cry for help \u2014 a cry of some distress. Heron, Ught as a roebuck, bounded up the stairs four at a time, and was on the next landing place as qnickly as though he had flown there. A suite of huge old, dreary rooms, he well knew, was there ; and he knew that lately, to avoid so many stairs to ascend, the old Lady Cas tleneau had made one of them into her bed chamber. The yeU that arose from the other side of the waU was tremendous, and the two tipstaffs ran off H if their friend and patron Old Nick himseU was at their heels. Was it from there the cry for aid had come ? Felix Heron di 1 not pause to ask hiresell that question twice over, but pushed opeu the first door"], [403, "397 EDITH HERON. that presented itself, and entered a room that was very dark, as all th* shutters but a strip of one of them were closed. so often richly deserved was about to overtake him. Heron dragged him quite up to the window, and then, holding him witn one band, he succeeded with the other in getting away from the sash one of its lines. That room was elaborately furnished in a style gone by, and Heron crossed it rapidly towards a door, the panels of which we-, richly gilt on the opposite side. Then he heard the cry again, and he heard along with it a hoarse, murmuring voice. He turned the handle of the gilt door cautiously and noiselessly. It yielded, and Heron stood in a smaU ante-room, the door of whioh was opened, and which communicated with Lady Oastleneau's bedroom. Wild must have had some idea of the possible fate in store for him, since he made the most frantic efforts to free himself from the hold of Heron. AU in vain. As weU might he have attempted to break an iron bar, as in any way even to relax the hold that Captain Heron had on his neck. But he could speak. With difficulty he could speak. \" Meroy ! Have some mercy upon me !\" \" Plenty !\" repUed Heron. \" Spare me !\" \" I mean to do so.\" The sensations of Captain Heron at this moment were strange. He felt Uke a man on the point of making a discovery of something supernatural, for he could not imagine that any natural danger was assailing Lady Castlenean in her own house. He paused again to listen. AU waa still ! \" But \u2014 bnt you don't I\" \" Yes, Jonathan WUd, I feel convinced that he whe puts you out of the world is the best friend yon oan possibly have ; because, by so doing, he prevents yon from committing more crimes, which, in their accumulated enormity, might even transcend the mercy and forgiveness of heaven,\" said Captain Heron. This might be very good philosophy, bnt it did not please Jonathan WUd. \" Don't \u2014 don't hang me, I mean ! \u2014 don't hang me!\" Had he been deceived by his imagination, and was nothing, after all, then, amiss ? Ah, no ! A complete revulsion of feeling took place sud denly in his mind, for he heard a voice he knew too weU, hastily utter a few words in hoarse, angry ton's. \" WeU, my lady, bave yon made np yonr mind?\" Tbe tones were those of the merciless Jonathan \" There !\" Wild. WUd uttered one painful yeU. Heron had rapidly constructed a sUp knot in the sash line that he had cnt down, and pulled it round the neck of Wild. Opening the window then, he. by an exertion of his great strength, that made him handle WUd as if he had been no heavier than a chUd, flung him right ont at the window. Tne reply was in the faint accents of old Lady Castleneau. \" Yes, I have made up my mind.\" \" WeU ?\" \" It was made np!\" \" Confound it, then, have yon kept me here, waiting for nothing ?\" angri y exclaimed Jona than Wild. The cord tightened. Jonathan WUd tried to give utterance to another screaming cry, but the sound was choked in its passage. \"Help! Murder!\" \" Oh, that's it, is it? Then the best way wUl be to put an end to the scene at once, for it has already lasted too long !\" \" Much too long, by lasting even one minute!\" cried Felix Heron, as he strode into the room, and forcibly caught Jonathan WUd by the back of the neck. Heron did not look ont of the window, bnt he closed it carefully, and turning ronnd to Lady Castleneau, he said, in a tone of calmness that was in terrible contrast to the yells of WUd, \" I am afraid, dear iwnt, that yon run the chance of taking cold from the open window, bnt I dosed it as soon as I possibly could.\" \" Oh, FeUx !\" Heron smiled. Heron held Jonathan as thongh he had him in a vice. Lady Castlenean uttered a shout of pleasure, and then sobbed alond. WUd was petrified by fear and surprise, and let his legs slip from under him, so that he was only held up by the powerful grasp of Captain FeUx Eeon. \"Lady Castlenean\u2014 dear aunt!\" said Heron \u2014 \" tell me, has this wretch offered to you the least violence ; for, if he has, I wUl strangle him as he writhes here in my grasp 1\" \" No\u2014 that is, yes.\" \"Which am I to take as my answer?\" cried Captain Heron. \" Do you know, dear aunt, I never felt so tho roughly satisfied with any aot of my life, except one, as with this.\" \" And what one was tbat, FeUx ?\" \" The one that united me to my dear good Edith.\" Lady Castleneau held out her hand to Heron, and pressed his fendly. \" Heaven bless, ever and ever, FeUx, both yon and her I\" \" I wiU cry amen to that prayer, aunt, although one half of it concerns myseU. But now tell me what did that ruffian, Jonathan WUd, want here ?\" 11 He wanted to make some terms with me, in whioh he mentioned the snm of ten thousand pounds, for what he caUed the life of our dear Edith.\" \" He has threatened me, and he did force a gag made of cork into my mouth.\" \" Then he actuaUy touched you?\" \" He did.\" Captain Heron dragged Jonathan WUd to one of the windows. \" Help ! \u2014 janissaries ! \u2014 bull-dogs !\" WUd was only just able to gasp out those words ; but neither janissaries nor buU-dogs were at hand. \" And you refused ?\" \" With scorn!\" \" What did he say then ?\" \" He began to threaten me, when yon so oppor- It appeared as if at last the fate which he had"], [404, "398 EDITH HERON. tnn\u00ably appeared ; and how he got into this room, and ho <v you oame to be in the honse, baffles all my conjectures.\" Heron then briefly told Lady Castleneau all that had taken place ; but as he did so he could not help seeing that she cast many an anxious glance at the casement, on the outside of whioh Jonathan WUd was hanging. He lay stunned by the fall, and half choked by the incomplete hangiug, for some ten iniuues, and then he scrambled to his feet and fled. The in ttinot of self-preservation was now the only cue tbat guided Him, and he ran across the old garden of Castleneau Honse Uke a bunted and wound. -i deer. He scaled the wall at a part where, at any other time, and under circumstances of less excitement, he would bave decided it was not possible to climb it; bnt be rolled over in some odd way wit.oot a panse. \"I see, aunt,\" said Heron, \"that that vUlaindis turbs you still\" \"He does, indeed, Felix.\" \" Then I will cut the rope, and let him drop into the garden, after whioh I will go and throw bis dead body over the wall into the fields, and those may discover him and afford him burial who please.\" \" Do so, do so; it is trouble to bave snch a man near one in life, and horrible to think that in death be is so close at hand,\" exclaimed Lady Castle nean. He fell into a ditch that was on the otber side. He scrambled ont of it, and again he got on his feet and fled. But he was rapidly recovering from his late fright The mental constitution of WUd was not favourable to any very long-oontinueo impres ions of suoh a charaoter as those that had no n pos: es sion of him, and the sight of a hackney coach at the corner of Great Kissell Street was to him like the welcome ory oi \" Land !\" to long eufforers at sea. Captain Heron, with a feeling on his mind that he was about to encounter a disagreeable sight, walked to the window aud opened it The cord hung down the side of the honse, but Jonathan WUd was not at the end of it Heron uttered an exclamation of surprise, and looked down. The coach was moving off. \" Halt !\u2014 hold !\" shouted Wild. \" Open the door !\" The distance to the terrace of the garden that ran along the back of the honse was about eighteen feet, and the faU must have been rather a serious one, bnt not the sUgh test trace of WUd was to be seen. Bnt the appearance of Jonathan was not en gaging. The ditch tbat he had robed in had lite rally bedaubed his clothes with thick, nnctuous black mud, and the eje oilman shook his head and kept his seat. There hung the rope ; old and rotten as it was, it had e . 1 iently broken, and the villanous thief taker had onoe more escaped his fate, and the particular sort cf violent death he so richly de served. \" Open the door, idiot !\" roared Wild \u2014 \" open the door !\" \" Who are you, so free with yonr hard names, I should Uke to know ?\" \" Aunt,\" said Heron, \" Jonathan WUd has es caped 1\" \" Escaped ? \" \" Yes, the cord was rotten and has broken. He is gone, and pnrsnit would now be worse than useless.\" \"Jonathan WUd!\" At the mention of the dreaded name the coach man roUed off his box, and opened the coach door. \" Newgate !\" said Wild, as he sprang into the vehicle, amid a cloud of mud splashes whioh dashed from his clothes. Lady Oastleneau's countenance changed to more contentment at the intelligence. \" I am glad of it, in one sense, Felix,\" she said ; '\u2022' for let that man deserve death, as in truth he does, in any way that he oan be made to meet it, I wonld rather any one was his executioner than yon.\" \" It is fate,\" said Heron. \" Jonathan is re served for some death which it is not in my power to infliot npon him ; and now, auut, I wUl leave yon, and wait for you below.\" \" Yes, sir, eaid the coachman, \" if yon please, sir, Newgate I think yon said, sir ?\" \" Yes, but stop at the first public-house, and get me a pint of brandy.\" \" Yes, sir.\" The next public-house in that neighbourhood was near at hand, and the brandy was duly brought out to Wild, who certainly did not drink it all, but it is uo exaggeration to say that half of it went down his throat at onoe. \" Newgate !\" he oried again, as he slung the last of the brandy in the frightened coachman's face CHAPTER CLXXI. \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" The coach proceeded, and on the way, it is not too much to say that Jonathan Wild expended the whole possible vocabulary of oa'hs, curses, and imprecations on the heads of Lady Castleneau and Felix Heron JONATHAN WILD ALARM8 EDITH, AND ATTEMPTS THE CAPTURE OF FELIX HERON. Exactly as Heron had surmised, so had Wild escaped tbe doom that seemed at one moment to be accomplished. The rope broke by the sudden jerk that was given to it Dy his being cast out of the window. Tbe gloomy gaol of Newgate was soon reached, for the coacoman was not at aU desirous of keep ing such a fare a minute longer than was neces sary. Had Felix Heron let him out carefully he would undoubtedly have been hanged. As it was, it was upon that occasion that Wild contracted the wry-necked appearance that went with him to the grave. The rope gave him a terrible twist, and then it sndlegiy parted, and down he feU on to the stone bilcony. Wild sprung out \" How much?\" \" Nothin* to von, Mr. WUd.\" \" Very good.\" The central gate of the metropoUtan prison was opened, and Jonathan disappeared from the gaze of two or three chance passengers, who stopped in the Old Bailey, to see who it was, on a"], [405, "399 KOITH nERON, Sunday morning before ohuroh time, that arrived at the gaol. Then WUd held a conference with the Governor, at the end of which he was accommodated with a lantern and a key, which would enable him to pay a visit to Edith, for that was his inten tion.

Edith was stUl alone, for the yonng Eavl of Bridgewater had not had time to arm bis wife with the necessary order to sea her, so that Lady Bridgewater had not arrived. Wild slung optn the cell door, aud placing the lantern on the floor at his feet, be crossed his arms npon his breist, aud burst out into a brutal laugh. Edith wai gieatly alarmed at this new phtiBe in the manner in which Jonathan WUd greeted her. It was a voice iu the vaulted and low passage outside the cell door, tha; called upon Jonathan Wild. \"What is it?\" \"Mr. Wild!\" Ue habiily left Edith's cell, and shut the door, carefully clo>iug the lock, and turning the key in it The Governor of Newgate was in the vaulted passage. Ske did not speak. Wild laughed again ; and then he had to hold his hands to bis throat, as though the action of laughing bad brought on an accession <f the pains of that strangulation again, from whioh he had suffered so much lately. Then be spoke. \"Edith Tarleton, or Heron \u2014 call yourself what yon will \u2014 the time has come when I must be ex pUcit with yon.\" Still Edith did not speak. \" You may hold your peace,\" added WUd, \" as long as yon like \u2014 that don't matter to me.

Good day, Mr. Governor ; I advise yon to look well to your prisoner.\" Jonathan Wild abruptly left Newgate, and as he did so he pressed his hinds npon his head, \u00bbnd looked like an owl at the bright midday sun which was glowing and gleaming on the old stone walls of Newgate. He had had but little sleep of late, and the want of it began to tell even upon his iron con stitution\" \"But I say yes I\" \" What is it ?\" said another gentleman, coming from the room. Wild knew him. It was the Earl of Bridgewater. The first gen tleman was Colonel Trelawney, of the Guards, but Wild had forgotten him. At sight of the Earl of Bridgewater, Wild was a little staggered, but he quickly recovered his composure, and, with an air of quickness and de cision, he said, \" I am here on duty as an officer of the polic., and nothing shall make me swerve from that duly!\" \" No one wishes you,\" said the Earl ; \" but I suppose that you own to some sort of authority over you ? \" \" None, my lord, but that of a magistrate or a judge.\" \" Behold both, then !\" \" Not yet I\" he muttered. \" Not yet\u2014 no, not yet ! I will hang her, and then I shall be able to taste repose. That shall be the return I will make to Felix Heron for his little attention to me at Castleneau House this morning.\" The Earl opened wide the door of the break fast-room, and, to the astonishment of both Wild and his men, they saw, sittiog quietly with old Lady Castleneau, Sir John Fielding, the magis trate, and Baron Finch, one of the then Bsrons of tbn Excheqner. \" What do you want, Mr. WUd ?\" said Sir John Fielding. \"Want?\u2014 want?\" Wild went round the corner of the Old Bailey to his own honse as quickly as he could. He summoned a oouple of his most trusty ja nissaries, and ordered them to recruit among tbe constables of the district for half a dozen able bodied men to accompany him on an enterprise of danger and profit The sum he named was ten guineas each, if successful. \" Yes ; whom do you seek here ?\" \" The notorious highwayman, Captaia Felix Heron, of Epping Forest !\" \" He is not here, Mr. Wild, you may take my word for tbat\" It was Wild's intention to make an assault npon Castleneau House for the capture of Felix Heron. \" And mine,\" said the judge- Wild had nothing to do for it bnt to bow him self out, which he did with the utmost grace in the world. It was by quite an intricate and involved train of reasoning that Wild came to the con clusion Felix Heron was yet to be found at Cas tleneau House. \" Game's up,\" he said to his men ; \" bnt it is not aU lost. Another time, and the same hunt wUl find the hare.\" Any ordinary person would suppose that as he, Jonathan, knew of the presence of Heron there, it was the place of all others that the latter would immediately quit ; but then, again, as that was the natural supposition, it would be a piece of great finesse on the part of Heron to stay there, on the principle of the man who escaped from New gate, and took lodgings in the Old Bailey, as biing the most unlikely place in all London where the officers wonld look for him. He made a sign to his two men to follow him, and dismissed the others with a crown to drink. \" You two,\" he said, when he had his men alone with him, \u2014 \"you two get yourselves well mounted, and meet at the ' Three Tuns Tavern,' in Aldersgate, this night at twelve o'olocr.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" Take care you don't fail. It will be a five guinea job to eaoh of yon. I will \u2014 I must try to get some sleep, or I shall go ont of my mind.\" So Wild determined on attacking Castlenean Honse. The volunteer constables were soon enough found, and by half-past twelve o'clock Jonathan WUd, with a party of no less than twelve men at bis heels, hammered away at the old doors of Lady Oastleneau's mansion. Several of his force he sent ronnd into the fields to keep watch, in case Felix Heron should try to make his escape in that direction ; and as the great iron gates were unlocked, he, Wild, con sidered that he had quite stolen a march on the inhabitants of the house by reaching the haU door. CHAPTER OLXXII. JONATHAN WILD AND HIS MEN UNCONSCIOCSL1 AID AND ASSIST EDITH. Now it so happened that the 8heriff was a con scientious and hnmane man, and he was disturbed at the non-reception of the pardon of Edith, which he thought he ought to receive in consequence of the absence of the sUp of the Recorder's report containing her name. As the day wore on, that anxiety on his part became all the greater, particularly as, by ques tioning the courier, he found that he had been stopped on the road. The Sheriff then had his misgivings of the whole transaction, and was greatly afraid that the actual and real pardon of Edith Heron had been abstiacted from tbe ciurier's packet Old Anthony opened it at once. \" Seize that old rascal and handcuff him,\" said Wild. \"On what charge?\" aik.d a tall and gentle manly-looking man, suddenly confronting Wild lrom the breakfast-room. \" Because I choose.\" \"That is not sufficient.\" \"Alter it, then, if you can Might, you wUl"], [407, "EDITH HERON. 401 J It so happened that the Recorder, immediately on coming to London, had been summoned to the bed-side of a near relation, who was about to bid the world good night ; so that the Sheriff had no opportunity of consulting with him in regard to what had taken place in his interview with the King. spread at Windsor Castle on the subject, Captain Heron had the fate of bis Edith in his hands- He fully intended to append tbe royal signature, with the necessary words of pardon, to the slip of parchment he had taken from the courier, and produce the same the moment the procession to Tyburn should start from Newgate on the Mon- day morning. Heron had several reasons for the adoption of this course. The principal one was that Edith would be free of the prison, and in the open air, so that her im- mediate release, by order of the Sheriff, to whom he would have to present the supposed pardon, would be untrammelled by any formalities of the gaol. Such, then, was the state of affairs m regard to Edith on that Sunday evening preceding the Monday on which Jonathan WUd, with all his vindictive passions aroused by what had hap- Acting, then, as he thought, for the best, the Sheriff, at about six o'clock on that Sunday evenings determined to send a special conrier to Windsor Castle with a note to the ComptroUer of the Royal Household on the subject This, so far as the safety of Edith was concerned, happened to be the very worst, and was the most perilous, step the Sheriff could take.

That was soon expressed \" Send a special courier to tbe Sheriff to say No, have it written. You write it, my lord, on our authority. Write that the royal olemency \" \" Yes. your Majesty '\" The lord in waiting liked to hear the word cle mency. It seemed so very promising. \" Write to say that the royal clemency will not be exorcised in the case of Edith Heron !\" The King waved his hand, and the lord in waiting had no resource but to leave the room. In half an hour a monn'ed royal messenger left one of the o urt-yards in Windsor Castle for London.

Lbtle did Captain Heron, or bis friend the Earl of Bridgewater. imagine what was taking plsce on the road from London to Windsor. What that was we shall briefly now relate to the reader. The Sheriff expected tbe return of the special messenger he bad sent, about the hour of eleven. Jonathan Wi'd, not knowing by what means the slip from the Recorder's report had been ab stracted, was under tbe impression that if a courier did come from Windsor at all that night, it would be a confirmation of the pardon of Edith. He resolved, therefore, at once to put a stop to such a probability of defeat. He wonld stop tbe courier Could anything bo better for Edith ? We shall see. It was a quarter past eight o'clock when the Sheriff's special messenger reached the royal resi dence. The man did not put himself at all ont of the way to hnrry to London. No directions had been given him to make speed. An audience < f tbe Comptroller cf the House hold was procured ; and, as the Sheriff of London was an ofli ial personage, his despatch was at once forwarded to the private api. tments of the King. It was opened, although not by the King him self ; but tbe contents . trnck tho nobleman in waiting, wh. was iu authority sufficient to open snch a letter, as rather of a merciful tendency. It was an inquiry whether tbe retention of the slip, with the name of Edith Heron upon it. be longing to the Recorder's report, was for tbe pur pose of pardon ? The lord in waiting knew nothiag whatever abont tbe matter ; bnt aa the retention of the sUp was stated as a fact, he thought the person named was in no danger. The King was trying to play a game of chess, and failing egregiously, so that he was not in the best of humours when the despatch from the Sheriff was brought nnder his notice. \" What is it\u2014 eh ?\" The personal impression of tbe conrier on the subject was that the despatch he bore addressed to the Sheriff of London was in truth and fact a pardon for some condemned person ; and he was the more particularly indnoed to think that, by its being Sunday night If that were the oase, why shonld he in any way hurry himself abont the matter ? The person would not be hanged in the morn ing ; and as for tbe fact of a few hours' more er less tortnre of mind in one of the condemned cells of Newgate, the conrier did not think that worth his consideration. He took the matter, therefore, quite easy. On the outskirts of Windsor he oalled at an inn that was kept by a consin of his, and had a drop of purl at the door. He did not dismount That would have been contrary to one of the express conditions of his dsty ; but he sat on his horse, and chatted for a good ten minates at the door of the inn. It was eleven o'clook before he was fairly five miles on his road to London. \"From the Sheriff of London, your Majesty; with an irquiry about one of the prisoners left for execution to-morrow morning.\" \" Who is it\u2014 eh ?\" \"Edith Heron.\" Then, in some strange manner, a creeping kind of fear came over the courier. An angry spot was on the face of the King, and he nearly upset all the chessmen. \" I will hear no more about her. It is a pre sumption. Let the law take its course We wUl hear no more.\" There was a gloomy bit of road, bounded on each side by tall trees, and sweeping down into a hoUow, which in the winter time was always damp and swampy, and whioh he was rapidly ap proaching, as the hour of midnight drew near that he began to dread. He did not know why he dreaded that bit of road. * Bnt the Sheriff is in a difficulty.\" \" Ah ! The hangman dead ?\" \" No, yonr Majesty.\" \" Because, if that is the case, or if he won't act, it is the Sheriff's duty to see to it.\" \" Yes. your Majesty, but that is not the diffi culty. The Sheriff wants to know, since your Majesty retained tbe slip with the name of Edith Heron npon it, from Mr. Recorder's report, what are yonr Majesty's gracious intentions in regard to her ?\" He had no idea that on that night of aU others there onght to be any cause for fear ; bnt certain it is tbat as he began tbe descent into the hollow, he felt cold to his very heart, and he shook in every limb. But he went on. He tried to persuade himself that it was but some temporary indisposition that assaUed him, or it might be tbe commencement of some more serious illness. At all events, he rallied himself to a great degree out of his fears. He trotted on. Tbe King sprang to bis feet \"Retained it \u2014 retained the slip?\" \"Yes, yonr Majesty.\" \" We did not!\" The lord in waiting bowed. \" We did not do so! There is some trickery here \u2014 some villany ! ft is treason \u2014 it is flagrant contempt of us and our position I We did not re tain the slip, aud meant the prisoner to har g !\" The lowest part of tbe hoUow in the road was reached.

A bat almost struok the conrier in the face with its leathery wings as it took its erratic, headlong flight in the night air. He urged his horse to a quicker pace. The place had au ill-omened aspect, and he was glad to think that a very few moments more wonld suffice to leave it behind him. a random one, but it had taken deadly effect enough. * By accident it had stniok the oourier exactly on the left temple, and so passed into his brain, leaving a little jagged-looking perforation in the skin where it had effected its entry. From that perforation a thin stream of dark coloured blood was issuing. \" Dead !\" said WUd. \"Halt!\" cried a voice. There waa not the least regret or compunction iu the tone in which he spoke. Plunging his hand, then, into the leather valise that the oourier carried, after cutting it open, in preference to taking the trouble to pick the look, he pulled out the letter to the Sheriff. By the light of his lantern Wild read the ad- The conri \u00abr drew bridle impulsively, as any one will stop, either walking or riding, on a sud den demand so to do. But at the same instant his reason returned te him. aud dictated his better course. Ttat was to ride c>. To gallop on, and do his dnty with what speed he might. The oourier dashed his spurs against his horse's flanks and gave it the rein. Tha horse made a plunge forward, and was on tbe point of starting to a gallop, when the sharp report of a pistol rang out in the night air. The courier uttered a half-stifled ory, and swerved to and fro in the saddle. The terrified horse plunged into a deeper hollow in the road, and nearly fell ; and here, before the creature could recover itself sufficiently to. start off, which it had a firm inclination to do, a man darted out from the roadude among the old shadowing trees. dress. \" To the Sheriff of London.\" On the top portion of the despatch was printed the words, \" On his Majesty's .ervioe.\" A sinister smile played upon the hideous coun tenance of Jonathan WUd. \" So,\" he said, \" I hold the life or the death of the fair Countess of Whitcombe in my hands now. What would not Felix Heron give to have this packet in his own good keeping ? Ha, ha ! Ho will never have it\" Wild felt so confident lhat it was the pardon of Edith he held in his hand, that he did not think it worth while to open it to confirm bis ideas. \" No, no !\" he added ; \" this shaU never see the light of to-morrow's dawn.\" As he spoke, he epened the side door of the lantern, and held the corner of the packet inside until it caught in a flame. Then Wild held up the letter, and turned it abont in the air until it had caught all over, and was bnrning brightly with the exception of the corner by which he held it With a demoniac look of satisfaction Jonathan WUd watched the consumption of the despatch, little dreaming that he was destroying a document whioh, had it reached the Sheriff, would have been virtually the death warrant of Edith. The unfortunate courier had fallen over on one side of his saddle, and but for the fact that his foot still kept in the stirrup on the other side, no doubt he would have reached the ground. The man who had darted out from among the trees seemed with a kind of instinct to see what the state of affairs was on the instant, aud he released the foot of the courier from the stirrup. The horse recovered from its half stumble, and bounded forward. The conrier fell heavily on to the damp, heavy roadway. \" 1 think that is tolerably well done,\" said the man, as he took from one of the deep pockets of his coat a smaU dark lantern and opened the sUde. The flame came down close to his fingers. He felt his nails getting hot. The edge of one of them was even a Uttle oharred. The light fell npon the face of Jonathan Wild. It was no other than he who had lain in wait Then WUd tossed ap into the air the last Uttle corner fragment of the despatch, and before it could reach the ground it was completely con sumed. for the conrier, preferring to get through the affair personally, although close at hand he had the two men he had ordered to accompany him on that expedition- Wild paused a moment with his ear close dewn to the road, to listen if in either direction any vehicle or horseman was coming, and then he growled out his satisfaction that all was clear. \"Good I The road all to myself for another ten minutes at the least. I wonder if this fool, who wouldn't stand still when he was told, has lost his life ?\" \" That's done !\" he said, with a self-satisfiei ohuckle. \" Look to yourself, now, Felix Heron, for you are, in twelve hours from now, a solitary man, and she whom yon loved so weU wUl be with the dead.\" CHAPTER CLXXIII WUd held the lantern close down to the cou rier. JONATHAN WILD IS FOILED, AND Si.rH 3TABT9 FOR THE FOREST AGAIN. The man lay upon his face, with one of his arms donbled np under him, and the other pushed round to his back. The Monday morning dawned amid storm and confusion. \"Hillo1\" said WUd, as he dealt the conrier a kick. \" Get np I\" The courier did not move. A gale of wind was sweeping over London, and doing much damage. After about one o'clook on that Sunday night a great ohange for the worse had taken place in the weather, aud np to about eight tbe storm that had sprung up raged with fury. It tnen abated somewhat, but a dashing bravy rain commenced. WUd easily turned him over and looked in his face. One glance waa sufficient The man was dead.

Wild laugbe i. \"No, Smithers, I don't. Ha, ha! I rather think it is called Hanging Monday. Ha, ha 1\" \" That's about it, Mr. Wild!\" \u25a0 Any news in the night ?\" \" No, sir.\" \"Good!\" Jonathan passed along those passages of New gate which connect the prison proper with the house of the Governor; and, without the smallest ceremony, opening every door that came in his way, at length fonnd that functionary finishing his breakfast \"What, Mr. Governor!\" exolaimed WUd; \"are yon so very indiscreet as to eat a hearty meal on Monday morning during the sessions !\" \" Well, Mr. Wild, I generally enjoy my break fast, I may say.\" \" Pho ! pho ! You should reserve yourself for the marrow puddings t bat the Sheriffs and Chap lain enjoy\" The Governor put on a look of comical distress, as he replied, \" That's just it, Wild. The Sheriffs and tbe Ordinary do enjoy the marrow puddings on a Hanging Monday so much, that there is not much left for anybody else.\" \" Ha, ha !\" laughed Wild. What awful laughs they were that Jonathan in dulged in on that morning ! They were enough to freeze anybody's blood to listen to them. Even the Governor of Newgate shuddered. And he was used to them. \" Come, Mr. Governor,\" then added Wild, \" what sort of sport is it to be ? Who is reprieved ? \" \" No one.\" What varied emotions the dawn of that Monday must have produced in the minds of the inmates of that huge receptacle of stone and life ? What was Edith thinking of then ? Shall we say ? Ah, yes ; her thoughts were in the deep and beautiful shadows of Epping Forest I Her heart was there with that Uttle one who formed the new and exquisite tie that bound her to the world in which she had lived and suffered so mnch. Not that her love for Felix Heron was in any degree changed or affeoted by that new affection ; but it was a new one, and if nature exacted from her on behalf of that little child her last thoughts at night, and the first in the morning that greeted her waking existence, he, Felix, need not be jealous of the aU-absorbing mother's love. There was no fear at the heart of Edith. She had no apprehension of what might happen on that Monday morning. She had faith. Faith in Felix Heron. He would save her. She was quite sure he would. How exactly the matter wonld be brought abont was not much moment, so that it was accomplished ; and Edith had taught herself to look upon the dawn of that expected Monday as the dawn of her freedom. The Countess of Bridgewater, who had staid with her as long as by any stretch of laxity the rules of Newgate would admit on the Sunday, had told her she would certainly be rescued. Edith had received the news withont emotion, because it was only a sort of confirmation of her own foregone conclusions. That was all. \"What?\" \"No one, Mr. Wild. Did you expect any one would be?\" \" Yea Edith Heron.\" The Governor shook his head. \" Nothing has come here, Mr. Wild, 10 that job will be done. And I can't help thinking it's a pity, for she's a true lady\u2014 though, by the by, Bet of Southwark, who was hanged last sessions abont that affair of the silver candlesticks, would have made two of her. Oh, she was a fine woman I\" \" She was,\" said Wild. \" And it was found out after all that FUching Jenny was the wench who was really guUty, and Bet had nothing to do with the affair.\" * \" Yes, that was about it, Mr. Wild. And Mr. Recorder was in no end of a way about it ; but as I eaid, accidents wUl happen, and Bet no donbt would, at some time or other, have stolen som. candlestioks, so it was as broad as it was long; though, being such a fine woman as she was, I thought it a pity she should swing.\" The door of the room was at this moment flung open, and a turnkey, in a loud voioe, announced\u2014 \" The Sheriff 1\" The Sheriff is the King of Newgate. He is received with almost regal honours within the waUs, and every one of the officials is ready to bow down before him. He is the only man who, if he chose to do such a thing, could open the gate and let any prisoner walk out \u2014 taking, of couise, on himself the consequences of the act. Tbe Sheriff on this occasion had a troubled look upon his face. No answer had come from Windsor abont Ediih Heron. The young wife of the Earl of Bridgewater was much more full of fears than Edith. And so that Monday morning came, and by nine o'clook Jonathan Wild walked from his own house down the Old Bailey, looking anything but in good condition, bnt with such a glance of hateful satis faction in his eyes, that people who, by chance, were coming up the Old Bailey on that side of the way, crossed over to the other. It was something to get out of the way of Jonathan WUd. A demoniac laugh came from his lips, as WUd saw the second person do this, and he paused to look after him. \" Better,\" he growled, \" be hated and feared than despised Ha, ha!\" He reached the steps of Newgate, and at sight of him tbe man on the lock eagerly opened the wicket \" Good morning, Mr. Wild I\" \" Bah ! yon don't caU this a good morning, do yon?\" WUd was half wet through in ooming the short distance from his own house in Newgate Street to the prison. \" Well, no, Mr. WUd, I can't say it is a nice morning.\" \" Then don't lay it Open this door, you Smithers !\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Is the Governor np?\" \" Oh, yet, Mr. Wild, ever so long ago. You surely don't forget sir, what this day is, do vou, Mr. WUd?\" J . J . He hardly knew what to do. \" Mr. Governor,\" he said, \" have you anything for me in the way of a letter or despatch ?\" \" No, your worship.\""], [411, "405 EDITH HERON. \" It is very odd.\" Wild slowly slunk out of the room, and stood outside the door, with an awful leer upon his face. But against some plot, some plan of which he had no hint or conception, he felt how harmless he was. But he trusted to luck\u2014 to that good fortune that had hitherto stood him in such good stead ; and so, abruptly terminating his convers Governor of Newgate, he set abou tions. \" Where is Mr. Wifd?\" added the Sheriff. \"I thought I saw him just now.\" \" Here, your worship,\" said Wild, stepping a pace into the room again. \" Oh, weU, Mr. Wild, you will take the condnot of the procession to Tyburn to-day.\" \" Yes, yonr worship !\" \" Start at\u2014 at \" There was one thing that he conld not prevaU npon himself to omit doing, although he began rather to dread it. That was to see Edith. \" Eleven, sir?\" \" No, twelve\u2014 another hour may produce some thing,\" added the Sheriff to himself, as he walked to the window, and looked ont npon the rain. The rain that was faUing with a steady perse verance upon his state coach, which was at the door, and upon the gold-bedizened coaohman and two footmen, who were all scarcely protected from the shower even by their overcoats. WUd looked significantly at the Governor, and the latter looked np then at the ceiling, for he was in front of the Sheriff. He wanted to assure himself on that morning that there she still was in the cell at Newgate waiting for death. And yet he, even he \u2014 even Jonathan Wild \u2014 shrunk from the look of those eyes, the light of whioh, according to aU probability and calcula tion, would be so soon quenched in eternity. He spoke to the head turn Key. \" Are you snre aU is right and safe?\" \"As how, Mr. WUd?\" \u00ab With EJith Heron ?\" \" Oh, bless yon, yes !\" \" She is still in the cell ?\" \" Well, Mr. Governor,\" said the Sheriff, \" I will join the procession at the foot of Holborn Hill, at a quarter past twelve.\" \" Yes, your worship!\" Tbe Sheiiff left the prison, and Jonathan Wild made a great pretence of foUowing him quite bareheaded into the rain. \" Of course, Mr. Wild.\" \" Because, you know, she has had a lady visitor, abont her own height and age, you understand.\" \" Oh, Mr. Wild, don't frighten a fellow ! She hasn't given us the slip. If yon know her weU by sight, come aud have a good look at her for yourself, and make sure that aU is right\" \" I will.\" Jonathan wore an old scratch wig, for he had no hair at aU on his head ; and either to appal any one who might be passing with his ugliness, or to pretend to show great respect for the Sheriff, or to keep it dry, he took off his wig, and let the rain beat down on his head. Wild accompanied the turnkey to Edith's cell. There she was, calm and placid. She did not speak to WUd, but as he regarded her with fixed looks, she felt as if an evil eye was upon ber. The turnkey guessed that Jonathan had some thing to say to the prisoner, and he leit him alone to say it \" Edi'h !\" \u00bb To Mr. Recorder 1\" said the Sheriff, as he got into his carriage. \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Wild to himself, as he stepped into the vestibule of Newgate; \"ha, ha! he is uneasy, and is looking ont for a pardon for Edith, the Countess, but he will look in vain, although, if he chose to go to the Windsor road, he might possibly find the ashes of it in the mnd. The modern custom is to get rid of any crimi nals, who are to die for their country's good, at as early an hour in the morning as possible. It was different in old times. The procession from Newgate was in the habit of starting for Tyburn about eleven o'clock, or something before. There was an old idea that the execution must take place before twelve on the day appointed, or it would be illegal, but it was very seldom that the poor wretches who were to suffer reaUy bade adieu to the world till one. Jonathan WUd, however, was nervously anxious to get the matter over as soon as possible, for he had a great respect both for tho courage and the finesse of Captain Heron. That something wonld be attempted to save Edith he felt certain. What that something, however, wonld be \u2014 what piecise steps it would take\u2014 he had no pos sible idea. He only hoped that mere physical force would be the means attempted- He hoped that Captain Heron would bring all his men from Epping Forest and that there wonld be a fight in the open public streets. That wonld have pleased WUd, because he thought it impossible that Heron shonld be suc cessful in anything so audacious and so hazardoni. She made no answer. \"Edith Heron!\" Still she did not speak. \" You fancy that by this silence you show your contempt of death and scorn of me, but yon are mistaken. I come to yon for the last time.\" StiU Edith spoke not. \" WeU,\" added WUd, \" I in some sort admire your firmness, which I havs no desire to call ob stinacy, so I wUl say what I came to say. WiU you live ?\" \" Yes,\" replied Edith. \" Ob, you think better of it Oome, put your name to this paper.\" Edith made a gesture of loathing and con tempt. \" I shall live,\" she said, \" but not by yonr good will or by any act in whioh yon are concerned.\" \" So, so, that is it ! Some nice little plot to set yon at liberty ! Ha, ha ! We shall see \u2014 we shall see ! Yon might save your own life, and that of your husband and of your chUd ; for I teU you, as snre as my name is Jonathan WUd, you will all perish if I wish it 1\" Edith looked at the side wall of the cell instead of at Jonathan WUd; and, with burning hate in his looks, he was about to cross the threshold of the ceU \u2014 perhaps to strike her \u2014 when a hand was laid upon his arm. A quiet mUd voice, said olose to his ear, \" Pray what is aU this about?\" Wild shrank back. It was the reverend Ordinary of Newgate who spoke, and who thought it his duty, as in good and"], [412, "406 EDITH HERON. honest truth it was, to visit the colls of the con demned prisoners as early as possible on that day of death. \" What Mr. WUd, is all this?\" \"Nothing, sir. But the fact is, ths prisoner knows where a great quantity of stolen property Uei cmcealed, whioh I am anxious shonld be restored to the owners ; and I was only urging her, now that she is so soon abont to bid the world good night, to make a dear breast of it, and teU me all abont it \" the belfry of which, in its turn, would oome the dismal tolling. The Church of St GUes in the Fields wonld be the next and the last. Such was the mode of procedure which was called ringing the condemned souls ont of Hol born. Ding-dong \u2014 ding-dong ! The sound was a mournful one ; and Edith, as she heard it could not but feel that the reverbera tion of the air with those melancholy strokes touched her heart \"Well, weU, we shaU see I\" WUd slnnk away, and the reverend Ordinary began to speak to Edith. She stopped him mildly and firmly in his ex hortations. \" Sir, what Jonathan WUd has just told yon Is false; and as regards your kind exhortations, pray lose no time in bestowing them npon those poor creatures who this morning wiU die, for I \u25a0ball be saved.\" And yet she had no positive fear of death. What then, must be the impression of that death bell on the minds of those who had no hope of resoue I Dreadful! There was now a sound of footsteps in the pas sage by the side of the condemned cells. \" Edith Heron 1\" cried a voice. Edith felt \u00abs if she ought to cry ont, \"Here!\" but she did not speak. Then the cell door was opened, and the Go vernor of Newgate appeared, accompanied by one of the Under Sheriffs. \" Are you so sure of that ?\" \" I am, sir.\" \" By what means ?\" \" My husband has sent me ft message to that effeot and I believe him.\" \"Have yon such faith in him whUe yon are still a condemned prisoner in a condemned ceU of Newgate ?\" \" Even so.\" In a common- place, every-day sort of tone, as though it were a ceremony too common to be taken any pains npon, the Governor placed his hand lightly on the shoulder of Edith and (poke : \" Mr. Under Sheriff, I deliver to yon tbe body of Edith Heron.\" The Chaplain bowed. There was a something so grand, and noble, and confiding in the manner of Edith, that he could not but respect it \" May aU your hopes be fulfilled 1\" he said. \" It is my earnest prayer ; but if they shonld not I wiU be near yon.\" He left the ceU, and Edith was alone. The stillness around her was oppressive, and a sharp pang shot through her heart as she thought of the possible danger to which Felix Heron might be exposed on that morning in his endeavour to save her. Tbe Under Sheiiff slightly inclined his head, and Edith felt that bnt for the promised aid from her husband she was delivered over to death. She was conducted then to the prison yard. A crowd of prison officials, and two or three of the aldermen of the City, were present to look at the prisoners. The tolling of the beU was much more distinct, and then a man with a foxy-looking aspect and a slouching gait strolled into the yard. Around his waist he had a coil of rope wound many times abont him. That was the hangman. \" Ready ?\" asked the Under Sheriff. \" All ready, sir,\" said the Governor. A cart rumbled into the yard ; and Edith hardly knew what was taking place, so deeply interested was she in the fate of her fellow prisoners, until the cart was driven ont into the Old BaUey by a ronte close to where the courts now sit She had hitherto always thonght that it would be a happy thing, if anything fatal were to happen to him, if she too, at the same moment, could pass from life to death. Hand in hand with him, she thonght the passage to eternity wonld have no terrors. Bnt now the case was different What was to become of that Uttle one who was in the deep forest at Epping, waiting for all that love and tenderness whioh, for many a long year to come, must make np the sum and very essence of its existence. Then arose a shont and a groan from the crowd of people collected about the prison gates. There was then a trampling of horses' feet and from the inn-yard over tbe way out dashed the mounted escort of officers who were to accompany the procession to Tyburn. Jonathan Wild, on a powerful dark day horse, was at the head of this escort. This was the thonght that gave to the reflection of poor Edith a complexion of sorrow that wonld not otherwise have been. She wept long and bitterly. At the sight of him, the shouts, hisses, and groans, of the mob were something terrible to hear. But WUd was used to all that. CHAPTER OLXXIV. Every Monday morning, dm ing the period of tbe sessions, he war on the same duty which now fell to his share on this more interesting occasion, and he was always so greeted by the mob. It was WUd's practice, on ordinary occasions, to pretend that he took aU that noisy notice ef him in a complimentary way, and he would rouse the anger of the mob often to fearful fury by smUiug and sUghtly raising his hat and placing one hand on that part of his breast where the heart is sap posed to be situated. But now WUd was too much interested in what was going on to attempt any suoh mummery. EDITH HAS AGAIN THE BRIGHT GREEK OF THS WOODLAND VERDURE IN HER EYES. It is eleven o'olock. The great bell of Newgate began to toU. Its object is to toll out the condemned prisoners to Tyburn. Until they got past St Sepulchre's Church, the beU of Newgate would give forth those dismal death sounds. Then St. Sepulchre's wonld take np the tones until the Church of St Andrew was reached, from"], [413, "EDITH HERON. 407 \" Right aboutl\" he cried to his men. \" Keep the mob off!\" perhaps not a little \u2014 superstitious. He won just the sort of man to shrink from a c_urchyar_ at night, while probably out of bravado he would dash into a family vault But that would be me \u25a0 e bravado. At the same time his heart would be f uU of fears. He backed his own horse so suddenly then that some of the foremost of the cro wd got their toes smashed, aud for a few moments there was quite a scene of confusion. Tbe mob, however, had no idea of getting into a collision with the officers, who they knew were quite brutal enough to be glad of an opportuni'y of using their hangers if they could. But now it is nearly half-past eleven. The procession to Tybnrn is late in starti g, but it is all formed, and just as the chimes of the half-hoar sounded from St Sepulchre's Chnrch the proces sion leaves the Old BaUey. WUd trots down Snow HUl a Uttle iu advance. Bnt now at mid-day \u2014 beneath the light of the open sky, in the streets of London \u2014 to see an ap parition, the apparition of the man whom be had shot \u2014 murdered on the real from Windsor the preceding night \u2014 was too horrible. Jonathan Wild uttered a yell of fear. The courier resumed a mask of grey-coloured velvet which he had iu his hand, and which, to the great surprise and curiosity of the people about be had worn from the moment \u2014 only abont half a minute before \u2014 he had emerged from Field Lane. What does he see that makes him pause and look anxiously right down to the foot of the bill? A few people, and only a few, saw the terrible face along with Wild. General attention was so much at that moment dirteted to the processsion coming down Snow Hill, that it was very improbable au y one saw the death-looking face vihUeit was exhibited tc WUd. One woman did. Surely be knows that the Sheriff in his carriage wonld be thereabout waiting to take its place, but that is not what attracts his attention. It is a solitary horseman. A man in a faded scarlet coat A hat with the black cockade in it that denoted the King's service \u2014 it did then only belong to that service. A courier's belt and despatch valise was about this man, and the puzzle of Jonathan WUd was complete to see that he rode a very sorry- looking horse tbat looked jaded and not fit for a mUe's trot on ihe best road in London. It was close to the entrance to Field Lace that this mau stood like a statue on his horse, and Jonathan WUd was exceedingly anxious not only to know his errand but to get one good, fair look in his face. She fainted at once. A man did. He ran away down Shoe Lane as hard as his feet would carry him The stoppage that Jonathan WUd made brought all the procession, so to speak, down upon him, and he was soon in the midst of the mounted escort instead of lead ng it \" What's the matter, Mr. WUd ? * asked one. \" Gracioos heaven !\" It was so teldom that Wild spoke tuuh words, that the constables were quite amazed to hear them. It was difficult to do so, for at the moment the Sheriffs coach came from tbe diiection of Smith field, and then WUd saw tbat the coach he had already seen and mistaken for the Sheriff's coach was some other vehicle of about equal pretensions to ornament The next word he uttered, though, was one that came much more commonly from his lifS. \" Brandy !\u2014 I am ill\u2014 faint!\" He reeled on bis horse. Two of the escort held him np, and the cart with ihe condemned passed him. The Ordinary of Newgate, who was in the cart giving spiritual consolation to those who were to die, looked asto nished at Wild, and Edith felt her colour come and go, for something seemed to tell her lhat this was tbe first act in the drama of her release. It is the fashion \u2014 a mere affectation \u2014 to decry the ornaments and the gilding of the Btate coach, say, of the Sheiiff or the Lord Mayor; but if people wou'd only tell the truth, and get rid of ihe affectation of a pretended love of plainness, they would own that they admired show aud graudeur very much, aud deeply envied it Why not? Wild increased his pace He reached the foot of the hUl just at the mo ment that the Sheriff's coach came opposite to the courier iu the faded scarlet coat Then Wild taw bis face. He started, and gave snch a tug to the bri ile of his horse, that the creature was nearly thrown back, and held its fore feet in the air in a v.ry picturesque way for a few seconds. Jouathan Wild turned as pale ab death. A look of inconceivable horror crept over his face. It was so. The courier, or the apparition of that murdered personage, waited now, with the grey mask on his face, until the Sheriff's coach reached him. Then, with a sudden movemeut, ue opened the leather despatch-cose he carried, > ud look oat a folded paper. The Sheriff leant half oat of his coach, in hi_ eagerness to take it. * Ah I\" he said, \" Mr. Simpson,\" to a gentleman who was in the coach with him, \" this is a release for Ediih Heron. Look at it It is the Recorder's sUp. too.\" His Ups retracted. His eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets. It was the look of the courier that produced aU these effects upon the iron senses of Jonathan Wild. Tbe face was deadly pale \u2014 white as wax, and with very much that look and tiut about it. Exactly at the corner of the temple was a jagged looking scarlet spot The oonrier raised his finger, and pointed to that spot at the same time that the white, cold, dead-looking lips parted in a ghastly smUe. We know that Jonathan WUd was a UtUe \u2014 The courier bent down and spoke to tbe Sheriff * 1 am desired, Mr. Sheriff, to say that imme diate t fleet is to be given to the document I have presented to yon.\" \" Certainly, my good friend ; I am only too glad to do eo. Bnt why is it that you wear a mi_?k ?\" \" WiU you permit me to do so, sir, without a reason, because \" \"B_c_J\u00abe what? Yon talk of no reason, and yet you \u00abC\u00ab about te give me one.\" \"No, sir. What I n\u00bban is. that I dislike to give you a false reason , and U I were to pretend"], [414, "fclJll'H iU-.liO.'' \u2022 408 to give you one, it would not be the truth; and therefore it is that, from respect to you, I ask you to permit me to give you none.\" \" Very well ; I Uke that better than the false one ; and, to tell yon the truth, I have nothing whatever to do with who or what you are, so long as this paper is genuine. Look again at it, Mr Simpson. Has it the private mark npon it ?\" At these words \" private mark,\" the courier started. CHAPTER OLXXV. TOM RIPON AND OGLE MATERIALLY ASSIST IN THE B-.SCUE OF EDITH. The recovery of Jonathan WUd from the state of physi.-al and mental prostration into which he had fallen, was the commencement of a series of transactions comprising greut perU to aU oon oerned in them. The coach into which Edith had been handed had no one in it to all appearance. \" Yes,\" said Mr. Simpson, who was an attorney, \" this is the slip from the report that Mr. Recorder took to Windsor ; and on it, as usual when such tilings do occur, there is the King's pardon.\" \" Then, Mr. Oourier, Edith Heron can go back to Newgate, and wUl be liberated in the oourse of the day.\" \" Mr. Sheriff, are you a father ?\" \"Eh?\" \" Are you a father ? \u2014 for if you are, you will think that to be separated from an only child is a calamity whioh, as a father, you woild feel, although iu how much less a degree than a mother ! The infant child of the pardoned E lith Heron awaits her far off. Let her seek it at once, withont delays or forms.\" We say to all appearance, because there was y\u00abt a mystery connected with it that Edith had to discover. The horseman, that terrible courier, who had struck the guilty sonl of Jonathan Wild with so dismay, seemed to be the only person who had power or inclination to help Edith. And she wanted help. When once the notion found its way, throngh the sudden terror that had taken possession of him, to the mind of Wild that there might be some trick or jugglery in the whole transaction, he was resolved that such a queation should be set at rest \" Can that be done, Mr. Simpson i\" \" If the fees are paid \u2014 yes \" \" Then I wiU see to all that myse'lf,\" said the Sheriff. \"Here, sir; it will, perhaps, give you eome eati .faction to release the prisoner. Go \u2014 take her from the cart. She is free.\" With that yell of rage and defiance, then, which he uttered on the recovery of his senses and energies, began the strife. A strife for life ! \"Comradis!\" shrieked Wild to the officers of ihe police who accompanied him. \" Comrades ! follow me ! It is a good fifty guineas a man to you all if you do so!\" As he spoke, be gave his powerful horse the rein and the spurs, and dashed onwards. The crowd at the corner of Field Lane had with a loud shout of gratification and applause, opened and made way for the coaoh into which Edith had been so adroitly received. The show at Tyburn was noc at all spoilt by the abstraction of one prisoner from the death cart ; and the additional pleasure of annoying Jonathan Wild on the road was all to the good. The escape, then, of Edith was quite a popular affair. With his pencil the Sheriff wrote his name on the slip of paper, and handed it out at the coach window to the ghostly-looking courier. '\u2022 You wUl not repent this, air,\" said ihe courier, \" were you to live a hundred years \" As he spoke, he turned his horse's head in the direction of the cart, and rode up to it. The chief constable next to Jonathan Wild confronted him, for Wild himself was still com pletely nnnerved, and not able to speak or act. The couriei banded to tbe constable the slip of paper. A glance was sufficient to satisfy the man, and he exclaimed, \" A close touch this, but Edith Heron is free.\" Edith could not forbear a cry, and the tears came to her eyes. The conrier with the grey mask had backed the horse he rode as gently among the people as he could, calling out as he did so, \"Make way I \u2014 make way ! Let the coach pass, or the villain WUd will yet contrive something against the innocent Edith Heron !\" Tbe mysterious carriage that had been stationary ah this whUe at the foot of the hUl now drove np to the side of the condemned cart, and the conrier, placing his arm as a sort of raU helped Edith to get over the side of the cart into it. The oarriage was empty. Or it seemed to be so. The orowd parted Uke some huge wave. The coach dashed into the well-known Thieves' Lane. The ghostly conrier spoke not a word, but turned his horse's head towards Field Lane. Tbe mysterious conrier followed it. But Wild was, as we have said, rapidly recover ing his faculties, and the next application tho mob had was from him and his men, as they dashed up to the corner of the narrow and grimy thoroughfare. \" Out of the way I \u2014 out of the way !\" shouted WUd, \" or it wiU be the worse for eome of your skuUs ! Out of the way, and be hanged to you all!\" With a heavy riding-whip which he i_ai had hanging by its thong to the saddle, ha slashed light and left at the people. Tbe confusion became intense. The carriage followed. It was driven by a man iu an immense pow dered wig aud a three-cornered cocked hat and a very showy livery. Then Jonathan WUd, to whom, from a pubUc house in Fleet Market a good dose of brandy had been administered, sufficiently recovered his senses to look about him. He raised a yeU of rage as he saw that Edith Herou was no longer in the cart with the con demned. Oaths, shouts, ories, soreams, and imprecations of every kind that the genius of language could invent, filled tbe air, bat Jonathan WUd made no perceptible piogress. His horse was terrified."], [415, "EDITH KERON. 409 Wedged In by a ma_s of people, the horse did not see the way to proceed ; and as nine horses ont of ten wiU assure 11 y do iu such au emergency, the creature rather had an inclination to back than to advance. ments, and tbe blazing armorial bearings on its panels, was not above a couple of hundred yards before him. To overtake it could surely not be a matter of any difficulty. WUd raised another shout of triumph, and pushed on. Surely the coach was stationary \u2014 surely from some cause or another it had stopped, and Edith would be in his power again iu the next half minute. \"Charge!\" shouted Wild to the constables \u2014 \"charge and clear the way, or aU is lost I It's s matter of fifty guineas a man, and you are all losing it at the rate of five guineas a second !\" The constables formed tnemselves as hastily as they could into a compact body, and made a rush at the mob. His plan was to insist upon taking her back to Newgate, under tbe legal pretence of going through the regular ceremony of being duly discharged, and then to k.ep ber there until he had made fall and searching inquiry into Ihe circumstances that had brought about the reprieve. \" Hold !\" he cried. Some were thrown down Some flei to the light and some to the left. Many very serious injuries were inflicted, but the end of all was tbat the way was clear. Jonatnan Wild, with a shout of triumph, dashed down Field Lane. He waved his arm for the coustab'es who fat- The r-oach, with its rich and beaatUul adorn- No. 52.-Ed.th"], [416, "410 I.OIT1I KI-K.iN. lowed him to pause, and they puUed up then horses in a compact mass, entirely blocking np the narrow lane. WUd alone dashed forward to the coach. It stood a litUe on one side of the thoroughfare \u2014 on its right side of the way ; aud on that tic'e. consequently, there were uo means of passing it without going on to the pavement Jonathan, therefore, took the outside course, and in an instant more was at the tide of the coach. was tfore him had \u00abuddenly Organ to monut into the air, aud so had disappeared along with the courier, he would uot have been greatly surprised, although he might bave thought that the end of the world had come, and tbat his vooation had deported f r ever. But no such phenomenon took plaoe, and WUd suffered himself to be led out of Field Lane by hiimen in the midst of loud shouts of tcorn and derision from its motley population. What could he do bat accept the defeat he had experienced ? Edith was gene. The procession to T) born was far np Holborn toward St. Giles's Cbnrch \"Not jet, Edith Heron!\" he cried, \u2014 \"not yet are you free from ths clutches of Jonathan Wild !\" He stooped from his horse as he spoke, and looked in at the coach window. The vehicle was empty I Jonathan Wild yelled with rage, and loeked up to the co .chiiian, raising his arm with the heavy whip as he did so. There was no coachman ! The driver's seat was empty ! With a feeling ot desperation on his mind that fonnd only a temporary c insolation in some act of barbarity, be urged his hoise by wnip and spar to a frantic speed np Holborn. Perhaps be had a dreamy idea tbat, after all, he might fiud Edith in the cart witb the condemned, aud that aU that had seemed to have taken place would turn out to be but a vision of the imagination. We will leave Jonathan Wild to muse over these fancies, if he has them, until the reality disabuses bis mind of them. Tben Jonathan WUd became aware of another mysterious fact in connexion with the coach. The horses were gone ! The pale to which they had been attached stretched itself ont from the front of the coach. bare and gaunt bnt the two horses, w tb all tbeii baruess and traces, bad disappeared aa if the earth had opened and swallowed them np, closing over them again, and leaving not a trace behind. A cold shudder came over Jonathan Wild. We will now follow Edith Heron and her for tune! ou that eventfnl aud exciting morning. Upon stepping into tbe coach, Edith _aw at a glance that it was empty. At least, she thought she saw tbat, but appearances are uot always to be trusted From the ground where he stood he could Bee a good way dowu Field Lane, bnt uot the slightest. trace of horseman or horse conld he observe. To her great surprise, a head was popped op from under the opposite seat to where she sat, and a voice that she knew too weU to mistake, or be dubious about, addrestert ber The ghostly courier. \"\"h\" narriage horses. Edith. \"Bravo! *nd all right, Lady Edith. The little one it all a blowing aud a growing, and Jonathan Wild it done brown as a pancake, I shonld say, thi* time I\" All were gone I Gone as a wreath of smoke might go into the summer air and lapae into notbmgneat, even while yon lanty yon see its circling thadowy pic ture between you and the tnn. The tame terror that had come over Wild at the tight of the white face aud the temple wound of tbe courier, now beset him again with redoubled force. \" Tom Ripon ?\" Yet ; it was Tom Ripon who thus spoke, and whose head peeped out from under the teat of the coach. \" Oh, thank heaven I\" \u2022 xclaimed Edith. \"Amen, amen! a\u201ed lots of it,\" replied Tom, with a very iudi\u00bbtinot idea of what amen meant \" My husband, Frtix \u2014 oh, where it he?\" \" Ou a kctjw wilh a bit of white wax,\" said Tom He reeled on the saddle of the horse He dropped the reint, aud held with a feeble sort of gratp to the mane and tbe neck of tbe animal. The expression of his face wa* awful to be hold. \"What?\" \" Mr WUd is ill,\" said one of the mounted constable*. \" That's it\" \" But w< at do yon mean, Tom ?\" \" Why, Lady Edith, it seems to me as I have just told you. Ou a horte, I taid, didn't 1 ?\" \" Yet ; but how can lhat be ? An iron screw dj yon mean, Tom ?\" \"On, oh, oh! Oh, Lor' I Don't, Lady Edith \u2014don't kill a fellow with laughing! Toe screw it an old purbind 'ots, Lady Edith, as isn't worth fifteen shillings in this world!\" \" Very in,\" said another. * WUl you buy a bian new silk handkerchief my dear,\" taid a female who ktpt a fence in Field Lane for the rec ptio j of stolen property, aud who had jutt taken tbe ownei's name out of the sorner WUd shook hit bead. He neither saw toe woman nor the handker chief. \"A horse? ' \" Is it a dream ? ' he said, nervously. \" What Mr. Wild ?\" \" Yes, Lady E lith ; and the white wax is on the Captain's face, aud makes him look like the murdered courier from Windsor. But he will teU you all about that himself. Here we are I\" What Tom Rpou meant by ''Here we are !\" Edith had uot the least idea ; but the cotch sud denly stopped, and the djor next to the houses was abruptly opened. \" My Edith!\" \" Felix 1\" \"AUefit!

Another moment, and she was in the arms of Felix Heron, and was carriei into the house, a. tbe uoor of which the coaca had stopped. He was put surprises at th t time If the heavy, oamO.out old faml'y coach that"], [417, "EDITH HEE0N. 411 All she heard as she then orossed the threshold were tbe words uttered in Tom Ripon's voice of, \" Now, Ogle, quiok with the horses I\" Edith had had time to cast one look at Felix Heron, and the taw that it was he who played the part of the courier who appeared at the foot of Snow HUl. \" And I, too \u2014 I too, Felix ! Ou, I have suf fered woes that I shall never dare to think of! Our dear Uttle one ? Are you sure aU is weU?\" \" Quite sure, my Edith I\" \"Home! \u2014 oh, let us go home, Felix \u2014 home at once ! My heart to yearns for the sight of our ohild !\" The coating of pale yellow wax that he had placed over his face to imit .te the hue of death, he had partially rubbed off, aud she oould see the dear eyes that always beamed with kindness upon her. \" Ogle will let us know, my Edith, when it is time to depart\" \"Captain! Oaptain I\" \" Ah I he is here.\" Ogle, withont the coachman'* wig and hat lhat had no effectnaUy disguised him, put his head into the room. \" Oh Felix, Felix,\u2014 my own Felix!\" \" My Edith !\" \" Our child ? Our little one ?\" \" Captain, don't you think it would be as weU to be off?\" \" Well and happy.\" Edith rested her head upon the breast of Felix Heron, and sobbed aloud. \" Is the lane dear? \"Yes, Oaptain.\" \" Tou don't mean to teU me, Ogle, that Jona than WUd has given up the matter quite so easy ?\" \" Yes, Captain. A mortal fear came over him I never saw fright on a man's face show itself so strongly before. He is off ; but my i<tea, you see, Captain, it, that it won't last long He will come to his tenses again, and then, perhapi, we shall see a little too much of him.\" Tom Ripon, aud the coachman in the ample wig, who was no other than onr old friend Ogle, were not idle. The two hortes were unyoked from the car riage, and, with all their harness, were walked into the shop of the house where Heron and Edith had taken refuge. It was the shop belonging to the woman who had offered the handkerchief to Jonathan WUd for sale \" I comprehend yon, Ogle ; we must leave this place at one.\" The poor old horte, too, that Felix Heron had ridden, as the oourier, and which Tom Ripon had described, to the great mystification of Edith, at a \"screw,\" was likewise taken into the shop. All this was done while Jonathan Wild and his men were battling their way through the mob at the corner of the lane, and the bulk of the old coach was quite a sufficient aoreen for the whole operation. Need we say that that old famUy coach btlonged to the Earl of Bridgewater, aud lhat he had lent it to play its part in the proceedings of that morn ing ? The shop had at its door a flourishing display of silk handkerchiefs, whioh the horses dathed right and left in aU directions as they passed them. CHAPTER OLXXVI. FELIX HERON AND EDITH BEACH EPPIJ G FOBEST, BDT NOT WITHOUT FEBIL BY THE WAY. Ogle's opinion that WUd, to soon as he should recover from the fright tbat had taken possession of him, would take some active means of inter rupting the route to Epping Forest was an ex ceedingly correct one. If Edith and Captain Heron were to derive all the advantages possible from what had beeu already done, it could only be by making what speed they conld to the Forest \" See, Ogle, that the hcrses are ready, and we will start at once.\" The lady who kept the shop was an old friend of Mrs Ripon's, Tom's mother, and she knew him perfectly well. We cannot say, however, that in this caae she was wholly actuated by tbe romantic feelings of old acquaintanceship with Tom and hit mother, for the was well paid bv Felix Heron. The WQole of Field Lane looked on and taw what was taking place, bat there was no danger in that. \"Have yon horses here, Felix?\" asked Edith, with a look of surprise. \" Yes, dear Edith ; tbe two horses in the car riage weie Daisy and the horse that Ogle com monly has.\" \" Ab, I see it aU now I\" \" Yes, my Editb, you tee it all, and that heaven has permitted me to be successful in saving yon from the villain WUd I\" Field Lane, to a man, and to a woman, and to a chUd \u2014 we may almost go the length of saying to a dog and a cat \u2014 were sworn foet to all officers and police-constables whatever, and snch like troublesome persona But of aU those tbat they felt to be their foet, and between whom aud them it wa* war te the knUe, to the death, there was none that came near Jonathan WUd. \" All right, Captain!\" said Tom Ripon, now appearing at the door. - Come, Edith \u2014 come.\" There was a loud hnrrah in Field Lane, at Captain Heron, whose exploits were well known. issued oat of the shop past all the stolen silk handkerchiefs, with Edith on his arm. The two hortes were there. Therefore was it that although the escape of Edith was the mo\u00bbt public thing that could pos - sibly happen iu the laue, and although Felix Heron waa weU known, no one taid a word to enlighten WUd or hit men in regard to what had laken place The escape and all its arrangements met with popular apt ;oval, and was perfeosly tuccestf al. \" Dear, cear Editn,\" said Heron, \" this is the only moment ef peace 1 have kuown since that terrible night when jou were mat-bed from me I\" Baity looking as shining and as sleek as ever, and tnrniug her bead with a look of affectionate greeting towards Felix Heron. \"Hnrrah! hurrah! Three cheers for Oaptain Heron! Hnrrah I* The shouts surely were loud enough even to reach the ears of Jonathan WUd, at the top of Holborn, only he could not know what was their precise meaning. Heron wrapped a large oloak ronnd and ronnd Edith, and then lifted her to the back of Daisy."], [418, "412 EDITH HERON. \" She hears something on the dis ant air,\" said Heron, \" whioh it may be weU for ns to attend to.\" \" Oh, Felix !\" she said, \" wiU you surrender Daisy to me?\" \"Yes, Edith; and I am so confident of her docUity and sagacity, that I feel convinced if I was to say to her, ' To the Forest ! to the Forest,' she wonld find her way with you to Epping!\" Daisy looked into the face of Felix Heron, as though she would have replied to him, had she possessed human voice to do so, to the effect that that was perfeotly true, and she was ready to justify his opinion of her there and then. Captain Heron himself then mounted Ogle's horse. He waved his hand to the crowd, and then addressing Ogle, he said, \"You and Tom, I hope, will find your way to the Forest between this time and nightfall.\" \" Never fear for ns, Captain,\" called out Tom, before Ogle could answer. \"A couple of men like ns can always take good care of them selves!\" Ogle laughed, and shook hand* with Felix Heron, and then off they set. The cheers of the crowd in Field Lane followed them down its entire length, and they emerged into the region of OlerkenweU before they lost aU hearing of it Then, when once npon a high road, Heron turned to Edith, and cried out aloud, \" Dear one, let ns place what distance we may, in a gallop of half an hour, between us and aU possible pursuit\" \" Yes, Felix.\" \" Ou, Daily\u2014 on !\" In tbe next half-hoar that succeeded this sug gestion of Felix Heron's, nothing was heard but tbe steady beat of the horses' foet upon the road. More than once, though, the speed of Daisy bad to be checked, for the other horse was by no means able to keep np with her when she chose to put forth that tremendous gallop which sent her over the ground as if sbe had wings At the entrance to a littlevillage called Ditchliog Felix Heron drew rein, and caUed to Elith to stop. \" And I, too,\" said Edith. \"What can it be?\" Heron listened with all the intensity in his power, and even dismounted and bent his ear to the ground, but whatever sounds they were that disturbed Daisy, he oonld make nothing of them. The polioyof making what speed, however, they could to the Forest was sufficiently evident They started again, then, from the quick walk which they had allowed the horses to fall into, and at a gallop, although not so swift a one as that which had enabled them to pass so quiokly over the last few miles, they made their way towards Epping. \"FeUx! Felix I\" cried Edith, as she suddenly drew rein- 'What is this? Have we taken so long in coming from London, thus far ou our road, that the night has come npon us, or did we leave the city to muoh later than we thonght ?\" Eiith looked around her with a feeling of doubt and hesitation as she spoke. The sudden and extraordinary darkness that came over the whole landscape had something as strange as appaUing in its appearance. The sun had disappeared. A pale, sickly, greenish light had surronnded it Then tbat passed away, and the darkness bsoame quite equal to that of the evening, after the sun has set a g sod half hour. But it was a very different kind of darkness. An unnatural tint was npon everything, and the a:r had a preternatural stillness about it. The birds flew low, and uttered short cries of distress. A hare started across the road in evident terror. Edith mechanioallj' placed her hand in one of Felix Heron's as she looked inquiringly in his face. They were two-thirds of the way to Epping Forest. \" Ba not alarmed, dear Edith,\" he taid, quietly ; 11 it is only a storm 1\" It was about two o'clock in the day, and tbe sun, although white and squally-looking, was shining upon the grass in the meadows, and on the trees and hedgerows. How bright, and new, and beautiful did every thing look to Elith ! What a fair and exquisite sunshine there was at the heart now that she was free from the gloom and tqualor of Newgate, and felt that the fresh breezes of heaven were on her brow. She looked into the eyes of Felix Heron at she spoke in a tone of deep feeling. \" Ah, my Felix, it is necessary that we shonld in this Use, at times, feel the sharp arrow of af fliction, that we may know how to appreciate hap piness 1\" \" Yes, my Edith, it is so ; but the pangs of wretchedness I have felt while separated from you I hope and trust that for no reward under heaven, I may ever feel again.\" Edith was about to speak in reply, when they were both attracted to look olosely at Daisy, in consequence of the evident manner in which she had taken the alarm at something whioh their secies did not as yet appriz. them of. Daisy was at evid.ntly listening as if she had been endowed with the power of speech, and had eaid bo. Edith shuddered. \" Some terrible convulsions of nature only, Felix, can be ushered in by such premonitory signt as these.\" \"The rain-oloads do it all, Edith. Be not alarmed. The wont that can happen is that we get a wetting, aud perhaps by riding on onr way we may avoid even that by finding some place of shelter.\" A storm was indeed coming. One of those remarkable storms that only happen now and then in a peaceful and temperate climate, but which, when they do show them selves, find a place in the history of the country. Before Elith could say a word to Felix Heron iu reply to the last observation, a terrific and blinding flash of lightning lit up the scene, fol lowed instantly by the roar of such a peal of thunder as Edith had never before heard in her life. \" It has come !\" said Heron. \" Ob, Felix !\" \"Nay, my Edith, the danger is infinitely small Let ns ride on !\" Daisy took the storm with composure ; but the horse that Oaptain Heron rode had a disposition to be rather restive. The consequence of this was that they did not make quite such good speed as they resolved. The rain, however, had not beguu to descend The attitude of the sagacious oreature was a perfect stndy."], [419, "413 EDITH HERON. Edith, as ehe spok-, moved witti Daisy siUl closer to the side of Captain Jeron. \" No, no, Felix ! we will keep together !\" \" On, then, dear one !

In heavy drops that feU upon every object, and even upou the tolid eaith with a perceptible blow. They trotted on through the wood. The bridle-path widened. It suddenly opened out on to a little space abont the size of an ordinary bowling-green, beyond which some trees still appeared, bnt not tuffi ciently thickly planted to tbut out a view of an opeu road. AU the sonnds of human habitation, as well as the care that was bestowed upon the brid'e-patb, were apparent now. The route throngh tbe wood led directly to the door of an old and ruinous-looking inn, which stood embosomed among trees, and pre sented, take it for all, a most picturesque aspect A swinging sign announced that the name of the inn was \" The Woodman ;\" and with its thatched roof and its old gable ends, and many nooks and corners, it presented just that sort of appearance that was sufficient to excite the curiosity and interest of the passing traveller, and induce him, if his leisure served, to pull up aud remain for a rest at the pretty and picturesque spot. \" Edith,\" said Heron, \" yon must be fatigued, and tbe rain still falls heavily.\" \" Ah, Felix, you want me to pauie on the route to Epping, when yon know the loadstone that leads me on !\" Tbat lasted about a minute, and then, as if the floodgites of heaven were unloosed, and a second deluue was about to submerge tho earth and all that inhabited it, down came the rain. It was not possible to stand out against such a downfall ; and Felix Heron called out to Edith te make for a thick plantation which was to the right of the open road. He did not consider that the shelter of the trees wonld now be dangerous, since the commence ment of the rain had been the cessation of the lightning. Edith obeyed the cry of Heron, and turned Daisy's head in the directisn indicated. In another minute they were both in the shelter of the wood. The darkness there was most excessive, and it was a matter of sheer impossibility to see if any bridle path led through the plantation. But such a storm could not last long in its ut most fury. The darkest of the clouds had discharged their watery contents on the earth, aud although they were followed by others, yet the rain soon altered its character. It came down heavilv and steadUy, but more after the character of ordinary English rain. The day brightened, however. Edith and Captain Heron were able to look about them. \" But, dear Edith, you are half drenched with the rain.\" \" And yon, too, Felix.\" \" Nay, I spoke not of myself; I am used to aU kinds of weather.\" \" Here is a path,\" said Edith. \" Do yon see it, Felix?\" \" Yes, my Edith. I see it plainly now. It is a bridle path through the plantation, and leads to some easy road.\" Tbe question in the mind of Felix Heron now was whether he shonld return to the high road from whence they had diverged, or go through the plantation and look for a cross-road or byway that would still take them in the direction they wished to proceed. \" Nevertheless, we will stop here if you please, Felix, until the storm has gone over.\" Edith felt very happy. She spoke with a tone tbat kept perpetnaUy re minding Heron of the time when he used first to meet her, and love her more and more each time that he did so. The Bound of the horses' feet, although soft and nearly noiseless, upon tbe damp gronnd, brought forth a man from tbe inn. He was a low-browed, surly-looking feUow, and had the dress of an ostler. \"Which ihaU it be, dear Edith,\" he said, \" back again, or right through tbe wood ?\" \"On, on!\" said Edith. \" Daisy thought that there was danger on the high road, so we will not leek it again.\" \" On then, dearest !\" The bridle road that led through the Uttle plan tation was but a narrow one; but i; was quite evidenUy weU preserved, for not even a wander ing twig of the bramble was allowed to intrude across it. Captain Heron had often passed tbe little wood on the highway, and he knew its outskirts by sight very weU, but he had never penetrated into it They had not, however, proceeded far, when they saw rea.on to think that some habitation was near, for they tmelt fire, and heard a chopping noise, as if some one was, in spite of the storm, punning tome out-door labour among the trees. Edith and Heren came to a halt It was desirable to know whither they were \" Want to bait here ?\" he asked. \" Yes,\" said Heron, \" if it makes no difference to you, my friend.\" The surly ostler did not seem able to come to a satisfactory conclusion as to whether these worda from the stranger meant a compliment or a sar casm, but he growled out that he would take the hortes. \" Exactly,\" said Heron. \" But I mnit see where you take them to.\" Heron dismounted, and ts did Edith, with his assistance, and then they saw both tbe horses placed temporarUy in a shed that well enough protected them from any cross current of cold air. \" No oats,\" laid Heron ; \" enly some damp, fresh hay.\" \"Very well,\" growled the osUer. Heron then, with Edith on his arm, who ho thonght looked pale and jaded for want of food, entered the inn. Tbe first person they saw was a morose-looking man, wbo appsared half inclined to stop them from coming into the passage. There was a something, however, abont the \"ShaU I venture, Edith, or shall we turn baok ?\" \"No, BOl\""], [420, "414 WITH H7.R0N. look of Captain Heron which generally had its 'fleet upon such people, and the man got out of tho way. \" Hoy ! Miisut ! Missns I\" he cried. \" Here's somebody ! Hoy !\" A woman appeared whose appearance was a long way from prepossessing. \"What do you want here?\" was tbe ronghly put q-iestion. \" A short rest, and such refreshment as an inn ought to afford,\" replied Heron. \" There's the ' Wheatshetf ' further on, near Epping.\" . I know it\" tray, on which were arone ooarse eartben nngs, and ore larger jug with tbe milk. The brown bread that came in with this primi tive repast was of tbe coarsest and commonest description. \" Yim will find it wholesome,\" said tbe woman, \" if it it not jntt so fine as what yr.n get at the quality inns and taverns in London.\" \" Set it down,\" said Heron. The woman left the room, and Heron was pour ing out for Edith some of the milk, when he noticed some brown-looking liquid swimming, so to speak, in it in a suspicious manner; and much as milk itself will swim abont in tea or coffee for awhile without mixing with it if poured in gently. What was it ? \" Hold, Edith ; yon must have none of this !\" \" What is it, Felix ?\" \" I know not ; but the suspicion of fonl play is enough, without testing it by running any risk* \" A scratching noise at the door attracted their attention. \"Go there, then.\" \" No ! It suits me to stop here just now, and stop I will I\" \" Come away, Felix. Do not disputowith tbem,\" whispered Edith. But the woman, like many people who, if given way to, will be oburlish to the extent of abnse, when she found that 6he produced no effect but one of opposition on Captain Heron, altered her tone. They heard a snarling, sivage-like noi*e of a dog who was intent upon getting into the room. \"What does that dog want here, 1 wonder?\" said Heron, as he went to tbe door to open it But the door was fait \" I was only afraid there was nothing in the honse that tbe lady would like to take. That was all\" \" We will chance tbat,\" said Heron. With Edith on his arm, Captain Heron made his way right into the passage of the inn ; and then the man wbo bad first seemed at if half in clined to dispute their entrance, came forward in a very cringing manner, and rubbing his hands together, spoke. \" I'm sore, missns, the lady and gentleman wonld like the green-room.\" \" To be sure they wonld,\" said the woman \" This way, if you please \" \" Any room,\" said Heron, \" will do, till the storm has passed over.\" The woman led the way to the first and only floor above stairs of the house, if we may except some lofts in the roof. It resisted aU his efforts to throw it open with out he adopted some mode of forcing it * Why, what is the meaning of this ?\" he ex claimed. \" The door fast ! Thi* is too absurd ! Do these people fancy they can make us pri soners ?\" \" Oh, let us leave this place at onoe!\" said Edith. \" I like it not.\" CHAPTER CLXXVII. JONATHAN WILD GETS THE START OF HERON AND EDITH TO THE FOREST. Opening a door, she ushered them into a much larger room than they had expected to find in the houte from the outside. The dog kept scratching at the fastened door of the room, and uttering those savage, snarling sounds which indioated a desire to be mischievous. Heron reflected f&r a \"W moments. \" Edith,\" he said, \" I think this is anything bnt the kind of place we should desire to remain in.\" \" Let us fly, Felix.\" \"Yet, dear; bnt I am more afraid of the dog than the people. I shonld Uke to dispose of him first\" \" I'm sure,\" she taid, \" you wiU get here just what yon wUl find sufficient\" These words did not at the moment make any impression upon Felix Heron or upon Edith ; bnt they both well remembered them afterwards. \" Some milk and any bread that yon have wiU anffice,\" said Heron. \" Certainly, sir.\" The woman left the room, and Edith and FeUx were able to look abont them in tho rather strange place they were in. It was, as we have taid, rather a large room, and, for the house It was in, tolerably furnished. What struck both of tbem, however, as rather singular, was tbat the windows were securely fastened down with screws, to that it was not pos sible to open them to get a breath of air. In one corner of the room, or rather in a recess at one side of it, was a large wardrobe or cabinet of some sort, made of some mahogany, which in time had become nearly black. \" Edith,\" said Captain Heron, \" we wiU get ont of this place at soon as we possibly can, for it is not one that I have any fancy for.\" \" Nor I, Felix.\" \"Then let ns rafter take to the rood at once \" How, Felix ?\" \"We will fay.

Heron was not the man to hesitate long under suen convictions. \" Indeed! Holloa, my men do you hear that?\" \" We do, Mr. Wild.\" \" If those wera not the people we wanted, why then there are two Captain Herons in the world ard two Ediths.\" He took hi. p'etols from his pockets, and care fully examined the charges and the priming, as he taid, \" My Ed'th, we wiU not remain here any longer.\" \" No, FeUx \u2014 ns longer.\" \"Hush!\" The woman of the inn listened eagerly to what Jonathan Wild said ; but the names were entirely strange to her, and she could make nothing of his worda \"Ob, what is it?\" \" An arrival I I bear Sh* sound of hows' feet We wUl manage, at all events, to see who it is.\" By standing quite close to tbe window, Heron found that be could look down into tire little space in front of the inn. WUd then strolled in his cool leisurely way into tbe house. All tbe dialogue was easily overheard by Cap tain Heron and Edith. The difficulty In which they found themselves was great What was his surprise to see there arrive a group of horsemen, tired and drenched wfth the storm, at tbe head of whom rode no other than Jonathan Wild. How could they hope to escape the scrutiny of Jonathan Wild, if he shonld make np his mind to an investigation of the inn ? The people of the hostel, nnder any other oir cumstanoes, might have been of efficient aid ; bnt being what they were, it was more terrible to be at their mercy than even to faU into the hands of Jonathan Wild. \" House! honse!\" cried WUd. \" Are yon all atleep here in this out of the way den yon call an inn ?\" \" Edith,\" said Felix Heron, \" I fancy our perils are a little on the increase ; for, to tbe best of my belief, that is Jona'han WUd, with a ttrong ptrty in pursuit of us, who bave just arrived?\" \" Are we lost, Felix ?\" \" No, dear one\" * Tben I bave no fear.\" \" What tball we do, Felix ?\" asked Edith. \" Are we not in great danger?\" \" Perbapt a little, dear Edith ; but not much. Let ns carefully examine this room : who knows but we may And some mode of outlet from it?\" Edith eagerly assisted Felix Heren in the ex amination, but nothing presented any elements either of secrecy or of suspicion, but tbe huge old oabinet, or secretaire, whichever it might most correctly be caUed, whioh occupied a recess in the room. It wa* lofBdent for Edith that he in whom ihe had *nch absolute faith should be confident of success. There wa* no complaint, no tears, no fainting. She set herself to work to help him who she knew wonld help her with his Use. \" Halloa !\" they heard the voice of WUd again shouting ; \" have you any brandy in tbe honse ?\" \" To be sure,\" replied the ostler, who had made hi* appearance. \" Get it out, then Anybody here bnt ns, eh ?\" \" Why\u2014 I\u2014 a \" \" No,\" cried the woman from the open door, a* \u2022he heard the question. * No, nobody here now. We had tome, who had come out of the storm, but they have gone home now, quire a long journey.\" \" S ve thinks na dead, my Edith,\" (aid Heron. \" The poisoned mUk, no doubt, would have done it* work I\" It was locked. Bnt to Felix Heron that was no great difficulty, as he toon forced the lock back, and opened the folding doors. Those doors oreaksd ominously a* they were opened. The wardrobe, for such it seemed now by its internal fittings to ba, was nearly empty. Some scattered articles of clothing alone were there, but nothing suspicions presented itself, until Felix Heron took hold of one of those articles \u2014 a kind of pelisse, edged with for \u2014 and gave it a sharp pull. It resitted the pull, and wonld not oome ont of the wardrobe. \" Horrible ! oh, horrible !\" \" It i* \u00bbo ; bnt with heaven's help we wUl foU them yet\" There wa* something, after all, too peculiar in the way in which the woman spose for it wholly to escape tbe observation of some of the men who were with Wild. One of these touched him on tbe arm as he whispered, \" This be tbat inn, Mr. WUd, called ' The Woodman,' which we were set to watch closely abont a year ago, owing to several people having mysteriously disappeared abont this spot. Don't yon remember, sir?\" \" Ah, yes, I do now. And this is tbe place, is it?\" Heron then became naturally enriom to know what it was that detained it ; and, npon stooping to make the examination, he taw that a portion of one of the lappels of the fur pelisse was wedged into a crack or seam, in what appeared to be tbe floor of the wardrobe. \" There is a trap-door here, Edith,\" said Cap tain Heron. Edith shrunk back and held Heron by the arm, although they were neither of them snSciently close to be in any actual danger, even should the trap-door be loose and opening downwards. \" I think,\" added Heron, that the teoret of the disappearance of traveUers at ' The Woodman Inn' is sufficiently apparent\" \" It it, indeed.\" Edith shuddered. Captain Heron now wished to try an experi ment on tbe trap-door. He selected the heaviest of the old chairs that were in tbe room, and placed it en the treacherous floor of tho wardrobe. \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" As he spoke, Jonathan dismounted from his horse, and flung the bridle to one of his men to take charge of. In a ttiff, engainly manner, for he was cramped by being so long on horseback, Wild approached the inn door. \" What sort of people were they who stopped here last ?\" be a> ked. \" A man and a woman."], [422, "416 EBITH HERON. The trap-docr oreaked open a few inches. Another chair produced weight tnffioient, and down went the trap and tbe two chairs disappeared. Toe trap immediately then that the weight had \u25a0lid i ff its surface into some abyss beneath, re sumed its former position, having all the appearance cf being the ground-floor of the wardrobe. Under these oirc_m stances there could be no longer any rational doubt in regard to the state of affairs in that place. Murder was tbe rtd'nary feature there; and Edith and Captain Heron had bit npon the mode by which the dead bodies of th__r poor victims were disposed of. What was to be done ? i \u25a0 .mi, through the secret panel in .the wall, was one of them. And now the panel wa* far enough on one side for a head and face to appear. Was it the face of the morose ostler, or of that woman so destitute of all that should belong to a feminine nature ? No. Far different was tbe fair and geatle looking countenance tbat showed itself to Felix Heron and E-i'h from tils other aide of tbat panel. With a look of Ri-d cnrios'ty in the large hazel eyes, the face prrs?nt-td i he appearance of that of a young lad thi it, en or fourteen year* of age. A cap of b'a-k velvet with a tassel of tilt, wa* npon his head ; aod his dress, likewise of velvet, had a foreign air aud appeal ance abont it. Bat the cap, as well as the dness, waa both stained and worn. If Jonathan Wild and h's myrmidon* had not been below, the whole affair wonld not have cost Heron a moroenti tho-ght for he wonld have broken down the door of the loom, and at once, with Edith, sallied forth. But a fight to tbe death with WUd and a party of well-armed officers of the polioe wa* not to be thought of. Edith then uttered an exclamation, as she pointed to a particular part of the wall of the room. Oaptain Heron's attention was immediately directed to it, aud be saw it move. The movement wa* so Blight that he, as well as Edith, had they not both seen at tbe same time, might well enough have fancied their imaginations had deceived them. The face, pleasant beautiful, and ingenuous as it looked, had an air cf grief and depression about it The boy spoke. \" I was hiding in the bushes,\" he said, \" aud I saw you both come into the house, and my heart told me that you were kind and good, aud that from you I had nothing to fear, bnt, perhaps, all to hope.\" These words were perfectly inexplicable in the latter part, to Edith and Felix Heron. What could there be to hope for from them ? and what conld that yonng lad think they could aid him in ? But it was a fact. A large panel of the old wainscot of the room shook. With a light bound the lad passed throngh the opening in the wall, and approached Edith. He took both her hands in his as he taid, \" Oh, lady, I am sure you will help me to find my fattier, who came to this inn this morning early, and so strangely disappeared that I seem as if 1 knew I should never look npon him in Ufe again. He wore a fur pelisse, which he bought in Hungary, for we have travelled much ; and he was to good, so kind, that if he ha* gone from me, I would fain follow him.\" Then it moved very gradually on one side. Both Edith and Herou kept their eyes fixed npon it as U it were some itrauge fatoination from whioh they had no power to escape. Aud what, undir all the circumstances of their presence in that house, wss more remarkable still, consisted in the fact that not the least idea of any danger came across their minds. They seemed to assume that whoever, in this most mysterious way, was making an entrance into the apartment, must of necessity be a friend ; although o-rtainly, situated as they were, they might mnch more justly have looked for an euetuy. \" A fur pelisse !\" exclaimed Captain Heron. \"Hush!\" said Edith. With her delicate, feminine tact, she fancied that Heron would say enongh to rend the heart of the young lad wi'h all the agony of grief for the murder of that father he spoke of with such ten derness. Suoh feelings are, however, things far beyond our control. Nature, amid all her mysteries, gives us hints and pieces of knowledge, arising from we know not what; and this conviction on the mind of Felix Heron aud Edith, that they had nothing to fear from whoever was about to look into tbat The finding of the fur pelisse in the wardrobe was too terrible an evidence of what had become of it* wearer. Heron saw what Edith meant and he ohecked himself from saying more to the boy. END OF VOL. L"], [423, ""], [424, ""], [425, ""], [426, ""], [427, ""], [428, ""]]
