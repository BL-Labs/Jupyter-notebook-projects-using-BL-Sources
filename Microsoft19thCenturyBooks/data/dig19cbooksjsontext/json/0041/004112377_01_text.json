Go not hence : And when the noontide sun shall parch thy brow, Go quaff the cooling draught my reapers share.\" But she, confounded at the kindly tone (For strangers hear few words of gentleness), Fell down in grateful homage at his feet, Her country's custom ; then, with faltering breath, \" AA^herefore, my lord, such favour shown to me, A stranger woman, and in face and speech"], [143, "RUTH. 123 Unlike the maids of favoured Israel?\" \"No stranger, Ruth,\" he said, \"for well I know Thy kindness to Naomi since the day Thy husband died, and how for love of her, Leaving thy father and thy mother and Thy native country, thou art come to us, A people all unknown to thee before.

And when the night-cloud fell she threshed it out, And found that she had gathered grain enough To furnish forth their frugal board with bread For five whole days : thus God had prospered her. Then scarcely bending 'neath the lightened load, With steps responsive to her joyful heart, She glided homeward through the darkening streets.

There was an ancient law in Israel, If one died childless, that his next of kin Should take the widow and preserve his name ; And if the heritage were pledged or sold, He should redeem it : this Naomi knew, And, harvest ended, calling Ruth, she said : \" My daughter, shall I hug a bootless grief, Nor care to find a peaceful home for thee ? That were an ill requital of thy love ; Do therefore my behest Thou knowest well That Boaz is our kinsman, and should do A kinsman's part to thee and to the dead.

( Translated from Ovid. ) EASURELESS is the Might of heaven ; and limit knows it none ; The gods above pronounce their Will, and it is forthwith done. In proof whereof an Oak and Lime stand on the Phrygian hills, The space within a ruined wall their mingled shadow fills. With my own eyes I saw the spot (by Pittheus' order sent To Pelops' country, where his sire late held the government) ; And not far off a vast lagoon, once rife with busy men, But now a reedy haunt for gulls and many a water-hen. Upon a time came Jupiter, and visited the land In mortal guise ; and Mercury, caduceus in hand, Accompanied his mighty sire ; his wings were laid aside. Before a thousand homes they stood, and piteously cried For warmth and rest : a thousand homes the simple boon denied. Yet there was one, a lowly roof of straw and rushes made, AVhich entertained the wanderers and tendered needful aid. There kind old Baucis and her mate Philemon, old as she, Had been united in their youth a loving pair to be ; And still within those cottage walls, when their sweet youth was gone, They lived and loved together till old age came creeping on. Making no shame of poverty, they felt its burden light. And sweet contentment always kept their simple dwelling bright. Ask you for master, mistress, man, or maid ? No matter : they Are only two, and both command, and both in turn obey."], [274, "SECULAR POEMS. 254 Now when the denizens of heaven knocked gently at their door, And bowed their lofty heads to pass the lowly threshold o'er ; Philemon bade them rest their limbs upon the couch he set, On which attentive Baucis spread a home-spun coverlet. Then busy at the hearth she moves the useless ash away, And lights with arid bark and leaves the fire of yesterday, And fans the flame with aged breath. This done, she chops with toil Sere boughs and pine-logs from the roof to make the kettle boil. She next a cabbage from the hands of her good man receives, Cut in their watered garden, and pares off the outer leaves. He no less hospitably bent, lifts down on two-pronged fork, From blackened beam whereon it hung, a well-cured side of pork, Cuts a small portion from the chine he long had joyed to save, And sinks the bacon severed thus beneath the bubbling wave. Lest the delay might irksome prove, the courteous pair meanwhile, AVith simple entertaining talk the lagging hours beguile. There was a tub well-wrought in beech suspended from a hook By a curved handle : from its place this tub Philemon took, Filled it with water warm and soft, then bared their tired feet, And washed away the travel-stains, and soothed the throbbing heat. Soft sedge they piled upon a couch supported on a frame Of common willow ; underneath, the legs were of the same ; And this with hangings they concealed, not often thus displayed, Except to grace some festival, yet they were old and frayed, And with the couch of willow-wood a famous match they made. The gods reclined. The aged dame, with gown tucked up before, And trembling hands, proceeds to place a table on the floor. Three legs were long and one was short, and so a tile was found, And dexterously wedged between the short leg and the ground. Thus when the sloping side was raised, and all was levelled well, They rubbed it over with fresh mint to give a pleasant smell. Then olives of the purest kind, and green with twofold shade, And autumn cherries soaked in wine upon the board were laid, With endive and with radishes, and clotted cream to spare, And eggs among slow embers poached and lightly turned with care."], [275, "PHILEMON AND BAUCIS. 255 But everything on earthenware : and after these they lay A goblet chased by skilful hand, but likewise formed of clay AVith cups of manufactured beech, such as the makers line AVith a smooth coat of yellow wax to glorify the wine. No tedious delay is here : the viands leave the pot, And straightway from the fire upon the table are placed hot. The wine a little space removed can boast no wealth of years, Yet after the dessert is served a second time appears. Ah, here are walnuts, figs, and dates within the rugged shell, And plums, and in a basket broad ripe apples sweet of smell, AVith purple grapes in bunches rare, fresh gathered from the vines, While virgin honey in the midst of all this bounty shines ; The beaming faces of the hosts smile welcome over all, And seem to say, \" We do our best, altho' that best is small.\" Meanwhile the goblet, emptied quite, they see replenished stand, And the wine secretly increase unpoured by human hand ; The host and hostess terrified, with pallid faces stare, Astonished at a sight so strange, and mutter many a prayer, With supplicating hands, that their illustrious guests would deign Excuse their ceremonial scant and a repast so plain. There was a gander, only one, the hissing sentinel, AVhich kept their tiny farm from theft, and guarded it right well : This bird they now resolve to slay, their visitors to grace ; But swift of wing he still escapes and mocks their tardy pace. At length, as if entreating help, close to the gods he flies, And they, in pity for the bird, forbid the sacrifice. \" And we are gods,\" they said, \" come down to bring destruction due Upon this wicked neighbourhood, but we will care for you ; Only consent to leave your home and follow while we guide Your steps to find a safe retreat on yonder mountain side.\" Obedient both to the command with trembling limbs they went, And leaning on their trusty staves toiled up the steep ascent. A bowshot from the top they turned, and saw the lower plains All deluged by a spreading lake : their roof alone remains."], [276, "256 SECULAR POEMS. And while they stand in wonder lost, and mourn the sudden fate Of their drowned friends, they see the cot, their humble home of late, Transformed into a temple fair. Twin columns meet their view, Instead of. wooden props ; the thatch assumes a yellow hue ; Pavement of various marble now conceals the earthen floors ; And roofs of glittering gold appear, and richly graven doors ! Then spake these words, great Saturn's son ; his voice was kind and low : \" Say, good old man and worthy wife, what boon shall we bestow ? \" A little while Philemon spake in Baucis' ear apart, And then revealed their mutual wish, and opened all their heart. \" The priest and priestess let us be, your sacred shrine to guard, And since our years together spent no discord ever marred, Let the same moment take us both, that I may never see My darling's grave, and she likewise may never weep for me.\" The gods kept faith : they had their wish \u2014 were guardians of the fane So long as it was theirs to live. One day by chance the twain Were standing, quite worn-out with years, the temple-steps before, Telling the story of the place so often told before, AVhen Baucis saw Philemon into branches burgeon out, At the same time Philemon saw his faithful Baucis sprout ; And now, before the lengthening stem o'er their two faces grew, They faltered mutual farewells \u2014 \" Dear husband \u2014 wife \u2014 adieu ! \" And while they spake, a leafy veil was hiding them from view. But still the Cappadocian shows two trunks which, side by side, Are joined in close companionship that Time cannot divide. I heard the story from the lips of seniors wise and true : Why should they wish to cozen me, or I to cozen you ? And I myself saw garlands gay suspended overhead, So fastening my own fresh wreath upon the boughs, I said : \" The Powers Above descend from Heaven to help the good and kind, And whoso courtesy extends, like courtesy shall find.\""], [277, "CAMILLA.

Seeking the woodland crown of mountain wild He carried in his bosom this sweet child : But hostile weapons gleamed from every glen, And round the pathway scoured the Volscian men. Thus, fleeing for dear life, he sees at length The Amisenus foaming in full strength, Swollen by the rain that deluged all around, And overleaping its accustomed bound.

What shall he do ? A hundred projects past, He hit upon this bold resolve at last : It chanced that in his giant hand he bore A mighty spear, some knotted oak tree's core ; At first he swathed the babe from side to side With cork-tree bark, and then securely tied, Midway between the iron and the haft, The living burden to the oaken shaft. Poising the spear he made its balance true, Then looked to heaven, and prayed before he threv \" O gentle virgin, goddess of the grove, Latona's daughter, heed a father's love. Protect the child devoted to thee here, Who flying clasps the shaft thou holdest dear, An infant suppliant \u2014 O, accept this care, And guide her dangerous voyage through the air.\" Then drawing back his arm, with sudden force He launched the weapon on its venturous course. The angry torrent roared; but far o'erhead The whizzing spear and hapless maiden sped. Then Metabus, the foremost foeman near, Swims o'er the stream and hastens to the spear ; Torn from the turf, he sees, through Dian's grace, The babe unhurt, and smiling in his face. And, since no roof, no walled city, gave The shelter his proud soul disdained to crave ; Thenceforth among the lonely hills he went, And spent his days beneath the shepherd's tent ; And fed his babe, in cave and woodland lair, By pressing from the teat of willing mare The milky stream : his little maiden quaff 'd AVith pouting lips the invigorating draught And when her tiny feet could scarcely stand, He placed a little javelin in her hand,"], [279, "CAMILLA. 259 And o'er her shoulder slung a baby bow, AVith baby arrows in a glittering row.

She, thus equipped, began betimes to fling The dart, or round her head to whirl the sling, And strike the Thracian crane in rapid flight, And slay the wild swan in his aery height. Then through the Tuscan cities many a dame Each for her son preferred an eager claim ; But the wild maiden scorned the nuptial call, And loved her mistress Dian more than all, And laughed \u2014 and shook her arrows at the foe, And lived a virgin huntress, pure as snow.

From grange and fields she drew a rustic throng Of youths and maidens as she marched along.

Or if compelled a moment to retreat, O'erpowered by numbers, turning in her seat, Her bow reversed, she pulls the twanging string, And floats a cloud of arrows on the wing.
