I. in the famous Baron's letter to the Pope, where William de Fer rarijs styles himself \" Dominus de Groby.\" John (of Chartley) is not amongst the writers, and both John and William con tinued to be summoned to the end of their lives without any such distinction in the Writs ; nor was Robert who succeeded John and was the last of the Chartley line summoned, called by any but his Christian and surname ; the first use of any such distinction in the writs themselves, appears to be in 1 Ric. II. when Groby and Wemme are so distinguished, and continue to be so.\u2014 Writs to the Chartley line ceased after 16 Edw. III. 1342. During an interval of 120 years from 1342 to 1461, Ferrers of Chartley had no writs. In 28 Hen. VI. the male line failed, and the sole daughter and heir having married Walter Devereux he was summoned to Parliament as Lord Ferrers, anno 1 Edw. IV. and the title continued regularly in that line till the time of Chas. I. when it fell into abeyance amongst the coheirs of the Earls of Essex ; but the abeyance being terminated by King Chas. II. anno 1677, in favour of the issue of Lady Dorothy Shirley, the Barony has continued to be enjoyed by her descendants, and is now vested in the Marquis Townshend. Ferrers of Groby continued without intermission from 25 Edw. I. to 20 Hen. VI. when that line ended in a sole heiress, and Grey her husband was summoned 25 Hen. VI. &c.

Dugdale commences his account of this family with Robert Despenser, so called from his office, being Steward to King William the Conqueror, and enumerates the lordships which he held in several counties, but does not speak of his issue, nor does he call William Despenser, whom he mentions next, the son of Robert, or describe Thurstan as the son or descendant of either. But Edmondson, and other writers since Dugdale, have made Thurstan the son of William, and William the son of Robert. I have considered this matter with much attention, and do not find any reason for believing that Robert was the progenitor of Thurstan. If he had any issue at all, which I rather doubt, I should be inclined to conjecture that the Marmions were his descendants, for it is certain that they were afterwards possessed of many of the lands which in Domesday Book are ascribed to him. The office which Robert held under King William the Conqueror was in the time of King Henry the first held by one Hugh, which Hugh was the son of Thurstan. This is proved from the Records of the Abbey of Abingdon, wherein it appears that the said King in the fifth year ofhis reign (a0 1105) gave to the said abbey 10 hides of land in Sparsholt, then in the pos session of Hugh (son of Thurstan) Dispensator Curi\u0153 Regis; that the same year the said Hugo Dispensator came to Abingdon and did homage to Faricius then Abbat, promising to perform all those services which Thurstan de Turbeville had formerly done, and that in the second year after the death of Abbat Fari cius, the said \" Hugo Dispensator Regis Henrici primi \" did, with the consent of Helewisa his wife, give to the said Abbey the tithes of all the profits (de omni pecunia) of the manor of Spers holt which he held of the said church. In this Hugh and Thurstan I trace the father and grandfather of that Thurstan with whom the pedigree begins, and my opinion is confirmed by a circumstance which seems to place it beyond a doubt, viz. that"], [20, "6 ADDITIONS TO DUGDALE'S BARONAGE. Geffrey le Despenser, who was father of the Chief Justice/ held this very land in the time of Henry the Third. Even from Thurstan the descent can only be traced with cer- tainty by public records for two or three generations. Thurstan had issue Walter and Almaric. Walter died without issue, as appears by a grant to his nephew Thurstan in a0 13 Hen. III. who is therein styled son of Almaric Le Despenser, brother and heir of Walter Le Despenser son of Thurstan, being a confirma tion of the lands of Wordy and Stanley, which the King's grand- father (King Henry the Second) had formerly given to the said Walter.

A view of some of the conflicting statements and authorities may be seen in Baker's History of Northamptonshire, vol. i. 108. The asserted connexion of the house of Wormleighton with the Chief Justice, is not supported by that proof which renders pedigree valuable. Upon this subject Mr. Townsend makes the following note : \" The family of Spencer of Wormleighton and Althorpe recorded its pedigree at the Heralds' Visitation of the county of Northampton in 1564 (H. IV. in Coll. Arms) beginning with Sir John Spencer of Hodnell, in the county of Warwick, Knt. who died in 1521. At that time no pretension was made to a descent from the Despensers or of any relationship to the Earls of Winchester and Gloucester, nor was there the least similitude in the arms. \" Clarenceux Lee in 1595 made a pedigree for the then Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton and Althorpe, in which he drew the descent nearly in the manner in which Dugdale has given it ; he professes to have compiled it from divers re- cords, registers, wills, and other good and sufficient proofs which he had diligently and carefully perused, and in his character of Clarenceux King of Arms he con- firms and allows it officially. Whatever the proofs were which he saw and examined, I confess that I cannot give implicit credit to his work.\" V e Joan, widow of Adam ; Assignatio dotis in Oxon, an. 34 Edw. I. Esc. 34 Edw.

The wife of Almaric, to whom the charter of King'John was granted, was Alda Bluet, i by whom he had two sons, Thurstan and Ralph, as appears by the following : \" Ego Thurstanus Dispensator Dni Regis Anglie consensu Radulphi Dispensatoris fratris mei Rectoris Ecctie de Rollendrith et vol im itate Dne matris mee Aide Bluet et Lucie uxoris mee dedi moni alibus de Godestowe jus patronatus Ecctie de Uleberne.

II. ; so that from that time the entire Barony was vested in Tho3 Boteler ; yet there is no writ of summons to be found for him altho' he lived till the 22d year of that reign ; nor do I find any traces of a claim.

II. \u00b0 and so Thos Boteler became the sole heir of all Sudeley's lands \u2014 But he was never summoned to Parliament, and there had been a regular discontinuance of writs in the Sudeley line from the 14th of Edw. II. to 41 Edw. III. when the last Lord Sudeley of that name died. The extinction of the dignity, however, is not to be inferred from this circumstance : for in the case of the Barony of Fitzwarin there had been a constant cessation of writs from 9 Edw. III. to 27 Hen. VI. and then Bourchier, who had mar ried the heir general, was summoned by the title of William Bourchier, Knt. Lord Fitzwarin. 1 therefore consider Tho mas Boteler as heir of the Barony, tho' I do not find him so sum moned, and shall continue his descent under this article (copy from Dugd. vol. i. 596, beginning at line 62, and ending with line 1 p. 596b.) The wife of this Thomas Boteler was Alicia, daughter of Sir John Beauchamp of Powyke, Knt. by whom he had issue four sons, John, William, Thomas, and Ralph, and four daughters, Elizabeth, Jane, Margaret, and Eleanor.P All the sons except Ralph died issueless, and two of the daugh ters, Margaret and Eleanor, died unmarried. The time of John's death I have not been able to ascertain more precisely than that it happened during the lifetime of his mother, who had taken for her second husband Sir John Dalingrigge, Knt. and died in 21 Hen. VI. seised for the term of her life of the manors of Sudeley, Derset, and Greve aforesaid, at which time her son Ralph was found to be her heir and 40 years old. This Ralph being a Knight (copy from line 4, p. 596b, to \" Com.

His son Sir Thomas appears to have married Eleanor, daughter of the renowned Lord Talbot, the first Earl of Shrewsbury \u2014 she survived her husband, and was \u2022 Esc. 3 Ric. II. no. 63. i' Coll.

It is true that the marriage with Lady Elizabeth Grey took place in the lifetime of Lady Eleanor Boteler, but is remark able that the eldest of Edward\"s children was not born till two years after the Lady Eleanor's death, which happened in the 8th year of King Edward.1\" By the Inquisition taken after the death of Ralph, it appears that he died seized (as in line 15, p. 597, down to Knight inch in line 22, where instead of \" by \" insert \" son of.\") P. 597, 1. 29.

Note. Margaret, mother of the last John survived ; and in the 1st of Edward III. presented two petitions to the King, the one for 13 shillings and fourpence out of the manor of Wick hampton which she had in dower, the other for the manor of Syde in the county of Gloucester, which she held as a partner with her husband, and gave them to her son for his life, and he being slain in battle against Hugh Despenser, the King (Edw. II.) gave them to Hugh Despenser the father, l who withheld them from her by his greatness, and now they were in the King's hands by forfeiture of said Hugh, to which it was answered, \" Let certain persons be assigned in Chancery to inquire,\" &c. In the Inquisition taken after her death, it appears that her son held the manor of Sherington, in the county of Wilts, as parcel of his Barony ; that she held for life the manor of Clifton, &c. that her son died in the month of March, a0 15 Edw. II. and that Joan, daughter of Alexander Giffard, and John, son and heir of Edith sister of the said Joan, cousins of John Giffard (her son), were his next heirs, viz. the said Joan and Edith, daughters of Alexander, son of Gilbert, son of another Gilbert, brother of Elias Giffard, grandfather of the said John. \u2022 See issue in Vine. 31, 199. \u2022 Rot.

M. T. IV. ACCOUNT OF THE CHURCH OF BEDWYN MAGNA, IN WILTSHIRE, WITH A LIST OF THE VICARS, AND EXTRACTS FROM THE PARISH REGISTERS; AND OTHERS FROM BEDWYN PARVA, FROXFIELD, AND EASTON. The Church of Bedwyn Magna, dedicated to St. Mary, is the largest, and altogether the finest, in the hundred of Kinward stone, in the county of Wilts. It is built wholly of flint, with the exception of ihe buttresses, quoins, doorways, and windows, which, together with the internal ornaments, are of good free stone. The plan is cruciform, consisting of a nave with aisles, a transept, and a chancel, from the intersection of which rises a massive tower, surmounted by open-worked battlements. The capitals of the columns in the nave, and the mouldings of the arches, are of rich Norman character, especially the former, which"], [35, "21 ACCOUNT OF THE CHURCH OF BEDWYN MAGNA. exhibit much variety of design, and have been lately restored with great care to their original perfection. It is probable that this, the oldest part of the building, was erected towards the close of the twelfth century, just at that period when the round or Norman style was yielding to the lighter and more elegant forms of the Pointed or Early English order, and before the latter was exclusively adopted. The character of the ornamental work is Norman, but the structure itself is Pointed, bearing in general appearance a close analogy to Wimborne Minster, Llanthony Abbey, and other examples of the intermixture of the two styles. The chancel is very plain, with narrow lancet-shaped windows, that at the east end being divided into three lights. The transept displays the richer style of Edward the Third's reign, and the north and south windows are very peculiar, and perhaps unique in design. The remaining portions of the building, including the ailes, west end, clere-story, and tower, are later, and boast not of much architectural beauty. The internal dimensions of the church are, length of nave 62 feet, space under the tower 25 feet, length of chancel 38 feet, whole length 125 feet. \u2014 Length of transept 85 ft. 8 in. ; width of nave and ailes 46 ft., of chancel 20 ft. 3 in., of transept 19 ft. 9 in. ; height of tower outside 60 ft. ; its square outside, north to south 26 ft., east to west 25 ft. The chancel has been the burial place of several of the Sey mour family, but there are only four epitaphs to their memory. That to Sir John Seymour is engraved upon a tablet of alabas ter, and is placed within a large circular-headed niche, on the north side, near the east end of the chancel. Below, is a shallow altar tomb, supporting the recumbent figure of a knight clothed in mail and plate armour, his head resting upon the helmet, and his feet upon the figure ofa lion. The material of this tomb is a very soft stone, which is rapidly giving way to the effects of time, and, although something has been done towards renewing the armorial bearings and inscription, much remains to be ac complished for the preservation of the tomb and effigy. The fol lowing is the inscription : \" Here lyeth intombed the worthie Sr John Seymovr of Wolphall Knight: who by Margerie his Wyfe, Davghter of Sr Henry Wentworthe Knight, from whome the nowe Lorde Wentworthe is discended, had Six Sonnes and Fower Davghters *.

Le Sore, of St. Fagan's (co. Glamorgan) by the dau. and heir of Huntley.\" With this descent the arms on the Great Bedwyn monument agree. Morgan Wolfe had also two sons, David and William Wolfe, both of whom mar- ried and had issue. This Morgan Wolfe must not be confounded with the gold- smith to Henry VIII. whose name was Morgan Phelppe, alias Wolfe. He made his will 10 July, 5 Edward VI. 1550, which was proved 31 May 1552, and it is re- markable that he names a daughter Barbara then unmarried, also his sons Julius, Walter, and Thomas, besides other children, neither of whom appear in the other pedigree."], [37, "ACCOUNT OF THE CHURCH OF BEDWYN MAGNA. 23 his own Coste and Chardge, the laste daye of September, Anno 1590, in the xxxn year of the moste happye Raigne of ovr gratiovs Soveraigne Ladie, Qveene Elizabeth.\" Above the inscription is placed a shield of arms, bearing the ensigns of Sir Henry Seymour, Knt. viz.

On the floor of the chancel, near to Sir John's monument, is a brass plate inscribed to the memory ofhis eldest son : \" Here lyeth the body of John Seymour sonne and here of Sr John Seymour Knight & of Margery oon of the daughters of Sr Henry Wentworth Knight, which decessed ye xv day of July, the yer of or Lord mv[c]x, on whos soule Jhu have mcy & of yor charite say a pater nostr & a ave.\" It is probable that this John Seymour was removed from the ruined Priory church at Easton to this grave, at the same time that the body ofhis father was brought hither, and that the hrass plate, together with the Purbeck slab into which it is inserted, was also brought from Easton.

(See p. 33.) \" Bellocamp53 eram, Graia genetrice, Semerus; Tres habui natos, est quibus una soror.\" On the north wall of the chancel, towards the west, is a hand some marble monument to the memory of Frances, second wife of William second Duke of Somerset. A well executed bust of the Duchess forms part of the design. \" Here lyeth, near to the body of her husband, ye most noble Lady Frances Devereux, daughter of Robert Earle of Essex, and widdow of William Duke of Somerset, who dyed April the 24* 1674, aged 74 years and six months.

Dom: 1706.\" The coat of arms is Seymour, impaling Argent, a fesse Gules, in chief three Torteauxes, for Devereux, the whole in a lozenge surmounted by a ducal coronet. There are no other inscriptions in the chancel ; and in the church, there are only two monuments. These may be noticed for their antiquity. One is the recumbent figure of a cross legged knight in armour, supposed to be the effigy of Sir Adam de Stock, who died about the year 1313, possessed of the manors of Stock in this parish, and of Rushall in this county. His widow, Geva, married secondly Robert de Hungerford. The shield of arms is still distinguishable, though much decayed. The bear ings are, Argent, five bars Gules, over all a bend charged with three escallops of the Field between six martlets Sable. The other tomb covers the body of Sir Roger de Stock, son of Sir Adam, who died 1333, seised of the manor of Wolf hall and of lands in Savernake Forest. On the top stone is the impression of a brass in the shape ofa cross, with a long stem and graduated foot. A line of inscription runs along the outer edge of the stone, but it is very indistinct. The first three words are sufficiently legible, ' ' Roger . de . Stocre . Chev.\""], [39, "25 VICARS OF BEDWYN MAGNA.

Mrs. Becher was Jane daughter of Hungerford, of Fifield, in the parish of Milton, co. Wilts. She was buried here, 10 June 1743, but there is no epitaph to her memory. There is a tomb over her two sons, Charles Becher, jun. Gent, who died 14 March 1732, aged 8 years and 6 months ; and Henry, who died in his infancy. VICARS OF THE PARISH OF BEDWYN MAGNA. The earliest Vicar on record was Thomas Dogeson, to whose memory a brass plate still remains in the church ; he died on the 7th of December 1500. Richard Yonge, mentioned in the Ecclesiastical Survey of 26 Hen. VIII. 1535, is the next of whom there is any account. Joseph Smith is the first vicar entered in the Institution Re gisters of the Deans of Sarum (this being a peculiar under their jurisdiction), which commence in the year 1548. On his cession, William Wingfield d was presented in 1564, by Thomas Bla grave, Esq. who sat for Bedwyn in the Parliament of 13 Eliza beth, and was connected with the Hungerford family. Henry Shawe was presented on Wingfield's resignation by Sir Edward Seymour, Kt. in 1573, and again in 1574, by the Queen. Richard Baylie's name occurs several times in the Registers e as vicar, between the years 1576 and 1582, when he was buried; but there is no entry ofhis institution in the Dean's Register, Roger Glass appears to have been instituted in 1581, the year before Baylie's death, on the presentation of the Earl of Hertford. \u00ab The epitaphs in the church and churchyard of Great Bedwyn, 1821, are printed in Sir Thomas Phillipps's Collection of Monumental Inscriptions in Wiltshire, Part II. pp. 171 \u2014 180.

ABSTRACT OF A DEED OF FEOFFMENT RELATING TO \" THE GARRETT,\" NEAR WANDSWORTH, IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY, THE SCENE OF THE CELEBRATED MOCK-ELECTION. The humours of the mock-election at Garrett have not only been chronicled in the Gentleman's Magazine a and in the Every Day Book,b but have had the higher honour of giving employment to the satirical pen of Foote, and to the still more powerful pencil of Hogarth. A spot which industry and genius have thus combined to render celebrated, deserves a larger share of the attention of the Topographer than has been awarded to it in the volumes of Manning and Bray.c A docu ment, of which the following is an abstract, indicates the early history of \" the Garrett,\" and exhibits also its condition in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The celebrity of the persons mentioned in this grant gives it another claim to attention ; and a third claim will be found in the means which it affords of rectifying several blunders of the county historians.

It appears by a memorandum that the deed was acknowledged before John Orphinstrange, a Master in Chancery, on the 20th March 1564, and by an indorsement, that it was enrolled in Chaucery upon the dorse of the Close Roll, on the 26th of the same month. J. B. X. PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A BRANCH OF THE FAMILY OF CAREW, SEATED IN THE COUNTY OF CORK. It appears from Smith's History of Cork, that, in the reign of Henry IV. the Marquis Carew was at the head of the nobility of that country. Sir William Betham has shewn that the no bility of Ireland, so late as the reign of Edward III. were lords of Parliament by tenure, called tenure by barony. Whether the Marquis Carew were a lord of Parliament does not appear, but it is very probable he was, as were certainly the Viscounts But tevant, whose title of Viscount originated as incomprehensibly as that of the Marquesses Carew. It is manifest from every part of Smith's history, that the Carews had vast possessions in the county of Cork, almost from the first conquest, and that they built many castles. The printed pedigree of the Carews of Haccombe states, that William Carew married a daughter and coheiress of Stephenson lord of Cork ; and from the same it ap pears, that his son, grandson, and great-grandson intermarried with Irish families, after which all connection with that country seems at an end. It is notorious that the wars of York and Lan-"], [108, "94 PARTICULARS OF THE FAMILY OF CAREW, caster called away great numbers of the Anglo-Irish, and that the Irish and degenerate English broke in on their possessions, and held them by force. In this way it seems that the heads of the Carews lost their lands and their nobility by tenure- In the reign of Elizabeth Sir Peter Carew came from England and claimed half the county of Cork and the barony of Hidron in Carlow ; but his death put a stop to all proceedings. Some junior branches, however, of the Carews continued in Ireland. Among the castles stated by Smith to have been built by the Carews, was the castle of Garrivoe, in the barony of Imokilly. Sir John de Carew was appointed a conservator of the peace in that barony in tlie year 1346.a With the reduction of the county of Cork under English law, in the reign of James the First, the records of this branch begin to appear. I have before me a commission dated 15 Au gust 1618, from the Lord President and Council of Munster to John Carew of Garrivoe, and Edmond Fitzgerald of Ballymc Coadie, esquires, directing them to sequester the corn growing on certain land which was disputed at law, lest the defendant should convert it to his own use. It is signed, Ric. Gething, Un. Cler. Cons. This is a curious process of law. Something similar would be useful in the present day, when tenants manage to leave their farms owing several years' rent, and, favoured by the delays of an ejectment, carry off the crops also. In 1622, Robert Carew, son and heir of John Carew, had livery of his father's lands, held in capite by military service, for which he paid the Crown 16/. In 1638, Sir Robert Carewe, of Garryvoe, knight, Ellis Lady Carew his wife, and Edward Carew their son, mortgaged Mony mearig containing 25 acres, and Tobbirdowrane containing 10 acres, with part of the rent of Rathaha to Edmond Fitzgerald of Ballymartyr, esq. ; the deed mentions that Tobbirdowrane was then in lease to Philip Frauncis of Ballyknockane, yeoman. He was doubtless an ancestor of the celebrated Sir Philip Francis. In 1641, Robert Carew, esq. son and heir of Sir Robert Ca rew, late of Garrivoe, knight, had livery ofhis father's lands, for which he paid 12/. 6s. Sd. It does not appear what became of Edward Carew. In the document granting this livery is also a separate grant to Hugh Gratrix, gent, of the wardship of Joanc, Rolls of Chancery in Ireland lately published."], [109, "SEATED IN THE COUNTY OF CORK. 95 Eylin, Honora, and Ellena Barrett, daughters and coheirs of Ullicke Barrett, late of Currebehy, in the county of Cork, gent. deceased. In a list of Mr. Carew's evidences, dated 27 Nov. 1653, some others of the Carew family are mentioned, as in the following extracts : \" A lease of Ballyknochan and other lands made by Robert Carew the elder unto Sr Rob1 Carew. \" Sr Rob1 Carew's resignation of tearme of years to Mr. Carew. \" A bond of Redmond Magner and James Barrett to perform covenants with Mr. Carew touching the intermarriage of his * T sister Joane with Redmond. \" Redmond Manner's bond of 260/. sterling. * A bond of the Lady Elizabeth Carew and her son Edward unto Capt.

Smith, the elder, and John Smith, the younger, that Mr. Carew was neither privy or ptie of plundering their houses, &c.\" Note. \u2014 I have transposed some of these extracts as the order of time seemed to require. At the foot of the list is the following, which seems to be a draft of an intended certificate : \" Whereas at the enemies last being in this Barony, on the 1st of this month, among the rest of their plundering, burning, and praying, John Carew, of Garyvoe, esq. hath been at the loss of 200/. worth of corn, besides 2 goodly tatch houses, which have been all burned on the lands of Ballyknockane neer Bally matir, and all his tenants corn and houses there have' been also burned, and their cattle carried away by the sd ptie, wch at the instance and request of the sd Mr. Carew we do hereby certify"], [110, "96 PARTICULARS OF THE FAMILY OF CAREW, that to our knowledge he and his tenants have sustained what is above specified.\" Among the papers is the following certificate : \" Whereas to our particular knowledge John Carew, of Gar rivoe, esq. hath bin a man constantly adhering to the English, & in opposition to the designs of the Irish rebels, and that at such times as we were commissioners in the Barony of Imokilly, he the sd John Carew, to manifest such his integrity, did declare unto us seueral intentions of the enemies coming into and pray ing upon this country (which he had learned from some by him employed to disclose the same) by which seueral services in this kind as our pty had many preservations, some [ ] (by the assurance of very good hands) that the enemie was thereby [ ] incensed against Mr. Carew, and did about Michaelmas last was two years (when they made a strong incursion into this Barony) fully resolve his destruction ; but by a Divine Providence miss ing of him, they repaired towards his lands of Ballyknockan, & there burnt his houses & barn, wtb at least 200/. worth of corn thereon being, utterly untenanting & wasting his lands ], all wch being taken into serious consideration, we then, as well by a message from [ ] then Commissioners of revenue received, as our own knowledge of the ayme the enemy had to prejudice him, & that although he had seueral kindred then among them, yet they were only such as designed him to destruction, did think it [ ] to free him from any charge of kindred money then impressed on others in the Ba[rony].

Joshua Boyle.\" The kindred money here mentioned, probably was the penalty of bonds passed to magistrates, or military commanders, engag ing for the future peaceable demeanour of Popish kinsmen, who might by their acts have incurred suspicion. In the list of papers before mentioned are these items : \" Coll. Saunders certificate, discharging Mr. Carew of the"], [111, "97 SEATED IN THE COUNTY OF CORK. bonds wherein he was bound for Mr. Poer, Mr. Robiston, James of Glenan, and Geral of Drcmaddy. b \"A bond of 10,000/. of the above parties to save Mr. Carew harmless in his suretiship for them.\" The next document I find, is an adjudication \"by the com missioners for the adjudication of claims and qualifications of the Irish ; \" dated 2 Nov. 1655. It sets forth, that the claim of John Carew, of Garrivoe, in the county of Cork, gent, being heard, it appeared that he had made good title to the lands in his said claim, mentioned within the eighth qualification of the act, and adjudged him to have in Connaught or Clare 820 acres of profitable land, in lieu of his said lands, &c. saving to his High ness the Lord Protector and Commonwealth of England all other right, 8cc. By patent dated [ J March 13th, Charles IL Sir Henry Tynte had a grant of various lands, and among them Garrivoe, containing 145 acres, and Raghah 101 acres. 18 April 1661. John Carew, of Garryvoe, in the county of Cork, esq. petitioned the King, setting forth, that he had no hand in the plunders, &c. against the Protestants in 1641, or afterwards, having lived under the protectiou of the English garrisons. That for no other cause than his religion and loyalty he was repulsed out of his estate and possessions, as well of his own acquisition as of the lands which came to him from his bro ther, who died several years before, and was peaceable, &c. That, without Petitioner's privity, a decree was sued in his name for lands in Connaught; that he dissented, and never entered the same at Loghreagh, but disclaimed ; and that he was a person restorable to his former possessions and lands. His Majesty referred this petition to the Earls of Donegal and Drogheda, and Viscount Loftus, or any two of them. Afterwards Mr. Carew obtained a letter from the King, and under his hand, which is dated 16th July 1661, stating, that on perusal of a report of the Earl of Drogheda and Viscount Loftus, and of the certificates therein mentioned, the Irish Privy Couu- b The surname of these two last was become so common that it was no distinc tion, and their places of residence are substituted. They were probably Fitz Geralds, among whom, as well as among other numerous families, a patronymic compound of \" Fitz,\" and the father's christian name, was often used, the sur name in such case being written without \" Fitz,\" or sometimes entirely omitted. VOL. V. H"], [112, "98 PARTICULARS OF THE FAMILY OF CAREW, cil were of opinion that the Petitioner should be recommended to his estate, notwithstanding any grant made to Sir Henry Tent, and ordering the Commissioners for executing the public Declaration to restore him to his village of Garrivoe, and to all his manors, &c. whereof he or his mother was dispossessed by the usurped power, without putting him to expect for previous re prisals, being not \" by our said public declaration \" requisite in the case of the Petitioner, being an innocent person \" who hath not taken lands in Conaght or Clare,\" and notwithstanding any grant made of any ofhis said lands to the said Sir Henry Tent, or any person whatsoever. \u2014 This letter is addressed to the Chan cellor, Justices, Lieut. Deputy, or Governor or Governors. The difficulties, however, of satisfying all parlies were so great that Carew was never restored, and Sir Henry Tynte afterwards obtained another grant of Garrivoe. Neither does it appear that he got any other lands in Connaught or Clare ; so that by seeking much he seems to have lost all. It appears that in 1636 Sir Robert Carew mortgaged the lands of Ballyhemekine for 540/. to Morris Roch and Meilcher Lavallen in trust for Edmond Roch. In 1715 a Robert Carew, supposing he had a right to redeem it, laid a case before John Rogerson, afterwards Chief Justice of the King's Bench, the land being, as there stated, in the possession of James Roch, son and heir of Edmond. A copy of this case, with Rogerson's opinion, remains, and from it I extract the pedigree, as follows : John Carew. Sir Robert Carew, Knight. ! Robert, d. s. p. Mark. John.

Robert probably died without issue, for the family papers con tinue with the descendants of Thomas. This Thomas married Susanna Frankland, of the family now seated at Ashgrove, and had issue Mark, John, and two other sons, who left Ireland ; one of them was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, the other a mer chant in Lisbon. Mark married Miss Russel, daughter of Colonel John Russel ; and his brother John married Eli nor, daughter of Richard Schooley, esq. of the county of Car low, by Jane Russel, another daughter of the fore\"*oino*"], [113, "99 SEATED IN THE COUNTY OF CORK. Colonel John Russel. Mr. Schooley, I believe, had another daughter married to Carrol, and a son, who left his estate to his illegitimate son. The Carews at this time were all Pro testants: probably Thomas was the first who conformed. Mark had a son, John-Russel, in holy orders, and three daughters, Jane, wife of Ogleby; Philippa- Maria, died unmarried; and Anne, wife of Russel, esq. of Ballydavid, in co. Tip perary. The Rev. John Russel Carew married Miss Wood, and had issue, 1. Mark (who married his cousin Miss Wood, and left a daughter Anne) ; 2. John-Russel, bred a solicitor, but reduced by improvidence and irregularities. He married Miss Roe, sister of the late Captain Roe, of the regiment, and left two sons; 3. Thomas, who died unmarried; and 4. Robert, late a Major in the army. John Carew had by Miss Schooley three daughters, Jane, Susanna, second wife of Thomas Kift, and Catharine, wife of Thomas Chatterton, brother of Sir James Chatterton, Bart. The ruins of Garrivoe castle still remain. Colonel John Russel, above mentioned, was of a branch of the Bedford family which seems to have had much connection with Ireland. His son Thomas was Archdeacon of Cork. Peter, brother (or nephew) of Thomas was governor of Tipper Canada, and his brother was governor of Lower Canada. Mrs. June Schooley, before mentioned, married secondly Luke Little, an officer of cavalry, by whom she had Letitia, who married Colonel James Cockburn, and had issue the late Lieut.-General Sir WTilliam Cockburn, who succeeded as 5th Baronet. Another daughter of Colonel John Russel married Mr. Wilcocks, and had a son William, Mayor of Cork in 1793, who settled in Ca nada when Peter Russel was governor. Colonel Christopher Russel, another of this family, was governor of Minorca, where his youngest son was born, who was afterwards rector of Skull, and another of poems, &,c. a volume of which was published after his death. Perhaps some other correspondent could give an account a of this branch of the Russels ? Cork. 11 We shall be glad to receive what this anonymous correspondent proposes. The Russells of Ireland branched off from the main stock so early as the thirteenth century : in Wiffen's Memoirs of the House of Russell, vol. i. p. 532, is a pedi gree (by James Terry, Athlone herald), commencing with William de Russell, Baron of Lecale, A.D. 1200, but closing with Charles Russell, then of Cadiz, an ldherent of King James II. \u2014 Edit. h2"], [114, "* A 100 XI. GROUND PLAN AND CHARTERS OF ST. ANDREW'S PRIORY IN THE PARISH OF MARRIGG, NORTH RIDING, CO. EBOR. The account of this Benedictine Nunnery in the new edition of the Monasticon, is taken from Clarkson's History of Richmond, whose sources of information were apparently limited to the ecclesiastical sur veys, the confirming charter of Edward the Third, as printed from the transcript on the charter rolls by Dugdale, who omits a considerable portion, and to the meagre notice in Burton's \" Monasticon Eboracense.\"' The documents, which through the kindness of W. C. Tupper, esq., in whose possession they remain, I am enabled now to make known, form nearly a complete series of all the grants made to this religious esta blishment, inclusive of the original charter of the founder, Roger de Asc. This is addressed to Archbishop Roger, who was consecrated to the see of York in J 154, some few months before the death of King Stephen; hut as the Archbishop, in his letter of protection and ratification, ex pressly affirms that Roger de Asc had established his own daughters and others, to serve God on his patrimony in Marrigg, with the consent of his suzerain, Warner son of Wyoinar, and of Couan Earl of Richmond. the date of the foundation cannot be earlier than 11G5, 11 Henry II. when Conau became possessed of the Earldom. Pope Alexander the Third is said to have confirmed the foundation, but the bull is not among the evidences. By the founder, the advowson of the parish church was given to the new community, and a portion of it appropriated to them for their place of worship. The nuns' choir, as shown in the Plan, occupied the western half of the nave ; the other half, with the chancel, on the north side of which was the chantry of the family of Asc, being left for the use of the parish. The church has in quite recent times been reduced in size, and the former chancel is now without a roof.3 Great part of the nave was on that occasion pulled down and rebuilt, using the old materials \u2022 but the steeple, with its bell-house, remains untouched. The monastic buildings were on the south aud west sides of the church (see Plan), and the extent of the cloister court may still be traced, but the structure is almost wholly destroyed. Instead of the convent being placed on a small farm, as Mr. Clark son supposes, the endowment of Roger de Asc comprised a third part of the entire vill of Marrigg, a whole carucate, the boundaries of which arc thus set forth in the deed -viz. from the Elm-pool in the river Swale \u2022 See the engraving in Whitaker's Richniondshire."], [115, ""], [116, ""], [117, "101 CHARTERS OF MARRIGG PRIORY. by the road called the Rails-gate to the hill called Wechnesberg, and so by the hill siJe to where the church tofts join on to those of the village. and from thence by the side of the wood to the beck running into the road which comes from Backstone-grave, and from thence by the beck to the Swale. The Virgin Mary was, it seems, joined with St. Andrew, to whom the parish church had been dedicated, in the patronage of the conventual establishment. In the deeds sometimes both patrons, sometimes only one, are named ; as in the charter of Henry II. where the name of the Virgin only is introduced. Examples of the contrary practice are, how ever, more frequent, and the name of St. Andrew's priory appears to have grown into settled use, though the convent seal continued to bear the impress of the Virgin and Child. a MARRIGG.

Of this ancient and honourable family the only genealogical ac counts which I have found are in Nos. 1551 of the Harleian Ma nuscripts, and 4964 Addit. MSS. Brit. Mus. being Munday's collec tion of Middlesex Descents ; in which but two generations are entered, and those bear the appearance of having been regarded by the compiler as doubtful in their affinity to each other. A descent or two down to the Baronet is also preserved in a similar collection, made and taken A.D. 1690, by the heralds St. George and Le Neve, in the College of Arms. The pedigree, now for the first time pub lished, is chiefly deduced from the parish Registers of Harefield, the wills of the family abstracted from the office of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and the monumental inscriptions in their private burial-place in the Church of Harefield, the names and dates of which only are given by Lysons in his \" Middlesex Parishes ; \" some coats of arms, omitted by him, are also supplied ; embodied with such slight notices as have been incidentally found in other works of authority both printed and manuscript. a * A description of the mansion of Breakspears, at Harefield, and its armorial decorations, is given in the Gentleman's Magazine for Sept. 1823 ; but it may here be noticed that, from the disordered arrangement of the stained glass in the hall, some of the impaled coats remain unidentified, which otherwise would throw a light on the respective intermarriages, and others are missing or mis- appropriated ; as in the shield assigned to Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick, 1569, the first five quarterings are supplied by a fragment, and the four following, viz. 6. Ar. a chev- ron wavy between three roses Gu. [Manyford, or Modiford, of Mudford, co. Somerset.] 7. Gu. three lions rampant Or. [Fitz-Roger, alias the Lady of Chuton, co. Somerset.] 8. Ar. on a chevron Sa. three towers with cupolas A. .] 9. Az. three leopard's heads inverted, jessant de lis Or, [Can- telupe of Chilton Cantelupe, co. Somerset,] are the quarterings of the Stukeleys of Afeton, co. Devon, with which family it must be conjectured the Ashbys had formed some alliance, though uo evidence of it is afforded by the Visitations, be- yond the apparently unauthorised statement in the Baronetage of 1727, quoted hereafter, p. 127."], [142, "126 PEDIGREE OF THE FAMILY OF ASHBY From the pedigree now given, it will be seen that one of this family, Sir Francis Ashby, knight, was created a Baronet by King James the First in 1622; a dignity he did not long survive, dying without issue male in 1623-4, at the premature age of one and thirty,*> leaving an only daughter and heir Alice ; <* the title thereupon be came extinct, and it was evidently so considered by Collins, the editor of the first printed Baronetage 1720, as he entirely omitted any account of the family ; yet, notwithstanding, in the next edition of the Baronetage, edited by Wotton and others in 1727, appears an account, assigning to four persons respectively the title of Baronet, as lineal descendants of Sir Francis Ashby, who, as was alleged, by an alienation of the family estate in favour of his younger son, had so impoverished the representative of the title, as to induce him to accept the humble situation of a servant at a farm at \" Hadsko \" in Norfolk. By whom, and for what ends, this account was furnished, so de cidedly at variance with the all-sufficient and positive nature of the evidence now adduced, relative to the Baronet and his issue, viz. the will, registers of baptism and burial, and monumental inscription, can only be conjectured. It appears to have been an impudent at tempt on the part of the Haddiscoe Ashbys to assume the honours of a family to which they were not in the least entitled, if indeed there was any relationship, which has not been ascertained. Its spurious character is further shown by the fact that in the alleged descent of the title two persons were passed over, the claimant's own elder brother and his father's elder brother ; see the table in the opposite page, in which the statement of the Baronetage is combined with the actual dates from the register of Haddiscoe, procured from the ori ginals, and obligingly communicated to me by G.

There is so much of confusion in the preceding account that I have found it necessary to go into a very minute examination of the whole, and therefore it will be more easy for me to state in my own way the result of my research, than to propose alte rations in the text. There were certainly two persons of great distinction of this name flourishing as early as the time of King Henry the Third, viz. Walter de Chandos, Lord of Snodhull and Welinton, in the county of Hereford, and from whom descended that Roger de Chandos who was summoned to Parliament by King Edward the Third; And Sr John de Chandos, who married Margaret, daughter and coheir of Robert Fitz-Walkeline, from whom descended the famous Sr John Chandos, the celebrated hero of Poitiers, the friend and companion of the Black Prince, and one of the foun ders of tbe most noble Order of the Garter. h The Arms assigned to Jennings of Birmingham, in Nichols's Leicestershire, iv. 859, (see before, p. 129,) are totally different from the coat given here, which is precisely the same as that quartered by the present Earl Howe, in virtue of his descent from that family."], [158, "142 ADDITIONS TO DUGDALe's BARONAGE. How this Walter and John were related to each other I have not been able to ascertain, though I cannot doubt of the fact : their arms were alike, differing only in the colour of the field \u2014 a resemblance which at that time would have been proof positive of consanguinity. It does not perhaps fall strictly within the letter of my plan to pursue the descent from John, because none ofhis posterity ever had summons to Parliament ; yet as Sir William Dugdale has thought fit to notice them, 1 shall take leave to follow his exam ple, and discourse of that line first, in order to clear the way for the discussion of that which is more immediately the subject of my inquiry. Sir John de Chandos by Margaret his wife, daughter and co heir (with her sister Ermentruda, wife of Sir William Stafford) of Robert Fitz-Walkeline, was father of Sir Henry Chandos, who was living in a\u00b0. 16 Edw. I. whose son, Sir John Chandos, married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Brailsford, and had issue Sir Edward Chandos, to whom King Edward the Third, in the first year of his reign, granted an annuity of 40 pounds, payable out of the Exchequer, until such time as he should provide him with forty pounds in lands, or rent of equal value, in reward and encouragement ofhis good services, \" et ut arma militaria que in Comitiva nra de precepto nro recepit de cencius valeat continere;\"a which Sir Edward having married Isabel, daughter and at length (by failure of issue from her brothers Edward and Robert13) coheir of Sir Robert Twyford, bad issue one son named John, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Eleanor, and Margaret. This John, following the example of his father, engaged in the military service of his King, and by his wisdom as well as his valour gained the admiration and applause of his contempora ries, and, what is far. more rare, appears to have secured the un qualified approbation of posterity. I shall not enter into the particulars of his history, which is sufficiently known, further than to say, he died without having been married, and conse quently without issue, and to notice by the way a mistake in Froissart or his translator, who, in speaking of Sir John's uncle, calls him Sir Edward Clifford instead of Twyford.

This Inquisition certainly states the truth as far as it goes, but not the whole truth ; it states, however, all that was necessary to the purpose for which it was taken, though not all that was ne cessary to the purpose of a complete knowledge of the genealo gical history of the sisters of Sir John ; for Eleanor, who at the time of that Inquisition was the wife of Roger Colyng, had been previously married to a friend and companion of her illustrious brother, named Sir John Lawton, and having survived her sister Elizabeth Chandos, who died unmarried, and her niece Isabella Annesley, she became at length sole heir of her said brother,d and in that character, upon a writ of Formedon in descender, in a0. 22 Ric. II. recovered against Sir Wm Detbick, knt. that portion of the inheritance of her brother, which had upon par tition been allotted to her niece Isabella Annesley, the said Isabel having died without issue. By her first husband Sir John Lawton, the said Eleanor left an only daughter and heir named Elizabeth, who married to Peter de la Pole, of Newborough, in the county of Stafford, esq. and their posterity inheriting the estate of Radborne, in the county of Derby, from this marriage, were afterwards distinguished by the title of the Poles of Rad borne.

The settlement is first upon Roger himself and the heirs of his body, and for want of such heirs, remainder to Thomas, son of the said Roger, with other remainders as before specified. Now, if Tho mas had been the legitimate son, he must have come within the first limitation, for the heirs of the body of Roger could not fail as long as Thomas (if legitimate) or any issue from him existed; so that the settlement appears as if it had been made for the purpose of substituting an illegitimate offspring in case of the failure of lawful heirs.f P. 503 b, add to the references from the fourth paragraph, Esc. 49 Edw.

The Inquisition taken after his father's death states him to be then 26 years old,s and in 51st year of the same reign he paid 100 marks for his re lief of the manors of Snodhull, Fowhope, and Welynton, in the county of Hereford, held of tbe King per integrant Baroniam de Snodhull)1 His niece Margaret Mattesdon left a son Robert, who was 25 years old at her death, a0. 14 Hen. VI. ' and the ' This was not an uncommon practice at that time, as might be shewn in many instances ; but 1 think I see the possibility of such a situation respecting the issue of Roger as might reconcile the legitimacy of Thomas with the settlement in ques- tion, viz. It is possible that Roger might have had a former wife, and that by such wife he might have had a son and one or more daughters ; that he foresaw a probability of that son surviving him, but no prospect of bis furnishing issue to continue the line ; and that in such case the rule of the prqfessio fratris would make the sisters of the whole blood heirs to their brother by the first venter, and so preclude the succes- sion of the sons by the second, and break up the entirety of that possession which had descended upon him from a long line of ancestry. In such a situation, and having a number of sons by his second marriage, he may be naturally supposed to wish to continue the inheritance in the male line. If this conjecture be admitted, it appears to me that all is reconciled ; for the lands being settled in the first in- stance upon Roger and the heirs of his (sed q.J body, if the only son by the first venter failed, the eldest son by the second would succeed, as being in such case the true heir of his body.

Giles Brugge was 30 and Margaret Mattesden 40 years old and upwards, and between them the ancient barony fell into abey ance. I have elsewhere shewn how and when that abeyance ter minated, and that Sir John Brugges, when he received the let ters patent for this new barony limited in its descent to the heirs male of his body, was in reality the sole remaining heir of the original dignity, and in that character entitled to a writ of summons, and to sit in the place of his ancestors, according to the date of the original writ.

I take him to have been the son of Jordan and Beatrice mentioned above, which Beatrix was one of the daughters of Hugh Bardolph and niece and coheir of Robert Lord Bardolph of Hoo in Kent. He was summoned to Parliament three times in the 23rd, and once in the 25th of King Edw.

II. so that he must have been liv ing in a\u00b0. 7 Edw. II. and 30 years of age, yet it does not appear that he was ever summoned to Parliament. His son, who was also named Richard, died in the 19th of Edw. II. m also without having been summoned ; but it is highly probable, ntiy almost certain, that he died a minor, since his death took place within forty-two years of the birth of his father. His two sisters, Mar gery and Margaret, were found to be his heirs; the eldest 12 and the youngest 11 years old : they were then both unmarried, but in the 4th of Edward the Third,\" when Margaret their grand mother died, the eldest was the wife of Hugh de Hastings, a younger son by the second venter of John Lord Bergavenny, and the youngest, Margaret, married to John de Camois. The wardship and marriage of the eldest was purchased of the King for two hundred pounds by the mother of Hastings, at that time wife of Ralph Lord Monthermer ; and Ralph de Camoys, father of John, purchased at the same time and price the wardship and marriage of the youngest. Thus this Barony of Foliot fell into abeyance between Hast ings and Camoys, and a partition of the lands took place upon the death of the grandmother.0 k Rot. Claus. 23 and 25 Edw. I. 1 Esc. 27 Edw.

I proceed therefore with the history of the son. He fled the kingdom, and was outlawed, and all his lands were seized to the King. He had lately married for his second wife a widow richly dowered by two former hus bands, Sir John de Argentine and Sir John de Nerford. She was the daughter and heir of Sir William de Bereford, and ap pears to have stood high in favour with the Queen Consort, for in the year following the King, at the Queen's request, grants to her by the description of Agnes, the wife of John Mautravers, junr. an enemy and rebel, all the lands wherewith she had been dowered by her former husband c John de Argentine, together \u2022 Rot.

Her eldest son, and I believe her only child, John de Argentine, for she certainly had no issue by Nerford or Mautravers,0 was at this time about 13 years old. Her husband remained in banish- ment till 19 Edw. III. when the King going over to Flanders, upon an expectation of having that country put into bis hands by the influence and treachery of its Governor Van Arteveld, found Mautravers there, who appears to have been deeply en- gaged in the plot which cost Arteveld his life and Mautravers all his property, and rendered it no longer safe for him to con- tinue there ; he therefore threw himself upon the King's mercy, who received him graciously, and gave him letters of protection and safe conduct for himself and his retinue until the sentence pronounced against him in a0. 4 should be revised and recon- sidered in the next Parliament.6 These letters, which are ad- dressed to all Sheriffs, Bailiffs, &c. in the several counties, state in the preamble, that John Mautravers le Piere upon the King's arrival in the port of Swyn in Flanders, came to him of his own freewill and surrendered himself, humbly representing to him, that by the laws and custom of England no man could be condemned to death without first being put upon his trial, and having an opportunity to answer for himself, and that in direct violation of the said law and custom, he had been in his absence accused, and, without bearing, adjudged guilty of certain trans- gressions and felonies imputed to him, and remained in banish- ment under that sentence ; that he was desirous to prove his in- nocence, and ready and willing to answer all accusations that could be brought against him in Parliament or elsewhere, and to abide the judgment of the Court ; the King being willing to afford him an opportunity to vindicate his innocence and to an swer all such as might have any charge to bring against him ; and it being absolutely necessary for that purpose, that he should be allowed to return with safety and security into England, and that thereupon proclamation should be made in every county throughout the kingdom, calling upon all persons who had any thing to allege against him in the matters for which he had for merly been condemned, to appear at the ensuing Parliament, d Claus. 49 Edw.

I have bestowed much pains in this search, but am not able to decide. The pedigrees of Willoughby in general make Alice to be a daughter of Skip with ; but that drawn out by Glover does not give her father's name, and he seems to have laboured hard to discover it, but without success. I am inclined to think that the Ralph Ufford, who was father of the Countess of Oxford, was a different person from the Ralph Ufford who married the Countess of Ulster. That there was a Ralph LTfford who had a wife named Elizabeth, appears also clearly from a deed mentioned by Glover,\u00a3 wherein she describes herself Elizabetha de Latymer uxor Radulphi de Ufford; this deed bears date in 39 Edw. III. nineteen years after the death of that Ralph who married the Countess of LJlster. The Pat. 21 Edw.

Now the Inq. p. m. of the Countess of Oxford proves that her mother's name was Eliza beth, and I cannot entertain a doubt of its being the very Eliza beth above mentioned. She calls herself Elizabeth de Latymer wife of Ralph de Ufford, and upon her seal are the aims of Ufford Earl of Suffolk, differenced by a label, impaling the coat of Latymer, and between the words of the circumscription, \" Si gillum Elizabethe Ufford,\" are three shields of the arms of Bote tourt; from which I should think she was a daughter of that William le Latimer who married Botetourt's daughter.1' K Glover's Collections in Coll.

A. f. 22b ; but it would seem, from the evidence adduced in the ensuing note, that this deed must have been quoted erro- neously. \u2014 Edit. h When writing the above, Mr. Townsend overlooked that Dugdale had stated, in p. 48, that Robert de Ufford, son and heir apparent of Robert Earl of Suffolk, and nephew to the Ralph who married the Countess of Ulster, received in 1 1 Edw. III. a pardon for having married Elizabeth, the widow of William le Latimer ; and this has been confirmed by a reference to the original record : \" Pardonavimus dilecto et fideli n'ro Rob'lo de Ufford le Fitz transgressionem quam fecit ducendo in uxorem Elizabetham que suit uxor Will's Latymer defuncti. Test. ap. Westm. xx Aug.\" (Rot. Pat. 11 Edw. III. pars 2, m. 7.) There is therefore no doubt that the husband of Elizabeth, and father of Maud Countess of Oxford, was not any Ralph de Ufford, but that Robert de Ufford, whose name occurs in other records, as well as the foregoing, with the addition of le Fitz, to distinguish him from his father, in whose lifetime lie died ; and she and her sister Alice Willoughby were daughters of John first Lord Botetourt. \u2014 Edit.

This estate, called anciently Benchesham and Bencham, is situate about a mile and a quarter north from the town of Croy don, on the road to Norwood, and comprises 482 acres, 3 roods, 32 perches, of which the allotments made on the inclosure of the waste lands in 1797, form 30 acres, 2 roods, 5 perches. The earliest mention of the manor of Benchesham that has occurred to me, is in the inquest which records the death of Jeffry de Has pale in 1287.a In 1253 Peter Chaceporc had a grant of free warren on his lands in Benchesham.0 At an assize held before the King on the octave of St. Michael, 51 Hen. III. 1267, John Frowyk pleaded that Sir Geoffrey de Frowyk his father was seised on the day of his death in demesne, &c. of one messuage and 300 acres of land, &c. in Northbenchesham and Croydon, which messuage and land Master Hugh and William de Mortimer held. It was agreed that the said John should recognise the land to be Hugh's and William's, and remit all his right and claim to the same, and that Hugh and William should pay to him 10 marks.0 In 15 Edw. I. 1287, William de Mortimer did homage for his lands of .Sharnbrok to John le Moyng' ; and it was believed that he also did homage for Benchesham, but whether to the Archbishop of Canterbury was unknowns In 27 Edw.

There was then a capital messuage of no value beyond reprises; 200 acres of arable land worth 58s. 4c?. per annum, of which one half was valued at 4c?. the other at 3c?. an acre ; the pasture of 8 acres of wood 12c?.; the pan nage, when it happens, communibus annis, 18c?. ; the underwood, 4s. ; 8 acres of meadow land, 8s. ; 20 acres of pasture, 3s. 4c?. ; rents of assize, as well from free tenants as from natives, 70s. ; at Christmas, 24 hens and 1 cock, 4s. ; at the same time, 6 plough shares, 4s. ; pleas and perquisites of courts, 3s. 4c?.

Walter de Chiriton, a merchant, is the next possessor of land here, whose name I meet with. He was one of the farmers of the King's subsidies and customs, and with money borrowed, by pledg ing the crown jewels without licence, had acquired to himself and heirs in fee simple one messuage and one carucate of land, with its appurtenances, in Benchesham, in the parish of Croydon. King Edward III. in consequence, seized his possessions 19 July 1351,*1 and granted this messuage and carucate to John de Wesenham, also a merchant, who passed them to John de Chirbury, and his heirs.'

He died in November 1678, leaving five daughters, Anne, Elizabeth, Mary, Susannah, and Hannah, his heirs, among whom this and the manor of West Court was equally divided. Anne, the eldest coheir, married Robert Callant of Great All hallows, London, merchant, and when his widow conveyed her one fifth, 19 June 1724, to John Borrett, esq. of New House, Shore ham, Kent, sometime Master of the Inner Temple, and one of the Prothonotaries of the Court of Common Pleas. Elizabeth the second married Herbert Price, esq. of Hereford, of whom, and this share, hereafter. Mary the third, by deed recited in will dated 6 Oct. 7 Will. III. (1695) demised her one-fifth to her youngest sister. Of Susannah, the fourth coheir, and her one-fifth, I have no mention. Hannah, the youngest, married Edmund Sheffield, of London, surgeon, and being a widow sold her two-fifths, 5 November 1711, to Thomas Gandy, citizen and paper-stainer of London, who re-sold them, 24 July 1712, to the aforesaid John Borrett, esq.

He died 28 January 1739, when Trevor Borrett, esq. of the Middle Temple, his eldest son and heir, by Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the Right honourable Sir John Trevor, knt. Secretary of State to Charles II. inherited his four-fifths of the manor, and dying in 1776, was succeeded by Thomas Borrett, esq. of New-house, his son and heir, who purchased the remain ing one-fifth of the manor in 1787, and conveyed the whole in 1790 to John Cator, esq. of Beckenham Place, Kent. Elizabeth Price died 15th Feb. 1701-2, and her husband in July 1737. Having obtained a release from his only son, the Rev. John Price, of Panfield, Essex, of his reversion, dated 9 Dec. 1730, he, by will dated 13th July 1737, and proved 9th Aug. following, bequeathed his one-fifth to his two nephews (being sons of his brother Charles) Charles Price, esq. of Presteigne, Rad norshire, and Harvey Price, of Flower-de-luce court, St. Dun stan's in the West, silversmith. Harvey Price, by will dated 14th Sept. 1737, proved 19th January following, bequeathed .' ' share to his brother, who, by will dated 3rd August 1747, proved 22nd Sept. 1750, demised the whole to his wife Jane. Of her fifth I know no more, until it was purchased by Mr. Borrett, as above stated. John Cator, esq. died Feb. 21, 1806, aged 76; when John Cator, esq. his nephew, son of James his brother, and now of Beckenham Place, succeeded to the manor, and in 1828 con veyed it to John Davidson Smith, esq. its present possessor. A piece of copyhold land, called Beulands, and intersecting the estate, was purchased by Mr. Smith of Mr. Pepercorne of Wood ford, Essex, said to be descended from the Mortons. It com prises 25 acres, 26 perches, and pays a quit rent of 6s. 8c?. to the Archbishop of Canterbury. On this and tbe WThitehorse pro perty have been formed the public gardens, called the Beulah Spa. There is no court roll to this manor, and consequently no quit rents are paid to it. The rent now received by the Archbishop is 21. 6s. On the old mansion, which is of red brick, is the date 1604 formed in the brickwork of one of its gables. Roman coins have been found here ; among others, a gold coin of Domitian, Lucius \u00c6lius, Valentinian, and Titus Vespa sian, all in fine preservation."], [184, "168 ACCOUNT OF THE MANOR OF CROHAM. This manor, spelt formerly also Croweham, Crouham, and Crauham, comprising, by estimation, 350 acres of arable and wood land, (of which about 3 acres were allotted under the in closure act,) is situated about a mile south-east of the town of Croydon. Its earliest mention as a manor occurs in the inquest upon the death of Jeffrey de Haspale, taken in 15 Edward I. (1286). On 25th November, 41 Edward III. (1368), Thomas, son and heir of Walter de Chiriton, released to John de Burgh, John de Hameldon, vicar of Croydon, and John the son of Robert Oliver of Croydon, all his lands and tenements in Crauham, which they held of him.* By the fine roll 46 Edw. III. (1373), m. 27, we learn that the manor of Crouham was, for certain causes which are not set out, seized into the King's hands, and the custody thereof leased to Nicholas Carrew, for twenty years, at the annual rent of 40s. which lease in 16 Richard II. (1393), was renewed to Nicholas Carew the son for a term of ten years at the same rent, raised afterwards to 10s.b On the 17th Oct. 1 Hen. IV. ( 1399), the custody of the manor was granted by the Crown to William Olyver at the rent of 40s. per annum;0 and on 2nd July following to William Olyver and John Southcote, at the rent of 50s. per annum.-1 In the 14th of this reign (1409), William Olyver and others were discharged of the rent of 60s. per annum, which they paid for its custody ,e The next possessor of the manor I meet with is John Elme ruggeor Elenbrugge, esq.M.P.for the county 29 Hen.

De Lega Prioris, &c.) or, as called by Dugdale (Mon. vol. vi. p. 388), \" Leiis Ay- nulfi,\" in which charter he desires that his body be buried in the before-mentioned place of St. Leonard, if he should happen to die in England ; (\" volo q\u00b0 vt corpus meu' in p'd'co loco sc'i Leonardi sepeliatur si me in Anglia mori contig'it\") and that he most probably is the individual represented on the monument. He died 8 Rich. 1. (U9G-7). * Son of Gilbert de Lacy ; he was governor of Dublin and Justice of Ireland, temp. Hen.

ON THE DESCENT OF THE MANOR OF GORHAMBURY IN HERT- FORDSHIRE, AND OF THE ANGLO-BRETON FAMILY FROM WHOM THAT ESTATE DERIVED ITS NAME. The manor of which it is proposed to give an account in the course of the following pages, was known by the name of West *wiCKa from the earliest record till Century xiv, by that of WESTWicK-GoRHAMb during Century xv, and by that of Gorhamburyc from about the period of the dissolution of monasteries to the present day. The family from whom its existing name was derived, became its possessors about the close of the reign of Henry I. ; they came into England, from Bri tanny, shortly before that period, being descended from distin guished ancestors settled in the province of Maine.d [I.] De Gorram, of La Tanniere, in the Maine. The de Gorrams can be traced, in Britanny, to the beginning of Century xii. Their castle was situated on a small rivulet called the Futaye, at la Tanniere, seven miles west from the town of Gorram e (from which place doubtless the family name origi nated), and twenty miles n.w. from Mayenne. The name is vari ously spelt, Gorram (the most antient mode), Goram, Gorran, Goran, Gorren and Goron ; its English orthography has, * Matt. Paris, Vita Abb. Sci. Albani, pp. 53 et seq., edit.

St. Alban's, p. 53) ; Clutterbuck has adopted this mistake. (Hist. Herts, i. 88.) c The castle of Gorram (now called Goron) was granted in 1135 by Geoffrey Plantagenet to Juhel II. Lord of Mayenne, on condition that he would assist him in obtaining possession of the dower of his wife Matilda (Robert de Monte, Append. in Sigebert. Chronic, in Op. Guiberti Abbatis, p. 758. Paris. 1651); Gorren Castle was regranted to Juhel III. de Mayenne in 1199 by Arthur Duke of Britanny. (Menage, Hist, de Sabli?, p. 186).

In 1161 he confirmed and extended the grants of his father (c). About 1175 he gave to the monks of Savigny some land near Ernee, called Lamehellee, and also lands in Doree and Livard, for_the work of the new Abbey just com menced, and (after the completion of the edifice) for a pittance in the refectory of bread, wine, and fish (d, g).

This family has not been traced further ; but there is no doubt that Nicholas de Gorram, the celebrated author of Commentaries on several parts of the New Testament, was of the Maine, and that he was not an Englishman, as asserted by Leland and Tanner. Moreri asserts that this appears from seve ral MSS. of his works, written in his own time, and preserved before the Revolution in the Library of the Sorbonne.P He was Confessor of Philip le Bel, son of Philip le Hardi, King of France; and died about 1295. [II. ] De Gorham, of Gorhambury, Hertfordshire. 1. At the end of Century xi, or very early in Century xn, Geoffrey de Gorham came from the Maine (at the invitation of Richard de Albini, a Norman, 15th Abbot of St. Alban's), to take charge of the school attached to that religious house; he was then a layman, and not arriving promptly, the place was filled by another. He read lectures for a time at Dunstable ; he afterwards became a monk at St. Alban's, and was elected the 16th Abbot in 1120 ;i probably having been influentially recom mended to the brethren, as a fit person for that office, by his Norman patron and predecessor. There had been great dissen sions in that Abbey, between the English and French monks, from 1093 to 1097; the latter, proving the stronger party, began to bestow their preferment, upon foreigners : this circumstance induced Geoffrey de Gorham to emigrate from Britanny, and also brought several of his relatives r to England to profit (as we shall hereafter see) by his advancement. Matthew Paris, (who was himself a monk of St. Alban's a century later, and who gives a very prolix account of the acts of Abbot Geoffrey), severely censures his propensity to promote the interests of his relations to the prejudice of the convent. It is particularly stated, that he \"built a Hall at Westwick for the use of a cer tain friend and relation ofhis who had been a benefactor to the ' Moreri, Grand Diction, v. 286. Paris, 1759. i Matt. Paris, Vita Abb. Sci.

Church.\" This Hall was, undoubtedly, the Manor House s of Westwick-Gorham, or Gorhambury; and the relation alluded to was his brother-in-law, Hugh, the son of Humbald, to whom Abbot Geoffrey de Gorham gave his own sister in marriage, to gether with \" the whole estate of Westwick,\" though of right it \" was appropriated to the monk's Refectory.\" This manor be longed to the Saxon Kings, and was granted to St. Alban's by E'.helred in the time of Abbot Alfric1 (his Chancellor) about A.D. 990. About 1080 it was leased for his life to Humbald, by Abbot Paul, at the request of his relation Archbishop Lan franc, on the express condition that he should not alienate it. u Notwithstanding this restriction, Abbot Geoffrey de Gorham, without the consent of his Convent, granted this manor in per petuity to Hugh, the son of Humbald, as his sister's marriage portion, about the year 1130. Geoffrey de Gorham died in 1146. 2. The manor of Westwick seems to have devolved, about this period, upon Ive de Gorham ;t it may be conjectured that he was the nearest heir of the Abbot's sister, her marriage with Hugh Fitz-Humbald having probably failed of issue. He had a fresh grant w of this estate from Geoffrey de Gorham, confirm atory of his title by inheritance. \u2022 It was still remaining at the dissolution. The notion that this ancient manor house was built as a summer retreat for the Abbots of St. Alban's, is apocryphal, and contradicted by the express assertion of Matthew Paris, cited in the text. Newcome, with his usual inaccuracy, states that it was built by Robert de Gorham, the 18th Abbot, for his own residence. \u2022 MSS. Corp. Chr. Coll Camb. vii. f. 231.

Robert de Gorham, nephew of Abbot Geoffrey, was a monk abroad ; probably at Savigny, that house being patronised by his family. x Having obtained permission of the Abbot, un der whose rule he lived, to visit his uncle, he was so delighted with the establishment at St. Alban's, that he expressed a strong desire to become a monk there ; a wish which his uncle did not gratify, till he had returned to France, and had obtained letters demissory from the Foreign Convent, which he accomplished with difficulty. He became Secretary of the Abbey ; he was made the Prior in 1148; and was elected the 18th Abbot in 1151. He died in 1166, and was buried in the Chapter-house, at the foot of the grave of Abbot Paul. His godfather, Henry de Gorham, occurs about 1160, as a person of influence in the affairs of the Abbey. ? Geoffrey, and Robert de Gorham, brothers, and both monks of St. Alban's, were sent, about 1 161, to Rome, with a present, from their relative the Abbot, to Pope Adrian, of two candelabra exquisitely wrought in silver and gold.2 The conventual acts of Abbot Robert are recorded a with honour, and at great length ; but several exceptionable deeds are also stated with strong reprobation. He was as little scrupulous as his uncle in bestowing the possessions of the Abbey on his rela tives from Britanny. He gave the estate at Sarret to his brother Ralph de Gorham, b without the concurrence of the fraternity. with the addition of the name of the patronised relative, \" Ive de Gorham\" (MS.

That the passage was obtruded by some officious interpolator, after the time of Matthew Paris, appears also from its incoherence with the clause immediately preceding, aud from the expression \" ignobile genus,\" so directly opposed to the \" illustris progenies \" which the original author assigns to this family (see note d above). The gloss, cleared of its blunders, was probably derived from a fact, viz. that Ive de Gorham held the estate of Westwick by a grant of confirmation from his relative Abbot Geoffrey. * See the list of the Gorham Charters, note ' above. y Matt.

The Countess repented of her rashness, and, being ab solved from her vow by the Pope, married Simon Earl of Lei cester in 1238 ; but Cecilia de Gorham maintained her purpose to the end of her life. When she was dying, her confessor di rected her female attendant to remove from her finger her wed ding ring, as a remnant of worldly vanity ; but Cecilia resisted the attempt, observing that she had betrothed herself to God, in whose presence she was resolved to appear with this token of her espousals. She died 23rd July 1251, universally regretted, and was buried with much honour at St. Alban's in front of the altar of St. Andrew.

The estate of Westwick thus passed out of the Gorham family, which appears to have become extinct, in Hertfordshire, in the early part of Century xiv, as no further trace of it is to be found in that county. The manor of Westwick-Gorham descended from Alphonsus de Veer to his son John 7th Earl of Oxford, who, in 1350, granted it to his son Thomas de Veer (afterwards 8th Earl of Oxford) and Matilda his wife, with entail upon their heirs male.* Earl Thomas having died in 1371, and the heir male in expect ancy, Robert Duke of Ireland, 9th Earl of Oxford, having been attainted in 1388, the reversion of this manor escheated to the Crown. This circumstance afforded the monks of St. Alban's an opportunity of repurchasing an estate, the iniquitous aliena tion of which by Abbot Geoffrey had always been considered as a great misfortune.

Gorhambury continued with the Abbey of St. Alban's till the dissolution, from which period it is unnecessary to trace its de scent with any detail, as it has been recorded with sufficient minuteness in the topographical histories of Hertfordshire. It was granted by Henry VIII. to Ralph Rowlatt, esq. From him it passed to Sir Nicholas Bacon; who, in 1563, pulled down the antient Hall, built in the early part of Century xn by Abbot Geoffrey de Gorham, of which \" the foundations \" are said2 to be still \" discernible in the present park, situate eastward of the new mansion [completed in 1568], and near the row of chesnut trees celebrated in Evelyn's time.\" Queen Elizabeth visited Sir Nicholas, in his new mansion at Gorhambury, in 1577.a This estate and mansion were sold to Sir Harbottle Grimston in 1652 : it is now the property and residence of the Earl of Verulam. y Fin.

There is still remaining in St. Dunstan's Church a tablet to the memory of Sir Matthew Carew, containing a very circumstantial inscription in Latin ; of which the few first words only have been published in the Histories of London, and though it has been printed among Mr. DenTiam's copies of the epitaphs, yet, as it is there obscured by several inaccuracies, and as several others have been since committed on the original in regilding the letters, but chiefly because it is a very curious composition, both in respect to genealogy and auto-biography, I have thought proper to introduce it at length : \"D.

Harl. 1196, f. 152, is still preserved Sir Matthew Carew's first draft of this inscrip- tion, evidently in his own hand. Its introductory lines leave no doubt of the authorship *: \"D . O .M Memorise Posterisq' \" Felice chi puo.

Mea propria manu mihi herede costitui. Sim charus (S[C. as above.) \" Patria Cornubiensis, &c. There are numberless variations, and indeed the whole was remodelled. His school education is mentioned : \" libere schola Westmonasteriesi sub p'ceptore Noello \u2014 ; \" but the substance of the rest is transferred into the present epi- taph. Some lines of Latin poetry are added ; and on the same paper are sketches of the Carew pedigree, also written by Sir Matthew. With respect to the account which the epitaph gives of the distribution of the seventeen manors by Lady Carew among her several sons, it is remarkable that it is related nearly in the same terms in the \" Survey of Cornwall,\" by Richard Carew, of Antony, in that county, the nephew of Sir Matthew ; except that the historian ascribes the proceeding to the mother having taken offence with the eldest son. It is further remarkable that the epitaph of Richard Carew himself, in the church of Antony, which, in its style and in its biographical minuteness, much resembles that of Sir Matthew, has also shared a similar fate, of remaining unpub- lished, whilst a fragment of it was repeatedly printed instead of the whole. The circumstances were curious : the learned Camden was solicited to supply the epitaph, as appears from his Epistol\u00e6, p. 106 ; but Richard Carew, Esq. the son of the deceased, appears to have preferred a more circumstantial composition, at the same time that he retained several of Camden's expressions. Hugh C , who wrote the Life of the Historian, prefixed to the \" Survey of Cornwall.\" quoted the epitaph, not from the monument, but from Camden's Epistol\u00e6 ; and he was followed by Polwhele in his History of the county, and by Lysons in his Magna Britannia, under the impression that it was the actual inscription on the tomb ; nor was the deficiency supplied in the handsome reprint of Carew's Survey by Lord de Dunstanville, 4to. 1811.

It appears from the returns known as Pope Nicholas's Taxation, that the rectory of Kirkaudrew's near Carlisle, or Kirkaudrew's-upon-Eden, had not been anciently taxed, as not exceeding four marks, but in 1292 the portion of the Prioress of Marigg was taxed at three pounds. In"], [253, "HARMBY. NEWTON-IN-LE-WILLOWS. 237 1319, 12 Edw. II. the portion of the Prioress was not taxed, because the church was destroyed. In 1361 the Prioress and convent of Marrig, or Maryke, presented Sir John de Bempton to this church, who was thereupon instituted by Bishop Welton.

Ad., a certain tenement called Berepark, with two other tenements and a cottage, and the land appurtenant thereto in Car perby, late in the tenure of Elizabeth late wife of Roger Metcalfe, at 51. 18s. 3d., were likewise included in the lease to Uvedale \u25a0 but the timber upon the estate and the advowson of the vicarage of Mar rick were reserved. Uvedale had been one of the commissioners for the suppression of monasteries in the north parts, his name being appended with that of Leonard Beckwith to the schedule of pensions assigned to the prioress and nuns of Marrick at the time of the dissolution. Among the evi dences is a copy of a letter from Sir Richard Rich, the Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, to the Lord President of the King's Council in the North parts, dated 17 Jan. 31 Hen. VIII. signifying that the King was minded to give to \" Maister Uvedale, his graces servant,\" the lease of the house and demesnes of Marrick for twenty-one years, but that he the said Sir Richard had been advised that the chief and most profitable things thereof had been devised to Sir Rauf Bulmer, knt. \" sithens the compaste of the acte ;\" he therefore requires the Presi dent to make inquiry upon oath as to the time of making and sealing of any late and suspect leases to Sir Rauf and others, \" and the rather for my sake,\" concludes the writer, \" I righte hertelye beseeche you to shew your good expedic'on herein for the spedye dispache of my said loving frende.\" In consequence of this request, an inquiry was held at York on the 27th January following, when Dame Anne Bulmer, wife to Sir Ralph, of the age of thirty-four years, and Dame Cristobell Cowper, late prioress of Marrick, of the age of forty-five years, were examined, as also Christopher Thornaby of Marrick, gent. Thomas Helmsley and Christopher Slinger, servants to Sir Ralph and the prioress, and others. From their depositions it appears that three leases had been made to Sir Ralph and Dame Anne his wife,' (one of the parsonage aud glebe of Marrick, another ofa farm called Ullands, and the third of certain lauds, inter alia, a piece called Oxskue, lying in the fields of Marrick,) but not sealed until the first Sunday in Lent last past, and that they had never been accustomably letten until May-day next after the commotion, which was in the 29th year of the King's reign. Leases of the Spittel upon Stainmore, of lands in Downholme, of the ninth sheaf in Aiskew, and of the tythes and barn at Carkin were produced, bearing date respec tively the 1st and 30th of April, the 1 7th and 2/tli of August of the above regnal year.and also of a tenement usually held in demesne,calledBearpark in Carperby, but it was said that the prioress claimed a forfeiture thereof by Roger Metcalf, the late tenant. The result of the investigation was the avoidance of these several deeds ; and a particular of the lease to Uvedale having been drawn up by the Chancellor, lie was by his com-"], [257, "241 FAMILY OF L VEDALE. mandment put in possession, as fermor of the demesnes of Marrick priory, by Leonard Beckwith, 25 March, 32 Hen. VIII. 1541, though no formal lease was delivered until the 6th June 1542. In the interim Christopher Maunsell and Reynald Alderson had obtained a separate lease of the Spital on Staynemore, which, at the suit of Uvedale, was avoided by a decree of the President and Council of the North, to which he was at that time chief secretary ( 1 2 Feb. 34 Hen. VIII.), directing them to abide by what was ordered in the Court of Augmentations. By virtue of a warrant, signed by Sir Edward North, knt. Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, bearing date 22d January, 36 Hen. VIII. 1545, a further particular of the site and demesnes of Marrick priory was made out by Richard Hutchinson, one of the auditors of the Court, with a view to the sale of the reversion in fee of the premises on lease, which by letters patent bearing date 8 June, 37 Hen. VIII. 1546, were (with the exception of Bearpark and the other tenements in Carperby, already disposed of) granted to the then lessee, John Uvedale, esq. one of the King's Council in the North, his heirs and assigns for ever, in consideration of the sum of 364/. Os. 6<i. The advowson and right of presentation to the church of Marrick was included in the grant, together with all liberties and rovalties, excepting mines of lead \u2022 the reserved annual rent was set at 36s. 10rf. to be paid at Michaelmas, and the tennre in capite at the twentieth part of a knight's fee - a yearly stipend of four pounds was also made payable out of the rectory to the curate of Marrick. Concerning the family of Uvedale, who thus became the owners of Marrick priory, and which they continued to occupy as a seat for two generations, I find this notice in manuscript among the evidences : '\u2022 In an olde a roll of armes in parchem1 fownde in Croxton abbaie in the Cowntie of Leicester, it apperithe that Mounser duuedale givethe a crosse like a mill-pike redde in a fielde of silver\" (and this was the olde armes oonelie of the L'uedale) for duuedale is no more but as moche to saie de Uuedale, and then for shortenes and curiositie of speache the first vowel -e- is elidide bi apostrophe, wch is a figure that when two vowels do coihe together the first is lost and drownide in to the last, and soo Mounser de Uuedale is callede shorte Mounser Duuedale. this * Mont' de douuedale port d' Argent a une croiz recercele de gouT is written iu the margin.

But, notwithstanding the conference here reported, the connection of Uvedale of Marrick with the knightly family of Uvedale, long seated at Titsey in Surrey, and Wickham in Hampshire, is more than doubtful. The only document that I have met with which illustrates their real descent, is the will of Juliana Skoore, of the parish of Banwell, in the county of Somerset, dated 5 Feb. 1542. After bequeathing her soul to God, and her body to be buried in the parish church of Banwell, and giving to the high altar for tythes forgotten xud , to the mother church of St. Andrew of Wells mirf., to the churchhouse ii plattors & ii pot tyngrs to be occupyde only at the church ale, and divers kyrtles and householde effects to her godechildren and others, she leaves all the rest of her goods, moveable aud unmovable, to George Woodall, the sonne of Thomas Woodall, and makes him her sole executor, concluding thus : \" I wyll yt my sonne John Uuedale, one of the Kyng our sov'ayn lordes Councell in the north p'ties, shall have the ordyr, rule & gov'nunce off the sayd George Woodale, & ov' all suche thyngs as I have gyve' and beqetfiyd the saide George duryng the tyme of hys nonage, and also I History of Essex, vol. i. p. 56. Some original notes of the statements of this William, concerning the family of Uvedale, and the traditions preserved respecting them, are among the evidences ; but the paper on which they are written has suf- fered greatly from age ; this much, however, may yet be decyphered : \"William Woddall of Chinkeforde, in the cowntye of [Essex] (sonne and heire of John Wod- dall of Woddehall in [Deane] in the cownty of Comberland), saith that his name [is Uue]dale, for he saith that the parishe chirche of Woddehall, where all his an- ceters were buried, the same chirche was fowndide by his anceters, who have sette the crosse Uuedale doth give in a certeine stoone in the chawncel, but the names graven upon the tombe stoones of his [anceters] appeare manifestelie to be Woode- hall and not Uuedale ; that name of Woddehall his said father did revert to [bicawse] of murder brought against him in the King's bench [in the] xxvn0 [yere] of King Henry the eight for beating Curwen [a n]eighber in Com [berlande] .

In the 26 Hen. VIII. John Uvedale filled the post of secretary to the Queen, he being so styled in a grant to him in that year of the suppressed hospital of Newton Garth, in the county of York. I also find the following memorandum of a somewhat singular feofment made to him of the reversion of the estates of Croft and Walmyre in Richmondshire, the patrimony of the knightly family of Clervaux. \" Md. that abowt the xxxnite yeare of King Henry the eight, John Clerveax of Crofte in the cowntye of Yorke esquier didde make a fefm1 to John Uvedale of Marrigge in the saide cowntye esquier of the manos of Crofte & Walmyre in the said Cowntye and signede and sealede the same fefm1 & delivered it as his deede to the saide John Uvedale at Yorke in the howse of oone Stephen Brampton in the presence of the same Stephen Branip ton & oone Edwarde Reddeshawe.

He appoints his son sole executor, or in case of his de cease Sir Nicholas Benne, his servant, George Uvedale, Thomas Bright man, and others. On the following day (25 Oct. 1546) he had license to alienate to Richard Geflfreyson the meadow at Downeham of five acres, and the common of pasture, which had belonged to Marrick priory \u2022 but he was dead before 2 March 1549, on which day his will was proved by his son and executor Alvered or Avery Uvedale. Of Alvered Uvedale I find these notices. In 1540 he obtained a spiritual indulgence from Robert, minister of the House of St. Robert, of the order of tlie Redemption of Captives at Knaresborougli ; in 1549 he succeeded his father in the estate at Marrick, of which he had livery on the 22d of November in the following year (4 Edw. VI. 1550). In the 6 Edw. VI. (12 Aug. 1552) he signed a deed for the exchange of cer tain lands in Marrick, the other party being John Saire of Worshall, in the county of York, esq. and Dorothy his wife, and Sir Rauf Bulmer the elder, knight, c who were then the possessors of the manor and de mesne lands which had remained to the family of Aske.

Phillip is written, and a curse is denounced against him and all his kin. They seem to afford corroborative testimony of the truth of the character here drawn of him by Uvedale, as we may suppose them cast by some hapless victim of his wiles and extortion, to soothe his misery in the fancied hope of being able to call down upon his head a day of retribution. What was the sequel of Avery Uvedale's bill of complaint does not appear. In the 1 2th of Elizabeth he had a further lease of tbe rectory, together with the advowson of the vicarage of Grin ton, and of the tenement called Cogden, likewise parcel of the estate formerly belonging to the Priory of Bridlington in the parish, which tenement he in the same year (24 Oct. 1570) underlet to Thomas Lord Wharton for twenty-one years. In 1575 (7 Feb. 17 Eliz.) a third lease was obtained (but with the reservation of the timber, mines, and ad vowson of the vicarage), which Avery Uvedale assigned over to James Pepper and Richard Willans, 8th April, 20 Eliz. 1578. I also find that Averye Uvedale, esq. was, together with Sir George Bowes, knt. and Robert Bowes, esq. one of the justices of peace for the wapentakes of Gilling East and Gilling West, in Richmondshire, according to the divi sion made 1 2th Aug. 13 Elizabeth ; Sir Christopher Metcalf and John Sayer, esq. being appointed for those of Hang East and Hang West, and William Tankard and Michael Wandisforth, esquires, for Halikeld.

John Uvedale had livery of his father's lands 24 May, 27 Eliz. 1585 ; but not long afterward (18 Dec. 1588, 31 Eliz.) he joined with his bro ther Thomas iu the sale of the estate at Marrick with the rectory and advowson of the vicarage, and the tithes at Aiskew and Carkin, to Richard Brackenbury, of London, esq. for the sum of 200 marks, and subsequently (22 March 1589) Anne, the widow of Averye Uvedale, released to the purchaser all claim she might have had in right of dower. She was living at Helmsley in 1592, and apparently in distress, as she in that year petitioned the then possessors of Marrick to aid her, by reason of the losses she had sustained in removing her goods from Mar rick ; but of her sons I have been unable to discover any traces after they had parted with their patrimony in Richmondshire."], [269, "DESCENT OF MARRICK ABBEY ESTATE. 253 PEDIGREE OF UVEDALE OF MARRICK ABBEY.

By Eliza beth . his first wife, he had issue, John, Gyles, Robert, Anthony, Timothy, Ellinor, and Anne. In 1634 (14 June) he and Elizabeth his wife made a grant of their tithes of lead in Marrick to William Bulmer, of Marrick, esq. with warranty against John and Gyles, the sons of the said Robert and Elizabeth, in consideration of 750/. In 1649 (18 March) a common recovery was suffered to enable Robert Blackburne and his sons to hold each his third part in severalty, but no actual partition was made. By his second wife lie left James, Francis, and other children ; and dying intestate 18th Aug. 1651, his third part of the Marrick-abbey estate descended to John his eldest son and heir, who died without issue in 1661. Upon his decease the estate at Marrick was again united in the possession of Giles Blackburne, who survived his brother eight years. During his occupancy (24 June 1664) the barn and tithes of Carkin were sold for 120/. to John Johnson, of Newsam, in the county of York, yeoman, and divers lands and tenements in Marrick to Thomas Buckton, of Snasay, yeoman, and to his son Thomas, for the sum of 360/.

John Blackburne was under age at the time of his father's death ; in 1678, upon attaining his majority, he levied a fine of the estate at Marrick to William Wyvell, of Constable-Burton, esq. upon trust, but no uses were declared ; for, subsequently becoming involved, he was necessitated to raise money by successive mortgages upon the property, and finally to sell it. In right of his wife Frances, by whom he had two sons, John and Malham, he succeeded in establishing his title to the estate of Friar-head in the parish of Gargrave in Craven, which had belonged to Col.

In the preceding division of this article the name of the parish, in which St. Andrew's priory was situate, is written Marrigg ; but Marrick is the now accepted form of spelling the word, and I have therefore substituted it for Marrigg in the heading to the present part. In both places of the Domesday survey of the lands of Earl Alan in Yorkshire, the printed copy has Mange as the name of the parish, which we may correct by the extract in the Registrum Honoris de Richeinond into Marige. Iu the evidences Marrig and Marrigg con stantly occur ; a single deed has Marrega, and the other variations Marig, Marric, Marie, Marrik, Marrike, and Marrick are occasionally met with. Leland, in enumerating the abbies and priories on Suale (Itin. vol. v. f. 115), writes \" Marik, a priory of Blake nnnnes of the foundation of the Askes. It stondith ripa ulter. Syr Rase Bowmer hath a place at Marick Town standing on a hill-side half a mile from the Priori, stonding in a Botom.\" In the returns of the time of Hen. VIII. it is spelt Marryk and Marryke. Burton heads his account in the Monasticon Eboracense \"Maryke or Marige priory,\" and Whit aker, in his Richmondshire, has both Marrick and Marrigg as the modern names of the parish. Having very recently visited the site of Marrick Priory, I learned that the demolition of the old conventual church took place in 1811, the chief incentive to this wanton act of Vandalism being the expectation of realizing a considerable sum from the sale of the lead which covered the roof. To judge from the mouldings of the yet remaining arches in the ruined chancel and from the tracery of the windows, which have been transferred from the old to the new building, I am inclined to think that Dr. Wliitaker has somewhat underrated the antiquity of the former edi fice, and that it was at least of as early a date as the reigns of the Ed wards. The large window at the west end opening into the bell-house of the old steeple, and which is simply divided into three lights, is cer tainly of this date, and with it the dripstones or weather mouldings of the"], [275, ""], [276, "Ctr7Z&o\u00a3, A7/; et (,'ert<U'l"], [277, "259 SITE OF MARRICK PRIORY. other arched openings strictly correspond. The square-headed windows, which appear in the engraving of the church in the History of Rich mondshire, are probably the work of the 15th century ; and that now used for the east window, which has apparently been taken from the chantry of the Askes at the east end of the old north aisle, has the arch depressed in the Tudor style. A large slab, now let into the pavement near the north door, from which the brasses of a knight and his ladv, and four shields of arms, have been reaved, was also doubtless once a sepulchral memorial in this chapel of the Founder. Of the conventual buildings, the hall and kitchen, each with their spacious chimney, the passage between, and the ruined walls of the parlour beyond, are, with the Prioress's chambers joining on to the steeple on the north side, all that now exist according with the ground-plan. Plain square windows, crossed by transoms, indicate the chambers to be an erection of late date. At the time they were built, an upper story was also added to the stee ple, probably a few years prior to the suppression. Inserted in the wall of the cemetery, is a block of stone on which are carved two shields, viz. a saltier and an engrailed cross ; and the font is ornamented with plain shields in hollowed recesses, in the form usual in fonts of the 15 th century. Tbe site of the priory now belongs to James Berkeley luce, esq. of Gray's Inn, whose ancestor of the name of Piggott,m a native of Marrick, having raised himself to affluence, purchased from the Blackburnes this last remnant of their property. The original documents from which this article has been formed, are now in the possession of Martin Farquhar Tupper,n Esq. of Lincoln's Inn, who is maternally descended from one of the former possessors of the priory and lands of Marrick.o T. S. \u25a0 James Piggott Ince, esq. was the late owner of the property. \" Not W. C.

This name must have been entered by mistake instead of the first William born to Charles and Elizabeth Seymour.

Thus Bekard and Pickering appear to be the right heirs of the origi nal Barony of Greystoke. But the land and the title were both enjoyed by the issue of Ralph Fitzwilliam.

The first of this family who was summoned to Parliament was Ralph de Dacre, and not William, as Dugdale states, and to whom he mistakingly ascribes writs from 28 Edw. I. to 12 Edw. II. no such writs being upon record. This Ralph, some years before he was called to Parliament, had contrived to carry off by night the rich heiress of the Barony of Gillesland, then a ward of the King's, and residing in Warwick castle. Her name was Margaret, and she was the only child of Thomas de Multon, who had been summoned by the title of Thomas de Multon de Gillesland, who died in a0. 7 Edw.

This William Lord Dacre married Joan daughter of James Earl Douglas of Scotland, and had issue Thomas Lord Dacre, and having been regularly summoned from 7 to 22 Ric. II. died the 20th of June in that year, leaving the said Thomas his son only 12 years of age. It is remarkable that writs of summons appear to have been directed to this William with great regu larity to every Parliament from 22 Ric. II. the year ofhis death, to the 5th of Hen. IV. inclusive. Thomas Lord Dacre, son of the said William, coming of age in a\u00b0. 10 Hen.

But the honour thus conferred upon the Lord Ralph he did not long enjoy, being amongst the number of those slain on the Lancastrian side at the battle of Towton, which decided the fate of that party, and raised the house of York to the throne.

Although he was also included in the general Act of attainder, yet he soon found means to reconcile himself to the new government, and was ad mitted to the grace and favour of King Edward at his palace of Westminster in the 2d year of his reign.1 It was certainly not this Humfrey who, by the title of Dacre, swore fealty to Prince Edward in a0. 11 Edw.

The award of King Edward IV. in a\u00b0. 13, did certainly entail the Barony of Dacre of Gillesland, with advice of the Judges in Parliament, upon the heirs male of the body of Thomas Lord Dacre, who died a0. 37 Hen. VI. George, the young Lord, inherited the dignity as heir male, and upon his death without issue, Leonard became heir male, and in that character rightfully assumed the title of Lord Dacre of Gillesland; but, upon suing out his livery by that title, he was opposed by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal, as guardian of the three sisters of Lord George, on whom the Duke alleged the said dignity to have devolved as heirs general of their brother and of the said Lord Thomas, and to whom the Lords Commis sioners, who were appointed to decide the question, did in the end adjudge it. As far as can be gathered from their report the award was not produced before them. If so, the 4efect must be ascribed either to the ignorance or negligence of Leonard's solicitors. At present tbe error is not very material, because time has removed all possible competitors ; but the immediate consequence proved fatal to one of the parties and fruitless to the other. Leonard was driven into rebellion, exile, and a prema ture death ; and the ladies, except the nominal victory, gained nothing that either of them could enjoy, for the honour being indivisible fell into abeyance amongst them and their issue, and remains so to this hour : it may be truly said, they robbed him of that which not enriched them, but made him poor indeed. Of these three sisters two only, Anne and Elizabeth, left issue; that of the former will appear under the title of Howard Duke of Norfolk, and thatof the latter under Howard Earl ofCarlisle. They carried with them, besides this dignity (thus obtained), the entire Baronies of Fitzwilliam and Greystoke, a moiety of those of Bulbec and Wemme ; a fourth of the Barony of Montfichet, and a third of a moiety of that of Merley or Morpeth, all of which were brought into the family of Dacre subsequent to the award of Edward the Fourth, and were consequently not affected by it.

Thomas de Gorham, probably grandson of the preceding, was the last male descendant of that branch of his family which was established in Lincolnshire. Margaret de Gorham, his sole daughter and heiress, married Sir John Littlebury,0. knight, about the yearr 1400; her arms1 were Gules, 3 shackbolts con joined in fess point Or. By this marriage the Littleburys be came possessed of the manor called Gorham' s r, which was un doubtedly one of the Whaplode manors belonging to her an cestor Margery de Gorham, although it has not been identified with any of the lordshipss at present existing in that place: this i The Littleburys were of Tid St. Giles' and of Holbeach, in the reign of Hen. III. ; and of Stainby about 1460, by the marriage of Humfrey Littlebury, esq. with Margaret Davison, heiress of that property. Their pedigree, from Sir Martin Littlebury, Chief Justice of England, temp. Hen. III. to Humfrey Little- bury, esq. of Stainby about 1590, may be seen in MSS. Harl. 1550, ff. IS b, 16.

Harl. 1190, f. 78. 1 There are six manors in Whaplode. (1.) Abbot's, formerly belonging to Croy- land Abbey ; in 1812 it was the property of Lord Eaudley ; it is now possessed by Mr. Edwards, solicitor, of Spalding. (2.) Aswick ,- This seems to have been for- merly in possession of the Fitzwalters. (Papers of the Duke of Somerset.) It may therefore be conjectured that it was one of the manors in Whaplode of which John de Multon of Egremond died seised in 1334 : Joanna, his daughter and heiress, wife of Robert Fitzwalter, died seised of it in 1363. (Esch. 37 Edw. III. n. 26.) Aswick (Fitzwalter's) belonged to Sir Roger Manners, and about 1650 was sold by John Manners, afterwards Duke of Rutland, to Sir Thomas Dawes ; in 1689 it was transferred to Mr. Andrew Bonnel merchant of London, from whose descendants it passed by inheritance on the maternal side to the Duke of Somerset, the present owner. (3.) Hagbeach; in the reign of Edw. II. it was held by Adam de Hake- beche, and in 1320 was (with its appurtenances in Holbeach, Spalding, and Mul- ton) the dowry of Agnes his widow, by whom it passed, through a second marriage, to John Pelryn in 1323 (Plac. de Banco Hil. 13 Edw. II. m. 56, 16 Edw. II. m. 99, and 17 Edw. II. m. 73) ; another moiety descended to Robert son of Adam de Hakebeche.who, in 1319, contended it against Richard le Skynner. (Plac. de Banco Pasch. 12 Edw. II. m. 21.) In 1527 Gilbert Pinchbeck died seised of the manor of Whaplode Hakebeche hall, in Whaplode and Holbeach ; he was succeeded by Richard his son and heir, then ten years old. (Inq. post mortem, 19 Hen. VIII.) About the middle of the last century it was the property of Sir John Elwell ; from whom it descended to the present Sir William H. Fremantle, Bart, by marriage. (4.) Kirk-fee, the property of the late Rev. Maurice Johnson. (5.) Knevet's; in 1554-5 Joanna Knyvet, widow, passed the manor of Whaplode to William Knyvet, gentleman (Fin. Line. 2 Phil. & Mar. Mich.) ; in 1596, Henry Pratt, gentleman, of Weldon in Northamptonshire, died seised of it (Inq. post mortem, 38 Eliz.) ; and was succeeded by his sou Anthony Pratt, then 29 years old ; it was still in that family in 1692, but passed by marriage about 1703 to Charles Howson, Esq; whose family possessed it till 1805, when it was sold to Thomas Foster, Esq. who"], [360, "342 FAMILY OF DE GORHAM, OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. appears to have been the same manor which, in 1468, was alien ated l by Sir Robert Littlebury, knight, to Robert Tanfeld, senior, esquire, and Thomas Hoo, gentleman, of Abbot's Wal den, Hertfordshire. A few traces of the antient possessions of the Gorham family still exist in Whaplode. In a terrier dated 1662, \"Gorham's Place\" is indicated, and \"the manor of Littlebury\" is written in the margin. \" Gorham 's Lane\" still keeps its name, and is in the vicinity of \" Gorham's Holt \" (now the property of Mr. Slater of Spalding), which was thus noticed by Stukeley in the middle of the last century : \" At Theophilus Grant's house in Whaplode, near Gorham's Holt, aquaducts of clay, let one into another, have been dug up.\" (Itin. Curios. Centuria i. p. 14.) The Northamptonshire branch of this family, descended from Sir Hugh de Gorham, has not been traced lower than 1338 ; it seems to have fallen into obscurity soon after the alienation of the manor of Churchfield by his eldest son William. A trace of the family name, as connected with their property in that neighbourhood, remains in Benefield, where \" Gorham's Meadow\" still keeps its antient designation (1837). The name reappears u with considerable frequency in the parochial Regis- died in 1822, bequeathing this manor to Charles Bonner, Esq. of Spalding, and another, in trust for his family. (6.) Pipewell, or Pipewell Grange, was parcel of the monastery of Pipewell in Northamptonshire ; in 1596 Henry Pratt, gentleman, died seised of this manor, when it passed to his son and heir Anthony Pratt (Esch. 38 Eliz. MSS. Harl. 756, p. 234) ; in 1679 it belonged to Robert Beavour and Anne Peake, in 1697 to William Cawdrow in right of his wife; soon after, it was possessed by Michael Featherstone and Anne his wife ; in 1739 it was in the family of Smith, from whom it passed by sale in or about 1817 to William Roger- son, Esq. of Boston, with whose devisees it. now remains. \u2014 In 1384 William de Thorpe passed the manor of Whaplode to John le Warr (Fin.

No evidence uponJbj^fe- point can be obtained from the registers of those parishes, all of whichviSre of comparatively modern date ; with the exception of those of Ripton^aAbbot's, which commence in 1549. \" The Gorhams of New England are supposed to have emigrated from Benefield, in the reign of Charles I. \u2014 The following entry is from Benefield register : \" John Gorram son of Ralph Gorram, baptised Jan. 28, 1620\" [1621] ; the name of Ralph is not found in any subsequent register, though there are many entries of this family down to 1671. It was probably this Ralph Gorham who had a grant of land in New Plymouth, 1637; John Gorham (his son?) died there 1675, whose fifth descendant, John Gorham, Professor of Chemistry at Cambridge, Massachusets, died in 1829. *\u00bb John Gorham, who was settled at St. Neot's before 1676, and who died there in 1725, aged 88, is believed to be the same person as John Gorham, who was born at Glapthorne in 1637. There were at least four in successive descent, of the same Christian name, at Glapthorne, who probably connect this family with the antient Northamptonshire branch, and with their supposed ancestors the Anglo-Breton Gorrams : \u2014 (1) John Gorham, of Glapthorne, died 1588 ; \u2014 (2) John Gorham, of Glapthorne, died there 1617 ; \u2014 (3) John Gorham, of Glapthorne, born there 1606 or 1610 ; \u2014 (4) John Gorham, of Glapthorne, born there 1637. As the registers of St. Neot's go no further back than 1691, the identification of this last named per- son with John Gorham who died, at St. Neot's, aged 88, in 1725, is incomplete, and rests upon the concurrence of the dates and family tradition."], [362, "344 FAMILY OF DE GORHAM, OF LEICESTERSHIRE.

Some other trades and occupations may be noticed as having become obsolete, either in effect or in their designations : as, Robert Dorrington a spurrer, bur. 1591 ; Thomas Snelling, imbroderer, the same year; John Fisher, a shiere grinder, 1592; a Comfitmaker, 1597; gonne makers, in 1597 and 1600. Richard Delworth, elsewhere Tylsworth, \" french hoodmaker, 1601 ; Wm. Johnson, WTyredrawer, 1605; Edm. Bedo, tyremaker, 1605. In 1603 occur Henry Bateman, a barber surgion, out of Simondes Inne, bur. Sept. 27 ; and two more of the same pro fession, probably victims of the plague : Walter Shrauley, girdler, ] 603, and two others ; a clothworker ; and a tombmaker (Richard Oilworth). In 1608 another \" ymbrotherer ; \" in 1609 a \"wood monger;\" in 1611 a free mason, and another in 1612; in 1613 a Bayley of Middlesex; in 1614 Richard Cole, Myllener. In 1590 occurs the trade of pulter (not poulterer), and frequently that of upholster' (not upholsterer). The Vintners, drawers, and tapsters of the neighbouring taverns, are of frequent occurrence ; in 1599 a \" dreaman,\" and in 1600 an \" ale bruer.\" Water-bearers also are of frequent occurrence. In 1603 was buried \"Daniell Hill, Pannyer-man of the Midle Temple;\" and the same occupation occurs in 1605. There are many servants of the Inns of Court of various designations. As illustrative of the condition of the poor in the reign of Elizabeth, it may be noticed that, besides many nameless poor buried from houses, almost every year more than one entry occurs of persons who died in the field or street, who are recorded in this manner : 1573 Jan. 5. A poore man buryed oute of the fielde.m k Philip Rossiter was Master of the children of the Queen's Revels, by patent dated Jan. 4, 1609-10, and under that authority manager of the play-house in the Whitefriars.

Again, \"Mr. Richard Deakes, uphoul- ster,\" 1630. Both trades are so designated in Stowe's Survey. The incorrect reduplication is therefore of modern origin. Poulter still exists as a surname. m There were fields around the outskirts of Lincoln's Inn. Gardens in Chan- cery lane are frequently mentioned, and in 1609 we meet with \" the gardens in Fewter lane.\" Of the latter place (now Fetter lane) Stowe says in his Survey : \" Fewter lane stretcheth south, [from Oldbourne, now Holborn] into Fleet street, by the east end of Saint Dunstanes church, and is so called of Fewters for idle people) lying there, as in a wap leading lo gardens ; but the same is now of later yeeres nu both sides builded fhorow with many faire houses.''"], [397, "ST.

The burial of \"one of the seven sisters \" is of frequent recurrence. \" The Friars, sometimes called the White Friars, was the site of the house of Carmelites, placed on the south side of Fleet street, between the New or Inner Temple and Salisbury Court. As a sanctuary for debtors, and the consequent resort of dissolute characters, it subsequently became notorious, and under the slang name of Alsatia its fame has been widely spread by Sir Walter Scott's \" For- tunes of Nigel.\" It was not, however, entirely given up to the lower classes ; for, as Stowe says, \"in place of this Friers Church, bee now many faiie houses builded, lodgings for Noblemen and other ; \" and of this the present extracts have furnished ample proofs, in the names of Lord de la Warr, Sir Edward Carew, the Earl of Kent, Sir William Alford, Sir George Vane, &c. &c.

The records which the registers furnish of the mortality occasioned by the Plague may lastly be noticed. One of its visitations occurred in 1563, and is marked by an increase of entries. Again, in 1593 a large number are inscribed with the fatal p. in the paper book. In 1 603 the great plague of that year is denoted at once by a very considerable increase of interments, and by a total absence of persons of rank or importance ; for all who possessed means of escape, had fled. At the next great plague of 1625, all who died, or were supposed to die, of the disease are (in the vellum book) marked with a p. The first entry so distinguished is this : \" June 25. p Isabell Cadman, wid', from the backeside of the bell.\" On the 28th is another, and on the 29th Priscilla and Katharine Cad man from the tenement first infected. On the 2d of July, John Taylor, servant to John Livinge of White Friars, was buried; two days after fol lowed Elizabeth Fullerton, another servant of the same ; on the 15th, John Livinge himself, on the 21st his son John. At the beginning of August the family of Michael Leeke is awfully taken off; on the first his daughter Elizabeth, on the second his son Samuell, on the third the mother Jane and son Thomas, and on the fifth the father of the family.
