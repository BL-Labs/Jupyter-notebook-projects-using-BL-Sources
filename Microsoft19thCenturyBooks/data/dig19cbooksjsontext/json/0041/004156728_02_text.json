The Ground on which the present Chapel stands is most \" elevated, and appears to have been forced, and is trenched round ; from whence it may be \" presumed that there stood the Castle, Gaol, and Court-house in ancient Times. The Stones \" of which the Chapel is built, appear to have been taken from ancient. Structures; for such \" Materials are very scarce in that Part ofthe Country, the common Edifices being chiefly of ct Brick.

Derbyshire,) it will be necessrry first to remark, that the principal Part of the County, \" where Lead Ore is found in considerable quantify, is known by the Name of the King's \" Field. Nearly the whole AVapentake of Wirksworth comes under this denomination. \" This* does not appear always to have been the Case, sor in the. Time of the Saxons it \" belonged to the Abbey at Repton. But Mr. Pegge imagines that in the Year 874, when this <; Religious House was destroyed by (he Danes, it was escheated to the Crown, since it appears \" to have been in its possession, when Domesday Book was compiled. As to that Part ofthe \" FZing's Field, which is situated in the High Peak, I apprehend, that at least ever since the \" Norman Conquest it has been the Property ofthe Crown, and in the same Custody with the \" Castle. \u2014 Now all that Part of the County which comes under ths Denomination of the \" King's Field has been from Time immemorial let upon a Lease. The present Farmer ofthe \" Mineral Duties in the High Peak is the Duke of Devonshire, and in the Wapentake of \" AVirksworth the Widow of the late Rollcs, Esq. They have each a Steward and \" Barmasters in the different Districts, which they hold under the Crown. The Steward \" presides as Judge in'their Barmote Courts, and with twenty-four Jurymen chosen every half '^Year, determines all Disputes, which arise respecting the working of the Mines. For this \" Purpose they meet twice in the Year, and if requisite, may upon proper Notice, lie sum \" moned still oftener. In the High Peak the Courts are held at Moneyash, and in the AVapcn \" take at the Town of AVirksworth. \u2014 The Office of the Bar-master consists of various \" Branches. But the most material are putting Miners into Possession of Veins, which they \" have discovered, and collecting fhat Proportion of Ore, to which the Lessee of the Crown, \" or Lord of the Manor, has a Claim. \u2014 That Part of the King's Field, which is situated in \" the AVapentake of Wirksworth, is divided into eight Liberties. Now these, though under \" the same Jurisdiction, leased by the same Person, and subject to the same Duties, pay to \" very different Proportions. In Bonsai and Brassington every thirteenth Dish is due, but a *\u25a0 twenty-fifth only is taken. Neither of them is subject to a 'Tithe. Cromford pays every \" thirteenth Dish. The Tithe, Smitiiam and B< Hand excepted, is ever}' fortieth. In Elton \" the twenty -fifth is taken, and every tenth Dish is due as Tithe to the Duke of Rutland. *; At the capital Mines he lakes every nineteenth, but at tbe smaller ones at Discretion. One \" half of the Liberty of Matlock pays a thirteenth, and the other a twenty-fifth, but neither \" of them any Tithe. In Wirksworth, which produces a larger Quantity of Ore, than any *' other Liberty, a twenty-fifth is taken in some Places, and a thirteenth in others. A fortieth *f is due to the Vicar as Tithe. The Reason, why a larger Proportion of Ore is taken iu some \" Places than in others, is, that the former resisted the Claims of the Lessee of the Crown, \" when he asserted his Right to every thirteenth Dish of all kinds of Ore. \u2014 These Observa- \" tions have solely a Reference to the King's Field. But iu the Low Peak there are Mines \" also in Grounds, which are private Property. In this Case, Agreements are made between \" tlie Owner of the Land, and the labouring Miners ; and it concerns each Party to engage \" on Terms the most advantageous to themselves. \u2014 Besides the' Claims, which have been ** mentioned, there is another called Cope. In the Wapentake it is Four-pence, and in the \" High Peak Six-pence per Load, and is paid by the Buyer of the Ore to the Farmer of u the mineral Duties, or the Lord ofthe Manor.\" \u2014 Pilkington's Derbyshire, vol. 1, p.

The Assizes are always holden here. The Castle is used as the County Gaol both for Debtors and Felons. The Petty Sessions for The Liberty of S_. Peier of York are always holden at the Hall of Pleas within the Close ofthe Cathedral Church of A'ork. There are no Corporations or other Liberties within the Jurisdiction of the Liberty of St. Peter, which is locally situate partly within the City of A7ork, (for which there is a separate Clerk ofthe Peace,) and partly within the Three Ridings of the County of York; but itis not sabjectj to the Jurisdiction either of the City or County Magistrates, from such Eocality. \" The Account given us of an \" Archbishop's See being founded here by King Lucius, and of the three or .four Archbishops in \" the British Times, seems to be fabulous. It is more certain that the Metropolitical Church of \" St. Peter in this City owes its Original to Edwyn, King of the Northumbersj ; who, upon \" his Conversion to Christianity, A. D. 627, fixed Paulinus, Archbishop, in a little, Church \" built by him first of Wood, aud afterward begun by him of Stone, which' was carried on \" by King Oswald, and finished by Archbishop AVilfrid. This Church was burnt down '\u2022 first, A. D. 741, and being afterwards re-built, had the same Fate, A, D. 1069. Thomas, \" the first Norman Archbishop, constituted the several Dignities and Prebends, and made it a \" regular Chapter, began to repair the Cathedral, which was again destroyed by Fire, A. D. \" 1 137, but by the Munificence ancl Care of Archbishops Roger, John Romane, Melton, \u00a5 Thoresby, and other Benefactors, the stately Fabrick now standing was erected. To this \" Cathedral belong now the Archbishop, Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, Sub-dean, four Arch \" deacons, viz., of York, East Riding, Cleveland, and Nottingham, twenty-eight Prebend \" aries, a Sub-chantor, five Priest Vicars, seven Lay Clerks, six Choristers, four Vergers, with \" other Officers and Servants. The Revenues of the Archbishoprick were valued, 263 Hen. VIII., \"at \u00a32035. .3. .7, those ofthe Community or Canons Residentiary at \u00a3439.. 2.. 6, ofthe \" Dean at \u00a3308. .10. .7. Those of the other Members\" of this Church may be seen in Ecton's \" Valor. \u2014 AVithin the Close of the Cathedral here was a College of the thirty-six Vicars 11 Choral, called the Beddern, (from their Being required lq bed there, and not elsewhere, as \" it is said,) who lodged and eat in common therein under, the Direction of the Sub-chantor, \" who was stiled their Warden or Keeper.- This Place was given to them by AVilliam de \" Lanum, sometime Canon of this Church, and they were fixed here by AValter Gray, \" Archbishop, about the Arear 1252, but not properly incorporated till 9\" Hen. V. They \" had a Chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, but their House was called St. Peter's College, \" and under that Name granted, 2J Edw. VI., to Thomas Gold ing and AValter Cely.

III., founded an Hospital in the Parish of the Holy Cross, \" near Foss-gate, to the Honor of the Holy Jesusi. and the Blessed Virgin, and intended, to \" endow it with Revenues sufficient for the Maintenance of a Master or AVarden, thirteen \" poor and infirm People, and two poor Clergymen to teach School. But leaving very little \" Endowment to it, the incorporated Company of Merchants in this famous City endowed \" it, temp. Hen. VI., for one Priest, who was found to have a yearly Revenue, 26 ' Hen. VIII., \" of \u00a36.. 13. .4, as both Dugdale and Speed. It is still kept up by the Society of Merchant \" Adventurers, who maintain ten poor Widows there. \u2014 The Culdees or Secular Canons \" belonging to the Cathedral Church of St. Peter in the Time of King AVilliam the Conqueror \" founded, on a Piece of waste Ground near the West End, an Hospital for the Reoeption and \" Entertainment of poor People. King William Rufus removed this Hospital to another ***\u25a0 Part ofthe Cify, and so much enlarged the same both in Buildings and Revenues, that he \" is commonly accounted the Founder. It was called St. Peter's Hospital, till King Stephen \" erected within the Precinct's of it a large Church, which he dedicated to St. Leonard, after \" which it generally went by the Name of this last-mentioned Saint. Herein were maintained \" a Master, thirteen Brethren, four Secular Priests, eight Sisters, thirty Choristers, two School \" masters, two hundred and six Beadmen, and six Servitors, with Lands and Rents amounting \" in the whole to \u00a3500..
