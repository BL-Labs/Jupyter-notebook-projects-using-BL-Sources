The title \"Chinese Reader's Manual\" has been given to the following work in the belief that it will be found useful in the hands of students of Chinese literature, by elucidating in its First Part many of the personal and historical allusions, and some portion at least of the conventional phraseology, which unite to form one of the chief difficulties of the language ; Avhilst in its remaining sections information of an equally essen- tial nature is presented in a categorical shape. The wealth of illustration furnished to a Chinese writer by the records of his long-descended past is a feature which must be remarked at even the most elementary stage of acquaintance with the literature of the country. In every branch of composition, ingenious parallels and the introduction of borrowed phrases, considered elegant in proportion to then concise and recondite character, enjoy in Chinese style the same place of distinction that is accorded in European literature to originality of thought or novelty of diction. The Chinese are not, indeed, singular in the taste for metaphor or quotation adopted from the events or from the masterpieces of expression in the past. No European writer \u2014 it is needless to observe \u2014 can dispense with illustrations drawn from a multitude of earlier sources, and in even the most familiar language fragments of history and legend lie embedded, almost unperceived. What with ourselves,"], [12, "IV. PREFACE. however, is at the most an exceptional feature, takes with the Chinese the character of a canon of literary art. In tricacies of allusion and quotation present themselves, consequently, at every turn in the written language, to furnish a clue to some of which, and at the same time to bring together from various sources an epitome of his torical and biographical details much needed by every student, have been the principal objects of the present work. A complete and final execution of the design which was formed when the idea of publication first sug gested itself was soon discovered to be out of the question, its scope being virtually coextensive with the entire range of Chinese literature ; and the author anticipates criticism in this respect by acknowledging the empiricism of his plan. In arranging his materials he has found no other rule to follow than that afforded by his own experience of what is likely to prove most serviceable. To have extended the work indefinitely by simply transferring matter which stands ready to hand in the original autho rities would have been an easier task than that of com pressing it within the limits which have permitted its publication to be ventured upon ; and in the course of its execution the complaint of the great lexicographer of the last century, that \" to the weariness of copying there must be added the vexation of expunging, \" has often been forcibly recalled. Such as it is, and notwithstand ing defects and omissions of which no one can be more painfully aware than himself, the author is encouraged to hope that his work may prove not wholly without use as a contribution to the general stock of knowledge of Chinese subjects, and as a help toward familiarity with a vast and important body of literature."], [13, "PREFACE.

In Part I. of the following work, the designation \" In dex of Proper Names \" embraces both its principal feature as a historical and biographical compendium, and also the accounts of mythical beings and legends connected with animate or inanimate objects which cannot be over looked in an attempt at interpreting the figurative language or the traditional expressions of the Chinese. In the domain of history and biography, it has been sought to collect in a form convenient for reference the data existing in Chinese literature with regard to personages of renown in every epoch and condition, thus assembling what may be termed the component parts of a tableau of Chinese history from the mythical period down to the pre sent day. The principal object of the work being that of elucidating Chinese thought and expression, the language of the original authorities has been followed throughout as closely as possible ; and it has seemed expedient only in a few instances to enlarge on particular subjects from an in dependent point of view or with a critical intent. In the execution of this task a multitude of Chinese works have been collated, as no single native compilation unites the requisites demanded by a European enquirer. The author has at the'same time sought to remove those difficulties which attend the course of original research, owing not only to the absence of an alphabetic system, but, also to the disregard exhibited by most Chinese writers, notwith-"], [16, "INTRODUCTION. VIII standing the methodical genius of the people, for the simplest expedients of indexing and literary order. To dilate in this place upon the toil involved in most instances in consulting the huge and ill-arranged Chinese repertories might bear the semblance of overrating the labour be stowed on the preparation of the present work ; but it is impossible to avoid referring to one ofthe intricacies which a student must be prepared to encounter, in order to explain the system that has been devised to meet the difficulty. <i As is well known, every Chinese possesses, beside his surname or patronymic \u2014 ffe \u2014 and his cognomen \u2014 2^ \u2014 , a literary appellation \u2014 *$\u00a3. \u2014 by which he is most usually designated in familiar parlance or in literature ; in addition to which he may further adopt one or even several pseu donyms \u2014 Jj^lJ fj-\u00a3\u2014 -which are commonly employed as noms de plume. Moreover, in accordance with ancient custom, posthumous titles, constituting a species of canonization, are officially bestowed on persons of distinguished merit. Under some of the earlier dynasties, also, the practice of conferring patents of nobility with titles of a feudal order upon objects of Imperial favour was extensively followed. It is the practice of Chinese writers to mention individuals by one or other of these subsidiary epithets rather than by their surnames \u2014 a custom which adds greatly to the obscurity of such references ; and in order to overcome this difficulty, the Index of Proper Names has been ar ranged with a view to readiness of considtation by means of the radical Index given at the end, (see Part IV). The surnames being arranged alphabetically, according to English pronunciation, will be readily found ; and follow-"], [17, "INTRODUCTION. IX ing each are given, first the ordinary name and cognomen of the individual, next the literary appellation, preceded by an asterisk, and after this the pseudonym, indicated by a dagger, when a title of this kind has been adopted. In the body of the notice the titles of nobility and canoni zation are further introduced, and all these designations will be found indexed under their respective initial cha racters in Part IV. Through the same medium, proper names and phrases which are embodied in the numbered paragraphs of Part I. may likewise be traced. In addition to the historical and biographical sections of this Part, a limited number of illustrations of a my thological and legendary character are included. This department might be increased by many hundred-fold without exhausting the material collected in native cy clop\u00e6dias ; but the time has not yet arrived when a Eu ropean compiler can think it necessary, even were the un dertaking feasible, to offer a complete substitute for works of this kind in the profounder walks of Chinese study. It is scarcely probable that more than a fraction of such matter as is comprised within works of the kind referred to, indispensable though it be for occasional reference, can ever be transferred to a European language. Twenty volumes of the largest size would barely suffice to contain the matter categorically arranged in the most modern and useful cyclop\u00e6dia of literary reference, the Yiian Kien Lui Han ; nor would a less liberal allowance of space be sufficient to meet the wants of a complete biographical dictionary ; but the European student, whose researches carry him so far as to necessitate minute enquiry will, in most cases at least, be in a position to aA*-ail himself of"], [18, "X INTRODUCTION. the original authorities. A list is given below of the principal works from which the present epitome has been drawn. In addition to the storehouses of information arranged in cyclop\u00e6diac form, it has been necessary to resort largely to original sources. The Sze Ki of Sze-ma Ts'ien has been analyzed on behalf of Chinese history down to the period, about B.C. 100, at which this great work was written, and for subsequent history the Tung Kien Kang Muh, with its continuations, has been diligently explored. It is only when approaching the modern period that original materials become scanty. The Chinese have at all times been chary in commenting upon historical events during the existence of the dynasty under which they have taken place ; and owing to this circum stance it has not been an easy task to assemble particulars relating to the celebrated characters of the last two centuries and a half. To the author's great regret, he became aware only after his manuscript had passed into the printer's hands of the appearance of a work4' in 24 volumes, published in 1869, which is devoted exclusively to notices of the statesmen and scholars of the present dynasty. Notwithstanding this drawback, however, it is believed that few of the truly eminent names which have graced the Manchow dominion in China will be found wanting from the present record. Individual memoirs and collections, such as the J|\u00a3 \u00a3\u00bb. f-f*- and the |5. -fiji, together with the jftljl^fj and the \u00a7\u00a3l b\u00a3$B> have in a measure, supplied the want of more detailed and classified repertories.

XI little manual which has proved invaluable in supple menting one of the gravest among the defects that attach to all Chinese biographical compilations. In none of these works is the period at which an individual has flourished indicated more nearly than by mention of the dynasty under which he lived. The precision of date which a European inquirer considers a prime requisite is esteemed in a different light by the Chinese. Fortunately for the author's purpose, the intelligent antiquarian scho lar Ts'ien Ta-hin, conscious of this short-coming, applied himself in his old age to collecting the dates of birth and death of celebrated statesmen and scholars from the Han dynasty downwards ; and this undertaking, left incom plete at his death early in the present century, was pu blished, with an addendum equalling in extent the original work, by a literary executor. To this most useful, though unpretending, compilation, the author must express an acknowledgment of great indebtedness. The Numerical Categories which constitute the matter presented in Part II. have occupied a prominent place in Chinese thought from the very earliest period to which our knowledge reaches. In obedience, it would seem, to an impulse the influence of which is distinctly marked in the literary traditions of the Chald\u00e6ans, the Hebrews, and the Hindoos, a doctrine of the hidden properties and harmonies of number imbues the earliest recorded expres sion of Chinese belief. So also, it may be remarked, in the teachings of Pythagoras, an abstract theory of Number was expounded as underlying the whole system of Exis tence, whence the philosophy of the Western world became tinged with conceptions strongly resembling those which"], [20, "introduction. XII still prevail on the same subject in the Chinese mind \u2014 conceptions which, although now wellnigh forgotten, re mained in vigour long after the days of Bacon as funda mental truths. That the views inculcated by Pythagoras were derived from Asiatic sources is a commonly received assertion ; and it may well be that the ideas found cor responding in his philosophy with those of the Chinese were handed down from the earliest observers of the material phenomena of nature. The dual form of animated life, the succession of the seasons, the alternation of day and night, the revolutions of the visible planets, may not improbably have given rise to a conception of numerical harmony obeying some mysterious and unchanging law, when contemplated by minds striving after the rudiments of knowledge and absorbed in attempts to fathom the causes and order of existence. In the \" Great Plan,\"* which forms one of the most highly reverenced sections of the Book of History, we see how profoundly the metaphysical speculations of the Chinese had become developed on a basis of this description in the most ancient times. The cast imparted to the national philo sophy in this ninefold exposition of physical and ethical laws, minutely classified in numerical divisions, has been maintained unimpaired to the present day, gathering strength, indeed, in the course of ages from the subtle refinements of Hindoo cosmogonists and religious teachers. Tracing in this wise the tendency of Chinese thought to adopt numerical forms of expression from its earliest discovered source, it is not necessary to exclaim with the polished French reviewer, Ampere, that \"pour saisir (*)$\u00a3 $E> The Great Plan, fonninp; Book TV of the Shoo King. See Le<j\u00b0*e's \"Chiueso Classics,\" Vol. Ill, pp. 321\u2014344."], [21, "introduction. XIII quelque chose de tellement Chinois il faiidmit se faire Chinois soi-meme, penser et eerire en Chinois.\" That a logical conception of the Chinese theories of numerical concordance may be formed and may even be expounded in a European tongue has been shewn by the late T. T. Meadows in his admirable though unhappily incomplete dissertation on the philosophy of the Chinese.\"5'' No faithful translator will console himself with M. Ampere's dictum for neglecting to render in his own language the combinations which form an essential element of Chinese style, whether belonging to the domain of metaphysics or to the practical details which are equally reduced to serial order ; and the undertaking carried out in Part II. of the present work is a humble contribution to this end. Its basis was provided more than six centuries ago by the erudite scholar Wang Ying-lin, whose desire to afford instruction for every age was testified no less by his composition of the EE -J- $2 or Trimetrical Classic, which is still the primer committed to memory by every Chinese lad, than in compiling his great cyclop\u00e6dia, the 3S '/$, a monument of industry and learning. Annexed to this extensive work is a treatise specially devised as a text book for youthful study, entitled the /J\u00bb \u00a3\u00a7b %$ $f, which for the first time brought together a collection of the numerical categories occurring in every department of literature. To this w^ork the author must acknow- ledge deep obligations, although subsequent writers have improved extensively, both in matter and arrange ment, upon the original manual of Wang Ying-lin. The most complete among modern collections of the kind is (*) \"The Chinese and their Rebellions,\" chap. 18."], [22, "introduction. XIV the work of Kung Meng-jen, which will be found men tioned in the list of authorities below. In one respect, it should be noted, the author's la bours have been abridged through the appearance, while his work was yet in progress, of the Rev. E. J. Eitel s \" Handbook of Chinese Buddhism\" which has forestalled the task of interpreting the large addition of categorical phraseology derived by Chinese literature from Buddhist sources. This labour having already been achieved by Dr. Eitel as an integral portion of his most valuable compendium, all but a limited number of Buddhistical categories, constituting elements of ordinary Chinese ex pression, too noteworthy to be passed over in silence, have been excluded from the present collection. Part III. consists in Chronological Tables reproduced, with considerable additions and emendations, from those already published by the author.\"' As students are aware, a number of distinct conditions require to be fulfilled in order to supply a complete index of Chinese historical dates. In the absence of any fixed starting point of chronology, events are dated usually according to the years of each Emperor's reign ; and the Emperor, again, may be designated either by the posthumous title t conferred upon him by his successor, or by the appellation \\ chosen to designate his period of rule. It is necessary, therefore, to fix not only the date of ac cession of the Emperor known by his canonical title, but (*_) See \"Transactions ofthe North-China Branch ofthe Royal Asiatic Society,\" 1867, Art.

XV also that of each period of his reign as distinguished by its special appellation. This object is fulfilled in the Historical Tables of Part III., which embrace all the dynasties recognized in Chinese history, with the excep tion only of the minor ephemeral claimants of sovereignty who have branched off at various periods from the legi timate line. Beside these data, however, a further requirement demands attention. From time immemorial, the Chinese have employed a combination of two sets of characters, numbering ten and twelve respectively, to form a cycle of sixty terms for the purpose of chronological notation. The period at which this cycle was invented is a subject upon which complete uncertainty prevails,\"' but there is little doubt that it first came into use as a method of reckoning years after the reform of the calendar in B.C. 104. Later historians, nevertheless, have not scrupled to refer its usage to the earliest ages, and even to attribute its invention to the mythical Emperor Hwang Ti. The reion of this Sovereign is stated to have begun in B.C. 2097, and the invention of the cycle has been placed in the eighth year of his reign. With some writers, the first cycle is made to date from the first year of Hwang Ti, but the system most commonly followed begins with his sixty-first year, or B.C. 2637, and the present tables are drawn up in conformity with this plan. Although the varying commencements of the Chinese year at different periods, and the confusion into which the calendar has more than once fallen, make it certain that absolute ac- s'1') Seethe able \"Dissertation on the Astronomy of the Ancient Chinese\" by tbe Rev.

XVI curacy of comparison cannot be relied upon, particularly for the period antecedent to Sze-ma Ts'ien's reform, the dates based upon the Christian era may be assumed as substantially agreeing with those of the Chinese cyclical period to which they correspond in Tables I. and II. For the period preceding the Christian era they differ from the chronology adopted by the Rev. Dr. Legge in his \" Chi nese Classics \" by one year throughout, For the sake of reconciling his data with astronomical rules, it would seem, the learned translator and annotator of the Classics has interpolated a blank year at the commencement of our era. In a note on page 167 of his \"Shoo King\" Dr. Legge remarks on a discrepancy between his own dates and those of Pere Gaubil, saying : \" There is no real difference between him and me, as I do not reckon the year of our Lord's birth, the dates in my scheme of Chinese chronology running thus : \u2014 A. D. 1 ; A. D. ; B.C. 1. Gaubil reckoning: A.D. 1; B.C. 1, my B.C. 2158 is with him B.C. 2159.\" However desirable it may have been for Dr. Legge's purposes to pursue the method to which he thus directs attention, it would seem that in ordinary usage a grotesque effect cannot fad to be produced if the year 0 be introduced at the intersection of two eras such as we possess ; and the author has seen no reason to depart from the more regular course already sanctioned by the authority of Gaubil. It may be noticed here, in conclusion, that some years after the publication at Shanghai of the author's Historical Tables, a work \" embracing a compilation (*; Observations of Comets from B.C. 611 to A.D. 1640, extracted from the Chinese Annals.

A., who had with great industry elaborated a system of chronology from Japanese sources, in obvious ignorance that the task he thus undertook had been anticipated in another quarter. The author notes with satisfaction that an authority on astronomy such as Mr. Williams gives countenance to the method he has himself pursued in respect of cyclical notation for the pre-Christian period. The following is a list of some of the principal works upon which the matter contained in Parts I. and II. is based.

The Mongol emperors were also liberal patrons of the family, who have continued, until the present day, to claim the headship of the Taoist sect.

The latter, according to one version of a romance which is variously related, had been commissioned to bring her to the palace, on a report of her beauty reach ing the court, and she was found by him to be of surpassing loveliness, the daughter of poor but worthy parents. Her father refused to pay a sum demanded from him as a bribe by Mao Yen-show, who, in revenge, pre sented to the Emperor a portrait so little like the original that his Majesty conceived no wish to see the new addition to his seraglio, and she lan guished in oblivion for years until chance threw the Emperor across her path, when he at once became enamoured of her beauty. The faithless Minister, his wiles discovered, fled from Court and took refuge with the Khan of the Hiung-nu, to whom he shewed the real portrait of Chao Kiin. The Khan, fired by the hope of obtaining possession of so peerless a beauty, invaded China in irresistible force, and only consented to retire beyond the Wall when the lady was surrendered to him.

On the accession of the youthful ruler Kung Ti, A.D. 960, at a time when the Empire was in disorder and when invasion by the Tartars was imminent, Chao Kw'ang yin was despatched as generalissimo to take command of the army. The soldiery, dissatisfied with their prospects under a weak boy-ruler, and im- pelled by sundry current prophecies, determined to make the general their monarch. While halting at a post called the Bridge of Ch'en [^ **fj|J, a resolution was taken, and the tent of the generalissimo was tumultuously surrounded at midnight.

A functionary of the State of Chao, whom the lord of P'ing Yiian (see No. 563) recommended for employment as steward of the revenues of the kingdom, in consequence of the wise advice that he had tendered. The armies of the unscrupulous and aggressive sovereign of Ts'in having wantonly invaded the territory of Chao and seized a position at Yen-yii |\u00a7|j -tai, the prince took counsel with his ministers respecting the possibility of dislodging the enemy. His chief counsellor, Lien P'o Jfjf jjp(, gave an unfavourable reply ; but Chao Sheh volunteered to undertake the task, and moved with an army against the invaders, undismayed by their numbers or by the difficulties of the mountainous region in which his field of operations lay. By the main tenance of severe discipline and of a Fabian course of policy, remaining firmly behind his entrenchments, (whence the expression i]j>* *-ffir has taken rise) until the proper moment for action arrived, he lulled the hostile forces into a fatal self-confidence, and eventually routed them with great slaughter.

As the sovereign nevertheless persisted in his design, Chao Kwoh's mother presented a memorial in which she set forth her knowledge of her son's in capacity for the post of commander, but without effect. Finding that the appointment was irrevocable, she again addressed the Prince entreating that at least she might be spared from undergoing punishment on account of the failure which she foresaw her son was about to incur.

His rule was. without difficulty, extended over the whole region at present constituting the provinces of Kwang-tung and Kwang-si.

Many legends are related in con nection with this gem, which from the earliest times has been prized by the Chinese. In the time of the Han dynasty pearls were produced in great abundance on the coast of Ho-p'u (a district in the modern Lien-chow Fu in Kwangtung, near Hainan), and here the virtues of Meng Ch'ang q. v. were attested by a plentiful harvest of pearls. \u2014 The wife and family of an official named Wang Chang J=P, on his being thrown into prison unjustly in the reign of Han Ch'eng Ti, B.C. 24, were banished to Ho P'n, and on being permitted afterwards to return from exile, came back to their home laden with riches of their own gathering \u2014 a presumed recompense from Heaven. \u2014 A pair of pearls of great size were found on the bank of the Kw'en Ming Lake, in fullfilment of a dream experienced by the Emperor Wu Ti of the Han dynasty.\u2014 Ma Yuan q. v. was unjustly accused after his death of having secretly brought back a great hoard of pearls from his conquests in Cochin China. \u2014 It is related of Wen Ti of the Wei dynasty that a pearl of one inch in diameter having been spontaneously offered him as tribute by the ruler of a State in Central Asia, the sovereign took coun sel with his adviser Su Tseh j|| j|lj about sending an envoy to seek to purchase others like it. His counsellor replied : \" It is something to be"], [57, "Pt. I.

Hence the pearl acts as a charm against fire, the development of the active or pri mary principle. \u2014 The Taoist mystics have ascribed many wondrous stories to the same gem, and in their writings the yeh ming chu *fl^ Ijfj J^ or \"night-shining pearl\" is first heard of.

The most eminent among the later Chinese philo- sophers, and expounder of the doctrines formed by the schoolmen of the Sung dynasty (~^Z H\u00a7)* Born in Fu-kien, where his father (a native of Ngan-hwei), was in official employ, he displayed in early childhood signs of a precocious intellect, and was abb to take his second degree at the literary examinations before reaching his 20th year. After receiving an official appointment he devoted himself for some years to the study of Buddhism aud Taoism, but abandoning after a time these heterodox philosophies, he threw himself with ardour into the work of criticism and exposition of the ethical writings upon which the Confucian system is based, and which for nearly a century before bis time had been studied in a new light by the famous scholars Chow Tun-i, the brothers Ch'eng, qq. v. and their disciples. While holding various provincial offices he diligently pursued his metaphysical speculations, and the renown of his erudition and'judgement reaching the Emperor's ears, he was more than once summoned to Court and consulted as an adviser in literary and political affairs. In 1180, he was appointed Governor of Nan-K'ang (in modern Ki.mg-si), where, by applying the Confnci-ftu principle? of paternal"], [58, "Pt.

His fame is, however, still more closely connected with the metaphysical speculations in which he sought to elucidate she doctrines of Confucius and Mencius with reference to the nature of man, the origin of good and evil, and the principles of creation. He maintained the orthodox doctrine that the nature of man is by its origin entirely good, and sought to explain the mystery left unsolved by the ancient sages, viz, the source and prevalence of evil. From this central point his theories, amplifying those of his im mediate predecessors, extended to the widest field of metaphysical specula tion, his views in respect of which have continued to the present day to be almost universally received, and have been stamped with the approbation of successive dynasties. His commentaries on the classical writings have formed for centuries the recognized standard of orthodoxy, but within the last hundred and fifty years critics have arisen who have vigorously impugned the doctrines of his school. \u2014 Cf.

When sought out by Liu Pei, whom his fame for wisdom had reached, he was found (A.D. 207), inhabiting a hut of reeds, and was with difficulty persuaded to abandon his hermit's life for a career in camps and courts. After serving Liu Pei until the latter's death with unbroken fidelity, he continued to be the counsellor and generalissimo of the deceased sovereign's son and successor. Beside conducting glorious campaigns against the rival dynasties of Wu and Wei, he led an army in A.D. 225, to the wild and unexplored regions now forming the northern portion of Yiin-nan, where he subdued a powerful chieftain. Many legends are narrated of this campaign, in which the Chinese arms are reputed to have been carried as far as the heart of Burmah.

Like the latter, although said to have held an official post, he refused all offers of advancement, contemning the avocations of practical life as unworthy a philosopher's attention. Al though believed to have been contemporary with Mencius, the teachings of neither, although diametrically opposed to each other, appears to have at tracted the other's attention, and it is surmised that only in later ages did the mystic speculations of Chwang Tsze obtain any considerable following. The latter's preference for retirement and the synical view of life, and of human nature avowed by him gave a marked direction to the early school of Taoist philosophers, and his writings rose to high repute under the pat ronage of T'ang Hiian Tsung (Ming Hwang) during the eighth century.

At a solemn audience, at which the Emperor was seated behind the curtain that had screened the Empress from the gaze of her ministers, the sovereign announced that his mother had ac ceded to the advice given by Han K'i ; whereupon the latter called loudly to the attendants to withdraw the curtain ; and as the screen was lifted, the robes of the Empress were seen disappearing behind the throne, \u2014 a signifi cant proof of the tenacity with which she had clung to power.

He advanced a new theory upon the constitution of man's nature, in which he sought to harmonize the conflicting doctrines of Mencius and Siin Tsze, and to prove that human nature is divided into three classes, viz., that in which innate goodness prevails, that which is innately evil, and a third which occupies a middle position, sharing the qualities of the other two. This doctrine was largely accepted, until superseded at length by the theories of the schoolmen of the Sung dynasty (see Chu Hi).

According to Hwai Nan Tsze, the natural growth of gold takes place by slow but progressive evolutions, commencing with the immaterial principle of creation, and passing through silver up to the precious metal itself. Another mystic asserts that gold is the perfected essence of mountain rock, which after the lapse of one thousand years is converted into quicksilver. The latter substance, being called into existence by the female or lunar principle in nature, is accordingly fluid and incapable of concretion until acted upon by the pure masculine or solar principle, fyvji Xy%j J^ -J^, when it becomes transmuted into gold.

Hence k'iung tan J jj is employed as a generic term for the occult preparations which constituted the draught of immortality or the powder of transmutation. (See Tan). In poetry, k'iung is used as a convertible term with Jq. jade-stone, and also, in allu sion to the milk-white purity of one of the most highly prized varieties of the gem, as a synonym for whiteness or spotlessness.

CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. 101 and example has been well-nigh absolute over the Chinese mind, led by insensible steps to elevate the philosopher into a model of ideal perfection. For many centuries past, and by unanimous consent, Confucius has been venerated as the one being upon earth who was endowed with wisdom unalloyed ; who, without any claim to divine inspiration or reliance upon supernatural powers, had an intuitive knowledge of righteousness ; whose every word was a priceless inheritance, and every action a \" pattern to the succeeding ages.\" Such has been the judgement of posterity, commencing from a period about two centuries and a half subsequently to the Sage's death, but even during his lifetime he was undoubtedly reverenced as a man of surpassing wisdom and eminent goodness. His father K'ung-shuh Liang- heh lj\\j yffl. -Ttc ffij was a military officer of the State of Lu <g! (occu- pying part of the modern province of Shan-tung), a man of great personal prowess and unusual strength and stature. This warrior was the son of Peh Hia \"f\u00a3f Jj|, whose father, K'ung Fang-shuh |$f J$f had migrated into Lu from his native country, the state of Sung 3^, in order to escape from the enmity of a powerful hereditary foe. This period, with the centuries immediately preceding and ensuing upon it, was the feudal age of China's history, when the sovereignty ofthe emperors ofthe Chow dynasty had become reduced to little more than an empty pageant, and the actual functions of government had wholly passed mto the hands of a varying number of vassal princes, who ruled their respective territories or States ( (fy ) with all the attributes of sovereign power. History records that the soldier Shuh Liang-heh had married in early life a lady named She fffj^ JA^, who bore him nine daughters, and a concubine by whom he had a son, a cripple, who was called Meng P'i Jg Jjj\u00a3. When more than seventy years of age, yearning for direct offspring, he sought in marriage one of the three daughters of the Yen family |p| J^, of whom the youngest, Cheng Tsai \\jk ?\u00a3 by name, espoused him in dutiful obedience to her father's command.

The fabulists of later ages have recorded a multitude of supernatural or marvellous occurrences which heralded the birth of tho sage, and attended his growth in years ; but these are merely transparent imitations of the Hindn legends relating to the \"nativity of Shakyamuni, (Buddha), and are considered as mere romance by the Chinese themselves. They may be found dwelt upon at some length in the '\u2022 Life of Confucius \" contained in chapter V. of Vol. I. of the Chinese Classics, by the Rev. James Legge, D.D., to which reference must be made for anything more than a summary of the leading facts in the Sage's career. These \u2014 as distinguished from later embellishments \u2014 are narrated by the historian Sze-ma Ts'ien, whose work, composed about B.C. 100, already assigns a prominent position to the Sage, with a pro phetic sense, it is contended, of the glory that was held in store for his reputation. Of his early years, little is recorded beyond the fact of his displaying a temperament unusually sedate and prone to ceremonial usage. At the age of nineteen he married, and in the following year his wife gave birth to a son (see K'ung Li). About this period he is found engaged in official duties, as a comptroller of the public granaries, and shortly after wards he became surrounded by a school of young men, who enrolled themselves as his pupils in the study of morality and the teachings of the ancient sages, which he had made the field of enthusiastic and reverent research. It is owing to these disciples that the greater part of what is known respecting the Sage and his teachings has been transmitted to* posterity. Confucius himself composed no doctrinal work. An assiduous student of the then existing records or traditions concerning tho great dynastic founders of the Chinese polity, he held up for the admiration of his pupils and his countrymen at large the virtuous endeavours of these wise rulers, and the principles upon which under their government the Empire was ordered. The lessons which he drew from these sources and inculcated in his conversations or by his example, are preserved in the collection of notes or discourses, g^g gq which, (translated by Dr. Legge under the title of Confucian Analects), forms one of the Four Books j/Gj \u2022flf constituting the most sacred portion of the Chinese canon of philoso-"], [135, "Pt. I. CHINESE READERS MANUAL. 103 phy and instruction. In these dialogues he is seen expounding his views upon the duty of man, in which obedience to parents and to rulers, humi lity and contentment, a reverence for antiquity and strict adherence to the traditional usages of ceremony, occupy tlie principal place. The Book which contains this embodiment of the sages' lessons is considered as having been the joint production of some of his chief diseiples; and his teachings were amplified and consolidated in other treatises, the \u00a3$!? and Fp j^, which constitute, with the above-named, tbe so-called Con fucian Books. When at the zenith of his repute as a teacher, he repaired to the imperial capital, the city of Loh yi\u00a7-, (near the site of the modern Ho-nan Fu), with the intent of studying there the records of antiquity. This visit has been rendered memorable by an interview which is said to have taken place between Confucius and the founder of a school of thought entirely opposed to his own, the philosopher Lao Tan or Lao Tsze q.v.*; but the narrative upon which this incident in the life of Confucius is based is drawn from the writings of Chwang Tsze, a disciple of Lao Tan, and is discredited in consequence by the followers of the orthodox sage. Their reluctance to accept the story of this encounter, although supported by the authority of Sze-ma Ts'ien, arises from the fact that Con fucius is represented in the legend as having been disconcerted by the lofty speculations and bold language of the Taoist philosopher, who did not hesitate to evince contempt for the petty maxims with which his comtem porary sought to regulate the relations of human society. Returning to his native state Confucius was made chief magistrate of the town of f-J-J :jU$, where, by applying in practice the principles of government he had already taught, he wrought, it is said, a marvellous reformation in the manners of the people. The ruler of Lu, Duke Ting /\u00a3, -^>, raised him from this position to the higher office of Minister ofWoiks pj and subsequently to that of Minister of Justice W] ffc, during his occupancy of which posts he \"became the idol of the people, and flew in songs through their mouths,\" (L. O, L, proleg pp. 74, 75). The regard of his sovereign became, however, alienated from him through the intrigue of a neigh bouring Prince, the Duke of Ts'i, who grew jealous of tbe prosperity which under his renovating influence the State of Lu had attained. In order to divert the mind of Duke Ting from serious thoughts he sent to"], [136, "CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. Pt. I. 104 that potentate a present of eighty of the most beauteous damsels of Ts'i, trained to the performances of music and dancing, together with 30 spans (ShU*) comprising four each) of the finest horses. The enjoyment derived from these acquisitions caused the wise minister to be neglected by his sovereign, and Confucius, now in his 57th year, withdrew from his office, trusting, but in vain, that this act would prove a warning to Duke Ting.' During the remainder of his life he travelled from State to State, received in some places with honour, in others lest wholly neglected, but always attended by some of his faithful disciples. During these years of leisure he turned to account his lifelong study of the records of antiquity, and rendered services which have been declared inestimable by posterity in col lecting and arranging the basis of the works which now, under the title of King ;j<?\u00a3, form the second portion of the canonical Scriptures. In B.C. 481, he undertook the composition of the only original work derived from his pen, a chronicle of the history of his native State, commencing with the year 722 B.C., to which he gave the name Chun Ts'iu j|p (Spring and Autumn), with reference, it is presumed, to the succession of the seasons. In this work he sought especially to make the facts of history a vehicle for inculcating the principles maintained in his teachings. While engaged in its composition, news was brought to him that a marvellous beast had been captured during a hunting expedition of Duke Ngai of Lu (to which State Confucius had now returned), and this beast the sage at once recognized as tbe supernatural lin |gpl, the appearance of which at a time when disorder universally prevailed he looked upon as of evil omen. Profoundly affected by the occurrence, he exclaimed that his end was drawing near and his teachings exhausted ; and with the record of this event he closed his historical labour. Two years afterwards, he breathed his last, and was interred in immediate proximity to his family residence. His disciples reared a tomb over his remains, which continues venerated to this day, as a sacred spot, adorned and enriched by successive dynasties, and which even the most lawless rebels have treated with re spect. (Cf. Williamson's Journeys in North China, Vol. I., p. 224). By this tomb the main body of his pupils mourned during three years, but the devoted Tsze Kung dwelt in a hut beside it for three years longer. The memory of the philosopher was venerated and his teachings were"], [137, "Pt. I. CHINESE READERS MANUAL. 105 handed clown during the ensuing ages, by a succession of disciples, but it was not until nearly three hundred years after his decease, when the feudal system was on the point of disappearing and a general reform in the prin ciples of government was introduced under the newly-founded dynasty of Han, that recognition was accorded to his memory by Imperial command. Kao Tsu, the first sovereign of the Han dynasty, visited his tomb, and offered a sacrifice before it ; and the recovery of the canonical texts in the reign of his successors, who diligently endeavoured to repair the losses caused by the prescription of ancient literature during the reign of She Hwang-ti q.v., stimulated a fresh and increasing veneration for a teacher who constituted a prominent link with the glorious past, and whose doctrines were entirely ac ceptable to the possessors of absolute power. His descendants were employed in honourable posts, and in A.D. 1 the emperor P'ing Ti caused a temple to be erected in which sacrifices were to be offered to bis manes jointly with those of the model he venerated, the Duke of Chow, (see Chow Kung), and the title j|| Jj|j\u00a3 JE^ \u2014 \"illustrious Duke Ni, lord of completed praise,\" was attributed to Confucius. During some centunes, the sage was consequently referred to as jg JEj^, or _g_ but in A.D. 739 the emperor Hiian Tsung advanced him to a position of higher sanctity than that of the Duke of Chow, and canonized him as Ja 3E \u2014 Prince of Illustrious Learning, since which date he has been recognized as the chief national object of sacrificial honours. At the same time the sub sidiary title of ;/Q g? or \"sage of antiquity \" was attributed to him by the imperial will; and in A.D. 1012 the emperor Sung Chen Tsung sub stituted for this, the epithet :\u00a7S 1|? or Most perfect Sage, which the mandates of succeeding sovereigns have confirmed.

The actual range of mountains to which this name is applied is identified by modern geographers with the Hindu Kush, but it is chiefly in ancient fable and Taoist mythology that mention of it occurs. The name is found in the Shu King, in the ancient record entitled the Tribute of Yii (-^ J|\\ L.C., III., p. 127), where it is spoken of among the spots whence the wild tribes of the West J25 33C> brought haircloth aud skins ; but at a very early period the cosmogonists and mystics appear to have elevated it to the position of the central mountain of the earth and the source whence the ' four great rivers\" take their rise. Thus in the Shan Hai King, it is alleged that 'Mount Kw'en Lun is 10,000 li in circumference and 11,000 li in height. Around its base flow the blue river, the white river, the red river, and the black river.\" Lieh Tsze, in his allegorical rhapsody, based on the legend of Chow Mu Wang, dilated on its marvels as the residence of the queen of the genii, Si Wang Mu qv., and from his day onward the fabnlists have vied with one another in fantastic descriptions of the wonders of this fairy abode. Hwai Nan Ts?e, with his accustomed wealth of detail, portrays the mountain and its accessories in terms which have given birth to count less later fictions. He says : It has walls piled high in nine-fold grada tions iffi, jl, g, rising to the height of 11,000 li, 114 paces, 2 feet, and 6 inches; and upon it there grow trees and grain.

CHINESE READERS MANUAL. 109 other marvels are related of the mountain and its appurtenances, the source of which may be traced through more than one indication to the legends of the Hindu mythology. Thus in the f^ gjj the statement occurs that \"Mount Kw'en Lun is called in the West Mount Sii-mi *^fi\" \u2014 the well-known Chinese equivalent for Sumeru, the abode of Indra and his consort, with whom there is consequently ground for identifying Tung Wang Kung and Si Wang Mu. The description which is appended to this mention of Mount Kw'en Lun bears moreover a striking re semblance to many of the features of the Hindoo legends. The mountain is said to be peopled with genii, who cultivated upon its terraces tbe \"fields ofsesamum\" \u00a3, EB an(^ \"gardens of coriander\" fS^ |ffj], (seeds which are eaten in lieu of ordinary food by the votaries of longevity).

He forthwith asked her hand in marriage, but her mother re- plied that his suit could be entertained only on the condition that he should produce a pestle and mortar of jade Jl Tsf- Q, for the purpose of pound ing certain magic drugs bestowed upon her by a genie. After a month's search, the scholar found the required articles, and obtained his bride in exchange for them. He was afterwards admitted with her into the ranks of the genii. From these two stories, the name of the Bridge has become symbolical of lover's trysts and betrothals. 333. \u2014 Lan T'ing gM *\u00a3jp\u00bb.

His history is almost alto gether legendary ; but amid the cloud of fables narrated concerning him, his biography, as given by Sze-ma Ts'ien, contains some particulars which may be regarded as perhaps authentic. According to this account, he was a keeper of the records at Lob f\u00a7-, the capital of the Chow dynasty, about the close of the sixth century B.C., and professed a doctrine of abstraction from worldly cares, based upon speculations concerning Tao and Teh -j^, (see post), which excited the curiosity of the sage Confucius himsef and led to an interview between them, from which the orthodox philo sopher retired disconcerted with the bold flights of imagination he en countered in Lao Tsze, ' soaring dragon-like above the clouds to Heaven.\" Doubt is, however, cast upon the veracity of this legend, which is derived from the writings of Chwang-tsze, himself a follower of the Taoist patriarch. After a long period of service, Lao Tsze retired from his employ, foreseeing the decadence of the house of Chow, and betook himself toward the West, On reaching the frontier pass of Han Kuh \\Ut\\ 4^ [pi], the governor of the gate, Yin Hi, besought him to indite his thoughts in writing before retiring from the world, and the philosopher accordingly prepared a work in two sections, treating of Tao and Teh, after committing which to the care of Yin Hi, he disappeared from mortal ken. To this brief record a later tradition adds that Yin Hi, a scholar versed in the secrets of astrology, was warned beforehand by supernatural appearances of the sage's coming, and after obtaining from his pen the precious treatise, departed in his company for the deserts of the West, riding upon a car drawn by black oxen. The later mystics improved upon the current legend by assigning a period of fabulous antiquity and a miraculous concep tion through the inflnence of a star to Lao Tsze's birth, alleging him to have been the incarnation of the supreme celestial entity which they named yfc _L yg T\u00a7\\ or the Venerable Prince [of] the Great Supreme, whence he is also entitled Lao Kiin. According to the fabulous account given in the f[lj -f^, he became incarnate in B.C. 1321, and was born of a woman in (J}] *\u00a3Z J||, a village of the State of Ts'u. His mother brought him forth from her left side, her delivery taking place under a plum-tree i^p^gj, to which he at once pointed, saying I take my surname (viz., Li) from this tree!\" When first born, his head was white and his countenance as"], [144, "112 CHINESE READERS MANUAL. Pt. I. that of an aged man, from which circumstance he derived his designation' of L:io Tsze \u2014 the Old Child. He is further represented as having served Wu Wang, the founder of the Chow dynasty, B.C. 1122, as keeper ofthe records, and to have wandered to the ' furthest extremities of earth,\" in cluding the countries called Ta Ts'in ~fc |jf; and Tu K'ien \u00a3\u00a3\u2022 |p\u00a3, where he converted men to his doctrines, and again returned lo China to undergo the episode of his rencontre with the keeper of the gate, the date of which is placed in B.C. 1030. As this legend is obviously of an epoch posterior to the introduction of Buddhism in China there is every reason to believe it an invention based on the acconnts of Shakyamuni's nativity, and designed to vie with the marvels narrated concerning the latter. The longevity ascribed to him is only what should be expected of the patriarch of a sect whose chief aim in after ages became tbe achievement of cor poreal immortality. No countenance is given, however, in the writings ascribed to his pen to marvels of this kind or supernaturalism of any description. The ideas which can be actually traced in his Treatise on Tao and Teh (the |\u00a7 1\u00a9 \u25a0\u2022\u25a0jia?**' mav he summed up as follows: Crea tion proceeding from a vast, intangible, impersonal First Principle, self existent, self-developing, the mother of all things. The operation of this creative principle fulfilled in ihe nature of man, the highest development of which again is to be sought for in a return through quietism\" and 'non action \" to the mother principle. The highest good, accordingly, is to be enjoyed in a transcendental abstraction from worldly cares, or freedom from mental perturbation. In a doctrine such as this it is not difficult to trace at least a superficial likeness to the theories of Brahmanism, and whether originally derived from Hindu thought or not, it is pro bable that the cultivation of Lao Tsze's teachings had a patent influence in preparing the way for an influx of the metaphysical speculations of Indian philosophers, to satisfy a mental craving not provided for in the simple materialism which Confucius expounded. At least, the latitude allowed by the vagueness of Lao Tsze's writings, both enabled and en couraged his so-called disciples and adherents, to graft upon the leading notions of his text, an entirely adventitious code of natural and psychical philosophy, which, on the one hand, expanded into a system of religious belief, a simple travesty of Buddhism, and on the other became developed"], [145, "Pt. I. CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. 113 into a school of mysticism, founded apparently upon the early secrets of the professions of healing and divination, from whence it rose to occult researches in the art of transmuting metals into gold and ensuring longevi ty or admission into the ranks of the genii, (see Tan 77\" and Li Shao kiin). To all these professions and pretensions the title of the religion or teachings of Tao was given, although they were in reality in no wise countenanced by the doctrines of Lao Tsze himself. His professed disciples, Lieh Tsze and Chwang Tsze, in tbe 4th century, and Hwai Nan Tsze, in the 2nd century B.C., progressively developed the mystic element thus introduced, and a notable impetus accrued to it from the superstitious belief with which the pretensions of the alchemists were received by the emperor Wu Ti, from whose period onward the reverence paid to the founder of the sect began to assume a divine character. The emperors of the T'ang dynasty in especial delighted in exalting his memory by means of spiritual attributes. In A.D. 666, Kao Tsung canonized him with the title JL. <\u00bb jfc Ig 'jj-j*, when for the first time he was ranked among the gods, as Great Supreme, the Emperor (or Imperial god), of the Dark First Cause.

In later years he maintained a bold defence against the invasion of his country by the forces of Ts'in, and the latter owed its final victory to a stratagem by which the dreaded champion was removed. The prince of Ts'in prevailed upon a minion of the prince of Chao to persuade his master that Li Muh entertained a treasonable design, and he was consequently superseded in his command.

The most widely celebrated among the poets of China, \u2014 a distinction earned no less by his erratic genius and romantic career than by his powers of versification. Remotely connected by descent with the sovereigns of the T'ang dynasty, he was born and brought up in a remote district of the extreme West \u2014 the modern Sze-ch'wan \u2014 where his family had been settled. It is related of his mother that before giving birth to her child she dreamt that the planet Venus {Tai-peh, also called -g^ Jpjf \u00a3e.\\ shot down from heaven and entered her bosom, from which circumstance the future poet derived his cognomen and designation.

The Emperor himself handed dishes to him at a banquet, required his favorite and haughty concubine to attend the poet with the materials of writing, and called upon his chief eunuch and privy counsellor Kao Li-sze to divest him of his boots when overcome with wine. The hostility of the Emperor's female favourite barred tho doors of official promotion against him, in revenge for some satirical allu- sions detected in his verses, and he led for the remander of his life a wan- dering existence, celebrating in continual flights of verse the praises of bacchanalian enjoyment and of the beauties of nature in tbe various localities he visited. Towards the end of his career he became involved in more than one of the seditious movements undertaken against the government of Hiian Tsung, and twice or thrice narrowly escaped the penalty of death, which on one occasion was commuted for banishment to the wild region bordering on modern Yiin-nan. Relieved from proscription in his old age, he retired to a refuge afforded him by a kinsman, Li Yang-ping |py $Jv, the governor of Tang-t'u gj Hj, (near modern \u25a0-Nanking), under whose protection he died, and who collected and edited his poems. 363 \u2014 Li Peh-yo If *|||.

His propositions were remitted to the council, and were strongly condemned by Li Sze, who advocated a complete rup ture with the past ; and commenting upon the obstinate adherence shewn by the so-called scholars or literati, to ancient precedents, regardless of present needs, he recommended that all possessors of the writings handed down from antiquity, including the books of History and Poetry, be requir ed under severe penalties to surrender them in order that they might be destroyed. The only exemption granted was in favour of works relating to medicine, divination, and agriculture. This plan was carried into effect with unsparing rigour, and in the following year some 460 recalcitrant scholars were put to death. Notwithstanding this proscription, however, copies of the chief works of antiquity, more or less mutilated, were even tually recovered in the following century. Li Sze was himself a well- taught scholar, and is the reputed inventor of the form of writing known as the yj>* g|\u00a3 or lesser seal character. On the death of his imperial master in B.C. 210 he became a partner in the conspiracy which seated the unworthy Hu Hai upon the throne ; but he was not long permitted by Chao Kao, the ambitious eunuch, to continue in the position of chief minister, and being hurled from power by the latter's intrigues, he was at last put to death in public with frightful barbarity. 369.\u2014 Li Sze-yuan E^5 |Jj| 'jjjgf- (Ming Tsung of the After T'ang dynasty).

In many respects the career of this famous sovereign bears a likeness to that of Louis XV. of France.

In his second year, he issued a sumptuary decree prohibiting the extravagant costliness of apparel which was in fashion, and set an example by causing a bonfire to be made in his palace of a vast heap of embroidered garments and jewelry. Under the influence of the wise counsels of Chang Yiieh, Chang Kiu-ling, and other ministers, his administration of the empire prospered, and divers reforms were introduced ; but as time rolled on, the emperor, satiated with the pleasures of rule, lapsed by degrees into a craving for ease and sensual enjoyment. The crafty courtier Li Lin-fu, encouraged these longings with a view to his own aggrandizement, and the passion which the emperor conceived in 734, for the princess Yang, the consort of one of his sons, marked the commencement of an era of infamy and extravagance, which led at length to universal disorganization. In 742, the designation was adopted as the title of the 30th year of the emperor's reign, and about this time a Turkish minion of the court, named Ngan Lu-shan q. v., grew into high favour. The govern ment was soon abandoned into his hands, and wielded under the influence of the three sisters Yang, who with their brother Yang Kwoh-chung, had obtained complete control over the emperor's enfeebled will. See Yang Kwei-fei. A revolt was at length undertaken by Ngan Ln-shan, and the empire was shortly in a blaze of insurrection, the aged author of these calamities being driven from his capital and forced to take refuge in the extreme West of China, undergoing the misery of seeing his male and female favourites butchered before his eyes (A.D. 756).

The apochryphal --^ or Books 'of Chow, which probably date from some centuries before the Christian era, contain an asser tion that the emperor Muh (see Muh Wang), in his famous journeyings (B.C. 985) was entertained by Si Wang Mu at the Lake of Gems in the West ; and a similar statement occurs in the Annals of the Bamboo Books. (Cf. L O, ni., proleg., p. 150). An obscure reference to Si Wang Mu is also to be found in the Shan Hat King; and upon these ancient notices the philosopher Lieh Tsze based, in the 5th century B.C., a fanciful and per haps allegorical tale of the entertainment with which King Muh was honoured and enthralled by the suprnatural being. In later ages, the superstitious vagaries of Han Wu Ti gave rise to innumerable fables res pecting the alleged visits paid to that monarch by Si Wang Mu and her fairy troop ; and the imagination of the Taoist writers of the ensuing centuries was exercised in glowing descriptions of the magnificence of her mountain-palace. (See Kw'en-lun). Here, by the borders of the Lake of Gems Jjg yjtt; grows the peachtree of the genii 'j}Ij (See T'ao), whose fruit confers the gift of immortality, which the goddess bestows upon the favoured beings admitted to her presence ; and hence she despatches the azure winged birds (see Ts'ing Niao) who serve (like the doves of Venus) as her attendants and messengers.

Wisely resolving to break with the traditions of the past, where experience shewed them to be inimical to progress and to substantial imperial control, he swept away the feudal institutions by means of which the sovereigns of Chow had divested themselves of the cares of government, and divided the Empire, including the vast extensions he bad annexed toward the South, into 36 governments or provinces thus effecting a revolution which, after a lapse of 2000 years, history has seen repeated in Japan. At the same time he decreed a change in the imperial title, abolishing the practice of bestowing posthumous designations Jgj* upon each ruler in succes sion. Combining the appellations J\u00a7l (sovereign) and *r*fj* (divine ruler or deity) which historical legends attributed to the Three Hwang and Five Ti of ancient limes, he assumed the title She Hwang-ti (the First Hwang-ti), as his own unalterable designation, ordaining that his successors should be known as the Second, the Third, and so forth even to tho ten-thousandth generation.\" From this period, history records a life of restless activity on his part, becoming more and more marked by vast, ambitious undertakings (conquest of territory from the Hiung-nu, erection of the Great Wall, etc. See Meng T'ien), and deeply tinged by superstition.

According to his autobiography, with which his work, the JJJ gj*. or \" Historical Records,\" is concluded, he was born at Lung Men P*^, (in modern Ho-nan), and was devoted to study in early youth. At the age of 20, he entered upon a course of travel to all parts of the Empire, and in later life became a subordinate official, until, on his father's death, he took up the latter's work as recorder and astronomer, aster the expiry of three years, devoted to mourning. In B.C. 98, he incurred the displeasure of Wu Ti, by extenuating the conduct of Li LiDg q. v., after the latter's defeat by the Hiung-nu, and history records that he was hereupon thrown into prison and subjected to the punishment of castration. During eight years subsequent to this disgrace, he occupied himself with the completion of his historical undertaking, which he is believed to have concluded in B.C. 91.

Pt. I. philosophorum, the mystical compound by means of which the Taoist alchemists professed themselves able to produce gold and to confer the gift of immortality. These pretensions existed as early as the third century B.C. (see Lu Sheng, Li Shao Kiin, and Liu Ngan), and were largely developed in the centuries immediately succeeding the Christian era. It seems probable that the science of alchemy was originally derived by the Arabs from a Chinese source, and that the Kin tan is the true progenitor of the philosopher's stone or powder of transmutation sought after by enthusiasts in all the lands of Europe. (Cf. Phases in, the developement of Tauism, by the Rev. Joseph Edkins, Art. IV., Trans. of the Hongkong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1855). Beside its specific meaning, Tan was employed in the mystical language of the Taoist philosophers to denote in general all the processes, both psychical and physical, which they inculcated. They named the material substance constituting their elixir *i\\> yr wax tan, (external), and the menial process of sublimation by means of which the body became freed from all the impurity of earth and worthy of admission among the immortal ranks of the genii, p^ yj (internal). The process in either case was termed J||jip yj. This term refers to the mineral which formed the basis of all the magic compounds prepared by the Taoist doctors, viz., the tan sha yj or \u2022fj/jc Yy, which is identified with cinnabar or red sulphuret of mercury . (Cf. Hanbury, Notes on Chinese Materia Medico).

Among the countless mystical phrases connected with the preparation of the elixir one of the most frequent is the following : yl^ jg ft, \u2014 the drug produced (returned), after nine revolutions. This is explained as denoting the gradual evolution of the elixir during nine successive months of preparation. (Cf. T. S. K., k. 43 p. 15). According lo the fi^L fjffi of T'ao Hung-king q. v., the divine elixir of nine revolutions yfj jpgi jpljj I , caused those who swallowed it to become transformed into white cranes. (See Ho).

His faithful emissary King K'o q v. undertook the attempt to assassinate the Sovereign of Ts'in ; but, on this failing, the forces of Ts'in were directed against the State of Yen, whereupon the father of Tan, in a vain endeavour to conciliate the enemy, put his son to death.

From the above quotation, Chinese usage has adopted the phrase ~f' {j|gf to denote the marriage of a bride. Still more prominent is the position given to the peach tree in the mystical fancies of tbe Taoists. The most ancient superstitions of the Chinese attributed magic virtues to the twigs of the peach (see T'u Yii) ; and the fatulists of the Han dynasty added many extravagant details to the legends already existing. They described the jfllfl J , or peach-tree of the gods as yield ing the fruit of immortality ; and especially was this the case with the tree which grew near the palace of Si Wang Mu q. v., and whose fruit ripened but once in 3000 years. The fairy queen bestowed its produce only upon such favoured mortals as her imperial votaries Muh Wang and Wu Ti qq.v.

A celebrated statesman, renowned by the sagacity he displayed in the govern- ment of various provinces. It is related of him that as a boy, when fishing in the gg y!p Lake, his net brought up a weaver's shuttle, which he carried to his home and hung up against the wall, but which immediately was transformed into a dragon and disappeared. As a young man, living with his mother in a state of .poverty, he was much embarrassed by the arrival one day of a grandee who claimed shelter and refreshment under his roof; and he was enabled to shew hospitality only by the aid of his mother's devotion. She cut off her hair and sold it to obtain a jar of wine, and cut up the straw matting of the house to feed the visitor's horse. This circumstance becoming known, led to his advancement. Shortly before entering public life, he dreamt that he scaled the heights of heaven with the aid of eight wings, and passed through eight of the celestial doors, but was driven back from the ninth by the warder, who cast him down to earth, where the wings on his left side were broken. This dream was subsequently held to have been realized by his filling the post of Governor of eight provinces. Before attaining to high office, he was at one time superintendent of public fishponds, and he then sent to his mother a present of dried fish from this source ; but she returned it with a rebuke for his breach of trust in sending her the property of the State. When governor of Kwang Chow he was accustomed to occupy a portion of his leisure in carrying a hundred bricks morning and evening to and from his study l|Jj *H W HI 51-f et,Cl' to keeP* as ke saia h's bodily powers in exercise, in order that his mental faculties might continue unimpaired.

Her boldness and filial devotion so touched the Emperor that he pardoned Ch'un-yii I and abolished the penalty of mutilation, the injustice of which, as urged by the intrepid maiden, was for the first time recognized and condemned. 7 1 8.\u2014 T'ieh Kwai Sien-sheng $|{ % \u00c6 0ue of the legendary patriarchs included by the Taoist writers in the category of the /v lUli or Eight Immortals. No precise period is assigned to his existence upon earth. He is said to have been named Li -fp:, and to have been of commanding stature and dignified mien, devoting himself wholly to the study of Taoist lore. In this he was instructed by tbe sage Lao Tsze him self, who at times descended to earth and at times was used to summon his pupil to interviews with him in the celestial spheres. On one occasion, when about to mount on high at his patron's bidding, the pupil, before departing in spirit to voyage through the air, left a disciple of his own to watch over his material soul (|p*[|), with the command that if, after seven days had expired, his spirit (ZJg) did not return, the material essence might be dismissed into space. Unfortunately, when six days had expired, the watcher was called away to the death bed of his mother, and his trust being neglected, when the disembodied spirit returned on the evening of the seventh day, it found its earthly habitation no longer vitalized. It there fore entered the first available refuge, which was the body of a lame and crooked beggar whose spirit had at that moment been exhaled ; and in this shape the philosopher continued his existence, supporting his halting footsteps with an iron staff. 7 1 9.\u2014 T'ien Ch'ang g} A noble of the State of Ts'i, 5th century B.C.

When the time seemed favourable for striking a blow at the beleaguering army, in B.C. 279, he had recourse to an elaborate stratagem for the enemy's destruction. Collecting a host of oxen within the city he fastened swords to their horns and tied bunches of reeds greased with fat to their tails ; whereupon, setting fire to the reeds, he suddenly drove them against the besiegers, who were routed in great confusion. He followed up this success so vigorously as to recover the whole of the territories of Ts'i, and having installed the rightful Sovereign on the throne was rewarded with the feudal title of 2p Jg. 733.\u2014 T'ien Ting j^ \"J\".

The Hare, {Lepus sinensis). This animal is reputed as deriving its origin from the vital essence of the Moon, to the influence of which luminary it is consequently subject. Chang Hwa, in tbe ijffl (fy) $?*, asserts that the hare conceives by gazing at the Moon ; though earlier writers have alleged that the female hare becomes with"], [251, "Pu I. CHINESE READERS MANUAL. 219 young by licking the fur of the male. She is said to produce her young from the month. Like the fox, the hare attains tho age of 1000 years, and becomes white when half that period is completed. The red hare 7jf\\ j is a supernatural beast of auspicious omen, which appears when virtuous rulers govern the Empire. Tradition earlier than the period of tbe Han dynasty asserted that a hare inhabited the surface of the Moon, and later Taoist fable depicted this animal, called 35 ] the gemmeous hare (see Yii), as the servitor of the genii, who employ it in pounding the drugs which compose the elixir of life. \u2014 T'u Yiian I |]g|, the Hare Garden, was the name given by Prince Hiao of Liang to the pleasure grounds in which he sought recreation surrounded by a retinue of scholars. The con- nection established in Chinese legend between the hare and the moon is probably traceable to an Indian original. In Sanskrit inscriptions the Moon is named Sason, from a fancied resemblance of its spots to a leveret ; and pandits, to whom maps of the Moon's surface have been shewn, have fixed on Loca Paludosa and Mons Porphyrites or Keplerus and Aristarchus for the spots which they think exhibit the similitude of a hare. (H. T. Colebrooke, in Asiatic Researches, Vol. IY., London 1809, p. 404). Ac- cording to De Gubernatis {Zoological Mythology, Vol. II., p. 76), the mythical hare is undoubtedly the moon. In Sanskrit tbe means properly the leaping one, as well as the bare, the rabbit, and the spots on the moon (tbe saltans), which suggest the figure of a hare.\" Cf. also H. M. p. 422, for a mention of the hare in the moon in Buddhist legends.

Having attracted by bis literary merit the notice of Ow-yang Siu, q. v., he was advanced by this Minister to a judicial office, and after serving with dis- tinction in various posts he was raised in A.D. 1060, by an Imperial Mandate to one of the principal offices in connection with the administra- tion of justice. Although more than once summoned to Court by the Emperor Ying Tsung, he constantly excused himself as being unworthy to offer advice to the Sovereign, \u2014 an excess of humility the sincerity of which is doubted by historians. In 1007, having been appointed Prefect of Kiang-ning, he was for the first time presented to the Emperor ; whose successor, Shen Tsung, on ascending the Throne in the following year, .lmost immediately chose Wang Ngan-shih, as his most intimate counsellor and placed him a sew months afterwards at the head of affairs. The theories on government which Wang Ngan-shih had elaborated during many years of study now received a rapid development, and be was bailed for a time by all but a few cautious politicians as a heaven-sent regenerator of society. The Emperor, adroitly flattered by comparisons between him- self and the wise rulers of antiquity, allowed Wang Ngan-shib, to monopolize authority and to introduce his administrative schemes despite all opposition. The ground work of his theory of government appears to have consisted in an extension of the duties of administration to a degree previously unknown in the Chinese system, but justified, in his eyes, by the political institutions recorded in the j^) fljjf, or State Regulations of the Chow dynasty, which he adopted as his model. Under his influence, a commission was appointed to draw up a fresh edition of the classical texts, with the object of substituting for former commentaries the views which Wang Ngan-shih was desirous of supporting ; and at the same lime new departments of government were created to carry into effect the"], [276, "Ft.

Whatever benefit might have accrned to the agricultural classes from the system of government loans, was wholly neutralized through the rapacity and villany of the underlings and satellites into whose hands the disbursement of the advances and the collection of interest lapsed, distress and impoverishment taking the place of the expected advantages lo the people ; whilst on the part of the State, vast sums were irrecoverably lost Tbe enrolment system, also, speedily proved a burden through the exactions to which it gave rise, and the injustice frequently entailed by the responsibility for the offences of others which was laid collectively upon all the members of each Fpl or tything. These and other revolutionary schemes were vigoriously opposed by the great Minister Sze-ma Kwang, although at the outset he had been blinded to Wang Ngan-shih's faults by the brilliancy of his genius, as also by Su She, Han K'i, and other statesmen ; but he nevertheless continued to wield an almost boundless influence throughout the reign of Shen Tsung. No sooner had the latter, however, vacated the Throne (A.D. 1085), than Sze ma Kwang rose into power, superseding Wang Ngan-shih, and shortly before the ex-Minister's death he saw the whole of his system of legislation condemned and repealed.

The Empress Wu, by whom the government of China was usurped during tbe latter half of the seventh century. Originally named Wu Chao ] J*Jf\u00bb, the daughter of a man of low station, she became one of the inferior concubines yjs' J\\ of the Emperor T'ai Tsung of the T'ang dynasty, on whose death in A.D. 649, she retired to a Buddhist nunoery, where, still at an early age, she assumed the monastic garb and vows. Here, a few years later, she was observed by the Emperor Kao Tsung, who had already noticed her while an occupant of his father's seraglio. Kao Tsung's Empress, anxious at the time to destroy the influence of a favoured concubiue, and having discovered her consort's fancy for the youthful nun, took the latter from her retreat and introduced her into the palace. Once reestablished at Court, the ad- venturess speedily contrived to engross the monarch's admiration, and in A.D. 654, she was raised to the rank of Chao I j}[j \"j^, and recognized as prime favourite. In the following year tbe Empress was deposed in order to make way for her quondam protege'e, and from this moment the latter's influence over the Emperor and in State affairs continued only to increase. To gratify her vindictive desires more than one of the most eminent public servants was sent to execution, and changes were liberally introduced to suit her tastes in the institutions and ceremonial of the Empire. In A.D. 674, she raised her nephew Wu Ch'eng-sze jE\u00a3 7\u00a3i |0g, to tho rank of Duke of Chow ffl ||jt| whilst the Emperor and herself assumed re spectively the titles J\u00a7l and f^ or Emperor and Empress of Heaven. On the death of Kao Tsung in A.D. 683, he was succeeded by one of his sons, a feeble youth (known in history as Chung Tsung), who contentedly resigned the powers of government into the hands of the Empress-dowager a month after his accession to the throne. The Empress, relegating the actual Sovereign to a state of virtual confinement, with the title of Prince of Lu Ling j|I[ Jig? jJl, hereupon assumed the full at tributes of supreme power, which she continued to wield triumphantly for"], [289, "Pt. I. CHINESE READERS MANUAL. 257 nearly twenty years. Her despotic rule was maintained with pitiless cruelty, statesman after statesmau falling a victim to her resentment or caprice ; but at the same time she was careful to uphold the external interests of the Empire, the boundaries of which she enlarged whilst gaining a fresh hold on the allegiance of the neighbouring nations. Regardless of remon strance, she introduced sweeping changes in the ordinances and practice of government, and even sought to signalize her reign by altering the form of some of the most familiar written characters of the language ; whilst her contempt for criticism was manifested in the free access to her private apart ments which she granted to the Buddhist priest Hwai I '||\u00a7 -=gg. Aster a course of action extending over many years which gave rise to the sus picion that she cherished a design of totally supplanting the dynasty of T'ang, she at length threw off all disguise, and having put to death a great number of the off-shoots of the Imperial family, she proclaimed herself in A.D. 690, \"Emperor\" Jf \"0* ofthe Chow jf] dynasty. She at the same time adopted one of the Imperial Princes as her heir, giving him her own surname, Wu, and assumed the full attributes recognized as pertaining to a change of dynasty. It was not until the infirmities of age had over taken the vigorous frame and sapped the commanding intellect of this extraordinary woman that any effectual attempt was made to subvert her power. After some years of threatened revolt, a military conspiracy was at length organized, which, in A.D! 705, succeeded in wresting the govern ment from the hands of the Empress, whereupon the rightful Sovereign was called from his seclusion and placed upon the Throne. Even in her down fall, however, the Empress retained a portion of the influence and respect she had been habituated to command. She was endowed with a palatial residence, and the title @lj yZ yZ JH. Hi* was assioIieu' to -ter, whilst for the few remaining months of her life she was treated with high consideration by the Sovereign whom she had so long dispossessed.

The youthful Sovereign signalized the commencement of his reign by an enthusiastic patronage of literature, and under his auspices the newly recovered Confucian writings were diligently studied by Tung Chung-shu q. v., and his colleagues. In B.C. 136, the first literary degrees were instituted, with the title 3l |^ '|'|| -\\\" \u25a0 whilst at the same epoch the influence of the Empire began to make itself felt among the fierce nomads of the Northern frontier and at the Court of the then independent ruler of South-eastern China. Notwith standing his early proclivities in favour of the Confucian literature, Wu Ti speedily betrayed a leaning toward the professors of magic and superstitious rites, \u2014 cf. Numbers 365 and 342 ; and sensual passion was at the same time indulged with more than ordinary license. This twofold development ofthe Imperial character gave rise, most probably, to the traditions which in a subsequent age recounted the amours of Wu Ti with his fairy visitor, Si Wang Mu, q. v. A galaxy of courageous and enterprising generals carried the arms of Wu Ti into the heart of Central Asia, \u2014 cf. Li Kwang-li, Chang K'ien, etc. ; and with sundry vicissitudes, the formidable Hiung-nu, were successfully held in check on the northwestern frontiers. In B.C. 130, the. tribes occupying the region of modern Yiin-nan were also brought under subjection. In B.C. 104, a change of calendar, in accord ance with the calculations of Sze-ma Ts'ien q. v., was introduced, and forms the epoch with which the modern period of Chinese chronology begins. The concluding years of Wu Ti's reign were distinguished by a series of gorgeous Imperial journeys, having as their object the performance of sacrificial rites at different mountain-shrines ; and they were also dis graced by the proscriptions aud judicial murders instigated by tbe Princess Kow Yih, \u2014 see No. 278.

A large portion of the northwestern territory of China remained at this time, as for several centuries previously, in the power of the Wei dynasty, and despite continual warfare, Wu Ti was unable to extend his sovereignty in that direction ; but from Kien K'ang (the modern Nanking), he ruled with great ability and splendour over Southern and Eastern China. He professed an ardent reverence for the tenets of Bud dhism, and extended warm patronage to the professors of this faith, including missionaries who during his reign were attracted from India to his dominions. On repeated occasions, he took up his abode in Buddhist monasteries and assumed the religious garb. Toward the end of a long and glorious reign the Emperor's power began to suffer attack on the part of insurgent chieftains, and his lineage was extinguished very shortly after his decease. 864. \u2014 Wu Kang -^ pfjj)).\u2014 The Man in the Moon.

After the act of suicide was accomplished his corpse was sewn in a leathern wine-sack, and cast into the river near the present city of Soochow.

Three years later, on the death of the then Imperial favourite, the ministers to Ming Hwang's pleasures cast their eyes upon the lovely Princess Yang. No sooner had the Emperor obtained a sight of his daughter in-law than, violently enamoured, he caused her to be enrolled among the ladies of his seraglio, bestowing in exchange another consort on his son. The Taoist fancies in which the voluptuous monarch took delight were manisfested in the designation he bestowed upon his new favourite, who was henceforth named the lady T'ai Chen tj\u00a3 Ip\u00a3, in reminiscence of one of the daughters assigned in mystic fable to the goddess Si Wang Mu. Before a year had elapsed, so great an ascendancy had been gained in the harem by Yang T'ai-chen, that she obtained from the entire Court and from the Emperor himself demonstrations of respect such as justly appertain to none bnt the Empress Consort. In A.D. 745 she was raised to the rank of Kwei Fei p| jflj, a title second in dignity to that of Empress only, -and year after year saw the Emperor more and more deeply sunk in the toils of amorous dalliance. In this pernicious course he was encouraged by the corrupt Ministers and sinister favourites under whose influence the affairs of State had passed ; and with their consent the entire family of Yang Kwei-fei participated in tbe favours that were prodigally lavished upon herself.

No outlay was spared in gratifying the caprices or the covetousness of this family of favourites. Tributary kingdoms were ransacked for gems to enhance the adornments they displayed at innumerable festivals, and whole districts were wrung with exactions for the purpose of meeting the frequent demands made by the Princesses and their connexions on the palace treasury. For the delectation of Yang Kwei-fei in particular, relays of couriers were employed during the early summer in transporting to Ch'ang-ngan from the southern provinces supplies of the fruit called the li-che iffij 7^, of which she was immoderately fond, and in this duty great numbers of the serfs who were employed as runners fell victims to excessive exertion. The Emperor's unworthy minion, Ngan Luh-shan, q. v., was admitted to participate in the revels of the Emperor and his bevy of concubines, nor did the scandals which hence became bruited abroad in any degree abate the Emperor's infatuation.

The same writer observes that y\u00a3 fja (the \" great and pure \") is another name for the jade-stone ; and that by swallowing a portion of it men may attain to the slate of incor poreality and the power of soaring through the air \u2014 \u00a3f *$\u00a3 J\\fe :lp:.

The Moon is consequently regarded as chief and director of everything subject in the cosmic system to the Yin y\u00a7\u00a3 principle, such as darkness, the eartb, female creatures, water, &c.

The Emperor is said to \" call the Sun his elder brother and the Moon his sister\" A i 5L H $* M (Cf.S.L.F. art yiieh). In the writings of Hwai-nan Tsze the presiding genius of the Moon is said to be named Wang Shu 3^ ffi or Sien 0 -^ |JpJ\".

According to De Gubernatis, (Zoological Mythology, Vol. n, p. 375), the frog, which in certain hymns of the Rig Veda typifies the clouds, is \" also identified with the pluvial Moon.\" The earliest Chinese mythological -writers convey a similar idea. Chang Heng q.v., in his work entitled Ling Hien, narrates that \" When How I (see No. 178) besought from Si Wang Mu the drug of immortality, Heng Ngo (see No. 94) stole it and fled to the mansion of the Moon for refuge, where she was transformed into a frog {Chan-chu). Sundry marvel lous stories are narrated by Pao P'uh Tsze and other fabulists of the lon gevity of this creature, its attributes, &c. ; and a further approximation of the Chinese to the Hindoo or Aryan myth in this respect is to be noted in the name which has been assigned to it. Whilst the character, rank ing under the radical suggests to the eye an association with what we term the insect tribe, the Urh Ya, the most ancient of Chinese dictionaries, describes the chan-chu as a creature like the hia-mo ffipj |M or frog, and this latter we find classed in immediate relationship with the cricket and the grasshopper. Here we encounter the notion expressed, according to De Gubernatis, in the Latin proverb rana cum gryllo ; \u2014 the frog and the grasshopper being identified with each other on account of their shrill"], [321, "Pi.

The singular form of development undergone by the frog, resembling that of certain species of insects, may have given rise to this confusion; but the diversity with which the sound chan-chu (or tu), is represented affords reason to suspect that its origin was foreign. It can scarcely be doubted that the legend presented by Chang Heng in the 1st century B.C., was derived from the same source with that existing among the ancient Hindoos.

The combinations of triple lines, believed to have been developed by Fuh-hi (see Part I, No. 146 and 177) by aid of a plan or arrangement of figures revealed to him on the back of a dragon-horse.\" They consist in the following delineations : \u2014 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. These figures or trigrams, consisting alternately of whole and broken lines, are reducible to the Four symbols, (see ante, No 107), which consist in but two lines each, and these again to their two primary forms (see ante, No. 3), which represent the first division or development of the Tin and Yang from Unity or the Ultimate Principle. According to the Chinese belief, these eight figures, together with the sixty-four combinations to which they are extended (see below), accompanied by certain presumptive explanations attributed to Fuh-hi, were the basis of an ancient system of philosophy and divination during the centuries preceding the era of Wen Wang (12th century B.C.), but of which no records have been preserved beyond the traditional names of its schools or divisions. (See ante, No. 73.) Wen Wang (see Pait I, No. 856), while undergoing imprisonment at the hands of the tyrant Show, devoted himself to study of the diagrams, and appended to each of them a short explanatory text. These explanations,"], [366, "CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. Ft. II. 334 entitled Jyi;, with certain further observations on the strokes of the figures, termed JK., which are attributed to Chow Kung, the son of Wen Wang, constitute the work known as j\u00a7] or the Book of changes of the Chow dynasty, which, with the commentary added by Confucius, forms the Yih King jyj jjS^, the most venerated of the Chinese classics. (Cf. W.N. p. 1.) In this work, which serves as basis for the philosophy of divination and geomancy, and is largely appealed to as containing not alone the elements of all metaphysical knowledge but also a clue to the secrets of nature and of being, tbe eight diagrams upon which the entire system reposes are named as follows, accompanied by indications of their alleged relation to the elements or constituent parts of existence : 1. !j{\u00a3i, corresponding to Heaven, the celestial expanse; and, being entirely composed of whole lines, to jjStJ y\u00a7y or the unalloyed male principle. 2. 5jj, corresponding to vapour, watery exhalations, lakes. 3- ljfi, corresponding to fire and heat, light. 4. |=|, corresponding to thunder. 5. j*p|, corresponding to wind 6. jfc, corresponding to water. 7. Js**., corresponding to mountains. 8. i^, corresponding to Earth, or terrestrial matter ; and, being wholly composed of broken lines, to *$j|J $&, or the unalloyed female principle. A ceaseless process of revolution is held to be at work, in tbe course \u2022of which the various elements or properties of nature indicated by the diagrams mutually extinguish and give birth to one another, thus producing the phenomena of existence. The following plan, devised by the philos ophers of the Sung dynasty, represents the supposed natural order ( Jj^ \"fj\u00a3), of arrangement which the diagrams occupy as indicators of the unseen revolution of the powers of nature : \u2014"], [367, "CHINESE READERS MANUAL. Pt. II. 335 To this arrangement, considered as representing the scheme imagined by Fuh-hi, the title y}Z yZ is given, in conformity with the teachings of Ch'en Tw'an (see Part I., No. 104a) ; whilst a different order of succession, imagined by Shao Yung (see Part I., No. 594), as that indicated by tho teachings of Wen Wang, is designated -\u00a3g yZ, these terms, implying at once priority and consecutiveness in date and a different position of the yz symbol, having been adopted from a passage in the Confucian commentary. The -l\u00a3g Hn, or posterior arrangement is as follows : \u2014 Upon the procession and introaction of the diagrams in one or other of these orders of arrangement divers systems of divination and metaphysical exegesis have been based. The qualities attributed to each of the elemen tary principles represented by the diagrams play an important part in these speculations. They are described as follows : |f\u00a3j is $g| \u2014 strong ; i^ is |)P \u2014 complaint ; j\u00a7j is Ijjf \u2014 mobile ; Jpj is y\\ \u2014 penetrating ; i^"], [368, "Pt.

By a process of comparison, a certain animal, typifying these qualities, is assigned to each diagram (see post, No. 259). In addition to the series of eight trigrams described above, Fuh-hi, or some one of his successors, is held to have enlarged the basis of calculation by multiplying the original number eightfold, thus creating the y^ ~y* |7tj \u2014 Sixtyfour diagrams or Hexagrams. This is accomplished by duplicating each of the original trigrams with itself and the remaining seven, forming combinations such as the following:\u2014* = =^== and so on to the end. A sixfold multiplication of these again gives the 384 completing the number to which the diagrams are practically carried, although it is maintained that by a further process of multiplication a series of 16,777,216 different forms may be produced. and J0j m Ejfj >||B by Hu Wei, passim).

EXPLANATORY NOTE. With reference to the object and scope of the Chronological Tables presented here, the reader is requested to consult the observations offered in the Introduction. The two tables ofthe Chinese cycles, anterior and posterior to the Christian era, furnish the means of reconcih'ng any cyclical date with our own notation of time. Each table is divided into two portions in order to bring it within the limits of an ordinary page ; but the reader will perceive without difficulty that the cyclical characters and the corres ponding dates follow each other in regular succession. The short columns at the head of the tables contain the date of commencement of each cycle, in rotation, followed below by the years in successive order. Thus, for instance, >y ~f\" was the combination denoting the years A.D, 4, 301, 604, &c, down to 1804, and the following combination 2j 3J corresponds to A.D. 5, 305, 665, &c, down to 1805. In the next column a second period is commenced, comprising all the cycles beginning with the years shown in the index column at the top. For example, if we desire to ascertain the date according to our era of an event occurring \" in the year ting hai J of Wu Ti of the Tsin Dynasty,\" we find on consulting the historical tables that Wu Ti's reign com menced A.D. 265, and turning to the table of cycles, it is found that a cyclical period commenced in A.D. 244 and must therefore have embraced -within its course the reign of Wu Ti. Fixing A.D. 265, the first of his reign, as the year yi yeo Zj W of tho cycle, we follow the column of characters down until we reach ting hai, and at once identify this combination, on reference to the column of years, as A.D. 267. On the other hand, in the course of Chinese reading a reference may be met with entailing the verification ofthe \"3rd year of Wu Ti ofthe Tsin dynasty.\" On turning to the page ofthe Tables comprising the Tsin Dynasty, A.D. 265 is found to be the first year of Wu Ti's reign, and it becomes obvious that the 3rd year corresponds to A.D. 267. If, however, in lieu of referring to this sovereign by his miao hao or posthumous title the Cliinese historian has spoken of the \"3rd year of T'ai She ofthe Tsin dynasty,\" it will be found on consulting the Tables that T'ai She was the first of three successive nien hao or epochal designations adopted during the course of Wu Ti's reign, and that tbe ear 267 is still indicated. y"], [394, "362 CHINESE READERS MANUAL.

Pi. III. INTRODUCTION.\u2014 THE FABULOUS AGES. It is probable that ancient Chinese writers, of a period antecedent to the foundation of the Han dynasty, indulged an exuberant fancy in the enumeration of long lines of dynastic rulers, to occupy the myriads of ages which, it was fabled, had elapsed since the powers of Heaven and Earth had first united to produce Man as the possessor of the soil of China. Speculations of this nature, embodied in works such as the JC wR cL now no longer in existence, were reproduced in the Chronology of the Han dynasty, gj| f& /$\u00a3>, where it is asserted that \" from creation to the capture of the lin in the days of Confucius (B.C. 48l) a period elapsed of 2,267,000 and odd years, divided into ten jpj* or epochs.\" In a still later age the number of years embraced by this period was stated (in Sze-ma Cheng's commentary on the Sze Ki) as extending to 3,276,000. The ten epochs are enumerated as follows : \u2014 1. HI. $1* 5 a'so ter;me(*l lhe fy J|l T^ji and the fy ]0| *${\u00a3.

Of the first of the above epochs it is narrated that the founder of the line of rulers was P'an Ku, the first created being, (see Part I., No. 672), who was followed by a line of descendants constituting three families or brotherhoods, viz., Jz J\u00a7. J*^, lhe family of sovereigns of Heaven, \u2014 12 brothers; \u00a3& j\u00a7| J^, the family of sovereigns of Earth, \u2014 11 brothers; and J\\ j|l j^, the family of sovereigns of Humankind, \u2014 9 brothers ; who separately ruled over the Nine Divisions [of the Empire]. The five rulers of the 2nd epoch are severally designated as l|l *fy, J -fib j ;$-{, [ and j As, {i. e., eldest, second, third, fourth, and youngest"], [397, "Ft. III. CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. 365 sovereign), who have in addition a double set of appellations, following the five notes of the musical scale, as fg, ffg, etc., and the list of the five planets, as f[lj, 'fe fllj, etc. Of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th epochs it is slated that no record exists of tbe rulers' names. The 7lh epoch comprised twenty-two sovereigns, \" whose virtue was so substantial that men followed after (^) their example with celerity like unto that of flight,\" \u2014 whence the designation of the epoch. Their titles have been handed down, but not the number of their generations. The 8th epoch comprised thirteen sovereigns, in whose times institutes were founded \u00a5r\\ 'R T^> which posterity could follow (|JJ) with benefit to the world. The second ruler of this line was Shuh Shan -^gj [J_[, (Mountain of Shuh), who ruled over the region of Shuh (the modern Sze-ch'wan), and taught the people to cultivate the produce of the silkworm which abounded in its forests. He is worshipped UDder the title of pj JJJJjl, or Spirit of the Black [blue, or green] Eobe. After a vast intervening period, the sovereign power was wielded by the following rulers, with whom the less fantastic portion ofthe fabulous period is reputed to commence: \u2014 -^=f J^. Yew Ch'ao (the Nest-having), 2 generations. /Hi yv- Sui \u2022J^11 (t**ae Fire-producer), 4 generations. mt wC' Yung-ch'eng (Service-completed), 8 generations. Succeeding the above came the 9th epoch, deriving its title from the virtue of handing over the throne to a successor, which stands in relation with the principles of heaven.\" The first sovereign of this line is represent ed as having been named Hien Yiian p-f IjjJ, the second Yung Chuh jjj*/J tffy, the third Fuh-hi \"f^ l|c> the fourth j\u00a3* j||, inventor of the art of writing, and so forth for many generations. The 10th epoch owed its names to its faculties of prophetic knowledge and of pronouncing judge ment. It is represented as commencing with gg[ 7}g* Hwang Ti, and is variously made to end with Hia How (Yii) B.C. 2198, or with the Chow dynasty. No actual weight is attached even by Chinese writers to the stale ments, of which the above is a condensed summary, handed down by the fabulists of antiquity regarding prehistoric epochs and dynastic lines. It is only in the next grand division of legendary record \u2014 the age of Yao and Shun and their successors \u2014 that a claim to anything resembling authentic-"], [398, "CHINESE READER'S MANUAL. 366 Pt.

It is convenient, nevertheless, for chronological purposes, to accept the tenth and last of the line of imaginary epochs as that with which the legendary \u2014 as distinct from the purely mythical \u2014 period of Chinese history may be deemed to commence. With Fuh-hi, the reputed founder of tbe Chinese polity, and whose reign is placed in B.C. 2852, the yly fjQ or Legendary History which serves as an introduction to the Annals {Tung Kien) of Sze-ma Kwang, is made to open ; and with him the so-called line or age ofthe Five Eiders is commonly held to have begun.
