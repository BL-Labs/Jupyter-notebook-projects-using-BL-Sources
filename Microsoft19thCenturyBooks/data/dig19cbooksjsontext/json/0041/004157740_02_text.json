Its Domesday state is described as follows : \u2014 \"The same Robert (Fitz Tetbald) holds Chenbritone (of the Earl) : Aluric, Elmer, Uluuin, and Edmer held it (in Saxon times) for four Manors and were Free. Here are in hides geldable.

There is a wood which will fatten 30 swine. In time of King Edward the Manor was worth 28s.; now it is worth 15s.\" (per annum).1 Of Robert Fitz Tetbald's further connection with Kemberton we know nothing more than that he granted the Tithes thereof to Shrewsbury Abbey. This has been already stated under Idsall, where I have also shown that Robert Fitz Tetbald was a much greater man in Sussex than in Shropshire, and that his Fief in the former County consisted of tbe Honour of Petworth, \u2014 an integral portion of the greater Honour of Arundel. When and why Robert Fitz Tetbald's possessions reverted to the Crown is not precisely known. Their redistribution to subjects began in time of Henry I, and was continued in Stephen's reign ; but it is very remarkable with regard to his three Shropshire Manors that each of them was regranted in a way which associates them much more with the Earldom of Arundel and County of Sussex, than with the Earldom of Shrewsbury and County of Shropshire. This fact has been rather suggested than established by our account of Idsall. Its fullest illustration will be furnished by our future notice of Woodcote, which, having been Robert Fitz 1 Domesday, so. 256, b. 2. III. 1"], [18, "2 KEMBERTON. Tetbald's at Domesday, continued for ages a Member of the Honour of Petworth. What we know of Kemberton points also to the same conclusion, but with evidence hardly so complete. I cannot hope to deal satisfactorily with this subject unless I state some principal facts connected with the descent of the Earl dom of Arundel. King Henry I held it, like the Earldom of Shrewsbury, till the day of his death. He held it, chiefly but not wholly, in demesne. Under him some unattainted Feoffees of the Norman Earls retained their Tenures. Others of the forfeited or lapsed estates the King bestowed on his own Favourites. The Honour of Petworth had not yet been regranted to any subject, when the Earldom, of which it was a principal member, passed by the King's death to Adeliza de Lovain, his young and childless Widow, to whom the King had appointed it for dower. She presently became the wife of William de Albini Pincerna, and he in her right became Earl of Arundel, Chichester, or Sussex, \u2014 for by each of those Titles is he described.2 William de Albini and his wife, between the years 1137 and 1154, concurred in granting the Honour of Petworth to Josceline de Lovain, Brother of the Queen Countess, an act which was con firmed by special Charter of Henry Duke of Normandy, and therefore confirmed between 1151 and 1154. Josceline de Lovain, otherwise called \" Josceline Frater Regin\u00e6,\" or \"Josceline the Castellan,\" further increased his fortunes by marrying Agnes, daughter and eventual Coheir of William de Perci. Their joint descendants, under the name of Perci, were heirs not only of the Barony of Perci, but continued to hold the Honour of Petworth under the successive Lords of Arundel. Josceline de Louvain appears to have deceased during some part of the fiscal year which ended Michaelmas 1180. His heirs would seem to have been under age at the time, and for nine years after wards, for the Honour of Petworth was in manu Regis for the whole ten years thus indicated. And this seizure to the Crown, be 2 There is no presumption that either Stephen or the Empress gave to Earl William de Albini any formal grant of nobility, or investiture of this Earldom, though there is much probability that both acquiesced in his assumption of the Title. The decision which at a later period has declared this Earldom to be absolutely an Earldom by Tenure has been much questioned. The very fact of Albini's assuming the Title without creation is however a strong support of that decision. He became Earl by marrying Adeliza, and Adeliza was no otherwise Countess than by tenure of the Honour and Castle of Arundel."], [19, "KEMBERTON. 3 it observed, was not because Petworth was a Tenure in capite, but because the Earldom and greater Honour, of which Petworth was a member, was, during the whole of the said period of ten years, and somewhat more, itself in the King's Custody.3 I must now return to the period of Domesday where I find Heriedeham to have been a member of the Sussex Fief of that Robert whom I have identified as Robert Fitz Tetbald Lord of the Honour of Petworth.4 This place, afterwards called Heringham, Helingham, or Hard ham, is supposed to have been given by Josceline de Lovain to John de Alta Ripa.5 That assumption is probably founded upon truth, but I cannot think it true in all particulars. I neither suppose that John was the name of Josceline de Lovain's Feoffee at Hardham, nor that Josceline granted to him or any other Haute rive the whole of that Manor. Josceline, \" Brother of Queen Adeliza de Arundell\" (as he is styled in this instance), granted to Lewes Priory the Church of Budichton ; and his grant was attested by Robert de Alta Ripa, and by Josceline the Grantor's Nephew.6 A charter, which seems to be nearly coeval with this, is attested by Robert de Alta Ripa, and William his Son.7 One of these, Robert or William, was certainly a Grantee of Josceline the Castellan, not however in a whole Manor like Hardham, but in 15 denariates of land (i. e. land for which the Feoffee paid 15c?. quit-rent) in Hardham or elsewhere. This land William de Alta Ripa was holding at Michaelmas 1189, and nine years' arrears of the said quit-rent were then due, the King not having decided on the collection of several such arrears due from Tenants of the Honour of Petworth. Two other Tenants of that Honour were William Fitz Alan, who held 3 solidates thereof, and Josceline, nephew of Josceline de Lovain, who held 10 librates and 14 solidates? Of William de Alta Ripa it is further related, that in Henry II's time he founded the Augustine Priory of St. George of Hering- ham; to which also Josceline, nephew of the Castellan, granted 3 Rot.

For conceding this Fine, William de Alta Ripa (besides whatever he may have paid the Recognizor) paid the King 10 merks,10 but his quit-rent, amounting to \u00a314. 8s. in the next year and half, seems to have been excused.11 Thus did William de Hauterive, by right or by purchase, become Lord of Hardham, and so one of the principal Tenants of the Honour of Petworth. Between the years 1189 and 1196, I find Henry de Perci fol lowed by William de Alta Ripa, attesting a Charter which Henry Husey, a great Feoffee of the Earl of Arundel, then expedited to Dureford Abbey (Sussex). 13 Also a Charter which William de Albini, third Earl of Sussex, of his line, expedited to Boxgrave Priory in the time of King Richard I, has the attestations of Richard de Perce, William de Alta Ripa, and Robert his Son.13 Whether this Robert de Alta Ripa, son of William, were the same person with Robert de Alta Ripa, Clerk, who on 23d Oct. 1204, was appointed as Colleague of Thomas de Erdinton, in the Bailiwick of the Counties of Salop and Stafford,14, 1 cannot deter mine. At Michaelmas, 1205, these Sheriffs, or rather Keepers, rendered account of their joint custody of those Counties ;15 and in 1212 and 1213, 1 find Robert de Alta Ripa active in the sen-ice of King John elsewhere.16 Whether this Robert de Hauterive were head of his family I can not say, but am inclined to think not.

In the earliest of these the Lord of \" Kebrinton\" is put in charge for some due ; on the second William de Alta Ripa stands in the same predicament.17 In 1216, and probably from his connexion with the Earl of Arundel, William de Alta Ripa was in rebellion against King John. On August 16, of that year, the Sheriff of Salop is ordered to give the land which was William de Alta Ripa's in Kenbricton to Thomas de Erdinton, during the King's pleasure.18 On July 24, 1217, a precept of Henry III informs the Sheriff of Salop that Willam de Alta Ripa had returned to his allegiance, and the said Sheriff is to restore his estates.19 On November 8, 1 233, Hugh de Albini, last Earl of Arundel of his line, fined 2500 merks to have seizin of his estates and Castles, notwithstanding his minority. The three Castles he was forthwith to give up to three Knights, Tenants of his own, who should have custody thereof till he came of age, they (the Knights) giving security to the King that they would discharge such trust without injury to the King's interests. William de Alta Ripa was the Knight who was named, in the first instance, thus to have charge of Arundel Castle, but another was afterwards substituted.20 In or about the year 1240, William de Alta Ripa, Auterive, or Hauterive is written on three nearly contemporary Rolls as holding Kembricton, by service of half a Knight's Fee, and of the Barony of Fitz Alan.21\u2014 It is difficult to account for this alleged Tenure. There is no appearance of scribal error in the Record, such as would invalidate the thrice-repeated statement; and its authority is further sub stantiated by later documents. That Fitz Alan was at this period (1240) reputed to be seigneural Lord of Kemberton is then a fact, but how to account for it is another matter. \u2014 The first John Fitz Alan who died about this time had had to wife Isabel sister of Hugh de Albini the then (1240) Earl of Arundel. Possibly some seigneury over Kemberton had been given with the Lady in frank-marriage. \" Forest Roll, Salop, No. ii, memb. 4 recto. 18 Claus. I, 281. 19 Ibidem, p. 315. =0 Rot. Fin. 18 Hen.

The second John Fitz Alan, son of John and Isabel, and a Minor at this time, afterwards acquired the Honour of Arundel as Coheir of Albini, but such Coheirship had not yet arisen. I cannot but think that Kemberton was at this time held of the Honour of Petworth. If so, all we can say is, that the Record fails to make mention of Percy's interest in the Manor, an interest which will have stood mediate between Albini or Fitz Alan on the one hand and Hauterive on the other. William de Percy, Lord of the Honour of Petworth,22 died in 29 Henry III (1244-5), leaving his son Henry in minority, and therefore in ward to the King. As Guardian of the said heir, the King on January 5, 1247, received the fealty of Andrew, son and heir of William de Alta Ripa, in respect of 2*2 Knights' Fees and a fifth part of a Knight's- Fee which the aforesaid William de Alta Ripa had held of William de Percy. The King's Escheator, Henry de Wingeham, was to take Andrew's security for his Relief, viz. =613. 10.?., and give him seizin of the said Fees.23 The Salop Pipe-Roll of 1259 gives John de Alta Ripa as owing 5 merks, his obligation to take knighthood being respited for that Fine. On May 6, 1269, John Fitz Alan (III), being then at Arundel Castle, acknowledges himself to have received the homage and fealty of Henry de Perci, and binds himself to defend, warrant, and save harmless the said Henry, as against the King, and in respect of the said homage done to himself.24 John Fitz Alan (III) died on Friday, March 18, 1272.25 An extent of his lands taken at Oswestry on June 25 following is so completely defaced that we are unable to ascertain whether there was any mention made of his interest in the Fee of Kemberton.26 22 In 1241-2, a feodary of the Honour of Arundel shows William de Percy hold- ing 21i fees in Petworth, thereof.

In 1284, it is stated that William de Alta Ripa holds the vill of Kemberton of Henry de Percy for half a Knight's Fee, but no mention is made as to the person under whom Percy held it.27 At the Assizes of October 1292, William de Alta Ripa was reported by the Jurors of Brimstree Hundred as a Defaulter in due attendance.28 In 1316, William Paynel was returned as Lord of Kemberton, apparently in succession to Hauterive, but how such succession came about I cannot declare. I think however that William Painel had the Manor in right of his wife Eva, and that she was the heir of Hauterive.29 William Paynel was a Grantor to Heringham Priory (Sussex), and died April 1, 1317. His widow Eva is mentioned in the same year as Eva de St. John, she having as I think remarried to Edward de St. John.30 When we come to speak of Kemberton Church we shall have further mention of this Edward de St. John and Eva his Wife, in 1339. I here quit the subject as far as the feudal tenure of this Manor is concerned. It is a question still intricate at a later \u00e6ra than that of which we have treated. I would briefly remark that the seigneury of Fitz Alan Earl of Arundel appears to have extended to Kemberton at subsequent periods ; but that at the same time documents have been referred to Kemberton which really relate to another place.31 The only Under-Tenant in this Manor of whom I find material notice was Alan de Kemberton, who sat as a Juror of Brimstree Hundred at the County Assizes of September 1272, and who within ten years of that date attests several local Deeds.

The Manor was doubtless within the Saxon Parish of Iteshale, and the Church founded here is probably included among those subject Chapels of Idsall which are alluded to as early as the reign of Stephen. A pension of 5 shillings, still paid by the Rector of Kemberton to the Vicar of Shiffnal, may, I think, be taken to indicate a com position which the Founder of Kemberton Church must necessarily have concluded with Shrewsbury Abbey, or with the Patrons of Idsall Church, before the minor foundation could exist. Possibly, however, this charge arose upon some early transfer of the local tithes to the district Church. The Advowson of Kemberton Church, whenever founded, be longed to the family of Hauterive. William de Alta Ripa, probably he who lived in time of Henry II, granted the same to the Sussex Priory of Heringham or Hardham. In 1291, the Church of Kemberton, in the Defftiery of Newport, was valued at \u00a32. 13s. 4d. per annum, besides a pension of \u00a31. 10s. which the Prior of Heveringham received therefrom.32 In 1341, the Parish was assessed to the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb at \u00a32. 4s. The reasons of the difference were because the greater sum or taxation included small tithes, offerings, and other spiritualities which were not contemplated in- the assessment of the Ninth, and because the Parish contained only one township, in which there were no sheep.33 In 1534, the Rectory of Kemberton, of which John Yate was Incumbent, was valued at \u00a36. per annum; which sum was charge able with 6s. 8d. for Procurations, 1*. lid. for Synodals, and a pension of 5s. due to the Vicar of Idsall.34 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

They further quit all future claim to the said Advowson, both for themselves and the heirs of Eva.

This word (unnoticed by our Saxon Lexicographers) has its reflex in the German ijotfj, and we find it entering into the composition of num berless English names. We have it in Hook-norton, Hock-ley, Hug-ley, Hough-ton, Iving-hoe, Hock-day (i. e. High Day), and also in Huche-ford or Hug-ford. And as Hook-norton has been sometimes spelt Hog-norton, and as Hugley is now Higley or Highley, so Hucheford, or Hugford, has become Higford. But it is singular that, in the latter instance, the circumstances which originally gave name to the place should come to be so nearly represented in modern etymology : for if we spell the name \" Highford \" instead of \" Higford,\" we have at once its distinctive features \u2014 an eminence overhanging a passable part of the adjacent river Worf.

Lacy's Seigneury over Higford and some other Shropshire Manors seems however to have passed about the year 1175 to Fitz Alan. It was then that the second William Fitz Alan espoused the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, and I doubt not that the transfer of these seignoral rights constituted the marriage portion of the Lady. Berner, the Domesday Tenant of Higford, was ancestor, I believe, of a knightly race which took name from this Manor as their 1 Domesday, so. 256, b. 1."], [27, "11 HIGFORD. principal seat ; for both Berner and the Hugfords had other pos sessions in Shropshire. It is, in fact, Berner's Domesday Tenure of Middleton by Bitterley, under William Pantulf, and the sub sequent Tenure of that same Middleton by the Hugfords, which suggests the genealogical fact which I venture to assume. If Berner were Domesday Lord of two distant Manors (Middleton and Higford), held under different Suzerains, and if those two Manors were afterwards possessed by the Hugfords, it follows that the Hugfords were in all probability Berner's descendants and heirs.2 The eighty years which followed Domesday supply however no circumstance in connection with this family which can be cited to show the mode of such descent. In 1165, Nicolaus de Hungerford is entered as holding 4 Knights' Fees of the Barony of Hugh de Lacy ; and these fees were of old feoffment, that is, had been granted to Nicholas or his ancestors before the death of Henry I (1135) .3 The Haughmond Chartulary supplies a piece of evidence illus trative of the connection which, about the year 1175, existed between Lacy, Fitz Alan, and Hugford. Roger de Scotot, or Esketot (Lacy's tenant at Bitterley) granted a rent of 4s. to Haughmond. His grant is tested by Nicholas de Huggeford (Lacy's tenant at Middleton juxta Bitterley) : \u2014 and Hugh de Lacy's contemporary confirmation of this grant is tested by William, son of William Fitz Alan, who, as I have suggested above, married Lacy's daughter about this time, and became Hugford's Suzerain, both at Middleton and Higford.4 Nicholas de Hugford was probably succeeded very soon after this transaction by his son Walter. Of the latter, the earliest notice which I find is where, with Guy le Strange, Marscot, Peter de Morton, Philip his Son, and Wydo de Shawbury, he attests a Charter to Haughmond Abbey, which must have passed in or shortly before the year 1179.5 In 1195-6, when William Fitz Alan (II) confirmed the sale of certain lands which Fulk Fitz Warin (II) had held under him, his Deed was attested ' inter alios' by Walter de Huggeford and Henry his Brother.6 The reason of such attestation will be apparent, if, as I suppose, Walter de Huggeford was Brother-in-Law of Fitz 2 Ledewic (Upper Ledwich) was also held by Berner, at Domesday, under WU liam Pantulf.

I suppose then that Emmeline de Hugford, who occurs in the very beginning of the reign of John, and who was Aunt of the third Fulk Fitz Warin, was also Widow of the last-named Walter de Hugford. The Fitz-Warin Chronicle represents the said Walter as surviving the accession of John. My reason for thinking otherwise is as follows : \u2014 King John was crowned May 27, 1199, and, on June 14 follow ing, Emeline de Ugeford (or Hugeford), of Shropshire, is named as sole Defendant in a suit wherein she was impleaded by Robert de Marisco for land in Gloucestershire. There were further moves in this suit on June 17, 1199, and May 14, 1200,7 but in each instance Erneline appears as a Feme-Sole, and not a Feme-Covert. Walter de Huggeford therefore, sometime her husband, will surely have deceased before the commencement of this Suit. \u2014 We have better information as to the manner than the time of his death. After the accession of Richard I, the first regular8 Assizes held in Shropshire were in the fifth year of John (October 1203). At these Assizes, cognizance was taken of local matters which might have transpired any time within the previous fourteen years. \u2014 Among other things the Brimstree Jurors reported of one Robert White (Albus), that, \"having slain Walter de Huggeford, he fled, and was outlawed for the murder.\" That the offence had been committed some time before is probable, for the recollection of the Jurors was not accurate. The Court of the County and the Coroner averred that Robert White had not been outlawed, because no one prosecuted the accusation against him. For their contra diction of a superior body the Brimstree Jurors were pronounced in misericordid; Robert White was to be summoned in the usual form.9 His chattels, worth 15s., were to be accounted of by Richard de Ambersleg, Sheriff.10 7 Rot. Curia Regis, I, 232, 235; and 9 \"Et predictus Robertus interrogetur.\" This decree of the Court I take to be equi valent to that of \" exigatur,\" which was an order to the Sheriff to summon a fugi tive five times in the County Court. If he failed to appear, he could then be out lawed. II, 277. 8 There was a visit of Justices Itinerant to Shropshire in Sept. 1199, and perhaps other such visits, between 1189 and 1203, but none of them seems to have consti tuted a regular Assize, or to have em braced those particular matters which were termed Placita Coron\u00e6. 10 Salop Assizes, 5 John, memb. 2 dorso. Richard de Ambersleg was Under-Sheriff"], [29, "13 HIGFORD. The outlawry of Fulk Fitz Warin (III) took place in 1200-1, and continued till November 1203. The Fitz-Warin Chronicle speaks of his having been at Higford more than once in the interval. Though we cannot accept every fact of a story which presents Fulk (III) and Fulk (II) as one individual, it is curious to observe the glimpses of truth which pervade this Legend. Fulk and his outlawed companions retired from the anger of King John, in the first instance, to Little Brittany. Returning thence into England, \" they came at last to Huggeford, to Sir Walter de Huggeford, who had married\" (says the Chronicle) \"Dame Vileine, daughter of Guarin de Metz ; but her right name was Emeline, and she was the Aunt of Sir Fulk.\" This extract requires two material corrections. \u2014 Emmeline de Huggeford, Aunt of Fulk Fitz Warin III, must have been Grand daughter, not Daughter of Warin de Metz ; also she must have been Mother, rather than Wife, of the Sir Walter de Huggeford of 1200-1. The Fitz-Warin Chronicle further informs us how John Fitz Warin was cured at Hugford of a wound which he had received in a skirmish with some of the King's party; how also Hugford afforded a temporary refuge to Maude Vavasour (or as the writer calls her, Maud de Caus), the wife of the outlawed Fulk.11 Here again we find a ground for doubting the circumstantial accuracy of the Chronicle, for there is good evidence that Maude Vavasour did not become the wife of Fulk Fitz Warin till after the latter was reconciled to King John. Leaving these accessory matters, I should speak of Walter de Hugford, the second of that name, who held Higford, Middleton Higford, Upper Ledwich, and Bitterley, under Fitz Alan, and who was thus by far the most important of that class of Shropshire Feudatories whose tenure was not immediately under the Crown. At the Assizes of October 1203, this Walter appears as a Knight, a Juror in causes of Grand Assize, as a Litigant in regard to his lands at Ledwich, and as convicted of some transgression for which he was fined 1 merk. In 1207, Walter de Hugford was a prisoner in the hands of Robert de Ropesley, \u2014 and probably at Kenilworth Castle.12 The in 5 and 6 John, i. e. from Sept. 1202 to Sept. 1204.

In the beginning of September apparently, he offers to the King the sum of 80 merks, \" that he may be given up to Hugh de Nevill to deliver him from the King's Prison, as said Hugh had been enjoined, and Hugh de Nevill himself will be answerable herein.\"13 This enormous fine procured the King's Mandate, dated Sept. 6, and addressed to Robert de Ropesley, ordering him to cause Walter de Hugeford \" Prisoner for the forest,\" to be given up to Hugh de Nevill, or \"to his undoubted messenger charged with his letters.\"1* Before Michaelmas 1209, Walter de Hugford had paid his fine \"and was quit;\" but Philip de Huggeford, and Nicholas his Brother, appear as joint accountants for another fine, viz. \" of 50 merks and a palfrey that they may be released from the King's prison.\" They had already paid 45 merks; and afterwards accounted for the balance to the Sheriff of Herefordshire, as was alleged.15 At the close of John's reign, Walter de Hugford will have shared in the disaffection of his Suzerain, \u2014 John Fitz Alan. Letters of King Henry III, certifying the Sheriff of Shropshire, that Hugford had returned to his allegiance, bear date Nov. 4, 1217.16 At the County Assizes of November 1221, Walter de Hugford appears as a Juror of Grand Assize. His litigation in 1224-6 with his neighbour Hugh de Beckbury has been already noticed.17 In 1231, he had been fined by Justices of the Forest 20s, \" because his dogs coursed without license ;\" and William Pantulf was surety for the Fine, It would be tedious to give even a summary of the numerous Charters in which this Walter de Hugford appears as a prominent or a principal witness. I should be inclined to name the year 1235 as perhaps the latest limit of any such undated occurrences of his name. He was succeeded by his son, a third Walter de Hugford, whose almost continuous occupation of his Father's position leaves the exact period of succession a matter only of surmise. \u2014 Such will ordinarily be our uncertainty in cases where the same Christian name belonged to successive generations of any family not holding in capite of the Crown.

Having nothing further to say of her, I pass to Walter de Hugford (III), who about the year 1240 is registered as holding lands in Huggeford and its appurtenances, of the Barony of Fitz Alan, and by service of four Knights' Fees.19 At Michaelmas 1250, Walter de Hugford had been amerced \u00a320 for a \" false presentment, and other transgressions.\" Some Jury of which he was Principal had, I suppose, given a dishonest verdict. In 1252, he had proffered 10 merks to the Crown to have an exemption from all liability to serve on Juries (Assizes they are called).20 Old age or infirmity was probably the ground of this. His non-appearance in due course at the County Assizes in January 1256 was reported by the Jurors of Brimstree Hundred, whereupon he was declared to be in misericordid. Later at these Assizes he was in Court, viz. as Guardian or rather Father-in-Law of Andrew de Wililey, whose wardship, as I have already shown, was then matter of litigation.21 I cannot suppose that Walter de Hugford survived much longer, for Sir William, his son and heir, stands first witness of a Deed, already quoted under Tong, and which must have passed between 1255 and 1263.22 Sir William de Hugford was distinguished as a Royalist in the political movements of his time. On May 20, 1265, King Henry III, then a Captive at Hereford, is constrained to mention him as one of those Lords Marchers who had been enjoined by a writ previously expedited\\t Worcester to leave the Kingdom for the peace thereof.23 V It is well known in what^ this peace, thus contemplated by the King's Gaolers consisted, \u2014 viz. their own undisturbed ascendency.

Evesham, a few months later, paved the way to another and more enduring settlement of the national distresses. In August 1267, William de Hugford prosecuted the Abbot of Buildwas and another unsuccessfully, for some disseizin.2* This cause was heard by the King himself at Shrewsbury, as was also another, wherein William de Hugford was sued by Robert de Lacy for having disseized the said Robert of 11 virgates in Dunton.25 Hugford pleaded that his seizin was by gift of the King because that Lacy had in the late disturbances taken part against the Crown. A Writ of the King was read in Court, which informed the Sheriff of Salop and Stafford that \" We have given to our faithful and beloved William de Hugford, all Robert de Lacy's lauds in Dunton.\" Lacy rejoined that the King did not contem plate his forfeiture (non intellexit de ipso), but probably that of another Robert de Lacy in Staffordshire, and, to determine this, he appealed to the King's Rolls of Chancery. \u2014 Hugford answered, that after the battle of Evesham, the King gave away the lands of his enemies, and that Hamo le Strange, seeing that Lacy \" had always been with Symon de Montfort \" in the late disturbances, seized his land till the Parliament of Winchester (September 1265), and that in that Parliament, the King bestowed the said land on himself (Hugford). \u2014 At this point Lacy was found to have left the Court, I suppose, for it is said that, \" being thrice summoned, he had departed in contempt.\" \u2014 -\"Therefore he takes nothing. \u2014 His amercement is excused.\" In November 1271, William de Hugford was fined by Justices of the Forest for some offence within their cognizance, and said to have been committed in Northwode.26 In 1275, he appears as owing an arrear of the tax of the Fifteenth then recently levied, viz. 10s. chargeable on \u201ehis property in Hugford.27 In 1284, his Manor of Hugford is described as including the vills of Norton, Apley, and Astall, whereon he owed to his Suzerain, Richard Fitz Alan, the service of two Knights for forty days in war-time at his own charges.

At the same time William de Hugford was holding the Manors of Middleton and Ledwich under the same Fitz Alan, and the Staffordshire Manor of Hilderston under John, son of Adam de Chetwynd. In the latter, Robert dc Hugford was Feoffee of his Brother.28 In 1291, Sir William procured the King's Charter of Free Warren in Huggeford, Appele Middleton, and Ledewich.29 At the Assizes of 1292, his non-attendance was reported by the Brimstree Jurors ; but the words Habet breve, added to the entry, indicate his exemption under writ of the King. His claim of Free Warren was presented and allowed. His appearances on important Inquisitions and Perambulations, his attestations of Charters with others of his rank, are too numerous to mention. The latest notice which I have of him is, that on July 7, 1297, he was summoned as holding lands of \u00a320. annual value to prepare himself with horses and arms for foreign service.30 Sir William was soon afterwards succeeded by his Son, a fourth Sir Walter. The latter first appears at the County Assizes, July, 1301, as being sued by Oliver de Lee for aright of common-pasture over 200 acres in Hugford, whereof he had disseized the said Oliver. This cause was twice adjourned: \u2014 in the first instance because all the Recognizors were challenged (calumpniati sunt) on the ground that Richard de Harley, then Sheriff of the County, had married a Relation of the Defendant.31 On May 3, 1313, Walter de Hugford has the King's Letters of protection till August 1 following, he being one of those who, in the suit of the Earl of Pembroke, were about to accompany the King to France.32 He sat in two Parliaments as a Knight of the Shire, viz. in the Parliament summoned to meet at Westminster on January 20, 1315, and in that summoned to meet at York, May 2, 1322 .33 In March 1316, he was returned as Lord of the Manors or 28 Kirby's Quest. 39 Charter at Apley Park ; enrolled in Sot.

His employments between the years 1308 and 1325, as a Collector of Taxes, a Supervisor of Array, a Leader of Levies, or a Justice of Assize, are the subject of nearly a score of entries on Rolls of Edward II's reign. The last Commission in which I find him employed bears date March 25, 1329. With Roger Corbet of Caus and Roger Carles he was then appointed Keeper of the Peace in this County, which was much disturbed by the depredations and crimes of sundry unlawful associations.34 Sir Walter de Hugford was succeeded by several generations in the male line, till at length Alice, Sister and eventual heir of the last Sir William de Hugford, carried his estates into the family of Lucy of Charlcote. Further particulars of this succession I reserve to a future occasion. The principal Members of the very extensive Manor of Higford were Apley, Astall, Norton, and Boningale. I should say some thing of each of these. Apley, though it has long since changed places with Higford and become the Caput of the collective Manor, had at the time of which I write no such prominence. Two centuries after Domesday it is first mentioned as an appurtenance of Higford. Norton, so called I presume with reference to its position northwards of Stockton, seems, in part at least, to have belonged to the latter [Manor. However it has been mentioned in one instance as a member of Higford, and so was perhaps divided. Astall, formerly Estwall, was held under the Hugfords by a family which took name from the place. Thus we have Richard and Philip de Estwelle occurring in a deed of Walter de Hugford at the beginning of the thirteenth Century.35 In 1221 we hear of Geoffrey de Eswell. Adam de Estwelle occurs in 1244, Robert in 1256, Richard and Walter in 1276, and Robert in 1292. I now pass to \u2014 BONINGALE; \u2014 which, being quite isolated from the capital Manor of Hugford, was yet an important member thereof. The Tenants here had name from the place, and, though of less than knightly degree, were in a position little inferior. 34 F\u0153dera, II, 755. | \u00bb Supra, Vol.11, p.70\u00ab."], [35, "19 BONINGALE. The first who occurs is Henry de Bolynghale in the 12th Cen tury. Hugh de Bolinghale occurs from 1203 to 1228, but in no other capacity than a Witness, a Juror, or a Surety. He had a Brother Nicholas of whom I find mention in 1200 and 1203, and both before the former and after the latter year. In 1221, Walter de Bolinghale, a Monk of Buildwas, is mentioned. From 1250 to 1275, Hugh de Bolinghale, apparently the second of his name, is constantly occurring. He was accused of homicide at the Assizes of January 1256, but an Inquisition for which he and Hugh de Beckbury respectively paid 20 merks and 5 merks seems to have acquitted them both. The case was among the present ments of the Jurors of Cundover Hundred, and the Sureties for payment of the two Fines were Robert, brother of Thomas Corbet of Caus, Ralph de Butill, and Robert Blundel. At the Assizes of 1272, Hugh de Bolinghale has already appeared as a Litigant.36 He is also named as second Juror of the Hundred of Brimstree on that occasion. Within five years next following he made over the whole of his property, both that which he held under the Lords of Albrighton at Bishton, and that which he held under Sir William de Hugford at Boningale, to Lilleshall Abbey. His grant in Bishton has already been set forth.37 It was con firmed by Sir John de Pichford, Knight, with the addition of an \" assart near Holobroc, which Walter Clerk sometime held.\"38 The grant of Boningale seems to have been much more im portant. The Grantor conveys it to the Abbey \"in pure and perpetual almoign, for the health of the souls of himself and Felicia his wife, together with all homages, reliefs, escheats, and ward ships,\" or, in short, all that he could bestow.39 Sir William de Hugford, Knight, gave what seems to be a con temporary Confirmation of Hugh de Bolinghale's Grant, relin quishing every right pertaining to himself as Seignoral Lord. This Confirmation was speedily followed by a Convention between Sir William de Hugford and William Abbot of Lilleshull, which, as illustrating the subject of Feudal Tenures, I give more in detail. \u2014 3fi Supra, Vol.11, p. 38 n. 37 Supra, Vol. II, p. 167. de _41brichton, and Robert de Bispeston. 39 Lilleshall Chartulary, p. 79.

Sir William and his Heirs bind themselves and their Manor of Hugford, and their Men within the said Manor, to acquit the Abbot's land of Bolinghale of all foreign services which the land of Bolinghale was used to discharge in conjunction with the Manor of Hugford ; to wit, the obligation of finding one man in five to appear at the Great Turn of the Hundred and before the King's Justices ;\u2014 also of Scutage, Hidage, Stretward, Motfethe, and of the service which the land of Bolingale used to perform at Oswestry ;\u2014 and of all other services. And as often as anything of the premises should happen to be required from Bolingale, the Sheriff of Salop should levy his distress on the Manor of Hugford till Bolingale should be set free.40 This may be estimated as the last acquisition, of any territorial importance, which was made by Lilleshall Abbey. The first Statute of Mortmain, following in 1279, checked all such transfers. The account of the arrears of the Fifteenth, which I have already quoted as charging 10s. on Sir William de Hugford in 1275, charges 2s. ll^d. on Adam le Bercher in Bonigale. He (Adam) was, I imagine. Tenant there at the time of the charges above indicated. The Inquest of 1284 gives us a statement about \"Bolinghall\" which shows how little we should depend on these Records for accuracy of detail. It says that the \"Abbot of Lylushall holds the Manor of Bolinghall of William de Hugford in capite (by service) of going with him in war-time for 40 days into Wales at his (the Abbot's) own charges.\"41 The fact was that the Abbot did not at the period hold the Manor (if such it was) under Hugford at all, nor was any such service due thereon. The Taxation of 1291 values the Abbot of Lilleshall's interests in Bolinghale, in the Deanery of Newport, as follows :4a \u2014 A Carucate of land annually worth .... \u00a31 0 0 A Mill, annually worth 0 6 0 Assized Rents 1 10 0 Woods, yielding annually 0 6 8 Pleas and Perquisites (of the Manor Court) .020 The Total of \u00a33. 4s. 8d. indicates a valuable property. 40 This Charter was written and sealed in duplicate, eacjj Copy being sealed by both the Contracting parties.

Turning to the Quo Waranto Rolls, I find a Case where the Abbot's rights in several Manors, Bolynghull included, were questioned by Hugh de Louther.44 The whole matter was adjourned, and I can not learn the result.

Between the histories of Cleobury North and Hopton Wafre there has been a marked analogy from a very early period. About the time when Edward the Confessor came to the throne, both these vills belonged to the Church [of Worcester : Cleobury North was then called Ufere-Cleobyrig, i. e. Over or Upper Cleobury.1 We have a Record as to the mode in which the Church of Worcester lost its Shropshire possessions. \u2014 Earl Sweyn, the eldest son of Earl Godwin, was a monster of licentiousness and cruelty. Whatever has been effected by literary research or political sympathy to establish a reputation for Godwin and his other sons, the character of Sweyn is still dark as ever. Among his crimes was the violation of Algiva, Abbess of Leomin ster, whose abduction is assigned by the Saxon Chronicle to the year 1046, when Sweyn was returning from a successful expedition into Wales. The same Chronicle represents the ultimate release of the Abbess as a voluntary act on the part of Sweyn.2 A more circumstantial account3 tells us that he was obliged to put her away by the threats of Edsius (Eadsige), Archbishop of Canterbury (1038 1050), and Lyfing, Bishop of Worcester,4 and that, in revenge of this interference, Sweyn, assisted by the influence of powerful friends, procured that the Church of Worcester should be deprived of M\u00e6rebroc,5 Hopton, and TJferecleobyrig, with many other lands in Shropshire. \u2014 It seems that both Hopton and Cleobury North were later in the Confessor's reign, held by one Seuuard, \" a free man.\" Seuuard's tenure had ceased before Domesday, under what circum stances I cannot say : but it is worth noting that Siward, described as \"a rich man of Shropshire,\" was once called upon to give evidence in a matter which affected the rights of the Church of Worcester elsewhere, that he was thus called upon at a period shortly antecedent to Domesday, and that the evidence wanted was 1 So \"Uferebyrig\" of Heming's Char tulary is now \" Overbury.\" probably misdated in the Saxon Chronicle. At all events the confused chronology of the period requires some rectification, to which the text may contribute. 5 Mr. Blakeway identifies M\u00e6rebroc with Morbrook, a farm in the parish of Aston Botterel, which took, he says, its name from a rivulet which flows out of the Moors on the Brown Clee HiU. 2 \" He had her as long as he list, after which he let her go home.\" (Ingram's Saxon Chronicle, p. 217.) 3 Heming's Chartulary, p. 275.

If so, Siward was probably Tenant to the Church of Worcester at Cleobury North and Hopton when the said Church was deprived of those Manors. \u2014 The Church lost the Seigneury by Earl Sweyn's contrivance, but Siward retained the tenancy throughout the Confessor's reign, if not later. Cleobury North is noticed in Domesday thus : \u2014 Roger de Laci holds Cleberie of the King; and Uluuard (holds it) of him. Seuuard held it (in time of King Edward) and was a free man.

Here is a Mill of 4 shillings (annual value). In time of King Edward the Manor was worth 12 shillings, and afterwards 7 shil lings. Now it is worth 20 shillings.7 According to one construction which may be put upon this part of Domesday, the two-and-a-half hides of Cleobury North were inclusive of a hide which the Record makes supplementary mention of under the name of Dodentone, for it says at the foot of the same page, \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Dodentone, and it pertains to Claiberie. Herein is one hide and it is valued there,\" \u2014 i. e.under the estimate of Cleobury North. This last entry is in paler ink and in a different handwriting to the body of the Record. It is moreover carelessly inserted between two portions of the Domesday notice of Stantone (Stanton Lacy), another of Laci's Manors, but in Colmestane Hundred. I think however that we ought not to conclude that the Dodentone thus spoken of was in Colmestane Hundred. Associating it, if I must do so, with Cleobury North, I suppose it to have been an adjacent part of the territory of Ditton (now Ditton Priors) ; which part, though called Ditton or Dodentone, was joined manorially to Cleobury.8 0 Monasticon, I, 602, Num. xxxviii. intelligible, as I shaU show under Cleo bury Mortimer.

Escaping now from the topographical difficulty with which the Domesday account of Cleobury North is encumbered, we pass to a problem of another kind : \u2014 In 1085, Roger de Laci held this Manor in capite of the King, but his interest here can be traced no further. In no other docu ment but Domesday does the name of Laci occur in connection with the Manor. That Laci's original Fief suffered from successive dismember ments in the reigns of William Rufus, Henry I, Stephen, and Henry II, is certain. The cause, manner, and extent of each such diminution cannot be clearly traced, but it is evident that very shortly after Domesday Cleobury North passed from the Fief of Lacy to that of Bernard de Newmarch, the Conqueror of Brecknockshire. Now, Roger de Laci joined the Worcestershire rebellion of 1088, but we do not know that he suffered any loss thereby. That he did not thus forfeit Cleobury is apparent from the fact that Bernard de Newmarch, who gained the Manor, was on the same side with Laci in that rebellion.9 Again in 1095, Roger de Laci joined in the treason of Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumberland. This we know caused the utter forfeiture and exile of Roger de Laci, but it is stated in general terms that the King conferred his inheritance on Hugh de Laci, his Brother. I am inclined however to think that the whole of the forfeited lands were not thus bestowed. Bernard de Newmarch was clearly seignoral Lord of Cleobury in the time of Henry I. This fact is thus determined : \u2014 Bernard de Newmarch was Founder of Brecknock Priory. His Charter, reciting his own and other grants thereto, expresses the consent of King Henry I to the foundation. Among the grants which his Vassals (homines) had made to the Priory, and which he confirms, he specifies how Walter de Cropus had given \" his tithe of Lansefred, and, in England, the Church of Cliberia and whatever belongeth thereto.\"10 Having now established Cleobury as a Member of the Honour of 9 Ordericus, 704, C. Walter de Crozpuz having granted thereto all his tithes in Wales. This Charter, from its testing clause, must have passed between 1102 aud 1107. 10 Monasticon, III, 264, Num. II. Another Charter of Bernard de New march to Brecknock Priory, speaks of"], [41, "25 CLEOBURY NORTH. Brecknock in the time of Henry I, I must leave to a tabular statement (hereafter to be given under Hopton Wafre), the mode in which that Fief passed from Bernard de Newmarch to Dc Bohun Earl of Hereford. The same Table will show the succession of the seignoral Lords of Cleobury -North and Hopton Wafre. I will now speak of those who held this Manor immediately under De Laci in the first instance, and under the Lords of Breck nock in the next. Uluuard, the Tenant of 1086, was probably a Saxon, and, like Saxon Tenants in general, speedily removed. Walter de Cropus, holding the Manor between 1100 and 1130, I take to have been Ancestor of that family of Le Wafre who con tinued to hold Cleobury North, Hopton Wafre, and other lands of the Honour of Brecknock,11 till an heir female, Lucia le Wafre, carried the same to her husband, Roger de Mortimer of Chirk. I will say more of this family of Le Wafre when I come to Hopton Wafre. Cleobury was early granted by one or other of that race to a Feoffee whose importance elsewhere was quite equal to that of his Feoffor. Some verbal coincidences which here present themselves, though I think them merely accidental, are worth remark if it be only to show how apparent coincidences may happen without having any real connection. The old name of Cleobury North was, as we have seen, Ufere Cleobury. We have also seen that the family of Wafre sometime held the Manor. There is however no probability that the Saxon adjective Ufere had anything to do with the Norman name Wafre, though the similarity of sound is suggestive of such an idea. Nor can I suppose that either word is associated with the Saxon proper-name Urfer, which I have now to bring forward in more remote connection with the subject.\u2014 Domesday informs us of three Staffordshire Manors (viz. Offelie, Haltone, and a third unnamed, but which I take to be Weston Jones), which were held under Robert de Stafford by Urfer, at the time of the Survey.12 Now, two of these Manors, and the third, if rightly identified, were held afterwards under the Barons Stafford by the very same Tenants who held Cleobury North under Le Wafre. These Tenants were usually called De Haughton, from their principal Staffordshire Manor, written above as \" Haltone.\" \u2014 They were also Tenants partly of the Crown and partly of Fitz \u00bb See Testa de Nevill, p. 65, Thoddes- I thorne. 12 Domesday, fos. 248, b. 2; 249, b. 1. ill. 4"], [42, "26 CLEOBURY NORTH. Alan at Withington in Shropshire, and of Fitz Alan at Knightley in Staffordshire. They were I doubt not lineal descendants of Urfer, though I cannot supply the hiatus between him and Roger Fitz Henry, who occurs eighty years later. The latter is returned in 1165 as holding i knight's fee of the Barony of Fitz Alan, and in fees of the Barony of Robert de Stafford.13 In one of the Stafford Fees his Under-tenants were William de Mere and Richard Fitz Noel. Neither of these entries relate to Roger Fitz Hem-y's tenure of Cleobury North, nor indeed can I find that the Tenants of the Honour of Brecknock are anywhere enumerated in the Liber Niger. A quarrel which Roger Fitz Henry had with Ralph de Bas kerville of Pickthorn in 1177 has been already spoken of.14 This however is the only circumstance which I find to associate the said Roger with the neighbourhood of Cleobury North. I have more to say of him under other localities, and will only state here that he seems to have died about March 1190, and that, having been a Tenant in Capite and his Heir being under age, his lands were for a time in the King's keeping. The said heir, called indifferently Thomas Fitz Roger or Thomas de Halghton, had livery in 1194. At the County Assizes, November 1221, Thomas Fitz Roger was suing the Prior of Brecknock under writ of Darrein Presentment for the Advowson of North-Claiburi. The Prior insisted that the Church was not vacant, whereupon the Plaintiff said, that if the Bishop had admitted any Incumbent, such act was in defiance of his, the Plaintiff's, appeal, and since the Plaintiff had sued out his Writ. The parties, at this juncture, came to an agreement and were ordered by the Court to have their Cyrographs?5 The Fine thus indicated is preserved. It purports to be levied at Salop on Nov. 8, 1221, between Thomas Fitz Roger, Plaintiff, and John Prior of Brecknock, Deforciant. The Prior had called to warranty Richard Abbot of Battle;16 but now he acknowledged the right of the Plaintiff, who was to nominate the future Incumbent to the Prior, the latter in turn presenting him to the Diocesan Bishop. The said Incumbent was, after admission, to 13 Liber Niger, Vol. I, pp. 143, 136. 14 Supra, Vol. I, p. 232.

For this acknowledgment the Plaintiff paid the Prior 2 merks.17 All that I have further to say of Thomas de Halecton in this place is, that he appears to have been deceased before the year 1240. At the latter period Robert de Halecton is entered on various Tenure Rolls as holding the several Manors of his inheritance which belonged to the Baronies of Stafford and Fitz-Alan.18 On Jan. 20, 1254, we have a proof of his continued connection with Cleobury North, for then, in consequence of another suit of Darrein Presentment to the Church of North Clebyry, Roger Prior of Brecon acknowledged the better right of Robert de Hilenton, who, for his part and that of his heirs, undertook to pay the Prior annually half a merk at Hopton le Wafre ; \u2014 and if he should allow such payment to fall into arrear, then the Prior might levy distress upon his lands &c. at Cleobury.19 The Inquest of 1255, which reports the Tenures of Stottesden Hundred, gives a full but somewhat confused account of the status of this Manor.20 I infer the matter to have stood thus : \u2014 The whole Lordship was estimated at 2 hides (less by half a hide than the Domesday measurement). It paid accordingly 4d. per hide for Stretward and Sd. per hide for Motfee. Robert de Haluchton held the whole under Robert Wafre, paying him 40s. annually for the same. Under Robert de Haluchton were two Tenants, viz. Philip de Beggesoure, who held a hide ; and Briee de Cleobury, who had been enfeoffed in a virgate on condition of his discharging the suit which Robert de Haluchton owed to County and Hundred for the collective Manor. The last that I hear of Robert de Haluchton is his appointment in Nov. 1259 as Justice for gaol-delivery at Salop.21 His Successor between the years 1260 and 1263 seems to have been Sir John de Haleton, knight, to whom and his heirs \" Walter de Clifford Lord of Corfham grants 6 acres of his bosc of Cleybury, to be measured by the royal perch.\" The said land is to be assarted by the Grantee, and is described as abutting on the corner 17 Pedes Finium, 6 Hen.

The Grantee has also license to dig coals within the Forest of La Clie, to sell or give away.^ Sir John de Haluchton seems to have been deceased in 1270, leaving a Widow, Agnes, and a Son and heir, Thomas. Thomas de Halghton was in turn deceased before November 25, 1282, when however his Mother Agnes was still surviving. The Inquests on his death report little which will illustrate our account of Cleobury North, except that it was not a Tenure in capite, and realized an income of \u00a37. 5s. Sd. per annum. His son Robert was his heir, and was not yet eighteen years of age, having been born on July 25, 1265. The said Heir's marriage belonged to Nicholas Baron Stafford.23 The Inquisitions of 1284 give us a full account of the Tenures of Robert de Haughton. \u2014 He held Hofyleye (High Offley) More juxta Weston, Haughton, Knightley, and Weston Jones under the Barons Stafford. He held Withington under Fitz Alan. Lastly, he held \" Cleybury North under Roger de Mortimer, of the Honour of Brekenok,\" whilst the said Roger held the same under the Earl of Hereford, and the Earl under the King.24 The same statement is repeated in a Tenure Roll of 23 Edw. I (1295) A On Jan. 30, 1304, the King's writ of Diem clausit extremum issued on the death of Robert de Halghton as of a Tenant of the Barony of Fitz Alan, then in manu Regis. \u2014 The Jurors, sitting at Withington on April 15 following, reported his income from Cleobury North to have been \u00a36. 16s. Sd. arising from 2 carucates of land, rents, and other sources. His son and heir Thomas, they said, was aged fifteen years on August 29, 1303. 22 From W.

Mr. Blakeway remarks on this deed as showing the low value of coal at that period (1260-3). It is the earliest mention which 1 have met with of coal-digging in Shropshire. Jurors were altogether mistaken as to the tenure of Cleobury North. They said that Thomas de Halghton had held half the Manor and the Advowson of the Church of the Master of the Templars, and the Bonour of Castle Bolgate by service of a fourth part of a Knight's fee. There was no Juror from the neighbourhood of Cleobury on the panel. Hence probably the error. 24 Kirby's Quest.

He was born therefore in 1288. The tenure of Cleobury North is accurately distinguished from his other estates, as being under Roger de Mortimer (of Chirk) .26 All I have here to say further of this descent is, that the heir, Thomas de Halghton, is entered as Lord of Cleobury North in the Feodary of 1316.27 The principal Tenants under De Haughton at Cleobury were the Lords of Badger, of whom I have given account in a former Volume. I have said that in 1221 Thomas Fitz Roger obtained a full title to the Advowson of Cleobury North from the Prior of Brecknock. Apparently at the same time Roger, son of Philip de Baggesore, quit-claims all right in the same Advowson to Sir Thomas Fitz Roger.

We have seen that a Church existed here in the reign of Henry I ; how it was then given to Brecknock Priory ; how this right of Advowson was in 1221 disputed by the Lord of the Fee ; how the Prior's right was commuted for a payment of two merks down and a mediate right of Presentation, which enabled him to exact the fealty of every successive Incumbent before he could be presented to the Bishop, such fealty being moreover a security for the payment of an annual pension by the said Incumbent to the Prior. We have further seen this Pension commuted in 1254 for an annual rent-charge on the estate of the Lord of Cleobury. \u2014 This freed the Church from all liability. So the Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Cleobury North, in Stottesden Deanery, at \u00a38. 13s. 4d. per annum, and makes no allusion to any pension due thereon.32 The Parochial Inquest of 1341 recites the above Taxation, but assesses the Parish only at \u00a32. 6s. 8d. The reasons given for the diminution were, that 2 virgates of land lay unfilled, the tenants having quitted under stress of poverty, that there were no sheep in the parish, and because the small-tithes, offerings, and glebe-land were computed in the Church Taxation, but were unavailable in estimating the Ninth?3 In 1534, the Church of Clybery North, of which Owyn Holcrofte was then Rector, is estimated to be worth \u00a35. 19s. 4d. per annum in glebe land, corn and other tithes and oblations. The Procura tions chargeable on this income were 6s. 8d. and the Synodals 6d.3i EARLY INCUMBENTS.35 Robert de Haluton, Incumbent of this Church, has a two years' license to study, dated May 27, 1278. He was probably brother of Sir Thomas, then Lord of the Manor. He occurs again as Incum bent in 1294. Thomas Dobyn, Subdeacon, Incumbent of this Church, has a five years' license to study, dated July 30, 1313 ; which license is renewed in 1315 for a similar period of five years.

Burtoartom This place, like Burwardsley, owes the first part of its name to an early Saxon Settler ; but whether the Burhred thus remembered were one or two persons I cannot determine, \u2014 nor do I think Helgot's subsequent interest in both Manors to be relevant to the question. Domesday tells us that \u2014 \"The same Radulfus (de Mortimer) holds Burertone (of the Earl), and Helgot (holds it) of him. Azor held it (in time of King Edward). Here is half a hide geldable. The (arable) land is (enough) for in ox-teams. Here two Villains have one team. It was waste (i. e. when it came to Mortimer) . Now it is worth 2 shillings\" (per annum).1 The Seigneury of Mortimer of Wigmore continued here for at least three Centuries, but the ordinary Successors of Helgot do not appear to have retained the Tenancy ; I say ordinary Successors, for it is clear to me that Robert de Girros, of whom I am next to speak in connection with Burwarton, was an early Feoffee of the Barons of Castle Holgate, even if a share of Helgot's Domesday Fief did not come to him by inheritance. The first occurrence of Robert de Girros is his attestation, about 1138-9, of Philip de Belmeis' grant to Buildwas Abbey; and in this instance his name is preceded by those of Herbert de Castello (then Lord of Holgate) and Nicholas his Brother.2 From Michaelmas 1155 till Michaelmas 1190, this Robert de Girros, or his Son of the same name, occurs as a Tenant of the Crown in the Royal Manor of Claverley. Then however his estates 1 Domesday, so. 257, a. 1. | ' Supra, Vol.11, p. 203."], [50, "32 BURWARTON. fell into the King's hands, probably by death and the minority of his heir, but of that we are not informed. This Escheat extended to various lands which he must have derived from the Barons of Holgate ; but whereas the succession to that Barony was about this time matter of dispute, we cannot conclude from hence that the Escheator's interference arose under any forfeiture. The Escheators' Rolls for the half years ending Michaelmas 1194 and March 1195 account for two sums of 13s. 7d. each, being the \"ferm of Robert de Girros' land of Burwardton.\"3\u2014 All that we may infer from this is, that Robert de Girros had been used to receive an annual income of \u00a31. 7s. 2d. in respect of his tenure at Burwarton ; \u2014 that such receipt would ordinarily, in case of the minority of an heir, go to the immediate Seigneur, that is, to the Lord of Holgate ; \u2014 but that now it went to the Crown, because the succession to the Barony of Holgate was at this period undetermined. Previous to Michaelmas 1195, another Robert de Girros, heir I presume of the last, had made some Fine with the Crown. Though this Fine is alluded to in four successive Pipe- Rolls, its amount and object are nowhere specified.4 \u2014 All this points to the same inference, viz. that the Crown was not immediately concerned in the succession of Girros, but only as Trustee of the abeyant Barony of Holgate. About this time I find Robert and Jordan de Girros attesting a Charter of William Fitz Alan (II) which appears to have passed in a full Court of the County. From this period till his death in 1251, Robert de Girros is constantly appearing in connection with one or other of his Shropshire estates. I shall often have to recur to his name. His concern at Burwarton seems to have been made over to his Sister Isabella, who, before 1207, had become the wife of Thomas de Constantyne, and whose son, another Thomas de Constantyne, was eventually found to be the Coheir of Robert de Girros. As regards the mesne interest possessed by the Lords of Holgate in Burwarton, it vanishes after the succession of Thomas Mauduit to that Barony. Thenceforth Burwarton was held immediately of Mortimer of Wigmore, by the heirs or assignees of Robert de Girros ; but this tenancy was not altogether undisturbed. \u2014 It would appear that both Robert de Girros and Thomas de 3 Rot.

Constantyne joined the Rebellious Barons in 1216 and 1217, and that Hugh de Mortimer took that opportunity of confiscating to himself whatever was held of his Barony by either or both those persons. On their return to the King's allegiance in 1217, each of them obtained general Letters of Reseizin. Mortimer does not seem to have recognized the exigency of these Letters. Hence he was sued by both Robert de Girros and Thomas de Constantyne, under different writs of novel disseizin, for their respective rights in Shineton and Burwarton. Both Plaintiffs were successful. The causes were tried at Shrewsbury in November 1221, when Hugh de Mortimer was found to have \"unjustly disseized Thomas de Costentin of his free tenement in Burewarton,\" and damages to the extent of 30 merks were awarded to the said Thomas.5 In 1240, Thomas de Costentin is entered as holding one third of a Knight's Fee in Borwarton under Ralph de Mortimer.6 Whether this Thomas were husband or Son of Isabella de Girros I cannot say. It was doubtless the second \" Thomas de Costentyn \" who, in 1255, is said to be Lord of Burewarton, in Stottesdon Hundred, and to hold the same immediately of Roger de Mortimer, for a third part of a Knight's-Fee. The Manor contained half a hide of land (its Domesday measurement), did suit to the Hundred, and paid the Sheriff 2d. annually for Stretward, and 4d. for Motfee? Adam de Montgomery had for his second wife Isabella, daughter and sole heir of Thomas de Constantine. The Lady died first ; and Adam being also deceased on July 28, 1 290, an Inquest, taken at Chetton, found him to have held the Manor of Borewarton by a third part of a Knight's-fee under Dame Matilda de Mortimer. His son by Isabella de Constantine was named Robert, and was found to be heir of Borewarton, being eighteen years of age on March 2, 1290.8 The issue of Isabella de Constantine appears to me to have become extinct, and the Manor of Burwarton to have passed to Walter de Hopton as her nearest of kin. Thus, on the death of Edmund de Mortimer of Wigmore in 1304, Walter de Hopton was found to be holding half a fee in Borewarton of that Barony.9 Also, when on March 10, 1305, Walter de Hopton was himself 5 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

The heir of Walter de Hopton was also a Minor at his Father's death, and so continued; for the Feodary of March 1316 gives Burwarton as in the King's hand, by reason of the nonage of Walter de Hopton.11 Observing that these Hoptons held the vill of Stanton, near Pembridge in Herefordshire, under the same House of Mortimer, I here quit a subject which must recur to our notice on many future occasions. Of the Under-tenants in this Manor we have several notices. First, I find William Ward or Wiard suing Roger de Burwarton and Alice his wife under writ of Mort d'Ancestre for half a virgate here. The matter resulted in a Fine, levied at Shrewsbury, Sept. 26, 1199, whereby William withdrew his claim. Roger and Alice, on their part, renounced all claim which they had in respect of Alice's right to dower in Lug*ton, by gift of Wiard the Forester, her former husband. They moreover gave to William 24s.12 It was doubtless in respect of his conduct in this Suit that Roger de Boreworton appears on the Pipe Roll as amerced one merk by the Justices in Eyre \" for unjust detention.\" 13 Before the transfer of Burwarton from Robert de Girros to his Brother-in-Law, one Philip de Girros seems to have held a small parcel of land here under his wealthy but probably distant relation. \u2014 In 1225, this Philip being dead, Emma his Widow was suing Thomas de Costantin for her thirds of half a virgate in Burwarton, which she claimed as dower.14 The Defendant did not appear, and no result is stated ; but among Pleas heard by the King himself at Salop in August 1226, Philip, son and heir of Philip, recovers seizin of half a virgate in Burwarton from Thomas de Costantyn.15 I have shown under Faintree how this same Philip recovered other land in that Manor on this occasion,16 but I did not there state, what here appears obvious, that his real name was Philip de Girros.

BURWARTON CHURCH. The first positive notice which I have of this Church is implied by mention of its Incumbents, but it was probably older than any such evidence would suggest. In 1291, the Church of Borewarton, in the Deanery of Stottesden, was valued at \u00a33. 6s.

Now, whereas we know from better authority, and indeed from another part of this very Chronicle, that Ralph de Mortimer was living some years after the succession of Henry I, and whereas William Longespee Duke of Normandy died in December, 942, that is a century-and-half before his alleged daughter's marriage ; and whereas Hugh de Mortimer survived this ostended date of his own nuptials eighty-five years, we may not place implicit reliance on the details of this \" Genealogical History.\" \u2014 The document however, such as it is, supplies us with all that we are likely to learn, or rather to hear, of the first Feoffees of Chelmarsh. William de Mortimer, we are told, a younger son of the Domesday Baron, was for a short time Lord of Chelmarsh, by bounty of Hugh his elder Brother, and afterwards he was Lord of Netherleye \" by singular and special gift of the same Lord Hugh.\" Hugh de Mortimer's reassumption of the Manor of Chelmarsh is shown by another document.3 About the middle of Stephen's reign, a Society of Augustine Canons, afterwards settled at Wigmore, had obtained a footing at Shobdon in Herefordshire. This was by procurement of Oliver de Merlimond, Chief Steward to Hugh de Mortimer. Their Patron falling into disgrace with his Suzerain, and forfeiting all his estates, the Canons experienced a like vicissitude of fortune. On one occasion indeed, and softened by the intercession of Robert de Betun, Bishop of Hereford, Mortimer seems to have been more leniently inclined to these Shobdon Canons. \u2014 He assumed the air of a Patron, promised them the vill of \" Cheilmers,\" and actually contemplated their removal thither. The situation of Chelmarsh, more distant from the Welsh Border, was judged to be better suited for a House of Religion than Shobdon. Neither the promised grant nor the proposed removal was ever carried into effect ; nay, the Canons were deprived of the vill of Shobdon without receiving any equivalent. Many years did these Churchmen experience the alternate tyranny and patronage of the powerful Baron on whose estates they had been thrown. But in the year 1179, Hugh de Mortimer, at length earnest about the foundation of Wigmore Abbey, endowed it with (inter alia) the Advowson of Cheilmarsh. This Hugh, second Baron of Wigmore, died Feb. 26, 1185, leaving Roger, his eldest son, his heir, and three other sons. 3 Monasticon, VI, 345, Num. ii."], [58, "38 CHELMARSH. Among the latter was Hugh de Mortimer, the second recorded Lord of Chelmarsh, viz. to whom, with his wife Felicia de Sancto Sydonio, Hugh his Father had granted that Manor, together with Suddebury (Sidbury). Hugh Lord of Chelmarsh and Sidbury was slain in a Tourna ment at Worcester. Apparently he left no issue ; and Felicia his Widow, surviving him, surrendered Chelmarsh to the Lord of the Fee, viz. to Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, elder Brother of her deceased husband. For this the Baron paid 24 merks, as the circumstantial if not accurate Writer, whom I quote, informs us. Roger, third Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, died, says the same authority, \"June 24, 1215.\" Altering this date by a year, into June 24, 1214,4 I proceed to state that in his lifetime this Roger had enfeoffed his eldest Son, Hugh, in Chelmarsh. Hugh, on succeeding to his Father, trans ferred the Manor to Ralph, called his half-brother, but dying without issue5 on November 10, 1227, the said Feoffee became his heir and fifth Baron of Wigmore. Ralph de Mortimer had by his wife, Gladuse, daughter of Llewellyn Prince of Wales, several sons, of whom I only mention here Roger, the eldest, and Hugh. Chelmarsh, as usual, became the Appanage of the younger son, Hugh,6 but did not, as in former instances, revert again to the Suzerain, for Hugh transmitted it to his descendants. Of him and them I am now to speak, as consti tuting that line of \" Mortimer of Chelmarsh\" which, though hardly of Baronial Rank, was of an importance very proximate. The Manor of Chelmarsh was not the only benefit said to have been conferred by Ralph de Mortimer on his son Hugh. He is also alleged to have procured from Eudo la Zouche, unto whom the King had granted it, the marriage of Agatha de Ferrers, and there upon to have wedded her to his said Son.7 This statement requires some qualification, with which a little attention to chronology will supply us. \u2014 4 Stapleton' s Rot. Normanni\u00e6, II, cxxi, points out this correction. Mortimer. My reference to the Charter- Roll does not enable me to verify this quo tation, but the alleged fact probably rests on some other sufficient authority. The year indicated (1246) was that of Ralph de Mortimer's death. 5 \"Unmarrfed,\" says the Chronicle, but not truly. ' Mr. Dukes (Antiquities, p. 246) quotes Cart. 30 Hen.

Agatha de Ferrers was the youngest of seven daughters born to that William Earl Ferrers who died in 1254, by his first wife Sibil, sister and, in her issue, Coheir of Anselm, last Earl Marshal of his line. Agatha, being Coheiress of her Mother, was entitled to a pro portion of her said Mother's estate, that is, to a seventh part of a fifth share of the Honour of Marshal Earl of Pembroke. Being a Coheiress to this extent, her marriage was at the disposal of the King; but in 36 Hen. Ill (1251-2) her Father, William Earl Ferrers, obtained from the Crown the Custody of his daughter Agatha, on condition that she should not marry without the King's license.8 Now, whereas Ralph Lord Mortimer died in 1246, it is obvious that his son Hugh's marriage with Agatha de Ferrers was not by the Father's procurement. In July 1253, Eudo la Zouche proffered to the King a fine of 150 merks to have the marriage of Agatha de Ferrers, if the Earl her Father would consent to such marriage. His Fine was accepted, \" but if Eudo should not eventually have the said marriage nor the value thereof,\" the whole debt of \u00a3100 was to be remitted.9 It would appear from the Patent Rolls of a following year (1255) that she then married Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh.10 Hugh, like his elder Brother Roger, was steady in the Royal cause in 1265. In 1266, attending the King at the famous siege of Kenilworth, and losing his horse in that service, the King, in compensation, excuses a debt of 40 merks which his faithful and beloved Hugh de Mortimer and Agatha, Coheir of the Earls Marshal, wife of the said Hugh, owed to the Crown in respect of the debts of the said Earls.11 But I must return to say something of this Hugh's possession of Chelmarsh, which seems, after all, to have been neither undis- puted nor complete. 8 Claus. 36 Hen.

On April 29, 1255, the King appoints William Trussell, as \"Justiciar to take an assize of novel disseizin which Hugh de Mortimer had arraigned against Roger de Mortimer concerning his tenement in Cheylmers.\" 12 In the summer of the same year, the Stottesden Jurors gave the following account of this Manor : \u2014 \" Hugh de Mortimer is Lord of Cheylmerse, in which are five hides of land geldable, and he does (suit) to the County and Hun dred; \u2014 whereof the aforesaid Hugh holds the whole except 4\\ virgates which Roger de Mortimer holds with the capital messuage, three Mills, and one gorth?3 and he does (suit) to the Hundred by Hugh de Sutton his Attorney, and pays the Sheriff 10</. for Stretward and 26d. for Motfee.\" The latter liability, I should observe, is at half the usual rate; \u2014 other Manors in Stottesden Hundred were assessed at 4d. and 8c?. per hide to the charges of Stretward and Motfee.u The next document which I have to quote in relation to Chelmarsh, shows that Roger de Mortimer continued to hold not only the seigneury of, but a very considerable demesne interest in the Manor. On the 9th of November 1266, King Henry III, then at Kenilworth, granted to Roger de Mortimer and his heirs, that they should hold their Manor of Cleybury and Chelmarsh, with its members, quit of all tallages, suits of County or Hundred, and all other customs accruing to the King from the said Manor and its members; \u2014 so that no Sheriff, Bailiff, or Minister of the King should enter the said Manor or its members to levy any distress in respect of such dues aforesaid ; but that the said Roger should hold the same with sak and sok, &c. and free from all pleas, and from (amercements for) larceny, murders, blodwyte, forstall, hamsok, &c.15 These privileges, which the King granted at instance of Prince Edward, were extended by Mortimer to Sidbury, Nene Savage, and other Manors which he chose to consider members of Cleobury and Chelmarsh. Hence in 1292, Edmund de Mortimer, son and heir of Roger, was sued by the Crown under writ of Quo Waranto.

Let us now return to the principal Feoffee in the Manor. Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh served as Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire from March 10, 1271, till his death,17 whereupon Letters Patent, of date January 23, 1273, appoint Ralph de Mortimer to the custody of those Counties, and of the Castles of Shrewsbury and Bruges, for which trust he is to be answerable at the Exchequer \" as Hugh de Mortimer deceased, late Constable and Sheriff, used to be.\" Hugh appears to have been buried at Wigmore.18 Ralph de Mortimer, Successor of Hugh in the Shrievalty, was his nephew ; \u2014 son and heir apparent of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, but who never succeeded to that Barony, owing to his early death. Hugh's Successor in estate was his own second Son, Henry, for his elder Son, John, appears to have died before his Father and without issue. But Agatha de Ferrers, Hugh's Widow, long survived him. Under name of Agatha de Mortimer, she had summons to send her service for the Muster against Lewelin, which was to take place at Worcester on July 1, 1277.19 In 1284, the Sheriff of Shropshire returned Agatha de Mortimer as still owing to the Crown a sum of \u00a331. 6s. %\\d., being on account of her share of the inheritance of the Earl Marshal, which had previously been assessed upon her in the accounts of the Sheriff of Herefordshire.20 As holding lands in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire to the annual value of \u00a340. and upwards, she was included in the military sum mons of 1300, when Muster was to be at Carlisle, on June 24, against the Scots.21 On July 12, 1306, the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum 16 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 677.

Her estates lay in Bedfordshire, Dorsetshire, and in Ireland. Henry de Mortimer, her son and heir, was on one Inquest stated to be upwards of 30, on two other Inquests to be 40 years of age.22 Henry de Mortimer of Chelmarsh, of whom I proceed to speak, was probably at his Mother's death as old or older than any of these Inquests would lead us to think ; for, as early as the year 1286, he was entered on the Shropshire Pipe Roll as son and heir of Hugh de Mortimer, formerly Sheriff, and as liable for certain undischarged debts of his said Father entered on the Roll of 1278.23 In 1297, Henry de Mortimer was returned from the County of Salop as holding lands and rents of the annual value of \u00a320., and so summoned to perform Military service in parts beyond the Seas ; the Muster being fixed for July 7, at London.24 In 1306, the King accepted his homage as heir of Agatha his Mother.25 He had military summons for Sept. 29, 1309, to serve against the Scots. He attended the Parliament of Westminster in August 1312 as a Knight of the Shire of Salop. In 1316, he is returned as Lord of the Townships of Halmonds Froome, in Herefordshire, and of Chelmarsh and Aston juxta Caus, in Shropshire.26 Various Inquisitions, in pursuance of the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum, dated October 25, 1317, were held after the death of Sir Henry de Mortimer. He had held in capite a sixth of the Manor of Luton, Bedfordshire, by service of a sixth part of half a knight's-fee. He had held the Manor of Cheylmersh of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, by service of half a fee : also the hamlet of Aston (juxta Caus) of Peter Corbet by one sixth of a fee. Conjointly with his wife Custancia he had held certain tenements at the Lyehalle, which had been settled by fine on him and his said wife conjointly, with remainder to their heirs, of their bodies, and with further remainder to the right heirs of Henry. This tenure was under Hugh de Dudemaston, in free socage and by a penny rent. His Son and Heir, Hugh de Mortimer, was on all hands stated to have attained his full age of 21 years on August 1 previous.27 All that I shall further say of this Sir Hugh de Mortimer is, 23 Inquisitions, 34 Edw.

On this event the male issue of Sir Hugh above mentioned was found to be extinct, whilst his heir general was John de Cressi Junior, Great Grandson of his daughter Joan. On failure of this line also, the title to Chelmarsh is assigned by a Monastic Chronicle to Richard Plantagenet Duke of York, as representing the Earls of March, whose ancestor, Ralph de Mortimer of Wigmore, had granted Feoffment in the Manor to his second Son.29 I have attempted to express these facts in a tabular form, together with others which are derived from more authoritative documents than a Monastic Chronicle. \u2014 One account implies that Hugh de Mortimer, who died in 1372, having long before (viz. in 1344) settled his estates by fine, had a third daughter, Matilda, not mentioned in that fine. At all events a claim was set up on behalf of one apparently alleged to be descended from this third daughter. If justly, then the right heirs of Hugh de Mortimer, after the line of Cressi became extinct, were of a family named Redebergh, and not the Earl of March, then Duke of York, unless indeed the Redeberghs became extinct also. However, the Inquisitions which go to prove this heirship of the Redeberghs are incompatible with other established facts.30 Matilda must have been born at least as early as 1305 ; but we know that at that period her ostended Father (Hugh) was under 10 years of age. The probability is that Matilda was in truth a Mortimer, but not Daughter of that Hugh who died in 1372, as the Inquests imply. Sup posing her to have been daughter of the Hugh de Mortimer who died in 1273, or in any way descended from him, her issue will still have been nearer representatives of Mortimer of Chelmarsh than was the Duke of York. However, I am unable to assign to Matilda her proper place in the annexed Pedigree. 23 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 1200 \u2022\u2014 where some further particulars are given of this Sir Hugh, whom Mr. Blakeway however thought to have been of Richards- Castle : the last Mortimer of that house died in 1304. 29 Monasticon, V, 271.

Of Under-tenants in this Manor, at any early period, I can say very little. The Seigneury which Mortimer of Wigmore had here was invested with most exclusive privileges, while the tenure of Mortimer of Chelmarsh eclipsed all minor interests. Chelmarsh was, in short, a Manor of that class whose affairs were usually con fined to a local Court, and were seldom heard of among the general business of the County or in the Halls of Westminster. In Michaelmas Term, 1228, Agnes, daughter of Alexander Say (or Saxy), was suing Roger Russel for 1 virgate in Cheilmerse; which in the following Term (Hilary 1229) she recovered through default of the Defendant.31 At the Assizes of January 1256, Hugh de Mortimer and six others were found to have disseized Hugh de Sutton of a right of common in Chaumers. \u2014 Sutton was a member of Chelmarsh.32 The Mortimers of Wigmore retained, as I have said, for a time much of this Manor in Demesne. I offer one or two instances illustrative of this reservation ; and, though the transactions alluded to are later than my general plan contemplates, they will explain a part of the annexed Pedigree, and will also correct some very erroneous statements which I have met with on the subject. In 1361, one Henry de Mortimer was holding a messuage, Mill, a carucate of land, 4 acres of meadow, and 60s. annual rent in Chelmarsh, for life, with reversion to Edmund, son and heir of Roger de Mortimer, late Earl of March. These premises, held under the said Edmund, then in minority, Henry had a Royal license, dated July 13, to surrender to his Infant Suzerain.33 \u2014 There is no probability that this Henry de Mortimer was the so named son and presumptive heir of Hugh de Mortimer, then (1361) Lord of Chelmarsh. I take the Life-Tenant to be identical with that Sir Henry de Mortimer who appears, as brother of Sir Hugh, attesting a Deed of Guy Lord of Upton at this identical period,3* and as otherwise concerned in this neighbourhood. On Dec. 6, 1379, Edmund de Mortimer Earl of March had a Royal License to grant his Manor of Chelmarsh, called Nether court, to the Abbey of Wigmore.35 Notwithstanding that alienation, we are told that, in 1414, 31 Placita de eisdem Terminis, mem branes 11 dorso and 10 recto. 34 Blakeway MSS.

The earliest notice which we have of a Church here consists in the grant ofthe Advowson thereof to Wigmore Abbey in 1179. In 1291, the Church of Cheylmarsh is valued at \u00a310., being appropriated to the Abbey of Wigmore. \u2014 The Vicar's portion therein was less than \u00a34.37 However, in 1341, the aggregate Taxation of Cheylemersche Church is stated to be \u00a314. The Parish was rated to the Ninth at \u00a35. 10s. only, for several reasons : \u2014 there were neither sheep nor lambs therein ; 14 virgates of land lay unfilled, the Tenants having quitted ; also the Glebe, hay tithe, offerings and other small tithes, which went to swell the ecclesiastical value, realized \u00a35. 6s. 8d. per annum, and were not to be estimated in the present assessment.38 In 1345, Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh erected and endowed a Chantry or Chapel, dedicated to St. James, in this Church. He granted a messuage and \u00a33. 2s. 4d. annual rent to a Chaplain, to perform daily service in the said Chapel for the soul of the said Hugh. The Inquest, which found that the proposed grant would be uninjurious to the Crown, stated the premises to be held of Henry de Mortimer and of Roger de Mortimer, and that the Grantor would be receiving \u00a340. per annum in Chelmarsh after the pro posed grant had been carried into effect.39 36 Ibidem. The Calendar of Escheats (vol. iv, p. 93,) would lead to the in- ference that on the death of this Edmund in 1424, he was seized of 2 Knights' Fees in Chelmarsh, held under him by Hugh and Henry de Mortimer. The male line of Mortimer of Chelmarsh had however expired long before. The list of Fees here alluded to seems to me to be a compilation from one or more older Feodaries of the Honour of Mortimer. Certainly many of the entries describe a state of things no longer existing in 1424, nor, as I think, at any one previous period. 37 Pope Nich. Taxation, p. 166.

He was however his Son, and at this period, 1345, the only real Feoffee .in the Manor (his Brother Henry's tenure being merely for life). His being said in the Inquest to hold under Henry de Mortimer, as well as under Roger (of Wigmore), his chief Suzerain, is easily explained. A Fine had been levied in 1344, between Hugh deMor timer, of Chelmarsh, Senior, and Henry de Mortimer (obviously his eldest Son), whereby Hugh surrendered Chelmarsh to said Henry and the heirs of his body, with divers reversions to the Brethren and Sisters of said Henry, as enumerated in the annexed Pedigree.

That the famous Edric Forester should, as in the present instance, be described with such little distinction as is implied in the term \" a free-man\" seems at first improbable. Nevertheless the identity is unquestionable, for Mortimer's succession to Edric was not confined to these Shropshire Manors, and one instance which I will quote supplies us with a key to all. Mortimer held the Herefordshire Manor of Boritune in 1086.2 The Saxon Lord had been Edric, over whose name is written, in Domesday, the word \" Salvage,\" \u2014 the Norman appellation for him who was called by the Chroniclers Sylvaticus. The fact being ascertained, that certain estates of Edric Forester were bestowed on Mortimer, we find also the reason thereof. \u2014 This illustrious Saxon was the Son of \u00c6lfric, one of the six brethren of that Edric Streon who, though born of lowly parentage, had obtained the Earldom of Mercia in the time of Ethelred the Unready. The talents and eloquence of Edric Streon were associated with other qualities in which he is said to have surpassed all his Con temporaries. Pride, Cruelty, and Perfidy are lenient terms as 1 Domesday, so. 257, a. 1. I 2 Ibidem, so. 183, b. 1."], [71, "49 EUDON GEORGE. applied to the character of this Monster. He commenced his career of crime in the year 1006 with the assassination of the Ealdorman \u00c6lfhelm, his guest and supposed friend, at Shrewsbury. There is much reason to think that this was with the approbation of King Ethelred, who in the following year gave him the Earldom of the Province in which Shropshire lay. Repeatedly a Traitor to Ethelred as well as to his heroic Son Edmund, Edric Streon was at first no loser by the accession of Canute, who had profited often by his perfidy, and who reinvested him with the Earldom of Mercia as soon as he himself had secured the throne. The prudence of the Dane was however stronger than his gratitude, and ere he had reigned a year, he put Edric to death, on the bare supposition that a miscreant who had betrayed all his former benefactors might once again pursue the same course. This was in the year 1017; and it was perhaps in consequence of Edric Streon's tenure of the Earldom of Mercia, that his Nephew, Edric Savage, is found in the time of King Edward (1041-1066) to have enjoyed considerable possessions in that Province. In the year after the Norman Conquest, the \" Child Edric \" was manfully resisting the progress of events in the West. Though Richard Fitz Scrobi and other Norman Settlers in Herefordshire frequently laid waste the lands of Edric, they never encountered Edric himself without considerable loss. In the Autumn too the Saxon assumed the offensive, and, associating himself with two Welsh Princes, he devastated Here fordshire to the banks of the Lug, and retired with a booty cor responding to so bold an enterprise. The next intelligence which we have of Edric Sylvaticus is of his adhesion to King William. This was in 1070. In the following year he shared neither the rebellion nor the forfeiture of Earls Edwin and Morkar ; and in 1072, accompanied William on that famous expedition into Scotland when King Malcolm is said to have acknowledged the right as well as the power of the Conqueror by a formal act of homage. For further accounts of Edric, I must now turn to a less trust worthy authority than the accurate Historian on whom I have thus far depended.3 The Annalist of the Mortimers (whom I have already quoted, under Chelmarsh) tells us how Ralph de Mortimer was sent by King William against Edric \"Earl of Salop\" and Lord of Wygemore and Melenyth; \u2014 how, after long siege of 3 Florence of Worcester. iii. 7"], [72, "50 EUDON GEORGE. Wygemore Castle, Mortimer gained possession of both the person and estates of his opponent; \u2014 how he led him in bonds to the King, to be consigned to perpetual imprisonment; \u2014 how, lastly, Mortimer proceeded to fortify the Castle of Dynethe, in Melenyth, which Edric had built.* Such is perhaps the joint meaning of two not quite consistent passages in which the Chronicler alludes to the same events. It is, however, immaterial to ascertain the exact meaning of a Writer who had no knowledge of the details of his subject. His entitling Edric Silvaticus \" Earl of Salop \" is of course an error.5 \u2014 Moreover, it is all but certain, from Domesday, that Wigmore, as an estate, had never belonged to Edric Sylvaticus; that, as a Castle, it was neither built or ever held, even for a day, by Edric or any other Saxon. It was, in fact, the work of Earl William Fitz Osbern, who built it \" on waste land, called Merestun, which belonged to Gunnert in King Edward's time.\" 6 All then that I venture to conclude on this subject is, that sometime between 1072 and 1085, Edric Sylvaticus forsook his allegiance to King William; \u2014 that William Fitz Osbern Earl of Hereford, being dead, Mortimer was deputed by the King to reduce Edric ; that Mortimer succeeded in so doing, and obtained many of the forfeited estates of Edric as a reward for this service ; but that he became Lord of Wigmore as the King's principal Lieutenant in Herefordshire, after the forfeiture of Earl Roger de Britolio in 1074. The fate of Edric Sylvaticus is unchronicled, for the loose words of the Mortimer Annalist, which point to death in prison, can only be taken as indicating the Writer's ignorance of any specific fact. A genealogical enthusiast would have little hesitation in assuming as a conclusion, the possibility that several estates, which, having been Edric's, were afterwards held under Mortimer by a family surnamed Savage, were so held in virtue of a lineal descent from the said Edric Salvage. Such an assumption can only be rendered plausible by recurrent hints, for positive evidence on matters of this nature is out of the question. At present therefore, neither assenting to, nor rejecting this hypothesis, I proceed to say that Eudon was, in time of King Stephen or Henry II, held under 4 Monasticon, VI, p. 349, No. iii. 6 An error paralleled however by that of another Chronicler, who, speaking of Edric's Father \u00c6lfric, calls him Earl of Mercia, a title to which he never could have had any pretence.

Mortimer of Wigmore by William le Salvage, who, holding also Neen and Walton under the same Baron, left with all three Manors their distinctive names of Eudon Savage, Neen Savage, and Walton Savage.7 This William le Salvage left a son and heir, Adam, and a daughter, Geva, who, having been wife of Herbert de Tenbury, and mother by him of two daughters, Alice and Felicia, granted, apparently in her widowhood, but before the year 1185, certain land in Cornewode to Haughmond Abbey.8 Contemporary with Geva de Tenbury was her Brother Adam le Salvage, a principal Feoffee under Mortimer of Wigmore, and a person of much consideration in the County, as will appear by frequent mention which I shall, under other localities, have to make of him.9 Not attempting to decide the exact period when this Adam was succeeded by a Son of the same name and of equal consequence, I proceed to state that the latter was deceased in 1221, without issue, and that his representatives were the Survivors of his six Sisters, in common with the heirs of such of those Sisters as were then already dead. The three surviving Sisters were, Christiana le Sauvage (apparently unmarried), Margery, wife of Walter de Verdun, and Rohese de Pedewurdin (apparently a widow) . I can only indicate the families into which the three deceased Sisters had probably married by reference to the names of those who afterwards appear concerned in the representation of Adam le Savage. Amongst these, De Eudon, De Overton, De St. George, and De Boys, are the most prominent.10 Adam de Eudon was clearly son and heir of one of Adam le Savage's Sisters. This is proved by a deed whereby, about the year 1240,\u2014 \" Adam de Eudon gave to Sir Ralph de Mortimer all the land which he had in the Manor of Neine (Neen- Savage).

At a later period, he too is found to be more directly interested in those particular estates which had constituted the tenure of Adam le Savage. \u2014 A deed remains among the Wigmore Evidences, which, from its attesting witnesses, I judge to be nearly contemporary with the deed last quoted, and which indicates, as I believe, the various Manors in which Adam le Savage had had an interest. By this deed \" William de St. George quit-claims to Sir Ralph de Mortimer all his right in the services of those Knights'-Fees which he had claimed in the Curia Regis for land which Adam de Eudon held of him (Ralph) in Neen, and all his right in all things which could accrue to said Adam in Neen by right hereditary, viz., in the homages and services of one knight's-fee in Walleford and Letton, of one knight's-fee in Sete (Sheet) and Letton, of half a knight's-fee in Eudon, of half a knight's-fee in Neen, of one knight's-fee in Stepley (Stepple) and Anna, of one knight's-fee in Rugge (Rudge), and of one knight's-fee in Overton and Cornley. \u2014 To hold to Ralph and his heirs for ever, as far as the Grantor and his heirs were concerned.\" 13 These Deeds, taken conjunctively, evidently point to William de St. George and Adam de Eudon as sharers in Savage's fief. It appears however, from subsequent evidences, that William de St. George's Quit-claim to Ralph de Mortimer did not eventually exclude him from Savage's other estates nor from Eudon. About the year 1240, William de St. George held a knight's-fee in Neen and Eudon, and Geoffrey de Overton held a knight's fee in Overton, Eudon, and Cornley, under Ralph de Mortimer.13 Another share of Eudon, held neither by Overton nor by St. George, is unnoticed in the Record which I now cite.

In 1243, I find William de St. George amerced half a merk for false claim; and in 1245, a similar charge is made upon him for non-prosecution of some suit.14. In 1251, William de St. George was involved in litigation. \u2014 \u25a0 Justices are appointed to adjudicate in a cause where 24 Knights were to convict 12 men, who, having been Jurors in an assize of novel disseizin which he had against Ralph de la Lawe concerning some boundaries in Neen, had, I suppose, given an unfair verdict. Also, William de St. George was himself impleaded under writ of novel disseizen by Geoffrey de Overton, whom he had deprived of some tenement in Eudon.15 In 1255, we have a full account of the status of Eudone. William de Saint George, Robert Corbet, and Geoffrey de Overton were its Lords. Of the eight virgates which the Manor contained three were held by William de St. George, together with his share of Neen (if that be the meaning of an obscure expression in the Record). He did suit to the Hundred, but not to the County, and he owed seven and-a-half clays' ward at his Suzerain's Castle of Wigmore. Robert Corbet held two virgates, for which he owed similar suit to the Hundred-Court, and five days' ward at Wigmore in time of war. Geoffrey de Overton's share was three virgates, two whereof are expressed to pertain to (his neighbouring Manor of) Overton. Suit of Hundred and seven days' ward at Wigmore were liabilities attached to his share of the Manor. Eudon, collec tively, paid 8d. to the Sheriff for Stretward, and 16c?. for Motfee?6 The Assizes of January 1256, again exhibit William de St. George as involved in litigation. He sued Ralph d'Arraz, Henry de Sutbir' (Sidbury), Walter le Berner, and Nicholas le Provost, for disseizing him of 5 acres in Neen. Ralph d'Arraz answered for all the Defendants, showing that the Plaintiff had formerly demised the premises to one William Fitz Robert, and that, through the latter, he, Ralph, had obtained ingress therein ; moreover, that the cause had already been decided before Simon de Wauton, to the Record of whose judicial acts the said Ralph now appealed.

He prosecuted Geoffrey de Overton, William and Nicholas, sons of said Geoffrey, Thomas le Thorpe and Thomas Fitz Roger, alleging them to have disseized him of a parcel of Wood in Heudon Sawage. Of the Defendants, Thomas Fitz Roger was already deceased, and William, son of Geoffrey de Overton, alone appeared, being seized of the said parcel of Wood under gift of Geoffrey his Father. The defence was that there was no disseizin, for the Plaintiff had never been seized, and the Wood was Geoffrey de Overton's own. William de Saint George was again found to be in misericordid?8 Another trial at these Assizes related to an estate at Walford (near Brompton Brian, Herefordshire). It was a member of the Fief once held by Adam le Savage. I mention the matter here, because I think it furnishes us with a list of persons who all, or mostly, were contemporary representatives of the said Adam. They were, William de St. George, Geoffrey de Overton, Adam de Heudon (Eudon), Roger de Foxcote, Nicholas de Hyntes, William son of William de Hyntes (a Minor), Nicholas de Pedwardine, and Richard de Bosco (Boys).19 Lastly, at these same Assizes, Richard de Boys appears as suing Robert Corbet for his interest here, viz., for \" one-sixth of 2 caru cates in Newedon,\" as the Record has it, but which, I doubt not, represents Robert Corbet's estate in Eudon George. Robert Corbet not appearing, the land was ordered to be seized into the King's hand, and the cause was adjourned to Easter Term. It was afterwards shown that Corbet was beyond sea.20 Very apposite to this law-suit, but leaving something still to be explained regarding the precise relation of the Litigants, is a Deed among the Wigmore Evidences, whereby, later, as I think, in the Century\u2014\" Richard de Boys grants to Sir Robert Corbet all that share of land which by hereditary right devolved on said Richard in the Manor of Eudon Savvages :\u2014 rendering therefore Id. annually to the Grantor, and all services due to the Crown and to the Lords of the Fee.\" 31 Of Robert Corbet and his Successors at Chetton I have given ls Ibidem.

Before 1269, William de St. George seems to have been suc ceeded at Eudon by Adam de St. George, who attests a Charter of the said Robert Corbet, as already stated.33 Adam de St. George was not at this time a Knight, but appears as such, attesting a grant to his Suzerain, Roger de Mortimer, who died in 1282. Again, in 1296, Sir Adam de St. George attests a Charter at Cleobury Mortimer, wherein Edmund Lord Mortimer was Grantee.24 To Adam succeeded John de St. George, who, in February 1305, was found by Inquest to be holding a knight's fee in Eudon of the Barony of Edmund de Mortimer, then lately deceased ; nor is any other Tenant in the Manor mentioned.25 Another change seems soon to have followed, for the Feodary of 1316, called the Nomina Villarum, gives Henry de Eudon as sole Lord of Eudon Jory?& I imagine that the real name of this Henry was St. George, for that family certainly held the Manor at a later period; and left with it its distinctive name of Eudon George, as a substitute for the older name of Eudon Savage.

Azor, the Saxon owner, was, I suppose, the same whom we have noticed as Lord of Burwarton, and of whom we shall again hear in places more remote. Of Roger, the Domesday Tenant of Neenton, I can say nothing positively. Probably it was he or his immediate Successor who, being entitled Lord of Neuton, is mentioned about 1138 as having granted two-thirds of his Tithes to Shrewsbury Abbey, or to the Church of St. Gregory at Morville.2 In 1180, we hear of one William who is put in charge for an imbladement in Neenton, viz., 6d. for one acre of oats. He, I doubt not, was Father of that Roger Fitz William of Newenton of whom we hear as deceased in 1221 ; and apparently without issue, for Stephen de Lodhal then sued Henry de Fernlawe, the Tenant, for three virgates in Newenton, which Stephen claimed in right of his wife Margery, sister of the said Roger Fitz William. The Tenant not appearing at Shrewsbury Assizes (Nov. 1221), the case was adjourned to Warwick,* where, on January 14, 1222, the Tenant appeared, and called Geoffrey de Ledwich to warranty.5 A further adjourn ment to Westminster, and the loss of a Record, prevent our tracing the result. My impression is that, within twenty years of this time, both Neenton and Sidbury devolved to an heir female, viz., Joan or Jane, wife of Ralph d'Arraz. Hence, or from some other cause, we find that about 1240, Ralph d'Arraz is entered as holding two knights' fees in Sodburi and Nenton under Mortimer of Wigmore. G This Ralph d'Arraz, as I learn from a deed a little later, was a Knight. Retransmitted both Neenton and Sidbury to his descend ants ; but I cannot distinctly mark the early stages of this succes sion, inasmuch as the same Christian name, Ralph, was common to several generations. To prove that Neenton came to the first Ralph with his wife Joan, the following fine, levied 25th Nov. 1248, must suffice : \u2014 Thereby John de Bollinton, Tenant, surrendered to said Ralph 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 334.

John surrendered it as the right of Joan, and moreover he gave up a virgate-and-half, being all the land which he held under the Plaintiffs, to hold to Ralph and Joan and the heirs of Joan. For this he received 30 merks.7 On December 26, 1250, I find Ralph d'Araz and Joan his wife giving the King one merk for a writ of \" Pone usque Westminster.\"8 This doubtless was a preliminary removal of the suit, which was on trial soon after, wherein Joan claimed against the Lord of Glazeley a considerable estate at Wadley. The particulars of the case, as of another suit wherein Ralph d'Arraz was Defendant, have been already given.9 In 1254, Ralph d'Arraz was specially exempted from a fine of 100 merks, which was assessable on the County in general.10 In 1255, Neynton is entered as a Manor of half a hide (its Domesday measurement), which Ralph d'Arraz held of Roger de Mortimer \" for service of one knight, pertaining to Wygmore.\" It owed suit to the Hundred of Stottesdon, but not to the County. It paid the Sheriff 2d. for Stretward, and 4d. for Motfee?1 At the Salop Assizes, January 1256, Sir Ralph d'Arraz appears as a Knight and Juror, also as Defendant in a cause already recited, which concerned a purchase he had made in Neen Savage.12 On June 16, 1259, he was one of the Knights who adjudicated on an important Inquest as to the immunities of Wenlock Priory. In the same year he was, as a Coroner of the County, amerced 20s. \" for many transgressions.\" 13 From this period till Sept. 1272, Ralph d'Arraz, Knight, often occurs as a witness ; and at the Assizes then held, the same person, or a second of the same name, appears as a Knight and Juror, and as being, or having been, one of the King's Coroners in Shropshire.

In 1292, Ralph d'Arraz sat on the Jury which was empanelled to try many causes of Quo Waranto in this County.15 As holding \u00a320. of lands and upwards in Shropshire, he was included in a general summons to attend at London on July 7, 1297, prepared with horse and arms for foreign service.16 An account of the Fees of Edmund de Mortimer deceased, which was taken at Shrewsbury Feb. 10, 1305, records Ralph d'Arraz as holding \" Sondbury and Neuton \" by service of two knights.17 The Feodary of March 1316 omits all mention of Neenton, but, as printed, gives Ralph Barraz as Lord of Sutbury.18 In 1320-1, Adam d'Araz presented to the Church of Neenton; and in 1321, I have notice of Adam d'Arraz among the followers of Roger Lord Mortimer of Wigmore.19 He, I presume, was the same person who with Andrea his wife, in 1348, appears to have made a settlement of the Manor of Sidbury.20 Of Under-tenants in this Manor I have no particulars, further than is implied above, or may be gathered from a Fine levied in 1328, whereto Hugh, son of Warine de Neinton, Johanna his wife, and Thomas, Parson of the Church of Neinton, are parties.21 THE CHURCH. When, before the year 1138, the Lord of Neenton gave two parts of his tithes to Shrewsbury Abbey, the third part was probably reserved in anticipation of a future, rather than in consideration for an existing parochial Church. In 1291, the Church of Neuton, in Stottesden Deanery, was valued at \u00a35. 6s. 8c?., but this was exclusive of a portion of 16s. which the Abbot of Shrewsbury retained therein,22 which portion, I doubt not, was in commutation of tithes surrendered at the time of the Church's foundation. In 1341, the gross value of Neinthton Church is consistently laid at \u00a36. 2s. 8d. The Parish was however taxed only 31s. to the Ninth for these reasons. \u2014 It possessed no sheep or lambs ; a carucate of land lay untilled ; Tenants had quitted under pressure of poverty ; and small tithes, 16 Placita de quo Waranto, p. 674. 16 Parliamentary Writs, I, 291. 19 Ibidem, IV, 756. 20 Dukes' Antiquities, p. 257. \"\"* Inquisitions, 32 Edw.

In demesne are n ox-teams, and (there are) vi Serfs, vi Villains, and in Boors, with ii teams ; and 11 other teams more might be here. In time of King Edward, the Manor was worth 20s. (annually), and afterwards was waste. Now it is worth 18s.1 The first whom I can name as likely to have been Mortimer's Feoffee here, was Hugh de Sudberi, who appears in Easter Term, 1200, as one of four Knights selected to choose a Jury, which was to try a cause of Grand Assize touching lands in Nordley Regis.2 This Sir Hugh de Sudburi appears as a Knight and Juror at the County Assizes of October 1203 : when also he accused Robert de Girros of unjustly seizing his hounds, but withdrew the cause, for which he seems to have been amerced half a merk, viz., pro falso clamore, as the Record has it.3 At the Forest Assizes, March, 1209, Hugh de Suthbery, appa rently a Regarder of Morf and Shirlot Forests, was amerced two merks. One Roger de Subiri, who, from his position in a testing clause already given,* was a person of importance, may have been Hugh's successor. I find no other mention of him than this, which was of date about 1227. How Sidbury became before 1240 the property of Ralph d'Arraz, and thenceforth associated with Neenton, I cannot conjecture. The previous Lords of each Manor seem to have been distinct, otherwise I should have concluded both to have been the inherit ance of Joan Lady of Neenton.

Ralph d'Arraz was Lord thereof, and held it im mediately of Roger de Mortimer for service of one knight, pertain ing to Wygemore. The Manor did suit to the Hundred, but not to the County, and paid the Sheriff 2d. for Stretward, and 4d. for Motfee? I have already made mention twice of a Henry de Sutbury, living in 1 256. 6 Him I take to have been an Under-tenant here of Ralph d'Arraz. On August 27, 1259, William, son of Alan de Wullaneston, is suing Ralph d'Arraz for disseizing him of his tenement in Mid dleton..7 Ralph had apparently extended his property into the adjoining Manor, now Middleton Scriven. This also he did in other directions, for in 1270, Hugh de Plessetis was prosecuting him for novel disseizin in Northwood, and Thomas Botterel for novel disseizin in Fowlewordin (Ful wardine), where indeed a subsequent interest of D'Arraz has been already pointed out.8 Again, in the same year (1270), Ralph d'Arraz and William de Lastres were defendants in another suit of novel disseizin in North wood, where Nicholas de Chorleye was Plaintiff.9 I have said under Neenton whatever else was to be said of this Manor or its Lords.

This district at the time of Domesday was reputed to be in the latter County, or else in Warwickshire, a matter which has been already discussed.1 At the accession of Henry II, as now, it was in Shropshire, and so comes properly under our notice. Four Manors of this district, viz. Claverley, Worfield, Nordley, and Alveley, had that in common which obliges me to say something of them collectively. They were all reputed to be in Staffordshire, though their Hundred is not. assigned in Domesday. They had in Saxon times formed one continuous estate of Algar Earl of Mercia. After the Conquest, they were granted in their integrity to the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury ; and in 1086, were held wholly in Demesne by him and his Son Hugh. Such was the magnificent estate, whose area, of more than 23,000 modern acres, included the great Forest of Morf, whose boundary was a broad and navigable River, whose advantages, in short, were such as to induce its Nor man Lord to found on its border his Castle and Church of Quatford. To speak more particularly of Claverley, we have, even in the name, some indication of a fertile soil, for Clover (Cl\u00e6pep) is a plant whose spontaneous growth is associated with almost every other agricultural capability. Domesday thus notices the Manor, at the head of the Stafford shire lands of Earl Roger.2 \u2014 \" Earl Roger holds Claverlege. Here are xx hides.

It is clear, from the Shropshire portion of the Survey, that the accounts given of a previous state of things (in time of King Edward) generally refer to a particular part of his reign. I conclude therefore that the Domesday Commissioners for Shropshire gathered these particulars from some written Record, not from the oral testimony of persons whose recollec tions would necessarily refer to various periods of a bygone \u00e6ra. This supposed pre-existing Record I further observe to contemplate that period of the Confessor's In this respect an anterior Record, to which the Domesday Commissioners for Staffordshire seem to have referred, was different ; for their notes mainly allude to a period when Algar was Earl of Mercia, i.e. between Aug. 31, 1057 (when Earl Leofric died) and 1059. However, the names of both Earl Morcar and Earl Ed win occur in the Staffordshire Survey, so that it would seem that the Commissioners consulted more than one pre-existing Re cord, or else admitted oral testimony."], [88, "64 CLAVERLEY. long and half a league wide. In time of King Edward the Manor was worth \u00a37. 10s. (annually). Now it is worth \u00a310.\" Of Claverley, as held by the Norman Earls, I can say no more than is implied by Earl Roger giving the whole tithes thereof, together with the Church, probably of his own building, to Quatford Collegiate Church. But Claverley was, in its subsequent history, so circumstanced, that I must needs treat of it as the type of a particular class of Manors, none of- which have yet come under notice ; \u2014 I say none, because Bridgnorth, in some respects similar, was a Manor un known at Domesday in the first instance, and became a Borough in the next. Those Manors, then of Shropshire which constituted, or rather were described, as \" ancient demesne of the Crown,\" were such as having been held in demesne by the Norman Earls of Shrewsbury till the expulsion of Belesme, and which, not being granted to any subject by Henry I, nor yet granted with any title of right by Stephen, came to the hands of Henry II, at or soon after his accession, as part of his personal estate. Among the first acts of that King's government, the resumption of his demesnes, and the restoration of his Exchequer, are recorded. The fiscal or reputed Ferm of the County of Salop, stood in his ninth year (1163), if not before, at the sum of \u00a3265. 15s. reckoned by tail (numero), being only \u00a31. Is. more than it had stood at in his second year (1156). And this Ferm of \u00a3265. 15s. remained technically unaltered at the accession of Edward I, in 1272.4 The Sheriff, as Fermor of the County, had it in hand, at his Michaelmas audit with the Exchequer, first to charge himself with this sum, and then to set forth his expenditure thereof, paying or receiving, taking or giving credit for, any balance, as the case might be. Having partly explained this before, it remains here to show how the Sheriff became accountable for the Gross Sum, that is, how he received it and whence it came. It was summarily the rent or income of the King's demesnes or other prerogatives in the County ; \u2014 not what the Sheriff actually received (he got much more), but what he was supposed to receive and was obliged to account for. To this Fund every Manor of Royal Demesne was presumed to furnish a specific quota. Of 4 It was however really increased by a fund termed the Proficuum Comitatiis, the amount of which was matter of special arrangement with the successive Sheriffs, and was accounted for distinctly from the fund called the Corpus Comitatiis."], [89, "65 CLAVERLEY. the \u00a3265. 15s. assessed on the County, \u00a315. was probably the Ferm of the King's Manor of Claverley. Of Claverley, as a whole, no grant in fee was made to any subject within the period of which I am speaking (1155-1272); but in the former year Henry II enfeoffed Robert de Girros in a portion thereof, viz. in Broughton. This part, fiscally reputed to be of 35s. annual value, was consequently excepted by the Sheriff from his own yearly responsibilities at the Exchequer. He claimed his exemption on the Pipe Roll in form following, under the head \" of lands given.\" \u2014 In terris datis. Et Roberto de Girros xxxv s. in Claverlai. Like Bridgnorth and other Demesnes of the Crown, Claverley and Worfield were assessable to Tallages, but they had also con siderable privileges. The Tenants thereof were, in all mercantile transactions throughout the realm, free from toll and other duties. At home they constituted a Manorial Court adequate both in mat ters civil and criminal, for almost all purposes of self-government. No trial about land of ancient demesne could ordinarily be had under the forms of Grand Assize or Novel Disseizin ; the only Writ current in these Manors was the King's Breve clausum de recto, which enjoined any dispute to be settled in the local Court, and according to local customs. The exclusive privileges which thus enabled a Manorial Court to perform most of the functions ordinarily devolving on a Bailiff of the Hundred, a Sheriff of the County, or on the King's Justices, have their effect on antiquarian researches. Our information about Manors of ancient demesne is generally scanty unless the local Court-Rolls happen to be preserved, a circumstance which, as regards the period we treat of, cannot be expected. What we do know of these Manors is usually of a different character from that which we know of ordinary estates ; \u2014 which observation I leave to be illus trated by the following details : \u2014 And first, as regards Tallages, \u2014 I will class those of Claverley, Worfield and Nordley together, so long as any two of the three Manors were assessed to that tax. In 1169, Worfield was taxed 2 merks to the auxilium for marrying the King's daughter. The men of Claverley paid 1 merk to the same. So also did the men of Norley. In 1174, the Assize, as it is called, of Worfield was \u00a38. 13s. 4d., that of Claverley \u00a33. 6s. 8d., that of Nordley \u00a32. 13s. 4d. In 1177, the \"Aid\" levied on each Manor was at the rate of \u00a310 \u00a32. 6s. Sd., and \u00a32. 13s. 4d. respectively. q III. y"], [90, "66 CLAVERLEY. In 1187, the Tallage of each was \u00a33. 2s. 6d., \u00a31. 14s. Od., and \u00a31. Os. 6d. In 1194-5, it was \u00a35. Os. Od., \u00a32. Os. Od., and\u00a3l. 6s. Sd. In 1199, two Tallages are recorded, the earliest in the proportion of \u00a310. Os. Od., \u00a32. 13s. 4d., and \u00a32. Os. Od.; the last in the proportion of \u00a310., \u00a34., and \u00a33. 6s. 8d. on each Manor. In 1203, the sums levied were \u00a36. 13s. 4d., \u00a31. 13s. 4d., and \u00a31. 13s. 4d. In 1205, they were \u00a33. Os. Od., \u00a31. 10s. Od., and \u00a32. 13s. 4d. In 1206, they were \u00a310. for Worfield, \u00a33. 6s. Sd. for Claverley, and \u00a33. 6s. Sd. for Nordley. In 1207, they were \u00a35. for Worfield, 13s. 4d. for Claverley, and \u00a32. for Nordley. In 1214, Worfield was assessed at \u00a310. Os. Od., Claverley at \u00a36. 13s. 4d., and Nordley not at all, unless the vill of \"Morton,\" assessed at \u00a32., was so written by mistake for Nordley. At all events, no later assessment of Nordley to a Tallage is on the Pipe Rolls. In 1223, Worfield was assessed \u00a35. and Claverley \u00a32. 13s. 4d. In 1227, \u00a310. 13s. 4d. and \u00a35. were the sums originally assessed, but they were reduced to \u00a38. and \u00a33. 6s. 8d. In 1230, the relative assessments on Worfield and Claverley were \u00a36. and \u00a33. 13s. 4d.; and in 1235, they were \u00a36. 13s. 4d. and \u00a33. 6s. Sd. Worfield was now, for obvious reasons, exempted from King's Tallages for a season.5 In 1242, Claverley was assessed at \u00a32.; in 1246, at \u00a38.; in 1249, at \u00a38.; in 1255, at \u00a312. 13s. 4d.; and in 1261, at \u00a313. 4s. 8d. In 1269, the last Tallage which I shall notice was assessed at \u00a312. on Worfield, and \u00a38. 14s. 4d. on Claverley.6 Pursuing my design of treating Claverley as a type of the King's Demesnes in Shropshire, I pass to another matter connected with 5 It passed in 1238 to Henry de Hast ings. Though not liable during Hastings' seizin to King's Tallages, it would appear that whenever the King levied a Tallage on his other demesnes, he permitted his Tenant at Worfield to assess that Manor for his own behoof. Hence the following writ from the Close-Rolls of 33 Hen. Ill, relative to the Tallage of 1249.\u2014 Quia Rex talliari fecit dominica sua, manda- turn est Vicecomiti quod habere facial Benrico de Bastings, rationabile talla gium de hominibus tenentibus in Mane riis de Cunedover et Worfeld, qu\u00e6 ali quando fuerunt dominica Regis.

It would seem that each Manor, or such part thereof as was held in hand, was stocked at the King's expense up to a definite standard, and that every Sheriff or other Fermor, on quittiug office, was expected to leave as much Stock as he had found on entry. That an account of Stock was taken on the succession of each Fermor is, I think, probable, but I can quote no instance of such precaution. I only know of cases where, the amount of Stock left on a Manor being suspected to be deficient, Inquisitions were ordered to ascertain the original amount found there, and according to the Verdict of such Inqui sitions the retiring Fermors were dealt with. But these deficiencies did not always arise from the carelessness or dishonesty of individual Officers. Great national disturbances left similar results behind them. \u2014 William Fitz Alan (first Sheriff of Shropshire after Henry II's restoration) had held office only three months when, at Michaelmas 1155, the first fiscal year of that King's reign ended. Fitz Alan's account, occupying perhaps only a small part of the lost Pipe Roll of that year, is epitomized in a few lines of the Red Book of Exchequer? It contains however a charge against the Crown of \u00a33. 5s. od. in \"waste of Manors\" during the said quarter; that is, the Sheriff claimed exemption from certain liabilities which the wasted state of some Manors disabled him from meeting. In 1156, the same Sheriff had expended no less than \u00a3145. 8s. 8d. in re-stocking the King's Manors throughout the County. He also charges \u00a317. 6s. 4d. for \"waste of the County\" (in Wasto Comitatus), that is, I suppose, on account of certain Manors which were not yet re-stocked, or were otherwise unproductive.8 The next occasion on which the Revenue arising from the King's Demesnes in Shropshire is found to have been generally deficient, was in the reign of John, and arose from different causes. Geoffrey Fitz Piers, succeeding to the Shrievalty in 1201, seems to have found several Manors in an unproductive state. In his first half-year of office he claims a deduction of \u00a322. 18s. 6d. out of the sum of \u00a3132. 17s. 6d. which constituted the Ferm of the County for that period.9 And this arose from the \"default of Manors,\" i.e., their inadequacy to produce the usual ferm because they were un-stocked. He considered that the deficiency should be made good by William Fitz Alan, the second of that name, and his predecessor in office. 7 Liber Ruber Scaccarii, so. clxxxv. 9 Rot. Cane. 3 John, p. 122. 8 Rot. Pip. 2 Hen. II, p. 43."], [92, "68 CLAVERLEY. Fitz Alan, it would seem, charged the blame still further back, viz., on Hugh Pantulf, who, though living, had ceased to be Sheriff twelve years. In 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, and 1206, Geoffrey Fitz Piers and his Successor, Thomas de Erdinton, claimed an annual deduction of \u00a345. 15s. 8d., on account of \"default or deduction\" of the Manors of Worfield, Claverley, Ford, Edgmond, and Condover. The actual deficiency of stock in each Manor is stated on the Pipe Roll of 1202. An example will suffice : \u2014 Worfield was deficient in 6 ox-teams, 600 sheep, 32 bee-stalls, 30 sows, and 24 cows, involving an annual loss of \u00a36., \u00a36., 32s., 30s., and 24s. on each respective item, and so \u00a316. 6s. in the aggregate. A note on the deduction of 1205 states Hugh Pantulf to be responsible for the deficiency ; but the matter as between him and Fitz Alan seems to have been mixed up with another question, viz., a similar waste or negligence in their custody of the stores of the Royal Castles. In 1207, the previous deficiency of \u00a345. 15s. Sd. is reduced to \u00a344. 9s. The Sheriff gives the reason. \u2014 He had 140 sheep in stock that year, which he had not iu previous years. In the years 1208 and 1209, the re-stocking of the Royal Manors seems to have been continued and completed. One Pipe Roll embraces the account of both years.

Pantulf accounts for \u00a3247. 8s. lOd. for \" default of stock in 8\u00a3 years of his time as Sheriff, which Stock he had, in part, kept back, whilst he should have surrendered it to the Sheriff, his Successor.\" He is also charged \u00a3112. 3s. for \"the price of that stock.\"\u2014 The first charge would seem to be in replacement of the loss of annual revenue already incurred, the last a part of the 10 The whole of these details are scored across in the Pipe Roll (10 John), as if intended to be obliterated.

Of his debt of \u00a3360. Is. 10^., Pautulf had paid \u00a3100, had been excused \u00a3240, and still owed \u00a320. Is. lOd. William Fitz Alan is similarly charged \u00a3119. 9s. 6d. \" for default of stock which he had in like manner retained,\" and \u00a355. 3s. 4d. for \"cost of said stock.\" His aggregate debt of \u00a3174. 12s. lOd. remained at present uudiminished.11 I will notice one more instance of extensive \"waste\" having befallen the Royal Demesnes of Shropshire. It belongs to that dismal period which closed the reign of King John, and transferred the Crown to his infant heir. Whether this waste arose from the excesses of the Barons' party, or whether the King, now that his Exchequer had no existence, was forced to raise money from his smallest personal resources, I cannot say. The return of peace exhibited the following results of civil discord : \u2014 In 1220 (4 Hen. Ill), Ranulph Earl of Chester, then Sheriff of Shropshire, claimed an allowance of \u00a3135. 17s. from the Crown, in respect of a loss of \u00a345. 5s. 8d. per annum, which, in the three expired years of his Shrievalty, he had incurred by deficiency of stock throughout the Manors of the County. In 1221, he was allowed \u00a345. 5s. 8d. on a similar account, and at the rate of \u00a315. 5s. 8d. per annum for the years 1222 and 1223, the deficiency being specially stated to exist in the Manors of Worfield, Claverley, Ford, and Cundover. In 1224, the Earl of Salisbury, as Sheriff, claimed \u00a321. 5s. 3\\d. for the deficiency proportioned to three quarters of the current year. In 1225, John Bonet, then Custos of the County, was allowed \u00a328. 6s. Sd. on the Ferm of the year, \"by reason of the deficiency of stock in the Manors of Shrop shire;\" and a similar allowance was made in 1226 and 1227. The Pipe Rolls tell us no more of this deficiency, already creating a loss of more than \u00a3300., nor how it was ultimately made good. A change in the system of accounts seems to have taken place on John Bonet's quitting office as Custos, or perhaps the succeeding Sheriff, Henry d' Audley, undertook the ferm of the Counties on a \" In 11 Hen.

Neither by him nor by any later Sheriff do I find that such allowances were claimed. Leaving now these general statistics, I should say something more particular of the Fermors or other participators in the revenues of this Manor of Claverley. Passing the grant to Robert de Girros, which was a grant in fee, and not in fee-farm, the Sheriff of the County was the usual Fermor of Claverley, from the accession of Henry II to the death of Henry III. Towards the close of 1204, the marriage of Llewellyn with the daughter of King John resulted in a temporary pacification between England and Wales. Not only did Llewellyn become Lord of the Royal Manor of Ellesmere, but some of his more influential sub jects shared in the Royal bounty. On March 23, 1205, King John, being at Worcester, issued a writ to the Sheriff of Shropshire, commanding him to provide, \"in one of the Royal Manors without Bruges,\" 10 merks of land, wherever best situated, which the King had given to Madoc, son of Griffin.1- Grantee, thus favoured, was Madoc ap Gruffyth Maylor, Lord of Bromfield and Powis Vadoc ; and the King's bounty took effect, in \"part at least, within the Manor of Claverley. Lands therein to the value of \u00a35. Is. were assigned to Madoc, and he continued to hold those lands till the summer of 1210. Hence the Sheriff of Shropshire, in his account of the Ferm of the.County at Michaelmas 1207, discharges himself of a sum of \u00a313. 17s. 9d. given to \"Madoc sou of Griffin, in Claverlei.\" This was equivalent to 2f years' revenue of land, yielding \u00a35. Is. per annum. In 1209, two more years' revenue (\u00a310. 2s.) had been received by Madoc, and were claimed in abate ment of his own debts by the Sheriff. It further appears, from the Pipe Roll of 14 John, that Madoc held this land till June 1210, the Sheriff discharging himself of \u00a33. 15s. 9d. for three parts of the rent of that fiscal year. We cannot determine the precise way in which this grant ceased. Though Llewellyn rebelled against his Father-in-Law, Madoc con tinued in the King's allegiance ; and two years after the expiration of this grant, viz., on August 3, 1212, King John is found urging the Earl of Chester to protect Madoc ap Griffin, whose conduct is contrasted with that of Llewellyn, and whose relationship to himself the King chooses to describe as that of \" a beloved son,\"13 a term, it would seem, employed to show the Earl how utterly the King repudiated Llewellyn's claim to any such title. Claus, I, 23. | 13 Claus, I, 121."], [95, "71 CLAVERLEY. Again, therefore, the Sheriff of the County became sole Fermor of the King's demesne at Claverley. And this continued till the year 1229, when Henry III granted the Manor in fee-farm to John Fitz Philip, \u2014 to hold for life, paying \u00a315. yearly at the Exchequer, by even half-yearly payments at Easter and Michael mas, the King however reserving all Tallages and aids arising to himself from the said Manor.14 John, son of Philip Helgot, the Grantee here named, was Lord of Bobbington, Quat, Kinver, and Barlaston. He was sometimes styled of Kinfare, sometimes of Bobbington, and under the latter Manor we will speak of him and his family more generally. At Michaelmas 1230, he rendered his first account of \u00a315. for a year's fee-farm rent of Claverley, which he had paid into the Treasury (not to the Sheriff) \" and was quit.\" It is very remarkable, that though the Sheriff hereby lost not only his profits as Fermor of Claverley, but all receipts whatever from the Manor, he was not therefore allowed to strike off a farthing from the balance due from him as Fermor of the County. Nominally he continued to receive and to pay into the Exchequer whatever part of the County ferm was apportioned on Claverley. This fiction of finance may be thus explained :-\u2014 It was a standing principle of the Exchequer, that though the Ferm of a County might be increased, it was never to be diminished. The increase was not usually effected by altering that leading item in the Sheriff's annual account, called the Corpus Comitatus, but by inserting on the Pipe Roll a second and constantly in creasing item of account which I have already alluded to under the name of Proficuum Comitatus?'* The case before us was an exception to this rule ; for though the King, in 1230, increased his receipts from Shropshire by \u00a315., that increase is not stated in the Proficuam Comitatus, to which it really belonged : \u2014 for it was all one if the Sheriff, receiving \u00a315. less than formerly, continued to pay the old ferm, as if, receiving the same, he had been charged \u00a315. more for supposed profits. John Fitz Philip continued, more or less regularly, to account for his annual ferm of Claverley. In 1234, the King excused him \u00a37. 10s. of the same. He died in 1238, aud the Sheriff became again Fermor of Claverley, but not in the same way as before, for he contiuued to be charged with the fee-farm rent of \u00a315. as well 14 Rot. Cart. 13 Hen. Ill, m. 13. | 1S Supra, p. 64, note 4."], [96, "72 CLAVERLEY. as with whatever he constructively paid in the Corpus Comitatus. The change of Fermors, which must have taken place in 1238-9, is not marked on the Pipe Roll till 1241, when the Sheriff is said to account for \" \u00a315. of the issues of Claverley, which is in the King's hand.\" Nor do the Pipe Rolls down to 1272, however much I may suspect their accuracy, enable me to mark any change in this arrangement. The Roll of 1269 charges seven years' ferm on several Sheriffs, and the whole seems to be still due in 1272 ; but there is a confusion on the subject, either arising from a lax method of keeping these accounts, or from the nature of the case, which inclines me to listen to other evidence. \u2014 John, son of John Fitz Philip, often called John Fitz Philip, Junior, was a Minor at his Father's decease in 1238, but came of age in or about 1250. Though the Father's fee-farm grant of Claverley was only for life, and though I find no renewal thereof to the Son, it seems clear that the latter for a time held the Manor. The resident Jurors, who in 1255 reported on the state of Claverley, say as follows ; \u2014 \" John Fitz Philip holds the Manor of Claverlag', by what warrant the Jurors know not, and the Manor yields in rents \u00a313. 5s. per annum ; and the said John pays for the same yearly, in gross for the Manor and its issues, \u00a315. to the Lord the King, saving to the Lord the King his right of Tallage.\" And the Jurors of Brug distinctly confirm this statement, saying that the Manor of Claverleg is of \u00a315. annual value ; that John Fitz Philip holds it by unknown warrant ; and that the King has the Tallage?6 How or when John Fitz Philip, Junior, lost the ferm of Claverley I can only conjecture. In 1267, he was under forfeiture, and his lands had been intrusted to Prince Edward ; but he was pardoned at instigation of the Queen, and his land restored by consent of the Prince.17 I suppose him to have been implicated in the Treason of Montfort. In 1274, the Jurors for Claverley declared the Manor to be \"antient demesne of the Crown,\" and that it was then in the King's hand. The latter fact was repeated by the Jurors of Brug.18 Sometime between this period (1274) and 1292, the King, by Letters Patent, committed the Manor of Claverley, during pleasure, to Roger Careles and Nicholas de Warrewyk, at a rent of \u00a316. per 16 Rot. Bund. II, 61, 59. I is Sot Sundred n go, 88. -' Patent, 51 Hen. III."], [97, "73 CLAVERLEY. annum. The Claverley Jurors of 1292 reported these joint Fermors as then holding the Manor.19 A year later and Roger Careles would seem to be sole Fermor ; for on Nov. 26, 1293, the King orders his Justice of the Forest to inquire, by oath, of the Foresters and Verderers of Morse and Kynefare, if it would injure the Crown to grant to \" Roger de Carle, who holds the Manor of Claverle at ferm,\" license to assart and enclose (so as not to prevent ingress of the King's wild animals) 30 acres of waste, \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs ?30 The Jury, which replied to this inquiry, found that the grant might be made without hurt in the direction of Shipley, Wytymere, Draycot Hetthon (Heathton), and Bobington, and in other specified localities. They estimated the land as worth 5s. annually to the King, viz., 2d. per acre. I do not find any grant of this Manor in fee-farm till 5 Edw. II (1311-12), when Ingelard de Warle was to hold it in that mode for ten years, at the usual rent. This term had long to run, when in 7 Edw. II (1313-14) I find the Manor granted, with several others, to Richard de Arundell, who was to hold the same for life, for his maintenance in the King's service. His intended salary from this and other sources was to be as much as \u00a380. per annum. In the following year (8 Edw. II) the Manor was reseized by the King in consequence of the death of the last Grantee.21 In 1316, the Feodary of Brimstree Hundred enters the King as Lord of Claverley, it being, I suppose, still in hand?2 In 13 Edw. II (1319-20) Custody of Claverley was granted to John Knokyn, during the King's pleasure, at a fee-farm rent of \u00a316. per annum. In 18 Edw. II (1324-5) a similar grant, in reward of good ser vices, was made to Margery de Polford, with whom I close this account of the early Fermors of Claverley.23 A word now on the constitution and powers of those Manorial Courts which, as in the case of Claverley, may be said to have governed the demesne estates of the Crown. Most of these Courts had peculiar customs regulated by prescription ; they had other features in common. A Manor of ancient demesne was extra hundredal; it was as it were a Hundred in itself, owing no suit to 19 Placita Coronas, 20 Edw. I, m. 39. 20 Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I, No. 54. 21 Originalia, I, 184, 203, 214. 22 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 399. 23 Originalia, I, 250, 287. iii. 10"], [98, "74 CLAVERLEY. nor having any concern in other Hundred-Courts, but, like the latter, controlled by the County Court, and responsible to the King's Justiciars in many matters, but chiefly in those which were connected with criminal law, and came under the class called \" Pleas of the Crown.\" A Manor of Ancient demesne sometimes had the Suit of neighbouring Manors not of demesne, and which in that case owed no Suit to any Hundred Court. Thus it was with Claverley. The Bailiff and Tenants of a Crown Manor were analogous, in their corporate functions, to the Bailiff and Freeholders of a Hun dred, or to the Provosts and Burgesses of a Borough. Where Court- Rolls of a Manor are lost, the Record of nearly all civil proceedings relating to that Manor is lost also. So also are lost all memoranda of those minor offences which the special privi leges of a Manor might enable it to judge of and to punish. But in graver matters of criminal law it was otherwise. Whenever the King's Justices visited Shropshire, the Manors of ancient demesne were obliged to appear, before them by their representatives. The Juries, thus formed, gave account, \u2014 each Jury of the transactions within its own Manor, since the last Iter of the Justices. They reported all such graver offences, as being beyond their own cogni zance, had yet been committed within their Liberties, and how the same had been dealt with by the County Court. They also answered various questions which the Justiciars were generally accustomed, or had particular directions, to ask. We will now follow, through the Assize-Rolls, these early reports of the Community of Claverley. The first regular Iter in Shropshire, of which we have detailed Record, was held in the Autumn of 1203. Claverley seems to have been adequately represented, but either its Jurors had nothing to report, or nothing was judged necessary to be recorded on the Roll. At the Assizes of November 1221, the Town (Villata) of Claverleg appeared in the persons of a Provost and six Jurors. They reported three murders which had taken place in their Manor, naming the Murderers, the victims, and the parties by whose suit or prosecution, sentence of outlawry had passed against the accused ; 24 also that the latter had no chattels, a matter always inquired of, as involving the rights of the Crown. 24 Outlawry could only be pronounced by the County Court. The accused must be summoned five times, and fail to ap pear, before sentence could issue."], [99, "75 CLAVERLEY. They represented a complaint made by the \" King's men of Claverleg,\" viz. that John Fitz Philip and Simon de Tresel en grossed to themselves pasture and wood -land of the King, which belonged to the King's Manor of Claverleg, and that they wished to attach the premises to other fees. The Justiciars hereupon ordered the Sheriff to make inquisition on the matter by twelve laivful- Knights. They further presented the value and incumbency of Claverley Church, of which I have already spoken.25 The Inquisitions of 1255, though not taken at any Assizes, were taken by Justiciars. Claverley was, on this occasion, represented by a Jury of twelve. Several items of their report belong to par ticular members of the Manor, and shall be given below. They stated, in answer to a question as to any rights of the King having been interfered with, that Thomas, Lord of Tresel, had taken from the King forty acres of heath which used to belong to the Manor of Claverley. They admitted, or rather mentioned, the obligation which the men of Claverley were under to do Suit to the County Court. They showed that Shipley (originally an independent Manor) owed Suit to Claverley. They reported various purpres tures on the King's land, and the rents or fines chargeable for the same.26 At the Assizes of January 1256, Claverley was represented by its Bailiff, John de Dayncote, and a Jury of twelve, not one of whom, I observe, had sat on the Inquest of 1255. Their report was in the usual routine as to graver crimes committed in the Manor. It was also found that of their community John Fitz Philip, William de Mortimer (of Shipley), and Peter de Rivallis (Dean of Brug, and so Rector of Claverley), were not duly attending the Assizes. Mention is further made on the Record of an amerce ment \"for many transgressions,\" which had been imposed on a Claverley Jury, of which William de Hethton was Foreman.27 The next County Assizes were in September 1272, when William de Clotteuhale, Bailiff, and twelve Jurors of Claverley, attended. \u2014 They reported how the suit of Rudge and Shipley, which was gular, but not directly alluded to in the Record. I imagine however that the amerced Jury was the one which should ordinarily have appeared, but that, owing to its delinquencies, it was disqualified from acting. 26 Vol. I, p. 329. 36 Rot. Bundred, II, 61, 62. -1 Placita Coron\u00e6, 40 Hen. Ill, m. 4 dorso, 12 dorso. The Jury, on this oc casion, evidently consisted of strangers, not holding in Claverley.

They further brought forward Reginald de la Pette and Walter Geri, as under arrest for murder of John de Gatacre. The King's Justices had now to deal with the last matter, which they did by reference to a Jury of twenty-four, half of whom were of the Hundred (Brimstree, I suppose), and half of the Manor. The accused were acquitted.28 At the Inquisitions of 1274, three at least of the twelve Claverley Jurors were identical with Jurors of 1272. They repeated the pre sentment as to the withdrawal of Shipley and Rudge from suit of the King's greater Courts, held twice a year at Claverley; whence, it appears, the King lost certain penalties for blodivite, assize of beer, and other transgressions. They also alleged instances of extor tionate conduct on the part of the Sheriffs of the County or their Officers ; for instance, John Baril, when Under-Sheriff, had amerced the vills of Aston and Hetton (Heathton) in the sum of 40s., charging them with some liability in connection with the case of Roger de Braycote (Draycote probably) and Stephen Balle, who had been accused of a murder ; whereas the aforesaid vills had been exonerated before the Justiciars last in eyre, at Salop. Also Thomas Saule and Roger Clerk of Plesse (Plash), Receiver of Sir Hugh de Mortimer (Sheriff), took 22s. from Claverley Manor, as the value of the chattels of Hereward de Hetton (a Felon, I suppose, for whose chattels the Manor was accountable), and had given them (the men of Claverley) no acquittance, for that the Sheriff was still making distraint (for the debt).29 At the Assizes of October 1292, Claverley appeared by its Bailiff and twelve Jurors. The former officer, Richard de Claverlegh, was found to be in misericordid by the Justiciars, for contempt of Court, and other offences. The Jury reported a case of rape wherein the Prosecutrix, having lodged her appeal in the County Court, now failed to appear against William de Rudge, the Defendant. The Justiciars hereupon de clared the Prosecutrix and her Sureties to be in misericordid. The Defendant appeared, but because the matter touched the \" King's 28 Placita Coron\u00e6, 56 Hen. Ill, mem- 1 branes 21, 23. *> Rot Bundred, II, 91."], [101, "77 BROUGHTON. Peace,\" he must take his trial by Jury. He was tried and acquitted. The Jurors further presented the state of Claverley Church, which they valued at 60 merks per annum.30 They also showed how Roger de Mortimer had some time back appropriated lands of the King, and how William Lord of Rudge still held the same, and felled timber thereon. Hereupon Hugh de Louther, the Crown prosecutor, intimated to the Court that the King's Writ had issued in this matter, against the Lord of Rudge ; and so no further step was now taken therein. Lastly, the Jurors presented the old grievances of purpresture committed by the Lord of Tresel, and the withdrawal of the Suits of Shipley and Rudge from the King's Court at Claverley to Edmund de Mortimer's Court of Cleobury.31 I shall have more to say of these matters under the particular places which were concerned. John de Tresel's affair, after an adjournment to Lichfield on the 27th of January 1293, was ordered, in deference to a petition of the said John, tb be settled by Peram bulation. The King's Writ, dated Dec. 24, 1293, enjoins Master Adam de Crokedayk and Malcolumb de Harley to go with forty-eight Knights of the Counties of Worcester, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Salop, and ascertain the boundaries between Tresel and Claverley. This was done on Sunday, Oct. 3, 1294. The limits indicated \"are the top of Rudge (summitas de Rugge), \u2014 Wyte mores-wey, \u2014 Aston, \u2014 Seysdon-wey, \u2014 continuously over the Rugge, \u2014 Shipley-fields, \u2014 and the high-road towards Wolverhampton.\" 33 I must now notice in detail those numerous Townships and estates which constituted the great Manor of which I have thus far spoken collectively. Of the Townships of Claverley, three require primary notice, in regard that the King's Tenants thereof were of a rank superior to that of the average class of Freeholders in Royal Manors. These Townships were Broughton, Beobridge, and Gatacre. And first of \u2014 BROUGHTON, which I have already shown to have been the only part of his Manor of Claverley which Henry II granted in fee to a subject. This was in the year 1155, and the Feoffee was Robert de Giros, of whom I have already spoken more than once. The Sheriffs of Shropshire, from 1156 to 1190 inclusive, discharged themselves of 35s. \" Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I, No. 58. 30 Compare Vol. I, p. 337. 31 Placita Coron\u00e6, 20 Edw. I, Salop."], [102, "78 CLAVERLEY. annually, in respect of 35 solidates of Royal Demesne, granted in Claverley to Robert de Giros. All that I can say of Robert de Giros' dealings with this estate is, that he appears to have founded and endowed a chapel thereon, charging such endowment (3s. per annum) on the gross receipts. At Michaelmas 1191, the said Robert de Giros having deceased, his presumed son or grandson, another Robert, seems to have been a Minor and a Ward of the Crown. His estate at Broughton was thus dealt with.\u2014 The Sheriff deducts 35s. as usual from the ferm of the County in respect of land in Claverley which had been Robert de Giros' ; but whereas he, the Sheriff, now received the income as an escheat, he acknowledges his obligation to give a distinct account thereof. Accordingly, lower down on the Roll, he gives the same thus \u2014 \" The Sheriff renders account of 35s. of the land of Claverlay which was Robert de Giros'. Into the Treasury he has paid 32s. : And for the Chapel of Burton 3s. of the gift of the same Robert. And he (the Sheriff) is quit.\" In similar or equivalent terms, the Sheriff or the Escheator continues to account for the proceeds of \" Burgton \" till the half year ending March 1195, about which time as I have already suggested the heir had livery. And from 1195 to 1273 (the whole time for which I profess to give continuous extracts from the Pipe Rolls) the Sheriff discharges his Ferm of a sum of 35s. annually for \"land given in Claverley to Robert de Giros.\" This however was a technical mode of stating the matter, and only meant that the said land, being, to the extent of 35s. a constituent of the County Ferm, brought nothing to the Sheriff, but was lawfully bestowed elsewhere. As to Robert de Giros' continuous interest therein, that was no concern of the Barons of the Exchequer, who only cared that the Sheriff's charges should be duly authorized, not who profited thereby. When I state or rather repeat that Robert de Giros, the last male heir of his line, was deceased in 1251, leaving the issue of his Sisters his heirs, I am merely prefacing a further fact, viz. that however continuously Robert de Giros' name may appear on the Pipe Rolls as Lord of Broughton, Broughton was perhaps that one of his estates which he first alienated. Proof of this will involve the further history of this Township. \u2014 Isabel, one of the before-named Sisters of Robert de Giros, was married early in the thirteenth Century to Thomas de Constantine."], [103, "79 BROUGHTON. Robert de Girros gave them Broughton in frank-marriage ; but at the time of the gift there was some doubt as to its efficacy, for Broughton was held by certain services, which services not having been duly performed, Robert de Giros' own title was in jeopardy. At all events the Grantees did not obtain immediate or unbought possession. Hence the following Fine proffered to the Crown about September 1207.\u2014 \"Thomas de Costetin and Ysabel his wife give five merks for having their land in Burton, which Robert de Girros, Brother of the said Ysabel, gave in marriage with the said Ysabel to the same Thomas, and which had beeu seized into the King's hand by the Sheriff in respect of default in the service which the same Robert owed the King for the aforesaid tenement, and whereof the same Robert, as he declares, hath since had seizin by the Justiciar\" (that is, by writ of Geoffrey Fitz Piers, Chief- Justice of England). Hereupon mandate issued to Thomas de Erdington, \" Sheriff of Staffordshire \" (and Shropshire) to take security for payment of the said five merks, and then to give full and immediate seizin to the parties.33 The service by which Robert de Giros held Broughton next appears, as also that he remained chargeable therewith after his alienation of the land. Two Tenure Rolls of about the year 1211 thus speak of the matter. One says that \" Robert de Giras holds Bureton, a member of Claverleg, of the gift of King Henry, father of King John, by service of finding one serving foot-soldier in the army of Wales, which (land) is wont to pay 32s.\" 3i The other Roll says that \" Robert de Giros holds 35 solidates of land in Burgton, a member of Claverle, by serjeantry of a foot soldier in Wales.\" 35 I have never seen further evidence of Thomas de Constantine's Tenure of Broughton, either under his Brother-in-law or more independently. I cannot think that it endured, and in fact the alienation of a Serjeantry was a matter of doubtful legality, and, unless done by special license, was always liable to be questioned. Certain it is that before the year 1235, Robert de Giros again dealt with Broughton as if the fee-simple were still his own. This second alienation was a gift of the estate to Haughmond Abbey, 33 Fines, 9 John, p. 397. Rot.

Robert de Giros' grant of \" his whole land of Borchtune\" includes \" the men holding the same and all their suit and service,\" from which I conclude that he had at the time no Tenants there except in villanage. It was tested by John Le Strange (the second, I suppose), John and Hamo, his sons, and Vivian de Rosehalle.36 In 1255, the Jurors of Claverley, enumerating the religious bodies and others who had lands within that Royal Manor, men tioned the Abbot of Hawemon as holding one and a half virgates in Burchton by service of doing suit to the Manor Court of Claverley thrice in a year. At the same time the Dean of Brug's estate at Wittimere is mentioned in conjunction with something he had in Broughton. \u2014 Robert de Burton, who was one of the Jury, was, I suppose, the Abbot of Haughmond's Tenant here.37 William and Robert de Burton in 1272, Richard de Borouton in 1274, and Robert son of Thomas de Burghton in 1292, appear upon different Claverley Juries, and were similarly, as I suppose, Tenants of the Abbey. It is, I think, probable that John Fitz Philip, of Bobbington, acquired some rights in Broughton under the Abbot of Haughmond. I cannot otherwise account for the fact that in the fourteenth cen tury, Sir Robert Corbet of Hadley had a prominent interest here. His relation to John Fitz Philip I shall speak of under Quat. Now I will cite the Deed, which shows him not only leasing land in Broughton, but holding a Manorial Court there. As Robert Corbet of Haddeleye, Chivaler, he grants to Sir Richard, son of Thomas atte Grene de Aston, a Clerk, all his lands and tenements, those, namely, which Roger Uppyntoun of Burghton, his native, held of him in villanage in the vill of Burghton : \u2014 rendering a rent of 4s. 2d., a heriot when due, and two appearances at the Grantor's Court of Burghton. He also grants the said native, his goods, chattels, and suit (family) . Wit nesses \u2014 Thomas atte Grene de Aston, Richard atte Grene de Claverleye, Osbert de Burghton, &c.

Is. 4d. per annum, appear among the former possessions of his House.40 Broughton Chapel.\u2014 Tradition is quoted by more than one authority41 as pointing to the sometime existence of a Chapel here. The Legend has been confirmed above, by evidence showing that Robert de Giros founded and endowed the same in the twelfth Century. Of course, Broughton Chapel was from the first only an affiliation of Claverley Church. Thus probably the interest which the Dean of Brug is said in 1255 to have had in Broughton, consisted in the Chapel and some lands attached thereto, which were his as Rector of Claverley. The same Record, describing the status of the Church of Claverle, names Burhton and Bobiton as its members, i.e., subject Chapels.42 BEOBRIDGE. This member of Claverley adjoins Broughton, but was granted to a subject much earlier; \u2014 in fact either by one of the Norman Earls or by Henry I. The Grantee will have been one of the successors of Roger Venator, the Domesday Tenant of a Fief or Barony known afterwards as the Honour of Pulverbatch, that Manor being its caput. It is possible that Roger Venator was himself the original Grantee, and held this member of Claverley as early as Domesday . The silence of that Record on the point does not amount to a conclusive negative, while Roger Venator's attestation of Earl Roger's charter to Quatford College would be consistent with a supposed personal and local interest in the matter. In the time of Henry II the Barony of Roger Venator was in an heir female, viz., Emma, daughter of Reginald de Pulverbatch. She was wife of Herbert de Castello, Lord of Holgate, but, both dying childless, these united Baronies were dissevered, and went to the collateral heirs of each party.

Her grant mentions that the pre mises are of her own \" fee or inheritance,\" though given with her husband's consent. Its date is determined as having been con firmed by King Henry II, not later than 1 086. Herbert de Castello also confirmed the gift subject to his own life, which, by the way, ended in 1190, his wife surviving him.44 Before Michaelmas 1193, Emma de Pulverbatch was also de ceased, and John de Kilpec, claiming to be her heir, had fined \u00a3100. for his relief for the \" Barony of Purbech.\"45 In course of time, John de Kilpec began to question the Abbot of Haughmond's rights at Beobridge, not that he disputed his possession of the land, but that he denied the grant to have been in frank-almoign, and therefore sued him for the knight's service proportioned thereto, viz., one-fifth of a Knight's fee. This suit, being a specimen of the class termed Placita Servitii, I will follow through its successive stages. \u2014 \"At Westminster, on the Quinzaine of the Holy Trinity, 1200, a day was given to the Abbot of Haghmon, and to John de Kilpec, plaintiff in a plea of service, viz., in three weeks of Michaelmas.

The Abbot appears, and pleads that he does not owe that service on the said tenement, and thereupon he puts himself on the King's Great Assize.\"47 An entry lower down on the Roll exhibits John de Kilpec de manding that Recognition be had in the matter, and the Justices ordering accordingly, viz. \u2014 \"that said John have a Writ to summon four Knights, who should choose twelve Knights who should cause said Recognition to be made on the arrival of the Justices\" (the Justices next in eyre are meant) . In October 1203 the County was visited by William de Cantilupe and his Associate Justices. Their proceedings are extant, and give a full account of this Suit. The four Knights \" summoned to choose twelve, to make recognition between the Abbot of Hagemon and John de Kilpec concerning the service which the Abbot owed in Bebrig, and to say whether the Abbot held by service of one fifth of a Knight's fee, as John de Kilpec required, or whether he should hold the tenement under said John in frank-almoiyn, as he, the Abbot, acknowledged himself to hold;\" \u2014 these four Knights, it appears, had attended to their duty. They were Roger de Begesour, Walter de Hugford, Warner de Wililey, and Robert de Gatacre. They had added to themselves Philip Fitz Holegot, Robert de Girros, Hugh de Sudburi, Roger Corbet, Richard de Ruiton, Simon de Perepunt, Hugh de Upton, William BotereU, Philip de Fernlawe (Farlow), Reiner de Lega (Lee), Warin de Burwardel, and Richard de Lecton (Leighton) . The whole sixteen Knights were ready to make recognition ; when it appeared that the parties had accorded, the Abbot being represented by Henry, a Canon of his house.48 All the Fines levied at this Iter are lost from the proper custody. The Haughmond Chartulary preserves however the one of which we are here in need. It purports to have been levied in the Curia Regis at Salop, on the octaves of Michaelmas, 5 John (1203), before William de Cantilupe &c.

In 1255, the Abbot of Hawemon's land in Bebrug is estimated at one hide, for which he did suit thrice a year to the Manorial Court of Claverley. He also held an acre and half oi purpresture in the Manor, for which he paid 4d. yearly to the King.61 The Haughmond Chartulary supplies many instances of the Abbot's later dealings with his Grange and Estate at Beobridge. Besides leases and surrenders, we have a detailed account of the manner in which several acres of waste in Morf Forest were allotted to the Abbot in 1304, for which he paid the King 6s. 8d. per acre on entry, and was to pay a further annual rent of 6d. per acre. The matter was settled at a Morf-Forest-Court, held at Bridgnorth, at which were present and assisting, a Deputy of the Custos of the said Forest, two Regarders, several Jurors, and two persons wiiose office was to rent out (arentare) the King's Wastes in the Forests citra Trent. The tract of land thus allotted to the Abbot was called Skyneresmore, and a marl-pit therein was specially reserved for the general use of the King's Tenants of Claverley. In 27 Henry VIII (1535-6) the Abbot of Haughmond returned his Manor of Bewbridge as realizing \u00a314. 7s. l\\d. annually, but this estimate probably included Broughton and other lands. He paid his Bailiff here 10s. per annum?2 \u2014 The Ministers' Accounts, six years later, give rents amounting to \u00a37. 17s. 5^d., as derived from Bewbridge (Upper and Lower) alone.53 Of Under-Tenants here I select the following names from local Juries, Testing -clauses, or lists of those who, at various times, are 49 Chartulary at Sundorn, so. 32. relation of Robert de Girros. 51 Rot.

On Oct. 17, 1316, Richard, son of the said Richard Petit, sells to Richard de la Broke of Claverley some small parcels of arable and pasture land in Bebrugg; and on Oct. 10, 1318, the same person sells a seylion of land there to Richard de la Broke, Clerk, son of Richard de la Broke of Claverley.54 Nash. \u2014 A tenement or land thus named was appurtenant to Beobridge.

Also Stephen atte Nassh appears Nov. 23, 1333, on a Jury appointed by the Manorial Court to decide a question of succession, which was in agitation at the time when the earliest existent Court- Rolls commence. Also in 1274, Richard Petit of Beobridge (above named), with John his son, become Lessees under the Abbey of four acres in the field of Nasse.55 Pole, or Polehouse, was another member of Beobridge, and I find Henry de la Pole and Richard at Pole (otherwise called Richard Carpenter de la Pole) attesting many deeds of the middle of the thirteenth century. The latter is, I doubt not, the person who, under the third designation of Richard de Burhton Carpenter, appears to have married Matilda, daughter of William de la Pole, and who, after his said wife's decease, has a grant from Alan Abbot of Haughmond (1272-1281) of land in Polehous juxta Bewbrugge, in tail to the heirs of the Grantee by his second wife, with remainder to heirs by his deceased wife.56 We have also a subsequent quit-claim to the Abbey by Richard de Borghton Carpenter of all lands held by him in Polehous.57 Beobridge Chapel. \u2014 Mr. Blakeway refers to the Haughmond Chartulary as establishing the existence of a Chapel here.

GATACRE. King Henry I is known to have constituted the Barony or Honour of Montgomery; \u2014 more probably with reference to his designs on Wales thau to make provision for Baldwin de Boilers, first Lord of the said Honour, who had married Sibil de Faleise, a Lady reputed to be nearly related to the King. The lands and fees annexed to this Barony were chiefly, but not entirely, selected from the Escheats of Earl Robert de Belesme. Among those Escheats was Claverley ; \u2014 and Gatacre, a member of Claverley, was made one of the appurtenances of the new Honour. The contemporary Lord of Montgomery was therefore, at all periods of which I propose to speak, seignoral Lord of Gatacre, holding mediately between the Crown and a family of knightly rank, which, having early feoffment in Gatacre, took its name from the place. The period of such feoffment it is vain to conjecture, as being beyond all Record of such matters. The Feoffor may have been one of the Norman Earls, or King Henry I, or an early Lord of Montgomery. The Feoffees held elsewhere in Shropshire under the Barony of Pulverbatch, a circumstance which points to no further conclusion as to their origin, though it happens to furnish us with an early event in their history. Of that however, presently. The first direct mention which I find of Gatacre is associated with the names of its Under-tenants rather than its owners. Thus, at Michaelmas 1160, the Sheriff of Shropshire is said to owe 21s. of the money (de pecunia) of William de Gatacre, an expression usually associated with some penalty or forfeiture levied on the goods of a person of poor estate, and far less than knightly degree. The Sheriff paid the debt in the following year.69 63 Ibidem, so. 32. The Lessee was also to be the Abbot's Bailiff, and collect his rents in Beobridge, Broughton, Alveley, Wichbold, and Brugge, and the sines and perquisites of his Court ; and the Abbot was to present him annually with a Robe, in return for such service. 58 Rot.

Some years afterwards the vill of Gathacra occupies a prominent position in the criminal annals of the period. \u2014 The famous Statutes of Northampton, the result of a Council held there in January 1 1 76, by Henry II, appointed that all graver crimes, such as murder, larceny, robbery, arson, and money-forgery, should first be sub mitted to the Verdict of a competent Jury, and that then those whom the Jury declared guilty should be further subjected to the Ordeal of Water. If the accused failed to go through the latter, that is, if he did not sink when plunged into deep water, he was judged definitely guilty, lost his right hand and one foot, aud was compelled to abjure the realm, and to leave it within forty days.60 The Justices appointed to the Shropshire Circuit under the Statutes in question were at Salop before Michaelmas of the same year (1176). Of thirty persons who failed to undergo the Ordeal at these Assizes, five were of the vill of Gathacra. Their Chattels, which, being forfeit to the Crown, the Sheriff afterwards accounted for at the Exchequer, varied in value from half a merk to 3s., which shows their estate to have been just above that of villanage?1 The [first notice which I find of any apparent Lord of Gatacre is of Sir William de Gatacre, for such doubtless was the name and rank of him who, described only as Father of Robert de Gatacre, is said in a later Record to have had a suit with one Walter about half a hide of land in Great Lye, which each claimed to hold of the Barony of Pulverbatch. This affair, which seems to belong to the time of Henry II or Richard I, was subject of a Wager of Battle in the Curia Comitatus, but was not thus settled. William de Gatacre was one of those four Visors who, in July 1194, had to report to the Courts of Westminster on the validity of the essoign of Cecilia de Cantreyn, a Litigant, whose cause I have already set forth.62 Gatacre's associates in this duty, to which Knights only were usually appointed, were Henry Christian, Philip Fitz Holegod, and William de Ruge (Rudge), all his neighbours, and of equal rank with himself. He was succeeded by Sir Robert de Gatacre, who occurs as a Knight, because on a Jury of Grand Assize which was appointed in April 1200 to try a question of right in relation to lands at Nordley Regis at the next Iter of the King's Justices.63 60 Eoveden, 313, b.

At' the County Assizes (October 1203) he appears in more than one capacity, viz., as a Knight and Juror of Grand Assize; as Surety for some one, whose non-appearance occasioned him an amerce ment of half a merk; lastly, as himself a Litigant. His suit, which appears to have been with William, son of that Walter who had been his Father's antagonist, was compounded, Gatacre giving the King half a merk for license to accord. His pledge for the said fine was William Fitz Walter, his opponent, \u2014 a very usual circum stance in Suits thus terminated.64 The Concord resulting from this affair is found to exist, though in a strange depository, \u2014 the Worn bridge Chartulary. Thereby William Fitz Walter concedes for himself and heirs to Robert de Gatacre and his heirs, all right in a moiety of Magna Lya (Great Lyth, near Shrewsbury) which his (Robert's) Father sought to obtain from the Grantor's Father by wager of battle (per finem duelli) in the County Court of Salopes buri, to wit, in half a hide of land, which the said Robert and his heirs should hold of the Barony of Pulrebech in chef: also, said William concedes certain nokes oi land which are of the Fee of Alberbury, which said Robert and heirs should hold of the Grantor and his heirs at an annual rent of 2s. hd.

Gatacre conceded the premises,\u2014 to hold to Robert and Matilda and the heirs of Matilda under Gatacre and his heirs by free service of 4s. per annum, as well as forinsec services.

In one instance he is followed by John, his Brother. In 1255, the Jurors of Claverley, under the head of \" Knights, Free Tenants, and Religious bodies, who held lands within the King's Manors,\" stated that Stephen de Gatacre held in Claverley Manor one hide, viz., in Gatacre and Sutton (printed Lucton), by service of doing suit at the three Courts of Claverley. To the question whether the Free-Tenants, Provost, and others, duly attended (the Inquest in hand, I suppose), they returned that Stephen de Gatacre did not so attend, because he was withheld by infirmity.67 At this period, John de Gatacre, whom I take to be the above mentioned brother of Stephen, had, as Guardian of an Heir, seizin of the small Manor of Coats, near Rushbury.68 Mention of his name in the matter of his Aunt's murder by Master Walter le Palmer has already been made.69 He was probably Appellant in the case ; but we may be attributing this office to a wrong person ; for \u2014 The successor to Stephen de Gatacre was another John de Gatacre, probably Son of Stephen. The Heraldic Pedigrees omit him altogether. He, John, is a principal witness of some undated deeds which passed between 1255 and 1272. In one instance he is expressly styled \" Lord of Gatacre.\" 70 He too, I take it, was that John de Gatacre whose death was subject of inquiry in 1272, as before stated. George de Cantilupe, who died in 1273, was Lord of the Honour of Montgomery, and so had the Seigneury of all the Knights' fees which then pertained to that Barony. One of the Inquests taken after his death seems to have made mention of the Manor of Gatacre as held of the said Barony, but the Tenant's name does not appear.71 The inheritance of George de Cantilupe was matter of much litigation.

In Easter Term 1280, she is impleading John de Gatacre, for a Knight's Fee in Gatacre, that is, not for the estate, but for the service due thereon.72 Here then is a second John, Lord of Gatacre. The next Lord of Gatacre, of whom I have certain note, was Geoffrey de Gatacre, who stands first witness of a Deed dated August 12, 1324, which shall be given presently.73 Geoffrey de Gatacre died on Sept. 5,74 1345. The events which followed are so authoritatively stated, and are so clear as to the tenures and estates of this family, that I must needs pursue the subject to a period later than my usual limits. Geoffrey was succeeded by his son and hen, Thomas, who entered upon the several estates of Gatacre, Sutton, and Great Lyth immediately on his Father's death, and held them till Nov. 10, 1367. On that day the King's Escheator, Philip de Lutley, held an Inquest at Bridgnorth as to these estates, and, in consequence of the finding of the Jury, seized them all into the King's hand. The reason was as follows : \u2014 The said Jury found that the hamlet of Sutton was a tenure in capite by Knight's service, and that on his late father's death, Thomas de Gatacre had entered upon Sutton, Gatacre, and Great Lyth, without doing homage and fealty to the Crown, and without paying his relief, so that he had occupied the same unjustly for twenty-two years and more. Very shortly after this Inquest and Disseizin, Thomas de Gatacre died ; but Alice, his Widow, claiming to have held Gatacre and Sutton conjointly with her late husband, moved at once a suit at law for their recovery. On June 5, 1368, she appeared personally in Chancery, and pleaded that Sutton was not held of the King in capite, but of William la Zouche of Haryngworth, and that Geoffrey de Gatacre and all Thomas de Gatacre's Ancestors had so held it under La Zouche and his Ancestors ; and that, as she was pre pared to prove all this, she prayed that the King would \" remove his hand.\" Here I should observe, that the tenure of Gatacre and Great Lyth did not come into question, the former being confessedly 1\" Abbreviatio Pladtorum, p. 198. brother and heir of Robert. The first assertion wants confirmation. The last is clearly an error. 73 A printed Pedigree calls Geoffrey son and heir of William de Gatacre, and William (said to occur in 1293 and 1313) 74 One Inquest says October 5."], [115, "GATACRE. 91 held under La Zouche, as heir of Cantilupe, while the latter is particularly mentioned in these proceedings as being held at the time under Edward le Botyler, by service of 2s. rent. Alice's Plea in Chancery was resisted by the Crown Prosecutor, with the simple reassertion, that Sutton was held in capite; and both parties appealed to trial by Jury. Accordingly, the Sheriff of Shropshire was ordered to empanel twenty-four Knights and others, of the visnage of Sutton, not being of kin to Alice, to try the issue. Return was to be made before the King in Chancery in Michaelmas Term, 1368. Meanwhile, the King issued a Writ to Philip de Lutley, or dering him to certify why he had seized the Manor of Gatacre. Lutley's answer quotes the Bridgnorth Inquisition, and justifies the seizure on the well-known ground, that all estates of a Tenant in capite were involved in the liabilities accruing on the particular estate so held, which in this instance was Sutton. Again on August 25, 1368, a Writ of King Edward III rebukes Lutley for not having given account of his seizure of Great Lyth, \" as he had been repeatedly ordered to do.\" He is enjoined either to do so at once by letter, or appear in Chancery on September 15 following. Lutley's reply excuses his previous omission on the ground that the King's former Writ only ordered him to account for the seizure of Gatacre aud Sutton, and to that he had already made return in Chancery. He now states that the lands, tenements, and rents which he had seized in Great Lyth were worth 40s. per annum, and that his grounds for this seizure were identical with the grounds of his seizure of Gatacre, viz., that Sutton was a Tenure in capite, as found by the Bridgnorth Inquest.75 I cannot discover the further process of these inquiries, nor any Record of the proposed trial by twenty-four Jurors ; but it is evident that the result was in favour of Alice de Gatacre, for a King's Writ of the same year (1368) commits to the said Alice, widow of Thomas de Gatacre, custody of the Manor of Gatacre and the hamlet of Sutton, with their appurtenances.76 \u2014 We therefore conclude that Sutton was found to be held, like Gatacre, of La Zouche, and that the Gatacres were in no way liable as Tenants in capite. 75 The whole of these particulars are taken from two Records, numbered in the Calendar of Inquisitions as 19 Edw.

Thomas de Gatacre seems to have been eventually succeeded by his son, another Thomas, who occurs as a Knight in 1392.'7 Besides the Lords of Gatacre there were several families bear ing the name, either as Cadets of the principal branch, or from some other connection with the place. Thus I find a Reginald de Gatacre in 1224, Bertram de Gatacre a Juror in 1272, Walter de Gatacre occurring in Claverley affairs in 1304-5-6, and attesting Dudmaston Deeds in 1322 and 1326. A Thomas de Gatacre occurs on the earliest Court-Rolls of 1333 and 1334; and in the latter year, \"Bertram, son of Reginald de Gatacre, came into Court and surrendered into the hands of the Lord (of Claverley) a parcel of meadow for the use and behoof of Osbert, son of Osbert de Boroughton, Edith his wife, and their heirs. Osbert and Edith had ingress, paying a fine of 8d. to the Lord, and doing fealty.\" This I give as an instance of the pro ceedings of these Manorial Courts, but now return to Gatacre and its Under-tenants. \u2014 There was a John Wygod of Gatacre, a Juror of Claverley in 1255, and a witness of local deeds before and after. There was also a William de Gatacre, styled sometimes \"William the Serjeant of Gatacre,\" of whom I should say a little. Besides being a witness of local deeds, he had apparently, about the year 1260, from Adam, son of Alan de Eston (Aston), a grant of three acres of land in Aston, to hold to him and his heirs at a penny rent, and for 9s. paid on ingress.78 This William, or his son of the same name, sat on the Manorial Inquest of 1274 ; and the son had, somewhat later, a grant in Aston from Richard son of Adam le Fremon of Aston (that is, son of his Father's Feoffor), wherein he is styled \"William son of WiUiam le Serjaunt de Gatacre.\" The service on this last grant was to be included in the penny rent already stipulated, but the Grantee paid a further fine of 6s.

On Nov. 18, 1221, Alan de Eston essoigns himself, through Reginald de Lega (Lee), in a suit of land which he had at West minster against Nicholas de Wundewell (Woundall) .82 The son of this Alan was Adam, alias Adam le Fremon de Aston, second Juror on the Inquisition of 1255, first Juror at the Assizes of 1272, and sixth Juror on the Inquisition of 1274. His grant to William le Serjeant of Gatacre has been already cited, as also those of his son Richard to the son and grandson of the said William. This Richard le Fremon was second Juror at the Assizes of 1292, and was living in 1328. A second Adam le Fremon occurs in 1343. At this time there was a William de Aston (called in one instance Dominus) making extensive purchases in Claverley, particularly from Sir William de Shareshull, Knight, who had for life a fee farm grant of the Manor, and whose deeds of feoffment reserve rents, first payable to himself, and afterwards to the King.83 I have no space to enter into further details than to say that this William de Aston left issue, William and Richard, the former of whom, in 1349, enfeoffed the latter by fine levied at Westminster, in a large estate (one carucate &c.) at Claverley and Gatacre, for which the Feoffee is said to pay 100 merks tation of the King's wastes in Shropshire.

For this 29s. was paid on Ingress?* This William de Cymiterio was doubtless he who, as William de Aston, sat third Juror at the Claverley Inquisition of 1255, which I think he survived not long. He left two sons, Adam and Stephen, the first of whom was in possession within the next ten years; \u2014 for when, by a deed apparently of that date (1255-65), Alexander fitz Richard de Porta, the former Grantee, transfers his feoffment to Walter de Borchtun, he mentions Adam fitz William de Cymiterio as the adjoining landholder, and as now entitled to the reserved rent of 2s.85 Alexander received 30s. for the transfer, which Adam fitz William de Cimiterio, by a third deed, confirmed.88 I think that this Adam fitz William died shortly afterwards, leaving a widow, Alice, but no issue, so that his Brother Stephen became his heir. The latter, styling himself \" Stephen son of William de Cymyterio de Aston,\" grants \" to Richard de Claverley, Chaplain, all his land within and without the vill of Aston, with all right and claim which he had there by reason of said land, which land is called the land of the Cymetery ;\" \u2014 to hold in fee, as the Grantor and his Father Wilbam had held it, together with the dower, whenever accruing, which Alice, daughter, of William de Burchton, had therein, and all rents, heriots i therefore yearly to the King of Manor of Claverleg, 5s. at four and his heirs one penny at Chris &c. thereto belonging; \u2014 rendering ' England, or his Attorney in the stated periods, and to the Grantor Christmas.

Richard, son of Adam le Granger of Aston, above mentioned as exchanging in 1331, was deceased in November 1333. His son Roger's claim to be his heir is the subject of several entries on the earliest of the Manorial Court-Rolls. \u2014 At the Court of November 2, 1333, he fines ISd. with the Lord (of the Manor) to haye judgment of the whole Court on an issue as to his Father's seizin when he died, and his own heirship ; in fact, the issue is embodied in a form very similar to that in which a suit of mort d'ancestre would have been propounded in the Curia Regis. The Inquisition made thereupon by the whole Court did not agree, except as to a part of the lands claimed, which part was adjudged to the Claimant, who named an Attorney to prosecute his suit at the next Court, as regarded the remainder. At the Court of November 23, 1333, there was ordered to be an Inquest as to the Heriot due to the Lord on Richard le Granger's death : also, Roger le Granger's Attorney had seizin of the land already adjudged to him, paying l\\d. relief.

John Fitz Philip is to have the goods at the same price as they had been valued at for the King ; he is also to have the land of said Nicholas, which land and chattels the King hath conceded to said John in custody, till other orders be given.95 Chyknell. \u2014 Robert de Chekenhull was assessed in 1209 for imbladement within regard of Morf Forest. In September 1224, the King's Justices, being at Shrewsbury, amerced Robert de Chikenehull and Cecilia his Mother half a merk for not prosecuting some suit, the Sureties for their so doing being William de Eston and Reginald de Gatacre.

At the Assizes of November 1221, Robert de Pictavia, a Clerk, was found to have disseized Katherine Fitz Henry of her free tenement in Luddesduu. Richard de la Pole was his Surety. The contemporary Dean of Brug I have already shown to have been a Poitevin.96 The Litigant in this case was doubtless his relation. The Inquest of 1255 reported that Peter de Rivallis (he was then Deali) held in Claverley Manor half a hide in Luddesdon, wherein the King was used to have all amercements arising under the assize of beer, and this right had been withdrawn (from the Manor Court) five years since. \" The Township pertained to the Church of Claverleg,\" i. e., to the Deanery. The same Dean's Tenants at Luddesdone had, also five years since, withdrawn the suit, which, in common with other Tenants in Claverley, they owed to the County Court.97 John le Fremon, or le Franchoume, of Luddesdon, and his apparent successor, Elias, occurring so often in undated deeds of the thirteenth century, were, I suppose, Tenants of the Dean. Roger Archer of Luddesdon was assessed in 1262, under regard of Morf Forest. Besides the above vills, now recognized as townships of Claverley, 1 should take brief notice of a few hamlets and families otherwise associated with the Manor. \u2014 Draycott. \u2014 Of this place we have Peter de Draicote, about 1250. John de Dayncote appeared as Chief Bailiff of Claverley at the Assizes of 1256. Roger and Bertram de Draycot occur later in the Century. The earliest Court-Roll (1333-4) mentions Richard de Draycote Senior, apparently deceased, and his son of the same name. Gravenor. \u2014 The first mention of this place and the family named therefrom is implied by the attestations of Roger de Gravenor, in the thirteenth Century. William de Gravenor occurs in 1324 and 1331. In 1333, this William essoigns his attendance at the Manor-Court, and is mentioned in other relations. Thomas, son of Richard Gravenore, and Richard, heir of Agnes de Gravenor, occur contemporarily, the latter taking from the Lord of the Manor a tenement &c. at the Lee (now Lea Farm) till such time as the right heir of said tenement should be forthcoming.98 96 Supra, Vol. I, p. 329. 9S Court Rolls of Claverley. \u00bb Rot.

Elyas de Claverley, who in the year 1200 fined two merks with the Crown that he might have his Bailiwick, was, I think, Father of Elyas de Bulewardin who in 1228 fines one merk for having the Bailiwick of the Bosc oi Claverley, viz., a moiety of the said Baili wick, as his Father had it.99 Frequently, about the middle of the same Century, we have Elyas de Bulwardine as a witness of local deeds. In 1262 the list entitled Essonia Mortis (which I have supposed to be a list of persons deceased) includes the name of Henry Forester of Morf as non-attendant at the Forest Assizes ; but the same list presents the name of Henry Fitz Elyas as Essoignor of Roger Gerbod,100 whom we know to have been Forester of that moiety of Morf which lay about Worfield. My impression is, that both these Foresters, Henry and Roger, were deceased at the time, and that either Henry Fitz Elyas was not identical with Henry the Forester, or else that there is some confusion in the Record. During the ngxt forty years we have the names, first of William de Bulwardine, and then of Hugh de Bulwardine, but only as wit nesses of local deeds. From 1300 to 1342, the name of Wilbam de Bulwardine is continuously occurring on local Juries, or as a witness of dated deeds, but I find no evidence that the family continued at this time to be Foresters of Morf. Wystanesmere has ceased to exist as a vill or township, but is of frequent mention in early Records. Its former situation is probably to be traced in two fields now called \" Whistimore,\" which are near Farmcott, and in the township of Claverley. Of the family which took name from this place we have Richard de Wystanesmere, a witness in the middle of the thirteenth century, and Stephen de Wystenstanesmere, a Juror for Claverley Manor at the Assizes of 1272 and 1292.

Therefore I set down here a few facts which, if not relevant to the Lea-farm itself, yet concern the Manor of which it was a member. Reginald de Lega, whom I have named under Aston as an Essoignor in a local Suit of 1221, may have been of this place. Richard de la Lee, first Juror for Claverley at the Manorial Inquest of 1255, was undoubtedly so. Again, one Richard de la Lee was eighth Juror of Claverley at the Assizes of 1272. Thomas, styled the Provost of the Lee (a style equivalent to Tho mas de la Lee, Provost), was possibly of this place, and perhaps a Bailiff of Claverley. All that I know of him certainly is that he had two sons, Roger, a Clerk, and John. Of Roger I have much to say. \u2014 In the year 1292, King Edward I grants to his beloved Clerk, Roger de Lee, thirty-one acres of the King's Bosc in Claverley, viz., twenty acres in the heath between Whittimere and Broughton ; seven acres in the Kingesmere, between Broughton, Bobbington, and Gatacre ; three acres in the heath, between Aston, Ludstone, and the boundary of Shropshire and Staffordshire ; and one acre between the King's waste, near his Forest of Morf, and the Manor of Bobbington. The whole was to be held for the life of the Grantee at a rent of 5s. 2d. (i. e. 2d. per acre) .101 At the County Assizes next following (Oct. 1292), Roger de Lee was presented for appropriating and assarting these lands. He pleaded the King's Charter, and the Bailiff of Claverley certified that his rent was not in arrear ; so he was dismissed sine die. In October 1293, at Assizes held at Brug, the Abbot of Haugh mond sued \" Roger, son of Thomas le Provost de la Lee, Clerk, for desseizing him of common pasture in seven acres of moor &c. which pertained to the Abbot's tenure in Beobridge and Broughton. Wil liam de la Lee, as Bailiff of Roger, answered for him, putting in the King's Charter to Roger, and declining to plead further without the King. An adjournment to Easter Term 1294 at Shrewsbury, and again to Michaelmas Term 1294 at Brug, ended in the Abbot's fail ing to appear, whereupon he and his Sureties were declared to be in misericordid.\" At this time Roger de la Lee occurs as a Landholder in Nordley Regis, a matter which will appear in its place.

After an Inquest ad quod damnum, held at Brug on June 6, and a Report by recent Arentators of the Royal Forests, the King grants to his beloved Clerk, Roger de Lee, the same thirty-one acres as before, but to be held in fee, and not merely for life, and at the old rent (5s. 2d.) . The King adds a new grant of twenty-five acres in the Forests of Morf and Kinver, whereof twenty-two were in Morf and three in Kinver, also to be held in fee at a rent of 4s. 6d. (probably 3s. 6d.) . Of the land in Morf, sixteen acres were in the Oldfield between the Blakewall and the Coldewall, and six acres were in the heath between Whittimere, Bobbington, and Broughton.102 On Jan. 22, 1306, the King's Writ of diem clausit extremum issued on the death of Roger de Lee. An Inquest held at Claverley on Feb. 10, reported his tenure in capite most accurately, and how his collective rents to the King were payable through the King's Bailiff at Claverley. His Brother John was his next Heir, and aged fifty on Dec. 21, 1305.103 On May 28, 1306, John de la Leye having done fealty to the King, the Escheator is ordered to take security for bis relief, and give him seizin of his inheritance.104 In 12 Edw. II (1318-9), William, son of Roger de la Lee, fines half a merk with the King for license to enter a certain tenement in Claverley after the decease of John de la Lee.10S I doubt not that this transaction concerned the same family and estate as we have been previously speaking of; but how William de la Lee and Roger his Father were related to John does not appear. A further pursuit of this subject would lead to details which, how ever interesting, belong to a succeeding sera of Shropshire History.106 102 Inquisitions, 28 Edw.

The Family of Brooke had its origin in Claverley, where its elder branch continued to be resident for many Centuries, whilst a younger branch came to be seated at Blacklands, in the neigh bouring Parish of Bobbington. Richard de la Broke, who occurs in 1242, was probably of Claverley: Thomas de la Bruche, who occurs about 1260, was more certainly so. In 1268, we have Geoffrey de la Broke on a Kinver Inquest. From 1299 to 1338, I find Richard de Broke of Claverley some times called Richard atte Broke, sitting on Juries, or attesting deeds at Claverley, Bridgnorth, and Lutley. In 1316, he was Grantee of land in Beobridge, as was his Son Richard, a Clerk, in 1318. The same son occurs with his Father in 1324. In 1342 and 1343, this succession seems to be in Thomas atte Broke of Claverley ; but Randolf atte Broke, who occurs at Enville in 1347, I take to have been ancestor of Brooke of Blacklands, one of whom (deceased in 1385) seems to have married a coheiress of the Gravenors.107 CLAVERLEY CHURCH. Of this Church and its Incumbents, the Deans of St. Mary Magdalene of Bridgnorth, I have given account when speaking of that Collegiate establishment.108 About the end of the seventeenth Century, a number of Coats of Arms adorned the Church, some of them pertinent to our early history of the place, others not so ancient.

Here in English havev teams, with xvm Villains, and v Boors. The former value (of the Manor) was \u00a33. (per annum) : now it is worth \u00a318. Of this land in hides are waste.\"1 In this account one or two coincidences are observable. Statis tically we notice how an unusual increase in the gross value of the Manor was accompanied by a superabundance of the kind of stock primarily necessary to cultivation. The Manor, which in Saxon times was only valued at \u00a33., was, notwithstanding the unculti vated state of a tenth thereof, now worth .\u20ac18. per annum, and was stocked with 34 ox-teams, i. e., four more than it actually required. Hugh de Montgomery held it of the King, not of his Father the Earl, \u2014 a status well illustrated by the almost contemporary Founda tion-Charter of Quatford Church, which tells us of Hugh de Mont gomery and Philip his brother bestowing Burcot (a member of Worfield) on that establishment, and bestowing it independently of their Father.2 When Hugh became Earl of Shrewsbury, his Seigneury over Worfield was of course massed with his other Palatine Honours. Descending in due course to Earl Robert, and then forfeited to Henry I, Worfield came intact to the hands of Henry II, and was thenceforth accounted to be ancient demesne of the Crown. Its fiscal Value, that is, the proportion of the Ferm of Shropshire, which it was supposed to contribute, was \u00a332. Os. 5^d., or nearly an eighth of the whole Firma Comitatus. It was held strictly in demesne by Henry II and Richard I ; but in the reign of John a heavy charge arose upon this portion of the Sheriff's Ferm in manner following : \u2014 Ro^er de Powis, and Jonas, his brother, had held Whittington (Shropshire) and Overton (Flintshire) by authority and grant of Kin\u00b0- Henry II, and by the Serjeantry or service of \" bearing the King's Mandates throughout Wales.\" Meurich, son of Roger de Powis succeeded to that Tenure, and, except so far as he may have been disturbed by the counter-claim of Fitz Warin, held the same throughout the reign of Richard I. 2 Supra, Vol. I, p. 109. 14 1 Domesday, so. 248, b. 1. | III."], [134, "106 WORFIELD. On April 11, 1200, he had King John's confirmation thereof;3 but, dying before August 1 following, the King renewed the said confirmation in favour of Wrenoch and Wenhunwin, sons of Meu rich, stipulating that he, the King, would provide an equivalent, in case their title to Whittington &c. should be insufficient to resist the claims of any other party.4 This doubtless alluded to the then unsatisfied demands of the third Fulk Fitz Warin, which after a time came to be fully recog nized. Wrenoch thus lost Whittington, but was able to fall back on the stipulated alternative, and so to demand an equivalent from the King. Hence the following writ of King John, bearing date at Wood stock on March 26, 1205 :-\u2014 \" The King to the Sheriff of Salop &c. We command you that you cause Goronow (i. e., Gronow or Wrenoch) Fitz Meuric to have x librates of land in any of our Manors without Bruges, wherever said lands shall lie most conveniently for our interests. So as that he (Wrenoch) shall give thereof to Wennovare his Stepmother and Wenunwin his Brother whatever, according to the custom of the Land, he ought to give.\" 5 The Sheriff, it would seem, instantly assigned the -required lands in Worfield, allowing the Grantee a quarter's revenue as if already due, but estimating eight fiscal librates of the Manor as equivalent to the ten librates enjoined by the King's Writ. Hence, at Michaelmas 1207, he discharges himself of an aggre gate liability of \u00a322., i. e., two years and three-quarters' revenue of eight librates of land given in Werefeld to Wrenoc of Wales (Walensi).6 And this charge on the King's Revenue was made by every Sheriff who accounted for Shropshire till Michaelmas 1224 inclusive. During this interval I find two Records very pertinent to Wre noch's Tenure. A return of the year 1211 says that \"Wrenoc Fitz Meuric is holding eight librates of land of the bailiwick of King John, in lieu of ten librates (granted him) in exchange of Witinton, which Fulco Fitz Warin holds. And he (Wrenoc) ought by service to be Latimarius (Interpreter) between England and Wales.7\" On January 29, 1222, Wrenoc appears to havabeen temporarily 3 Rot.

If the Sheriff hath taken anything from Wrenoc's said land, he shall cause it at once to be restored.8 Not stopping to inquire how Wrenoch de Powis, about the year 1224, lost his interest in Worfield, we pass to the time when the whole Manor was given in Fee to a Subject. In October 1232, Ranulph, surnamed Blundevil, the last who held the old Earldom of Chester in its integrity, died without issue. King Henry III had now the means of dissipating that extraordinary Power whose possible antagonism had always been matter of apprehension, nay, whose actual disaffection had some times led to consequences palpably injurious to the Crown. On the present occasion, Henry only partially adopted such a policy ; for the Earldom of Chester was allowed to John Scot Earl of Huntingdon, as son of Maud, the Sister and Coheir of Ranulph Blundevil. However, in less than five years, viz., in June 1237, John Scot was in turn deceased without issue, leaving three surviving Sisters his legal heirs, but to whom the King allowed nothing at all commensurate with the dignity and estate to which they had a claim in common. The Earldom of Chester was thence forth utterly disintegrated, or whatever remained of its Palatine dignity was annexed to the Crown, whilst King Henry allotted to the three Coheiresses a nominal equivalent of their respective rights. Of Ada, the youngest of the Ladies, I am now to speak ; for to her and her husband, Henry de Hastings, were assigned, among other estates, three Shropshire Manors, in partial satisfaction of their claims on the Honour of Chester. Thus in the year 1238 did Worfield, Condover, and Church-Stretton, all of the King's ancient demesne, pass to a subject. From March in that year, the revenue heretofore charged on the Sheriff as accruing from Worfield was deducted from the aggregate ferm of the County. Hence, at Michaelmes 1242, John le Strange, then Sheriff, deducts \u00a3144. 2s. O^d. from his own liabilities at the Exchequer ; \u2014 he deducts it in respect of \" lands given to Henry de Hastinges and Ada his wife iu the Manor of Wurefeud \" four years and a half previously, \" which Manor,\" he 8 Rot. Claus, I, 486."], [136, "108 WORFIELD. adds, is rated at \u00a332. Os. _\\d. in the Corpus Comitatus, according to an Inquisition made thereupon by order of the King. This annual deduction of \u00a332. Os. _\\d. continues, without alteration or remark, in the succeeding Pipe Rolls till that of 1247, when, Ada de Hastings being dead, the Sheriff notifies the continued life interest of her husband in Condover and Worfield, \" by reason of the heirs of Ada his wife whom he has by the said Ada:\" in other words, Henry de Hastings was Tenant by Courtesy of England. So he continued not long ;\u2014 but, dying in 1250, left his son, Henry, and his two daughters, Margery and Hillaria, under age. Worfield for a time will have been in custody of the Guardian or Guardians of young Henry de Hastings, who appears to have arrived at full age in 1258 : but neither these nor some other changes which actually took place are alluded to on the Pipe Rolls, in all of which, till September 1273, the several Sheriffs' entries in regard to Worfield must be taken merely to indicate that they received nothing therefrom, and so were entitled to abate the annual ferm of the County to the extent of \u00a332. Os. _\\d. We must therefore look to other Records for precise informa tion about Worfield after the death of Henry de Hastings in 1250. In 1255, no Inquisition was held as to the state of this Manor, or rather none is preserved, for the feoffment of a subject therein did not preclude such an inquiry. The Jurors of Brug referred to the former connection of Worfield with their town and Castle in terms already quoted.9 At the Assizes of January 1256, the Manor was duly represented by twelve Jurors. I only notice among their concerns the fact that Reginald le Gaugy, whose death I have fully detailed elsewhere,10 was found murdered within the precincts of the Manor, and that he was slain by Giles de Burford, a Clerk.11 The disaffection of Henry de Hastings (II) has been alluded to before. It seems to have begun soon after he came of age. For the principal details I must refer elsewhere.13 On May 4, 1265, a Patent of the Captive King orders a valuation to be made of the Manors of Condover and Worfield, and of certain Manors in Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire, which the King formerly intrusted to Henry de Hastings (I) and Ada his wife, both 9 Supra, Vol. I, p. 279. 10 \" Vol. I, pp. 378, 379.

The Valuers were also to report whether Henry de Hastings, now seized thereof, held anything more in Shropshire.13 The object of this was probably rather to secure than to inquire into young Hastings' Title, which however was seriously invalidated three months later by the result of the Battle of Evesham. A schedule attached to the Pipe Roll of 51 Henry III (1267) shows that Master William de Clifford, as Escheator, had received the issues forth of the lands of Simon de Montfort, late Earl of Leicester, and of Henry de Hastings and other Rebels against the King, viz., on all lands which, having been previously of Royal Demesne, had subsequently been held by the said Rebels. On the list is Worfield, the rents and other issues of which, from Feb. 2, 1266, to Feb. 4, 1268, are acknowledged Jo have been \u00a384. 19s. At the last date, Clifford had handed these estates over to the Prior of Wymundham, as Escheator citra Trent. Meanwhile, that is on July 13, 1267, Hastings had made formal submission to the Crown, and, at instance of Prince Edward, been admitted to the benefits of the Dictum de Kenilworth. Worfield and other Manors were not to be restored to him till Roger le Strange, who had a grant of the fine payable for their redemption, should be fully satisfied.14 Henry de Hastings is said, and with much probability, to have died in 1268. Joan de Cantelupe, his Widow, is mentioned as such in 1269. Their infant son, John de Hastings, whom Dugdale has represented as of full age in 1 Edw. I (1273), was assuredly still in minority ten years later. The estate which had been his Father's remained either unredeemed or else in the hands of Tenants appointed by the Crown. On Nov. 29, 1274, Worfield was held by the Earl of Cornwall,15 that is, by Edmund Plantagenet, the King's Cousin; but whether as having entitled himself to the redemption thereof, or as Guardian of the heir, we are not informed. In October 1283, that is, at about the period when I suppose John de Hastings to be passing out of minority, the King ordered a valuation to be made of the Manors of Worfield and Condover. The Jurors who valued Worfield reported the rents thereof to amount to \u00a337. 12s. 6d., the pleas and perquisites 13 Patent, 49 Hen. III.

It wras among the estates which he held at his death in 1313, and which he transmitted to his descendants. At the Assizes of 1292 he was questioned for certain franchises exercised by him here, viz., the holding of a Court twice in the year, Infangthef, and the assizing of bread and beer ; which matter Hugh de Louther was to prosecute under writ of Quo Waranto. So far the Assize-Roll. Hugh de Louther's writ of Quo Waranto took a wider range than is thus indicated. He questioned John de Hastings' right to hold the Manor at all,.and alleged the seizin of King Henry III and the hereditary right of his son Edward I, then reigning. Hastings acknowledged the seizin of Henry III, but showed how that King had committed the Manor to his (Hastings') father, Henry, until provision should be made elsewhere, to compensate him for his share of the Honour of Chester.17 John de Hastings died, as I have said, in 1313. He was suc ceeded by his Son, another John, who dying in 1324-5, Worfield was assigned as the dower of his Widow, Julian, daughter and Heir of Thomas de Leybourn. She took the Manor to a second husband, Thomas le Blount, in 13.25-6 ; and to a third husband, William de Clinton, afterwards Earl of Huntingdon, in 1329. This illustrious nobleman, at his death in 1354, left Juban, his wife, still surviving. She died in 1367, when Worfield went to her Grandson, John de Hastings Earl of Pembroke. For these and further particulars of this great family I refer elsewhere.18 As regards the Under-tenants of Worfield, I must premise that, in the absence both of early Court- Rolls and private Deeds of any kind, I should vainly devote my space to any classified account of each Township or Member of the Manor. I must therefore speak both of places and persons in the aggregate, adding such parenthetical or other remarks as will enable any one interested in such a matter to recognise the various tenancies and the names of those who were associated therewith. At Michaelmas 1162, the Men of Wereffeld are recorded to have paid into the King's Treasury the large fine of twenty merks. It 16 Inquisitions, 11 Edw. I, No. 57. 17 Placita de Quo Waranto, pp. 677-8. | \u00ab Dugdale's Baronage, I, 576, 577, 530, 531."], [139, "WORFIELD. 111 is expressed to be pro gersumd, that is, either in earnest or in full for some privilege which they sought, or else in satisfaction of some penalty which they had incurred. The mode of entering the matter on the Pipe Roll would seem to make the former more probable. At the Forest Assizes in 1167, the Manor of Worfield was assessed or fined one merk. At those of 1185, the Town (Villata) of Werefeld was amerced \u00a32. for wasting the King's Woods. At the Assizes of October 1203, the Manor of Worfel seems to have been duly represented as a distinct Liberty, but no local con cerns are entered under the Heading intended for the same. In 1204, the \" Men of Wurfeld gave the King a fine of ten merks that they might be free from toll (throughout the realm).\" The King's Writ, memorialising the Officers of the Exchequer as to this Franchise, specified also freedom from pannage; but the profferers of the Fine had paid it into the Treasury as a Fine for Toll only.19 At the Forest Assize of March 1209, among those assessed for imbladements within regard of Morf Forest, were \u2014 Osbert Fitz John, Roger Bungi, and William his Brother, all apparently of Swancote; also Roger Wheeler (Rotarius), William Fitz Christian, Osbert Fitz Leveneth, and Richard his Brother, \u2014 all assessed under Bromlegh (Bromley). At the County Assizes, Nov. 1221, the Manor of Wyrfelt was represented by six Jurors and a Provost, whose names are not given. Whilst the first Henry de Hastings was Lord of Worfield (i. e. 1238 \u2014 1250), an Extent or Valuation of the Manor was made by order of the King. This Extent is not dated, but the names of the twelve Knights who made it are consistent with the period to which I assign it. It contains some curious particulars, local and statistical. \u2014 There were in Worfield three virgates and three-quarters of arable land held in demesne, which (reckoning the virgate at sixty acres, and each acre to be worth 4c?. per annum) realised \u00a33. 15s. Of meadow-land, eight acres and three-quarters, at 3s. per acre, realised \u00a31. 6s. 3d. The pasturage of eighteen oxen is valued at 2d. a head yearly, of three boars at the same rate, of twelve cows at 4d. a head, of twelve sows with their litters (exitu) at Ad. each sow, of 500 sheep at \\d. per head. The Bosc called Sudlegh was worth 40s. per annum. Two Mills were worth \u00a37. 6s. Sd. There were four virgates and three-quarters held in Villainage, whereof 19 Rot. Pip. 6 John, Salop.

The hamlets of Stapelford and Ewyk (Wyken) are separately valued. Of Akelington (Ackleton) it is said that it produces a ferm oi 60s.50 Of Ewdness we hear, that in that hamlet a certain free man holds a hide of land for a ferm of 4s., or else by service of conveying the ferm of the Vill (of Worfield) to London.21 The hamlet of Holdington (Oldington) was held by service of conveying the writs of the Custos of the Manor any-whither within the County. After Esterhul valued, we have Riwyton (Roughton), held by service of keeping the wood of Morf. In the hamlet of Halene (Hallon) was a Smith (Faber). The Pleas and Perquisites of the Manorial Court were stated at the large sum of \u00a320. per annum. The tallage of free-men was estimated to yield \u00a33. 14s. Id. per annum. The Church, which was in the King's gift, was worth 100 merks (\u00a366. 13s. 4d.) per annum. The whole Valuation amounted to \u00a3140. 0s. 3d?2 At the Assizes of January 1256, Reginald de Bromley appeared as Bailiff of Wurefeld, with twelve Jurors, whose names were \u2014 Laurence de Oldinton (Oldington), William de Swancote, William de Halvescote (Allscot), William de Hodileg, William le Irreys (Irish), Adam de Alen (Hallon), William de Hulton (Hilton), Thomas Griffin, Roger de Bremplee (perhaps Bentley), William de Oldinton, Thomas de Akinton (Ackleton), and Robert de Atterhull. At the Assizes of September 127.2, the Chief Bailiff or Provost of Worfeld was Robert de Stapelford (Stableford). His eleven associates were \u2014 Stephen de Ewyken (Wyken), William de Rowe lawe (Rowley), William de Bradeneye (Bradney), Roger de Che terton (Chesterton), Boneyt and Thomas de Stanlowe (Stanlow), Roger de Akelinton (Ackleton), William Gerbaut (probably of Roughton), William Atte- Forde, Robert de Hoccumb (Hoccom), and Richard de Alvescote (Allscot).

These three members of Worfield require to be noticed somewhat more formally than by the above miscellaneous method. They were each of them at a very early period \u2014 perhaps the reign of Henry I \u2014 bestowed on Tenants by Serjeantry. All that I have to say of \u2014 Ackleton has been said under Badger (whose Lords held the vill by service of keeping Shirlot Forest),23 or else under Worfield, where the Jury Lists contain the names of some Under-Tenants. Ewdness I have also spoken of,24 and most inadvertently ; for I have treated it as a member of Stockton. It was always a member both of the Manor and Parish of Worfield. To the specific facts connected with Ewdness I have nothing further to add, but only to retract another error (the sequence of the first), viz., where I have supposed it to have been reunited to Le Strange's tenure in Stockton. Roughton. \u2014 From time immemorial, half a virgate was held in capite at Roughton, by one whose service was to keep that part of Morf Forest which lay adjacent to Worfield. Henry II had not reigned four years before he confirmed this land to Gerbod Fitz Gerbod, his hereditary Forester, as his right, and in form following : \u2014 \" Henricus Rex Angli\u00e6, Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6 et Comes Andegavi\u00e6 Willielmo filio Alani et Willielmo filio Ulgeri,25 et aliis Baronibus et fidelibus de Salopscire salutem.

Of this fine he still owed \u00a32. 8s. in September 1202. Meanwhile, in 1201, I find a separate amercement of 20s. set upon Gilbert Forester and Richard and William Burlin collectively, \u2014 because their bailiwick was not well kept: and this debt was in 1202 charged against Gilbert Forester and Richard Fitz Burlin, but^ without any liquidation then or afterwards.27 At the Forest Assize of March 1209, the Justices directed that inquiry should be made as to the issues forth of the lands of the Foresters of Claverlegh and Urfeld since the time when they were removed from their Forestership. Whatever forfeiture is here indicated, it is clear that their office was not ultimately lost to the race of Gerbod. I cannot supply the direct descent to Roger Gerbod Forester, who appears to have been dead in 1262, when at the Forest Assizes, and under the head ing \u2014 Essonia Mortis, his Essoignor is said to be Henry fitz Elias. On the same list I should observe, that the name of one Henry Forester of Morf appears, who would also seem to be deceased. In 1272, we have had William Gerbaut on a Worfield Jury. This Wihiam was, I believe, Father of Alice Gerbod, who, if so, was his sole heir. I have little hesitation in assigning as the husband of Alice that Robert de Bromleye who was on the Worfield Jury of 1292. More sure am I that William de Rucheton (Roughton), who appears as a King's Forester of the fee on the Great Perambulation of June 6, 1300,28 was the son and heir of Alice, and was acting on that occasion as her representative, he being then at least forty-four years of age, and she proportionably older. It will presently appear that William de Roughton's real or paternal name was Bromley. On April 1, 1306, died Alice Gerbot. On April 20, the King's Writ of \"Diem clausit extremum \" issued as on the death of a Tenant in capite. On Sunday, May 15, the Inquest post mortem met 26 Forest Rolls, Salop, No. iii. 27 Rot.

On December 15, 1316, William de Roughton was deceased, and an Inquisition held at Worfield found him to have held in capite by serjeantry of keeping half the Forest of Morf. His tenure was half a virgate (equal to thirty acres) and a rood of meadow-ground. His brother and heir, Roger, was aged fifty at Christmas 1315.30 On Sept. 28, 1318, the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum announces the death of this Brother, as I presume, under the name of Roger de Bromleye. An Inquest, held at Brug on October 14 following, found that he held two-thirds of half a virgate in Rowton within Worfeld Manor by service of keeping the King's Forest of Morf: that on December 21, 1317, his son and heir William had attained the age of twenty-six years.31 At Michaelmas 1319, the King's Escheator accounts for the sum of Is., being the issue of one messuage, twenty acres of land, and one rood of meadow in Routon, which were formerly Roger de Bromley's, but had since been given up by Royal Warrant to William de Bromley, his son and heir.32 I conclude this notice of Roughton with a License of 1345, which enables William de Bromley, Forester, to grant to Walter le fitz Reginald of the Hay, and his wife Agnes, daughter of the said William, in tail, a messuage and half-virgate in Roughton, and the bailiwick of half the forestership of Morf towards Worfeld.33 Thus a second time did this estate lapse to the female line.

I have no direct notice of this Church till the reign of King John, who twice presented Incumbents thereto. On May 27, 1226, King Henry III having, by advice of Ms Prelates, allowed that tithes of hay and mills should be paid through all his demesnes, the Constable of Brug is ordered to see that tithes of Pendeston Mill be paid to the Church in whose parish the said Mill was situated.34 We have seen that before the middle of the thirteenth century the Church of Worfield was valued by a Jury of Knights at 100 merks (\u00a366. 13s. 4d.). The Taxation of 1291, placing it in the Deanery of Lapley and Trysull, and Archdeaconry of Stafford, values it at \u00a333. 6s. 8d. (50 merks).35 The Manorial Jurors of 1292 returned it as worth 60 merks (\u00a340.). Hitherto the Advowson of Worfield had been in the Crown, and had not gone with the Manor to the Lords Hastings. It happened that Walter de Langton Bishop of Lichfield purchased the Manor of Greneford (County Middlesex) with intent to bestow it on his Cathedral Church, for the foundation of certain Chantries therein, and as an eleemosynary offering for the soul of King Edward I. But King Edward II, wishing to have this Manor of Greneford, obtained it from the Bishop; and by Patent dated May 15, 1318, gave the Bishop, by way of recompense, the two Advowsons of Chesterton in Warwickshire, and Worfield in Shropshire.36 Bishop Langton obtained a Bull from Pope John XXI, dated at Avignon, Oct. 30, 1321, and confirming him in the possession of these Advowsons.37 On May 28, 1318, and on July 7, 1320, Bishop Langton pre sented to this Church, as I shah presently show in the List of Incumbents. On June 29, 1321, the Rector of Worfield being dead and the Living vacant, Bishop Langton gave it in commendam for the 34 Claus, II, 152-3. cester, by which it would seem that on April 19, 1301, King Edward I, being at Worcester, granted the Church of \" Wrhfeld,\" to Worcester Priory.

The Bishop's reasons for this were \u2014 (1) that the Church, on account of the great Cure of Souls annexed thereto, needed no little and discreet management (regimine non modico et discreto) ; (2) that he himself could not at present make any final arrangement about its management, as he was impeded from doing so by certain legitimate causes; (3) lest, in course of time, the Church itself should suffer loss spiritually and temporally, and its Cure be neglected; (4) that its buildings, Chancel, and embellishments should be repaired in the best manner, and properly maintained. Bishop Langton's designs at this period were probably less to provide for the proper maintenance of an Incumbent of the Church than to convert the bulk of its rich income to the uses of his Cathedral. His death within five months of the above commendam will have prevented any further or immediate steps in such a direction; but we know from good authority that he lent 200 merks to the Dean and Canons of Lichfield, wherewith to pursue his object of appropriating the Rectories of Worfield and Chester ton to that Collegiate body. With that sum, payments were to be made till such time as a stated income from those Churches should be secured to the Chapter. Worfield Church became a Vicarage in the time of Bishop Northburgh, Langton's Successor (1322 \u2014 1358). The Rectorial income was simultaneously appropriated to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield ; but the specific purpose to which they applied it does not satisfactorily appear. My authority, however, seems to state that they devoted it to the Cathedral Buildings.38 So then the local benefits contemplated by the Saxon Founders of Worfield Church went to the adornment of Lichfield Cathedral ; and 38 \" Ex altera ecclesia (scilicet Worfeld) Dominus Decanus et Canonici Residen tiarii templum instaurant.\" (Whitlocke, in Anglia Sacra, p. 477.) Whitlocke further states (page 451), that in the time of Bishop Scrope (1394), the Chapter of Lichfield still \"owed 200 merks for its expenses in the appropriation of Worfeld Church to the Collegiate body, under authority of the Bishop of Rome.\" His meaning is obscure in tbis, and still more so in the next passage, which however I take to indicate the mode of Belf-taxation by which the Chapter of Lichfield then decided, not indeed to liquidate their debt, but to pay other current and neces sary expenses. \u2014 I am particular in offering this inter pretation, because a more obvious con struction of the passage would lead us to an inverse supposition, viz. that the appro priation of Worfield Church was devoted to the current expenses of the Chapter (specifically the securing their introit-fees andrents, and the repairing of their robes), and that the Chapter taxed themselves in 1394, for the sake of liquidating their debt of 200 merks."], [148, "118 WORFIELD. \u2014 THE CHURCH. Bishop Langton's Charter of commendam, professing the purest and fullest regard for parochial interests, was written at a time when he was meditating a scheme for the abridgment of those interests. In 1341, the Parish of Worthfield was taxed to the Ninth, with out any specific reference to the Church Taxation, and the Asses sors erroneously classing it as in the Deanery of Stottesden. They assessed it at 20 merks only, because the growing corn was de stroyed by storms and a very bad season ; because there were fewer sheep than formerly in the parish ; because the small-tithes, tithes of mills, offerings, heriots, glebe, and other profits of the Church were not to be reckoned as increasing the assessment; because, lastly, many Tenants had quitted under stress of poverty, and their land lay untilled.39 In 1534-5, the Valor gives a full account of the Rectorial and Vicarial incomes arising from Worfield. The receipts of the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, as Parsons of the Church, amounted, on an average, to \u00a351. per annum, viz. from land \u00a32., from corn-tithes \u00a324., from tithes of wool and lamb \u00a320., from hay-tithes \u00a34., from hemp and flax and other small tithes \u00a31.40 The benefice of the Vicar (John Walker) was at the same time valued at \u00a316. 16s. lOd. viz.

His son Walter, thus advanced, is mentioned as holding this Rectory in November 1221, when at the County Assizes presentments were made as to the Incumbency of all Churches of the King's gift. Walter de Cantilupe probably continued in this Rectory till 1236, when, on August 30, he was elected Bishop of Worcester. He was not con secrated till May 3, 1237, owing to some necessary preliminaries, among which we find, in strange contrast to modern ideas, that he was ordained Deacon not before April 4, 1237, and Priest only on April 18 following. William de Kilkenny was presented to Worfield Church on Sept. 28, 1236, by Letters Patent of King Henry III. This illus trious person, better known as Archdeacon of Coventry, and better still as Lord Chancellor of England, was consecrated Bishop of Ely on August 15, 1255. He survived his consecration little more than a year. The Patent appointing Kilkenny's successor at Wor field bears date Dec. 20, 1254. That Successor, no less illustrious than Kilkenny, was \u2014 Henry de Wengham, another Lord Chancellor, and conse crated Bishop of London on Feb. 15, 1260. I have spoken of Wengham before as Prebendary of Alveley, in the Collegiate Church of Bridgnorth.46 His preferment was enormous. A Pa tent of July 19, 1259 (three weeks after the King had assented to his election to the See of London), allows him to retain all his be nefices as long as the Pope should not prevent him.

He had previously succeeded Wengham in the Prebend and Church of Alveley, as I have already noticed.48 Penne was living in Oct. 1292, but, at the same time, \u2014 John de Teford (or Leford) was returned as Incumbent of this Rectory by previous collation of King Edward I.49 John Bensted was presented to this Church by Edward I, in 45 Rot.

The first intelligence which I have of this Chantry is on Sept. 13, 1345, when Bishop Northburgh admits \u2014 Thomas de Worfeld, Chaplain, thereunto, on presentation of Sir William de Kyrkeby, Rector of Worfield.60 In the Valor of 1534-5, under Worfield Church, we find that John Lee, Chaplain, was in receipt of \u00a32. per annum, paid to him by the Churchwardens, for certain lands placed out on feoffment.

Again we notice how cultivation rather than hidage decided the Manorial values recorded in Domesday. We are also assured of the fallacy of all calculations which estimate the Domesday hide to have any relation to the Carucate, or to be a measure of areal extent. Alveley, like Claverley and Worfield, came to the hands of Henry II, undiminished by any previous Feoffment, and reputed to be a Manor of ancient demesne. Within a year, probably within two months, after his accession, that King granted it in inheritance to Guy le Strange by service of half a Knight's-Fee. The Ferm of the County was hereby diminished to the extent of \u00a35. 10s. per annum, such being the fi^t value of Alveley. We know from the Pipe Rolls, that from arUPtfter Michaelmas 1155, the Sheriff received nothing accruing from Alveley. The loss of the Pipe Roll of 1 Henry II (Sept. 1155) prevents our ascertaining, hy that evidence, the precise period, among the first nine months of his reign, in which the King made this grant. The point is an im portant one, as it would tend to show the particular crisis of events and the probable circumstances, under which Henry II showed a favour to one of those Brethren, three of whom experienced his early patronage, but whose origin and previous history are as uncer tain as the nature of their claims on the King's generosity. \u00c6 Fortunately this doubt as to a precise date may partially be' removed by the actual existence of the Royal Charter to Guy le Strange. \u2014 \" Henry, King of England and Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Earl of Anjou, to the Bishop of Chester, and the Justices and Barons and Sheriff and Ministers and all his faithful of Salopesbyr, Greeting.

When I say that in February 1154, Henry II, after bringing the disaffected Earl of Albemarle to terms at York, returned to London by way of Nottinghamshire, \u2014 probably to deal with Wilbam Peverel, who did not however abide his approach, \u2014 I have, as I think, fixed the date of this deed. If rightly, it has, as belonging to that spe cific period, certain significancies foreign to the immediate matter in hand. \u2014 It tells us inferentially something of the state of Shrop shire at a very dark period, and of the early reorganization of his Exchequer by Henry II ; also it embodies certain expressions, which, used as matter of routine in such documents, are not apparently to be taken quite literally.4 But I must now address myself to a matter more proper to this account of Alveley, and endeavour to give some account of the origin of its first Feoffee, Guy le Strange, whose Brothers, John and Hamo, as well as himself, were Grantees of Henry II within three years of his accession. We have only one account of the origin of this family, and that, though adopted by Glover and Dugdale, is only a tradition, several details of which are demonstrably false. The Fitz- Warine Chro nicle tells us that William Peverel (of Nottingham, of course) advertised through many lands a Tournament to be held at his -^istle in the Peak, whereat he who acquitted himself best should have to _wife Melette, Peverel's youngest niece, and with her the Lordshipp Whittington in Shropshire ; \u2014 that to this Tournament came Guarine de Metz of Lorrain (eventually the Victor), also Owen Prince of Wales, and ten sons of John Duke of Brittany, and some others, whose existence seems more or less fabulous. After the Tournament, says the same authority, Guy, the youngest of the ten Brothers of Brittany, \"remained in England and conquered with the sword many fair lands, and he was called Guy le Estraunge, and from him came all the great Lords of England who have the surname of Estraunge.\" 5 Now leaving to a note the many discrepancies which are here embodied 6 it is evident that, if there is a particle of fact in the 4 I mean specifically the King's address ing a Sheriff in the Deed, when, as yet, Shropshire had none of his appoint ment. Also the expression, \" qu\u00e6 solebat mihi reddere in firma mea,\" would at first sight imply the King's accession, not a few months only, but rather two years at least before. 5 Bistory of Fulk Fitz Warine (edited for the Warton Club, by Thomas Wright, Esq., 1855), pp. 18-23. 6 William Peverel of Nottingham, Lord of the Peak, had nothing whatever to do with Whittington.

The advent of Guy le Strange, as yet unmarried, at such a period, is irreconcilable with the fact that the three Brothers, whom this narrative would make his sons, were all enfeoffed by Henry II at a time when, according to the same narrative, the eldest of them could not have been of age. I look now to other sources for some probable theory as to the origin and rise of the house of \u2014 LE STRANGE. When, in the year 1165, account was taken of the Knights' - Fees, which, in different Counties, belonged to the Barony of Fitz Alan, five fees were recorded as constituting his Norfolk Fief. These five fees were apparently of old feoffment, and the first named of the five was then (1165) held by John le Strange; \u2014 in other words, the Ancestor of John le Strange, or John le Strange himself, had been enfeoffed by the Ancestor of William Fitz Alan, before the death of Henry I (1135), in a Knight's-Fee in Norfolk, which Fee was in 1165 held by John le Strange. Now, two facts with regard to this John le Strange are further deducible from the best authorities, viz., that he must have been born before the year 1132,8 and that his Mother was a Suffolk Lady, but not an Heiress. So then the inferences are that John le Strange inherited his Norfolk Fee (it was Hunstanton) from his Father, and that his Father, or Grandfather, was the original Feoffee thereof. What then was the name of, or what other mention have we of, any Le Strange of Norfolk who, living before the year 1135, may fairly be presumed to have been the Father or Grandfather of John le Strange? A long search which I have made with reference to this question has met with a success seldom attainable in matters of such remote antiquity. \u2014 bit they were his Sisters, not his Nieces, and neither of them was at any time wife of Guarin de Metz. The Sons of the latter are moreover found attesting Deeds at a period when, according to this narrative, their Father was yet unmarried, for it ex pressly says that he \"had neither wife nor child.\" Lastly, John Duke of Brittany is a person unknown to any other Record. 7 Liber Niger, I, p. 142. 8 I merely name this year as a limit, not as conveying my own idea of the \u00e6ra of John le Strange.

His grant included lands &c. in Kemestun, and the first lay witness to his deed was Rodland Extraneus.9 But more than this, Alan Fitz Flaald and Adelina his wife, the known Ancestors of Fitz Alan, made, and, as I think, early in the reign of Henry I, a grant to the same Priory.10 Their grant included land in \" Kameston.\" It was attested, among others, by Ruald Extraneus, Gorhannus, and Henry de Pagrave. Now, John Extraneus, Herbert Fitz Gurant, and William de Pagrave, who held fees under Fitz Alan in 1165, were, I imagine, the Sons or Grandsons of these witnesses. Substituting therefore Ruald or Roland le Strange for an imaginary John Duke of Brittany, as the Ancestor of the Stranges, we can go no higher nor further than to suggest that this Roland was a Foreigner, perhaps a Breton. With regard to his succession, it is possible that that Guy whom the Legend announces as Ancestor of all the Stranges may have been son of Ruald and Father of John. At least we must, for the present, accept the statement of the Legend, which implies that a common ancestor of the Stranges was named Guy ; we must accept it only because we cannot disprove it, and because the Chronicle from which it is taken embodies a great deal of truth, however mixed with falsehood. We now pass to greater certainties. \u2014 The family of Le Strange, at the accession of Henry II, consisted of at least four Brethren. Their names were John, Guy, Hamo, and Ralph ; and probably I mention them in the order of their seniority, though there may be some doubt about the position of Hamo. Again, Hamo, Guy, and John were each enfeoffed by Henry II in Shropshire before that King had reigned four years. The respective dates of their feoffments were the reverse of the presumed order of their Seniority, but the respective values of their feoffments were in accordance with the said presumption. The King's grant to Hamo Le Strange was of Cheswardine, a Manor of \u00a34. annual value ; that to Guy le Strange has already been detailed ; that to John le Strange was of Ness (now Great Ness), of \u00a37. 10s. annual value. Before Michaelmas 1160, Hamo le Strange was deceased, \u2014 and probably without issue, for his Bro ther John became Tenant in capite oi Cheswardine. 9 -\u00bb Castle Acre Chartulary (Harl.

Soon after his feoffment by Henry II, he had a grant of lands in Warwickshire from WiUiam Fitz Alan ; and on the death of the latter Baron, about Easter 1160, Guy le Strange not only was appointed to succeed him as Sheriff of Shropshire, but had custody of his Barony during the long minority of his Son. At Michaelmas 1160, Le Strange accounts for a year's ferm of the County, and half a year's ferm of the escheated Barony.11 He continued in both trusts till Christmas 1164, when Geoffrey de Vere, who had married Isabel de Say, widow of the deceased Baron, was, and apparently on that ground, appointed to the Shrievalty.12 Meantime, that is in 1162, Guy le Strange is excused 39s., being his own proportion of the Danegeld assessed by him in Shropshire, and a charge of \u00a317. 3s. 5 c?., which he made for repairs at Shrews bury Castle, on quitting office, was aUowed by writ of the King, not as tested by Visors in the usual way, but solely on credit of the Sheriff's word (per fidem ipsius Widonis).13 In 1165-6, Guy le Strange's acknowledgment of his tenure in capite is very brief. It merely says that he holds AJvindeleg of the King by service of half a Knight.14, His probable tenure of Badger at the same time, under Osbern Fitz Hugh, has already been noticed. His tenure under Fitz Alan is entered as half a Knight's Fee oi new feoffment.15 The lands constituting the same are known to have lain at Stretton-upon-Avon (afterwards called Stretton-super- Dunsmore) in Warwickshire. In 1168, Guy le Strange, accounting for the year's ferm of Fitz Alan's Barony, records a gift of \u00a370. which he and his Brother John had been allowed by the King, out of the issues thereof.16 At Michaelmas 1 1 70, Geoffrey de Vere having previously deceased, Guy le Strange was reinstated in the Shrievalty of Shropshire. At Michaelmas 1171, he accounts both for a year's ferm of the County and a year's ferm of the Honour of William Fitz Alan. Besides his receipts in these capacities, he and his Brother John had had n is 13 ji0f j>ip de eisdem annis. Pipard, Sheriff of Gloucestershire.

The personal service of Guy le Strange, Sheriff of Shropshire, in the army of Leicester, in the summer of 1173, as weU as many other of his official acts, have been before recited.17 Nor were his services unrequited.- \u2014 I have already recorded circumstances which show that in the year 1175 or 1176, or both, Henry II visited Shropshfre, and that Guy le Strange was in attendance on the King.18 Some other coincidences, not before noticed, occurred about the same time. At Michaelmas 1175, Guy le Strange, though still Sheriff, rendered his last account of the Ferm of Fitz Alan's Honour. He had received the issues thereof only during three quarters of the preceding fiscal year, \u2014 in other words, his trust expired about Midsummer 1175, when it may be presumed the heir, WiUiam Fitz Alan (II), came of age. Again, at Michaelmas 1175, Guy le Strange accounted as Sheriff for a sum of 100s., viz., for the ferm of Weston (Weston under Red-Castle), a Manor which had escheated into the King's hands seven years previously, and had produced a similar revenue in six preceding years. This payment in 1175 was the last made by Guy le Strange on that account, for he himself had at the time a grant of the Manor from the King. The Royal Charter on this occasion is preserved, not indeed the original, but the enrolment thereof. It reiterates the King's former grant of Alveley, and so shall be given. \u2014 \"Henry King of England &c. to his Archbishops &c. Know ye that I have conceded and given, and by this present Charter have confirmed, to Wido Extraneus, Weston, which was wont to pay me annually 100s. and Alvineleg, which was wont to pay me in my ferm 110s., to hold to him and his heirs, of me and my heirs, by service of one Knight.

In January 1177, Guy le Strange attended the great Court and Council which Henry II then held at Northampton. I learn this from his attestation of a general Charter 2l of confirmation which the King expedited at Northampton to Thomas, son of Robert Fitz Noel, and which can be proved to have passed at the time stated. A further probability is associated with this Charter ;\u2014 I think it marks the time when Thomas Noel had already married Margaret eldest daughter of Guy le Strange. Before Michaelmas 1178, died John le Strange, elder brother and almost constant associate of Guy. Nor did the latter long sur vive. At Michaelmas 1179, he rendered his last account as Sheriff of Shropshire ; and, though in the succeeding fiscal year he satis fied a balance of \u00a319. 6s. Sd. which stood against him at the Ex chequer, he must have died early therein : \u2014 for at Michaelmas 1180, the new Sheriff takes credit for no part of the year's ferm of Alveley, as of land given to Wido le Strange. \u2014 The entry ceases, i. e. the Manor and its revenue were in manu Regis, till livery should be given to the Heir. Of that however presently. \u2014 Guy le Strange thus dying, as I suppose, at the close of 1179, left a widow, Mary, and a Son, Ralph. Ralph was apparently a little under age, and the survivor of two other sons, Guy and Hamo,22 who wiU have predeceased their Father. Guy also left three daughters, \u2014 Margaret, Joan, and MatUda, \u2014 of whom I shall say more hereafter. Guy le Strange's attestations of Charters are very numerous, but illustrative of no matters of date or genealogy not already exhibited. His connection with Fitz Alan's interests and estates is much more apparent in these attestations than his own position as Sheriff. He made two grants to Haughmond Abbey. The first, in which his wife Mary joined, was of his Mill at Stretton-upon-Avon, and also of his Mill at Alveley. It must have passed about 1171, for it is attested by William son of William Fitz Alan, not previously of attesting age, and was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on May 14, 1172.23 His second grant was of the Mill of Osbertune (Osbaston, near 21 Dodsworth, Vol. 130, so. 119. b. traneus, Wido and Hamo his sons ; Tho mas Noel, &c. 22 The testing clauses of two cotempo rary Charters (Monasticon, V, 359, xvKi, and Barl.

Knockin), with the site thereof, and seems to have passed shortly before his death.24 It is the earliest authentic notice of his con nection with the neighbourhood of Knockin, the Castle whereof he is said to have founded. Mary le Strange, widow of Guy, was hardly, I think, Mother of all his children, for Ralph, one of the youngest, cannot have been born later than 1161, whUst Mary herself, being then about sixteen years of age, had two other husbands before she became the wife of Guy le Strange. She was descended from Knights and Barons, was living in 1186, and then aged forty, and still a Widow in the King's gift. She had her dowers in several Counties: amongst others in Norfolk, where she held Rungeton of the Fief of Warren of Wirmgay.25 From which of her husbands she derived that Manor I cannot say, but it was not from Guy le Strange.26 Ralph le Strange, son and heir of Guy, though apparently under age at his Father's death, had already appeared in more than one instance as a witness of Charters which concerned his Father or Relations. He does not seem to have had livery till Michaelmas 1182. Then however the Sheriff (Hugh Pantulf), by special order of the King, made over to him two years' revenue of Alveley which he, the Sheriff, had hitherto retained in hand, pro bably in expectation of such special order. These two years' revenue arose between Michaelmas 1179 and Michaelmas 1181; but the third and current year's revenue is attributed to Ralph le Strange in the usual way,27 and proves him to be now (Michaelmas 1182) in full possession. What the Fine was for, which in 1190 Ralph le Strange made with the Crown, I cannot say. He paid fifteen merks through the Sheriff in a summary but unexplained way.28 In 1194, Ralph le Strange was in the King's service at Car rechova, where were some silver mines belonging to the Crown.

Archbishop of Canterbury (then Chief Justice of Engll\u00bbd), he had certified the Sheriff of Shropshire as to the sums due for livery of certain Knights and serving-men who guarded the said mines. In 1195, Ralph le Strange was still in that service, for the Sheriff had paid him \u00a320. for fortifications at Carrechova, and \u00a311. 10s. for corn and hogs delivered to him as Custos of that Castle. On May 12, 1195, a suit being called on in the Courts at West minster to which John le Strange was a party, and he not appear ing, excuse was made for him on the strength of a warrant of Archbishop Hubert, which certified him to be in the King's service in place of Ralph le Strange, who was sick.29 So then Ralph le Strange, while Castellan of Carrechova, and in the prime of life, was seized with that sickness which we shaU now learn to have ended in death about Midsummer 1195; for at Michaelmas in that year the King's Escheator had received three months' issues of the Manors of Alveley and Weston, then in the King's hands.30 The next year the same Escheator received half a year's issues of those Manors, viz., up to Easter 1196,31 about which time, as will presently appear, the heirs of Ralph le Strange obtained livery. Ralph le Strange's foundation of the Hospital of the Holy Trinity at Bridgnorth, and his endowment thereof with lands at Alveley, are matters which have been already treated of.33 He followed his Father's example also in a liberal patronage of Haughmond Abbey, to which he gave the Advowson of Knockin Chapel. He gave to the same house some land in Alveley, with the Tenants thereof (apparently holding in villanage), and a right of common-pasture in the Manor.33 29 The Roll, from which this extract is taken, is entitled in the Official Index, \u2014 \" No. 60. Placita incerti temporis Regis Johannis.\" Its internal evidence proves it to be a Roll of Easter Term, 6 Richard I. answers in the Roll of Escheats.\" In point of fact, in these two years Ralph le Strange had received nine months', his heirs six months', and the Escheator the intervening nine months' revenue. The Sheriff had received nothing. That was all he meant to imply by entries which would seem at first sight to charge the Escheator with all the receipts. 32 Vol. I, p. 343, et seq. 30 Escheator's Roll, in Rot. Pip.T&lc.l.

This Ralph is usually distinguished from a Cotemporary of the same name as \" Ralph son of Wido le Strange.\" His high position in one or two important testing clauses, where he is not thus dis tinguished, sufficiently marks his identity. His heirs were his three Sisters \u2014 Margaret, wife of Thomas Noel ; Joan, wife of Richard de Wapenburi ; and Matilda, wife of Griffin de Sutton. The said husbands of these Ladies, in the year 1196, fined 200 merks with the King \"for having all the land which was before Ralph le Strange's, together with the fortress (muuicione) which is called Cnukin.\" The whole sum was paid before the end of King Richard's reign.34 At Michaelmas 1197, the Sheriff discharges his account of the County-_Fmw of \" 1 10s. in Alvedeleg, assigned to Thomas Noel, Richard de Wappenbiri, and Griffin Fitz Yerveth, by Writ-Royal.\" I must now say something of each of these Coheirs, premising that within three years of their succession they all concurred in resigning their shares of Knockin to John le Strange of Ness (their first Cousin), receiving however an equivalent elsewhere. It is evident that a Border Fortress and estate was recognised as no fit matter of coparcenary among females. Thomas Noel, whose wife Margaret seems to have been the eldest of Ralph le Strange's sisters, was eldest son and heir of Robert Fitz Noel, a person of great estate in Staffordshire, viz., Lord of Milnmeese, EUenhaU, Seighford Podmore, and other lands, including Ranton, where be founded an Augustine Priory, in sub jection to the Shropshire Abbey of Haughmond. Robert Fitz Noel, living in 1166, had before 1177 been suc ceeded by his son Thomas, the subject of our present notice. The public employments of Thomas Noel indicate a man of high influence and trust. From Michaelmas 1182 to Midsummer 1183, he accounted as Fermor for the issues of the escheated See of Lichfield.35 Again, from Feb. 2, 1184, to April 1, 1184, hefermed nual rent, which Ralph used to pay the Canons for land in Nordstepe. 1182), and from thence till Gerard la Pucelle (elected in January 1183) became entitled to the Temporalities of the See. It is singular that the See should have been at ferm before the death of Bishop Peche ; but it was so undoubtedly, for Noel paid the same Bishop, before his death, 40s. out of the revenues of the See, in respect of a daily allowance ordered by writ of the King. This, by the way, con- 34 Rot. Pip. 8, 9, 10 Ric. I. 35 Rot. Pip. 29 Hen. II. Episcopatus Cestrie. There may be a doubt whether I rightly limit the three-quarters of a year, for which Noel accounts. I understand him to have fermed the See from the re tirement of Bishop Peche till his death (which certainly took place on Oct. 6,"], [162, "132 ALVELEY. the same See, once more in the King's hands, and, with another associate, continued in this trust till Christmas 1184.36 Also in 1185, he appears as one of the Fermors of the vacant Abbey of Chester.37 From Michaelmas 1184 to Michaelmas 1189, he was Sheriff of Staffordshire, and accounted for the five years thus indicated.38 At Michaelmas 1187, Thomas Noel and his Associates had acted as Justices in Eyre in Staffordshire, and at the following Michael mas their visit had extended to Shropshire.39 There are other indications of Noel's concern in Shropshire affairs about this time, and previous to the establishment of his wife's coheirship. After that event, the first notice of him and his said wife is in January 1197, when by Fine, levied at Westminster, they conveyed their third of Knockin to John le Strange, receiving in return all said John's lands of Myxle and Bradehape (Mixen and Braden hope, Staffordshire) . The further particulars of this Fine shall be given under Knockin. The partition of Ralph le Strange's estate and effects seems to have been matter of some dispute among the Coheirs themselves. \u2014 On Jan. 20, 1199, a day is given to Thomas Noel, Richard de Wappenburi, and Griffin and Matilda his wife, to receive their chyrograph.40 On May 9, 1199, Thomas Noel is found defendant in a plea of Chattels which Griffun Walensis (doubtless Griffin son of Gervase Goch) was prosecuting against him.41 In another Essoign Roll of June 17, 1199, I find mention of a suit then pending at Westminster, where Griffun, son of Hereward Cogh, as he is called, stood against Thomas Noel and Richard de Wapenbiri.43 This suit, being adjourned, appears by an entry on firms the story of Bishop Peche having retired to St. Thomas's Priory, at Stafford, before his end. 36 Rot.

The interval between Feb. 2, 1184, and Christmas 1184, nearly repre sents the interval between Bishop Gerard la Pucelle's death (13 Jan. 1184) and Bishop Novant's election, which took place probably in January 1185. 37 Madox's Exchequer, p. 212, z. 38 Shaw (Appendix to General History, p. xxxiv) makes him Sheriff from 26 Hen.

At Michaelmas 1199, Thomas Noel had fined five merks not to cross the seas, \u2014 a fine which covered his assessment to the first scutage of King John. He had also proffered the large sum of 200 merks, that he might \" freely and without hindrance marry his daughters, Johanna and Alice, to whom he would.\" 44 This proffer, as will presently appear, was not accepted. Another evidence of his declining years is probably contained in the King's Charter, dated Nov. 19, 1200, which exempts him for life from serving as \" a Recognizor on any Recognition.\" 45 About March 1201, Thomas Noel fined at the rate of 300 merks and three palfreys with the Crown for license to marry his youngest daughter (Joan) to Thomas Fitz Eustace Fitz Stephen. This fine was accepted; Geoffrey Fitz Piers being ordered to take security for its payment. Noel, in addition, promised to give the King \" a better Goshawk (austurcum) than Geoffrey Fitz Piers had.\" At the same time, William de Harcourt fined separately in a sum of 100 merks for having to wife the elder daughter of the said Thomas.46 The Pipe Rolls of Michaelmas 1201 and following years show a redistribution of the liabilities incurred under these Fines. Thomas Fitz Eustace is charged (under Lincolnshire) with 200 merks and a Goshawk ; William de Harcourt is charged (under Warwickshire and Leicestershire) with 100 merks; and Thomas Noel is charged (under Shropshire) with 100 merks and three palfreys, \u2014 a debt which he continued to liquidate in this and the following years. At the same time (Michaelmas 1201), his former proffer of 200 merks being recorded against Thomas Noel, Geoffrey Fitz Piers certified the Barons of Exchequer that Noel's first fine was included in his later one of 300 merks, and so intimated that no proceedings should be taken for the recovery thereof. Thomas Noel seems to have died in 1206 ; for in the end of that year or beginning of 1207, Thomas de Blancminster gives the King 100 merks and two palfreys, that he may have to wife Margaret le Strange, formerly wife of Thomas Noel, together with her inhe ritance and marriage portion, and reasonable share (of her former 45 Rot.

His Sureties in this matter were Thomas de Muleton, in twenty merks, and Reginald de Blancminster, also in twenty merks.47 Thomas de Blancminster, otherwise called Thomas de Albo Monasterio, does not appear to me to have been connected with Shropshire except by his marriage. If Reginald de Blancminster just now mentioned were his relation, I should look to distant Counties for some trace of his origin, viz., to Berkshire, Oxford shire, or Devonshire. Our immediate concern is to state that in 1211, Thomas de Albo Monasterio and Griffin de Sutton, Knights, are found holding Weston in capite by Knight's service, viz., half a Knight's-Fee, and also holding Alvitheleg, a Manor of Royal Demesne, by service of another half-fee.48 Thomas de Blancminster had a grant of escheated lands in Essex and Hertfordshire from King John, dated AprU 1, 1216.49 On April 18, 1217, as Thomas de Albo Monasterio, he has letters of safe conduct from Henry III.50 He occurs in Somersetshire, August 11, 1217 ;51 and in the foUowing year apparently, by the wiU and consent of Margery le Strange his wife, enfeoffed Henry de Audley in the Manors of Mixne and Bradenhope, to hold to him and his heirs of the Grantor and his heirs \u2014 rendering therefore yearly, on the vigil of Easter, a pair of white gloves to him or his servant at Alveley. Thomas and his heirs would warrant the premises to the Grantee against all men. Also Margaret aforesaid, by her separate but contemporary Deed, granted the same feoffment, \u2014 \" to bold to the Grantee and his heirs,of her and her heirs, according to the tenorof the first charter.\"52 It is probable that Thomas de Blancminster survived his wife Margaret le Strange , \u2014 at least such a person occurs in Essex after her death. That he had no surviving issue by her is evident on two grounds : \u2014 first, because her daughters by Thomas Noel were her sole heirs ; secondly, because Thomas de Blancminster held nothing of her estate after her decease. 47 Rot.

But on the 15th of April next following, the King's writ enjoins the same Sheriff to take security from Alice de Harecurt and Johanna her Sister, daughters and heirs of Margery le Strange, for 100s., \u2014 their relief of half a Knight's fee which said Margery held of the King in capite in Alvithele and Westun, and then to give them instant seizin?3 Again on June 26, 1222, the King informs the Sheriff of War wickshire of the Fine by which these Coheiresses, with their husbands, William de Harcourt and Thomas Fitz Eustace, had obtained their relief, and enjoins him to give them seizin of the land of Granborough, which was of their inheritance, but had been held in dower by their Mother.64 In continuation of my account of Ralph le Strange's Coheirs, I shall hardly be expected to revert to the early History of \u2014 William de Harcourt, whose fortunes and possessions con nected him with other Counties rather than Shropshire, and the particulars of whose career may be learnt from other sources.55 A steady and well-rewarded adherent of King John, he was in office as Seneschal of that King at the close of his reign. He joined the Crusade of 1218, and in October 1220 was still absent from England. In the year following that in which he had livery of his wife's inheritance, viz., on April 6, 1223, he was deceased. By his wife Alice, who survived him, he had two sons, Richard and Henry. The former was his heir, and if not of age at his Father's death, was so within a year after. Alice de Harcourt was surviving her husband in October 1227, when she, with her Sister (called Johanna Noel) and their Aunt (called Matilda le Estrange), were returned as holding the Manor of Alvitheleg of the King, the value of which was \u00a36. per annum?6 But at Michaelmas 1235, Alice de Harcourt was dead, for the Scutage then in course of collection (on the marriage of the King's Sister) was levied on Richard de Harcourt (her eldest son), Matilda le Strange (her Aunt), and Johanna Noel (her Sister), in respect of 53 Rot.

The real Successor to Alice de Harcourt was her second son, \u2014 Henry de Harcourt, to whom in her lifetime she gave her share of the Manor. This share, estimated at a quarter of a hide, was, in 1255, held by the said Henry, but afterwards he set it to farm to Leo de Romesley, whose Tenure, commencing after the siege of Kenilworth (1266), was still unexpired in November 1274. Meanwhile, Henry de Harcourt was deceased, leaving his son and heir, another Henry, under age.58 Henry de Harcourt (II) was, in 1284, in possession of his share of Alveley, which is stated to be one-sixth of a Knight's fee, held by him of the heir of William de Harcourt, and by the said heir of the King in capite?9 At the Assizes of 1292, no mention is made of Harcourt's share in Alveley, though Henry de Harcourt is said to have been still living.60 I conclude it to have been the share then held by Simon de Alveley, but under whom Simon held it I cannot say. I must now give some account of the succession of \u2014 Joan or Juliana Noel, youngest daughter and coheir of Thomas Noel, and wife of Thomas Fitz Eustace Fitz Stephen.61 Her husband, living, as we have already seen, in June 1222, was deceased Feb. 22, 1223, when the Sheriffs of Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire were apprized that his son and heir Thomas had fined ten merks for his relief, and was to have seizin of such lands as his Father had held in capite.62 Joan Noel, his Mother, 67 Testa de Nevill, pp. 61, 60. wickshire)\\ms namedThomasFitz Eustace only as her husband. Baker (History of Northamptonshire) has endeavoured to combine the two statements, by making Fitz Eustace her first and Duston her se cond husband,- \u2014 an unfortunate compro mise, for it happens that the first thus alleged husband survived the last. \u2014 53 Rot.Bund.

The heir of William de Harcourt was Richard, already men tioned (Vol. II, 223, 233, 236), and who was now of age. The truth is that Duston was never Joan Noel's husband at all, and the rea son why he has been put down as suchjs^ that he had a great Charter of Feoffment from Thomas Noel, Joan's Father, not however as a Son-in-Law, but only as a Feoffee. 60 Collins (Peerage,^ 'ol. V, edition 1779, p. 264) says he died in 1293, and adds some further particulars of his succession. 61 Erdeswick (Survey of Staffordshire) mentions William de Duston as the hus band of Joan Noel, and as the Progenitor of her heirs.

Hence in 1255, we find Ralph Noel holding a quarter of a hide in Alveley, or a third part of that estate there, which the Record represents as divided among three Coheirs only, and constituting half a Knight's fee. After this, Ralph Noel sold both his share of Alveley and his interest in Badger to William de Hempton, of whom I have already spoken in connection with the latter Manor.63 The time of this sale I cannot determine, but previous to January 1256, WUliam de Hemptou had a minor interest in Alveley. \u2014 At the Assizes then held, he sued WUliam de la Grene, Chaplain, and Nicholas his Brother, for disseizing him of four acres there. The case was a curious one. \u2014 William de la Grene pleaded that he had not disseized Hempton unjustly, inasmuch as he, Wilbam de la Grene, had been enfeoffed in three acres by one Henry Fitz WiUiam of Alveley. To this Hempton replied, acknowledging that Henry Fitz William had given the alleged Charter of feoffment, but that he bad given it at a time when a term of twenty years, for which he had previously demised the premises to one Henry de Pirie, was still current, so that Grene took no seizin under the said Charter ; \u2014 that during the said term Henry de Pirie died, bequeathing the residue thereof to his widow, who subsequently married Henry de Morf; \u2014 that, the term stUl running, Henry Fitz William granted a second Charter of Feoffment to the present Plaintiff (Hempton) on condition that he should satisfy Henry de Morf for the residue of his term ; \u2014 that the Plaintiff did so, and thus had entry on the premises. After reference to a Jury the Plaintiff recovered the premises, and Grene was in misericordid?* In November 1274, William de Hempton was holding the share of Alveley which he had purchased from Ralph Noel. He was also second of the Jurors who then reported on the state of Stottesden Hundred.65 Doubtless it was his son who, written as William de Eynton, was returned in 1284 as holding one-sixth of a Knight's fee in Alveley of the heir of Ralph Noel, which heir is also said to hold the same of the King in capite?6 At the Assizes of October 1292, the Jurors of the Liberty of Nordley made very inaccurate presentments as to the tenure of 63 Rot.

Alveley.67 They said, for instance, that it was a member of Nordley, and included in the fee-farm tenure of that Manor. They also said contradictorily, but still not truly, that Henry de Morf, with IsabeUa his wife, Simon de Alvytheleg, and WiUiam de Hempton, held Alveley in capite. As to Hempton's share, it appeared that Johanna, Widow of WiUiam de Hempton, had custody of her son William, then a Minor. She not coming forward in Court, the Sheriff was ordered to seize the said share; but afterwards Johanna appeared, and showed that her tenure was not in capite, but under Ralph Noel and his heirs ; that the Grandfather of her Infant Son, and Father of her late husband, purchased the said share from Ralph Noel, to hold of the said Ralph, not of the King. She appealed to a Jury for verification of this statement, which was doubtless correct, but I do not find the result. Thus Wilbam de Hampton, a Minor in 1292, was the third of his name who had possessed a share of Alveley. Leaving to a note a curious reminiscence which we still have of the Hamptons' interest in this neighbourhood,68 I must now recur to the history of the other Sisters and Coheirs of Ralph le Strange. \u2014 Joan le Strange, apparently the second of these, was, as we have seen, wife of Richard de Wappenbury. This Richard held the Manor, from which he took his name and other great estates in Warwickshire. His Tenure, which he inherited from Thomas his Father, constituted no less than five fees of old feoffment, held under the Barony of Mowbray. I refer elsewhere for a fuller account of this family,69 from which I only extract that a Fine was levied in 10 John (1208-9), whereby Richard de Wappenbury was bound to do no injury to the 67 Placita Coron\u00e6, 20 Edw. I, m. 82. Hampton'sLoad was therefore originally a Ford of the Severn connecting Chel marsh with Quat and Alveley ; and it will in some way have been associated with this family of Hamptons, viz. first pointed out, or made passable, or much used by one or other of them. 6S Hampton's Load, alias Hempton's Load, took its name from a person rather than a place ; i.e. from one of these Hamp tons rather than from the adjacent vill of Hampton, in Chelmarsh Manor, from which however they doubtless came. Hampton's Load, I should observe, is not equivalent to Hampton's-Wharf, for, to whatever language it may belong, the word Load or Lode often indicates a Ford. One William de Hempton-Ford (dis tinct from any William de Hempton) is mentioned by the same Nordley Jurors whose presentments I have been quoting above. I have noticed tins before, in the case of a small rivulet (Supra, Vol. II, p. 221, 69 Dugdale's Warwickshire, I, 294 note 76). (Thomas) ."], [169, "139 ALVELEY. inheritance of Thomas his son and heir ; \u2014 also that Richard was living in 1209, but dead before the end of King John's reign (1216), when his said son, Thomas, was in rebellion. Now, though it is quite clear, that in the first instance, Richard de Wappenbury had a share in each of Le Strange's Manors, it does not appear that anything at Alveley or Weston descended to his Son. Both Manors were, at aU periods subsequent to the life of Richard de Wappenbury, held by Margaret and Matilda le Strange, their heirs or Assignees. This may have been the result of a surrender or a sale, or it may have been that Thomas, son of Richard de Wappenbury, was not the son of Joan le Strange, and that the latter died issueless. I have no evidence on the point further than is supplied by those sections of the Sheriff's annual accounts which treat of the Corpus Comitatus and of Scutages. And this evidence is not to be altogether trusted ; \u2014 but, as the degree in which it may be trusted becomes very apparent in relation to Alveley, I shall take this opportunity of entering fully into the matter. And first of the Corpus Comitatus. \u2014 From 1196 to 1207 in clusive, the Sheriff attributes Alveley, or 110 solidates of land there, correctly; \u2014 to Thomas Noel, Richard de Wapenburi, and Griffin de Sutton. From 1208 to 1212 inclusive, he, no less correctly, substitutes Margaret le Strange's name for that of her deceased husband, Thomas Noel. But from 1213 to 1215, Thomas Noel is made to occupy his old place on the list. In 1218, the three alleged Coparcners are Thomas de Blanc minster, Griffin son of Gervase, and Richard de Wapenburi, the last with manifest incorrectness. And this entry, becoming still more inaccurate on the death of Griffin in Jan. 1221, is never theless continued tUl Christmas 1223. Then Alice de Harcourt and Johanna her Sister are set down as Coparcners in Alveley, excluding all mention of their Aunt Matilda, who was still living. And though Alice was deceased in 1235, and Johanna somewhat later, yet this entry is continued till the first year of Edward I (1273) ; after which I have not consulted these Rolls on the matter. Nor do the Records of Scutages satisfy us on many points of genealogy and date, nor yet on the specific liability of Alveley to these assessments. For instance ; \u2014 Guy le Strange is charged on one-and-a-half fees to each of King Richard's three Scutages, \u2014 a rate which must have included both Weston and something else besides Alveley, but that something does not appear. More-"], [170, "140 ALVELEY. over, Guy le Strange was deceased before the accession of King Richard. Again, Richard de Wapenburi and Thomas Noel seem to have been charged with the five first Scutages of John; Griffin de Sutton with the fourth, fifth, and sixth ; and Griffin again, with Richard de Wappenbury with the seventh, where the death of Thomas Noel is perhaps accurately marked ; but in five out of these seven Scutages the name of one coheir at least is omitted, and the rates at which they were laid were so unequal, that it is evident they included fines for neglect of personal service. To the Scutages of 1214 and 1218, Thomas de Blancminster and Griffin de Sutton were assessed on half a fee in Alveley with partial correctness (for, as I elsewhere suggest, Richard de Wappenbury's interest here had lapsed to a purchaser or to the other coheirs), but why Weston was now exempted from Scutage I cannot surmise. The Scutage of Biham in 1221 does not include any of the names of these Cohens, but the two Scutages of 1224 are assessed on the \" Heirs of Guy le Strange for one whole fee in Alveley and Weston.\" The four Scutages of 1227, 1228, 1229, and 1230, are assessed on Alice de Harcourt and Johanna her Sister for hah0 a fee in Alveley, \u2014 correctly as regarded the sum charged, for they had sold Weston, but incorrectly as regards the non-mention of Griffin de Sutton. The Scutage, or rather Aid, assessed at Michaelmas 1235 and Easter 1236 has been already quoted70 as charged on Richard de Harcourt, Matilda le Strange, and Joan Noel, and on half a fee in Alveley. This is quite correct, but then this Scutage is not recorded on the Pipe Rolls. Lastly, the Scutages of 1245, 1254, and 1260, were assessed as on half a fee, held by Alice de Harcourt and Johanna her Sister ; where the sums charged are clearly for Alveley, but where the omission of Madoc de Sutton and the mention of two Ladies, one certainly and the other probably deceased before the earliest of these three Scutages, are all inaccurate. Thus cautioned as to how far we may accept the evidence of Scutage Rolls, we leave these fiscal anomalies, ano! revert to the history and succession of the third Sister and Coheir of Ralph le Strange, so far as we have not afready spoken of her under Sutton- Maddock. Matilda le Strange was wife of Griffin de Sutton, who died 70 Supra, p. 136."], [171, "141 ALVELEY. about January 1221. 71 She survived till 1242. Unlike her hus band, who desired to be buried at Wombridge, she made a grant to Haughmond Abbey, indicative of her preference for the House which had been benefited by her Father, Brother, and other Relations. She gave the Canons, together with her body, a third, probably her share, of a MU1 at Stretton-super-Dunsmore, together with a third of a fishery, and of land pertaining to tbe same Mill.72 Her elder son, Madoc de Sutton, succeeded her at Alveley. Howell, one of her younger sons, seems also to have been resident there ; for a rent which the Prior of Wombridge was to pay him for a parcel of land at Uppington was to be so paid at Alveley.73 In 1255, Sir Madoc de Sutton, Knight, was found to hold a quarter of a hide in Alveley, equal, I suppose, to a third of the Manor after the alienations by Ralph le Strange, to Haughmond Abbey and Bridgnorth Hospital. Sir Madoc de Sutton gave his share of Alveley with Isabel his daughter in frank-marriage to Henry de Morf, who were both living, and seized thereof, in November 1274.74 In 1284 again, Henry de Morf is said to hold one-sixth of a Knight's-fee in Alveley of the heirs of Madoc de Sutton, who are also said to hold the same of the King in capite.75 71 InNovember 1221, the Nordley Jurors presented Matilda's Widowhood, and how she was in the King's gift. They valued her estate in their Franchise at 40s. per annum. The Brimstree Jurors, as I have before stated, put her estate of inheritance at \u00a3_. per annum, and her dower at 40s. (Vol. n, pp. 115, 116.) Perhaps the \u00a34. of inheritance was from Badger only, and not from Alveley, as before stated ; \u2014 for Alveley was rather in Stottesden than in Brimstree Hundred. vived his Father more than fifty years. In September 1272, he, with Margery and Hugh de Dunfowe, were sued by William Howel and Nesta his wife, for disseizing them of a messuage and half-virgate in Alveley. It was shown that Margery held nothing in Alveley, and that what Hugh held was by feoffment of Howel. So the case failed on a technical want of form. (Assize Roll, 56 Hen. Ill, 10 dorso.) 74 Rot.

Nevertheless this Isabel cannot have been the daughter of Madoc de Sutton, men tioned above, for Henry de Morf, husband of the latter Isabel, was living long after. Probably she was that Widow of Henry de Pirie who remarried to a previous Henry de Morf, as before indicated (p. 137). 72 Chartulary, so. 211.

In October 1292, Henry de Morf and Isabella his wife, having first been presented by the Nordley Jurors as tenants in capite,76 were impleaded by the Crown under writ of right for their third of the Manor of Alvitheleye. The King's Prosecutor alleged the former Seizin of Henry II, and deduced the title of Edward I in the usual form. The Defendants appeared and put themselves on a Jury of the Country in lieu of the King's Great Assize, which Jury should say who had the better right to the premises, they or the King. The Jury found for the Defendants, in right of Isabella.77 Henry de Morf, of whom we have been speaking, was Lord of Morf, a Manor and vill in the adjoining part of Staffordshire, which he held under the Barons of Bermingham, whose tenure again was under the greater Barony of Dudley. Henry de Morf seems to have died soon after 1296. His wife Isabella, who sur vived him, was also deceased on Jan. 28, 1302, when an Inquest was ordered to be taken as on the death of a Tenant in capite. The Jury found her to have so held by service of a sixth part of a Knight's fee. Her demesne consisted of a messuage and thirty-two acres of arable and meadow land. Her rents were 19*. Id., and the whole value of her tenure was \u00a31. 12s. lid. Henry de Morf, her son and heir, was forty-five years of age.78 The King forth with accepted his homage.79 I find Henry de Morf, thus succeeding, attesting an Enville Deed of 1303, and also a Charter in 1317, whereby Sir William de Ber mingham grants to William de Morf (brother of Henry), and to his six children in remainder, a parcel of Morf-bosc.80 The Feodary of 1316 gives Henry de Morf as Lord of Morf, but puts down Simon de Alvitheley as sole Lord of Alveley.81 I shall attempt no more systematic notice of the Under-Tenants of Alveley than to arrange in chronological order the various names which occur in that relation, probable or apparent. (I should mention that a Manorial Court, like that noticed under Claverley, exempted Alveley from other Hundredal Jurisdiction, but whereas this Court was common to the neighbouring Manor of Nordley Regis I will speak more particularly thereof under the latter.)

In Hilary and Easter Terms 1199, a plea of land which Richard de Wappen buri had against Simon de Alvitheleg was twice mentioned, and was the subject of still further adjournment. At Lichfield Assizes in the Autumn of the same year, Simon de Alvitheleg was fined half a merk for not producing one for whom he was Surety. In a suit of 1203, Richard de Alvitheleg was Attorney for Thomas Noel. In 1249, Justices are appointed to take recognition whether cer tain land in Alveley belonged to the Church thereof, or was the lay fee of William de Pery and Isabel his wife; also to try an assize of Mort d'Ancestre which Hamo Fitz William had against Laurence de Alveley and William de Perye concerning land in Alveley.83 The latter Suit, as we learn from another Record, re lated to a noke of land and 3s. rent, which Hamo Fitz WiUiam asserted that his Uncle, John Gernun, had died seized of, and which he claimed as his heir. Laurence de Alveley replied by questioning the legitimacy of Hamo Fitz William, and the usual reference ou that point had been made to the Diocesan Court of Hereford, when, in Hilary Term 1250, the King ordered that the Suit in its then state should be transferred to the Courts at West minster.83 I can say nothing of its result. On the Jury, which in 1255 reported the state of this Manor, were William de Cleacre and Thomas de Pira. They both officiated at the Assizes of 1256, the latter under the name of Thomas de Pyrie. In August 1257, Katherine de Cherlecote (already mentioned under Charlcott and Bold84) had a suit of novel disseizin against John Fitz Philip and others concerning a tenement in Alveley.85 At the Assizes of 1272, William Howel and John le Clokere were on the Manorial Jury.

In 1292, the Nordley Jurors presented Simon de Alvytheleg as Tenant in capite of a third of Alveley. He gave the King half a merk that all inquiry should be adjourned from the Assizes to the next Parliament, so that I cannot tell whether the Jurors were right or not. If they were, then Simon or his Predecessor had bought Harcourt's share of the Manor, \u2014 to hold, not of Harcourt, but of the Lord of the Fee.

That King granted a hide here to one whose name is variously written \" Fitz Ulky\" and \" Fulky.\" The grant was in fee-farm,2 and the Tenant was to pay \u00a38. 10s. annually for the same at the Exche quer. The descendants of Fitz Ulky afterwards took a name from the vill of Astley, which at Domesday was Manorially a member of an undated Deed ; also John de Swynlo, or Sweneleigh, as made Custos of the Free Chapel of St. Anne of Alvidelee, on Aug. 18, 1361 (Vide Newcourfs Repertory, 1, 1G7) ; also Bichard Felde as Parson of Alveley in 1391.\u2014 Shropshire, unique. Its consequences in respect of fiscal routine are worth observ ing. The Sheriff never accounts for the fee-farm rent of Nordley, as he does where Manors were granted in fee-farm after the accession of Henry II. Nor was Nordley estimated to constitute a part of the annual Bevenue described by the terms Firma Comitatus and Corpus Comitatus. The Manors which, on Henry II's revival of the Exchequer, were classed in that ac count, were evidently those only, which, having been ancient demesne, had so con tinued till the death of Henry I. The Deed justifying the first of these three entries I have found among the muniments at Pitchford. Its date must he about 1233. Bichard de la Feld was presented to a portion of Burford in 1385. 1 Domesday, so. 248, a. 1.

Of that however hereafter. The Son and heir of Fitz Ulky was named Robert. He also ap pears to have lived in the time of Henry I, and according to one Record3 was the original Feoffee of that King. The authority which I follow is however the more ancient and the more weighty.4 Robert was succeeded by his son and heir Osbert, who lived in the time of Henry II, and was called Osbert de Astley. Thus, at Michaelmas 1167, 1 find that Osbert de Estlega had been fined one merk by the Justice of the Forest, and in 1188, Osbert de Eselega had been Visor of certain repairs done to the King's Chamber at Kinver.6 Osbert was succeeded by his son, a second Robert, who seems to have been surnamed \"The Knight\" (Le Knit), I suppose with re ference to his Serjeantry. At the County Assizes of October 1203, I find this Robert de Estleia, as he is here written, essoigning his attendance under the common summons. His Essoignor was Roger de Fililod, a near neighbour. Robert de Astley died before the year 1211, leaving John, his son, under age ; \u2014 whose wardship appears to have been granted by King John to Thomas de Erdinton. In November 1228, John de Estleg appeared in the Courts at Westminster to give answer to the King as to the Warrant he had for holding one hide in Nordley. The Defendant recited the facts above stated, and how his four ancestors had regularly paid the fee farm rent, under which they held the land, to the King's Ancestors. A search being thereupon made at the Exchequer, an Inquisition was found, stating this ancient tenure, but giving no account as to how John de Astley's ancestors had ingress at Nordley, nor under what warranty they held. The King soon afterwards, sitting himself in Court or in Coun- . cil, ordered the Defendant to be dismissed sine die, as the King had no present intention of pursuing the cause ; but, at the same time, the King's right to renew the same in future, if he chose, was reserved.6 3 Rot.

They had left John de Estleg and others responsible for a debt of \u00a33. 18s. 4d., charged on certain parcels of corn-land which had been assarted in the Manor of Northleg, and which ap parently were encroachments on the Forest of Morf. Of this debt, \u00a32. had been since paid by John de Nortleg, as he is called.7 Before April 3, 1235, John de Estleg was deceased, and John Fitz Philip (of Quat and Bobbington) had fined ten merks to have custody of his lands and heirs, with the marriage of the latter. The Sheriff of Shropshire was ordered to give John Fitz Philip seizin accordingly.8 In 1255, the Jurors who returned the state of the united Manors of Nordley and Alveley said, in reply to a question as to \"who held lands within Manors of Crown Demesne,\" that, \" Nordleg and Alve ley were once of the King's Demesne ; that John, son of John de Estleg, then held Nordleg at fee-farm, by Charter, of the King; that this had been so for a long time; that he paid \u00a38. 10s. yearly; that Nordleg contained one hide ; and that Robert, father of Osbert, was the original Feoffee, by grant of Henry I, and that John, now seized, was his hereditary successor.\"9 In February 1262, John, son of John de Estleg, is charged under the Regard of Morf and Shirlet Forests for imbladements.10 In 1268, John de Astley (II) was involved in a curious litigation with one of his Tenants here. Reginald de Molendino (otherwise called Reginald Syer) sued him in his own Manorial Court for two Mills, under a Writ Close de Recto.11 Reginald had stated his complaint to the said Court, and John had made answer questioning the petitioner's story. And because the Court had thus allowed John to make answer, Reginald, conceiving himself aggrieved, had gone to the King's Court, and sued out a Writ directed to the Sheriff of Shropshire, enjoining the said Sheriff to take with him four Kuights, and go to the said Manor Court and see that justice be done between the parties. The Sheriff had hereupon ordered John de Astley to summon his Court for Wednesday, July 22, 1268, when the Sheriff proposed to be there. It does not appear 7 Rot. Pip. 15 Hen.

The Sheriff had now orders to go with four Knights to the Court of Astleg and Norleg, and make record of the proceedings which had taken place in that Court under the King's original Writ, \" because John de Astley now complains that a false judgment has been given against him in the said Court.\" The Sheriff is to produce in the King's Court the said Record under his Seal, and also is to have in the King's Court, four members of the Manor Court who were present on the occasion when such judgment was given. A Jury was also to be summoned to the King's Court to hear this Record read, and, as I suppose, to decide the appeal.13 I find nothing more of this matter except that, lower down on the Plea Roll, John de Astleg is stated to acknowledge himself as a debtor to Ralph de Hengham, Clerk, in the sum of \u00a35. How this could arise from the Suit I cannot determine. At the Inquisitions of November 1274, the tenure of Northley was not only alluded to by the Jurors of Brug, but made a subject of detailed statement by the Jurors of the Manor itself. They gave no addition to facts already stated, except that we conclude from their account that the John de Astley then seized was the same as he who was a Minor in 1235.14 Before the 11th of February 1275, he was deceased, for such is the date of the King's writ of diem clausit extremum which issued on that occasion. The Jury, which sat at Estleg on February 21, found that he had held one carrucate in Northleye and one carrucate in Estleg ; that his capital messuage stood half in Northleye and half in Estleg; that the King received \u00a313. 10s. per annum for the two tenures ; that John, eldest son and heir of the deceased, would be seventeen years of age on June 24 following. The Manors, said these Jurors, ought to be subject to the Tallages of the King.15 This right of the Crown we have however seen to have been disused for sixty years prevoiusly.16 12 Pat. 54 Hen.

John de Astley, thus succeeding, is entered on the Feodary of 1284, as Tenant in capite of Northleye, in Stottesden Hundred.17 In 1292, he was sued by the Crown for this Manor under writ of right. Hugh de Louther stated the former seizin of Henry II (not Henry I) in this Manor, and so deduced the reigning King's Title. The Defendant does not seem to have availed himself of this palpable error, but appealed to a Jury on the general issue as to whose right was the better, his or the King's. The said Jury found John de Est legh's existing Tenure to be valid, and the King's claim unfounded.18 Some minor points, mooted by the Stottesden Jurors at the cotemporary Assizes, seem not to have been pressed. They had reported John de Astle as claiming free-warren in his demesne-lands of Northle, also a free Court, assize of bread and beer, and ways. The first he denied ; the last he justified by immemorial usage. I find John de Astleye foreman of a Jury at Alveley in 1302, and on a Jury at Bruges, May 15, 1306. A King's writ of February 24, 1310, orders a Jury to report what injury it would be to the Crown if the King allowed John de Astleye Senior to enfeoff John, son of John de Astleye, in the Manors of Astleye and Nordley, so that, seizin being had by the Feoffee, the latter should concede the premises to John de Astleye Senior for life. The Jury, which sat at Bruges on March 23 following, reported in favour of the license being granted. \u2014 \" John de Astleye Senior, after such feoffment had been given, would still have 40s. rent in Astleye.\" 19 In 4 Edw. II (1310-1) it appears that John de Astlei Senior fined \u00a310. with the King for the aforesaid license.20 The result is embodied in a Fine levied at Westminster on the Quinzaine of Easter 1312. Here John, son of John de Asteleye, is plaintiff, and John de Astleye Senior Deforciant of the Manors in question. John Senior acknowledges to have given them to John Junior, who concedes them to John Senior, to hold for life, of the King, with remainder to John Junior, to hold of the King ; and (it is added) \" this Concord was made by precept of the King.\" 31 By a deed of 9 Edward II (1315-6) John, son of John Lord (domini) of Astley, grants to Nicholas, son of Nicholas de la Grene 17 Kirby's Quest. His rent to the King is put (evidently by mistake) at \u00a38. 6*. 8d. of \u00a38. 10s. Its full value they said was \u00a310. 18 Placita de quo Waranto, p. 674.

The Inquest taken at Claverley on April 25 reports favourably of the proposal, adding that Northleye Manor was worth 20s. per annum more than the rent reserved to the Crown : also that John de Astleye would still have the Manor of Astleye of \u00a33. 6s. 8d. annual value.23 I think this John de Astley must have been identical with John de Astleye Junior, the Feoffee of John Senior in 1312. Roger may have been son and heir of John Junior, but if so, was very young. A Royal License followed the last Inquisition, enabling Roger de Astleye, for a fine of 40s., to acquire the Manor of Northleye from John de Astleye.24 Roger de Astley thus became Tenant in capite of Nordley. He died Sept. 30, 1362. His fee-farm rent of \u00a39. had been granted to him for life by the King. His tenure consisted of a messuage and carrucate in Nordley. When, on Feb. 26, 1363, the Inquest was taken on his death, his heir was his grandson Thomas, son of his deceased son Thomas, which grandson was then only three weeks old.25 Thomas de Astley died in infancy, viz., on June 11, 1376.

I have now to speak distinctively of Astley, which, though ori ginally a member of Nordley, and held by the same Tenants in ca pite, was a tenure, not in fee-farm, but by Serjeantry. Thus, in 1211, we hear that, \"John, son of Robert de Estleg, holds Estleg from ancient time, from the Conquest ; and he owes, of his service, one serving horseman with a hauberk, to accompany the Lord the King when he goes on any military expedition into Wales. The costs of the said horseman were to be paid by the King.\"27 At the Assizes of November 1221, the only Serjeantry reported of by the Stottesden Jurors as in their Hundred was thus men tioned :\u2014 \"Hugh Fitz Robert holds by Serjeantry of the Lord King, and by service that he shall be Custos of the King's Pavilion when the King goes into Wales ; and the Serjeantry is worth two merks ; and the said Hugh is under age, and in custody of his Mo ther, the Jurors know not by whose authority ; and she, Alice, is in the King's gift.\"28 Here I should observe, that the service of this Serjeantry, being different from that before stated, does not necessarily imply that Astley was not the place concerned. Serjeantries were often essen tially changed ; often too they were misrepresented by local Jurors. If then the Astley Serjeantry was intended to be here described, and I know of no other Serjeantry in Stottesden Hundred that could be thus alluded to, it is evident that the name of the Infant Tenant was John Fitz Robert, and not Hugh Fitz Robert. In 1255, the Jurors of Nordley and Alveley found that John, son of John de Estleg, was holding in the collective Manor half a hide in Estleg by Serjeantry of finding for the King one horseman for Wales in time of war, for forty days (the said horseman to be sup plied) with victuals.29 At the Assizes of Oct. 1272, the Jurors of the same Liberty said that \" John de Astle held half a hide in Astle by Serjeantry of finding one man-at-arms (armigerum), who, together with himself, should have guard over the * * *30 of the Lord the King to- 27 Testa de Nevill, pp. 55, 417 ; Liber Ruber, so. cxxxvii. 1221. \u2014 His name, I think, suggested the assumed mistake. 28 Assizes, 6 Hen.

ASTLEY. wards Wales for 40 days. The said John de Astleg is further re ported as a Defaulter in due attendance at these Assizes ; and the word obiit written over his name does not indicate, I think, that he was dead at the time of holding the Assize, but was added at least two years after, when perhaps his death interfered with some fur ther reckoning, consequent upon his default.31 In fact, as I have said before, he appears to have been living when, on Nov. 27, 1274, the Jurors of this Liberty reported his tenure of Nordley in fee-farm. Of Astley they added specifically, that \" the same John holds Estleg, within the said Liberty, of the King, in capite, by Serjeantry of going with the King into Wales, with his horse and arms, and with another horseman in his com pany, for forty days, at his own cost, and if he follow (the King) longer, then it shall be at the King's cost.\" 33 Again, as if we were never to understand the full nature of this tenure, the Inquest of 1284, describing the Serjeantry of John de Astley (III) says that it was \" by service of following vina Regi in time of war, towards Wales, for forty days at his own cost.\" 33 At the Assizes of 1292, the Jurors of the Liberty valued John de Estleg's Serjeantry in Estleg at 40s. They only specified the service to be that of one horseman &c, not the particular office of the said Guard. John de Astley was called upon to account for his due discharge of this service. He showed, that in the war of the King's fifth year (1277) he was under age, but in that of the tenth year (1282) he performed his service, and to prove this he called the Rolls of the King's Marshal to warranty. The matter was adjourned to the Quinzaine of Hilary, at Lichfield, but I can trace it no further.34 By Deed dated at Estleye, August 1, 1305, John Lord of Estleye gives to John Junior, son of Thomas Coc and Margery his wife, the land which John Senior, son of Thomas Coc, held of the Grantor in the field called Colverehusesfeld, bounded by the water-course of Fililodes-welle, and by the road which leads from Fililodes-welle to the Hall of Estleye : \u2014 to hold to John and Margery, and their heirs, at a penny rent, saving two Suits per annum at the Great Court of Northleye, held at Coten, upon reasonable summons beforehand.

On June 10, 1341, the King orders his Escheator to inquire by Inquest whether it would injure the King if he gave license to John de Astleye to enfeoff William de Fyllilod Junior and his heirs in one messuage, one carrucate of land, two acres of meadow, one acre of pasture, three acres of wood, and 40s. annual rent in Astleye and Northleye ; also to grant to the same William and his heirs the reversion of a Mill in Astleye, now held by Hugh de Solrugge and his wife Aveline for their lives, the reversion whereof at present pertained to John de Astleye ; so that said William, having seizin of the messuage &c., and having had attornment of the Mill from the tenants thereof, should be able to concede all to John de Astley for life, with remainder to himself (William) and to Dionisia his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, and in default of such heirs, to the right heirs of John de Astleye ? The Inquest held at Nordleye, on June 26 following, reported favourably of the proposed grant, and said that the premises were held by \" Great Serjeantry,\" viz., by providing one horseman for forty days in the army of Wales, at the Cost of the said John de Astleye, who, said the Jurors, had no other lands besides those which he now proposed to settle.36 I find from another Record, that William de Fililod Junior gave the King 100s. for allowing him to be thus enfeoffed in a tenure in capite.37 His descendants continued Lords of Astley for some generations. LIBERTY OF NORDLEY, ASTLEY, AND ALVELEY. I have shown, under Claverley, that the Manor of Nordley re mained assessable to the King's Tallages till the reign of John. How that reservation of Royal right came to be removed, I cannot declare. I should now say something of the Manorial Court which was common to Alveley, Nordley, and Astley, and had the jurisdiction usual to Manors of ancient demesne.

It is observable that they de scribe their own Franchise by the word \" Hundred.\" In 1255, the state of this Franchise was duly reported by six local Jurors and a Provost. Besides matters elsewhere treated of, they found the annual value of Nordley to be 30s. more than the Fee-farm rent reserved thereon. They stated that their Manor (Franchise) owed suit to neither County, Hundred, or other Court, except \" for death of man and for the common summons.\" 39 At the Assizes of 1256, this Franchise, called in one instance the Manor of Alwythel, in another the Manor of Northleg and Estleg, was represented in the usual way. So also at the Assizes of September 1272, and the Inquisitions of Hundreds in 1274. In the latter case, the Franchise is entitled the \" Liberty of Nortleg and Alvitleg.\" The said Liberty had these rights, viz., Gallows, Assize of Bread and Beer, and all other liberties which ordinarily belonged to the great tourn, i. e., to the greater Hundred-Courts held by the Sheriff. The Jurors complained of various infringe ments on the rights of members of their community, which had been perpetrated by the Sheriffs, by the Bailiffs of Hundreds, or by the Constable of Brug. Among others, Hugh de Donvil (he was Bailiff of Stottesden Hundred) had taken some land to farm in this Liberty, to the great annoyance and injury of the Freeholders, from whom he extorted certain dues which were not his right,40 but which I cannot explain, as they stand in the Record. The Bailiffs of Stottesden were also in the habit of entering unwarrantably upon the Liberty of Nordley, distraining the live stock of the Tenants, as well for ordinary debts as for debts due to the Crown, and causing the said stock to be driven to Brug Castle, whereas they had no right to drive it elsewhere than to Kingesbury, a place within the Franchise of Nordley.41 38 \" Northleg nil ; Manerium de Hales nil ; Claverleie nil ; Worfel nil, quia alibi hide sit dictum,\" \u2014 are the successive en tries on membrane 2, dorso, of the Roll. ble to the common summons, \u2014 such as issued previous to the general Assizes. \u25a0\"\u2022 \" Quia exigit ab eis ansilia sibi non pertinencia, videlicet arrur' et scm' et hu jusmodi per extorsionem.\" 39 Rot.

The cause in question was about a virgate of land in Northleg, which Christiana, daughter of Ralph Poer, claimed against Adam Tigg, the Tenant, who thus put himself on Grand Assize to try which party had the better right. A day was given to both Suitors and Recognizors, whenever the Justices should visit the County .43 In October 1203, this cause came on at Salop Assizes. Of nine teen Knights who appeared as Recognizors, or as deputing others to appear, not above six were identical with those named at the previous stage. Now the parties accorded, Christiana giving the King half a merk for license so to do, for which Thomas de Northleg and Adam Tugel (evidently the other Suitor) were her Sureties.44 At the Forest Assizes (March 1209) the following were assessed for imbladements, under the Account of Morf and Shirlet Forests, viz., Robert, Elias, and Roger de Northlegh, Edwin Fitz Orm, Adam Fitz Walter, and Christiana, Widow. At Shrewsbury Assizes (Nov. 1221) Alice, widow of Adam Tug, sued Arnulf Corvesar and his wife Christiana, for a third of thirty acres in Northleg, as her dower. The Defendants alleged that she had no right of dower in the premises, which belonged to Amelina, the former wife of Adam Tug, and Mother of the Defendant 42 Pedes Finium, 1 John, Salop. 43 Rot.

The Plaintiff (here called Matilda) rejoined that the premises were Adam's, not Amelina's, inheritance. The Sheriff was ordered to ascertain the truth by Inquisition of twelve Jurors. The result was reported in January, when the Justices were in eyre at War wick. The land was found to have been the right of Amelina, and not of Adam, so Arnulf gained the suit.45 In Michaelmas Term 1251, Emma, Widow of William Ernald, was suing William de Alvitheleg, Elyas le Mercer, and Roger Allemebie, for her dower in several small parcels of land in North leg. The Defendants pleaded that Ernald, having been con victed of larceny, had been hanged at Bromsgrove. This Emma denied, and appealed to a Jury. The Sheriff of Worcestershire, being ordered to summon such a Jury, made his report in Hilary Term following, viz., that the deceased had been hanged.46 Of the Jury of 1255, Robert the Provost, Robert de Bacworthin, Elyas de Herdewike, Stephen de la Grene, and Ralph de Screwor thin, perhaps belonged to Nordley and Astley, rather than to Al veley. Elias le Scot, William de Wolaston, Thomas de Fililode, Alditha a Widow, and Robert de Bacworthin, were then Tenants of small parcels of purpresture at Nordley, viz., in Morf Forest. In 1256, all the above Jurors officiated at the Assizes, except the second, instead of whom we have Roger Wodie. At these Assizes William son of William Wylinde with Sibil his wife, sued Richard son of Richard Onyet, for disseizing them of a tenement in Estleye. The cause does not seem to have been gone into.47 At the Forest Assizes of 1262, Roger de Perer and Elias le Scot are charged with imbladements at Northleg. At Salop, in August 1267, William le Schymusser, being charged with having disseized William Chicpnol and Sibil his wife of a messuage and twelve acres in Astley, pleaded that he purchased the premises, and had a verdict in his favour.48 At the Assizes of 1272, William le Franceys, William de Hord wych, Richard Carpenter, and Roger Saer, attended with Robert, their Provost, for this Manor. At these Assizes Sibil, widow of Richard son of Richard Onyet, sued William le Skirmesur for her dower, viz., one-third of a 45 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen. Ill, m. 7 dorso. 46 Placita apud Westm. Mich.

The following had various complaints against the King's Officers and Bailiffs elsewhere, viz., Roger Syer, John Atwood of Estleg, Roger ad Molendinum, Richard atte Tuene of Estleg, William Chaplain of Coton, Osbert Eluret, and Roger Baldwin.50 An Astley Jury, in February 1275, was attended by William de la Tune, John de Bosco, Roger Cier, and Elias Barat. The Jury at the Assizes of 1292 was headed by Giles de Astlegh, Chief Bailiff, and included Roger de Fylilod, Nicholas de la Grene, Walter de Kemeseye, Roger Baldewyne, and Adam Barat. Among their presentments was one as to the manslaughter of Robert Hobald, Uncle of Benedict de Burwarton. The latter was appellant in the matter.51 About this time I should place the Deed whereby Godith, daughter of Robert Wodere of Nordley, grants to Aldith, daughter of Stephen de la Grene, part of her land of assart for 4s.

The Defendants appeared not. The Jurors found that the land had belonged to Robert del Mulne, who enfeoffed Lee therein on July 30, 1292, and that Roger, son of Nicholas Fayrchild, had sued Robert del Mulne for the premises before the Justices who were in eyre at Shrewsbury in October 1292, and had recovered through default of said Robert, which of course was informal, as Lee was Tenant at the time ; and the Jurors believed that Roger, son of Nicholas, sued out his writ after the feoffment of Lee. To make sure as to this point, the Court ordered Lee to certify at Brug, on Saturday after Michael mas (1294), the date of the writ. He did so, proving the writ to be of date Sept. 5, 1292.

He is to hold the premises under the Chief Lords of the Fees. He paid 100 merks to the Recognizors.56 Bo-Mincjtoiu This Manor was, at Domesday, in the Staffordshire Hundred of Saisdone, where, in great part, it still remains. I am induced to treat of it however for several reasons \u2014 first, because a part of it is now in Shropshire, and because, parochially, it is a Member of Claverley ; secondly, because its ancient Lords were of a Shropshire family, and what I say of them here will save space elsewhere; lastly, because I have something to add to that which the Stafford shire Historians have already told us about Bobbington. \" The same Robert (de Stafford) holds in Bubintone v hides, and Helgot of him.

Castle Holgate it was who held it under the Barons of Stafford ; and the same person, written either as \u00c6lgot or Helgot, also held Estone (Aston) and Bernulvestone (Barlaston), both in Pireholle Hundred, under the said Barons ; and Metford (now Meaford) under Earl Roger de Montgomery. Nothing of this Staffordshire Tenure of Helgot remained with his principal heirs, the Barons of Holgate ; but whatever thereof continued in his family was the portion of a younger branch. Philip Fitz Helgot, as he was called, occurs as early as 1165, and lived till 1213. He was therefore nothing nearer than a Grandson or Great -Grandson of Helgot' s, and the intermediate link or links in the succession are perhaps lost. The Tenure of Philip Fitz Elgod under Robert de Stafford is marked in 1165, as consisting of one fee and a third part of a fee, both of which he held in Demesne.2 In 1167, his Manor of Barlaston, entered on the Pipe Roll as \" Berleston Philippi,\" had been amerced half-a-merk by Alan de Nevill. I am unable to state the precise period when, by favour of Henry II, Philip Fitz Helgot became connected with the Royal Manor and Forest of Kinver, which adjoined his estate at Bob bington. Certainly it was before 1176, when, under the name of Philip de Kenefare, he is found in great disgrace ; for he accounts for a fine of 100 merks that he may have the King's good-will, and for his forfeiture in regard to the Forest, and for redemption of his land.3 In 1182 he was still owing a small arrear of this fine, and there is a note on the Staffordshire Pipe Roll intimating that he should be charged for the balance in Worcestershire. There are other reasons for thinking that he had estates in the latter County.4 Meantime, Thomas Fitz Bernard and Geoffrey Fitz Piers are ac countants for the ferm of Kinver; but about Midsummer 1184, Philip Fitz Helgot was restored, and at Michaelmas following ac counted 45s. for a quarter of the year's ferm of \u00a39. then due. And he continues paying this annual rent of \u00a39. for the rest of Henry II's reign, charging however thereon his expenses \"in re pairing the fence around the Curia and House of the King at Kinver \" and \" in the work of the King's chamber\" there.5 This Ferm seems to have required renewal on the accession of King Richard.

Wherefore said Philip and his heirs are to hold the same in fee-farm of the King and his heirs &c. This Charter passed at Dover on the 5th or 6th of December, 1189.6 During the reign of Richard, Philip Fitz Helgot's Tenure of Kinver seems to have been not undisturbed. In one instance I find the King's Escheator paying a part (42s.) of the annual ferm; but, as this was paid to the King at Rouen, it probably represents the period when the Charter of renewal had not as yet issued. In 1192, Philip de Kenefare accounts himself for a year's ferm and arrears, but in 1197 Geoffrey Fitz Piers is the accountant for a whole year's ferm. I have not looked minutely into this irregu larity of reckoning ; but I cannot help associating it with an entry on a very ancient Plea Roll, which I believe to belong to Trinity Term, 1194. This entry purports that a Suit then depending be tween Philip Fitz Holegod and the Men of Kenfare, about a com plaint (probably of the latter) , should await the arrival of the King (the King crossed to Normandy, May 12, 1194), and in the mean time he (Philip I suppose) commends his office to his Son, under advice of John le Strange.7 Some dispute, it would seem, had arisen between the Fermor and the Burgesses of Kinver, which could only be settled by the King ; so the Forestership was, pendente lite, to be cared for by a third person, under direction of John le Strange. On this same Roll, Philip Fitz Holegod occurs as a Knight com missioned to ascertain the validity of a certain essoign. The matter has been alluded to before.8 One of the earliest Fines offered to King John after his accession (May 27, 1199) was that of \" Philip de Canefare.\" It was one of \u00a3100. \" for having the Manor and Forest of Canefare at fee-farm, as he, Philip, had it from King Richard.

In 1211, on a list of Staffordshire Tenures it is said that Philip Fitz Holegot holds the Forest of Kenefar, with the Manor, by Charter of King Henry (Henry II), and pays \u00a39. per annum, the sum which the Manor had been wont to pay.10 In November 1213, Philip Fitz Helgot was deceased, for then did John Fitz Philip fine fifty merks and a palfrey, that he might have the lands in Salop and Staffordshire which had belonged to the aforesaid Philip his Father.11 The King's Charter, dated at Hereford on Nov. 27, grants to John, son of Philip Fitz Helgot, and his heirs, the vill of Kenefare and custody of the Forest thereof, in fee-farm at the old rent of \u00a39. per annum.1- I must content myself with giving references to various Writs of King John and King Henry III, which imply the continuance of this trust, and the charge which John Fitz Philip had from the latter King to fortify his own Castle, and rebuild the Royal resi dence at Kinver.13 In the earliest of these he is called King John's Valet. In 1214, he seems to have accompanied that Monarch into Poitou, and had some indulgence as to his debts to the Crown.14 On April 10, 1216, being faithful to King John, he had a grant of the lands of Thomas de Constantine in Eton (Constantine) and Eldebury (Oldbury), and of Richard de Leighton, in Leighton and Garmston, both of whom were then in rebellion.15 On July 2, 1221, he had a grant of Market at Kinver provisionally, till Henry III should come of age.16 On July 6, 1223, he had a grant of the forfeited Chattels of a, fugitive murderer at Barlaston.17 On the 25th of April, 1227, the King renews his grant of Kinver Town and Forest in the terms of King John's Charter, and at the same rent (\u00a39.) -18 Hence I presume that a Staffordshire Roll, of apparently a few years' later date, which states the said rent to be m. 4; Rot. de Prestito, 213, 228, 237 5 Rot.

Soon afterwards he appears paying the King an annual rent of \u00a340. for the Yorkshire Manor of Masham, which was the inherit ance of John, son of John de Wauton, then a Minor ; but on April 25, 1234, he gives the King 200 merks that he may have the said Manor (rent-free, I suppose) for himself or his assigns during the remainder of such minority.21 His fine of April 1235, for the wardship of John de Astley's heirs, has already been recited. At Michaelmas 1235, he had, by the King's directions, paid John le Strange, Constable of Mont gomery, thirty merks on account of these fines.32 A Patent of October 18, 1235, would make it appear that John Fitz Philip had appointed one William de Bernolesby his Bailiff, and contingently his Executor, in respect of the Wardships which he had purchased ; for the King grants, that while said William shall so be Bailiff, he shall not be put on any Assize (Jury), and if he should die, his Brother should have custody of the lands and heirs of John de Wauton and John de Estleg.23 These precautions were probably taken in consequence of John Fitz Philip's advanced age, and the minority of his own son and heir. In 1236, I notice that Thomas Corbet compounds for five merks \" his false clamour against John Fitz Philip.\" Before I close my account of John Fitz Philip of Bobbinton, I should notice the grant which, under that title, he made to Tren tham Priory of the Advowson of Barliston Chapel. It was attested by Ranulph Earl of Chester, then present, Sir John le Strange, Sir Henry de Audley, Sir Philip d'Orreby, William Parson of Stokes, and Geoffrey Griffin. It probably passed between 1220 and 1230.24 Before Dec. 29, 1238, John Fitz Philip was dead, having, as it seems, added to his latest speculations the ferm or custody of the vacant See of Durham.25 19 Testa de Nevill, p. 52, b. 20 Pat. 14 Hen.

Two Lists of Fees in the Testa de Nevill, which date about this time, give us the Heir of John Fitz Philip as holding in Berleston (Barlaston) and Bolnton (Bobbington) of the Barony of Stafford.27 The tenure would seem to be by service of one Knight's fee ; but a third, and probably more accurate list, gives the service due on Dubington (so written) as one fee, and on Berleston half-a-fee.28 Ou Nov. 25, 1243, the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire had orders to distrain the Widow of John Fitz Philip, so as that she should give up to the King the Son and Heir of said John, whom William de Ferrers Earl of Derby had entrusted to her. Also the Sheriff was similarly to cause John le Strange to appear before the Barons of the Exchequer ou January 14 following, and to give account of all issues of the lands of said John Fitz Philip since Le Strange had had them in custody.29 In the following year (1243-4), the King again committed to the custody of the same John le Strange, Justice of Chester, all the lands of John Fitz Philip, as well as Kinver Forest.30 On December 27, 1248, John Fitz Philip (the younger) occurs 1240, under the title, \" Episcopatus Du nolm.\" In 1241, they appear on the Shropshire Pipe Roll, and so on till 1246, without any notice of the Debtor's de cease. In that year some deductions on the charge are stated, but the balance was not paid till 1253, when John Fitz Philip (the Son I suppose) is entered as paying the said balance. at Bernoleby, Waltham, andWathe (Lin colnshire) were acquired by grant of King Henry III, the said grant being speci fically 30 lilrates of rent in the Soke of Waltham.

The Jurors of Brug reported that \" his Father had made purpresture of two acres and a half in Morf Forest, \u2014 a matter which had already been brought before the Justiciars.\" 35 Whittimere is now that member of Bobbington which lies in Shropshire. Beside three virgates and a half which John Fitz Philip held in Claverley, the Jurors of that Manor found him to hold a hide in Witimere by service of doing suit thrice a year to the Court of Claverley.36 We shall have other instances where the Court of Claverley had attracted the suit of Manors which were no part of the ancient demesne of the Crown. In 1257, he had a grant of Fair and Market at Kinver. In 1262, John Fitz Philip de Bobinton and Petronilla his Mother are assessed 7s. 6d. for imbladements in Morf Forest. At the same time he essoigned himself from attendance at the Assizes, due under common summons.37 I have intimated under Claverley the probability that Johu Fitz Plhlip joined and suffered for his share in the Rebellion of 1264-5.

In 1282, he had two similar summonses, \u2014 one for May 7, at Worcester ; the other for August 2, at Rhuddlan. To the latter he makes the same acknowledgment as before, naming William Perot his Deputy, and apparently alleging his duties as a Royal Forester in excuse for so acting by deputy.39 In 1284, he is returned as holding Barlaston, in Pirehill Hundred, by one Knight's Fee, and Bolinton (Bobington) in Seisdon Hundred, by one Knight's Fee, \u2014 both of Nicholas Barou Stafford.40 In 1287, he had summons to attend a Military Council, to be held at Gloucester on July 15, before Edmund Earl of Cornwall.41 In January 1293, the King's Justices, who were trying causes of Quo Waranto, baring reached Staffordshire, John Fitz Philip was questioned as to his title to hold pleas of the Crown and to have free warren, Fair, Market, Gallows, and Ways in Kynefare. In his reply he denied any claim of free-warren, Kynefare being within the King's Forest. As to other privileges, he pleaded King Richard's Charter to his Ancestor, and the prescriptive exercise of such rights, as always held to be appurtenant to such a Charter. Hugh de Louther claimed the same rights as appurtenant to the King's Hundred of Seisdon ; but the Jury found for the Defendant as regarded the holding Manorial Courts, and having Gallows and Ways. As to Fair and Market, King Henry Ill's Charter was alleged in Warranty ; and so the matter ended.42 In the following Easter Term, the King was suing John Fitz Philip for the Advowson of Kinver Church,43 but with what result I know not. 58 Shaw, II, 287.

In 1297, John Fitz Philip had been returned by the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire among those who held ,\u00a320. of lands and upwards in those Counties. He was therefore summoned to attend at London on July 7, to perform military service in person, with horse and arms, in parts beyond the seas.44 John Fitz Philip had still the Forestership of Kinver in 1300.45 He was summoned for personal service against the Scots, and to attend the Muster at Berwick-upon-Tweed ou June 24, 1301.46 He must at this time have been upwards of seventy years of age. Some later notices which I have of him shall be given under Quat. I should here say that he was living in 1305, but deceased before March 1316, when John de Vaux was Lord of Kinver, Hugh de Hulpham of Bobbington, and Roger Corbet of Barlaston.47 De Vaux' succession to John Fitz Philip was not by inheritance, but under grant of the Crown. The coheirs of the deceased were Joan, daughter of John de Wauton, and Roger Corbet of Hadlev. A tabular pedigree which I propose to insert under Quat will show the mode in which I conceive this Coheirship to have arisen; but full proof of all the particulars is wanting. Certain however it is that the above-named Joan had Bobbington, and conveyed it to her husband, Hugh de Hulpham. The latter, called in this instance, Hugh de Hepham, appears to have died in 13 Edw. II (1319-20), when the Escheator ultra Trent was ordered to seize his lands.48 There is no Inquisition post mortem to tally with that order, and indeed it is probable that all the estates enjoyed by Hepham came with his wife Joan, who survived him. Consistently with this we find that Masham and its adjuncts, which were of the inheritance of John de Wauton, a Minor in 1234, were in 1316 held by Hugh de Hepham.49 Joan de Wauton, during her widowhood, is known to have alienated Bernolby, Waltham, Wathe, and Quat,\u2014 all which came to her from John Fitz Philip. Almost certainly she sold Masham also to Geoffrey de Scrope, the purchaser of Bernolby, Waltham 44 Parliamentary Writs, I, 291. in Barlaston. (Inq. 28 Edw.

The probability is that she sold Bobbington also, but to another person. On August 15, 1323, \"Joan de Butetourte Lady of Weleye,\" as she styles herself, was evidently seized of what had been John Fitz Philip's Tenure in Bobbington.50 She was youngest Sister and Coheir of John, last *Baron Somery of Dudley, who died Dec. 29, 1322, and, at the time I speak of, she was Widow of Thomas, eldest son of John Baron Botetourte, who died before his Father. Her son, another John, had livery in 1338, though not then of age. There is abundant evidence of his succeeding to Bobbington. I now proceed to classify and comment upon those Charters of John Fitz Philip (II) which I have before alluded to. \u2014 In the earliest of these, as indeed in all his Charters, he styles himself John, son of John Fitz Philip. It is a grant to his Burgesses of Kinfare. It has been printed elsewhere, but with much inac curacy.51 I give the witnesses' names in a note, for the sake of comparison with his later Deeds. These are eight in number, and all existent in the originals \u2014 1. John, son of John Fitz Philip Lord of Bobynton, grants to Ema, daughter of William de la Leton, and to Gilbert his (the Grantor's) Son, a noke of land in his Manor of Bobynton, viz., that which the said William formerly held, also two crofts and a garden ; \u2014 to hold of the Grantor and his heirs, to Ema and Gilbert and their heirs ; \u2014 paying for rent, a Red Rose.52 This, I presume is part of the provision made by the Grantor for Emma de la Leton (Leaton was a member of Bobbington) on her marriage with his Son. 2. The same grants to Ema de la Leton a parcel of land in the Lee, bounded by lands of Robert Cocus and Richard Clerk. 50 She grants a feoffment inBobbington, under that date.

Gilbert, only son, as I suppose, of John Fitz Philip, would seem to have married between 1270 and 1280, as far as I can judge from the above Deeds. It is quite clear that either he and his Sisters died before their Father and without issue, or else, as I am rather inclined to believe, that they were all three illegitimate. It is further observable in these Deeds how many of the wit nesses are Tenants of the Barons of Dudley. This may have arisen from local circumstances, or possibly the Lords of Dudley had acquired some interest, immediate or reversionary, in Bobbing ton before John Fitz Philip's death. Whittimere, as being that member of Bobbington which lies in Shropshire, requires special notice. The early Tenants of this Vill were probably Ancestors of a family which has come in later years to occupy much more im portant positions in Shropshire and elsewhere.60 I find an Alan de Wytemere assessed by the Regarders of Morf Forest in 1209, for a purpresture therein. William de Witimere was a Juror on the Claverley Inquest of 1255, probably representing the Suit which John Fitz Philip owed for Whittimere to that Manor. At the same time, Agnes de Haselwalle held half an acre of purpresture in Witimere, but paid the King nothing thereon.

Also \" Richard of the Field of Witimere \" occurs about the same time. In 1323, Joan Butetourte's Deed, already referred to, is attested by \" Richard of the Mount of Wythemere.\" BOBBINGTON CHURCH. Bobbington seems ever to have been parochially a member of Claverley. It is not quite clear what it was in Bobbington and Laiton (Leaton) which Earl Roger de Montgomery granted to Quatford College at its foundation.61 Neither place was within Earl Roger's Fief: I therefore suppose that his Grant must have been of an ecclesiastical character, viz., glebe or tithes previously belonging to Claverley. When or by whom a district Church was first founded at Bob bington I cannot declare. Certainly it was previous to the year 1221, when King Henry III (on behalf of the Dean of Brug as Rector of Claverley) sued John Fitz Philip under writ of Darrein presentment for the right of Advowson. Notwithstanding that the King gained the cause upon a hearing by Martin de Patshull, it appears that John Fitz Philip presented Walter de Cokesaye to Bobbington. This must have been before 1238, when John Fitz Philip died. I have already shown6- how in the year 1267 a double action had arisen between Walter de Cokesaye and the Dean of Brug: the former being Plaintiff in a suit of ejectment, the latter in a suit of trespass. The suit of ejectment having come before the King at Shrews bury in August 1267, each party recited such of the above facts as suited his case, Walter de Cokesaye also calling as a witness John Fitz Philip (Junior), who stated that his Father was always seized of the Advowson. The case was adjourned to September 10th, when it had assumed another and very natural form, \u2014 the King being apparently the Plaintiff, and John Fitz Philip Junior as well as Cokesaye the Defendants. An adjournment to Oct. 13th, as before related, was the result, in consequence of Cokesaye's non-appearance. But on Oct. 13th it was John Fitz Philip who did not appear, and whose Manucaptors were declared to be in misericordid. His ultimate surrender of the right of presentation has before been shown. 01 Vide Vol. I, p. 109. 62 Vol. I, pp. 334, 335, 336, where one I matter of detail will have to be corrected 1 by the above."], [207, "173 QUAT Meanwhile, that is in 1255, part of the lands of the Deanery of Brug were stated to lie in Witimere ; and Bobington Church was known to the Claverley Jurors as a member of the Church of Claverley, and of the Deanery of Brug.63 All that I can further say of this Church is of its remaining subject to Claverley. As it stood within the Peculiar Jurisdiction of Bridgnorth, I can offer no lists of its Incumbents. I doubt however whether the latter title was applicable to those De puties of the Dean of Brug who may have served the Chapel of Bobbington. The title of \" Pastor,\" applied above to one of these Chaplains, is perhaps significant.64 <&uat. The etymology of this name has already been indicated.1 Domesday mentions Quat thus, under the lands of Earl Roger in Stanlei Hundred, Warwickshire. \u2014 Outi holds of the Earl iii hides in Quatone. Here is (arable) land (sufficient) for xn ox- teams. In demesne are mi (such teams) ; and there are v Serfs, xix Villains, and xiiii Boors, with x teams. Here is one acre of meadow ; a Wood two leagues long and one league wide, and a Mill of 2s. (annual value). The former value (of the Manor) was \u00a36. Its present value is 100s. The same Outi held it freely (in time of King Edward) 7 Here then we have a Manor in Saxon hands, stocked beyond its requirements, and yet deteriorated in value since it came to be held under a Norman Lord. Outi the Saxon, like others of his race, will have been dispos sessed, not long after Domesday ; and I suppose that Quat came to the hands of Henry I as a Manor of demesne, subject to any disposal he might choose to make thereof. His mode of dealing therewith I cannot determine from any documentary evidence ; as usual therefore I offer an hypothesis, which must be tested by its own probability and its agreement with subsequent and better known events. Of the three Domesday hides of Quat I identify half-a-hide with 63 Rot. Hund.

His Grantees I further take to have been three sons of Helgot (the Domesday Lord of Stanton, and the Founder of Castle Holgate) . The three Sons in question were, I think, Herbert (the successor to his Father's Barony), Wydo, and one whose name I cannot even offer in theory, but whom I take to have been Father or Grandfather of that Philip Fitz Helgot whom we have said so much of under Bobbington. I will first treat of Wydo Fitz Helgot's share, now known as \u2014 Quat Malvern. \u2014 I can say very little of the Lord thereof, except that he attests a very ancient Charter of \"Herbert Fitz Holegod\" (his Brother, I suppose), which I shall give at length under Dudmaston. He also seems to have held under Henry I a hide of land in Worcestershire, but where we are not told ; and thirdly, a vill, written \" Achiseia \" or \" Hakiesheia,\" which was an appurtenance of the Royal Manor of Stottesden, and for which Wydo paid the King a fee-farm rent of 2s. per annum. These three estates at Quat, Stottesden, and in Worcestershire, Wydo Fitz Helgot granted before the year 1127 to the Priory of Great Malvern. Henry I, being at Hereford in 1126 or 1127, conceded and gave, inter alia, to Malvern, those two solidates of land, \"that is, Acheseia, which pertains to Stottesdun, for which Wido Fitz Helgot used to render 2s. per annum ot ferm.\"4, \u2014 He also concedes it to them quit of those two shillings, \"and of all other services, for the health of his soul. He further concedes to them \" two hides of land, altogether quit of all gelds and all other claims and assessments (querelis et scotis), whereof one is in Worcestershire, and another in Staffordshire at Quat.\" 5 3 The remaining half-hide I cannot identify. Perhaps it was annexed to Morf Forest ; perhaps Dudmaston, when esti mated at half a hide, does not include Lye-hall, and the deficient half-bide was there. don ; but I ought to say that, in conse quence of the King's quittance of his rent, the Sheriffs of Shropshire for ages de ducted from their annual ferms a sum of 2s., in alms to the Monks of Malvern; thus \u2014 \"In elemosynis constitutis Mo nachi3 de Malvern 2s.\" * This is not the place to investigate the situation of this member of Stottes- 5 Monasticon, III, 447, II."], [209, "175 QUAT. \u2014 QUAT MALVERN. Another Charter of Henry I to Malvern, dated at Winchester in 1127, makes it more clear that Wydo Fitz Helgot was the primary Grantor of these two hides. \u2014 \" I give them moreover,\" says the King, \" two hides of land which Wydo Fitz Holgod surrendered into my hand, whereof one is in Worcestershire, and the other in Staffordshire by name Quat, \u2014 quit (as before), and to hold of me and my successors in capite.\" 6 Quat then was, in 1127, estimated to lie in Staffordshire, \u2014 a significant hint that the present territorial divisions of Shropshire were not then settled. But it is a very remarkable fact, that three years later we have undoubted evidence that Quat was still, for some purposes, reputed to be in its Domesday County, Warwick shire. \u2014 The Sheriff of the latter gives, in the Pipe Roll of 1130, a list of those who, by Writ Royal, had been excused their quota of the Danegeld then assessed on that County. Among them the Monks of Malvern stand excused 2s.7 That was certainly in respect of their land at Quat,8 and in accordance with the express terms of the King's Charters above cited. A Tenure Roll,9 which seems from its internal evidence to have been drawn up in 1211, says that \"the Prior of Malverne holds certain land in Quatte of the gift of King Henry, Grandfather 10 of King John, in perpetual alms, and its value is \u00a31. 17s. 8d.\" (per annum). At the Forest Assizes held in Shropshire in 1231, the Prior of Great Malverne was amerced one merk for some default.11 In 1255, the Jurors of Brug reported that the Prior of Greater Malvern held within the Liberty of Brug one hide in the vill of Quatte. They knew not of whom or by what Warranty he held it. The said Prior had also the Advowson of the Church. The Church was worth ten merks ( per annum) . The Prior, it also appears, was one of those who did not attend at this Inquest, as all Free Tenants within the Liberty of Brug were expected to do.13 6 Ibidem, p. 448, III. I need hardly point out that at this period, when a Tenant wished to make any transfer of property, a surrender to his Suzerain was a formal mode of doing so, the Suzerain regranting it according to the said Te nant's wish.

In Easter Term 1270, the Prior of Malvern was suing Richard Hendemon (whom I have already identified as Provost of Brug in that year) and others, at Westminster, for some trespass. In 1291, the Prior of Malvern's rents at Quatte, in the Deanery of Trysull, were returned at \u00a31. 6s. 8c?.13 At the Shropshire Assizes, October 1292, the Jurors of Stottes den represented how the \" Abbot (read Prior) of Malvern, claimed to hold his free Court twice a year, to have assize of bread and beer, and to have ways, and pleas of bloodshed, and hue-and-cry, in Quatte.\" The Prior stated in justification that his House was a Cell of Westminster Abbey, to which Henry III had granted view of frankpledge throughout all its possessions. At the same Assizes, the Jurors of Brug said that John Fitz Philip Senior once held the whole Manor of Quatte, with the Advowson of the Church, by serjeantry (in which they were quite wrong) ; that at the then present time, John Fitz Philip held one half thereof, and the Prior of Malvern the other half, which, if we exclude Dudmaston, was correct. \u2014 The Prior, they also said, had now the Advowson of the Church. The Prior appeared by his Attorney to prove his title, which was, that his Predecessors had held half the Manor and the Advowson, in pure and perpetual alms, from time immemorial, and this he was prepared to \" verify \" as the Court should require. Hugh de Louther hereupon asked judgment for the Crown, \"since the Prior could not deny that his share of the Manor was once held by Serjeantry, and since he had no evidence as to the point of perpetual alms,\" even if he were allowed his request about verification. The Prior here fined one merk to have the case adjourned to the next Par liament ; \u2014 obviously that he might search his Muniments,14 which we know must have proved his case, though I cannot refer to the sequel of this vexatious prosecution. In obedience to the King's Writ, dated at Strivelyn, July 6, 1304, a Jury sat at Brug, on Sept. 19 following, to ascertain whether it would injure the King if he were to allow Hugh Prior of Great Malvern to regain a messuage, a Mill, and one acre of land in Quatte, which had been forfeited to the King, inasmuch as the Prior had acquired the same by gift of Roger Fitz Alan of Quatte, since the publication of the Statute of Mortmain. The Jury found that Richard, a former Prior, had made the 13 Pope Nich. Taxation, 257, b. m. 20 and 37 dorso. 14 Placita Corona, Salop, 20 Edw. I,"], [211, "177 QUAT.

In the following year (1305), the Prior regained the Mill, and compounded his Predecessor's fault by a fine of one merk paid to the King.16 Quatte Malvern remained in possession of the Priory in 1534-5, when the rents and other income receivable therefrom were \u00a33. Os. 9c?.17 Quat Jarvis, Wooton, and Mose. \u2014 These I suppose to have constituted that hide in Quat which King Henry I probably gave to another son of Helgot, to be held by Serjeantry. And the first Grantee I imagine to have been Father or Grandfather (most probably the latter) of Philip Fitz Helgot. In 1165, the return of Philip Fitz Helgot as a Tenant in capite undoubtedly relates to his estate at Quat, and would seem to imply that more than one Ancestor had preceded him therein. It is as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 \" I, Philip Fitz Elgod, owe service of one Knight for xl days in the Castle of Sewardin (Shrawardine), as my Antecessors were wont to do.\" 18 I have made frequent mention of lands held in capite by service at the once Royal Castle of Shrawardine, and how such service came afterwards in many cases to be returnable at Montgomery instead. In the case before us the Serjeantry substituted for service at Shrawardine was not that of Castle-Guard elsewhere. \u2014 In 1211, Philip Fitz Holegot was returned as a Tenant in capite, whose duty it was to find two infantry soldiers in the King's army in Wales.19 In 1255, the Jurors of Brug gave a full and specific account of this Serjeantry, as then held by Philip's Grandson. They said that, \u2014 13 Liber Niger, I, 148 ; verified from the Original. 15 Inquisitions, 32 Edw.

In tracing the history of Philip Fitz Helgot's descendants, whether under Claverley, or Bobbington, or Barlaston, we find some, as yet unexplained, association with the family of Corbet of Hadley.31 This appears still more strongly in Quat, where Edelina, Widow of that Roger Corbet of Hadley who died in 1259, was resident in 1270. In Easter Term 1270 and Easter Term 1271, she appears as Plaintiff in a suit or suits against Henry de la Porte, Richard Tyrry, William de Baggeshore, Richard de Wrottesleg, Roger son of Roger de la More of Brug, Alan de Eudon, Hugh de Mose, and many others, whom she accused of coming vi et armis to her house at Quat, breaking open the doors, and doing other damage to the extent of \u00a310. \u2014 There is no Record of the Defendants' appearing or pleading to the charge, so I am unable to give further particulars. The Plaintiff was, I believe, Sister and, in her issue, Coheir of John Fitz Philip (II), then Lord of Quat. At the County Assizes, October 1292, the Jurors of Stottesden presented John Fitz Philip as exercising in his Manor of Quat the same privileges as the Prior of Malvern was questioned for. The result does not appear. But the Jurors of Brug reported, under the title \" Serjeantries,\" that John Fitz Philip Senior (\"Senex\") once held the Manor of Quat with the Advowson of the Church in capite ; that the gross value was J20.

The inaccuracy of this was corrected by John Fitz Philip's statement, who, in reply, said 20 -Eo*. Bund. II, 59.

In 1305, \" John, son of John Fitz Philip,\" gave the King a Fine of 40s. to have license to enfeoff Roger de Lee, Clerk, in a moiety of the Manor of Quatte. 23 The object of this was to avoid the future Fine of his intended Successor here, and Roger de Lee was only Feoffee in Trust. \u2014 But the whole of the process is worth giving. \u2014 On January 16, 1305, the King had ordered an Inquest to ascer tain what injury would result to the Crown if license were given for the proposed transfer, it being understood that Roger de la Lee, as soon as he had seizin of the premises, should transfer them to John Fitz John Fitz Philip and Sara his wife for their lives, with remainder to Johanna, daughter of John de Wauton. The Inquest, which was held at Quat on Feb. 4, 1305, found that the premises were held by Serjeantry of providing one Archer with a bow, an arrow, and a caltrop (tribulo), to escort the King from Brug to Shrawarthyn &c. ;\u25a0 \u2014 that the annual value of this moiety of Quat was \u00a312. ; and that John Fitz John would, after the pro posed alienation, have no other lands in Shropshire. It was further found that the King would suffer loss by the proposed transfer in this way. \u2014 If John died seized, the estate would ordinarily descend to two coheirs, viz., to Roger, son and heir of Thomas Corbet, and to Johanna, daughter and heir of John de Wauton, of both of whom the King would have the custody and marriage,24 by reason of their tenure in Quat, whenever any minority of an heir should happen. So, on the whole, the King would lose one wardship by the proposed settlement, viz., that of Roger, son and heir of Thomas Corbet.25 22 Placita Caron\u0153, 20 Edw.

And,\" it is added, \" this Concord was made by precept of the King.\" 26 I conceive that John Fitz Philip (II) survived this settlement but a very short time, and that he died without lawful issue, son or daughter. He was the last male representative of the younger branch of the house of Helgot. The elder branch thereof had failed in the male line more than a century before. The Coheirs of John Fitz Philip (II) have never, I believe, been pointed out by Genealogists ; much less has their degree of con sanguinity been ascertained. It is certain however that the said Coheirs were Joan de Wauton and Roger Corbet of Hadley, and it is almost certain that they were Great Niece and Great Nephew of John Fitz Philip (II) ; \u2014 Grandchildren that is of his Sisters, * * *, and Edelina. With Roger Corbet we have no concern at present, but this is the place to make clear whatever is known of the descent of Joan de Wauton. \u2014 It will be remembered that on the death of John de Wauton, Lord of Masham (Yorkshire), in 1230, the wardship of his infant heir was granted to John Fitz Philip (I).27 This heir, a second John de Wauton, had a very long minority; in fact he was still under age in 1244, that is, six years after his Guardian's death. However there can be little doubt that his marriage was secured for one of the said Guardian's daughters, but what was her name I cannot declare. Neither can I say more of her husband, John de Wauton (II), than that he appears to be the person named in five return of all Writs, and who make reply, as appeareth in the Inquest attached to this Writ\" The Jurors are Roger Bo nami, Richard de Vascon, Nicholas Ron dulf, and other persons connected with the Borough.

In 1290 then I find notice that the homage of John de Wauton and Margaret his wife was accepted by the Crown.29 I also find that in that year an Inquest was ordered to ascertain whether John, son of John de Wauton, or Gilbert de Clare, was owner of the Manor of Waldingham (Surrey), which had been seized into the King's hand.30 The result of that inquiry is not pertinent to our present subject. I proceed therefore to state that this John de Wauton (III) being, as I suppose, Nephew and Coheir expectant of John Fitz Philip fil), enjoyed a great part of his said Uncle's estates during that Uncle's life. Such transfers to an heir were not uncommon at the time. The Estates which John de Wauton thus received were those of Bernoleby, Waltham, and Wathe, in Lincolnshire ; and it was doubtless in respect of his possession thereof, that under the name of John de Wawton he was in the year 1300 returned as one of those who, holding \u00a340. of rents and lands in the County of Lincoln, were liable to the Military Summons, which enjoined a Muster at Carlisle on June 24 against the Scots.31 John Fitz Philip (II) be it remembered, was still living. So was he also living in 1304, when John de Wauton (III), his presumed Nephew, died. Three Inquests on tbe death of \" John de Walton,\" as he is called, sat at Houton (Norfolk), Waltham (Lincolnshire), and Mash am (Yorkshire), on June 6, July 9, and July 18, 1304. They re spectively reported his tenures in Northpikenham, in Waltham, Bernolby, and Wathe, and in Masham and its adjuncts. The lands at Northpikenham, said the Norfolk Jurors, were held conjointly by the deceased and his wife Margaret, under feoffment and gift of Maria de Neville. The name of John de Walton's daughter and heir was Joan, and her age in 1304 was fourteen years.32 We now see how it was that in February 1305, Johanna, daugh ter, of John de Wauton, was secured in the reversion of Quat by John Fitz Philip (II) being already one of his expectant Coheirs. 28 Parliamentary Writs, I, 897. \u00bb Harleian MSS. 1982, so. 51, b. been indicated on a different occasion (Supra, p. 164).

Her subsequent marriage to Hugh de Hepham, and the death of the latter in 1319-20, have already been detailed. In the year of her husband's death (1319-20), \" Johanna, daugh ter of John de Wauton,\" sold Waltham, Bernolby, and Wathe, by Royal License, to Geoffrey le Scrope.33 Almost surely one of her heirs sold Masham to the same Geoffrey, who thus obtained its distinctive title of \" Scroope of Masham\" for the Baronial House which he founded. Of her Manor of Quat, Johanna made another disposition, but in the same year (1319-20) ; for then Robert de Wauton (probably her Relation) paid five merks for the royal license to receive the same from \" Johanna, widow of Hugh de Hepham.\"84 I cannot say how Quat passed from Robert de Wauton to a fourth John de Wauton. The latter however was seized thereof in 1328, when, on March 23, the King orders an Inquest to be taken as to a proposition entertained by the said John, of enfeoffing Richard de Welles in the same; \u2014 to hold to the said Richard and his heirs of the King in capite. The Jurors, assembled at Brug on August 8 following, declared that the proposed transfer would not injure the Crown ; \u2014 that the Manor was held by serjeantry of providing one footman with a bow, a bolt (petilio), and an arrow, to convoy the King's stores (vitilia) from Bruges to Shrewardyn Castle. The annual value of the Manor they said, was \u00a310. A carucate of sandy land, a water-mill, and eight merks of rents, were its chief constituents. The proposed Feoffor had no other lands in Shropshire.35 That Richard de Welles thus became Lord of Quat, and that he was probably of kin to the Wautons, appears by another Inquisitio ad quod damnum, ordered by Writ of Dec. 16, 1332, and held at Brugge on Jan. 18, 1333. The Jurors found that the King would suffer no loss by a propo sition of Richard de Welles, viz., that he should give a messuage, six acres of land, and four merks rent in Quatte to a Chaplain and his Successors, who should celebrate divine services in the Church of Quatte for the souls of the said Richard, of Joanna de Wauton, and of their ancestors. The King, added the Jurors, would lose custody of so much land &c. on the decease of any Lord of Quatte.

The residue, remaining to Welles, would suffice for the discharge of all customs and services.36 Another Writ Royal, dated October 7, 1341, shows Richard de Welles proposing to enfeoff Henry de Mortimer in his Manor of Quatte, to hold to Henry and his heirs of the King in capite, so however as that Henry, as soon as he had seizin, should grant the same to Richard for life, with remainder to Hugh de Mortimer and Margaret his wife for their lives, and with remainder to the right heirs of Hugh de Mortimer. Pursuant to this Writ, an Inquest held at Quat on Oct. 24, 1341, reported the proposed transfer to be uninjurious to the Crown, the Manor to be worth \u00a310. per annum, the Serjeantry to lie by providing a foot soldier with one bow and two arrows &c. (according to the older statement), and Richard de Welles to have no other lands in the County.37 Doubtless this transfer ultimately took effect, but I should explain that Henry de Mortimer, ostensibly only a Trustee in the above matter, was in fact the eldest son and heir apparent of Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh, the first Reversioner under the proposed settlement.38 Richard de Welles seems to have died seized of Quat in 1357; Henry de Mortimer died before his Father Hugh, and the latter died in 127.2, but the Inquest on his death does not set forth his seizin of Quat. However Quat was one of those estates which, after the death of Hugh de Mortimer, were seized into the King's hands by reason of the idiocy of William de Mortimer, Hugh's Grandson and heir. Consequently, on William's death in 1391, his estates so seized were found to have been Chelmarsh and its member of Sutton (held of the Earl of March), meadow (held of Hugh de Du Lye-Hall (held of Hugh de Du Caus (held of John Mouth e), < ton, members of Chelmarsh, w Quatte (held of the King), and a Dudmaston) .

Certainly it was no portion of the estate of Richard de Welles. Again, on the death of Sir Hugh de Mortimer, who was killed at the battle of Shrewsbury (July 21, 1403), he was found to have held Quatte in capite at the time of his death, but Chelmarsh, Lyehall, and other estates he had conveyed to Trustees during his life.*1 Again, John de Cressi Senior, Cousin and heir of Hugh de Mortimer, dying in 1407-8 (as I now find) was possessed of two thirds of Quat;42 and Petronilla, widow of Hugh de Mortimer, dying in 1423, was seized of the remaining third.*3 The heir to all three portions was at that period John de Cressy Junior, whose elder brother Thomas had died in infancy. With him I may-quit a subject which has already tempted me far beyond my usual limits. DUDMASTON. This Manor, constituting a part of the Domesday Quatone, and still within the Parish of Quat, I suppose to have been granted by Henry I to Herbert Fitz Helgot, of whose Barony it thenceforward became a Member. Herbert again, duriug the time of Henry I, enfeoffed one of his Norman Retainers here. The Charter which records this act is still in existence **, and is perhaps the earliest original document of its class which I shall ever be able to cite in illustration of the Manorial History of Shropshire. I therefore give it unmutilated by a translation, and only trusting that I resolve its contractions rightly, and read certain letters of very ancient form with accuracy. \" Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Herebertus filius Holegod dominus Castri dedi et concessi et hac presenti carta mea con firmavi Harlewyno de Butailles45 pro homagio et servicio suo 39 Inquisitions, 15 Ric.

Again we have seen, under Quat Malvern, that Wydo Fitz Helgot had parted with all his interest in this neigh- 46 4f\u00bb Sic. there is very little which can be said dog matically on the subject ; and Mr. Hardy gives two actual cases where the formulas \"Habendum et tenendum\" and \"Testi bus hiis \" were used in Stephen's reign. 47 Here the word suum seems to be omitted. 49 I have before stated (Vol. I, p. 152) that there were reasons against assigning so early a date to this Charter. The rea sons are, the introduction of the formulas \" habendas et tenendas \" aud \" hiis testi bus,\" and of a Clause of Warranty. I have before alluded to this question (Vol. II, p. 169), and shall probably have again to do so ; for the truth is, that, in stead of grounding deductions on former theories, our business in this matter is to collect materials for forming theories them selves. At one time I was guided in these matters by certain rules (which I sup posed to be generally received among Antiquaries) for estimating the dates of Charters by their phraseology. We have very few Manorial Deeds of Henry's I's time; so few, that when we do happen to meet with such a document, we do not recognise its date at onee, having no direct analogy to guide us. My own experience, and Mr. Hardy's able Introduction to the Charter-Rolls of King John, have since taught me that"], [223, "QUAT. \u2014 DUDMASTON. 187 bourhood before 1127; \u2014 therefore it is unlikely that at any later period he should appear in this way as a witness. I shall not here undertake any connected account of the Lords of Castle Holgate, but proceed with that of their Tenants at Dud maston. In 1165, Herbert de Castello, son, I believe, of Herbert above mentioned, returned his Shropshire Barony as consisting of five Knights' fees of old feoffment. Of these fees one was held by Herlewin de Dudemanneston, evidently the original Feoffee, or his Son. Thus were Norman names and the proofs of Norman origin forgotten and buried on acquisition of English estates. Eighty years now elapse in which I have nothing positive to offer as to the succession of the Lords of Dudmaston.50 In October 1237, Peter de Dudmaston was one of thirteen Shrop shire Knights who met the King at Worcester to try a particular issue, arising out of a great cause then depending between Henry de Audley and Giles de Erdinton. In or about 1240, this same Peter was returned as holding one Knight's fee in Dudemaneston, under Thomas Mauduit, the then Baron of Castle Holgate.51 About the same time he was one of twelve Knights appointed to value the Manor of Worfield.53 Within ten years of this time I find mention of a Robert de Dudmaston,53 who, though probably a son of Peter, was not, I think, his heir. Peter was deceased in or before 1249; for in Michaelmas Term of that year, Sibil, his Widow, was suing many Tenants of the estate for small parcels of land which she claimed as dower. Eleven acres in Dudmaston held by Roger Fitz Hugh, a Mill held by Master Walter le Palmer, six acres held by William Miller, a messuage held by Hugh Master, a messuage and half virgate held by Warin de Letton, an acre held by William Buth, ten acres held by Henry Cointrel and Peter his Son, an acre of meadow held by the same Henry, and an acre held by the same and Henry de Arle ; \u2014 these were the premises in which Sibil re- quired her thirds. \u2014 She named Robert de Dudmaneston and Philip de Beneth al her 50 A Robert Fitz Herlewin occurs on the Worcestershire Pipe Roll of 1182, but under circumstances which do not identify him.

Under the name Peter, in the above extract, the name Hugo has beeu coevally written, and then cancelled.\u2014 The confusion was probably between Sibil's deceased husband and that husband's heir, whose name was, I think, Hugh. In Michaelmas Term 1253, I find William Mauduit and Hugh de Dudemoneston arraigned before the Queen in Council for a trespass on the forest-rights of Walter de Clifford. They did not appear, but it was stated, apparently in Hugh's defence, that he was an Esquire (Armiger) of William Mauduit.55 The latter was Lord of Castle Holgate at the time. At the Assizes of January 1256, Hugh de Dudmaston appears under circumstances which doubtless mark him as Lord of the Manor, but which, as they chiefly affect a particular part thereof, I will mention under a separate head. At the same time, Robert de Dudmaston again appears in the lower position which I have already assigned him. In 1270, Hugh de Dudemaston was Defendant in two suits of novel disseizin for tenements in Dudemaston. In the first the complainant was Leticia de Dudemaston ; and Hugh's associates in the defence were John le Somenur and Henry Chaplain of Worfield : in the second, Henry Coynterel was the Plaintiff.56 At the Assizes of October 1272, Hugh de Dudmaston occurs as Chief-Bailiff of Munslow Hundred, and his conduct in that office exposed him to some complaint by the Jurors of Ludlow in the Inquisitions of 1274. 57 The way in which Dudmaston had been separated from the Liberty of Brug in 1274 has already been noticed.58 On Nov. 12, 1279, Hugh de Dudmaston and one whom I take to be his wife concur in a settlement of their estate on themselves for life, and with remainder to three persons, whom I suppose to have been their children ; \u2014 but I give the substance of the docu ment itself, \u2014 viz., a Fine levied at Westminster between Robert de Dodemanston, Complainant, and Hugh de Dodcmanston and Mabel de Castle-Holegod, Deforciants, \u2014 of one messuage, two carucates 54 Placita apud Westm. 33 and 34 Hen.

Robert conceded the premises, \u2014 to hold to Hugh and Mabel, under Robert and his heirs, of his body, for the lives of said Hugh and Mabel; rendering therefore one merk yearly, and doing all capital and other services. The premises, after decease of Hugh and Mabel, to revert to Robert and his heirs, of his body, to hold of the Lords of the Fee. In default of such heirs, remainder to Hugh, Robert's brother, and his heirs, of his body. In default of such heirs, to Royese, Sister of Robert, and her heirs.59 About 1280, Hugh de Dudmaston, as I have before mentioned,60 was Constable of Brug Castle, and seems to have been yet living in 1292. Meanwhile, that is on January 20, 1289, his wife Mabel having apparently deceased, he made a slightly different settlement of his estate. The Fine in this instance purports to be between Robert, son of Hugh de Dudemaneston, Complainant, and Hugh de Dude maneston, Deforciant, of the same premises as before, \u2014 adding a mill, ten acres of meadow, ten acres of pasture, and ten acres of wood, whereof was plea of Convention. Hugh recognizes the right of Robert, to hold to Robert and his heirs of the Lords of the Fee. Robert is to pay Hugh ten merks per annum for life, \u2014 Remainders as before, except that the estate of Hugh, Robert's Brother, is for life only, and not to his issue.61 \u2014 Probably he had taken Holy Orders. Hence, when (in an Inquisition taken at Castle Holgate, May 28, 1295, as to the estate of Philip Burnel, late Lord of that Barony) we find that Robert de Dodemonston was holding certain land thereof by service of one Knight's Fee, the annual value of which was \u00a35. 6s. 8d.,m we have a lucid statement as to the continued tenure of Dudmaston, but do not know whether Hugh, Robert's Father, was still living or not. On Sept. 19, 1304, Robert de Dudmaston was second Juror on the Inquest noticed under Quat-Malvern : but before Feb. 1, 1305, he was deceased, and the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum ordered that account should be taken of his estate, seeing that he held of the Heir of Philip Burnel, then a Ward of the Crown. 59 Pedes Finium, 7 Edw.

The Inquest, taken at Bruges on April 17 following, states that the deceased had held two-thirds of the vill of Dudmaston of the aforesaid heir, by service of a Knight's Fee.

His Son and next heir was named Hugh, and he was fifteen years of age on August 15 previous.63 Hugh de Dudmaston, thus proved to have been born on August 15, 1289, occurs as witness of a local Charter on Nov. 5, 1313. On October 24, 1322, he is himself Grantor in a Deed, whereby \" Hugh Lord of Dodemonston grants to John atte Pyrie, Bercar, for a sum of money, a messuage in Dodemonston lying between the road which leads to the Grantor's Mill and the field called Sevarnesfield ; also some other small parcels of land? \"64 Again, on Dec. 9, 1322, \"Hugh Fitz Robert Lord of Dode monston gives to William le Walkare and Johanna his wife, for a sum of money, six seylions in Alton-field, with pasture for three beasts and thirty sheep, where the Grantor's other free Tenants have common.\" 65 On June 9, 1326, Hugh Fitz Robert, Lord of Dudmaston, gives to Sir William le Forcer, Knight, for a sum of money, all his lands and tenements in Dodemanston, with woods, pastures, reliefs, escheats, &c, and all his lands in Nordleye and Astleye : \u2014 to hold of the Chief Lords of the Fee, to the same William and his heirs for ever, by services due thereon.66 \u2014 This Deed, whatever its import, does not seem to me to have worked the eventual dispossession of the Grantor or his heirs ; for I find Hugh Lord of Dodemastone standing first witness to a Manorial Deed which passed at Dudmaston on August 6, 1331.

Robert de Shireford was a Clerk or Bailiff for Thomas de Erdinton, Sheriff of Shropshire. As such he was cited in 1218 by the Barons of the Exchequer, to account on behalf of his deceased employer.68 I cannot associate Robert de Shireford with Lye Hall by any direct evidence. He was clearly the person of whose injustice the Burgesses of Brug were complaining at the Assizes of 1221, as already stated.69 A Fine was levied at Westminster on May 2, 1232, between Mabel, Widow of Richard Kene, Plaintiff, and Thomas de Shereford, Tenant, of a third of a carucate in Legh, which Mabel claimed as dower, and whereof was suit at law. Mabel now relinquishes her claim ; for which Thomas gives her three acres in Legh, lying upon Ludebroc, to hold for life by way of dower, with remainder to himself. He also pays her six merks in money.70 At the Inquisition of 1255, Thomas de Syreford was one of the Tenants within the Liberty of Brug who was not in due attendance.71 The Fine above quoted is curiously supplemented by a cause tried at Salop Assizes in January 1256.72 \u2014 \" Susanna atte Legh, with Alice and Matilda, her Sisters, sue Thomas de Schireford for one-third of a carucate in Legh, which they claim as their right, and wherein Thomas hath no ingress save by intrusion, which he made therein after the death of Matilda atte Legh,73 who held the same in dower of the gift of Richard Fitz Fulco7i her former husband and Grandfather of the three Plaintiffs, who assert themselves to be his heirs.\" The Defendant's plea was an allegation of the Plaintiffs' illegitimacy, a matter which, as usual in such cases, was left to the investigation of the Diocesan Court, and the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry was to certify the result by Letters Patent. At the same Assizes, Hugh de Dodemanston sued Thomas de Shyreford for a whole carucate, except three acres in La Legh ; but the parties accorded, and \" had their Cyrograph.\" 73 68 Memoranda, 2 Hen.

Hugh acknowledges the right of Thomas, for which the latter pays him thirteen merks. An indorsement on the Fine states that \" Robert de Dudemaneston opposes his claim.\" This Fine seems to have been preparatory to another, levied, apparently on the same day, between \" Hawyse de Shyrinton Complainant, and Master Thomas de Shyreford, Deforciant, of one messuage and one carucate in La Legh, whereof was Plea of Con vention. Thomas acknowledged the right of Hawyse, whereupon the latter made the following settlement. She conceded the premises to Thomas for his life, \u2014 to hold of herself for her life ; \u2014 rendering one merk per annum in the Church of Quatte, and performing, for Hawyse, all services to the Lord of the Fee. After death of Thomas, the premises to revert to Hawyse for life, \u2014 rendering one halfpenny rent to Thomas's heirs, and performing all capital services. \u2014 OnHawyse's death, remainder to Ralph her son, and the heirs of his body lawfully begotten ; \u2014 to hold under the heirs of Thomas, by the same rent and services. \u2014 Similar Remainders to Richard, William, and Robert, brothers of Ralph, in succession, \u2014 and in default of bodily heirs of each in turn.

View of the premises was ordered by the Court, and the case adjourned to the morrow of Ascension Day.79 Later in the same Term I find Matilda Atte-Lcg, Ichenard de Brug, and Alice his wife, making Susanna, the Sister of Matilda and Alice, their Attorney in the suit which they had against Hawys de Shyreford concerning dower?0 Here, though the suit is incorrectly described as one of dower, we have no difficulty in recognizing the parties thereto under their change of name ; and it is obvious that the three Sisters, Susanna, Alice, and Matilda, were the same who, as Grand-children of Richard Fitz Fulco, had three years before sued Thomas de Shireford for the same premises, and who, though then their legitimacy was in question, had since proved it, and were now in possession. The loss of Records prevents my following this subject as I could have wished. I must therefore be content to say what else I find of its other branches. In March 1259, special Justices are appointed to try a suit of novel disseizin, wherein Master Thomas de Shireford had impleadcd Thomas le Turnur, his wife Susanna, and others, concerning a tenement in Legh Shireford. Again, in October of the same year, Justices are appointed to try a suit of novel disseizin, which Thomas Forster and Susanna his wife had against Hugh de Dodemanston concerning a tenement in La Leye.81 A long period now elapses, in which I find nothing relating to this member of the Dudmaston estate. I cannot discover the Fine whereby Matthew, Rector of the Church of Roshale (probably only a Trustee), is said to have enfeoffed Henry de Mortimer of Chel marsh and Constance his wife conjointly, in certain tenements in the Lye Hall, held under Hugh de Dodmaston.83 However, as I have before stated, the said Henry held the same in tail at the period of his death (October 1317).

It does not, like Chelmarsh and Quat, appear to have lapsed to De Cressi. Some other Under-Tenants, or Connections of the Lords of Quat and Dudmaston, I must notice in order of their occurrence. The names most prominent are Dudmaston, Euledon (or Wheldon), and le Someneur. Robert de Quatte was assessed under Regard of Morf Forest in 1209. In 1255, Ralph de Mose and John his son have already occurred.83 In 1262, John Burel of Quat, Richard, son of Robert de Mose, and Henry Geri of Mose are on the List entitled \" Essonia Mortis \" in the Forest Assizes of that year : Adam Sprot and Geoffrey Geri are Essoignors; Geoffrey Geri and William de Quat ford of Mose are fined for vert. The injuries which two Brothers, Richard and Philip de Dud maston, received at the hands of the Under-Sheriff of Shropshire iu 1273-4, have already been detailed.8* Was this Richard the same person as ]\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 hard de Dodemoneston who was Bailiff of Pimhill Hundred in September 1272? If so, his own extortionate conduct was matter of complaint at the Inquest of 1274.85 On Feb. 11, 1275, William de Euledone was on a Jury at Astley. On Sept. 19, 1304, Hugh le Somenour and William de Euledon were on a Jury at Brug. On April 17, 1305, Hugh le Somyneur of Mose, Henry le Fremon of Mose, and William de Eweldon, sat on another Jury at Brug. On Nov. 5, 1313, Bertram, son of William de Egweledone, grants to William le Forcer, Knight, two-thirds of a Messuage and virgate in Dodemonston, with reversion of the lands which Christiana Boghan then held in dower, all which he (Bertram) had of the gift and feoffment of Thomas, son of John le Taylour of Brug;\u2014 to hold of the chief Lords of the Fee.86 On Oct. 24, 1322, William de Egweledon occurs as a landowner in Dudmaston, and attests a Dudmaston deed with Emeric le Taylour and Hugh le Cartere. 83 Vol. I, p. 306.

The first notice which I have of a Church here was probably much later than its Foundation. I have already stated how in 1255 it was valued at ten merks per annum, and was in the gift of the Prior of Malvern. The same Valuation is given in 1291, for this Church, as situated in the Staffordshire Deanery of Lapley and Trysul, and the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry.88 In the Inquisition of 1341, I find no other allusion to this Parish than that which has already been given.89 In 1534, John Savage being Parson of Quatt, his preferment, in glebe, Easter dues, offerings, great and small tithes, was valued at \u00a31_. 18s. 6d. per annum. The charges thereon were a Pension of 20s. payable to the Prior of Malvern ; 2*., each third year, payable to the Bishop of Chester; and 11s. 8^., for procurations, payable to the Archdeacon of Stafford.90 The Prior of Malvern makes a separate acknowledgment of his Pension : which is also noticed in the Ministers' Accounts of 1542-3,91 as an asset of the dissolved Priory.

Romsley thus became a member of the Fief which these Barons held in capite of the Crown. Again, the Tenants of the Barons of Richard's Castle at Romsley were the successive Representatives of a Knightly race called Puer, or Le Poer, but whose name is found written with numberless other variations.3 This family held largely under the See of Wor cester; and an attempt to trace its origin and branches would involve me to an unreasonable extent in the History of another County. Suffice it then here to say, that Hugh Puher, who in 1165 held two and a half Knights'-fees under the Bishop of Worcester,3 was probably Osbern Fitz Hugh's immediate tenant at Romsley. Hence in 1167, when Alan de Nevill, holding an Assize of the Forest in Staffordshire, inflicted a fine of half a merk on the Vill of Romsley, the place is entered upon the Record as Rameslea Hugonis* I have seen cotemporary mention of Hugh le Puhier in more certain connection with Shropshire affairs ; but of that elsewhere. In 1176, the King, having held Pleas of the Forest in Worcester shire, had amerced Hugh Puher in a sum of twenty merks.5 Between the years 1186 and 1190, a Charter by Hugh de Say (then Baron of Richard's Castle), in favour of Matilda, daughter of John Puher, of Bispestune, is attested by Roger le Puher and William his Brother.; 6 but I cannot affirm that either of the latter persons was Mesne Lord of Romsley. Such, more probably, was Sir Walter le Poer, one of the four Knights who, in Easter Term 1200, were concerned as Jurors in a trial which I have mentioned under Nordley.7 1 Domesday, so. 239, a. 2.

In 1255, William le Poer was Mesne Lord of Romsley, as will appear presently. In 1274, Roger le Peuer is returned as holding one fee in Bag geshovere and Rumisley, of the Barony of Richard's Castle, and the value of the Tenure is estimated at \u201e\u00a312.10 On Aug. 15, 1287, Roger le Pouer is returned as having held the (joint) Manor of Rommesley and Baggeshovere, of \u00a312 annual value, by service of one Knight's-fee, under Robert de Mortimer, late Lord of Richard's Castle.11 In 1292 and 1294, John le Power is mentioned as Mesne Lord of Romsley in the Inquisitions on the deaths of Bishop Burnel and his Nephew Philip. On March 11, 1307, Leo de Rommeslegh is returned as having held Romsley and Badger by one Knight's fee, under Matilda, the lately deceased Widow of Hugh de Mortimer of Richard's Castle.12 Again, on the death of Edward Burnell in 1315, Roger le Pouwer is named as Mesne Lord of Romsley. Thus far of the somewhat obscure succession of those who are presumed to have held Romsley immediately under the Barons of Richard's Castle. The Under-Tenants of Le Poer were at one time persons of the same name, and probably a younger branch of the famdy. As however I can give no genealogical or connected account of this branch, I shall only put down in order of time such notices as I have of all Under-Tenants indifferently. At Salop Assizes, October 1203, Ralph de Ramesleg essoigns himself by William de Ramesleg in a suit of mort d'ancestre which Richard Fitz Fulco had against him.

The latter questioning the Plaintiff's Legitimacy, the usual reference was ordered to the Bishop of the Diocese.13 We have heard of Richard Fitz Fulco, under Lye Hall, and how his Grand-daughters' heirship was questioned fifty years afterwards on similar grounds.14 The cause above mentioned was still unsettled in Michaelmas Term 1206, when, at Westminster, Ralph de Ramesleg essoigns himself in the Plea of Bastardy which he had against Richard Senell.15 It was at length settled by fine, levied at Westminster, Oct. 6, 1207, between Richard Fitz Fulco, Plaintiff, and Ralph Fitz William, Tenant, of one virgate in Rammesle, whereof was recognition of mort d'ancestre. \u2014 Ralph acknowledged the right of Richard, and the latter conceded a quarter of the premises to Ralph, excepting the capital messuage, saving also small parcels in the fields of Sandstiele and Estfield, and the wood called Castelgrene, and in the field called Coldray, and a messuage, late Robert Clarembald's, without Col dray. Ralph and his heirs are to hold of Richard and his heirs by service of \\8d. rent, and by doing all foreign services which attach to the said quarter of a virgate.\" 16 Again this Fine was disputed or disregarded ; for, in Michaelmas Term 1213, I find Ralph Fitz William essoigned by William Fitz Ralph, in a Plea of Fine levied (de placito finis facti), which the former had against Richard Snel.17 At Shrewsbury Assizes, November 1221, Robert le Franceis being dead, a suit of mort d'ancestre, which he had arraigned against Richard de la Vestene and Agnes his Mother, concerning a virgate in Remesleg, was postponed.18 However, I find else where what I doubt not to be a settlement of the matter : \u2014 On Nov. 12, 1221, Agnes Fitz Robert, being Plaintiff against Richard Fitz John and Agnes de Wascon, concerning half a virgate in Ramesleg, remits her right to Richard and Agnes, and the heirs of Richard, for which the latter paid her 10s.19 In Michaelmas Term 1240, Edith de Remesle sued Geoffrey le Poer, for disseizing her of a third part of a virgate in Remesle. 18 Salop Assizes, 5 John, m. 1 and 6. 14 Supra, p. 191.

The Jury found as follows :\u2014 that Richard le Waleys, who formerly held the land iu fee, made it o-er to William Bunibrok, Walter's father, as Tenant-at-Will, at 8s. rent; that John, son and heir of Richard le Waleys, continued that arrangement ; and that, on John's death, his three Sisters and heirs gave the land to Richard le Archer with Margery his wife. Again, on William Bunibrok's death, his son Walter fined with Archer, that he might hold the virgate at the old rent. Walter, finding that his Mother and he could not dwell together, subsequently made over to her a third of the premises. But when Geoffrey, the present Defendant, became enfeoffed in the land, he seized the whole, and had since leased half thereof to Walter Bunibrok, at the old rent of the whole (8s.). Edith hereupon acknowledged the title of Geoffrey, for which Geoffrey conceded to her a third of the land, to hold for life, at the rent of a third part of 8s.20 A Fine was levied at Gloucester, July 15, 1241, between Geoffrey le Poer, Plaintiff, and Richard le Archer and Margery his wife, Defendants (impedientes) of two virgates in Ramesleg, whereof was Plea of Warranty of Charter.

The Plaintiff (or, in other words, the Purchaser) paid them twenty merks.21 In Trinity Term, 1250, we are again reminded of a former Tenant of Romsley ; for Agnes, Widow of Richard Snel, is then a Suitor at Westminster against Laurence de Anneford, for her dower, viz., a third part of a carucate in Remesleg. The Defendant asked View thereof, and so the Cause was adjourned.23 In 1255, the Jurors of Brug reported that John le Poer held Remesle, which contained a hide and-half, under William le Poer, by service of providing one-fifth of a Knight's-fee for the said Sir William ; and he (John) did suit to the Hundred of Brug.33 20 Placita, 24, 25 Hen.

October 21, 1259, a special Commission issued to certain Justices, to try a prosecution, wherein John de Estleg (Astley) was suing Lyonius, Parson of Kinver, about a stank, injuriously erected by the latter in Romesleg.2* Here is the clearest notice which I have met with of the indi vidual usually called Lyonius de Romsley; and who, though a Clerk, was apparently possessed of a good estate, and whose secular habits are still more strongly indicated by his being Father of two Sons, who appear on very many public occasions. It is not quite clear to me how many of this name came in succession; I can only therefore put down names and events in the same order as I find them. \" Leulinus, son of Leulinus,\" was Under-Sheriff to Hamo le Strange, and under that name and capacity was, in 1276, pre sented by the Jurors of Offlow Hundred (Staffordshire), for two acts of tyranny.25 \u2014 Now, Hamo le Strange had the Counties of Stafford and Salop committed to him on August 10, 1263, and the Castles of Salop, Brug, and Montgomery, on Nov. 22, 1263. He was supplanted in his Custody of the Counties on June 4, 1264, and ordered to give up the Castles on August 24, and again on December 20th, of the same year. I have before pointed out the certain illegality and the probable inefficiency of these last orders. I have also shown how Hamo le Strange appeared at the account of Michaelmas 1267 as the recog nized Sheriff of that and several preceding years.26 Leonius, son of Leonius de Romsley, was therefore Under- Sheriff between the years 1263 and 1267, and at that critical period was perhaps also zealous in the same political cause which was so warmly espoused by his Superior. Hence, I suppose, came those subsequent marks of distinction which seem to have eclipsed the suspected irregularity of his birth. In 1269, the King allowed Leoneus de Romesleg to impark his wood of Horwood within Kinver Forest.27 24 Pat. 43 Hen. Ill, dorso.

Still following events with reference to time rather than persons, I should here state, that at the County Assizes of Autumn 1272, John de Romeslegh (whose real name was, I think, Le Poer) officiated as a Juror of Stottesden Hundred. Also William, son of Walter de Overton, sued Peter, son of \" Leoninus de Remesleg,\" for two messuages and a virgate in Remesleg, saying that Peter had no ingress therein except by the disseizin which Walter, William's Father, had wrought upon said William. Peter obtained sentence, on the ground that Walter had enfeoffed him.38 John le Poer occurs as a Juror of Stottesden Hundred on Nov. 30, 1274, and on an Astley Jury, Feb. 21, 1275. About this time too he is a witness of more than one undated Deed as John le Poer, or John le Pouwer, de Remesle. In the Shropshire Assessment of the tax of the Fifteenth, levied in 1275, the name of Leonius, son of Leonius, occurs ; \u2014 I think, as having been intrusted with part of the receipts.29 In 1277, \"Leonius, son of Leonius,\" and Richard de Wyco, had received \u00a360. from the Sheriff of Shropshire, by order of the King. They account for the expenditure of that money in the Kings's affairs.30 In 1286, there seems to have been an Inquest as to the propriety of allowing Leonius, son of Leonius, to assart twenty acres within the Manor of Kinver.31 Leonius, son of Leonius de Ramesle, served as Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire from May 3, 1286, till about June 1288. His office probably determined with his life; for in the latter year I find an order to the Escheator citra Trent to seize into the King's hands, the lands and tenements which had belonged to Leonius Fitz Leo nius, deceased.32 In 1307, however, another Leo de Romesley has already occurred to us, as Mesne-Lord of this Manor. How he acquired it, or any- Bobbington, if I give the names of some of the Jurors on this occasion. They were Hugh de Wrottesley, Henry de Morf, Richard de Evenefeud, John son of Adam de Lutteley, Geoffrey de la Broke, Tho mas de Lutteley, William de Overton, and John de Tresel. (Vide supra, pp. 169-171.) (page 7) gives Lyamis {perhaps Lyonius) deRomersleg as Sheriff in 2 Edw. I (1274), and John Baril as Under-Sheriff. On what authority this statement rests we are not told.

Meantime, Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was making acquisitions in Romsley. In January 1290, a Fine was levied between the said Bishop, Complainant, and William de Bueles, Deforciant, of half a messuage, 54 acres of land, and 12d. rent, in Remmeslegh, whereof was plea of convention. William gave up the premises, to be held by the Plaintiff, of the Lords of the Fee. The Bishop is said to pay him for this with a Sore Sparrow-Hawk.33 Again, in January 1291, another fine was levied of the same premises, evidently in consequence of the former Deforciant' s title being found imperfect. He was, in fact, only Tenant for life. This second fine is between the Bishop and William son of William de Bueles, and of the same premises, which, says the Record, \" William de Bueles holds for life, by Law of England aud of the inheritance of William, son of William aforesaid.\" The Deforciant now re nounces his claim, aster his father's death, the Bishop again being said to give a Sore Sparrow-Hawk. \" This Concord was made in presence of William de Bueles (Senior), who allowed it, and sur rendered the premises.\" 3* Hence the Inquisition, on the death of the Bishop in December ] 292, says, that he held \" 34s. rent in Romesleye of John le Power, by service of 2s. and of one pound of cumin,\" such being, I sup pose, the chief-rent due on his previous purchase. A similar statement was made on the death of Philip Burnell, the Bishop's heir ; and in 1315 the Estate of Edward Burnell, deceased, in Romeslegh, is defined as a messuage and virgate held of Roger le Pouwer.35 I conclude this subject of the Under-tenants of Romsley with mention of Giles and Hugh le Poer, who occur on local Juries in September 1304 and February 1305 ; also of Hugh le Pouer, who is similarly employed at Bruges on April 17, 1305; and of Giles le Poer, similarly employed March 23, 1310. ROMSLEY CHAPEL. Romsley is in the Parish of Alveley, and the Chapel which once existed here was consequently an affiliation of Alveley Church, and subject to that Prebend of St. Mary Magdalene of Bridgnorth, to which the Mother Church belonged. Hence a notice of the year 3334 PedesFinium, 18.19 Edw.I, Salop. 35 Inquisitions, 21 Edw. I, No. 50 ; 22 Edw. I, No. 45, c. ; 9 Edw.

Of course, under these circumstances, we can expect to find no connected notice of any Incumbents or Chaplains of Romsley. The officiating Priest was probably at no time more than a mere Deputy, employed or removed at will of the Cotemporary Prebendary of Alveley. The situation of this Chapel can still be identified by the remains of its foundatiou aud of the encaustic tiles which once formed its floor. Two Stones, part of the head of a doorway, are still to be seen, built into the wall of an adjacent stable. They are carved with the zodiacal signs Leo and Sagittarius, and probably belonged to a series of twelve such stones. &UtfCJt, This name is derived from the Saxon word Hpyc3, \u2014 a ridge.

The next notice which I have of Rudge marks its proximity to the Royal Forest of Morf. The Justices of the Forest, visiting Staffordshire in 1188, fined the vill of Rugge half a merk for an oak-tree which had been felled without license.* In June 1194, William de Ruge, apparently a Knight, was one of the four Visors appointed to ascertain the validity of an essoign, in a case often alluded to before.5 At Michaelmas 1197, William de Rigge is mentioned as having fined one merk, that the suit which was between him and Geoffrey de Ledewic might be carried into the King's Court. We shall pre sently see the family of Ledwich concerned in Rudge. William de Rigge's fine was not fully paid till a.d. 1200.6 At the Forest Assizes, in March 1209, I find William de la Rugge fining half a merk, that the farm-building (boveria) which he had erected on his own land at Sutton might not be removed.7 About this time William de Rugge was a Benefactor to Haugh mond Abbey. He gave the Canons 12d. rent, which Richard Ornath of the Heath paid for certain land. This he did for the souls' health of himself and his wife Mabel.8 Eudo de Rugge, who has already occurred to us about 1227,9 was probably of this place. In or about 1240, Geoffrey de Ledwiz is said to hold a Knight's fee in Ruge under Mortimer of Wigmore.10 Of him I shall have future occasion to speak, under Ledwich and Abdon. His interest at Rudge seems to have been transitory, perhaps owing to the fol lowing difference which occurred between his son, another Geoffrey, and Roger de Mortimer. \u2014 In Michaelmas Term, 1253, that Baron is suing Geoffrey de Ledewyz, \"that he should perform customs and services due on the free tenement which he holds of him in Rugge, as in Homages and 4 Rot.

September 15, 1257, a cause of novel disseizin had been arraigned by Nicholas de Ruge against Ralph Basset of Drayton, concerning a tenement in Ruge.13 Nicholas de Rugge appears on the Shropshire Pipe Roll of 1258, as fining half-a-merk \" to have an assize.\" It was obviously for the Plea just set forth. Though Rudge would, on some grounds, appear to have been accounted in Brimstree Hundred at this period, its state in ordinary will have been extra-hundredal. It was, in short, one of those Manors whose Suit had been attracted to the King's Court at Cla verley ; and after that arrangement was broken through, it and Shipley were annexed to Stottesden Hundred. Claverley and Whittimere however, which lie South of Rudge and Shipley, and so cut the two latter off from any other Stottesden Manor, have now fallen to Brimstree Hundred. The causes of these anomalies are very ancient, and will appear in our further account of Rudge. \u2014 Before October 1272, Nicholas de Rugg was deceased, and at the Assizes then held, the Claverley Jurors represented how his Son and Heir William was then a Minor, in ward to Roger de Mortimer (of Wigmore) ; how also Nicholas de Rugg used to do Suit twice a year to the King's Court of Claverle till seven years since, when said Roger withdrew the Suit, whereby the King was damaged to the extent of Is. per annum. The seven years thus indicated bring us to a period two months later than the Battle of Evesham. It was unquestionably the loyalty and power of Mortimer which had decided the fortune of that day ; and one mode in which he remunerated himself for his services was by various encroachments on the prerogative of the Crown and the rights of other subjects. At the Inquisition of 1274 the Claverley Jurors renewed their complaint about Roger de Mortimer's withdrawal of the Suit of Shipley and Rudge from the Court of Claverley, and how the King 11 Placita, 37 Hen.

I have mentioned under Claverley several matters which concerned William Lord of Rudge, at the Assizes of 1292. The Claverley Jurors also showed how Suit of their Court had been withdrawn, twenty-seven years before, by Roger de Mortimer to his Manor of Cleybury. The Sheriff was hereupon ordered to summon William Lord of Rudge, and Edmund de Mortimer, son and heir of Roger. Mortimer's plea appears to have depended on that Charter of Henry III which exempted Cleobury and Chelmarsh, with their members, from all Suits of Courts. Hugh de Louther, the King's Attorney, here asked that judgment should be given, whether this Charter, made to a different person (person\u00e6 extrane\u00e6) from the actual Defendant (William de Rudge), should prevent the King now reigning, from recovering the aforesaid Suit, since William de Rudge could not deny that Henry III had been seized of the said Suit. The Court decided that the parties should have sentence at Lich field on the Quinzaine of Hilary (Jan. 1293) A I find nothing more of this. Meantime, that is at Shrewsbury in October, the King pro secuted Edmund de Mortimer under two distinct Writs of Quo Waranto. The first16 was as to his right of holding Pleas of the Crown, and having weyfin Shepple, Ruge, and thirty other Manors. To save a future reiteration of this question as regards other Manors, 1 will here detail what took place concerning Shipley and Rudge. \u2014 Edmund de Mortimer pleaded in his justification, Henry Ill's Charter to his Father, which exempted Cleobury (Mortimer) and Chelmarsh, with all their members and appurtenances, from tallages, suits of County and Hundred, and other Customs belonging to the King. Being asked whether he himself held the Vills which he called members of Cleobury, he said that they were held of his 13 Mot. Bund. II, 90. p. 323, note. 14 Originalia, Vol. I, p. 59.

Hugh de Louther here objected that the King's Charter extended to nothing, except what Roger de Mortimer held in demesne (in dominico),18 and that Shipley and Rudge &c. were not so held. Specially, with regard to Shipley and Rudge, he added, that they were not members of Cleobury Mortimer, and as to that issue, he appealed, on behalf of the Crown, to a Jury. The Jury found upon oath, that they were members of Cleobury Mortimer, in which I suppose that the said Jury was altogether wrong, though their Verdict seems, so far, to have settled the matter. The King's other Writ of Quo Waranto against Edmund de Mortimer was, as regarded Shipley and Rudge, to question his right of withdrawing the Suit thereof from the King's County of Salop and the King's Hundred of Brimstree (Brunestrete) . It happened that Sir Peter Corbet of Caus had just been impleaded by the Crown for a host of similar withdrawals, and had questioned the law of the prosecution on technical grounds, and with success. Edmund de Mortimer availed himself of this, and challenged the King's Writ against himself as similarly invalid. The Crown Pro secutor replied as in Corbet's case, and the Judges decided similarly, viz., that, whereas it was competent to the King to have sued Mor timer under a writ more in accordance with the common law than the one now adopted, the Defendant should be dismissed sine die, as regarded the present Writ, and that the King's right should be reserved &c, (that is, if he should choose to prosecute under another form).19 At the Assizes of 1292, Sarra, Prioress of St. Leonard's of Bre wood, sued Wdliam Lord of Rugge for disseizing her of a right of common in an acre of pasture at Rugge. William pleaded \u2014 first, that the pasture was in Claverley, not in Rugge ; secondly, that the Prioress was his Tenant, and tnat he had only availed himself of the Statute, which allowed him to improve his estate provided sufficient common were left to his Tenants elsewhere. The Jury found that the pasture was in Rugge; that it was a Royal acre, and contained more than ten acres ; that if the Prioress had had access to other pasture every year, such as she had to this every third year, she would have enough ; but that owing to William's having \u00ab 18 We may here mark the essential I nium and dominieum. difference between the two words domi- \\ 19 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 681."], [247, "209 SHIPLEY. enclosed this acre, and keeping it closed two years out of three, she had no such sufficiency. William was therefore in misericordid. At the same Assizes, Wdliam de Rugge impleaded the same Prioress and others for destroying his boundary-fence in Rugge ; but the Defendants had a Verdict.20 An Inquisition held at Shrewsbury Feb. 10, 1305, found William de Rugge to have held of Edmund de Mortimer, then deceased, by service of one Knight's-fee.21 In March 1316, William de Rugg was returned as Lord of Rugg, in Stottesden Hundred ; 33 but when the Manor came to be so annexed I cannot determine. In that Hundred however it still remains. ftjjip-Up* Wulfric Spott, the munificent Founder of Burton Abbey, is said to have given lands thereto in Remesleage, Sciplea, and Suth tune.1 Those places, which are mentioned consecutively in his Will, have not, I believe, been otherwise identified than as Romsley, Shipley, and Sutton (near Claverley) ; \u2014 all in Shropshire. This matter belongs to the very beginning of the eleventh Century, and the statement is by no means invalidated by the absence of cor roborative testimony. The \u00e6ra is too ancient to expect such tests ; and we must be content to say that, if the grant was originally made, we find no evidence of Burton Abbey maintaining any such interest in Shropshire. The Warwickshire Domesday notices this Manor next to Rudge, and in the following terms \u2022? \u2014 \" The same Radulfus holds of the Earl (Roger de Montgomery) i hide in Sciplei.

The Manor is worth 5s. (per annum). Alsi held it freely in time of King Edward.\" In the twelfth century, there is much probability that Shipley was held under Mortimer of Wigmore, by a branch of that family of Savage which I have said so much of under Eudon George. In April 1200, Richard Salvage, a Knight and Juror in the cause of Grand Assize, mentioned under Nordley Regis,4 was, I doubt not, Lord of Shipley. The same person attests the Charter of William de Rudge to Haughmond Abbey, which I have set forth and assigned to an early part of the thirteenth Century. We are told, and perhaps truly, that one Robert le Salvage gave Shipley to Adam Malveisin, a scion of the House seated at Mavesyn Ridware, in Staffordshire.5 This will have been before the year 1240, when it is certain that Adam Mauveisin was holding a third part of a Knight's Fee in Shiple, under Ralph Mortimer of Wig more.6 Adam Malveisin's Succession at Shipley seems to have been for a time interrupted ; but whether in consequence of some minority, or other more substantive cause, I cannot say. Though one Adam de Schipleg sat as a Juror on the Claverley Inquest of 1255, that Jury returned William de Mortimer as Lord of the Vill. The said William \" held i hide in Schipleg, in the Manor of Claverley, by service of doing suit to the Court of Claverley thrice in a year, and (oftener) in the way of afforciament if a King's Writ, ordering any trial, was before the Court.\" 7 In what relation this William de Mortimer8 stood to the then Baron of Wigmore I will not venture here to say. At the Assizes of January 1256, the Claverley Jurors presented him as a Defaulter in due attendance. Between Adam Malveisin of 1240 and Roger Malveisin, a Minor of 1272, there came one Robert Malveisin l, father of Roger; and I 4 Supra, p. 157. which he himself quotes, but is in many instances contradictory thereto, and at variance with other testimony. 5 Shaw, I, 171. Shaw makes Sir Adam Malveisin to have been the eldest son of Sir Henry Malveisin, Lord of Mavesyn Ridware. Shaw thinks that Sir Adam died in his Father's lifetime, without issue, so that Sir Henry was eventually succeeded by his second son, Sir Robert. This is entirely apocryphal ; indeed the whole of Shaw's account of this descent is not only not borne out by the evidences 0 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 7 Rot. Hund. II, 61.

At Michaelmas 1259, Robert Mauveysin (probably a young man) was owing the King half a merk of gold, which fine he had prof fered in the previous year, that his obligation to take Knighthood might be respited.9 At the Assizes of September 1272, the Claverley Jurors reported that Robert Mauvesyn (father of Roger, then under age, and in ward to Roger de Mortimer) used to do suit to the King's Court of Claverley twice per annum, till seven years back ; that Roger de Mortimer had now withdrawn the suit of Scipleg, to the loss of the King of Is. per annum. The sequel of this question of Suit has been detailed under Rudge, where, mutatis mutandis, may be found the whole of what transpired in regard to the cognate tenure of Shipley. In October 1292, Henry Mauveysin was that Lord of Shyppeley who stood side by side with William Lord of Rudge in the said matter. An Inquest, which sat at Shrewsbury on Feb. 10, 1305, after death of Edmund de Mortimer of Wigmore, found this same Henry Mauveysin to be holding a third part of a Knight's-Fee at Schipley, under the late Baron's Fief.10 On April 28, 1305, a Jury, which had been summoned by the King's order, sat at Claverley, and found that the King might, without injury to himself, grant eight acres of waste in Claverley to Henry Mauveisin ; \u2014 to hold to said Henry and his heirs by a certain rent payable at the Exchequer by the hand of the Bailiff of Claverley. Each acre, said the Jurors, was worth 3d. per annum.11 In the same year Henry Mauveisin fined 4s. for ingress into the said eight acres, and had Letters-Patent conveying the same to him and his heirs at an annual rent of 2s. 8d.li The Feodary of March 1316 gives John Mauveysin as Lord of Shipley, in Stottesden Hundred.13 With him I quit this fragmentary notice of a branch of that great house of Mauveysin whose connection with Shropshire must on a future occasion come under more extended review. 9 Rot.

The Severn itself was in one place a land-locked and sluggish stream ; in another a series of rivulets struggling on, with no concentrated force, amid the various impedi ments which uncontrolled nature had crowded on its course. Its fits of wintry and swollen fury, like human passions, reacted upon themselves ; for the giant oak, which to-day was torn from its bank and plunged in the torrent, lay on the morroAr athwart the subsiding stream, an additional element of its future bondage. The Region, whose chief features I thus imagine, seems to have been known to the Britons as Coed, or forest, \u2014 the forest, that is, par excellence of this part of England. When we read of the Forests of Morf, Kinver, and Wyre, we get notions of extent which must be added one to the other before we can realize any idea of the more ancient Coed ; for the Coed was the parent of the other three, and they perhaps not its only constituents. I am now to speak of Morf Forest more particularly, and, though I cannot indicate the precise time at which it was separated from its associates, we shall not err in ascribing the change to an increasing population, and the Saxon devotion to agriculture. In the earliest stage of its self-existence, Morf Forest can be ascer tained to have been at least eight miles in length, while its greatest width was more problematically about six. Its known, because after wards maintained, Northern boundary rested upon the Worf, for some miles before that stream falls into the Severn. Its South eastern extremity is determined by its name, taken from the Stafford-"], [251, "213 MORE FOREST. shire Village of Morf, where commenced that interval which gradual change had interposed between the Forests of Morf and Kinver. By still further compression of its southern boundaries, and by large clearances within its area, Morf Forest had, at the Normau Conquest, been altered both in extent and character. But the Forest ground, though alternated with cornfields and villages, was still very great, and very great it remained for more than two Centuries afterwards. It is remarkable that, in contemplating the district which is gene rally recognized as Morf Forest, we should meet with some memento of every nation which has figured in English History : \u2014 Britain, Roman, Saxon, Dane, and Norman. \u2014 For each people there is some monument or association, some word, some fact, or some idea to connect it with the district. We have the British Coed represented by the Saxon form, Quat, and applied, on the one hand, to a village settlement within the Forest, on another to a ford on its outskirts.1 On the table-land of Morf there were in the last century several Tumuli, now levelled by the plough, but held by good authority to have been British.3 If the Walls at Chesterton were originally a British work, the very name of Chesterton implies a Roman occupation, and Stratford brook thereby owes its name to a Roman Road (stratum) which crossed it. Morf Forest was visited too by the Danes, not, I mean, when Mercia was generally their Conquest, but iu later times, when, out man\u0153uvred by Alfred on the Thames and deprived of their fleet, they sought refuge for their army in this wilderness, looking doubt less to the great river aud the primeval forest as probable means of regaining their more natural home, the Sea. \u2014 At Burs Castle, eastward of Quatford, the Danes lay intrenched for oue winter.3 Unfed by the Forest, their frequent raids west 1 Quat (the Quatone of Domesday) and Quatford. tent of this earth- work, when compared with the needs of a Danish army. His doubt may, I think, be set at rest, both as a question of the strength and time em ployed upon this work. The numerical force of the Danish army, which took refuge in Morf-Forest, doe3 not appear ; but I do not see why it should be ac counted to have been great. It was pro bably more formidable from its quality and organization than its numbers. On the other hand, we know that the Danes 2 Hartshorne (Salopia Antiqua, pp. 99 101). 3 I will not appropriate Mr. Harts home's reasons (Salopia Antiqua, pp.211, 212) for determining on Burs Castle as the site of the Danish encampment, further than to express my concurrence therein, and to attempt a removal of the only doubt which he entertained on the sub ject, viz., the apparently inadequate ex-"], [252, "214 MORF FOREST. ward, across the Severn, are imaged by simple reason rather than by conjectural fancy. What wonder then if the affrighted Saxon of the district noted well the point of the Northmen's passage, and spoke of it afterwards to his children as the \" Danes-ford.\" This was at the close of the ninth century, but before the middle of the eleventh the agricultural Saxon had made great inroads on the Forest. Eight Settlements at least had sprung up within the more ancient limits of Morf, and four of these (Claverley, Worfield, Nordley, and Alveley) were held in demesne, if not originated, by the Earls of Mercia. Of the first Norman Earl of Shropshire, his preddections for Morf Forest and for Quatford, we have heard enough already. The site of his Castle on the Severn is stdl apparent ; the very stones of his Collegiate Church point not only to its Norman Founder, but tell how vainly in this region had nature been contending against civilization ; for the River by which those stones came to Quatford had become a high-road of commerce thence downwards to the Bristol Channel. So then in Morf Forest the dynasty of nature gave wayFto the dynasty of man ; and wheu man had the upper hand, still there was change marked even within the Forest by the conflict of races. \u2014 Patriotism, Civilization, Military Science, patient industry, ad venturous barbarism, Superstition, Chivalry, and Religion, \u2014 all these played their parts in Morf Forest ;- \u2014 and the ultimate ascendency was with the Norman. As it was in the Forest so is it in the World and with individuals : \u2014 that nation or man who can sustain, really or affectedly, the greatest number of these parts together, shall ever have a temporal pre-eminence. I must pass from a great subject to petty detads, \u2014 from Morf Forest as the theatre of vast changes to Morf Forest as a favourite Chace of English Kings. Some of these details have already been given. A few further particulars will not be uninteresting to the local Antiquary. At the Forest Assize of 1180 the Vill of Claverley was amerced 6s. 8d. for waste, Reginald Buncki of Claverley was fined Is. for pur presture, and two other residents there paid 3s. for an imbladement. In the year 1208 a regular annual assessment of 4s. 4d. was settled remained in this quarter only one winter, a period insufficient for the completion of any extensive fortification, even had such structures been congenial with their roving habits. They probably came here with the purpose of building a sleet, but finding that, when built, it could not begot down the Severn, they abandoned their design."], [253, "215 MORF FOREST. on certain persons within Regard of Morf Forest. This sum the Sheriff accounts for more or less regularly on the Pipe Rolls till the year 1273, subsequently to which I have taken no note on the subject. This payment is sometimes entered as \"ferm of the Forest of Worfield and Claverley,\" sometimes as \" for minute purprestures in Claverley,\" or \" for minute parcels of forest in Claverley.\" It was in fact a fixed arrentation of certain purprestures in Morf Forest. At the Forest Assizes of 1209 I see no entry under the Regard of Morf Forest which needs mention here. Alan Forester of Claver ley was assessed 6d. for recent purpresture of one acre in Norley. On Oct. 21, 1235, a Writ of Henry III orders the Sheriff of Shrop shire, on such day as John de Nevill, Chief Forester and Justice of all the Forests of England, shall appoint, to take four Knights of the County, and, first going with them before the said Justice, after wards proceed to view all the Forests of the said County. The Sheriff was further to report in writing to the King the state in which the said Justice, Sheriff, and Knights found each Forest. The Knights thus commissioned were Odo de Hodnet, Geoffrey de Overton, Robert de Clifton, and William Fitz Aer. Their report about Morf Forest was literally as follows : \u2014 \"In the first place the Bosc of Claverley was viewed, \u2014 in keeping of Hugh Fitz Robert, Forester of the Fee of the whole County of Salop : \u2014 well kept as regards vert, both in wood and underwood, but yet the underwood is much damaged by many goats frequenting (the cover) . Item, the Bosc of Worefeld was viewed, \u2014 much wasted by ancient waste, to wit, in the time of the great war,4 and also in the time of R. late Earl of Chester,5 who, whilst he was Sheriff, sold 1700 oak-trees there, besides other wastes made in his time for the Castle of Bruges, and besides deliveries (of timber), made for the purpose of enclosing the Vill of Bruges before it was fortified with a Wall. And moreover, the Bosc is much damaged of late through the very many deliveries made to the men of the Manor (Worfield), by order of the King and his Justiciars of the Forest. There are few beasts in the aforesaid Boses, because the beasts were destroyed in the time of war, and in the time when liberty of the forest was conceded.\" 6 4 The Baron's War, which was raging at the time of Henry Ill's accession (1216). 6 The last allusion of the two is to Henry Ill's \" Carta de Forestis,\" which passed the Great Seal on Feb. 11, 1225. I do not see how any of its concessions could operate to the destruction of game in a Forest of demesne such as Morf, 5 Ranulf Earl of Chester, Sheriff of Shropshire, from 1216 to 1223. (See Vol. I, p. 299.)"], [254, "216 MORF FOREST. At the Forest Assizes of 1262, the Agistators accounted for five years' agistment of Morf, viz., for the years 1250-1254. In two of those years the pesson had failed, in another it only produced 7s. 2d. A Regard of Morf Forest (also exhibited at these Assizes) contains a few particulars, which I have given elsewhere. I have related under Tasley a story about Thomas Corbet, Lord of that Manor in 1292.7 The same Assize Roll which furnished that instance of his violent and rapacious character, gives us a second sample, and one very pertinent to our present subject.8 He had been Seneschal of Morf Forest, and when in that office, had been accused of inflicting diverse injuries on the men of Brug. The men of Brug had memorialized the King (Edward I) on the subject. Their petition alleged that they were forced to desert their town through Corbet's persecutions. He had indicted forty four Burgesses as \" Malefactors of the Forest,\" because, in a quarrel on St. James's day (July 25) last, a Forester had been wounded iu certain festive sports near Brug. Corbet was imprisoning all of the said forty-four Burgesses whom he could lay hands upon. Corbet was on terms of intimacy with all the King's Bailiffs in that part of the Country. (Hence, I presume, the Burgesses' appeal to the King.) His real grudge against the Burgesses was alleged to be their refusal to give him a certain cask of wine &c. On receipt of this petition, King Edward, by writ, dated Nov. 28, 1292, ordered his Justices then sitting at Shrewsbury, to inquire into the matter, \" seeing that Roger le Strange, Justice of the Forests beyond Trent, had no leisure to do so.\" \u2014 The Justices, in pursuance of the King's Writ, empanelled the following Jury:\u2014 Wdliam de Roughton (Forester), Philip de Penynton and Elias de Sutton (Verderers), John de Egedon and John Purcel (Agistators), Philip de Cherlecote, William Fitz Hawyse of Westwood, Richard de Hollicott, and Wdliam Hobaud (Regarders), Adam de St. George, Hugh de Beaumes, Robert de Dodinton, John de Umfreyston, Richard de Ingwordine, Roger de Bronton, Walter de Norton, Nicholas Carles, Robert de Asthull, William Paternoster, John de Styvinton, Thomas and Stephen de Oldington, Roger de Ocumbe (Hoccumb), and Henry Atte-purye of Roughton, Jurors of the Vicinage. The Verdict of this Jury was as follows :\u2014 \" There was a wrestling match at Bernard's Hall, though of course the impunity with which outlying deer might be taken would even- tually dimmish the central stock. 7 Vol. I pp 95 96 s pj^ de fwatiSj 20 Edw.

The latter complained to his Seneschal, Thomas Corbet, who held an Inquest thereon. The men of Brug were at the wrestling- match with bows and arrows, but were in no way chargeable with the assault on the Forester. They had been indicted for trespass, not under any Inquest taken on the matter ; but, by Corbet's suggestion to the Justice of the Forest, they had been attached and imprisoned under warrant of the said Justice. Corbet's grudge against the men of Brug,\" continue the Jurors, \"was this : \u2014 Two men of Brug had once promised him a cask of wine, a present in which the cor porate body (communitas) refused to join.\" \" He is a malevolent,\" concluded the Jurors, \" and a procurer of evil.\" The Court ordered that the original petition, the King's Writ thereon, and the Verdict, be transmitted to the King through the men of Brug. The liberal policy adopted by Edward I in respect of the Royal Forests must have created a great change in that of Morf. At one time he specially commissioned his Justices of the Forest to lease out portions of Morf and Kinver. Under that commission, or others of less general character, various Arrentations of Forest land were made, both in his reign and that of his Son. I have already noticed such Arrentations made to Roger de Lee in 1292 and 1300, to Roger Careles in 1293, to the Abbot of Haughmond in 1304, and to Henry Mauveisin in 1305, and also one held by Richard le Fremon of Aston in 1326.11 Besides all these, I should here mention an arrentation made by Roger le Strange and Simon de Elleswrth on May 31, 1296. It was of forty acres lying between the Cover of Morf and the vill of Wodeton (Wooton), which forty acres (measured by the lesser Perch) were then leased to John de Sumersete and Alice his wife ; \u2014 to hold to them and their heirs at a rent of 2d. per acre. It appears, that on another occasion the same John and Alice took forty acres more on similar terms, but that, on the death of John de Sumersete, the Escheator citra Trent seized the whole eighty acres into the King's hand. Alice remarried to Master Canon's, but he had no right to have it within precinct of the Forest, even at a wrestling-match. 9 Turbervill wa3 a Canon of St. Mary Magdalene of Brug. He and Corbet were at issue at the time about some land at Tasley.

Nicholas de Karliolo (Carlisle), and the two petitioned the King on the subject of the Escheator's injustice. The King on Oct. 18, 1299, ordered an inquiry to be made on the subject. The Lease of the first forty acres was duly certified by Roger le Strange, and an inquest, held at Wooton on Nov. 23, 1299, found;\u2014 that John de Sumersete and his wife had been enfeoffed conjointly in eighty acres, in so far as the Assessors (i.e. Arrentators) had had power to enfeoff; \u2014 that the premises were of no higher value than the reserved rent ; \u2014 but that the terms (at which such rent should be payable) had never been fixed. In consequence of this, a King's Writ issued in 1300, conceding to Alice, wife of Nicholas de Carliolo, in fee, eighty acres of waste in Morf Forest, for an annual rent of 13s. 4c?.13 At this period the Jurisdiction of Morf Forest was not so greatly in excess of the actual Forest as in many other cases. By the First Perambulation of Edward I's time, the following vills and plains, formerly pertaining to custody of Morf, were dis forested, viz., the Vills of Gatacre, Bebridge, Witimere, Broughton, and Sutton, with their plains and moors ; also a portion of the vill of Brug (the Low Town), also a certain plain commencing at an ancient trench near Quatford, and extending along the banks of the Severn to the top of a certain croft near Pendeleston.13 At the same time the following Boses, Vills &c., were declared to remain within the Forest, viz., the Vill of Mose, with a plain and a half; the Vills of Quatford and Bromley, with their plains; Burcote, with its plain and bosc; the Vills of Swancote, Hoceumbe, Brandeleye (Bradney) , Broughton, and Wyke (Wyken) ; three houses in Hilton, and a plain and a half there ; the Vills of Dalicote, Grave nor, Hopstan, Chykenhul, Woudenewalle (Woundall), Farncote, Claverleye, Luddesdone, Aston,Wystanesmere, Heytton (Heathton), and Buhvardine; a messuage and one acre and a half at the Scythe in Claverley Manor ; a messuage and parcel of land in the Manor of Nordley; a messuage and assart of the fee of John Fitz Philip (i.e. in Quat) ; two messuages and a plain pertaining to the Vill of Body tone (Bobbington) of the fee of the same John.11 Tbe great and final Perambulation of 1300 declares that the King's Demesne- Bosc, which is called Morf, is a Forest according 12 Inquisitions, 28 Edw.

What ever its date, it abolished the Hundred of Patinton, and transferred it chiefly to the newly created Hundred of Munslow, but in part also to the co-extemporized Hundreds of Stottesden and Brimstree. In the reign of Richard I a number of Manors, originally in Patinton Hundred, were recalled from their transitional status, and again massed under the Liberty or Franchise of Wenlock. So the present Franchise of Wenlock, most nearly of any, represents the Domesday Hundred of Patinton ; but this representation is, at the best, very imperfect, for more than half of the Patinton Manors still remain in other Hundreds than Wenlock ; and there are one or two in Wenlock which had not been antecedently in Patinton. The foregoing Table is intended chiefly to give a synoptical view of the Domesday Hundred of Patinton and its modern representa tives. Some liberties have however been taken with the Record, as viewed superficially. One Manor (Ditton) has been classed under Patinton Hundred without any authority, other than presumption : two Manors (Mostune and Ludecote) have been excluded, but against the primd facie evidence of the Record. This exclusion I justify thus. \u2014 Mostune and Ludecote follow Becheberie as Domesday Manors of Roger Venator, and as all three in Patinton Hundred.1 But it is quite clear that the Scribe, who correctly enough assigned Patinton as the Hundred of Beckbury, omitted to make a proper assign ment for Mostune, and so his omission extends further to Ludecote. The question therefore rests with Mostune, to which, if we restore the proper marginal affix, Ludecote must remain for the present involved iu that restoration. Now, there can be no doubt that Roger Venator's Manor of Mostune is represented by Moston, a township near Stanton upon Hine-heath, in North Shropshire, and within the area of the Domes day Hundred of Odenet.

However, a still further and acknowledged omission in the Record will hereafter be noticed as regards Ludecote. It suffices here to state, negatively and only, that Ludecote was not in Patinton Hundred. jlucfj OTenlocL A section of the Shropshire Domesday is devoted to the pos sessions of the Church of St. Milburg, as they stood at the time of the Survey. This Section \u2014 entitled \" Quod tenet Ecclesia Sanct\u00e6 Milburg\u00e6 'n \u2014 commences thus. \u2014 \"Earl Roger hath made the Church of St. Milburg an Abbey.

Perhaps also some other vills went to form the Domesday Manor, viz., Linley, Caughley, and Arlscot.4 In many of these places the Priors of Wenlock granted very early feoffments, so as more or less to separate the members from the Central Manor. Hence at no period after Domesday do we find the Manor of Much Wenlock spoken of in its original in tegrity. It is therefore difficult to determine what were its Domesday constituents. 1 Domesday, so. 252, b.l. (see Vol. II, p. 36) wdl be explained in a more fitting place. 2. 3 \" West-bradley \" is Bradley near Patton ; \" Bradley\" is Bradley, north of Wenlock. A former mistake on this point 4 These three have been treated of under Broselev."], [262, "224 MUCH WENLOCK. There is however one document which may be brought to bear upon this question, viz., the Bundred Roll of 1255.5 A comparison between that Record and Domesday stands thus :\u2014 Supposing that the 20 hides allotted to Wenlock in Domesday included the above 17 vills; add Broseley (one hide), WUley (half a hide), and Wigwig (one hide), and we have a total of 22J hides for the four Domesday Manors. In 1255, under another mode of combination, we find that Much Wenlock, Cal laughton, Bradley, Wigwig, Wyke, Barrow, Walton, Atterley, Broseley, Arlscot, Bradley (West Bradley), Benthall, Posenhall, Willey, and Linley, were 20J hides, which estimate must be taken to include Marsh, Farley, and Prestenden. Add to this hidage that of Presthope and Caughley (separately given as one hide and one caru cate), and we have a total of 21| hides and one carucate for the same four Manors as constituted _%_ hides in Domesday. The difference then between the two estimates is the difference between a hide and a carucates a difference which at any rate was small, and is often observable in estimates of Manors much less extensive than Wenlock, and in questions far less complex. I shall therefore assume that the members of the Domesday Manor of Wenlock are rightly enumerated as above. In treating of this vast Manor and its various adjuncts, the first object, both in ancient importance and in present interest, must needs be \u2014 THE PRIORY. Wenlock was the oldest and most privileged, perhaps the wealth iest and most magnificent, of the religious Houses of Shropshire. For the germ of this interesting foundation, we must revert to times of extreme antiquity, and accept the testimony of a Writer who, however honest, lived more than four Centuries after the event now to be mentioned, and must therefore have derived his know ledge from legendary sources. William of Malmesbury, who wrote in the earlier half of the twelfth Century, tells us that St. Milburg, daughter of Merewald (who founded Leominster Priory), niece of Wulphere, and grand daughter of Penda, Kings of Mercia, lived in a Nunnery at Wen lock, and was buried there ; moreover, that the said Nunnery was forsaken before the arrival of the Normans, and the place of the Saint's sepulture forgotten.7 Other authorities supply further particulars, viz., that the older names of the place were Llan Meilien and Wimnicas, that the Nunnery was founded by St. Milburg herself, and that she pre- sided therein as Abbess.8 5 Rot. Bundred, II, 84, 85. 7 De Gestis Regum, Lib. II, p. 50, b. ; De Gestis Pontificum, p. 16 i. 6 It is probable that Caughley contained more than a carucate (see Vol. II, p. 44) ; a circumstance which still further lessens 8 Capgrave ; De vitis Sanctorum, so. 232, a. Leland ; Collectanea, II, 157. the discrepancy."], [263, "THE PRIORY. 225 St. Mdburg was Sister of St. Mildred and St. Milgythe, and, if we estimate her \u00e6ra according to her alleged parentage, she must have lived in the end of the seventh Century, when also whatever is true of the particulars above quoted wid have taken place. Whatever was the nature of this first ecclesiastical foundation at Wenlock, the lapse of two Centuries left little of it remaining be yond the sanctity of St. Milburg' s name, the veneration attaching to her place of burial, and, it may be, some traditions as to the identity of such lands as she had devoted to her holy purpose. The destruction of St. Milburg's Church is attributed to the Danes, and will probably have taken place at the time of their con quest of Mercia, \u2014 about a.d. 874. The selection of the same spot, by Leofric Earl of Mercia and his wife Godiva,9 though for a religious establishment of very dif ferent character, was probably suggested by such popular traditions concerning the life and death of St. Milburg as had survived the disturbances of the Century and half which followed the Danish outrage. Leofric was made Earl of Mercia by Canute in 1017, and he died August 31, 1057. He therefore lived in the reigns of Canute, Harold, Hardicanute, and Edward the Confessor. With the first and the last of those Princes he was a special favourite. Besides Wenlock, he is said to have founded, endowed, or benefited the fol lowing Religious Houses, \u2014 viz., Coventry, Leominster, Marie-Stow (Lincolnshire), St. Werburge's (Chester), St. John's (Chester), Evesham, and Worcester. And it is very remarkable, that as at Wenlock, so in each of these seven instances, Earl Leofric's favour was shown to Houses which already existed themselves, or repre sented some pre-existent foundation. He was, in short, the Benefac tor of all, the Refounder of some, but the absolute Originator of none. The nature of these establishments will have been of the usual Saxon character, viz., Colleges of Secular Clergy, combining more or less of the Monastic element. We may confidently place Earl Leofric's re-foundation of Wen lock between the years 1017 and 1035; \u2014 the dates respectively of his own elevation and King Canute's death. That immunity from Danegeld which Domesday records in favour of certain portions of St. Milburg's lands, is in one instance expressly referred to Ca nute's reign. It was clearly an immunity associated with those 9 Flor. Wigorn, I, 216 j W. Malmesbury, p. 44, b., line 42. '29 in."], [264, "226 MUCH WENLOCK. Religious claims which were originated or revived by Earl Leofric's undertaking, and were perhaps urged by him on the King. The extent of the possessions of the Church of St. Milburg in the Confessor's reign (1043-1066) can be accurately determined from Domesday. Its Manors were Erdington, Wenlock (i. e., Much Wenlock), Tichelevorde (corresponding to Eaton- under- Heywood), Madeley, Little Wenlock, Shipton, Petelie (whose modern name is uncertain), Burton (near Wenlock), Godstoch (now Stoke St. Mil burg), Dehocsele (Deuxhill), Pickthorn, Sutton (near Shrewsbury), a small Manor unnamed, but containing half a hide (probably Hughley), and an estate of one hide within the Liberties of Shrews bury. These possessions were estimated to contain seventy-four hides and a quarter, which would be equivalent to nearly 18,000 acres of that period and district, and to a far greater number of modern statute acres. The annual income derivable from the whole, exclusive of the hide at Shrewsbury (which is not valued in Domesday), amounted in the Confessor's time to nearly \u00a350., \u2014 equal to at least \u00a32500. of modern currency. This second Saxon Foundation at Wenlock will hardly have endured for sixty years. William of Malmesbury speaks, in one place, of Wenlock as forsaken at the arrival of the Normans ; but it is evident that he used this language with reference to the foundation of St. Milburg, of which he was speaking at the time, rather than to that of Leofric, which he seems to have forgotten at the moment, though he makes formal mention thereof in another place. Taking his whole evidence however, in conjunction with that of Domesday, we must conclude that, during the gradual sub jugation of the Saxon race, the Church of St. Milburg was de serted, if not destroyed, while its possessions awaited the decree of the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. This will have been sub sequent to a.d. 1071, when the forfeiture of Earls Morcar and Edwin, the Grandsons of Earl Leofric, first placed Shropshire at the Conqueror's disposal. The Normau Earl, between this year (1071) and 1086, founded or restored the Church of St. Milburg at Wenlock\u2014 founded it, inasmuch as he instituted there a new and strictly monastic order of things, represented in Domesday by the word Abbey; restored it, in so far as he endowed the new establishment with all, or nearly all, the possessions of the old. And this was generally the Norman policy when dealing with"], [265, "227 THE PRIORY. the Saxon Colleges. Their possessions were not confiscated, but diverted to ecclesiastical purposes, more or less cognate with the original design. The year 1080 has been assigned as the specific year of this re-foundation by the Norman Earl, \u2014 and with much probability; \u2014 for Wenlock was reputed to be a younger House than Lewes in Sussex, which was originated in 1077-8, and an older than Shrewsbury, which was first designed in February 1083.10 We learn from Domesday, that six years after this alleged date of foundation, viz., in 1086, the Monks of Wenlock were possessed of nearly all that had belonged to the Church of St. Milburg in the days of the Confessor. The exceptions were the two Manors of Erdington and Stoke St. Milburg. The latter had been tem porarily assigned to the Earl's private Chaplains, but ultimately reverted to the Priory ; indeed, the Officers who took the Domesday Survey distinctly notify the claim and better title of St. Milburg. We have already had under Morville another instance of a grant of Church property by Earl Roger to his Chaplains ; and as, in that case, he limited his grant to a life interest, and directed a reversion to the Church, so it is most probable that he took the same pre caution with respect to Stoke St. Milburg. As regards Erdington the case was different. Up to the year 1086 the Monks had made no claim on that Manor ; but we have seen that they did so shortly afterwards, and that the Earl, though he did not restore it, provided an ostensible equivalent. Enough has been said to show that, at the time of Domesday, Wenlock Monastery either possessed, or was shortly to possess, a territory equal in extent and nearly identical with that which had been held by the Church of St. Milburg twenty years before. The relative value of this property at the two periods is found to have been as follows. \u2014 That which in the Confessor's time was estimated as annually worth little less than \u00a350., would in 1086 barely realise \u00a336. Also in 1086, the territory in question em ployed but 80^ teams of oxen, whereas there was arable land 10 The Antiquity of Wenlock, as founded by Earl Roger, is proved by Domesday to be greater than that of Shrewsbury. That Record speaks of the Earl as then making (facit) an Abbey at Shrewsbury, and having made one (fecit) at Wenlock. The Domesday application of the word \"Abbey\" to Wenlock must be taken only as generally indicating a monastic institution, not as in contradistinction to a Priory. The same confusion of terms is prevalent to this day ; but what was then a general expression is now an inaccurate distinction. Wenlock was never an Abbey, though it happened to be called so before its state was recognized or perhaps even settled by the Founder."], [266, "228 MUCH WENLOCK. sufficient for the employment of 141^ teams. The difference un doubtedly arose from the many hindrances to the peaceful cultiva tion of the soil which must have arisen in Shropshire during the interval. Of the existence of Wenlock Monastery during the life of Earl Roger de Montgomery I have seen only two other indications. The first is where, immediately after Domesday, Richard, a Monk of Wenlock, is found attesting the Earl's Charter to his Collegiate Church at Quatford. The other is ostensibly the Earl's own Charter, fixing the future status of Wenlock itself. This extraordinary instrument, it would be easy to dismiss with all its difficulties by the usual and summary process of stigmatizing it as a forgery. But this is not the way to deal with a document from which, with a little trouble, we may learn a great deal, and which, in its essence, that is, in what it claims for its Grantees and what it teaches us, is no forgery at all. Its chief matter is a statement of the reasons which induced Earl Roger de Montgomery to maintain a Religious establishment at Wenlock, and how he chose to affiliate the same on a Foreign House. But the Charter shall speak for itself:11 \u2014 \" In nomine Sanct\u00e6 et Individu\u00e6 Trinitatis, trin\u00e6que Unitatis, Ego Rogerius Salopesberiensis Comes Cum status sacr\u00e6 re ligionis quam maxime fulciatur multimodis bonorum studiis, magis tamen creditur augmentari constructione collegiisque sanctorum c\u0153nobiorum, ubi semper Deo deserviant pia vota atque executa fidelium, unde condign\u00e6 remuneracionis premium divinitus sibi non diffidat repositum quisquis sacra loca vel edificaverit, vel opibus terr\u00e6 ditaverit, aut certe perpetu\u00e6 iwmunitatis vigore, ut ibidem libere placideque divin\u00e6 servitutis munia peragantur, tuta atque secura reddiderit.\u2014 Inde igitur pi\u00e6 matris Ecclesi\u00e6 mos inolevisse creditur priscorum jura Regum sollerti provideutia sanxisse, necnon 11 The only Transcript which I have met with is in Gough's MSS. in the Bod leian Library (Vol. Ill (quarto), p. 59). The attempt of the Writer (J. Bowen) to give it in facsimile suggests that he had the original before him, and that it was written in a very ancient hand. The Transcript is not accurate in all instances ; and I venture to add or alter (in Italics) a few letters where grammatical reasons render such change obvious and neces sary. I add also the proper punctuations, and endeavour to mark those incompleted sentences which are so common in the verbose documents of the period, and are in fact a symptom of genuineness.

Earl Roger having restored the Church of St. Milburge, grants it to the foreign House of La Charite, to which, in token of subjection, the Monks of Wenlock are to pay an annual rent of 100s. And this Earl Roger does with consent of King William II ; therefore between Sept. 26, 1087 (the date of that Monarch's accession), and July 27, 1094 (the latest date assigned13 for Earl Roger's death). At this period the great Benedictine Abbey of Clugny, in Bur gundy, was increasing in wealth and influence. Amongst its five principal and earliest affiliated Priories were the French House of La Charite sur Loire and the English House at Lewes already men tioned. Wenlock, though strictly Clugniac, was, as we see, only mediately subject to Clugny. Its immediate Mistress was the Priory of La Charite. The Order of Clugny was originally Benedictine, and its mem bers retained the black habit of that profession. Its formation 12 Subaudi\"hoc.' puts the Earl's death in 1093, and there are independent reasons for thinking him to be right. 13 Ordericus assigns it (p. 581). Flo rence of Worcester however (Vol. II, p. 31)"], [268, "230 MUCH WENLOCK. belonged to the early part of the tenth Century. William de War ren, whose wife was a step-daughter of the Conqueror, founded the first Clugniac house in England, viz., that at Lewes, in 1077-8. Lanzo, the first Prior of Lewes, with three other Monks, his com panions, were sent over by the Parent Abbey. The Monasteries of this Order in England were uniformly governed by Priors of foreign appointment, and many of the said Priors were themselves Foreign ers. Their Houses were subject to foreign visitation : \u2014 often filled with foreign Monks. Their internal differences were settled by foreign arbitration. Much of their revenues went beyond Sea. The Abbot of Clugny received at one period a fixed annual Pension of \u00a32000. from the English Houses of his Rule. The Prior of Lewes was his High-Chamberlain and Vicar-General in England, Scotland, and Ireland. Such was the allegiance, mediate or immediate, which was owned by Wenlock and at least thirty other English Houses, most of them of greater antiquity than the reign of Henry II. I must now address my remarks to the Sequel, or rather to the appendages of Earl Roger's Charter : \u2014 These consist of several dating and testing clauses, which run as follows : \u2014 \" Actum publice apud Clivam. Auno ab incarnatione Domini millesimo, centesimo tertio decimo. Indictione quarta decima. Signum Willielmi Anglorum \u00bbJ< Regis. Siguum >J\u00ab Willielmi Cancellarii. Signum >J\u00ab Hugonis Comitis S (Salopi\u00e6) Signum >J< Ernulfi fratris ejus. Testibus istis subscriptis, \u2014 Eudone Dapifero, Rogerio filio Geroldi, Waltero filio Ricardi, Godefrido fratre ejus. Apud Clivam.\" Now the mention of Earl Hugh in this testing clause shows that it can only apply to some period between the deaths of Earl Roger (1093-4) and of William Rufus (2nd August 1100). The Charter itself, as we have already seen, belongs to a previous period. The fourteenth year of Indiction must be either 1091, 1106, or 1121. The dominical year, 1113, speaks for itself. Thus, out of four dates, given in or deducible from this document as a whole, three at least are mutually inconsistent. My belief is that these dating and testing clauses were no part of the original Charter, and that the latter was no forgery. The object of forging such a document is not apparent, for it asserts nothing in the way of facts but what is demonstrable on other evidence. I suppose that the Monks of La Charite, being in possession of the"], [269, "THE PRIORY. 231 original Charter, added dates and a testing clause thereto at a sub sequent period; \u2014 such dates and clause indicating perhaps some act of recognition or document of confirmation of which they had distinct certificates or copies. The next notice of Wenlock which occurs is merely incidental. Earl Hugh de Montgomery, granting to Shrewsbury Abbey the tithe of all his venison in Shropshire, excepts that taken in the Woods of St. Milburg, of which probably the tithe had been granted to the Priory. The constant designation of Wenlock Priory under the name of \" St. Milburg \" is worthy of notice. The practical importance of associating the Saxon Saint with the Norman foundation was never lost sight of. The acquisition of the bones of another Saxon Saint (St. Winifred) by the Monks of Shrewsbury, and the monastic value of such possessions, have been well set forth by the Historians of that Town and Abbey, when speaking of a period somewhat later than that now before us. \u2014 The Monks of Shrewsbury encountered the perils of a distant journey and an inhospitable region in pursuit of their object. A similar acquisition was earlier made by the Monks of Wenlock, who had no such obstacles to surmount. There was a tradition that St. Milburg was buried at Wenlock, and a probability that the unknown place of her sepulture would be within the precincts of the ancient Church. If the site of the successive foundations were the same, as probably it was, the accidental discovery of her remains during the progress of the Norman building would be very natural. Of course such an accident happened. \u2014 A boy running over the floor of the proposed building trod open the very tomb of the Saint. The bal samic exhalations usually resulting on such occasions were not want ing : the merits of the Saint, the ingenuity of the Monks, or the enthusiasm of the people, were instantly rewarded by miraculous effects. Crowds thronged to the Sepulchre; cures were effected and widely reported ; but the chief success of dead St. Mdburg was alleged in remedy of such scrofulous disorders as had resisted all other treatment.14 The Translation of her Relics, that is, their removal to a spot in front of the High Altar of the new Church, took place on May 26, 1101. 14 The miraculous cure of King's-evil was not however confined to St. Mil burg. Edward the Confessor had been very successful therein, even when alive ; and the same healing power was said to be hereditary in the Kings of France. From one or both of these causes the disease acquired its name."], [270, "232 MUCH WENLOCK. That day became a standing festival in the subsequent history of the Priory. Many of its rents were made payable thereon, and many of its documents dated thereby. During the reign of Henry I, a question arose which involves some interesting details, but which I speak of here as dlustrating the strong and progressive influence of Wenlock Priory. I have alluded to this matter before, and must often refer to it hereafter. \u2014It seems that the Priory asserted \" all St. Milburg's land to constitute but one Parish,\" that is, to be parochially subject to the Mother Church of Wenlock. It will appear in the sequel that the ecclesiastical territory known as \" St. Milburg's land \" involved many more locali ties than those which the Church of St. Milburg held by the secular tenure recorded in Domesday; but of this elsewhere. \u2014 The spiritual claim of the Priory was contested in several ways during the reign of Henry I ; but it was warmly supported and finally established by Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, who was then Viceroy of Shropshire. Two great assemblies, which seem to have combined the functions of an ecclesiastical Synod and of the Curia Comitatus, sat upon this question, under the appropriate presidency of the mitred Proconsul. One of these was at Wistanstow, apparently about a.d. 1110; the other about a.d. 1115, at Castle Holgate. Their decisions were registered by Belmeis in a formal Charter, which was in aftertimes held to be conclusive (as to the rights in volved) both by King aud Prelate. I copy this Charter from an Inspeximus of Edward III,15 who speaks of it with the same defer ence as of any Patent of his own Royal Progenitors. \u2014 \" Rex omnibus Salutem. \u2014 Inspeximus litteras patentes quas Cele bris memorise Ricardus Londinensis Episcopus fecit Wenlocensi Ecclesi\u00e6 in h\u00e6c verba. \u2014 In nomine Sanct\u00e6 et Individu\u00e6 Trinitatis &c. \u2014 Ego Ricardus dei gratia Londinensis Antistes testor et testi monio plurimorum affirmo terram Sanct\u00e6 Myleburg\u00e6 totam unius esse Parrochi\u00e6, totam videlicet subjacere uni su\u00e6 matri Wenlocensi Ecclesi\u00e6, quam bene novimus sic antiquitus in Anglorum temporibus fuisse, sic et usque hodiernum tempus nostrum jure mansisse.

All that I can say relative to Wenlock, during the reign of Stephen, belongs to the Prior of that period, and shall be given hereafter. In or about the year 1163, a transaction took place which ex tended the influence and reputation, if it added little to the pos sessions of Wenlock Priory. \u2014 Walter Fitz Alan, then Steward of Scotland, was of Shropshire origin, being brother of that William Fitz Alan who died in 1160. During the English war of succession, Walter had entered the ser vice of David King of Scots, Uncle to the Empress Matilda, and had found it his interest to continue in the Country, from which there is every reason to believe that his famdy originally came. In or about the year 1163, conceiving the design of founding a Clugniac Priory at Paisley, near Renfrew, he, not unnaturally, re verted to the associations of his youth, and sought the assistance of Wenlock Priory. Being at Fotheringay in Northamptonshire, probably in the suit of King Malcolm, and if so, surely at the time supposed (1163), he came to an agreement on the subject. The Prior of Wenlock was to colonize the projected House at Paisley with thirteen Monks from Wenlock, leaving it to the Steward to select a Prior from the number. He was further to procure for the new foundation the Recog nition of the Clugniac Order, and speciady that of the Prior of La Charite, and the Abbot of Clugni. In return the Steward made a grant to Wenlock of certain property in his Borough of Renfrew, and some rights of fishery in his Scottish waters. It matters not that in course of time the Shropshire Priory, claiming perhaps too implicit an ascendency over its Northern daughter, lost all title to the affiliation. The original agreement was carried out in the first instance, and was acted upon for half a Century at least. The Prior of Wenlock (Humbald) conducted a Convent of Clugniac Monks to Paisley in 1169. He procured the recognition and confirmation of Savaric Prior of La Charite, and of Stephen Abbot of Clugni, for Paisley Priory. St. Milburg was associated with St. James and St. Merinus in the tutelage of the Scottish House; and if among"], [273, "235 THE PRIORY. the Monks of Paisley the Steward or his Successors should fad to find a competent Prior, they had on any vacancy the option of selecting a Monk of Wenlock, not being the Prior himself, for that office. This understanding was stdl maintained in the year 1207, when it had the formal Sanction of Pope Innocent III. Long before this, and indeed in the time of Prior Humbald, and therefore in or soon after 1169, the said Prior surrendered his property and rights at Renfrew to the Grantor. Walter Fitz Alan hereupon gave to Wenlock, by way of exchange, an equivalent at \" Menewde,\" as Humbald's Charter on the subject informs us.22 Manhood, the place thus indicated, is or was a village giving name to a Hundred in the South-Western Angle of Sussex ; \u2014 a County and a district where Walter Fitz Alan is known to have had other property. I leave a very interesting, but not further relevant subject, merely remarking that there is abundant evidence of Wenlock Priory having retained its interests at Manhood till the Dissolution ; \u2014 thus perpetuating in the sixteenth Century, a memorial of Prior Humbald's northern mission in the twelfth, and of the negotia tions which introduced him to the Progenitor of the Royal House of Stuart. In the thirteenth year of Henry II (1167) the Prior of Wenlock's Demesne is mentioned. The Justice of the Forest had assessed a fine of one merk thereon. Later in the same reign, the Priory made a valuable acquisition in the Manor of Dudinton (now Priors Ditton), which it thence forward held in capite of the Crown. In this and in the succeeding reign, when other Religious Houses are found contributing to the King's revenue in the form of a donum, the Priory of Wenlock seems to be exempt. Its pre scriptive immunities and its foreign allegiance probably contributed to such a result. When at length Wenlock is found sharing in these liabilities, she is also found to be growing in secular im portance and thriving in Royal favour. The Foundation of Dudley Priory by Gervase Paganell has been 22 The whole of this matter about Pais ley is taken from the Register of that Monastery,\u2014 an admirable production of the Maitland Club.

The able Preface of the Editor has also given me much chronological assistance,"], [274, "236 MUCH WENLOCK. spoken of in a former Volume of this book,23 and his Charter thereupon supposed to have passed about the year 1180. It is probable that this Charter,24 though called a \" Foundation Charter,\" was not coeval with the first beginnings of Dudley Priory, but rather was a settlement of an advanced but not quite completed undertaking. The House was by Gervase Paganell's Charter, if not previously, constituted an affiliation of Wenlock Priory. The following expressions imply as much. \u2014 The site of the Priory at Dudley is granted jointly to St. James of Dudley, St. Milburg of Wenlock, and the Monks serving God at Dudley. The Prior of Wenlock was to place any of his own Monks at Dudley, and to appoint a Prior out of the same body, but with consent of Paganell and his heirs as regarded the individual appointed. Similarly, any Prior was to be removed, only by joint counsel of the Baron of Dudley and the Prior of Wenlock. And when the House of Dudley should be able to \"sustain\" its Convent, the Prior of Wenlock, under council of his own Convent and of the Baron, was to institute (constituet) a Convent there.25 This donation Paganell offered with his own hand, on the Altar of St, Milburg of Wenlock before the Convent of Wenlock, and on the Altar of St. James of Dudley before the Monks of that place. The wit nesses on the part of St. Milburg are easily distinguishable from the Baron's Relations and Retainers. They were Warner de Wililey, Roger Dapifer, Hamund Provost, Roger Welcume, Roger Freud, Walter Plesent, Robert de Chaalun, Roger Barat, and Thomas Cocus. Of most of these we shall hear again, and it only remains, in further connection with Dudley, to say that that Priory continued an affiliation of Wenlock till the Dissolution. This is perhaps the fittest occasion to say that a Clugniac Priory, founded at St. Helen's, in the Isle of Wight, before the year 1155, was another affiliation of Wenlock Priory, and was still subject thereto in 1253.26 This relation was probably broken off when, in 23 Supra, Vol. II, p. 52, and note 16. 1253 and February 1254 we have notices of a Suit between the Prior of Wenlock and Walter de Insula. It was about the Advowson of Berding Church (Winton : Diocese), which the Prior claimed on the ground that it had been granted to Saint Helen's (apparently in the time of Henry de Blois, Bishop of Winchester ; i. e. be tween 1129 aud 1171) ; and that Saint Helen's was subject to Wenlock. (Vide 24 Monasticon, V, p. 83, No. II. 25 It is evident, from these terms, that the few Monks already resident at Dudley did not, strictly speaking, constitute a \" Convent.\" That title would, I presume, become proper whenever the Brethren should be formally organized under rule of their own Prior, as yet not appointed. 56 The facts are these. In November"], [275, "237 TIIE PRIORY. consequence of the French wars of Edward III, all alien Priories were seized by the Crown. Nothing of the early history of St. Helen's seems to be known,27 consequently we cannot even conjec ture how it became a dependency of Wenlock. The very fact however of its possessing so distant a Colony bespeaks for the Shropshire Priory a great and ancient reputation. In the last quarter of the twelfth Century the Church Patronage of Wenlock Priory was largely augmented. Isabel de Say, in her own right Baroness of Clun, granted to the Priory the Church of St. George at Clun, with all its subject Churches or Chapels, seven in number.28 The particulars of this grant belong properly to the district where these Churches stood. I pass on therefore to matters less external. The reign of Richard I brought an aggrandizement to this House, which, to form an idea of its importance, must be estimated from its results rather than from the King's Charter, which is in general terms, but shall nevertheless be given in a note.29 It was probably in return for some great but unrecorded subsidy supplied by the Monks in aid of Richard's warlike necessities, that this Charter was obtained, and thus a new Franchise created in Shropshire. The Seigneury thereof, involving both influence and revenue, was conferred on the Prior of Wenlock. This Franchise was composed of Manors taken chiefly from the old Hundred of Munslow, but in part from the Hundreds of mot, and all other customs pertaining to the Crown. He also concedes Sac, Soc, toll, theam, and infangthef with other franchises belonging to the Crown ; and finally, that in all places of their concern, the Prior and Convent -pay do their plea sure. Witness : William Fitz Alan, at Placita, Mich. Term, 37, 38 Hen. Ill, memb. 48 dorso, and Rot. Fin. II, 179.) The subjection of the Prior of St. Helen's must have been implicit, if, as would seem to be the case, he could only sue for his rights in the name of his Superior at Wenlock. \u00bb Monasticon, VII, 1049. 28 Monasticon, V, 76, No. IV.

Its limits corresponded nearly, if not exactly, with the modern Franchise of Wenlock. At the same time the Prior and his Tenants within the said district were ex empted from all obligation to do suit at other Hundred-Courts, or even at the greater Court of the County. These privileges are shown in full exercise in an Inquest of much later date,30 but we have also earlier dlustrations of the fact ; for instance: \u2014 In the year ending Michaelmas 1199, the Sheriff, accounting for the Ferm of Shropshire, discharges himself of a liability of 52*., which he seems not to have received in conse quence of a Writ Royal, ordering the \" acquittance of the lands of the Prior of Wenelac of suits of the County and of Hundreds.\" 31 Again we learn from another source, presently to be mentioned, that the Prior of Wenlock had no less than three Charters of King Richard, concerning his Franchises. In the same reign probably, the Prior obtained a Charter from Wdliam de Vere, Bishop of Hereford, confirming that extraor dinary Parochial Jurisdiction which was claimed by St. Milburg. I give the Charter in the Bishop's words : 32 \u2014 \" Willielmus dei Gratia, Herefordensis Episcopus, omnibus &c. salutem.

The Sheriff thenceforth received less, but accounted for the same. I have given a former instance of this. (Supra, p. 71.) 33 This is very remarkable. The Bishop speaks of the Viceroy Belmeis and his Assessors at Winstantow, as \" Judges Delegate ; \" a term which in his (De Vere's) time implied Nominees of the Papal Court.

He paid \u00a315., that is, =\u20ac5. less than the Abbot of Shrewsbury, but .\u00a310. more than the Abbot of Haughmond. In 1203, the Contributions of Wenlock, Shrewsbury, Haughmond, and Lilleshall, to a similar Aid, were thirty, twenty, five, and five merks respectively. I shall hereafter have to refer to the Will of Dame Agnes, wife of the second Walter de Clifford. It was made during her husband's lifetime, that is before the year 1221. She bequeaths two merks towards \"the fabric of the Church of Wenloc.\"34 On Sept. 25, 1224, the King (Henry III) being at Shrewsbury, orders that the Market, which had used to be held at Wenlock on Sundays, should be held for the future on Mondays.35 On the 29th August, 1226, Henry III was at Wenlock, on his road from Shrewsbury to Brug. In the beginning of the year 1227 the Prior of Wenlock gave the King twenty merks to have confirmed the three Charters of King Richard concerning the franchises (libertatibus) conceded to him, also to have a grant of one Fair and two Markets.36 A Confirmation of tivo only of King Richard's Charters appears to be enrolled on this occasion. The confirmation bears date at West minster Feb. 19, 1227. It grants to the Prior his portion in the Woods of Sirlet and of Mount Gilbert, as was settled in the Court of King Richard. It further grants that his lands, men, and tithes shall be free from Suits, Gelds, Aids of Foi-esters, from Sheriffs, Shires (County Courts), Hundreds, Pleas &c., and that they shall have soc, sac &c., \" as the Charter of King Richard, which the King had inspected, did testify.\"37 The Fair which Henry III granted was to be held at Wenlock annually on the vigil, the day, and the morrow of St. John the Bap tist. The Markets were, one at Wenlock on Mondays as before, and one at Eton (Eaton uuder Heywood) on Thursdays. This Charter bears date Feb. 18, 1227. Another Writ of the King, date February 20, bids the Sheriff to allow the Prior of Wenlock to levy a reasonable aid on the free tenants of his bailiwick, to enable him to discharge the debt due to the Crown for the franchises thus aUowed to him and his men.38 34 Dodsworth, Vol. 68, so. 91.

At the County Assizes, October 1227, the King's Justices amerced the Prior of Wenlock ten merks for some trespass.39 A few years later, and the Prior of this House (Imbert) is found to be specially employed by the King. In June 1232 he was sent over Sea in the Royal service, and had the usual letters of Protection during his absence. Later in the same year the King paid two distinct visits to Wen lock. He was there on August 9 and 10; \u2014 and on November 30 and December 1. On the last occasion the Prior was again com missioned with some foreign negotiation. On June 7, 1233, the King was here once more. On that day he received in his Wardrobe at Wenlock a sum of \u00a3106., being an in stalment of the tax of the fortieth assessed in the previous year on this County. \u2014 The lands of the Prior of Wenlock are specially stated to be exempt from this tax.40 These Royal visits to Wenlock are further iUustrated by entries on the Shropshire Pipe Rolls of the 16th and 17th of Hem-y III, where the Sheriff charges his expenses in forwarding the King's wines from Brug and Wenlock to Salop, and from Brug to Wenlock. On July 19, 1236, King Henry, being at Worcester, grants letters of protection for the lands and men of Imbert Prior of Wenlock, whom he has sent over Sea. On October 21 following, the same Prior is commissioned to see that Gilbert Marshall Earl of Pembroke makes compensation for injuries done to Lewellyn Prince of Wales.41 In 1236, 1237, and 1238, we have charges on the Pipe Roll for sending the King's wine to Wenlock, and in the last two years some remains of the stock seem to have been sold. In July 1244, the Prior of Wenlock was one of the Commissioners for negotiating a truce with David ap Lewellyn. In the same year this House made a great acquisition in the Manor of Oxenbold, which was forthwith transferred from Munslow Hundred to Wenlock Liberty. The next year (1245) the Prior obtained the Advowson of Long 39 Rot. Pip. 12 Hen.

He was also fined 40s. for some trespass, probably con nected with his acquisition of Oxenbold. I have before alluded to the famous Her of Geoffrey de Langley in Shropshire. It took place early in 1250. \u2014 Heavy was the hand of the Justiciar on Imbert Prior of Wenlock, whom he lest liable to extraordinary penalties. Subsequently the Prior's three compositions of trespasses were assessed altogether at the large sum of \u00a3126. 13s. 4d. The greater part of this charge arose from the Prior's proceedings at Madeley, under which Manor the particulars shall be given ; but it would also seem that the Prior had been assarting forest-lands in all directions without license, a matter which subjected him not only to immediate fine, but to a future rent-charge of five merks per annum, in respect of such assarts at Wenlock, Willey, Callaughton, Shineton, Burwardsley, Cotes, Longville, Lushcote, Preen, Legh, Caldebrok (Coalbrookdale), and Wulfheresford. Three years' arrears of this rent were charged against the Prior in 1252,42 and twelve years in 1261;43 but it appears that before the latter period his successor had redeemed the charge ; in what way shall appear in due course. Among the miscellaneous documents of the Testa de Nevill^ is a Return, apparently of the year 1251, which says under Munslow Hundred that \" the Church of Wenloc and the place of Wenloc are of the Advowson of the Lord King.\" \u2014 The meaning of such a statement at that period I cannot pre cisely set forth ; but it is clear that an idea was already on foot which eventually led to practical interference with the immunities of this Clugniac House. In 1252 the Prior of Wenlock owed \u00a36. for two purchases which he had made of the King's Wines. When the Inquisitions of Hundreds were taken in 1255, the Liberty of Wenlock was the subject of a separate Return. All the Manors therein were stated to be held under the Prior, and to owe Suit to his Court only.45 Much Wenlock proper, with its members, was held of him exclusively, that is, he was Lord of the Fee, and not merely of the Soke. Till King Richard's time it had been in Muns low Hundred, and had done Suit thereto as well as to the County. From these Suits it was now free. In the year 1258, Imbert Prior of Wenlock seems to have made many instances this tenure under the Prior must be understood to relate only \"2* 43 Rot. Pip. 36, 45 Hen.

He represented to the King \"that his woods in the land of St. Milburg of Wenlok were always free of Regard till the visit of that Justiciar, who had arrentated certain assarts therein at five merks, contrary to the aforesaid quittance and franchise.\" The King's Writ which issued hereupon caused an Inquest to be held at Hales Paunton (Sheriff-Hales) on June 16, 1259, by the Justice of the Forests citra Trent, and upon oath of the Foresters and Verderers of Shropshire, with two Knights and several other freeholders. Their return confirmed the Prior's statement, and they said that \" Geoffrey de Langley had arrentated all assarts in discriminately, both such as were without and such as were within Regard.\"*6 \u2014 Nevertheless this grievance remained without present remedy. On the 1st of November 1259, and again on the 10th of August 1260, the Prior of Wenlock (it must have been Imbert) was put on different Commissions to treat with Lewellyn. On Sunday August 22nd he was a party to the formal pacification then agreed upon at Montgomery.47 Very shortly after this, Imbert Prior of Wenlock was deceased. He had ruled the Monastery as much as forty years, and was perhaps the ablest of all who ever held that office. At his death, Geoffrey de Northampton, as a Royal Escheator, seized the estates of the Priory into the King's hand, a thing which was said to have been against all precedent, for no Escheator had on any previous vacancy entered ou the Liberty. Geoffrey de Northampton moreover exe cuted his office with extortionate rigour, and wrought damage and destruction in the Granges, Vivaries, Woods, and Parks of the Priory, particularly at Madeley and Oxenbold, to the value of 10 merks and more : he also took 20 merks from the Tenants of St. Milburg, which he carried off with him.4S The Sub-prior and Convent at length gave the Escheator a fine of 100 merks to have the custody and profits of their House during the pending vacancy.49 This Vacancy did not long endure, for on April 8th, 1261, the 46 Inquisitions, 43 Hen.

In lieu therof, Ebulo de Montibus, doubtless a relation of the Prior, had, at instance of the latter, assigned to the King and his heirs 100*. annual rent, which Ebulo had been used to receive in the town of Cambridge.51 Thus ended Geoffrey de Langley's arrentation on Wenlock Priory. The charge was formally released by Letters-Patent bearing date March 22, 1262. On June 26, 1262, Prior Aymo had Royal License to make ex tensive Assarts of lands already the property of his House, but which, notwithstanding King Richard's Charter, were held to be within Regard of the Forest. Twenty acres in Middleton (Priors), fifteen acres in Dolmonesleg (near Wenlock), seven in Atterley, eight in Madeley, four in Weston (near Monk Hopton), two in Walton, two in Barrow, and two acres in Wigwig, were thus brought iuto cultivation.62 On December 5, 1265, Prior Aymo obtained King Henry Ill's Charter freeing him and his men from murage and other customs throughout the Realm.53 On the death of Prior Aymo in 1272, Wenlock was again seize d by the Crown; but John Fitz Aer, Sub-Escheator in Shropshire, exercised his office so well and honestly, that the former complaints were not renewed.54 Again, within the same year, a fine of 100 merks procured for the Convent the custody of its House and lands during the vacancy. This fine, negotiated with Heury III, was charged against the Prior and Convent in the Pipe Roll of 1 Edw. I (1273), from which I infer that the vacancy was already filled.

On June 20, 1290, King Edward I inspected and confirmed several Charters of Kings Richard and Henry III to the Priory.56 A King's Writ of March 28, 1283, exempts Cistercian Houses from the tax of the thirtieth, then in course of collection, till further orders. Weulock Priory is one of a very few Houses not Cistercian which had a similar reprieve.57 On November 1, 1291, the Prior of Wenlock obtained a Charter of Free Warren for his estates at Wenlock, Stoke St. Milburg, Boccleton, Newton, Kinson, (Gee) Downton, More, Monks Weston (near Monk Hopton), Monks Mughale (Monkhall), Burton, Cal loughton, (Monk) Hopton, Oxenbold, and Shipton.58 The Ecclesiastical Taxation of the same year informs us of the situation and value of most of the Prior's Estates ; and, though it leaves unspecified many minor sources of income, we may gather from it a general idea of the influence and prosperity of the House. Both iudeed were very great, but not so great as the antecedents of Wenlock might seem to have promised. In the way of lands and Churches, two Centuries of Clugniac Rule had added something to the Saxon Monastery, but nothing proportionate to its original endowment. Its chief acquisitions since Domesday had been the Manors of Ditton and Oxenbold, a moiety of Patton, and the Ad vowson of the Clun Churches. But, though its possessions had not greatly increased in bulk, their relative value will have been constantly improving. Under the ex traordinary Franchises which the Prior of Wenlock exercised, each Tenant of his House was a privileged man, each acre of his domain acquired a twofold value. He was taxed very moderately in respect of his subjection to the foreign House of La Charite, and had rarely contributed at all to the revenues of the King of England. For certain voluntary offerings to the latter he had received more than an equivalent. Wenlock was in short at this period (1291) a richer foundation than the purely Norman Abbey of Shrewsbury ; and its steady and 55 Rot. Bundred, II, p. 110. <** Pat. 22 Edw.

As far as we can judge from Pope Nicholas' Taxation, the Tem poralities of Wenlock in 1291 realized an annual income of more than \u00a3144. ; but \u00a319. 9s. 4d. of that sum arose from profits on farming-stock. \u2014 The value of its Advowsons was about \u00a3130.joer annum; and the Priory had an income arising from Church pensions and portions of which particulars are given to the extent of \u00a36. or \u00a37.59 At the Assizes of October 1292 the Prior of Wenlock was ques tioned as to his right of Free Warren in several Manors. He alleged the King's Charter of the previous year granting the said privilege not only in the Manors whereof question was made, but in others, of which Wenlock itself was one.60 He was further prosecuted under two Writs of Quo Waranto, one of which related exclusively to his possession of Ditton. The other was more general, and questioned his right of holding Market, Fair, and Pleas of the Crown in Dodynton (Ditton), Wenlock, and Eton. As to the Fair and Market, the Prior disposed of that matter by putting in the Charters of Henry III, as already quoted and as con firmed by Edward I. It does not however appear by the pleadings that he claimed the right in Ditton. \u2014 His jurisdictional claim was to hold\" two Great Courts yearly in Wenlock or in Eton, as he chose, and to try all pleas therein which a Sheriff ordinarily tried iu his Tourn : also he claimed to have in fangethef, utfangethef, sok, aud sak in Ditton, Wenlock, Eton, and in all lands of his demesne. For this he quoted King Edward I's Charter, so far as it confirmed the Charter of King Richard, who had \" conceded and confirmed to St. Milburg of Wenlock and the Monks there, sac, soc, tol, team, and infangethef, with other liberties and free customs pertaining to the King.\"- \u2014 \u25a0 The Prior was dismissed without further question under this writ.61 On May 27, 1331, the Bishop of Hereford (Thomas Charlton) being at Morville, confirmed all the Churches, Chapels, and Pensions belonging to the Priory .63 In 1333 the Prior of Wenlock contributed 10 merks to the Aid 69 ra\u00e6a</o\u00ab,pp.74andl64.

Only nine English Monasteries contributed higher sums.63 In January 1337, Edward III forbad all alien Priories, Wenlock amongst the number, to transmit any tribute or revenue to the foreign Houses of which they were affiliations. They were however to have such tribute ready in hand, to meet the King's further orders.64 \u2014 This was anticipatory of the war with France, which broke out in the same year ; and on July 1 the King seized upon all the Mo nasteries in England which owned a French allegiance.65 On June 26, 1342, the King confirms an acquittance, which Guy chard Prior of Wenlock had given to his Tenants in general, of a sum of 100*., which the said Prior and his predecessors had by custom levied annually on the said Tenants.66 This rent had, I doubt not, been annually transmitted to the House of La Charite. Ou October 8, 1313, Wenlock was one of twenty-one English Priories which, under pain of utter confiscation, were forbidden to send money on any pretext, or in obedience to any authority what ever, to a foreign Superior.67 In 1348 I find Wenlock Priory stdl in the King's hand, but in trusted to the Prior at an annual rent of 200 merks, payable to the Crown.68 On February 16, 1361, Peace having been concluded between the King of France and Edward III, the latter restored to the Prior of Wenlock his lands, Advowsons &c, to hold as freely as he held the same before the seizure thereof, and without auy ferm hereafter to be paid to the King of England. The Writ calls Wenlock Priory \"a Cell of the Priory of La Charite, in the realm of France.\" 69 On the renewal of Edward Ill's war with France, less rigorous terms were enforced against Wenlock Priory than on its first for feiture. On June 16, 1370, the Prior of Wenlock appeared by his Attorney, the Prior of Dudley, before the Barons of the Exchequer, and, acknowledging that he was heretofore bound to pay a tribute of 100*. per annum to the Prior of La Charite, in Burgundy, ex pressed his willingness to pay the same to the King of England as long as the war should last.

It was also charged with one or more Corrodies in the nomination of the Crown. Nearly a Century elapsed before the separation of Wenlock from its foreign allegiance was recognized by the Parent Monastery, or had Papal Sanction. A Bull of Pope Alexander VI, dated Oct. 7, 1494, at length pronounced the supreme sentence of separation, for reasons too long to recite, but of which the principal seems to have been the inconvenient distance from the Priory of La Charite or the Abbey of Clugny, from which, says the Bull, Wenlock \" immediately and mediately used to depend.\" 74 This severance was further sanctioned by Pope Adrian VI, in 1523. His Bull also confers several facilities to meet those incon veniences which a House of Clugniac constitution must necessarily have suffered when separated from its Parent.75 Wenlock, thus made independent, was never, like Bermondsey, another Clugniac House, exalted into an Abbey. If it gained anything by exemption from foreign jurisdiction, it lost more by the change of its internal economy and the consequent failure of discipline. Its recognition as English only subjected it to the extortions of a government which had no longer such foreign interests to maintain as had contributed to the rise and prosperity of alien Houses.

In the other, the King's Officers were valuing the King's property, already in the market. Under either estimate, Wenlock had become a poorer House than Shrewsbury. On the same day of January 1540, the late Prior and Convent were pensioned off with a gross sum of \u00a3100. per annum.79. Of this the Prior had \u00a330. to himself. The Sub-prior and Eleven Monks shared the rest between them. In giving account of any Religious Foundation, it has always been customary to add a list of its successive Governors, and with good reason ; \u2014 for such a list not unfre quently presents the names of men whose genius or worth was known beyond the walls of a Convent. Moreover such a list is often of great use in investigating the chrono logy of aperiod when specific dates were little employed. Lastly, some former lists of the Priors of Wenlock are so inaccurate, that a new one, carefully drawn up, will at least establish some truth and bring in question some error. PRIORS OF WENLOCK. Peter is the first of whom I find mention. He is Grantor in a Deed dated a.d. 1120. Rainald was the friend and companion of Robert de Bethun, Bishop of Hereford. He follows the Bishop in attesting a Charter, about 1138-9.79 In March 1148, both were at the Council of Rheims, and the Prior was in attendance on the Prelate when he died there, on April 22.80 William of Wycumb addressed his Life of Bishop Bethun to this Rainald.81 A Charter of Rainald' s, which probably passed about 1150, will be cited hereafter. Humbald, or Wynebald,82 attests two Shrewsbury and one Haughmond Charter, between 1155 and 1160. In 1169, he colonized the Scottish Monastery of Paisley, from Wenlock.83 He attests a Shrewsbury Charter about 1170. Peter de Leia was promoted from this Priorate to the See of St. David's, and consecrated Nov. 7, 1176. Henry was Prior some time during the reign of Henry II. An extant Charter of his leaves little doubt that he came between Peter de Leia and \u2014 Robert,84 who occurs as Prior Nov. 22, 1192, and attests Deeds perhaps two years later.

He occurs as still holding the Priory of Wenlock in September 1200, but that of Daventry he appears to have resigned. I take him to be that \"J. Prior of Wenloc \" whom Giraldus mentions about March 1202.86 In 1208 he was elected by the Monks of Coventry to the See of Lichfield and Coventry, but the Papal Legate annulled the election. He died June 14, 1216, but it does not appear that at that time he held the Priorate of Wenlock as well as of Coventry.87 Humbert, or Imbert, Prior of Wenlock, was already in office Nov. 20, 1221. 88 He occurs continuously from that date till Aug. 22, 1260, soon after which he died. His successor was \u2014 Aymo de Montibus, who, having been Prior of Bermondsey, was admitted, by Letters-Patent, to Wenlock, on April 8, 1261.89 In August 1263, this Prior has Letters of Protection.90 On Feb. 7, 1265, custody of the Priory of Northampton is committed to him, which Priory, says the Record, \"is so damaged by the conflict, that regular discipline cannot be observed therein.\" 91 St. Andrew's of Northampton, I should observe, was an affilia tion of La Charite sur Loire. It was not at this time vacant ; but the substitution of Aymo de Montibus for the real Prior, Guy, was not the King's act, but that of Montfort and his Partisans, who now had the King a prisoner. The \" conflict \" alluded to was that of April 6, 1264, when the King had won a signal success at Northampton against the Rebels. The intervening battle of Lewes had changed the attitude of parties to their present state. Again, in August following, the Battle of Evesham was fought ; and a genuine Patent of December 5 shows Prior Aymo as much in 85 Dugdale says he was also Prior of Bermondsey. The statement is not bor rowed from or consistent with the Annals of Bermondsey ; a circumstance which by no means invalidates its truth. is probably meant. 88 Tanner and Blakeway give a Prior Richard of Wenlock, under date of 1221. The authority seems to be the Bermond sey Annals, which say that Richard, quit ting the Priorate of Bermondsey in that year, was made Prior of Wenlock. If the fact of such a change be true, the date given must, I think, be too late. se Anglia Sacra, II, 560. At the Assizes, October 1203, the Prior of Wen lock essoigned his attendance, by Wdliam de Wenlock. w On July 15, 1215, it appears that the Priors of Wenlock and Coventry were two distinct persons.

His Successor \u2014 John de Tycford, or Thifford (whom I find to have resigned the Priory of St. Andrew's, Northampton,94 in this very year), was admitted by Letters-Patent to Wenlock on November 12, 1272. It will have been he who on June 23, 1273, was commissioned to re monstrate personally with Lewellyn, in regard to certain encroach ments of that Prince in the King's honour of Montgomery.95 This Prior probably held office for twelve years.96 Henry de Bonville, who would seem to have been made Prior of Bermondsey in May 1285, was, later in the year, appointed to Wenlock.97 The Temporalities of Wenlock were restored to him as \" Henry de Bono Villar, formerly Prior of Bermondsey,\" by Letters-Patent of September 10, 1285. He is probably the same with \u2014 Henry, Prior of Wenlock, who occurs in 1292, 1297, 1301, and 1306, and who is mentioned as deceased in 1321. 98 Gwicard de Caro Loco, who had for more than a year been Prior of Northampton, had the Temporalities of Wenlock by Letters- Patent of February 26, 1320.99 He was still in office October 3, 1344. One of this name occurs as only a Monk of Wenlock in 1360. joining obedience on the Convent. 92 The original Patent is in possession of Mr. George Morris, of Shrewsbury. See also Rot. Pat. 50 Hen. Ill, m. 38. The Annals of Bermondsey give it that Gwicard, Prior of Bermondsey, resigning in 1265, became Prior of Wenlock; \u2014 a mere invention, for which I cannot ima gine the smallest evidence to have ever existed. 95 F\u0153dera, Vol. I, p. 504. 96 Willis (Mitred Abbeys, II, 193) gives John Tubbe as Prior about 1277. This appears to me to be a misconstruc tion of a passage in the Assize Rolls of 1292, where one John Tubbe is said to have been a Grantee of John, late Prior of Wrenlock.

The Visitor's Orders and Man dates are preserved. They bear date 7th September 1523, and it was not till June 6, 1524, that the said Visitor re-intrusted the Priory to Roland, and prorogued his further Visitation for a year. For this business Prior Roland informs us that he paid \u00a317. to the Lord Legate, besides maintaining his Officer. The last mention of Prior Roland is a receipt dated July 6, 1526, whereby \" Robert Litle, Grom of the King's beddys,\" acknowledges payment at his hands of one of the King's Corrodies.113 His Successor was \u2014 John Bayly, Baylis, or Crissage, whose seizin of the Tempo ralities is referred to a Patent of December, 18 Hen.

The corporate Towns of the thirteenth Century were of three principal classes, viz., those which were held by Royal Charter, those which had arisen under sufferance of some feudal Chief, and those which were of the patronage of the Church, that is, incorporated by the Lords of a spiritual Fief. Shropshire affords instances of each class. \u2014 Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth were of the first, Oswestry and Ludlow of the second, Wenlock and the Abbey Foregate of Shrews bury belonged to the third. The Domesday notice of Wenlock Manor gives us no intimation of a Town therein. The district involved seems to have been purely 112 Register at Willey, so. 22, b. 113 Ibidem, so. 52. 116 Extracts from a Register at Wynn stayj \u2014 communicated by Mrs. Stackhouse, Acton. 114 Monasticon, V, 73. 115 Register at Willey, so. 51"], [298, "254 MUCH WENLOCK. agricultural. The Town then gradually sprang up under the auspices of the Priory. The relations of Town and Priory will have been those of any other Borough and its Lord, that is, the privileges of the Burgesses can have arisen only under successive concessions of the Priory. It is nearly ten centuries after Domesday before we find the Town of Wenlock with any indication of a corporate government. That suburb of Shrewsbury now known as the Abbey Foregate presents a history very analogous. It was part of the original en dowment of the Abbey. It gradually became populous, and had a Corporation of its own, subject still to the Abbey and wholly inde pendent of the Municipality of Shrewsbury. Its corporate privileges were however acquired much earlier than those of Wenlock. I must leave it to a quotation of successive documents to show the names and something as to the tenure of the early Burgesses of Wenlock. I select such documents chiefly as concern tenements and Tenants within the Vill. Where, as often happened, a Manorial Tenant was also holder of a Burgage, the fact will appear under other heads. \u2014 On September 26, 1199, Edusa Fitz Emma, who claimed under writ of mort d'ancestre a messuage and acre of land in Wenlock, remitted her claim for half a merk to Prior Joibert, the Tenant or Defendant.117 In 1212 the Vill (villata) of Wenlock was amerced three merks by the Justices of the Forest, then in eyre. * At the Assizes of 1221, Alice daughter of Alice de Wenlok sued Hamo Fitz Gilbert for 24 acres in Wenlock, which she claimed as heir of her Mother. Hamo showed that the Plaintiff had a uterine Brother, which of course put au end to her claim.118 At the same Assizes, Benedict Fitz Adam faded in establishing a charge of disseizin which he had against the Prior concerning a tenement in Wenlock.119 Another Suit I understand to have been as follows : \u2014 Hamo Fitz Geoffrey had given to Muriel his daughter and her heirs a messuage and some land in Wenlock, adjoining his own house, reserving only a rent of 6d. to himself and heirs. Muriel was now wife of William Mail, Hamo was dead, and, Roger Fitz Hamo his heir neglecting to perform the services due on his whole tenancy to the Prior of Wenlock, the latter distrained William and Muriel for the same. They alleged that Roger Fitz Hamo was bound, for the 6d. rent which they paid him, to save them harmless in the matter. n7 Pedes Finium, 1 John, Salop. | lls- 119 Assizes, 6 Hen.

Roger, being summoned into Court, appeared, and pleaded that the premises were the marriage portion of his Mother, so that his Father had no right to dispose of them. He afterwards withdrew this plea, and the Court ordered the Sheriff to oblige him by distress to ex onerate the Plaintiffs, if in future he failed to do so.120 At the same Assizes, Ichenard Fitz Fulco withdrew the plea of novel disseizin which he had against the Prior and Walter de Heford, concerning a tenement in Wenlock.121 Also Robert son of William de Witton withdrew the Suit of mort d'ancestre which he had against Ichenard le Tannur for three acres in Wenlock.123 Lastly, a suit of mort d'ancestre which Robert le Turnur and Emma his wife had against William Brito for a quarter of a virgate in Wenlock was adjourned to Warwick, the Defendant not appearing. At Warwick, on January 14, 1222, this suit was further adjourned to Westminster,133 where I lose it. These suits have more than the mere interest of local details. They show that, notwithstanding his great Franchises, the Court of the Prior of Wenlock was inadequate to deal with some questions which, had they arisen in a Royal Borough, could not be removed into the Curia Regis in their simple form and under ordinary cir cumstances. I mean that Placita de morle antecessoris, or Placita Servitii, would, in such a Borough, be reducible to the simple form of Placita de Recto, and so terminable in the local Court. As to Pleas of novel disseizin, I shall have more to say hereafter. In August 1226, Adam Fitz Hamo gives half a merk to the King for license to compound a suit of mort d'ancestre which he had against Warm Fitz Alice, concerning 42 acres in Wenlock.-*24 In November 1235, a Fine was levied between John Fitz Nicholas, Plaintiff, and Ingerich de Salop, Tenant, of three messuages in Wen lock, whereof was plea.

The Tenant paid four merks.126 In Trinity Term, 1243 Walter Bonvalet names Adam Bonvalet as his Attorney in the Suit of customs and service which he had against the Prior of Wenlock.137 On April 28, 1247, a King's Writ issued to the Sheriff of Shrop shire, commanding him to hold Inquest as to what customs and services the men of the Prior of Wenlock, within the vill of Wenlock, ought rightfully to perform to the said Prior, in respect of their several tenements within the said vill ; \u2014 also as to what customs and services the said Prior had extorted arbitrarily and against right from the said men. The answer given by twelve Jurors to this inquiry, I should be particular in recording at length, were it not for the mutilated state of the document. It affords however the means of estimating very proximately the constitution of the Borough of Wenlock in the middle of the thir teenth Century. There were eight freemen in the Vill of Wenlock whose feoff ments were of ancient date. Richard, son of Richard Fitz Gilbert, held his tenement at a rent of 5s., payable to the Prior, and he owed suit to the Court of Wenlock, on any reasonable summons, in common with other freemen of the Fee of St. Milburg. On the day when the said Tenant paid his rent he was allowed a Monk's Corrody, which he was at liberty to take to his own house. Six other Tenants of the same class are named, viz., Richard Chamberlain (Camerarius) of Wenlock, Hydbenard Fitz Gilbert, William Fitz Adam of Wenlock, Warin Fitz Warin of Wenlock, Richard Fitz Robert of Wenlock, and John de Beckbury. The last held his Tenement under the Priory Kitchen. Their rents to the Priory were respectively 2s. ;\u2014 6s. ;\u2014 3s. Ad. ;\u2014 2s. 8d. ; \u2014 3s.128 ; \u2014 and 4s. per annum. They owed the same suit as Richard son of Richard Fitz Gilbert aforesaid. The extortions of the Prior seem to have been as follows:\u2014 the 126 Pedes Finium, 21 Hen. Ill, Salop.

There were furthermore thirty-nine Burgesses who paid the Prior Is. per annum each for their free Burgages. If any Burgess, being a Baker, Draper, or * * *, broke any assize (as regulated by Statute elsewhere), he was amerced at Wenlock, under some peculiar custom of the Borough. The Prior exacted a toll on Beer, both from his Freemen and from his Burgesses aforesaid, over and above the cus toms and services already set forth, which exaction the Jury said was arbitrary and unjust.139 At the Assizes of January 1256, Alice Fitz Warin, as heir of her mother (Alice Fitz Pagan), sued the Prior for twenty-seven acres in Wenlock, but failed to prove that the Prior was Tenant of the premises, and so was nonsuited. 130 At the same Assizes, John son of John Tece withdrew the Writ of mort d'ancestre which he had against Roger Pylle concerning a plot of ground, eighty feet long by thirty wide, in Wenlock.131 In April 1258, Henry le Gos of Wenlock with Alice his wife and Matilda and Margery, sisters of Alice, are entered on the Rolls as having fined half a merk for an assize of novel disseizin, to be taken before Giles de Erdinton. The Defendant was the Prior of Wenlock, and a tenement in Wenlock was the subject of dispute.133 On September 3, 1258, William Bon Valet had a writ of novel disseizin against Hugh de Seynton (Shineton) and others, concern ing a tenement in Magna Wenlok.

At the Forest- Assizes of February 1262, Richard le Chamberleng of Wenlock had been entered on the list of those who were assessable for vert ; but the entry is cancelled, apparently because the matter was not within regard. In May 1263, and again in December of the same year, John de Thongland appears as prosecuting a plea of mort d'ancestre against Roger, son of Peter le Marescal, concerning a messuage and land in Wenlock.134 In 1267, Hugh le Masun was prosecuting the Prior and others under writ of novel disseizin, for a messuage and five acres of land in Wenlock. The cause came before the King in August, at Shrews bury, when the Plaintiff withdrew his Suit.135 On the same occasion, Hugh Lord of Chenton (Shineton) came into Court, and, with consent of his heir, conceded to Hamo Cham berlain of Wenlock and Alice his wife, and their heirs, a messuage in Wenlock, and liberty of having six head of cattle in Hugh's common-pasture of Shineton, and twelve swine in his wood.136 Another suit, heard by the King at Shrewsbury, presents a feature which in regard of the Prior's alleged jurisdiction has not previously been noticed. \u2014 Ingelard de Stretton and Herbert Coli were found by the Court to have disseized Richard Iweyn and Isabel his wife of a messuage in Wenlock. Hereupon Aymo Prior of Wenlock came into Court and laid claim to his franchise (calumpniavit libertatem suam), saying that an assize of novel disseizin was not accustomed to be had within his Liberty, and that the Tenement now in dispute was of his Villanage. The successful Suitors were therefore obliged to compound this matter by a fine paid to the Prior, and \" they acknowledged that they could not enter on the premises except they had first satisfied the said Prior.\" A review of the various pleas which I have already recorded as affecting property within the Borough of Wenlock, will show that in no instance can a suit of novel disseizin be traced to any termina tion in the Curia Regis. This was partly a consequence of the Prior's Franchise in that respect ; but it is remarkable that no formal alle gation of such a Franchise had appeared on earlier Rolls. We shall presently have a hint that the seven Freemen of Wenlock could sue under writ of novel disseizin in the Curia Regis, whdst other Bur- gesses could only sue in the Prior's Court.

John le Provost was associated with the Prior in a matter of disseizin at Madeley.137 \u2014 One probably was the Officer of the other ; \u2014 but about this period I suppose that the Borough of Wenlock began to be governed by a corporate body. Towards the close of 1268, Sir Nicholas Fitz Martin was in eyre at Shrewsbury. Several inhabitants of Wenlock were in attendance, and were imprisoned by William de Caverswell, Sheriff, till he ex torted from them ten merks. Their names were Richard and Hamo Chamberlain (brothers), John Ichenard, Alan Hocheloth, Walter le Parmunter, and William le Knith.138 At the County Assizes of September 1272, William son of Juliana la Chantelere sued several persons, as Tenants, for a messuage &c. in Wenlock, whereof he alleged his said Mother to have died seized, he being her next heir. The cause was adjourned to January 20, at Worcester. At these same Assizes, a cause came on which implies a curious distinction between the Freemen and Burgesses of Wenlock. \u2014 Philip le Epeter and Agnes his wife sued Roger Aylrich of Ludlow and Isabel his wife for disseizing them of a messuage iu Wenlock. The King's Escheator came into Court, aud said that Wenlock Priory was in the King's hand by the death of the Prior ; that no new Prior was created at Wenlock nor represented by Attorney in Court; that there were only seven men of Weulock (he certainly meant the seven freemen) who could sue under a writ of novel dis seizin; and he asks the Court that this Suit may not be to the future prejudice of the unrepresented Prior. The Plaintiff (evidently because he was not one of the seven) took nothing.139 But these Salop Assizes of September 1272 involve a matter of much more general import as regards the Town of Wenlock. Now certainly, if not for the first time,140 did the Vill appear by its Jurors as a distinct Corporation from that which represented the Liberty. John Colv would seem to have been Bailiff, or Provost, both of the Liberty and of the Vill.

Hamo Chamberlain, Richard Fitz Richard, Herbert Coly, and Walter le Parmunter. The presentments of these Borough Jurors are not so prolix or so devoid of interest, but that they will bear to be recited. They reported how \u2014 Richard Chaplain of Harley, with his Sons Roger and Henry and Alice their Mother, were in company with Robert Fitz Madoc and Juliana his wife at a Tavern in Wenlock ; how Roger and Robert quarrelled, and the former so struck the latter with a staff upon the head, that death ensued the next day : furthermore, how Roger was imprisoned in Brug Castle while Hamo le Strange was Sheriff. \u2014 Hereupon the Court ordered the present Sheriff (Hugh de Mor timer) to summon his predecessor Hamo to appear before the Justices and give account of his Prisoner. The second presentment of the Wenlock Jurors regarded Philip de Northampton, a Monk, who had cut his own throat in the Priory. A verdict of Felo de se was hereupon recorded. The third presentment was as to Robert Fitz Robert of Kilmescote (Skimblescott), who, having been arrested for the death of Richard Fitz Reginald of Long Staunton, had escaped from the Prior's Gaol. Sentence on the Prior for this escape was reserved, but it appeared that Hugh de Mortimer (Sheriff of Shropshire) had already received \u00a35. from the said Prior for this matter. It also appeared that the Culprit, after his escape, took refuge in the Church of the Holy Trinity at Wenlock, and in the presence of the Coroner abjured the realm. Lastly, these Jurors represented how Richard Chamberlain (Came rarius) of Wenlock, Alan Fitz Alan of Wenlock, and Hamo le Chamberleyu, had been accused of larceny, imprisoned, and fined ten merks by William de Caverswell, late Sheriff.141 At the Inquisitions of November 1274, the Vill of Wenlock was represented by eleven Jurors distinct from the twelve who repre sented the Liberty. The eleven were, Richard Chamberlain, Alan Hocheleth, Richard Fitz Alice, William Fitz Adam, Hamo Cham berlain, Richard Fitz Robert, John Winel, Roger de Wiggewig, William Pres, Hamo Chese, and Roger de Harleg. Among other things, they presented several acts of extortion and wrong recently committed by the Sheriffs or Under-Sheriffs of the County, or by the Bailiff or Beadle of Munslow Hundred.

Vivian is to hold the premises for life, paying to Malcolumb a rent of one Rose, and doing all capital services. About this time, Roger le Knith of Wenlock releases by deed to the Priory all his right in a plot of ground situated near the new garden of the Monks.143 Under date of 1291, we have a statement of the Prior's income in Wenlock. It is difficult to fix exactly the localities from which this income arose, but it probably included the profits of land held in demesne by the Priory in and near Wenlock, also the rents of the Burgesses, whether arising from lands near to, or tenements within the Vill.144 In other respects the Valuation explains itself. \u2014 \u25a0 The Prior had in Wenlock five carucateslih of land which, at 18s. per carucate, yielded a revenue of \u00a34 10 0 Two acres of meadow at ls. 8d. per acre, yielded .034 The assized-rents were ...\" 800 The profits of Court, Fair, and Market, were ..200 Four Mills yielded annually 3174 Total . . \u00a318 10 8146 At the County Assizes of October 1292, the Vill of Wenlock again appeared by its Jury.147 The names given are Adam Arundel (Chief Bailiff), Richard Fitz Richard and John Wynel (Electors of the Jury), William de Barbur, Adam Wolrich, Hamo Chamberlain, Roger le Knyght, Richard Carewel, Wm. de Wyggeworth, Thos.

There was a Saxon Parish of St. Milburg, there was also an ancient Parish of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, and there is now a Parish of Much Wenlock. These three terms may sometimes be used indifferently, and wdl accidentally apply to the same subject matter; for instance, the Chapelry of Burton would, with equal correctness, be described as in either district. Nevertheless the three terms imply three spiritual jurisdictions of very unequal extent. The Saxon Parish of St. Milburg involved the Parish of the Holy Trinity, but was immeasurably greater, including Badger, Beckbury, Deuxhill, the two Millichopes; and, in short, if the Dictum of the Viceroy Belmeis is to be relied upon, every place which before his time had been identified as the \" Land of St. Milburg.\" Again, the ancient Parish of the Holy Trinity contained all the modern Parish of Much Wenlock, but much more besides. It included Broseley, Linley, Willey, and eight other places (pre- 155 Maintenance, that is, \u2014 not merely clothing. around Wenlock, \u2014 gardens, pools, budd ings, a mdl, 144 acres of pasture, and 286 acres of arable land.

The Church of the Holy Trinity, being then from time imme morial the Parish Church of its district, had little more to do with the Conventual Church than that it was of the patronage of the Prior. I take it to have been founded soon after Domesday, and to have been almost a corollary of the altered status of the Priory ; for, though the Church of Earl Leofric may well have involved a parochial cure, any such charge was not congenial to Clugniac Rule. Wenlock Parish Church was then, I suppose, for the first century of its existence, a Rectory in the gift of the Prior and Convent. The first distinct notice which I have of it is in a Charter of William de Vere,160 Bishop of Hereford (1186-1199), whereby he grants an appropriation thereof, and also of the Church of Eaton under-Haywood, to the Priory, his reason being the excessive hospitality which he knew to be exercised by the Monks of Wen lock. He allows the said Monks \"fully to convert into their own uses the Churches of the Holy Trinity of Wenlok and of Eatun, quit of all charge or custom of Bishops or their Officials ; also to receive tithes of all produce (frugum) and other things, taking cave to provide the officiating Chaplains of the said Churches with sufficient sustenance and reasonable salaries.\" Egidius (Giles de Braose, 1200-1216) inspects the Charter of Wdliam de Ver ; and, thinking it right to increase the \" benefices \" of the Monks, allows their appropriation of the aforesaid Churches.161 Thus the Church of the Holy Trinity became a Vicarage, but the question of the Vicar's endowment was for a long time un settled. The matter was referred to Papal Arbitration, and an edict of Pope Innocent IV (1243-1254) affected to determine it in this way. \u2014 If the portion of the Vicar were found, by estimation of good men, to be equal to twenty merks per annum, it should so remain : if it were less, then the difference should be made up by the Prior and Convent, \" who were in receipt of all the remaining income of the Church,\" according to the direction (ordinacionem) of the Diocesan Bishop.

This was done on the basis of the edict of Pope Innocent. The Prior and Vicar agreed that a valuation made by the Chaplains of Wenlock Parish, and other Chaplains acquainted with the case, together with twelve lawful men of the said Parish, should be binding on themselves. This Committee determined on oath that, to make the Vicarage worth twenty merks, the Vicar should receive the following, viz. : \u2014 his money from masses, and one-third of the candles of Churchings (purificationum) , and of funerals (defunctorum) : \u2014 Mortuaries (tes tamenta) of the eleven Vills which he had customardy received : \u2014 all small tithes of the Vills of Wenlock, Burton, West Bradele, Calloughton, Atterley, Walton, Presthope, Wike, and Bradele, with the hay-tithes of the same, except Wenlock, saving the usual mode of tithing to each Tenant of the Prior who had been used to pay him (the Prior) Cornmol : \u2014 163 nor was the Vicar to have any tithes from the Prior's demesnes if hereafter any part thereof should be given to a Tenant to cultivate : \u2014 all tithes of the Chapel of Benthall, with thirty acres of arable land pertaining to the same, saving tithes of demesne : \u2014 all tithes, except demesne tithes, of Linley Chapel, saving two merks due therefrom to the Convent Kitchen : \u2014 thirty thraves of wheat and oats in the vill of Burton, with the bread and money of masses : \u2014 ail the corn and money which was called Scrtfetoy,163 with the accustomed corn of Hopton, and 13 shillings rent in the vill of Wenlock. These things was the Vicar to receive as nominally equal to twenty merks and more; \u2014 and J. (John Breton), Bishop of Here ford, with his Official (representing the Archbishop) and the Prior and Convent, attached their respective seals to the decision, toge ther with the \" sign\" of the Vicar. \" This was done in full Con sistory in the greater Church of Lodelow, ou Saturday next after the feast of St. Gregory 1273 (i. e., Saturday, March 17, 1274) _164 102 Cornmol would seem, from another Charter, to be a local term, signifying tithe of sheep and other animals : \u2014 \" Re cipiat etiam decimam ovium et aliorum averiorum quod in partibus istis Cornmol appcllatur.\" I doubt however whether the term did not apply to a peculiar mode of assessing tithe, rather than to the particular produce assessed. 163 This word has evidently been changed by the Transcriber. Another Charter speaks of Schrysicorn as a local term for the corn offered by certain Parishioners of Wenlock at their confessions. m All this is taken from a transcript by Bowen, \u2014 among Lord Forester's Mu niments."], [311, "267 THE PARISH CHURCH. On Friday, October 2, 1282, John the Dean and the Chapter of Hereford inspected, recited, and confirmed the Charter of Bishop Giles de Braose above mentioned.165 On June 29, 1284, Richard de Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford, being at Tugford, granted a Charter to Wenlock Priory, which in its terms seems rather to be in favour of the Vicar of the Holy Trinity than of the Prior, though it does not concern their previous disputes. The Bishop had inspected certain Papal Letters which declared the Chapels of Shipton, Barrow, and Acton-Round to per tain to the Church of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock and the right of the Priory. Also he had learnt, from letters of Bishop William (de Vere), that \"all the land constituted oue Parish, and that the said Chapels, being constructed on the same land, belonged to the Mother Church of Wenlock.\" 166 He further found that, when J. (John Peckham) , Archbishop of Canterbury, was visiting Hereford Diocese, the Occupants of these three Chapels had appeared before two Commissaries of the said Archbishop, and confessed how the same Chapels pertained to the Church of the Holy Trinity, and how thereupon those Commissaries had given sentence. Now, the Bishop (Swinfield) deprives the Occupants of these Chapels, and recalls the Chapels into their pristine state, and commits the Cure of Souls therein to the Vicar of the Holy Trinity ; ordaining not only that the said Vicar's anciently taxed portion should remain to him, but that in augmentation thereof he should receive the corn offered by Parishioners of the vills of Weston, Muchale, and Hop ton, in their confessions, which (corn) was in those parts termed Schrysicorn: also he should receive the tithe of sheep and other animals, which (tithe) was in those parts called Cornmol; lastly, that the serving Chaplain of each said Chapel should pay him 2s. per annum.167 This is but a repetition of the oft- told tale, how in these matters of appropriation the grossest injustice was practised. The Prior ground down the Vicar, the Vicar in turn impoverished his sub ordinates, and they (tbe Chaplains) either starved their flocks or were themselves paupers. The Bishops moreover, doubtless for 165. 167 paL 22 Edw.

On April 21, 1290, Bishop Swinfield took the Parish Church of Wenlock in his Visitation, and in virtue of such Visitation was entertained at the cost of the Prior.168 The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Wenlock as belonging to the Prior, and values it at \u00a334. 13s. 4d. (fifty-two merks) per annum.169 It is obvious that this valuation is of the Rectory only. The Vicarage, in fact, was not taxed at all. I have spoken, under Broseley, of the Commission of January 18, 1332, before which it was proved that that Church had no cure of souls, being, in fact, within the limits of the Parish of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock. The witness who proved this went on to state that he had often beat the boundary of the Parish of the Church of Wenlock, and he described the same with great minuteness. \u2014 It will be sufficient here to say that, commencing at the South- East and going round by the South, West, North, and East, Wenlock Parish was stated to be bounded by these Parishes in succession, viz., by Morvdle (which included Astley Abbots, and Aston (Eyre) , by Upton (Cressets), Doditon (Priors Ditton), Staun ton (Long Stanton), Easthope, Cardington170 Harley, Shineton, Buildwas, Madeley, Sutton, and Stockton. In other words, the Parish of the Holy Trinity comprised the following districts wherein Churches or Chapels were then, or have since been, built, viz., Willey, Linley, Acton Round, Monk Hop ton, Shipton, Burton, Hugh-Ley, Church Preen, Barrow, Benthall, and Broseley. The Inquisition of the Ninth, taken in 1341, and having for its object a secular tax, estimated several of these Chapelries as dis tinct Parishes, e. g., Shipton, Acton Round, Barrow, Wdley, and Broseley. It is therefore difficult to determine the precise district which was taxed under the Parish of Wenlock. Whatever the district, the Church-Taxation (\u00a334. 13s. 4d.) was made the basis of the calculation, and was reduced to \u00a316. by the Assessors, for these reasons :\u2014 because the corn-lands had been unfruitful through 168 Bousehold Roll of Bishop Swinfield, page 76. The next day (AprU 22) the Bishop went to Oxenbold, where was a Park of the Prior's. His day's expenses were again nothing ; but it is carefully noted on the Roll that the entertainment, which on one day was matter of procura- tion, was in this case by invitation. 109 Pope Nich.

The whole of these resulted from his appropriation of the Church of the Holy Trinity, and amounted to \u00a343.172 In 1379, this same appropriation was valued by Inquest at \u00a344. 6s. 8c?.173 The Return of 1534-5 gives another arrangement. \u2014 The Rectorial Tithes of Wenlock Magna, which singly were \u00a34. 6s. 8d., should be added to the Rectorial Tithes of Shipton and Burton, and to Portions (as they are termed) from the Vills of Monk Hopton, Acton Round, Barrow, Presthope, Walton, Atturley, Wyke, Larden (and Brockton), Bradley, Arlscot, Calloughton, Wigwig (and Har ley), and Posenhall. The Total of \u00a335. 4s. must be taken as the Prior's Rectorial Income from the Parish of the Holy Trinity.174 In 1541-2, the Ministers' Accounts175 supply a nearly identical result (a Total of \u00a334. 2s. 4d.) from a different classification of items. Here the Rectory of Wenlock, when stated to be worth \u00a310. 6s. 8d., must be taken to include the Tithes of Burton, Walton, and perhaps other places. Besides this, we have the tithes of Weston, Monk Hopton, Monkhall, Shipton, Barrow, Atterley, Wigwig (and Harley), Presthope, Wyke, Benthall, Acton Round, aud Calloughton, separately valued, but amounting to \u00a323. 15s. 8d., which, with \u00a310. 6s. 8d., gives the above total of \u00a334. 2s. 4d. This I suppose to be a proximate valuation of the late Prior's appropriate rights in this Parish. As to the Vicarial income of Wenlock, that, though settled in 1274 at twenty merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8d.), and subsequently increased, was estimated in 1379 as only \u00a310.176 In 1534-5, we find another arrangement.

Roger, the first Vicar of whom I find dated mention, was Incum bent when the Vicarial income was settled, i.e., March 18, 1274. Peter, Vicar of Wenlock, perhaps succeeded Roger. All I can say of him is that he was Father of a Son, Richard, who was a Robber. The Borough Jurors of 1292 reported how this Richard, being pursued by John Russell, killed the latter with an arrow, and how Richard and his associate Maphowel, being \" fugitives of the peace,\" were overtaken and beheaded by the Bailiffs.179 John de Lodelawe, Chaplain, was instituted \" Parochial Vicar on March 28, 1291, at presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock.\" Walter de Cleobury, Priest, was instituted January 20, 1321, on a like presentation.

On November 28, 1336, he exchanged Preferments with \u2014 William de Kynardeseye, Priest, heretofore Rector of Eyton.

I have now to speak of such adjuncts of Much Wenlock as I suppose to have been included in the twenty hides which constituted the Domesday Manor. I will first take \u2014 BRADLEY, FORMERLY WEST BRADLEY. My former assumption that the place anciently distinguished as West Bradley was Bradley near Broseley184 has led me into much error. Finding the place in constant association with Broseley and Arlscot, I falsely concluded that it was contiguous to both. West Bradley was Bradley near Burton, and, though it is now in Burton Township, the two places were generally spoken of and treated as distinct estates, members of the Prior of Wenlock's com prehensive Fief. West Bradley was originally, I think, parcel of the Domesday Manor of Wenlock, rather than of Burton, and as such I treat of it here. It seems to have been chiefly held by the Lords of Broseley and their descendants under the Priory : and here I must correct some former misstatements. It was Bradley near Burton which was an escheat of Warin de Burwardsley's in 1194.185 It was for two carucates in this Bradley that Philip de Burwardsley was sued by Fulk Fitz Warin in 1230-4 ; and Warner, or Warin, de Bradley, who appears as Philip's Attorney on that occasion, and who attests one of his Charters,186 was probably his Nephew, \u2014 identical with Warin de Beysin, younger son of Philip's Sister Mabel. This Warin de Beysin then will have been seated at 181 Monasticon, VII, 773. 182 Patent, 51 Hen. III. 183 Patent, 3 Edw.

A deed which I shall give under Patton, and which is attested by Warin de Bradelegh, is strongly corrobora tive of this idea. Nevertheless it was not till 1244-5 that Mabel de Burwardsley, then first an acknowledged Coheiress, gave to her younger son Warin all her land of inheritance inArlscott and West Bradeleye. Her deed I have already given,187 under the false assump tion that it concerned Bradley near Broseley. Again we have had this Warin, under the name of Warin de Beysin, attesting a Deed of his Aunt Alice between 1244 and 1249. As I have said before, he was living in 1262 and had a daughter Margaret, if not a son Robert, who, being called at one time Robert de Arlscot, at another Robert de Beysin, seems to have inherited an interest in West Bradley which, late in the thirteenth century, he surrendered to the head of his family (probably his Suzerain and Cousin), Sir Walter de Beysin.188 Besides Robert and Margaret, I think Warin had other issue ; but my evidence is so slight on the subject, that I will only point out suggestively that at the Assizes of 1292, Richard son of Warin de West Bradley was reported by the Jurors of that liberty as a De faulter in the matter of due attendance. Besides the Burwardsleys and Beysins, the Prior of Wenlock had other Tenants in West Bradley ; \u2014 Tenants in fee I imagine ; \u2014 but in what I shall say of them I cannot always be sure that Bradley near Broseley was not the place concerned. In Michaelmas Term 1224,189 the Prior of Wenlock was suing, at Westminster, one whose name is written as Wdliam de Badele for half a virgate in Baddele, whereof the Prior alleged his predecessor Unbald (Humbald) to have been seized in Henry II's reign. The Defendant pleaded that Prior Unbald had conceded the premises to his Grandfather Wdliam, and he produced Humbald's Charter to that effect. Hereupon the Prior asked for a day of adjournment, that he might in the meantime satisfy himself by consultation with his Convent. The Court gave him the Quinzaine of Easter ; but I hear no more of the matter. About the middle of the same Century, one Richard de West bradele attests a Deed which I will give under Corfield. At the Assizes of 1272, William Fitz Hugh of Clun was found to have disseized Robert Rugge of Bradelegh of a right of common w Ibidem, p. 18. 188 Ibidem, p. 37. 1S9 Placita, 8 Hen. Ill, so. 11.

In 1296, an Inquest as to Tenures of Wenlock Priory was attended by Henry de Bradeley, who was also a Juror on the Great Peram bulation of the Forests of Shropshire, taken June 6, 1300, and who further attests a Larden and Shipton Deed in 1306. Cotcmporary with him was one Robert de Westbradleye, who in 1300 joined with Alice his wife in selling some land in Corve, as will hereafter appear. BENTHALL. Among those who attended the Viceroy's Court at Castle Holgate about a.d. 1115, the name of Anfred is observable.192 Possibly he was the same with Anffred de Benetala, who in 1120 attests a Charter of the Prior of Wenlock, which I shall give under Beckbury. In 1167, the Vills of Linglea and Benethala are mentioned con secutively as having been amerced half a merk each by the Justice of the Forest.193 Probably Linley and Benthall were the places con cerned. As far as I can judge from evidence of a not very conclusive cha racter, there lived towards the close of the twelfth century one Robert de Benthall, who held Benthall and several messuages in Wenlock under the Prior of Wenlock, and who also held something in Wichcote, near Great Sutton, under the Lords of Castle Holgate. This Robert de Benthall seems to have largely enfeoffed Syward le Champiun (otherwise called Syward de Franketon) in Benthall, but specially in four messuages, one virgate, and six acres of land there, \u2014 of which transfer more wdl be said presently. In October 1204, Robert de Benthall was deceased. He left a Widow Emma. She had much trouble in recovering her dower in Wichcott from Martin de Castello, who appears to have been her late husband's Tenant there, and who was afterwards Tenant of her son Robert. This second Robert de Benthall was a Minor in 1204, and was in ward to the Prior of Wenlock. Syward de Franketon, about this time I suppose, gave in frank- 190 Assize Roll, m. 12. 191 Rot.

The Assizes of November 1221 exhibit this Robert de Benthall as beset with all sorts of litigation. \u2014 He was found to have disseized Henry Fitz Thomas and Margery his wife of a Tenement in Wen lock.194 For this he was amerced half-a-merk, his Sureties being Remund and John de Benthal. Gilbert Fitz Walter and Erneburga de Berwewic also recovered their seizin of some tenement of which Robert de Benthall had disseized them.195 Again, Robert de Benethil recovered from Reginald de Legh three vassals (homines), whom Reginald had taken out of said Robert's seizin, and who acknowledged themselves to belong to the latter.196 Felicia de Wenlock failed to prosecute a charge of rape which she had made against Robert de Benthall. He was however tried and acquitted.197 Lastly, an Assize of Darrein Presentment concerning the Chapel of Benethal was moved by Robert de Benethal against the Prior of Wenlock, but it was compounded.198 \u2014 The Fine thus indicated is preserved. \u2014 It purports to be between Robert de Benethal, plaintiff, and Prior Humbert, Deforciant. The Plaintiff remits his claim for 2s.]9-> At, Warwick on January 14, 1222, the Prior of Wenlock called Robert de Benethal to warranty of three messuages in Wenlock. The Prior produced the Charter whereby said Robert conveyed to Prior Humbert all his lands in Wenlock, in exchange for lands and men in Benethal, which Siward de Franketon had given to the Priory. Robert acknowledged his obligation to give such warranty, which the Court ordered him to do on February 3 ; but it does not appear who disputed the Prior's right.200 194 Assizes, 6 Hen.

The Prior appeared, acknowledged that he had ingress by Syward, and that Syward had ingress by said Robert, but he denied that Syward's interest was a terminal one, nay, he produced the very Charter by which said Robert had given the premises in fee to Syward and his heirs. Sentence was accordingly given for the Prior.203 At the Forest-Assizes of February 1262, Philip de Benthal appears as a Regarder of the Long-Forest, and as subject to a fine for an improper return.203 In January 1266, Philip de Westcote (probably Wichcote) is complainant in a cause against Phdip de Benethal], but the hearing was adjourned.204 At Michaelmas 1267, the Sheriff charges Philip de Benthall with a fine for some non-attendance,205 and immediately afterwards both Phdip and William Hamund of Benthall sat on an Inquest specially taken before one of the King's Justices at Ludlow.206 At the County Assizes of 1272, Philip de Benthall was on the Jury for Wenlock Liberty, and is named as having sat on some \u25a0*\u2022- Rot.

Trilleck then suffered him to depart, without any royal warrant, but exacted the said fine from him and his Sureties.

He also gives them a right of road over all his Estate.209 Whether this Philip was akin to the Burnels, and, if not, how the Manor of Benthall passed from his line to the Burnels, I cannot discover.

Philip Burnel, who died in 1294, is said to have held these lands of John Burnell by service of doing suit to John's Court at Ben thall.212 Doubtless John Burnel held under the Prior of Wenlock, but it is strange that he, a Cadet of his house, should hold over its elder representative. On the death of Edward Burnell (son of Philip) in 1315, the said Edward's tenure of Benthal was found to have been immediate, under the Prior of Wenlock.313 A Charter of Buildwas Abbey is the next document which I shall quote as giving further account of the line of John Burnell.

The King's Writ issuant hereupon cost him a merk.218 In February 1262, William son of Hamo de Benthall was amerced Is. for vert. Of other persons taking name from this place, and probably resi dent here in 1272, sufficient mention has been made already.219 The Foreign Rent-Roll of Wenlock, taken in 1521-2, includes a Chief-rent of 4s. 6d. receivable from Robert Benthall. It was evi dently on the old Tenure noticed as held by Phdip de BenthaU in 1255. In 1541-2, among the receipts of the late Priory of Wenlock is a rent of 15s. 6d. receivable from a Messuage in BenthaU.220 BENTHALL CHURCH, OR CHAPEL\u2014 Was in existence before the year 1221, when, as we have seen, some indefinite but nearly valueless claim to the Advowson thereof was conceded by Robert de Benthall to the Prior of Wenlock. The Prior's right of patronage resulted in annexing the endow ment of this Chapelry to the Vicarage of the Holy Trinity of Wen lock. Benthall, I suppose, had at all times stood in the Parish of the Holy Trinity, and in 1274 the Great and Small Tithes of the Township, together with thirty acres of glebe there, were given to the Vicar. This distinctive mention of a local endowment, when coupled with Robert de Benthall's claim, points, I think, to the following 215 Charters at Willey. I Pipe, 43 Hen.

In course of time the endowment of the Daughter became an object to the Mother Church : the old plea of parochial jurisdiction was set up, and the said endowment con fiscated. In the case before us, the idea of subjection to Wenlock was attended by an extreme result. From the year 1274 to the Disso lution I find but one mention of Beuthall as a Chapelry.221 I doubt whether the Church, if it was left standing, was in any way served. The Valor of 1534-5 does not mention it, even as an adjunct of the Church of the Holy Trinity. Its subsequent restoration to the condition of a Perpetual Curacy, in the gift of the Vicar of Wenlock, was probably suggested by some traditionary remembrance of its older status. BARROW\u2014 Another member of the Domesday Manor of Wenlock, seems to have been held in demesne by the successive Priors. I cannot positively instance the name of a single Under-Tenant here during the two Centuries of which I treat; nor is it worth whde to mention several trivial occurrences of the name \"De Barewe,\" which I meet with in Shropshire Records. The name, of itself, merely indicates that its bearer lived near some barrow or tumulus, not that he was resident in the particular locality now under notice. In their territorial arrangements the Priors of Wenlock seemed to have classed Barrow as a member of their great Manor or Grange of The Marsh. There it will be again mentioned. Meanwhile something should be said distinctively of \u2014 Barrow Church, a building which proves its own antiquity. The structure belongs to a period to which written testimony seldom extends,222 and I have no such evidence of its existence till the in- 221 The Chapel of Benthall is men tioned in Bishop Charlton's Confirmation to Wenlock Priory in 1331, but only as a Dependency of the Church of the Holy Trinity.\u2014 Arlscot.

But in 1341, the Parish of \" Barewe \" was taxed to the ninth as a distinct Chapelry, the Church Taxation of \u00a34. 6s. 8d. being made the basis of the temporal assessment. The latter was however reduced to \u00a31. 14s. for several causes, viz., because the corn was deficient from an unfavourable season, because there were no sheep in the parish, because several tenants were too poor to till their lands, and because the glebe-land and altarages went to increase the Church taxation, and could not be estimated in the present assessment.225 A valuation of 1369 gives, among the Spiritualities of the Prior of Wenlock, \u00a34. receivable annually from the Chapel of Barow. Another statement shows that the tithes of Barrow were devoted to the sustenance of the Monks.226 The Valor of 1534-5 makes no other mention of this Church and Parish than that the Prior had a portion of 40s. derivable from the Vill.\"7 The Early Incumbents of Barrow are mentioned with little regularity in the Diocesan Registers.228 John de Wicumbe was instituted as Rector January 17, 1277, on presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock. Later in the year the Living was sequestered, by reason of the Incumbent's neglect to take Orders. It was released from Sequestration on Nov. 8. James de Tyceford was the Rector of Barrow who was deprived in 1284. He was perhaps a relation of the cotemporary Prior.

This Richard was deceased or had resigned in 1321, and on November 30 of that year \u2014 Sir Hamo Corn became Chaplain by the following curious and, as I imagine, dlegal process in the Prior's Court. \u2014 \" Brother Guy chard, Prior of Wenlock, delivered and demised to the said Sir Hamo all lauds and tenements pertaining to his (the Prior's) Chapel of Barewe, both in the Vills of Barewe and of Posenhale, together with the altarages and oblations of the said Chapel ; \u2014 to hold and receive, for life of said Hamo. The said Hamo should serve the Chapel by one Priest (himself or another) and one Clerk. The Prior and Convent should bear all burdens, ordinary or extraordi nary, lying on said Chapel. Hamo was to build a new grange in ihe Rectory -Close of the Chapel, and to maintain all other buildings, there or at Posenal, in good repair, receiving Housbote and Haybote from the Prior's Wood-warden, and also fire-wood when he was resident. Hamo was to pay the Prior a rent of twelve Capons at Easter. If Hamo appointed a Deputy as Chaplain, such Deputy was to have a specified quantity of fire-wood out of the Prior's woods, and no more.\" On June 28, 1322, I find that Hamo Corn, Chaplain, and Alice his Sister, fined 3s. 4d. with the Prior, for three-and-a-half acres of land, which Richard, son of Chaplain Richard of Barewe, had previ ously held : \u2014 to hold to said Hamo and Alice, for the Use of the Survivor of them, at a rent of 3d. per acre.

This arose from two carucates of arable land, and from certain rents in Wenlock- Walton, Atturley, and Barrow. \u2014 The Prior's part of Shirlot Forest was also estimated under the Marsh Grange, but the profit thereof was inappreciable, as there was no underwood, and the pasturage was common.233 In 1390, the Marsh Manor is valued at \u00a322. 11s. 9d. per annum, but no particulars of the rents, herein included, are given. The Pleas of the Manor-Court and Fines contributed \u00a31. 14s. of the gross sum.234 A Rental of the Marsh Manor taken in the time of Prior Roland Bruge includes rents in Atterley, Walton, Barrow, Wyke, Bradley, Posnall, Benthall, Wigwig, Harley, and Hanstrey (the last expressed to be 5s. for Wdley Mill).235 In 1534, the rents and /eras included under the Marsh amounted to \u00a347. 19s. 10\\d., of which \u00a33. 6s. 8d. went to the Salary of the Prior's Bailiff there.236 In 1541-2, the rents similarly classified under Marsh were \u00a343. 9s. 6d. ; and Barrow, Benthall, Atterley, Posnall, Broseley, and Presthope, each contributed a portion thereof.

The arrow had been given to the keeping of the Vills of Atterleg, Walton, Monkley, and Barrow; and the same Vills were said to be in misericordid, because they appeared not before the Justices, nor produced the arrow in Court. At the Assizes of August 1267, William de Walton was found to have died seized of a messuage and noke of land in Atterleye, which Christiana his daughter now recovered from Richard Fitz Henry. At the Inquisitions of Nov. 1274, Roger le Surreys of Atterley sat as a Juror of Wenlock Liberty.238 Philip Burnel, who died in 1294, held lands in Atterley of the Prior of Wenlock.239 How he acquired them I cannot say. I conclude my notice of Walton and Atterley with one or two extracts from the Manorial Fine-Roll before quoted. \u2014 On Sunday, Feb. 14, 1322, the Lord (i. e., the Prior of Wenlock) conceded to Robert de Walton, for a term of twenty years, all the messuage and lands in Walton, which Roger le Bonde had surren dered by reason of poverty (impotenciam) . \u2014 Rent to be 16s. yearly.

The Priors of Wenlock seem to have granted no feoffments in this member of their Manor of Wenlock. They treated Bradley (near Broseley) as Caput of a demesne estate. In 1291, the Prior's assized rents in Bradeleye being only 10s., he had four carucates in demesne there, and an acre of meadow, valued at \u00a31. 6s. 8d. and 2s. respectively. Total, \u00a31. 18s. 8d.ul In 1379, Bradeley Grange appears as the Caput of the Prior's in terests in the Hamlets of Wyke, Bradeley (near Broseley), BenthaU, Posenall, Wigwig, and Harley. The Houses attached to Bradeley Grange netted nothing : a carucate of land there yielded 6s. 8d. per annum; two acres of meadow yielded Is., besides 8d. for after-math. A water-mill near Wigwig yielded 10s. The assized rents of the hamlets aforesaid, \" annexed \" to this Grange, were of free tenants, and amounted to \u00a36. 10s. 5d. per annum. The pleas and perquisites of Court were 2s. Total, \u00a37. 11s. 9d. Some demesne land at Wigwig belongs apparently to a different item.-\u00ae In 1390, and at all subsequent periods, Bradley Grange, with Wyke and its other dependencies above mentioned, were estimated and valued as adjuncts of the Marsh Manor. Under that head I have given further account of them.213 Wyke and Farley. \u2014 A fine was levied at Salop on Nov. 8, 1221, between Richard Buret, Plaintiff, and Humbert Prior of Wenlock, Tenant, of thirty acres in Wenlock and nine acres in Wyke, whereof was assize of mort d'ancestre.

One family took name from the place. Thus I find mention of Henry de Calewinton early in the thirteenth Century ; of Peter son of Peter de Calweton about the middle of the same century, but who in December 1258 occurs simply as Peter de Calweton. In 1274, the Munslow Jurors complained how John del Ewe, Constable of Corfham, had sent two men to Kalveton in the Prior of Wenlock's Liberty, to the house of Peter de Kalveton, and how those men had seized there seventy sheep of Henry de Stretton the Provost, and had driven them to Corfham, where the said Constable disposed of the sheep as he listed.263 The same, or another Peter de Caleweton, occurs on a local Jury in November 1291. A family named Clerk also had a tenancy here. Of them I have somewhat fuller particulars. \u2014 In Michaelmas Term 1224, Alice, widow of Hamo Clerk, sued the Prior of Wenlock, at Westminster, for her dower, and, inter alia, for half a virgate in Kalweton. The Prior's plea was, that he was not Tenant of the premises, for that the actual Tenants were several persons to whom Hamo had mortgaged the same. The Prior further stated that his own chief-rent (servitium) chargeable on the premises was in arrear, but that he was ready to assist the Prose cutrix in recovering her dower. The Court allowed her to sue out another writ.264 Such further Writ was, of course, against the actual Tenants. Accordingly, in Michaelmas Term 1225, the same Alice sues William Fitz Adam for half an acre, and Hamo Fitz Henry for two-thirds of an acre, in Kaleweton.

In Michaelmas Term 1267, Ernald Fitz Robert of Walton was suing Agatha, Widow of William le Clerk, for disseizing him of a messuage in Kaleweton.

The cause was adjourned tdl the Justices should be in Eyre?68 By Fine levied at Westminster, July 8, 1285, Adam de Haynho and Isolda his wife conceded, as their gift to John Wilde of Wenlok, a messuage and six acres in Apterlegh (probably Atterley) and Caleweton : \u2014 to hold of the Grantors and the Heirs of Isolda, at a rent of one Rose. John paid 20s.269 It appears, from the valuation of 1291, that the income derived from two carucates of land in Calloughton (written Coleton) had been speciady appropriated by the Founder of Wenlock Priory to the Pittance of the Monks, wherefore it was not reckoned among the general receipts of the House.270 In 1379, the Hamlet of Calweton contained a capital messuage yielding nothing beyond expenses. Two carucates of land there were worth 6*. 8d., two acres of meadow, 2*. per annum. The assized rents of free Tenants were 20s. Total, \u00a31. 8s. 8d?71 The Valuation of the Priory estates taken in 1390 does not men tion Calloughton at ad, probably because of the specific appropria tion of its rents to the Convent Kitchen. This we learn more fully from a \" Kitchen Rental \" of 1495-6, which includes the Rents of fifteen Tenements in Calloughton, one of which is \u00a33. sis. 8d. for the demesne lands there, fermed by Roger Frances.

This was, with the exception of West Bradley, the most distant of the many Vills which may be presumed to have been included in the Domesday Manor of Much Wenlock. The Priors must have granted some very early feoffment here. In the year 1167, when the Prior's demesnes were amerced one merk by Justices of the Forest, Presthope, apparently as a distinct tenure, was amerced half a merk. Ralph de Presthope, the earliest whom I can suggest as the Prior's Feoffee here, lived in the twelfth century. Roger, son of Ralph de Prestop, appears, by some extraordinary chance, as a Grantee of lands at Bonedle (now Bentley), a place situated on the River Treut, and in the Staffordshire Manor of Mavesyn Ridware.275 His Feoffor was Sir Wdliam Malveisin of Ridware, a great Vassal of the Shropshire house of Fitz Alan. The three first witnesses of the Deed of Feoffment are Warin de Burwardesley, Warner de Wililey, and Hugh de Leia, aU neighbours of the Grantee/m Shropshire. The end of the twelfth century was probably the period of this grant. This was that Roger de Presthope who, having murdered his neighbour John de Patinton, gave King John two palfreys that he might have letters-patent of the King revoking the outlawry which had been proclaimed against him for this crime. John Mareschal, who appears as security for this Fine, was at the time Custos of Fitz Alan's Barony in Shropshire.276 The Letters-Patent sought appear on the Rods, bearing date at Clarendon, January 25, 1214. They couvey, as was usual in such cases, only the \" King's peace.\" The accused was to take his trial, if any one else chose to prosecute him (ita quod stet recto si quis versus eum inde loqui voluerit) ?77 Besides these Letters-Patent, a Writ- Close was addressed to the Sheriff of Shropshire, ordering him to restore ad such lands and goods of the accused as had been seized for the Crown, \"when palfreys was commuted for one of eleven merks, which Presthope paid in 1214 and 1218.

Herbert, the Brother, and Juliana, the wife of the deceased, made their challenge against the accused.\" 278 At the next County Assizes (November 1221), the Munslow Jurors, according to the usual form, made presentment of this murder. Roger de Presthope produced the late King's Letters- Patent, and was dismissed by the Court sine die. \" And,\" adds the Record, \" be it known, that he was not outlawed.\" At these same Assizes, an entry, under Overs Hundred, intimates that Roger de Presthope proffers a fine of 100s. pro habendo auxilio, his Security being the Prior of Wenlock.279 This had no con nection with his previous crime, but it is difficult to say what this Fine was for. Roger de Presthope was still paying instalments thereof in 1225. Again at these Assizes, Roger de Prestehop was found to have unjustly disseized Margery, daughter of Robert Menske, of a Tene ment in Prestehop. The damages awarded were 3s., for which Widiam Hubert and John de Bolinton were Securities.380 Again, Roger Fitz John succeeded, under suit of mort d'ancestre, in recovering a virgate in Prestehop against Roger de Prestehop, the holder, whose plea was, that the Plaintiff's Father was a Tenant in Villanage. The Jury found him to have been a Tenant in Fee, and to have died seized of the premises. The Surety for Roger de Presthope's amercement in this instance was Richard de Linleg.281 Soon after, this Roger de Presthope attests Prior Humbert's Charter to Thomas de Bagsore, the next witness being, singularly enough, Stephen de Patinton,282 the son probably, certainly the heir, of the man whom Presthop had slain. A later attestation of Roger de Presthope has been before instanced,283 viz., about 1230.

The said Nicholas, with consent of the said Alice (whose parentage his Deed describes), grants to Ralph, son of Roger de Presthope, an acre of land in the field of Presthope.284 This appears to me to have been a sur render of the tenure of a younger branch to the Lord of the fee, and, if I state this genealogy correctly, Alice was first Cousin of the Grantee. Ralph, son of Roger de Presthop, appears as Ralph de Presthop, attesting a Lutwyche Deed about 1245. In September 1253, he similarly appears on a great Jury of the County which had to ascer tain the right of Patronage to Haughmond Abbey. At the Inquisition of Tenures in Wenlock Liberty, in 1255, Ralph de Prestehop was a Juror. Described as Ralph Fitz Roger, he is said to hold only one part of the Vill of Presthop of the Prior of Wenlock, paying a rent of 16s. 6d. per annum, and doing Suit to the Prior's Court, as his ancestors, tiU the reign of Richard I, had done Suit to Munslow Hundred. The Prior himself was Lord of the other part of the Vill, i.e., held it in demesne. The whole was estimated to contain one hide.285 At the Assizes of January 1256, Ralph de Presthop was again a Juror for Wenlock Liberty. In February ]262, he appears as a Regarder of the Long Forest in particular, but a Verderer of the Shropshire Forests in general. Before the year 1272, we have John de Presthope attesting a Broseley Deed ;286 and this was the name of the head of the house of Presthope for fifty years following. Besides his many attestations of undated Charters, John de Presthope appears on a Shrewsbury Jury in December 1285 ; on a Wenlock Jury, October 1289; and at the Assizes of 1292 he sat as a Juror for the Liberty of Wenlock. Again he was on a Wen lock Jury in May 1296, on an Easthope Jury in February 1306, and attested a Larden deed in July of the same year. In March 1316, he was returned as Lord of the Vill of Prest hope.287 In September 1321 (as I suppose the date to be) he attests, with Thomas his son, a Wilderhope Deed ; and again in 1322-3, 284 Dugdale's MSS.

Of Under-tenants in this Manor I can say little more than has been implied already. At the Assizes of 1272, Richard, son of Peter de Prestehop, vainly sued Warin Fitz Warin of Wenlock for a messuage and virgate in Prestehop, but had leave to pursue his cause in another form. On 25th June 1278, the King directs the Sheriff of Shropshire to ascertain whether certain lands held by William Fitz Arnald of Prestehop and Thomas Fitz Adam of Bromcroft, within the limits of the Long Forest, were measured by proper perches according to the assize of the Forest, and fairly arrentated. An Inquest held at Gipholes by the Sheriff and others, found that five acres and two roods thus held in Gipholes were properly measured, and were worth a rent of 18d. per acre ; also that William and Thomas held two acres of the Lord of Kenley by service of 10s. rent.288 Fodowing my ordinary plan of tracing all Monastic Seigneuries, tdl the Dissolution effaced them, I find, from the \" Foreign Rent Roll\" of Wenlock Priory, that in 1521-2 the Prior's principal Tenant at Presthope (Humphrey Wolriche) paid a chief-rent of 18s. 6d., while three other rents there amounted to 17s. ld?S9 After the Dissolution, viz., in 1541-2, a \"Free Rent\" of \u00a31. from \"Heth Presthorpe\" is entered among the Assets of the late Priory.290 Besides this, the Prior received \u00a32. from Presthope for tithes ; and this Sum does not vary in either of the three instances 291 where I find the item set forth. In one case (the Valor of 1534-5), it is described as a Portion receivable from the Vill of Presthop. In 1541-2, it stands as the Ferm of the Tithes of Presthorp. PRESTENDEN. This Vill was, I suppose, a member of the Domesday Manor of Wenlock ;\u2014 but the Priors granted very early feoffment thereof, for we happen to know that one Walter de Plesentia held half a virgate here under Priors Rainald and Humbald. Though the place cannot now be identified, I think it probable that it was near Presthope or West Bradley. Some interesting documents concern this lost locality. \u2014 288 Inquisitions, 6 Edw.

The original feoffment at 3s. rent is stated to have been given by Priors Rainald and Humbald, and we have seen that it was maintained by Prior Henry. Now, the 3s. rent is increased to 5s. The Grantee was to sed beer in his house at Wenlock, free of toll if he sold it himself, but not so if any one else sold it. This deed passed after the last, and before 1198, but probably very early in the interval, for six out of the ten names mentioned may be identified with six witnesses of Gervase Paganel's grant, already quoted, and supposed to have passed about 1180.293 From two somewhat inaccurate copies of this curious Deed, I endeavour to restore the original.294 \u2014 \" Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Robertus Prior de Wenloke ex peticione et concensu totius conventus concedo et hac carta, con firmo Waltero filio Walteri de Plesente illam dimidiam virgatam terr\u00e6 in Prestesdena quam antecessores mei Rainaldus videlicet (et) Humbaldus Priores patri ejus pro suo servicio concesserunt, ad tenendam de nobis libere et quiete, tarn ipse quam heredes sui pro tribus solidis annuatim reddendis.

The Vill of Prestenden was stdl existent in 13 Henry VIII (1521-2) .

King Henry I and his Successors, visiting their own Castle of Brug, or as Guests of the Prior of Wenlock, had obvious grounds for perpetuating at Shirlot those exclusive rights which belonged to every Royal Chace. There were two \" Hayes \" in Shirlot Forest which were retained absolutely in demesne, viz., Shirlot Haye and Bentley Haye. The latter was near Walton, and of inconsiderable extent. Shirlot Haye, not very great when compared with such a Forest as Morf, had yet a very wide regard or jurisdiction. And this jurisdiction originady extended to certain other woods, which belonged nomi nally to indifferent persons; but the property of such persons therein was much limited and questioned, till such time as any of these subject woods came, by special concession of the Crown, to be placed out of regard. Thus we have supposed that Earl Hugh de Montgomery gave to Wenlock Priory the tithe of all Venison which he took in the \" Woods of St. Milburg,\" a matter which may be thus explained : \u2014 The \" woods of St. Milburg \" were already the Prior's woods, after a fashion, that is, he had no right to take Venison therein himself, because they were within regard of Shirlot, or some other of the Earl Palatine's Forests. I will not recapitulate the various entries which I have already extracted from the Forest Rolls of 1180, 1.209, and 1262, and which furnish many incidental illustrations as to the jurisdiction of Shirlot Forest. Neither wiU I repeat what I have said as to the Custody or Forestership of Shirlot, and the family which held that office hereditarily.1 I wdl pass to other general matters, adding by the way such minor incidents as have not yet been noticed. \u2014 In 1190, the Prior of Wenlock gave the King twenty merks that he might have the Wood of Sirlet (that is, his own part of the wood) exempt from the Vieiv of Foresters (that is, taken out of Regard). In 1209, the Justices in Eyre ordered the Vivary of Scirlegh (whose it was does not appear) to be seized into the King's hands, because a stag had been drowned therein.2 At the Forest Assizes of 1231, Hugh Fitz Robert (Chief Forester of Shropshire) and his fedows accounted 20s. for timber sold out of the Haye of Chirlet.3 Pursuant to the King's Writ of October 21, 1235,4 Four Knights 1 Vol. II, pp. 73-75. 3 Rot.

Their report I give literally: \u2014 \" Item, \u2014 the Bosc of Sirlet was viewed, to wit, the Haye of the Lord King ; and its custody is good as regards oak-trees and under wood, except that great deliveries have been made by order of the King to the Abbeys of Salop and Bildewas, to the Priory of Wen lock, to the Castle of Brug for the repair of buildings, and elsewhere in many places.

The ancient Jurisdiction of Shirlot Forest will best be estimated by a list of those Vidages and Lands which were formally taken out of its Regard in the reign of Edward I : but I must observe that some of the Vills now to be named had been partially or wholly exempted from Regard at earlier periods ; perhaps also one or two places, omitted to be mentioned, were yet at some similar periods within regard of Shirlot. \u2014 The List is as follows : \u2014 The Vills of Beddeleswerdyn (Belswardine) , Scheynton (Shine ton), Buldwyas Magna (i. e., the Abbey Manor), Benthale, Posnall, Walton (near Wenlock), Atterley, Barrow, Willey, Dean, Bold, Linley, Caughley, Little Caughley, Rowton, Swinney, Appeleye (the only vill eastward of Severn), Colemore, Stanley, Rucroft, in. 38"], [346, "298 SHIRLOT FOREST.

The second and more formal perambulation made in 1300, and confirmed by the same King Feb. 14, 1301, does not mention ad these places, but adds others which belong doubtless to the Shirlot Catalogue. Such are Wyke and Arlscot (near Broseley), Much Wenlock, Bradelegh (near Broseley), Broseley itself, Eudon Savage (now Eudon George), half Eudon Burnell, Walkeslowe (Walkers low), the Bosc of Overton (near Walkerslow), the vill of Brug (i. e., the High Town), with the fields adjacent, and half the vill of Erdinton, with its woods, wastes, and plains.7 Other Records, which it would be tedious to recite here, mention Sidnall, Muckley, Acton Round, Sidbury, Aston Botterell, Cherlcot, Glazeley, and Wrickton, under circumstances which almost prove them to have been sometime within the bounds of this jurisdiction. In short, the ancient jurisdiction of Shirlot Forest pervaded a territory which cannot be described by boundaries either natural or conventional, neither by mountains nor streams, nor yet by Hun dreds. The bulk of the district however lay within an arc of the Severn, if we take the course of that River from Buildwas Abbey to the Knowle Sands.

It may please the local Antiquary to trace in modern localities the names of some of those land-marks which by the perambulation of 1300 limited from thenceforth both the Forest and Jurisdiction of Shirlot. \u2014 From Yapenacres Merwey the boundary was to go up to the Raveneshok (Raven's Oak), thence straight to Brewalle grene, then down to Romesedene-siche ; 8 thence straight to the Merewey, near the Coleherth (Coal-hearth), going up by the Fendeshok (Fiend's Oak) to the Dernewhite-ford.

And thus by the assarts which John de Haldenham (Aldenham) holds at a rent of the King to the corner of Mokeleyes-rowe (Muckley-row). And thence down to Yapenacres Merwey, where the first land-mark of the said Haye begins. There was moreover a certain parcel (placia) of Bosc which the King still held in the same Forest ; it was called Benthlegh-haye (Bentley-haye), but its bounds are not given. Among the Assets of the late Priory of Wenlock, as enumerated in 1541-2, the Revenue derived from Shirlot shows well how the Laws of the Forest had given way to the Laws of human progress. The Priory had had a mine for ironstone at Shirlot, which was fermed for \u00a32. 6s. 8d. per annum. The/en\u00bb of a Forge (described as an Ierne Smythee, or a Smith's place) in Shirlot was \u00a312. 8s.

Domesday speaks of this Manor as follows \u2022? \u2014 \"The same Church (St. Milburg's) held, and still holds, Bur tune, and Edric (holds it) of the Church.

I conceive him to be the same person with Adric de Wenlock, who has been already noticed.3 \u2014 Though a Saxon, his tenure under the Church of St. Milburg seems to have secured him some protection and favour. Nevertheless I do not find that, at any later period than Domesday, Burton was held by a Feoffee of the Priory. It passed wholly into the demesne of the Monks, and was in fact the locality selected for holding the Hun dred Courts of their Franchise. I have already given instances where Manors within the said Franchise are said to owe suit to the Greater or Lesser Hundred-Courts of Burton. The former were held twice yearly, the latter every three weeks. Other instances will occur of a similar obligation. Here I should notice, how at the Inquest of 1255, the Jurors of Wenlock Liberty returned Bur ton as the Vill of the Prior (that is, held by him in demesne), and how the same Jurors gave the hidage of the Manor as two hides and three virgates,\u2014 exactly the Domesday estimate.4 The Jurors of the Liberty of Wenlock, in November 1274, re- 1 Fol. 252, b. 2. plain hereafter. 2 Non poterat recedere ab ecclesid; \u2014 an expression which I will attempt to ex- 3 Vol. I, p. 112. 4 Rot.

Id., and how at last Trillek had released them from imprisonment without plevin. A similar outrage had been committed on the persons and goods of the wife and son of Wdliam de la Pirie of Bourton, who had also been released without plevin.5 In 1291, the Prior of Wenlock is stated to derive an income of \u00a35. 16s. from his Manor of Bourton, viz., from two carucates of arable land, \u00a32. ; from three acres of meadow, 6s. ; from assized rents and a mid, \u00a31. 6s. 8d.; from t ullage, \u00a31. 3s. 4d.; from perquisites (of Court) and dues in the shape of manual labour, \u00a31.6 The Court-Rod of 15 Edward II supplies the following Fines relating to Burton, and illustrative of local tenures and customs which had probably existed from time immemorial. \u2014 Oct. 7, 1321.\u2014 Richard son of Hugh On-the-Hill fined 20s. for the messuage and land late held by Hugh his Father.

Total, \u00a38. 8s. 8d. There were two great Hundred-Courts held by the Prior at Burton yearly, viz., at Easter and Michaelmas. Of these Courts the Pleas and Perquisites realized \u00a31. per annum. The Pleas and Perquisites of the Lesser Hundred-Court, held every three weeks, were worth 6s. 8c?. per annum. There were also diverse free Tenants within the County who held in socage various tenements under the Priory, and who owed suit to the aforesaid Hundred-Court, and whose annual rents amounted altogether to \u00a36. 13s. 4d? A Valuation of the Prior's possessions, taken in 1390, gives the annual receipts from Burton Manor at \u00a310. 11s.

This Dependency seems to have resulted in some thing like absorption ; for neither of Church, Chapel, or Chaplain at Burton do I hear again till after the Dissolution. J^jnptom Sceaptun was probably the Saxon name of this place; and it is one of that multitude of local names which originated with a race devoted to pastoral and agricultural pursuits. \"The Church of St. Mdburg held Scipetune in Saxon times, and stdl retained it at the date of Domesday.

It had thus preserved its Domesday measurement.2 In 1291 the Prior held in his Manor of Shipton one carucate in demesne, of \u00a31. annual value. Two acres of meadow were worth 4s. The Assized Rents and a Mid realized \u00a32 ; the annual Tallage, \u00a31.; the Perquisites of the Manor-Court, and the dues in the form of manual labour, were estimated at 5s.

Hugh shall give the Lord 2s. on August 1st next for maintaining this agree ment.\" On June 24, 1322, Roger de Esthope resigned into the Lord's hands the Mill of Schipton. Roger Schakel of Syenton took the same for his life, paying an entrance-fee of 10s., and covenanting to pay an annual rent of five merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8c?.), and to keep the said Mdl in good repair, the Lord finding timber \"in the rough\" for that purpose. In the Valuation of 1379, the receipts from Shipton (where the Prior had neither Capital Messuage nor demesne lands) were \u00a39. 18s. : viz., for two acres of meadow, 2s.; for a water-mdl, 12s.; for Assized Rents of Free Tenants, \u00a39. 4s.

The claim was doubtless one of ecclesiastical independence, asserting Shipton Church to be no affiliation of the Church of St. Milburg. Grenta, the claimant, was probably the Incumbent of Shipton, and his discomfiture must needs be of date about a.d. 1110. At a long interval, viz., on May 22, 1275, we hear of John de Wyno, Subdeacon, being instituted to this Church on presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock.11 He is said to have been deprived in 1282. And this may well be the case; for in the pre vious year John de Peckham Archbishop of Canterbury visited the Diocese of Hereford, and, as we have already seen,12 his Commis saries gave sentence as to the subjection of the Chapel of Schypton to the Church of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, and the Incumbent of Shipton, \"John de Eynho,\" acknowledged that subjection. Further, we have seen13 how, on January 29, 1284, Richard Bishop of Hereford, recording the deprivation of John de Eynho, ordained that the \"Chaplain\" who served the Chapel of Schypton should pay 2s. annually to the Vicar of Wenlock. In 1291 the Church or Chapel of Shipton is returned as belong ing to the Prior of Wenlock, and as of \u00a36. annual value.14 In his general Charter, dated May 23, 1331, Thomas Bishop of Hereford enumerates Shiptone among the \"Chapels dependent on the Church of the Holy Trinity.\" In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth charged this Parish, or rather district, with \u00a3.2. 5s. instead of \u00a36. The reasons were, that the corn was in great part destroyed, there were no sheep here, a third of the land lay unfilled from inabdity of the Tenants, and the glebe and altarages of the Chapel went to swell the Church Taxation, but could not be reckoned in assessing the Ninth.15 In the year 1369 the Prior of Wenlock was receiving \u00a313. 6s. 8c?. from Shipton Chapel,16 which of course was served by a mere Deputy at the time, officiating without any institution or Episcopal license. In 1534-5 the Rectorial or Corn-tithes of Shipton were returned under the Spiritualities of the Prior of Wenlock as worth \u00a35. 6s. 8e?. per annum ; and a Portion, as it is called, receivable from the Vills 11 Blakeway's MSS., from Hereford Re gisters. There seems to me to be some question about the date of institution being correctly given. The See of Here ford was vacant at the time. 12- 13 Supra, p. 267. 14 Pope Nich.

LARDEN, FORMERLY LAVERDEN. This place is not mentioned in Domesday, being then involved in Shipton. The etymology of the name, and its successive changes, are curious. \u2014 The same usage which has contracted the Saxon word Hlappb (Hlaford) into the modern \" Lord,\" has changed Hlappb-ben (i. e., Lord's Valley) first into Laverden, and now into Larden. The earliest mention which has occurred to me of this place seems to intimate its manorial separation from Shipton. In the year 1167 a fine of 6s 8c?. is assessed by Alan de Nevill on Leverdon Prioris, i. e., Prior's-Leverdon.18 The fact is, that whilst the Prior continued to hold Shipton in demesne, he granted one or more early feoffments in Larden. Thus the status of the two places became dissimilar, and the evidences which we have about one are of a class essentially distinct from those which we have about the other. The Tenants in Fee of Larden took name from the place. The first of whom I find mention was Roger de Lavendene, who has already been named as attesting a Badger Deed about 1174.19 On Sept. 26, 1199, a Fine was levied at Salop, which I associate with this place. \u2014 It was between Richard de Hungerford, plaintiff, and Odo de Leverton, tenant, of a quarter-virgate in La More, whereof was recognition of mort d'ancestre. \u2014 Richard renounced his claim for 10s. paid to himself, and 10s. more to Walter Fitz Radulf, his elder Brother, who was present in Court, and consent ing to the Fine.20 In October 1199, I find one William de Leferden a Recognizor in a Suit concerning land at Clee St. Margaret;21 and in November 1201, Odo de Loverdon and William de Loverdou appear to be the names of two Recognizors in a great Shropshire cause long pend- ing at Westminster.22 At the County Assizes, Nov. 1221, William de Laverden was 17 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, p. 216.

Laurence's Grandfather and two Aunts had sometime sued the Prior of Wenlock for a virgate in Laverden, as their right in pourparty. At length they obtained their object by paying the Prior six merks, whereof two merks were paid by Laurence's Guardian, his Grandfather being, I suppose, dead. Laurence in time had full seizin of his share, and held it till William de Laverden disseized him. On March 12, 1227, William de Laverdene, Thomas de Laver dene, and Walter More, were in attendance at the Prior's Court at Burton. This we learn from their attestation of a Deed which passed in the said Court. I imagine them to have been the Prior's Tenants at Larden and Moore House. Within the next ten years the following Deeds seem to me to have passed. \u2014 William Fitz Nicholas of Brug quits to Humbert Prior of Wen lock ad right in that third part of a virgate in Laverden which Walter Wigot formerly held. Wdliam Fitz Nicholas, holding this land of the Priory, had an Under-Tenant, viz., William son of Thomas de Laverden, whose tenure was in fee and for homage, and 2s. 8c?. rent. Him the said Wdliam Fitz Nicholas attorns to the Priory : in short, the Grantor in this Deed merely quits his mediate interest between the Prior and William son of Thomas.24 Again, Philip de Gasam, for one merk, quits to Wenlock Priory ad right in the third part of a virgate in Laverden, which vir gate Walter Wigot sometime held. The quittance is of homages, reliefs &c.25 \u2014 \u25a0 I suppose this Deed to relate to another share of the same virgate with the last, and that the Prior thus bought up the interests of two of Walter Wigot's coheirs, the third coheir being Laurence Fitz Laurence above mentioned.

Hamond de Laverden, late Tenant of Higher Laverden, was de- ceased. His Son William, a Minor, in custody of his Mother, was to be the Prior's Tenant. His future obligations would be to do suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament, and to pay a rent of 10s. per annum. This Tenement had done suit to Munslow Hundred till the reign of Richard I. Hugh de Laverden was the cotemporary Lord of Lower Laverden. His rent and conditions of tenure were in every respect the same with those of Wdliam. So had his vill formerly owed suit to Muns low Hundred. 26 On July 7, 1259, we have Adam de Laverden and his wife taking out a writ of mort d'ancestre against John Cusyn of Laverden, concerning a messuage and land in Laverden. Their fine for this writ was 6s. 8c?.27 At the Assizes of September 1272, Richard son of Thomas Fitz Bernard sued Richard Fitz Bernard (his Uncle, I presume), under writ of mort d'ancestre, for one virgate in Lake and half a virgate in Laverden. The Defendant said that Adam Fitz Thomas and Alice Stirch were Tenants of two parts of the half- virgate in Laver den ; moreover, he denied altogether that the Plaintiff was Thomas Fitz Bernard's heir. The Jury further found that Agnes, widow of Thomas Fitz Bernard, was Tenant of the remaining third of the half- virgate in Laverden : \u2014 so the Defendant was dismissed sine die?8 About this time we find mention of Alan de Laverden (successor, I think, to Hugh) ; of Master William de Laverden, of Richard Smalemon of Laverden, and of Henry le Hethene of Laverden. The latter also occurs at later periods of the Century, viz., as a Juror of Wenlock Liberty at the Assizes of 1292, and on a local Inquest in May 1296, besides as a witness of some undated Deeds. Meantime, William son of Hamo de Laverden, though a Minor in 1255, had attained full age. As William de Lavergrene he is entered among the Jurors of the Liberty at the Assizes of 1272, and as Widiam de Lardegrene occupied a similar position on the Inquest of November 1274.

Thus, under Laverden we have Edward More paying a chief-rent of 17s. 4c?., and Laurence Ludlow paying 4s. 10c?. aud 4s. for two tenements, the last of which is the Morehous. Under Shypton we have only one rent, viz., 2s. 4c?. receivable from John Peramor; and under Kylmescote only one, viz., 13s. 4c?. receivable from Thomas Laken.30 The Valuations of 1534-5 and 1541-2, already given under Ship ton, probably included the rents of these adjuncts. MOORE HOUSE. This was undoubtedly an appurtenance of the Domesday Manor of Shipton. I have already mentioned one member of that family of More, which seems to have held here under the Priory of Wen lock, and to have taken a name from the place.

It is an agreement between Brother Henry Prior of Wenlock and his Convent on the one part, and Richard son of Henry of the Morehus on the other. Richard covenants that he and his Heirs shall pay to the Prior a third part of the goods of every Tenant dying in his (Richard's) tenements of Merhus and Larden.

I will not say that this tenement, consisting of a virgate, was part of the Domesday Manor of Shipton.32 It is because it is now in Shipton Parish that I prefer to treat of it here, and not indeed knowing of any other Manor with which I can more reasonably con nect it. It was at all recorded periods held in fee under the Prior of Wenlock. In 1221, William de Kelmescott is named as Surety in a Law suit concerning land in Wenlock. About 1240 and 1260, we find mention of Richard de Kylmes cote; but he, I think, was only an Under- Tenant in Lutwyche. Cotemporary with him was Roger de Kilmescott, the Prior's Feoffee here. At the Inquest of 1255, this Roger was returned as Lord of Kilmescot in Wenlock Liberty. He held it of the Prior, paying a rent of 13s. 4c?. per annum (the very sum paid by Thomas Laken 250 years later) . He did Suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament , as his Ancestors till Richard I's time had done to Munslow Hundred.33 Soon afterwards, Roger de Kylmescote precedes the Lord of Lut wyche in the testing clause of a deed ; and he officiated as a Juror for Wenlock Liberty at the Assizes of 1272 and the Inquisition of 1274. The following Deed, though undated, seems to me to have passed in the reign of Henry VI.

I have already alluded to the termination worth, or worthing, as being sometimes taken to denote a village.1 If so, the change from wort/tin to ton (a town) is slight, as far as meaning is concerned. Tichel, or Tihel, was a Saxon name stid known in Shropshire in the twelfth century, as I shall hereafter show under Leighton. The Tihel, who gave name to the Manor now under notice, will have'belonged to a very remote \u00e6ra. Domesday notices the said Manor thus\": \" The same Church (St. Milburg's) holds Tichelevorde, and held it in time of King Edward. Here are vn hides geldable, and in other hides quit of geld. In demesne is i ox-team, and there are vi Villains and vi Boors and i Radman, with v teams, and still there might be vi teams (more, employed) here. Here are in Serfs, and a Wood (sufficient) for fattening lx swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 100s. (per annum). Now it is worth 50s.\" 2 Though Tichelevorde, alias Ticheleworthin, be, as far as the name is concerned, represented by the present township of Ticklerton, yet the Caput of the Domesday Manor was at a very early period transferred elsewhere. Whilst therefore I am treating of the Manor generady, it will be much more to my purpose if I entitle it the Manor of \u2014 Caton=untret^^Vuooti,3 Which vill was originally a member only of Tichelevorde. The Manor was held chiefly in demesne by Wenlock Priory; and I meet with no earlier Record of its general status than is detailed in the Inquest of 1255, when the Jurors of Wenlock Liberty returned \" Eton with its appurtenances as the Manor of the Lord Prior.\" 1 Vol. I, p. 137, note 2. 2 Domesday, so. 252, b, 1. of Longefeld\" (Longville), sometimes \" Eaton Priors.\" 3 Sometimes called \"Eaton in the Vale"], [360, "312 EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD. These appurtenances they stated to be Herton (now Harton), Ty cleworthin (Ticklerton) , Longefewd (Longvide), and Lussekote (Lushcote), which, with Wolverton, made up a Manor of eight and-a-half hides.4 Add to these Hatton, a vill then reckoned to contain one and-a-half hides, and originally a member of this Manor, and we have the aggregate ten hides of Domesday. Of these members I shall speak hereafter in detail, but shad at present treat only of the paramount interests of the Prior of Wenlock. At the Assizes of 1256, the Prior of Wenlock, Roger Fitz Thomas, and others, were found to have levelled a stank in Eton, to the injury of Richard deck's free tenement. The stank was ordered to be restored.5 In 1291, the Prior derived from one carucate of land at Eton 6s. 8c?. per annum; from eight acres of meadow, 16s.; from assized rent, and two Mills, \u00a35.; from tallage, \u00a35.; from Perquisites of the Manor-Court and labour dues, \u00a31. 6s. 8c?.

The Parish of Eaton is not conterminate with what we have sup posed to constitute the Domesday Manor, but somewhat more ex tensive. The parallel between Eaton-under-Heywood and the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, as parishes, should be kept in mind. Each was a large constituent of the far greater spiritual Fief of St. Mdburg. As Wenlock Parish included Willey, Oxenbold, Broseley, and other places which were not originally of the temporal fee of St. Milburg, so did Eaton parish include Upper Millichope and, with it, Hunger ford, which were acqufred by the Priory after Domesday. In the latter cases it would almost seem that the spiritual jurisdiction was allowed as a result of the temporal acquisition. If so, the bound aries of Parishes must actually have been altered to satisfy this ex traordinary prescriptive right. The earliest notices which I have of Eaton Church have already been set forth under Wenlock Church.11 The two Rectories were cotemporaneously appropriated to the Priory by Bishop Widiam 10 Monasticon, V, pp. 79, 81. 11 Supra, p. 265. - Monasticon, V, 78. 8 Register at Willey, so. 35, b. 9 Register at WiUey, so. 38, b. 40 III."], [362, "314 EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD. de Vere (1186-1199), which appropriations were confirmed by Bishop Giles de Braose as before stated. But in the time of Bishop Hugh Foliot (1219-1234) the Prior's rights as regards Eaton were disputed. A Charter of that Prelate informs us how \" the Prior appeared before the Chapter of Hereford, renouncing his right to the Church of Eaton, and committed himself to the Bishop's grace, asking for mercy and not judgment.\" The Bishop proceeds to concede the said Church to the Priory, but specially devotes it to the better provision of the Monks' Kitchen (in augmentum Co quin\u00e6), and saving the due maintenance of a Vicar there.12 On April 29, 1290, Etone was visited by Bishop Swinfield, and the Prior of Wenlock gave forage for thirty-six horses which were of the Prelate's train.13 The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Etone as belonging to the Prior of Wenlock, but set apart (deputata) for the Pittance of the Monks, its value being \u00a310. per annum. The Vicarage was at the same time worth \u00a34. 6s. 8c?.14 On May 23, 1331, Bishop Thomas de Cherlton, visiting Much Wenlock, saw the Prior's \" Titles for the Church of Eton with the Chapel of Millingchop,\" and pronounced them sound.15 In 1341 the Parish of \"Eton-Priors\" was assessed to the Ninth at \u00a36. 8s. 4c?., not at \u00a310. (the Church Taxation), because the corn had suffered from tempests, there had been a general murrain among sheep ; also the smad-tithes, offerings, and glebe-land were computed in the Taxation, and could not be reckoned in the ninth ; lastly, the land of eight tenants lay unfilled, having been surren dered.16 The Kitchen Rent-Roll of Wenlock Priory, taken in 1495-6, gives ample evidence that Bishop Foliot's appropriation of the Rectorial tithes of Eaton Church had been maintained. The tithes of Eyton (perhaps Eaton) \u00a37. 15s. 4d., of Eton (per haps Hatton) \u00a33. 3s. 8c?., of Millichope and Hungerford \u00a31 . 10s., of Wad-uuder-Heywood(probablyEastwall)8s.,ofLongville\u00a31.3s.4rf., and of Lushcote 14s., were ad receivable by the Kitchen, and make a Total of \u00a314. 14s. 4d.17 In 1534-5 the Rectorial or Corn Tithes of Eton were returned 12 Patent, 22 Edw.

On the iter of Alan de Nevill in 1167, a fine of one merk was laid upon Hatton,21 which I take to be this place. At the County Assizes of October 1203, one Richard de Hatton is found essoigning himself for non-attendance. His Essoignor was Henry de Ticlewrthin, which inclines me to think he was of this place. During the time of Joybert Prior of Wenlock, that is, between the years 1204 and 1215, one William de Hereford, being Badiff of the said Prior, demised a hide in Hatton to Robert de Hatton. This probably was the first feoffment given by Wenlock Priory within its Manor of Eaton. The Feoffee was afterwards impleaded in respect of the services reserved to the Prior, not on the ground of the said Bailiff's incompetency to grant. This dispute was in Easter Term 1227, the Plaintiff being Prior Imbert. Robert de Hatton demanded View of the premises, and the case was adjourned till the Quinzaine of the Holy Trinity.22 At the same time there 21 Rot. Pip. 13 Hen.

Of him I will speak presently. Prior Imbert's dispute with Robert de Hatton, after being in abeyance for ten years, was settled, by Final Concord, at Salop, on May 3, 1237.23 The Fine purports to be between Imbert Prior of Wenlock, complainant, and Robert de Hatton, deforciant, \u2014 of cus toms and services which the Prior required from the same Robert, for a hide-and-half in Hatton. The Prior's demands were, that Robert should pay him 20s. per annum for the said land, and should do suit to the Prior's Hundred Court of Burton, and should provide ten men for one day in Autumn, to carry the Prior's Hay, at the said men's own cost ; also that Robert and his Tenants of Hatton should do suit to the Prior's Halimot of Eton three or four times a year, which customs Robert did not recognize. Moreover the Fine was to extend to a question of boundary to be drawn between Robert's land of Hatton and the Prior's lands at Thikel wrthin and Horton, the Prior adeging that Robert had attracted five acres to his fee. \u2014 On all these points there was a recognition of Grand Assize between the parties, and the Fine was that Robert de Hatton and his heirs should pay the Prior 25s. annually, on February 23, at Wenlock, and should do suit at the Prior's Hundred Court of Burton, by afforciament of Hundred Court, to wit, when a robber was there to be tried, or judgment to be given, in pursuance of any Writ Royal. Moreover all the land eastward of a stated bound ary,24 fixed by twelve Knights, was to remain to the Prior, all to the westward to Robert de Hatton. For this Fine and agreement the Prior remitted all other customs and services. Very consistently with the above, the Inquisition of Wenlock Liberty, in 1255, states that \"Robert de Hatton is Lord of the Vill of Hatton, and he holds of the Prior of Wenlock, and pays the Prior 25s. per annum, and does suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament, and his antecessors used to do suit to Munslow till Richard I's time, and Hatton is a hide and a half.\" 25 23 Pedes Finium, 21 Hen.

A Fine levied at Salop, Feb. 3, 1256, perhaps relates to this place. \u2014 Margery de Hetton is plaintiff, and Robert de Hetton de forciant, \u2014 of a messuage and fifteen acres in Hetton, whereof was Plea of Convention. Robert concedes that he can give or alienate nothing of the premises, so as that they shall not revert to Margery after his death, \u2014 to hold to Margery and her heirs, of the heirs of Robert, at lc?. rent. Margery gave for this concession a sore sparrow-hawk?6 Hatton came afterwards to be held by the Lords of Harley, under Wenlock Priory, at the old rent; 27 but I can say nothing further of its earlier history, except in connection with certain persons whom I take to have held here under the Hattous. \u2014 On January 14, 1222, at Warwick, Johanna widow of William Fitz Baldwin, sued Geoffrey Fitz Baldwin (probably her husband's Brother and Heir) for dower. She was non-suited.28 When the Prior of Wenlock and Robert de Hatton were at issue, in 1227, Geoffrey Fitz Baldwin came into Court, and said that he held two carucates in Hatton, and took part with the Prior in his claim rather than with Robert de Hatton in his defence.29 He seems however to have misapprehended the Prior's object, for the latter forthwith stated that \" his claim was only for services.\" March 12, 1227, one Walter Fitz Baldwin was a witness in the Prior's Court at Burton. Ticklerton and Harton. \u2014 Of these two members of the Manor of Eaton I can give no early account further than has already been implied. They seem to have been held by Copyholders at variable rents. In 1495-6, 18s. rent of the Vill of Tyclardyn, and 4s. 4d. rent of Tyclardyn Mill, were devoted to the Kitchen of the Priory. In 1521-2, a Rental of Tyclewardyne gives a list of eight Tenants paying in all \u00a34. 14s. 0\\d. per annum, whilst five Tenants in Her ton paid \u00a33. 17s. 4K30 Wollerton was originally another member of the Manor of Eaton; but here the Prior had a Tenant in Fee. 26 Pedes Finium, 40 Hen.

The other part of Eastwall is in Rushbury Parish. This parochial division exactly corresponds with an ancient manorial distinction ; for while Long ville, Lushcote, and part of Eastwall belonged to the Prior's Fee of Eaton, the other part of Eastwad was a member of De Lacy's Fee of Rushbury. I find one Wdliam de Longavill attesting a Charter of Joybert Prior of Wenlock between 1194 and 1215. The Tenants here seem however to have been Copyholders. The Fine-Rod of 15 Edw.

At the her of Geoffrey de Lang ley in 1250, the Prior was found to have erected houses on this exclusive territory, and that without license. His Houses were ordered to be thrown down; but the Prior, before Michaelmas 1250, proffered to the King \u00a3100. for \" having his houses and for assarts.\" * Hence the King's Charter, dated Nov. 4, 1251, which grants, inter alia, that, for \u00a3100. now paid, the Prior and Convent may have the said houses in peace, although within bounds of the Forest; and Geoffrey de Langley and John Fitz Hugh (Forester of the County) are ordered accordingly.5 In 1255, the Vill of Maddeleg is merely noticed as being in the 1 Vol. II, 124, note 67. 5 Rot.

In January 1271, John Sprowe had a writ of mort d'ancestre against the Prior of Wenlock for a carucate in Madeley.8 In Nov. 1274, Lovekin the Fisher of Caldebrook was one of the inhabitants of Wenlock Liberty who had suffered from the extortion and injustice of the Officers of Robert Trillek.9 On Nov. 8, 1283, King Edward I, being informed that it would not be to the detriment of his Forest of Mount Gilbert if the Prior and Convent of Wenlock should enclose their Wood of Madeley (though within limits of the Forest) with a ditch and fence (haia) and should make a Park there, allows them so to do.10 The Valuation of the Prior's temporalities in 1291 gives the Income from Madeley at \u00a313., viz., five carucates of land, \u00a34. 10s.; six acres of meadow, 10s.; Assized Rents and Mid, \u00a35. ; Tallage, \u00a32. ; Perquisites and dues in labour, \u00a3l.n There is no appearance of the Priors of Wenlock having granted any feoffment in Madeley down to the time at which the Fine Roll, already quoted, tells us something of the then state of tenure in ad the Wenlock Manors.

I shall give, under Stoke St. Milburg, the history of this Church, from its taxation at twelve merks in 1291, to the license, granted June 21, 1342, for its appropriation to Wenlock Priory. Mean whde, that is, in 1341, the Parish had been assessed only \u00a32. 16s. to the Ninth. \u2014 Great storms, want of sheep-stock, and the sur renders of six Tenants, were the chief causes of the low assessment. Also the small tithes, offerings, and glebe, valued in the greater taxation, were not reckoned in the Ninth.18 John Aaron, late Rector of Madeley, resigned his preferment very shortly after the appropriation, viz., on November 29, 1343; he also executed a formal deed of resignation, in the Prior's Had at Wenlock, on 17th January, 1344. On March 12, 1343 (i. e., 1344 n. s.), the Prior in fud Chapter appoints Widiam de Swynoie, Rector of Little Wenlock, his Proctor, to obtain his induction to the vacant Rectory of Madeley. \u2014 The See of Hereford was vacant, but on March 19, the Com missary of the Vicar of the Archbishop of Canterbury gives mandate to Wdliam de Eyton, perpetual Vicar of the Holy Trinity of Wen lock, to induct either the Prior or his Proctor into corporal pos session of Madelei Church.19 On March 21, 1344, a Certificate by a Notary Public deposes to the induction of the Prior's Proctor by the above-named William de Eyton, on the day stated, and in presence of John Aaron, (now) Rector of Broseley Chapel, Sir John de Stirehley, Parochial Chap lain of Madeley, and Sir Roger de Kemberton, Chaplain of the Blessed Mary in the same Church. Already, viz., on March 10, 1344, had Guychard, Prior of Wen lock, appointed Sir John de Brugg perpetual Vicar of Madeley.

The Domesday notice of this Manor may be distinguished from that of Much Wenlock by the comparative smallness of extent.

In demesne is i ox-team and im Villains, and there are n Boors with in teams.

Now it is worth 40s.\" x This notice aptly illustrates the close proximity of Little Wenlock to the great Forest of Mount Gilbert; and when, in 1180, the Prior of Wenlock was assessed in the large sum of 40s. for his codective wastes and purprestures, the entry on the Forest Roll stands be tween Leighton and Dawley, indicating, I think, that Little Wen lock was the principal locality of these encroachments. Moreover, Richard Clerk of Parva Wenlock is assessed 2s. on the same occa sion, apparently for building a workshop.2 In 1255, the Jurors of Wenlock Liberty said that the Vill of Little Wenlock, with its appurtenances, was a Manor of the Prior of Wenlock, and that it contained three hides.3 At the Assizes of August 1267, Henry, the Provost of Welling ton, and others, were found to have disseized the Prior of six acres in Little Wenlock.* 25 Pat. 20 Edw.

It is well to observe the irregular boundary which is given to Hereford Diocese, from its including the Parishes of Badger, Beck bury, Madeley, and Little Wenlock. The River Severn in this quarter seems to suggest a much more natural limit. The anomaly evidently resulted from the ancient boundary of St. Mdburg's lands having been adopted as that of the Diocese. Now, the See of Hereford was not founded tid the year 676, the very period on which we have fixed as the \u00e6ra of St. Milburg. If her influence and sanctity were such as to determine the boundary of a Diocese, and we have before our eyes strong evidence that it was so, then the other traditions about St. Milburg become propor tionably strengthened, and the Antiquary learns with delight that certain legendary truths are not invaddated by the lapse of a thou sand years. The Parish of Little Wenlock was conterminate with the Manor, including the hamlets of Huntington and Coalmoor. The Priors of Wenlock never obtained any appropriation of the Church, which is therefore a Rectory to this day. Its annual value iu 1291 was taxed at \u00a34. 6s. 8c?.12 The Prior's pension is not men tioned in the said Taxation, but the Bishop of Hereford's Confirma tion of 1331 ratifies the pension, though it does not specify its amount. In the Inquisition of 1341, the Church of Little Wenlok is called a Chapel. Its Taxation, of \u00a34. 6s. 8c?. was reduced to \u00a31.12s. in assessing the ninth on the Parish. Destruction of crops by weather, absence of sheep-stock, non-cultivation of land, were the reasons. The small tithes, offerings, and glebe, were also to be adowed for in the current estimate.13 In 1379, this Church is said to be of the Prior's donation, and valued at \u00a35.u There was aComposition or award, made apparently in the fifteenth Century by the Prior, between the Rector and Parishioners of Little 10 Three classes of Tenants are enume rated, viz., Tenants at Will, Copyholders, and Tenants by Indenture. 12 Pope Nich.

The latter, holding tenements or cottages there, were to pay annually charity-pence (denarios caritatis), and bread for each tenement, according to local custom. Also every Communicant should pay \\d. on each day of Oblation.15 In 1534-5, the preferment of John Powes, Rector of Little Wen lock, is put at \u00a311. 10s. for glebe and tithes. His charges were, Procurations and Synodals, 2s. 2e?., and the Prior of Wenlock's pen sion of \u00a31.16 The latter seems indeed to have been a constant and invariable condition of presentation. EARLY RECTORS. Peter de Langon, a Burgundian, is the first Rector of whom I find mention. He was also Prebendary of Preston, in the Cathe dral Church of Hereford. In both preferments his Patron was Peter de Aquablanca, his fellow-countryman, and then Bishop of Hereford ; but we have no account of the mode in which a presenta tion to Little Wenlock devolved in this instance to the Diocesan. Aquablanca died Nov. 27, 1268, and John le Breton, his Successor (consecrated June 2, 1269), deprived Langon of both his prefer ments. Langon instituted proceedings in the Papal Court against his Diocesan, \u2014 proceedings which, in course of time, implicated Bishop Cantilupe, the Successor of Le Breton, and Bishop Swinfield, the Executor and Successor of Cantilupe.17 Meanwhde I find that \u2014 John de Kemeseye, Acolyte, had custody given him of this Church on June 25, 1276, till Michaelmas following,18 Bishop Can tdupe's Official being ordered to induct him. Robert de Wych was incumbent here when, on July 26, 1290, sentence was given in the Pope's Palace at Orvieto for the restora tion of Langon to all his preferments. Wych was moreover ordered facts I shall often, and thankfully, ap propriate. (Bonsehold Roll of Bishop Swinfield, with Abstract and Illustrations, edited, for the Camden Society, by the Rev.

Its present value is 6s. per annum.\"1 This name is now lost, and the situation of the place can only be surmised. Domesday mentions it between Shipton and Burton, while a Deed of the twelfth Century grants an assart in Purteleia in conjunction with another assart in Bradeley. These facts would induce me to look for Petelie in the district which lies South and South-East of Patton and Bradley ; and this 19 Blakeway's Extracts from Hereford I Registers. 1 \u2022 Domesday, so. 252, b, 1."], [377, "329 DITTON PRIORS. very district, as it has been the scene of all manner of changes, so must I treat of it hereafter with all manner of conjectures. Petelie has doubtless been absorbed into some greater Manor, held by the Prior of Wenlock at Domesday, or acquired by him afterwards. A comparison of hidages wdl hardly facilitate our search, for the conventional hidage of the greater Manors of Saint Milburg was not affected by small additions of territory. The situation of Petelie is one of those questions which I must leave to future discovery or conjecture. Meanwhile, to facilitate such discovery and narrow the area of such conjecture, we proceed with the history of places better known and more clearly identified. Bttton .pviors* This Manor is one of those which, being held in demesne by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, was perhaps exempt from all external jurisdiction at the time of Domesday. Its Hundred therefore is not specified in that Record, but its position attaches it to Patintune rather than to any other Hundred ; and Ruthad, which was in the same parish, is identified in Domesday as a Patintune Manor. The older name of Ditton was Dudinton, itself a contraction of the still more ancient form, Dubbing-tun, i. e., the town of Dud ding, or of the Sons of Dudda. Domesday thus notices the Manor : 1 \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Dodintone. Earl Eduin held it (in Saxon times) with mi berewichs. Here are xn hides geldable. In de mesne are v ox-teams and x Serfs, and (there are) xx Villains and viii Boors with vi teams; and there might be other xm teams here. In Wich there is one salt-pit returning 2s. In time of King Edward (the Manor) paid \u00a310. (per annum). Now it pays \u00a311.\" I have before noticed and explained the circumstance of Salin\u00e6 having been attached to a Shropshire Manor of Earl Edwin.2 The other important feature in the Domesday notice of Ditton is the attachment of four berewichs to the Manor. Two of these I take to have been afterwards represented by the townships of Ash field and Middleton-Priors ; whdst Sidnall, Derrington, Great and 1 Domesday, so. 253, b. 2. | 2 Vol. II, 174, note 1. in. 42"], [378, "330 DITTON PRIORS. Little Hudwich, and Powkesmore, or some two of them, should constitute the remainder. Ditton passed as a whole from the Norman Earls to the Crown, and came to the hands of Henry II at his accession, unshorn of any of its members, except perhaps Ashfield, which seems to me to have been granted in Serjeantry by Henry I. Ditton was one of three great Manors with which Henry II, soon after his accession, rewarded the services of one of his foreign partizans. There is a Charter of \" Henry Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and Earl of Anjou,\" to the Cistercian Abbey of Radmore,3 which will be found on examination to contain some valuable significancies for any general Historian who may be engaged with the period at which that Charter passed. Suffice it here to say, that it belongs to the year 1153, when the Duke was in England struggling for his Crown, that it passed at Coventry, which City may well have been visited by the Duke during his summer campaign in the midland Counties, and that it is tested (inter alios) by one whose name is given as \" Hugh de Pirie.\" Hugh de Periers, or Pirariis, was of Periers-sur-Andede, in Nor mandy. King Henry, within the first year of his reign, gave him the Shropshire Manors of Corfham, Culmington, and Ditton, whose collective fiscal value was \u00a342. per annum. By so much, from and after Michaelmas 1155, was the King's Ferm of the County reduced, seeing that they were all Manors of ancient demesne, and the Sheriff accountable for their issues.4 This interest of Hugh de Periers ceased about Christmas 1175, for the Sheriff, accounting at Michael mas 1176, awards to the name of Hugh de Periers, only \u00a310. 10s. for a quarter of the fiscal year then expired. As to Corfham and Culmington, they had for the remaining three-quarters of the year been in the King's hand, or rather in the ferm of the Sheriff. Dodinton had however passed at once from the tenure of Hugh de Periers to that of the Monks of Wenlock. Its fiscal value, as dis tinct from the other two manors, was \u00a311., and so the Sheriff, at Michaelmas 1176, assigns to the said Monks \u00a38. 5s. in Dodinton 3 Monasticon, V, 447, Num. iv.

I must now give particulars, borrowed from far different sources, as to the mode in which Ditton became Ditton Priors, that is, how it passed from the Feoffee of the Crown to the Prior of Wenlock. Hugh de Periers then (if I understand my authorities rightly) , about the end of the year 1175, feeling his end approaching, sur rendered himself, according to the custom of his time, to the Monks of Wenlock ; \u2014 that is, he wished to die a member of their fraternity, and to be buried within their walls. He gave them on this account his Manor of Ditton, or rather the reversion thereof, after the de cease of Alice de Cheney his wife. He gave it, specially reserving the tenant-rights of his men ; \u2014 that is, they, whom he had enfeoffed there, were to hold under the Priory by the same conditions as had previously been stipulated with himself. But a deed of such interest and antiquity should speak for itself:6 \u2014 \" In nomine Sanct\u00e6 Trinitatis. \u2014 Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Hugo de Piris pro salute domini mei Regis Henrici et pro salute anim\u00e6 me\u00e6 dedi et concessi Deo et Sanct\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 et Sanct\u00e6 Milburg\u00e6, cui meipsum reddidi, et monachis de Wenloc, in liberam puram et perpetuam elemosynam, manerium de Dudintuna post de cessum uxoris me\u00e6, Alizi\u00e6 de Clemez, cum omnibus pertinentiis suis in bosco et piano et pratis et pascuis et aquis, ita libere sicut do minus meus, Rex Henricus, mihi pro servicio meo idem manerium in hereditatem dedit; salvo jure et hereditate hominum meorum scilicet, Achillis, Walengerii, Alberici fratris sui, et Adam\u00e6 Pin cern\u00e6, ut ipsi et heredes eo servicio teneant de monachis, quo de me tenuerunt et sicut carta mea eis testatur.

Accordingly this Writ virtuady transferred the Manor of Ditton at once to the Monks, without so much as mentioning any lien or immediate interest of Hugh de Periers' Widow. The Monks also went to Henry II for a Charter confirmatory of Hugh de Periers' bequest. That too they obtained, when the King was at Bridgnorth, \u2014 and in 1175 or 1176, as I have before supposed.7 This Royal Charter mentions and confirms the act of Hugh de Piris as a testamentary one. It further stipulates for the life-interest of Aelicia de Caineto, \" who was his wife,\" and whose dower Dudin ton is said to have been. It reserves to the King a right of redemp tion, that is, if he or his heirs should ever wish to resume the Manor, and should assign the Monks an equivalent revenue (\u00a311.), in Churches or other things.8 What wras the precise composition between the Monks and Adce de Cheney I cannot learn. It seems to have endured for less than five years, and then to have been altered, not, I imagine, to the ad vantage of the Priory. The Lady had in fact remarried to Geoffrey de Say, and he, I have little doubt, reseized the Manor of Ditton, that he might more effectually negotiate with the Monks. A very extraordinary coincidence between two distinct documents leads to this idea. \u2014 At the Forest- Assize of 1180, the Justices laid a fine of two merks on Geoffrey de Say and the Prior, for waste in Hudwic, and of one merk on Geoffrey de Say for waste in Dodinton.9 In the very same year, \"Geoffrey de Say, with consent of Adelisa de Chemey\" his wife, delivers to the Prior his Manor of Dudintun, which was Adelisa's dower on the part of Hugh de Piris. He gives it for a sum of 160 merks paid down, which is to cover all his claim for eight years to come, and for an annuity of \u00a314. payable to his wife after the said eight years should have expired. \" Vol. I, pp. 263, 264. \u00bb Forest Rolls, Salop, No. I. 8 Monasticon, V, 73, Notes, No. 3. |"], [381, "DITTON PRIORS. 333 This deed, which is dated in 1180, evidently passed in Normandy,10 for, except \" Roger Porter of Wenlock,\" the witnesses do not seem to be connected with Shropshire. Henry II, who was in France from Easter 1180 to July 1181, confirmed the last agreement. The Royal Charter is dated at Ivrey (i. e., Ibreium, on the South-Eastern Frontier of Normandy) .u Removing a scribal error from a return of the year 1211, we learn accurately enough that the Prior of Wenlock holds the Manor of Dudinton by gift of Hugh de Periers (de dono de Ferrar) and con cession of Henry II, and that the same Hugh gave it with his body to the House of Wenlock in almoign. And it used to render \u00a311. (to the Exchequer) ,12 Again, the \" Verdict of the Liberty of Wenlock,\" in 1255, states the Prior to be Lord of the Manor of Dodinton, and that it was once a King's Manor ; that King Henry gave it to Hugh de Peres, and he gave it to the Prior ; lastly, that it contained twelve hides.13 On Feb. 6, 126.2, Aymo Prior of Wenlock obtained King Henry Ill's confirmation of this Manor to his House.14 The Verdict of the Manor of Corfham in the year 1274 embodied an entry (now mutilated) which related to Ditton. Thus much we obtain from the Record, viz., that Doditon was still remembered to have been sometime associated with Corfham, and to have been a Manor of Hugh de Periers, and that the change of tenure had taken place in the reign of Henry II.15 In 1291, the Valuation of the annual proceeds of this Manor was given under the Temporalities of Wenlock Priory as follows : \u2014 Two carucates of land, \u00a31. 12s. ; Meadow (four-and-a-half acres), 10 This remark induces a further state ment, extracted from the Rotuli Norman ni\u0153. \u2014 In 1180 the Fermor of the Vicomtb of Arques acquits Geoffrey de Sai of 10*., chargeable on the land which he had with the wife of Hugh de Periers. In 1198, Geoffrey de Sai was himself Bailiff of Ar ques, and acquits himself of 10*., similarly chargeable ; and his wife seems to be still living. \u2014 was not far distant from Periers-sur- Andelle. 11 Monasticon, V, 73, Notes Nos. 1 & 2. 12 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. 13 Rot.

The Composition which about 1196 left the Advowson of this Church in possession of Wenlock Priory has been already set forth.22 On what the Dean of Brag's claim thereto rested, I am still at a loss to conjecture, for, though Earl Roger had originally given tithes at Corfham and Culmington to his Collegiate Foundation at Quatford, his Charter says nothing about Ditton. Perhaps, however, the con nection of the three Manors in other respects had something to do with the Dean's claim. I find no evidence that the payment which this Composition obliged the Prior to make annually to the Dean was perpetuated. The next notice which I have of this Church involves another anomaly. \u2014 Its Incumbent is called a Vicar, and yet the Church was not appropriated to Wenlock Priory tdl his death, at least twenty years afterwards. Widiam Bishop of Hereford (1186-1199) concedes to the Monks of Wenlock license to appropriate the Church of Dudentun after the decease of Master Nicholas de Hamtun, Vicar?3 Nicholas de Hamtun became Archdeacon of Salop (Hereford Diocese) ~* either before May 16, 1214, or else after July 1, 1219, and certainly died in that office before 1227. And between the years 1219 and 1226, Hugh Foliot, Bishop of Hereford, reciting the deed of his Predecessor William, concedes to Wenlock the appro priation of Dudenton Church \"after the death of the aforesaid Nicholas, then Archdeacon of Salop, and also, the said Archdeacon being actually dead, institutes \" the Priory.25 The first witness of this Deed is Simon Archdeacon of Salop, who was in office in 1227. John the Dean and the Chapter of Hereford recite and confirm these two Episcopal Charters by Deed dated Oct. 2, 1282.26 In 1291, the Church of Dodyton in Stottesden Deanery is said to be the Prior of Wenlock's, and valued at \u00a312., besides the Portion of the Vicar therein, which was \u00a34. 6s. 8c?.27 21 Monasticon, V, 80. 22 Supra, Vol.1, p. 322. sect.

Bishop Charlton's Confirmation of 1331 mentions the Church of Dodyton as rightly belonging to the Prior, and also approves of a portion receivable from the Chapel of Mittleton. In 1341, the Taxation of Dodyton Church is rightly quoted as twenty-four merks and a half (\u00a316. 6s. 8c?.), but the Assessors taxed the Parish to the Ninth, only at \u00a35. 4s. Storms, absence of sheep stock, and the surrender of nine impoverished Tenants, were the chief reasons for this reduction. Also, the greater taxation included glebe-land and other profits, not to be reckoned in estimating the Ninth?8 The Valuation of 1379 gives the Rectorial Income of Dodyton, deducting charges thereon, as \u00a38. 3s. 3d. ; and the Vicarage as worth \u00a33. 6s. 8c?. Both are probably understated. Nevertheless, in all subsequent statements till the Dissolution, I find the Prior's or Rectorial receipts to be limited to a charge of \u00a34. (perhaps a modus) on Ditton. The great tithes of Middleton Priors seem to have been partly allotted to the Vicar of Ditton, but at one time the Prior received a \" portion \" thereof valued at 26s., and later he received a pension of 10s. from the Vicar of Ditton as a charge thereon. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Vicarage of Ditton Priors, held by John Alen, as worth \u00a36. 13s. 4c?. in glebe and tithes ; but chargeable with the last-named pension of 10s., and with 7s. 8d. for procura tions and synodals.29 EARLY INCUMBENTS.30 Master Nicholas de Hamtun was Vicar, or Incumbent, here at the close of the twelfth Century. He died, as Archdeacon of Salop, before 1227. Thomas, Vicar of Ditton, occurs about 1329. John de Deryton, Vicar, on July 14, 1346, exchanges with \u2014 Hugh de Weston, late Vicar of Atyngham (Atcham) . Patron, the King ; \u2014 by reason of Wenlock Priory being in his hand. Hugh occurs as Vicar May 9, 1350. Sir Henry le Warde, Chaplain, was instituted Vicar here on Aug. 21, 1355, the King presenting as before. On Nov. 4, 1401, he exchanges with \u2014 Richard de Arderne, who resigned Thongland Chapel for this Vicarage. 28 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 190. 59 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 211, 216. | III. 30 From Blakeway's MSS. 43"], [386, "338 DITTON PRIORS. MIDDLETON PRIORS. Of this member of his Manor of Ditton it is clear that Hugh de Periers had given feoffment before the transfer to Wenlock Priory. There were four Vassals, whose rights were reserved by the said Hugh in his Charter of 1175. Which of them was Lord of Middleton must be matter of mere conjecture, but I am inclined to think that it was Adam Pincerna. At the For est- It er of 1 180, one William Fitz Adam and his Fellow were fined Is. 6c?. for an imbladement in Hudewic.31 In the next Century there were several Tenements in Middleton, probably subdivisions of an estate originally entire, but held by Feoffees between whom we can trace no relationship. On the other hand, we observe the Prior of Wenlock availing himself of every opportunity to buy up the fee-simple of any such parcel ; for, as I have before hinted, the system of this House was adverse to tenancies in-fee. The first instance of this which I shall offer is derived from a succession of Charters relating to a virgate in Middleton. \u2014 About the year 1200, Richard de Eston grants to Emma daughter of Ernald le Fleming a virgate in Mittdton , to wit, sixty acres, for three merks paid on entry ;\u2014 to hold in fee at an annual rent of 5s., payable to the Grantor and his heirs in even half-yearly portions on the feasts of St. Milburg (February 23) and of St. Mary Magdalen (July 22). Witnesses \u2014 Warin de Burwardel, Roger de Bagisoure, Robert de Girros, Adam de Beysin, William de Bardel, Walinger de Sidenal, William Clerk of Mittdton.32 \" After the lapse of half a Century or more, I find Engelard de Acton to be the representative of Richard de Eston, whilst Adam, son of the last witness in the above deed, had succeeded to the relative interest of Emma Fleming. Accordingly, Adam, son of William Clerk of Mitleton, sells and quit-claims to Richard Clerk, son of Alan, Rector of the Church of Borewarton, for fourteen merks (said to be paid down) 38 all his right in the same virgate ; \u2014 to hold to Richard and his heirs, of Engelard de Acton and his heirs, of whom the Vendor and his Father had held it, and by the same 31 Forest Rolls, Salop, No. I. 32 This Charter, as well as all others which I shall quote without further re ference under Middleton, is in possession of Robert Gardner, Esq., of Leighton. \u2014 The witnesses of this prove a date be- tween 1196 and 1220. 33 \" Pro quatuordecim marcis argenti quas mihi pacavit pr\u00e6 manibus.\" Pr\u0153 manibus is thus explained in the Glossaries. \u2014 Continub, \u2014 Sur le Champ."], [387, "MIDDLETON PRIORS. 339 services, viz., 5s. rent &c.

Witnesses : Sir Thomas de Costintin, William de Upton, Brice de Cleyburi, Roger Bonost of Borewarton, Henry de Bolde, and others. Engelard de Acton confirms the said Sale, in all particulars, ac cepting in fact the new Tenant at the old rent. \u2014 Witnesses: the same as the last, except Henry de Bolde, for whom we have \"William Fitz Symon of Mitleton.\" It is impossible to disconnect these three Deeds from a fourth, which I derive from a different source ;3i but I cannot reconcile the full payment of fourteen merks, so clearly stated above, with the fact that for 13 1 merks thereof, Richard son of Alan remained a Debtor. Adam Fitz Widiam, Clerk of Mittleton, grants to the Prior of Wenlock ad his right in a virgate at Mittleton, such right evidently consisting in a sum of \" 13^ merks, which Richard son of Alan, the Priest of Burewarton, owed the said Adam for the land.\" The Prior thus became entitled to a sum of \u00a39. (13| merks), receivable from Richard son of Alan, and, in default of payment, I suppose he would have a claim on the land itself. It further appears from the Deed that the Prior paid Adam Fitz Wdliam \u00a35. for this transfer, whilst the latter devoted the balance of \u00a34. to the works of Saint Milburg's Church, for the good of his soul.35 I believe that Richard son of Alan eventually paid his debt to the Prior, and so continued Tenant-in-fee of this virgate in Mid dleton. Under the name of Richard Clerk of Middleton, he attests a great number of Deeds, which concerned other lands here, and which passed in the last half of the thirteenth Century. His Son Roger occurs as a witness August 29, 1314, and as Lessor or Grantor of several small parcels in 1319, 1322, 1323, aud 1331. One of these leases, that of 1323, is to Alice, the Lessor's Sister, of four acres, to hold for her life, at 5c?. rent. On June 1 1, 1349, John, son of Roger le Clerk de Muttultun, is a Grantor of land in the Manor. Further than this I will not pursue the subject, except to say that the Prior of Wenlock seems sometime to have obtained Engelard de Acton's mesne interest in this virgate, and so to have become immediate Seigneur over the 34 Monasticon, V, p. 74, Notes, No. 6.

Hence, I doubt not, comes it to pass that among the Prior's Middleton rents in 1510-11 the only one of 5s. is charged on \"the Heir of William Clarke, for the Messuage called Hyggs.\"36 I now revert to other parts of this Manor, and an earlier period. At the County Assizes, November 1221, one Richard de Rothal, an extensive holder in Middleton, being dead, his Widow Alice, now remarried to Roger Fitz Tropinel, joined her said husband in suing the Prior of Wenlock, for dower in five virgates here, which she claimed in right of her first marriage. The Prior pleaded that the Plaintiffs had already, in full Court, at Wenlock, renounced their claim of dower, for 16s., which sum had been paid them ; and thereof he makes appeal to a Jury. The parties are however stated to have accorded by license of the Court.37 \u2014 Their Fine, dated Nov. 12, 1221, is preserved. It merely restates the plea in the usual form, exhibiting however Alice's claim as to a third of eight and a half virgates. This she and her husband forego, Prior Humbert giving them half a merk.38 At the same Assizes another estate, of half a hide, in Middleton, seems to have been litigated between Coparceners. \u2014 Emmeline, wife of Gerard the Anjovin, makes the said Gerard her Attorney in a suit oi mort d'ancestre, which Sibil and Dionisia, daughters of Alice, had against her. Elsewhere, on the same Rod, I find Gerard le Angevin giving half a merk for license to accord a suit of mort d'ancestre with Sibil aud Dionisia, called \" daughters of Cleibury.\" 39\u2014 Their Fine is preserved. \u2014 It is between Sibil de Cleiberie and Dionisia her Sister, Plaintiffs, and Gerard le Angovin and Emeline his wife, Tenants, of half a hide in Midelton, whereof was assize of mort d'ancestre. The Plaintiffs forego their claim in favour of Gerard and Emeline and the heirs of Emeline, for which they re ceive 3\\ merks.40 About this time one William de Middleton seems to have been Tenant for life of a virgate here, under the Prior of Wenlock. At his death, his Son, another William, supposing \u2022 probably that the tenure was in-fee, intruded on the premises for some time. Event ually he seems to have been brought to reason by process in the 36 Register, so. 37. A previous Rental (of 1495-6) gives a 5s. rent, chargeable on John Walter, in Mydddton.

Stephen acknowledging the Tenure, the Court ordered that the Prior should have his demand out of Stephen's lands.42 I will now give extracts from a series of Middleton Deeds, which seem to me to have passed between the years 1260 and 1314. They all relate to tenures in fee-simple ; and it is worth observing that, though the Prior of Wenlock was Lord of the Fee and Suzerain over all the parties, his interference is never once implied in these, his Tenants' mutual transactions. 1, Stephen Chamberlain of Mitleton gives to Agnes his daughter half a messuage and six acres in the fields of Mitleton ; \u2014 in fee ; \u2014 at 6c?. rent.

To conclude these extracts\u2014 William son of John Forester oc curs again in February 1331 ; and Margery, daughter of John le Wodeward by Christiana his wife, occurs in July 1345, and appa rently was not till then married. Another Record of this period shows Wenlock Priory as still intent on buying up any tenancy in Middleton. The Prior having a license to acquire two merks of land and rent, the King, by Patent, dated Oct. 10, 1342, allows that 19s. 8d. of such rent may be purchased from Hugh Sherere, in Mittelton juxta Dodyton?5 The further history of the Prior's interests here has been embo died in the general account of Ditton Priors. Middleton Priors Chapel. \u2014 Of this Chapel and its Incumbents I have said nearly all that can be said under Ditton or under Deux hill, with which latter, Middleton was combined. I should observe that \" Richard, Rector of the Chapel of Mittelton,\" who has been mentioned above,46 under date of March 28, 1343, was probably Richard de la More, at that time Incumbent of Deuxhid and Mid dleton Priors. \u2014 His Rectory I take to have been Deuxhid rather than Middle ton ; for, had the latter been a Rectory originally, and independent of any other Church, it is difficult to conceive how the Wenlock Monks can have worked out its total suppression without the fact being recorded. On the other hand, it is strange that Middleton, if only a Chapel, should be associated with Deuxhid, a distant Church, rather than with Ditton, which was near at hand, and whose Vicar seems at one time to have enjoyed the Tithes of Middleton, and to have been charged with a pension thereon. \u2014 All this mystery and anomaly serves probably to cover some scandalous piece of Monastic jobbing. The Chapel of Middleton Priors, though disused before the Dis solution, and not mentioned in the Valor of 1534-5, long survived its uses. Some remains thereof, adjoining a dwelling-house, are still, or were lately, in existence.47 SIDNALL.

Walinger was one of those Feoffees of Hugh de Periers whose rights were reserved when the latter bequeathed Ditton to Wenlock Priory. This Walinger was sometimes called De Sidnall ; some times he took a name from The Dykes, a locality of not unfrequent mention in early deeds of Ditton Manor. It is probable that he was Hugh de Periers' Executor. \u2014 At Michaelmas 1176, the Sheriff, among other arrears, owed the King a sum of \u00a319. 10s. This was part of the revenue chargeable for Corfham and Culmington, which should have been in the King's hand three parts of the fiscal year then ending. At Michaelmas 1177, the Sheriff renders account of this arrear, saying, that \" Wa renger ought to answer for the same,\" and then adding, that the whole had been paid by Warenger to four Jews, as a Writ of the King himself had enjoined.49 In the Forest-Roll of 1180, the name of Walinger is twice re peated among the assessments of this neighbourhood. He is charged 18c?. for an imbladement, viz., three acres sown with oats, and again 3s. 6d. for three acres of fine- wheat and one of oats, which are said to be in \" Dickes.\" In 1199, one Walinger had been Visor of repairs at Shrewsbury Castle; and on October 13 of the same year, Welinger Desdiches essoigned himself as Recognizor in a suit then pending at Westmin ster, and which seems to have related to lands at Clee St. Margaret.60 We have lately noticed the same person attesting a Middleton Deed of this very period under the more intelligible name of Wa linger de Sidenal. An association of ideas rather than of available facts leads me to notice the name of Walinger Fitz Hugh, who in 1221 was a land owner at Culmington, and also at Richard's Castle in Herefordshire. At this time there was also a Walinger de Sydenhal, perhaps the second of his name. I have already mentioned him as occurring in 1226.51 I have no distinct evidence about the succeeding Feoffees here. In August 1266, Widiam, son of Philip de Sydenhal, had arraigned a suit of mort d'ancestre against the Prior of Wenlock concerning six acres, and a suit of novel disseizin against Simon Baret and others concerning a tenement in Sydenhal.63 On March 15, 1301, the Inquest on the death of Roger de Bage- 49 Rot.

Thomas Lord of Sidnall has occurred to us before, attesting some undated deeds of this very period (1301), and still living in 1323. Hugh de Sidnall, perhaps brother of Thomas, had a son Wdliam, who occurs in 1346. Thomas also was succeeded by Widiam de Sidnall, Lord of Sidnall, who occurs from 1338 to 1349, in the deeds to which I have so often alluded. Sidnad probably remained a tenure in fee till the Dissolution, owing and acknowledging nothing to the Priory of Wenlock but 5s. corn-tithe, payable to the Convent Kitchen, and a chief-rent of 8s.,54 due to the Prior, as formerly Devisee of Hugh de Periers. Hudwich, Derington, Powkesmore. \u2014 Of these members of Dit ton I have said enough, as involved in the capital Manor. I do not understand them to have been held in fee at any time. A rent of Hudwich (6s. 8c?.) was in 1495-6 payable to the Convent Kitchen. The rents of \u00a31. 6s. 8c?. each, mentioned already55 as chargeable on Hudwich and Powkesmore in 1510-11, I take to have been settled by recent lease rather than by ancient feoffment. ASHFIELD. This Vill, originally a member of Ditton, became separated before the latter Manor passed to Hugh de Periers. The two were never again manorially united, though their parochial connection exists at this day. Ashfield, I think, must have been granted to the Ancestor of the Beysins at least as early as the time of Henry I. It was a member of their Serjeantry, and held by service of keeping the King's Hawks. The bulk of the lands thus held in capite by Beysin lay at Wrickton and Walkerslow, some distance from Ashfield. There we will resume the history of a famdy which, under Bd lingsley, Broseley, and Badger, has already engaged much of our attention. That which relates particularly to Ashfield shall be given here. \u2014 At the Forest- Assize of 1167, the Vills of Assefeld and Rohale 53 Inquisitions, 29 Edw.

The Plaintiff renounced his claim to Thomas and Margery and the heirs of Margery, receiving two-and-a-half merks.58 In 1246, Thomas de Baggesore was deceased, leaving his Widow Margery surviving. His eldest son Philip was his successor as Lord of Badger. His younger children (I suppose there were three) were probably under age at this period. In 1255, their Mother Margery had apparently been portioning Ashfield among them. The Munslow Inquisition of that year, in reply to a question as to the total or partial alienation of any Ser jeantry in the district, states as follows : \u2014 \" Adam de Beysin formerly held Eysfield, pertaining to his Ser jeantry which he holds (read ' held ') of the King, and he (Adam) gave the said vill in frank-marriage to Thomas de Baggesovere, with Margery his daughter, thirty years ago. Thereof, Richard de Bag gesovre holds one virgate by gift of the same Margery in the past year : Henry Mauveysin holds one-and-a-half virgates by gift of the same Margery three years ago : and Avice de Baggesovere holds half a virgate by gift of the same Margery in the past year.\" Another return of the same Jurors was nearly consistent, viz., that Richard de Beggesovre, Henry Mauvesin, and Amicia de Bag gesovre held the vill of Oysfeld for a hide of land, of Margery de Beysin, and they did no suit to County or Hundred, nor paid they stretward nor motfee, the Jurors knew not by what warrant.

He seems to have had other lands besides a share of Ashfield. The latter tenure does not ex plain his sitting as a Juror for Stottesden Hundred at the County Assizes of 1272, and at the Inquisitions of Nov. 1274. We have further had him purchasing two small parcels of land in Middleton Priors, but adjacent to Cleobury North rather than to Ashfield. The Munslow Inquisition of 1274 says of Esfeld, that its suit to the Sheriff's Tourn had been withdrawn by the King of Almagne when Lord of Castle Holgate.60 This I cannot account for, not knowing what seigneury the Lords of Holgate could possibly have at Ashfield. I suspect that the Jurors, if right as to the withdrawal, were mistaken as to its Author. The Feodary of 1284 assigns the whole of Ashfield to Richard de Baggesovre, who is said to hold \" Effeld \" of Walter de Beysin for one- sixth of a Knight's fee, whdst said Walter holds of the King in capite. At the Assizes of 1292, it appeared by presentment of the Muns low Jury, that Margery widow of Richard de Baggesovere was living, and that she had a part of Ashfield, viz., \" one virgate held of the Serjeantry, once Adam de Beysyn's.\" Margery was ordered to appear in Court, but I find no instant result of that summons.61 However, I cannot doubt that Margery's estate at Ashfield was for a time forfeited, as being a member of a Serjeantry and having been alienated without license. I find that King Edward I, in 1304, in trusted to Reginald de Rochehale one-and-a-half virgates and three acres in Asshefeld, \"which,\" says the Record, \" were once Margery de Baggesworth's, and were in the King's hand by reason of un licensed alienation.\" Reginald de Rochehale, thus ferming the pre mises, accounts to the Escheator citra Trent, between Michaelmas 1305 and Michaelmas 1306, for the current year's issues thereof.62 69 Rot. Bundred, II, 72, 70. The po sition of Ashfield, in Munslow Hundred, requires remark. The general rule is, that all places situated in the Domesday Hun dred of Patinton fell into Munslow or Stottesden Hundred, and remained there in 1255, \u2014 unless Wenlock Priory had ac quired an interest therein. 60 Rot.

It appears, from a totally different Record,83 that while Richard de Baggesore was living (that is, sometime between the years 1254 and 1292) he enfeoffed one Adam le King in a messuage and half virgate in Ashfield, being part of certain lands which he, Richard, held in capite by service of 2s. 10c?, rent. The Feoffee was to pay the same rent to his Feoffor as the latter paid to the Crown. On Richard de Boggesore's death, his son and heir, Eoger,64 assigned this rent of 2s. 10c?. as part of his Mother Margery's dower. Adam le King dying, his successor William le King appa rently paid the same rent to Reginald de Rochale for a time, and then to Margery, widow of the said Reginald, for her life. On July 6, 1319, William Kyng of Esshefeld being dead, his estate was seized by the Escheator as a Tenure in capite, and a Jury which sat at Brockton on Jan. 27, 1320, confirmed this view of the Tenure, saying that the messuage and half-virgate in ques tion were worth 18e?. per annum more than the rent of 2s. 10c?. re served to the Crown, and that Nicholas, son and heir of William Kyng, was aged twenty-four years on July 22, 1319. Hereupon Nicholas appeared in Chancery, affirming his Father's Tenure to have been under the Baggesores, and not in capite. After stating the feoffment of Adam le Kyng by Richard de Baggesore, he further deposed that Roger, son and heir of Richard de Bagge sore, made over the reserved rent of 2s. 10c?. to Reginald de Rochale, since deceased, and that Margery, Reginald's widow, also deceased, had continued to receive the said rent for her life from William le Kyng. In this statement it is clear that the alleged transfer of rent by Richard de Baggesore to Reginald de Rochale was a false hood. The latter had doubtless received the rent from the Kyngs, not as Grantee of Richard de Beggesore, but rather as Fermor of the Crown when Ashfield was an Escheat. However Edward II, by writ, dated March 14, 1320, set forth Nicholas Kyng's grievance, and ordered the Sheriff to make full in quiries, A Jury, which sat at Shrewsbury on Sept. 12, 1320, traced the right to the rent from Richard de Bagesore to Roger his son and heir, then as assigned by the latter to his Mother Margery. The Jurors did not allude to the temporary forfeiture any further than to deny that Richard de Baggesore had everma de any grant to Reginald de Rochale. This Inquest was taken in presence of 63 Inquisitions, 14 Edw. II, No. 20. 64 This Roger, son of Richard de Bag gesore, I have already distinguished from Roger de Baggesore, who died in 1300. \u2014 Both perhaps had lands at Cleobury North."], [398, "350 DITTON PRIORS. ASHFIELD. Roger de Baggesore and his Mother, both of whom the Sheriff served with a pr\u00e6munire, \u2014 that is, I suppose, with a caution lest they should trespass on the King's rights in receiving any fealty from a Tenant in capite. However, I think that Roger de Baggesore recovered his mesne rights in Ashfield. This I infer from a Lease,65 dated at Eshfeld, May 1, 1346, whereby Roger de Baggesore demises to Roger le Taillour a messuage and six acres of land in Eshfield, for thirty years. The land was bounded by lands of John le Kyng aud John de Berewyke, and the Lease is attested by the former. \u2014 The Lessor in this Deed, though perhaps not identical with Roger de Baggesore of 1320, was at least his Successor. He attests some Deeds at Cleobury North in 1346 and 1349. I now return, to give some account of that virgate-and-half in Ashfield which Margery de Beysin gave, in 1252, to Henry Mauveysin. He perhaps had married her daughter, but I can say nothing further of him. In 1292 the Munslow Jurors presented that Philip, son of Henry Mauveysin, was holding a virgate-and-half of Beysin's Serjeantry. The said Philip appeared in Court, and stated that he held the premises for life only, and under the Infant Heir of John, son of Thomas de Berewyk.66 I shad have to recur to this subject on a future occasion, and now proceed with the half virgate which Margery de Beysin had given in 1254 to Avice de Bagesore. This Avice was doubtless her daughter. In 1292, by presentment of the same Munslow Jurors, Thomas de la Cole appears as holding this half virgate, but how it descended to him from Avice I cannot say. At the same time, John de Esthope had 4s. rent in Ashfield, but how he acquired it does not appear. Certain however it is that all these alienations from Beysin's Serjeantry were questioned by the Crown, and sub jected the Tenants to prosecution, if not to forfeiture. An Escheator 's Roll, which belongs to one of the last years of Edward II (1320-7), shows that the King had then in hand a. mes suage and eight acres in Ashfield, which belonged to the estate of Peter Chese, deceased, whose heir was in ward to the Crown. Also the King had in hand six acres in Ashfield, which had been escheated because John de Sturchesle had obtained them without license from John de Esthope, who had held them in capite. 65 In possession of R.

The word is said to be Celtic, and to denote \"a, valley;\"1 aud this opinion is so in conformity with other evidence that, without pretending to discuss the matter philologically, I hesitate not to accept it. OOylen (Saxon), and fHclin (British), both signify \"a Mill,\" while fHillgn (in the latter language) is \" a violet.\" Again, the Saxon adjective QDili]-c signifies \" sweet.\" The various modes in which the name before us has been spelt and pronounced leave the question of its etymology uncertain. I have stated what I conceive to be the alternatives. Domesday notices the Manor of Millichope thus : \u2014 \" The same Helgot holds (of Earl Roger) Melicope. Gamel held it (in Saxon times), and was free. Here is i hide geldable. There is (arable) land (sufficient) for iii ox-teams. In demesne there is one (such team) and mi Serfs. Its old value was 50s. (per annum). Its present value is 15s.\"3 I have already recited the Charter or alleged process by which Earl Roger gave \"Milinchope\" to St. Milburg in exchange for Eardington.3 This was probably at the period inlm'edtately succeeding Domes day ; but it is strange that the gift was {fc^ompanied by no mention of Helgot's previous interest in Millichope, and that there is no formal statement of his necessary concurrence in such a transfer.4 The truth of the Charter is nevertheless confirmed by all subse quent history; for Millichope is never again mentioned in connexion with the Barony of Helgot, but only with the Fief of St. Milburg. 1 Salopia Antiqua, p. 267. 2 Domesday, fo. 258, b, yj 3 Vol. I, 109.

We have seen how that early in the twelfth Century one Stephen, a Clerk (probably Rector of Munslow), claimed the two Milinsopes (Upper and Lower), to belong parochially to Mulsleie (Munslow) ; how also the Viceroy of Henry I in full Court at Castle Holgate annihilated this and every other claim which trespassed on the spi ritual jurisdiction of St. Milburg.5 There can be bttle doubt I think, that the Domesday Manor of Millichope (involving Upper and Lower Millichope and Hunger ford) had been iu Munslow Parish ; but the temporal change from Helgot's Barony to St. Milburg's Fief worked, rightfully or not, a spiritual transfer. Let us see what allowance the Viceroy awarded to the Rector of Munslow for his implied losses : \u2014 \" There is nevertheless conceded to Stephen, not in virtue of his claim, but for the sake of peace and for love of his Lord, the tithe and the sepulture of the Rustics of Lower Milinsope and the third garb of the tithe of the same Lord ; so also as that if any of them shall have desired to be buried at Weneloc, his acknowledgment being first made to the Church of Mulslaye, he shall not be forbid den to be thereafter buried at Weneloc.\" This \"concession,\" made about a.d. 1115, has worked in a most remarkable manner. At this very day Lower Millichope is in Munslow Parish, \"while Upper Millichope and Hungerford are in St. MUburg's Parish of Eaton. Again, the Prior of Wenlock, though Lower Millichope was not in his Parish of Eaton, retained till the Dissolution a part of the tithes thereof, viz. 8s. per annum, which in the Valor of 1334\u2014 5 is described as a Portion from the Vill of Millichop, and in 15-41-2 as the ferm of the tithes of Mil lichere Inferior.6 I must now speak separately of the several constituents of the Domesday Manor, inasmuch as their history is by no means identical. Lower Millichope. \u2014 The person designated in the above Char ter as \" Lord of Stephen, Clerk of Munslow,\" was perhaps Lord of Munslow itself.7 He would seem more surely to be Lord of Lower Millichope, and if so, I suppose he must have held the latter under the Prior of Wenlock. His name in either or both capacities seems left to conjecture. 5 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 233 G Monasticon, V, 81. I think, of Munslow, but I cannot show that Lower MiUichope remained in tenure of any of Ids successors.

He did suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament, and his antecessors had been wont to do suit to Munslow Hundred till the time of King Richard I. Lower Millinghop was half a hide.\"8 All I can say further of this Peter de Lascy is that he occurs in the following year, 1256, with Margery his wife, as having been party to a suit of mort d'ancestre, apparently concerning lands in Herefordshire.9 Cotemporary with Peter de Lacy we find Robert de Lacy, a Knight, holding more than one estate in Shropshire under different Lords. How he was related to Peter I cannot say, but it would seem that the eventual succession of both was in the same person, a female. \u2014 This was Amicia, wife, first of Thomas de Grete (by whom she had a son and heir Roger), secondly, of William de Schippeye. I shall elsewhere dwell more fully on this succession, but it was ne cessary to say thus much here in order to explain a Fine, now to be cited, by which Amice divested herself and her descendants of all concern in Lower Millichope.10 This Fine was levied at Westminster, in June, 1293, between Philip Burnel, Plaintiff (querentem), alnd William de Schippeye, with Amice his wife, Deforciants, of the Manors of Wodeton, Walton, Parva Milinghope, and Oneburi, and the Advowson of the Church of Oneburi, all in the County of Salop, whereof was Plea of Convention. William and Amice acknowledged the premises to be the right of Philip, by their own gift ; \u2014 to hold the same for ever, to him and his heirs, of the Lords of the respective fees. And William and Amice and the Heirs of Amice shall warrant the same. For all this Philip conceded to William and Amice and to Roger de Grete, son of the said Amice, the Manors of Welewe, Mardele-Philippi, and Aytemunsichet with the Advowson of the last, all in Hertfordshire. \u2014 To hold to William, Amice, and Roger, and to the heirs of Roger lawfully begotten, of the chief Lords of the Fees, \u2014 with remainder, failir^g lawful issue of Roger, to Matdda his Sister, and her lawful issue,\u2014 with remainder, failing such issue, to Agnes, Matilda's sister, and her lawful issue; \u2014 failing which, remainder to the right heirs of Amice. s Rot.

The Inquest held in July, 1294, on the death of Philip Burnel, represents him to have held certain lands in Millinghop of the Prior of Wenlock, by a rent of 20s.11 The Feodary of March, 1316, gives William de Ercalwe as one of the Lords of Millinghope.12 He was doubtless Tenant to the Burnels here, as he was at High ErcaU. In 1521-2, the Foreign Rent-Roil of Wenlock Priory includes 20s., still receivable from the \" Lord of Nether Mdlynchope,\" whose name however is not mentioned.13 Upper Millichope. \u2014 The Feoffees, who held this Manor under the Prior of Wenlock, were also hereditary Foresters of that vast jurisdiction, which, in its original state, was known as the Long Forest. They were therefore immediate servants of the Crown, and their names not unfrequeutly appear on public occasions. The first of this family of whom I find notice was Thomas de Millinghope, who, between the years 1169 and 1176, attests Char ters of Peter, Prior of Wenlock, and of Hugh de Periers, Lord of Ditton. In 1199 Roger de Millinghope fined one merk with King John, for having the bailiwick of the Long Forest, which his Father had held.1* In November, 1221, Thomas and Roger de Millingehop are pledges for Peter le Macun, who neglected to prosecute a lawsuit.16 Within the next five years Roger de Mdlinghop attests a deed, which concerned a Brother Forester and the Prior of Wenlock.16 On February 3, 1243, Roger de Millinghop has essoign in the suit of dower, wherein he was impleaded at Westminster by Agnes, widow of Roger Stosty.17 In Trinity Term following, the Plaintiff, called widow of Roger Tosty, appeared in support of her claim to a third part of half a virgate in Millingehop ; but the Justices ad journed the case till the next Her, and we hear no more of it.18 On March 2, 1249, the King ordered Inquisition to be made as to the estate of Roger de Milliugehope, deceased. The Return says that he had held nothing in capite of the King, but he held a ca rucate of land in Millinghope, of the Prior of Wenlock, to whom 11 Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I, No. 45, c.

He had also held an acre of land iu Eston (Aston Munslow) , of William de Camera, and a meadow, of William de Furches. His whole estate was worth \u20ac6. yearly. Juliana, his daughter and heir, was sixteen years of age, but the Jurors knew not where she was.19 In 1250 the arrentation of Geoffrey de Langley assessed an annual rent of 7s. on the heirs of Roger de Millinghop, and on Juliana, his Mother, for seven acres in Millinghop;20 \u2014 probably as sarted land within jurisdiction of the Forest. It appears that Geoffrey de Langley took other cognizance of this estate ; for Thomas de la Mare having married the above-named heiress, and holding thereby the Royal Forestership already men tioned, was questioned as to the legality of such marriage before the said Justiciar. The Wenlock Jurors who reported this in the Inquisition of 1255, did not state the result, but they stated elsewhere that \u2014 \" Thomas de la Mare was Lord of High Mdligehop, and held the vill of the Prior of Wenlock, at an annual rent of \u00a31. 12s. 6d., and did suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament,\" and that \" his ante cessors, till King Richard's time, did suit to Munslow Hundred.\" \"High Mdlichope,\" they said, \"was half a hide.\"21 Thomas de la Mare was himself on this Jury, as was he also on the Jury of Wenlock Liberty, at the Assizes of January, 1256. On March 19, 1262, he sat as a Forester of the Fee, on an Inquest held at Brug;23 at Michaelmas, 1267, I find him owing an amercement of 20s. for some non-attendance ; and further I cannot say of him or his de scendants, \u2014 except that Roger de la Mare was a Forester of the Fee on the great Perambulation of 1300, 23 and that the Feodary of 1316 gives Ralph de la Mare as one of the Lords of Millinghope.34 In 1521-2, the Foreign Rent-Roil of Wenlock Priory gives 30s. as the Chief- Rent payable by the Lord of Over Myllynchope, but does not give the said Lord's name.35 An old House still remains at Upper Millichope, the detads of which are well worth the notice of Antiquaries, but more appro- priate to a Work on Domestic Architecture than to the present un- 13 Inquisitions, 33 Hen.

Upper Millichope Chapel \u2014 occurs to my notice only once, and then as an affiliation of the Church of Eaton-under-Heywood. This has been already alluded to.27 &tokt dt jHtiinircj, There were several Stokes in Shropshire, which is not to be wondered at, seeing that the Saxon word 8c6c signified a village, or inhabited place. In course of time the several places thus named came to be distinguished by some adjunctive term. The one before us, called at one time God-stake, at another Stoke St. Milburg, owes each name to the spiritual fief of which it was a member. Of the many Legends about St. Milburg, most, I believe, already exist in print. There is one however still current among the In habitants of Corve-Dale, which has been hitherto neglected, but which, as it specially concerns Stoke St. Milburg, may stand side by side with our more commonplace details.1 Domesday describes the extensive Manor under notice thus : \u2014 \"The same Church (St. Milburg' s) held Godestoch (in Saxon 26 \" The lower Story seems to have been used as a storehouse or barn, the upper as a dwelling. The precautions against attack are elaborate. The architectural detads of the principal Door aud Window belong to the thirteenth century ; but the stones winch now form a round Arch in the doorway are not in situ, and (being sculptured with the ball-flower ornament) probably formed a pointed arch originally. This factitious form of the Arch conveys, at first sight, a notion of greater antiquity than the other details wdl warrant.\" \u2014 I am indebted for these remarks to Mrs. Stackhouse Acton. S Supra, Vol. III. p. 314.\u2014 This de stroyed Chapel perhaps furnished the stones of the doorway arch, above described. 1 I am indebted in this matter to the kindness of two Contributors, \u2014 to one (Mrs. Stackhouse Acton), for eoUecting the particulars of the Legend ; to another (Miss Petit), for combining the local tra dition with other more generally asserted facts, and in an appropriate form."], [451, "\u00a7E fUgrnur of S. iBiUmrgc.

In time of King Edward the Manor was worth \u00a313 (per annum) ; now it is worth ,\u20ac9.\"2 I have before stated that Stoke St. Milburg reverted to Wenlock Priory, and probably as the Earl's Chaplains died off. The Domesday Manor must be taken to have included Stoke, The Moor, Clee-Downton, Newtown, Bockleton, Kinson, Norncott, aud The Heath. In none of these except The Heath and Norncott had the early Priors of Wenlock any Tenant-in-Fee. They held the bulk of the Manor partly in demesne, but mostly leased out to Life-Tenants, in the mode of which the Wenlock Fine-Roll of 1321-2 has already afforded us so many examples. Of the early history of estates thus managed we necessarily know but little. Transactions between Lord and Tenant, though nume rous enough, were on a small scale and confined to Manorial Courts. In 1230-2 the Prior of Wenlock had much trouble on behalf of his Tenants of Stoke, who suffered from the exactions of Walter de Clifford, of Corfham. The latter had, or asserted himself to have, certain rights in his Forest of Clee and Ernestree, and the juris diction of that Forest, originally Royal, extended over the Priors' Manors of Stoke and Ditton. The particulars of this dispute and its termination I will give in another place. The Wenlock Jurors of 1255 gave an account of the Manor of Stoke which I cannot think to have been quite accurate originally. The printed copy thereof contains also some verbal error. The entry is as follows : \u2014 \" Sthoke with its appurtenances is a Manor of the said Prior\" (of Wenlock), \"viz. Hunton\" (where read Dunton, i.e. Clee-Downton), \" Newton, Bothton \" (i. e. Bockleton) \" and Ekine staneston \" (i. e. Kinson). Then the Jurors give particulars of cer tain Tenures-in-fee at Clee-Stanton, Heath, and Norncott; and con clude as follows : \u2014 \" The Jurors also say that the Manor of Sthoke, with its appurtenances and with the aforesaid Vills, contains in itself xx hides.\"3 \u2014 The intention of these Jurors was evidently to give account of the contents of the Manor of Stoke as measured by its Domesday hidage. | 3 Rot.

They also adopted an arrangement which distinguished those mem bers of the Manor which were held in Fee from the ordinary mem bers. Their mistake consisted, either in estimating Clee-Stanton at all as a member of Stoke, or else in limiting Stoke to 20 hides. Clee-Stanton was, at the time of Domesday, a distinct Manor. It contained n hides in itself, and was in Culvestan, not in Patinton Hundred. At present, therefore, I continue to speak generally of the Manor of Stoke St. Milburg, exclusive of Clee-Stanton. \u2014 In 1291 the following was the valuation of the Prior of Wenlock's interests here.

MILBURG. A Church has probably existed here from time immemorial, and in the gift of Wenlock Priory. It was not, like most of the Prior's Churches, in the Deanery of Wenlock, but in that of Ludlow. Its Parish included not only the Manor of Stoke, but also that of Clee Stanton. In 1291 the Church was still a Rectory, valued at \u00a310. 13s. 4c?. per annum, over and above the portion of \u00a33. which the Prior of Wenlock derived therefrom.9 Hence in his Charter of May 27, 1331, the Bishop of Hereford expresses himself satisfied as to the Prior's title to a pension in this Church. In 1341 the Taxation of Stoke Mylborgh Church is correctly cited as 20| merks (\u00a313. 13s. 4c?.) ; but the Assessors of the ninth charged the parish only \u00a34. 10s. on the wheat, wool, and lamb of the district, because the wheat was for the most part destroyed by 0 Register at WiUey, so. 40, b.

Also the small tithes, offerings, and glebe went to make up the greater taxation and were not now to be reckoned.10 Soon after this the Prior of Wenlock, not content with his pension from this Church, sought an appropriation thereof as well as of that of Madeley. The process is worth recording. \u2014 The Prior first petitions11 the Bishop, Dean and Chapter of Here ford, stating the poverty of his house, aud asking to appropriate these two Churches, \" of which, according to the current taxation, the in come does not exceed 28 merks.\"12 Thomas the Bishop, Stephen the Dean, and the Chapter of Here ford, by their Charter, dated March 17, 1342 (i. e. 1343), recite the Prior's Petition, and direct the Dean of Wenlock to make inquiry as to its truth, and send in his report before Sunday in ramis pal marum (April 6, 1343). The Dean of Wenlock, by letter dated March 28, 1343, certifies both the poverty of the Priory, and the joint value of the Churches, as already asserted. His inquiries have been assisted by John Aaron, Rector of the Chapel of Borewardesley (who, be it observed, was also Rector of Madeley), Richard, Rector of the Chapel of Mit telton, William, Vicar of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, and other Clerks and Laics. On June 26, 1343, the Charter of Thomas, Bishop of Hereford, dated in the Chapter-House there, and ratified by the Dean and Chapter, allows the appropriations sought for. He recites the King's (Edward Ill's) license to the same effect.13 He directs that, on the deaths of the present Rectors, Vicars be appointed to the two Churches, with competent portions. The Priory is to pay a merk 10 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 188. the Prior's pension from Stoke, the tax ation of Stoke was 16 merks. That of Madeley was 12 merks. 11 These particulars are taken from a Fragment of a very fine Chartulary of Wenlock Priory. The Fragment (only 12 leaves) is in the Duke of Sutherland's pos session and has been incorporated in the LiUeshaU Chartulary. This mistaken arrangement is of no modern date ; for an old Index (written I think by Le Neve) treats the two Chartularies as if paged continuously and fonning a systematic whole. 13 The Royal License for these appro - priations bears date at Woodstock, June 21, 1342. The King had \u00a320. for the same. His Patent speaks of the Priory being \"in his hand by reason of the war with France,\" a circumstance which in point of fact made him Patron of the Churches. He grants flie license notwithstanding. (Patent 16 Edw. Ill, p. 2, memb. 36.) 12 This was quite correct. Deducting"], [458, "12 STOKE ST.

Richard de Weston, last Rector of Stoke St. Milburg, resigned, in the Prior's chamber on June 30, 1344, before many witnesses. At this time the See of Hereford was vacant ; so Master John Rees, Canon of Hereford and Vicar General of John, Bishop elect, being at Stottesden on July 30, 1344, wrote to the Dean of Ludlow, or dering him to induct the Prior of Wenlock into the Rectory of Stoke. On July 31, Griffin de Weston, Perpetual Vicar of Staun ton Lacy and Dean of Ludlow, inducted the Proctor of the Prior (appointed by letters of proxy dated July 27 previous, under hand of the Prior) into corporal possession of the Church of Stoke, in presence of Sir Henry de Laverden, Parochial Chaplain of the Church of Stoke. On October 3, 1344, Guychard, Prior of Wen lock, assigns to Sir Robert, \"Perpetual Vicar of our Church of Stoke,\" the house and land held by former Incumbents at The Heath, and (for his salary) the small-tithes and oblations of Stoke. Out of these however he is to pay 6s. 8d. yearly to the Choir of Hereford. In 1369 the Church of Stoke is valued at \u00a310, i. e. the Rectorial interest therein.1* In 1534, Thomas Haryngton being Vicar of Stoke-Mylburg, his Vicarial tithes were valued at \u00a36. 3s. 4c?., and his glebe at 10s. per annum. He was chargeable with 14s. 4cl. for synodals and procu rations. The Impropriators were the Prior and Convent of Wen lock.

These Barons had, early in the 13th century, a Tenant at The Heath, one William fitz John ; and he again had his Under-tenants there, as will appear by the following document. On Nov. 24, 1236, a Fine was levied at Salop, between Peter fitz Reginald, Plaintiff, and Wdliam fitz John, Deforciant, of 2 virgates in Hethe, whereof was Plea, etc. Peter renounced his claim, whereupon William fitz John granted half a virgate in the same vill to Peter, Amice, wife of Peter, and Alice, Mother of Peter, to hold for the longest of their three lives, at a rent of 7s., \u2014 with reversion to Wil liam and his heirs.1 In Easter Term, 1241, I find Peter fitz Reginald suing William fitz John at Westminster, \" that he should keep the fine made at Salop.\" \u2014 The Defendant appeared not.2 About this time William fitz John is entered as holding by ser vice of a Knight's-Fee under the Barons of Holgate.3 Probably however the entry does not primardy relate to his tenure at The Heath. In Nov. 1248, the following Fine was levied between William fitz John and his Suzerain, William Mauduit, whom he had been suing, to aUow him to turn his swine into Castle-Holgate wood during the mast season, free of pannage. The Fine was a conces sion by Mauduit of the right claimed, but only for thirty swine, and excepting the Park from all such intrusion. Mauduit also allowed the Plaintiff a right of common-pasture. The Plaintiff in return renounced all rights for any number of swine above thirty, and all common pasture in the Park or Garden of William Mauduit.4 In Easter Term, 1250, William fitz John was suing William Mauduit at Westminster for non-observance of this Fine.5 In the same Term William fitz John was a Defendant in the same Court in a much more serious matter ; viz. to give answer to Herbert de Corfton as to wherefore he, WdUam, had seized the working cattle and chattels of Herbert, and still detained the same unjustly. Herbert stated that on St. Andrew's Day (Nov. 30), 1248, William came with his power, to Herbert's house at Corfton, about midnight, and took 8 cattle, 6 sheep, 5 cart-loads of corn, 2 carts, and of other chattels 5 horse-loads, whereby he (Herbert) 1 Pedes Finium, 21 Hen.

William denied the charge of violence, and said that Herbert was his Villain, and had fled from his land, and had refused, when required, to act as Wdliam's Bailiff (prepositus) ; moreover he (William) had seized nothing but cattle. William was hereupon asked by the Court if he had any free tenement in Corfton, and if he had ever claimed Herbert as his native in the County-Court, and by writ-royal ? To both questions he answered in the negative ; whereupon the Court ordered him to restore the cattle, and to be sent to gaol. As to the sheep and other chattels, he appealed to a Jury, and the Sheriff had orders to summon a Jury accordingly, and to report the result at Westminster on June 25. Meanwhile the Parties accorded, WiUiam giving the King 5 merks for license so to accord, by Surety of William Mauduit. Herbert renounced all charge as to chattels and damages. WiUiam paid Herbert \u00a32., and gave him back 1 cow and 2 carts.6 It is observable that in the above action a part of the criminal charge which reaUy lay against William fitz John was not alluded to. Five years afterwards (viz. at the Assizes of January, 1256), the Munslow Jurors presented that William fitz John had, on the night of St. Andrew, 1248, imprisoned Herbert de Corfton, Ma tilda his wife, and John his son, at The Heath.7 In Michaelmas Term, 1251, and after an apparent sdence of ten years, I find Peter fitz Reginald suing Robert (read William) fitz John, that he should hold to the Fine made before Justices Itine rant at Salop, concerning two virgates in Heth, whereof was Cyro graph.

The Defendant not appearing, had summons for Feb. 3 following, and the land meanwhile was to be seized into the King's hand. The nature and result of this suit will appear presently.9 In 1255 the Jurors of Wenlock Liberty found William fitz John to be \" Lord of The Heath.

Hence the fodowing Fine between Prior Imbert, as Plaintiff, and Mauduit, as Voucher of William fitz John, \u2014 concerning 2 carucates in La Hethe, whereof was recognition of Grand Assize. The Prior acknowledged the same to be the right of WiUiam Mauduit, and gave them to be held of the chief Lords (that is of himself and Convent) . In turn William fitz John, at instance of WiUiam Mau duit, granted that he would pay the Prior a rent of 30s. for the same, and give a power of distress in case of default.11 Fitz John's other suits at these Assizes were with his own Under tenants. He was found to have disseized Thomas le Clerk of half a virgate and two acres in La Heth.12 He had also raised a stank in La Hethe, to the damage of the same Thomas's free tenement there. \"Let the stank be thrown down,\" said the Court. On the other hand, Alexander de Hethe had disseized WiUiam fitz John of a place of land in the Hethe ; and Nicholas fitz Andrew withdrew a suit of novel disseizin which he had against WilUam fitz John for common pasture here.13 In this same year (1256) WiUiam fitz John de la Hethe was re ported among those in Shropshire, who holding 15 Vibrates of land, were not yet Knights. Soon after this, William fitz John died, seized \" in demesne as of fee\" of The Heath. The King of Almagne, then Lord of Castle Hol gate, entered on the Manor as Suzerain. John, son and heir of William fitz John, hereupon procured a letter from the King of Al magne, ordering that the said heir, if of full age, should have seizin of the premises. Meantime however, and before this order could be acted upon, the said King's Bailiffs had given to AUna, widow of William fitz John, her dower in The Heath. This dower became afterward matter of some litigation, of which presently. \u2014 The King of Almagne's BaUiffs, on receipt of the King's Letter, finding John fitz WiUiam to be of age, gave him seizin of the residue of The Heath, apparently a messuage, 2 carucates of land, and 53s. annual rent.

And first as to the dowry.\u2014 At the said Assizes, \" John fitz John de Hethe sued the Earl of Arundel for a messuage, one and a half acres of meadow, three acres of wood, 11s. 6<1 rent, one and a half carucates, and half a virgate of land in Hethe juxta, Holegode's Castel,\"\u2014 whereof the Plaintiff alleged that his Grandfather, William fitz John, had died seized. The Earl replied with a mere technical plea, but at the same time a false one, viz. that after the death of WiUiam fitz John, John, his son, had had seizin of the premises, and he asked the Court to give judgment against this writ, which purported to be a writ instituting a trial concerning the death of the last in seizin. The Plaintiff hereupon denied his Father's seizin at any time, and the question went to the Jury, which found that Wdliam fitz John died seized of the premises, that they went in dower to his widow (as before recited), then to Isabel Fitz Alan, and then to Richard Earl of Arundel, the present Defendant. John fitz John hereupon had his recovery by order of the Court; the Earl was declared to be in misericordid, and his damages to the Plaintiff assessed at 5 merks.43 The question as to the other part of The Heath, viz. that which Alina had not had in dower, was very different, \u2014 and it is remark able that, though the Earl of Arundel might have maintained his title by a plain statement of facts in the first instance, he chose to quash the prosecution by a mere quibble, and only pleaded the facts on a second trial. \u2014 The Plaintiff was in error no doubt, for \" John fitz John de Hethe sued the Earl for one messuage, two carucates of land, and 53s. rent, etc. in Hethe,\" whereof the Earl was alleged to have no seizin \" except by demise of John fitz Wdliam (father of the Plaintiff) , made to John Fitz Alan, Senior, for a term, which term had now expired.\" The Earl, laying hold of the word \" Senior,\" seems to have stated (and with truth) that his Father, Grandfather, and Great-grandfather were all John Fitz Alans, that the most ancient of the three was the only one who could properly be described as John Fitz Alan Senior, and that he had never any transaction with 42 Plac. de Jura/is et Assizis, 20 Edw.

Its parochial subjection to the Church of Stoke St. Milburg is undoubted. In such a case we should not expect any evidence as to its endowment or Incumbents.

On that day William Mauduit, then Lord of Hol gate, sued him at Westminster for 2 carucates in Oxenbold as his right.

Meanwhde, the Prior had been showing no diffidence as to the validity of his Title. Notwithstanding the enormous expenses which the recent Her of Geoffrey de Langley had inflicted upon him, he fined in the year 1251, 300 merks with the King, that he might enclose, and keep enclosed, his Park of Oxenbold. The King's Charter of Nov. 4, 1251 (already quoted), embodies a license to that effect, adding that Oxenbold was within the bounds of the Forest.16 Before Michaelmas, 1252, the Prior had paid 100 merks of this specific fine, had been excused 50 merks, and still owed 150 merks.16 In 1255 the Jurors of Munslow Hundred, as well as of Wenlock Liberty, presented the state of this Manor. \u2014 Their joint account was that the Manor was half a hide, that Sir Robert de Girros had, ten years before, given it to the Prior of Wenlock ; that the Prior had attracted to himself (i. e. to his Franchise) the Suit of the Vill, and deprived Munslow Hundred thereof: that the King had already been damaged (as Lord of Munslow Hundred) to the extent of 25s. by this withdrawal, viz. 5s. for ten years' arrears of 6d. stretward and Motfee, and 20s. for ten years' Suit of Court, valued at 2s. per annum.

The Wenlock Jurors reported how he had made a Park at Oxenbold, to which the Munslow return adds a Vivary.17 A Deed which passed between the years 1251 and 1261 will fur ther dlustrate the Prior's activity in regard of Oxenbold Park. It was thus agreed between Sir Humbert, Prior of Wenlock, and Roger fitz WiUiam of Corfhull. \u2014 Roger grants a parcel of his land in Corfhull, viz. half an acre, between the River Corve and the Old Park, formerly Robert de Girros', and surrenders all rights within the enclosure of the said Park. The Prior grants to Roger free pasture, except for swine and goats, in such fallow-land in Oxne bold as lay outside his Parks, Woods, and Meadows, so as that no right of common-pasture could be demanded within the fences of the Prior's New Park in Oxnebold. Witnesses : Roger de Pyvles don, Roger de Girros, Roger de Weston, Peter son of Peter de Caleweton, Vivian de Castellione,18 Gdbert Marescall.19 The Taxation of 1291 proves that the Prior's Manor of Oxenbold was reputed to contain much more than had been spoken of (under that name) by the Jurors of 1255, or had been questioned in the Suit with William Mauduit. The truth seems to be, that the Domesday Manor (1 hide) had been dismembered earlier than 1255, when Oxenbold appears only as half a hide. Of its original mem bers, and their earlier alienation, we shaU say more presently. In 1291, the Manor of Oxnebold, whatever composed it, con tained seven carucates of arable land, held apparently in demesne by the Prior, and valued at 16s. per carucate, or .\u00a35. 12s. per annum.

BucljrijaU* Before I attempt to indicate those Domesday Members of Oxen bold, which, constituting half a hide, had before 1255 been severed from the original Manor, I must introduce an idea (I can call it nothing more) which I entertain as to that Manor in Patinton Hun dred, which the Record calls Buchehale. Domesday notices it thus briefly. \u2014 \" Wilham holds Buchehale. Elmer held it. Here is i virgate. There is arable land sufficient for half a team.

We must therefore look for some such place as Buchehale within the known area of Patintun Hundred, and I believe that under its Domesday name we shall look in vain. Let us endeavour to trace it by its Domesday owner, \u2014 William ; \u2014 and first we must decide who Wdliam was. This can be done satisfactorily by reference to the original Record. In the column, at the middle point of which the Ust of William Pantulf's Manors is broken off, there is a marginal mark opposite the last of the series (Sudtelch). This mark corresponds with another at the foot of the column, annexed to which, in paler ink and in supplementary form, are notices of the Condetret Manor of Ingurdine, and the Patintun Manor of Buchehale, the owner of which is respectively described as \"Isdem W\" and \"Wills.\" It is clear therefore that WiUiam Pantulf was Domesday Lord of the two small Manors of Ingwardine and Buchehale. But Wdliam Pantulf is not known to have had any subsequent interest in Ingwardine. The Seigneury of that Manor passed to Fitz Alan, as did also the Seigneury of other Pantulf Manors in South Shropshire. Now, as Pantulf is also known to have had nothing in perpetuity within the area of Patintun Hundred, we conclude that Buchehale passed either to Fitz Alan or to some Religious House, where aU evidence of the original seigneury became effaced. Such a House in this quarter could only be Wenlock Priory. Buchehale therefore, or whatever that name represented, must be looked for as afterwards involved in some Manor of Fitz Alan, or of the Prior, or of both. My idea is that the Domesday Scribe wrote \" Buchehale \" where he ought to have written \" Muchehale.\" There are three smaU tenements, lying nearly midway between Acton Round and Oxenbold, which are now known as Upper Monk hall, Lower Monk-haU, and Far Monk-hall, but which in 1255 were known as the three Mughales. The two former of these were then combined with Fitz Alan's Manor of Acton Round, the third with the Prior's Manor of Monk Hopton. At the Dissolution two of them seem to have belonged to Wenlock, and were described as Harpis Muckhall and Mukhole in Hopton.

In October, 1203, I find one WilUam de Hopton, apparently a knight, acting as Juror in a trial which concerned land in the same vill of Corve. It appears to me that this Wdliam must have been Lord of the Manor now under notice.1 I suppose also that Nicholas de Optun, who was attending the Prior's Court of Burton in March, 1227, was of this place.2 On November 22, 1248, Remund de Hopton, being caUed upon to warrant his Charter of a virgate and acre in Hopton to Roger Fitz Roger, did so in the King's Court at Shrewsbury, by a fine, wherein he acknowledged to have given the premises to said Roger, \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee. Roger is said to acknowledge the fine with a sore sparrow-hawk. An indorsement on the Fine states that the Prior of Wenlock opposes his claim.3 I believe this Roger Fitz Roger to have been identical with Roger de Weston, whom I shaU mention presently. In 1255 the Jurors of Wenlock spoke of Monk Hopton as a member of the Manor of Weston, instead of adopting the inverse classification which other circumstances suggest. They merely said that \"Weston with its appurtenances, viz. Hopton and Mughal, was a Manor of the Lord Prior of Wenlock.\"4 \u2014 They evidently knew nothing of the hidage or ancient status of the Manor thus described ; \u2014 and their ignorance was precisely the same as that which I now experience, and which nothing probably 1 Because neither of Hopton Cangeford, Hopton Wafre, or Upton Cressets, the only other places which can be taken into 2 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 341, note. 3 Pedes Finium, 33 Hen.

II indicates little with regard to the status of Hopton as a whole. Parts of it were held by Copyhold tenure, according to the usual customs adopted by Wenlock Priory, wherever it had power to introduce them. Another part may also have been held in fee, a matter on which of course that Record is silent. I have given all extracts from the said Fine-Roll, which relate to Hopton, Weston, and Monk Hall, under Oxenbold. In 1495-6, the rents of a Mill and Tenement in Hopton, amount ing to 6s. 4c?., specially belonged to the Kitchen of the Priory.5 Monk-Hopton Chapel. \u2014 That Monk Hopton and all the adja cent vills stood within the area of the aUeged Parish of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, is evident from the boundary of the latter already given. A Chapel nevertheless existed at Hopton from a very early period, as we learn from mention of Iverard, its Chaplain, in the twelfth Century. It may be doubted whether any succession of these humble func tionaries was pretended to be kept up. Of course none of them appear on the Diocesan Registers. Bishop Swinfield, by his Charter of Jan. 29, 1284, increases the previously fixed endowment of the Vicar of Wenlock, by giving him the Schrysicorn and Cornmol of Weston, Muchale, and Hop ton. This I have noticed before,0 and only observe here that the Bishop does not even mention a Chapel or Chaplain at Hopton. The Charter of Thomas, Bishop of Hereford (May 23, 1331), mentions and confirms to Wenlock Priory, the Chapel of Hopton, as a dependent of the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Spiritualities of Wenlock Priory, in 1369, are stated to in clude a receipt of \u00a33. 13s. 4d. from the Chapel of Hopton. This was doubtless the great tithe of the district, which I learn from another Schedule to have been appropriated to the support of the Convent, and which, in 1541-2, was, as we have seen, represented by the greater sum of \u00a34. 13s. 4d., at which the tithes of Weston Hopton and Muckhall were then farmed. The Pensions assigned by Henry VIII's Commissioners on Jan. 6, 1540, to the Fraternity of the late Priory, include one of \u00a35. 6s. 8d. to a Monk and Priest named William Morthowe.7 Monasticon, V, p. 80.

In 1545, the circumstance of William Morphoo having been a Monk is mentioned in conjunction with his being Curate of Monk Hopton ; but my authority8 does not supply the bearing of such a coincidence. WESTON. About 1220-30, one Roger de Weston attests a Deed which con cerned Patton, Corve, and Cawley. I think that Roger Fitz Roger, whose fine of 1248 has been no ticed under Hopton, was Roger de Weston's son, and identical with \"Roger, son of Roger de Weston,\" who in 1256 was concerned in Chaiicott.9 He was afterwards called Roger de Weston. At this time the Prior of Wenlock had footing in Weston, and it was called a Manor. The Jurors of Wenlock Liberty presented, long after, that Hymbert, Prior of Wenlock (he died in 1260), had made purjrresture on his own land in the Manor of Weston within the King's Forest, having warranty to do so, and that the locahty was put out of regard in Henry Ill's time.10 In the last half of the thirteenth century, I find Roger de Weston a frequent witness of local deeds. Also at the Assizes of 1272, the Inquest of 1274, and the Assizes of 1292, the same person was on the Jury for Wenlock Liberty. A step of succession is indicated by a Larden Deed, dated July 12, 1306, which is tested by Roger, son of Roger de Westone. The Fine-RoU of 15 Edw. II, already quoted under Oxenbold, indicates that the Prior had Copyhold Tenants here ; nor do the subsequent Rent-Roils of Wenlock show the continuance of that tenure in-fee which I suppose to have been enjoyed by the three Roger de Wes tons above mentioned. FAR MONK-HALL, OR PRIOR'S MUCKHALL. I have great difficulty in treating separately of three places which were adjacent, and not always described by any distinctive name. If therefore I confuse the Prior of Wenlock' s 'Tenants in Far Monk- Hall with Fitz Alan's Tenants at Upper and Lower Monk-Hall, the mistake is unavoidable. I think however that the Masons (the principal Tenants in question) held both under the Prior and under Fitz Alan.

At the Assizes of November, 1221, Peter le Macun and Alice his wife having a suit of mort d'ancestre against William le Macun failed to appear ; whereupon they were subject to Amercement, their Sureties being Thomas and Roger de Millingehop.12 On March 12, 1227, WilUam de Mughale was attendant at the Hundred Court of the Prior of Wenlock at Burton. In 1255 Wdliam le Mason, of Mughale, and his fellows, were amerced half a merk by Henry de Herwinton, a Justice Itinerant. They paid the same to Philip de Pres, Receiver of Robert de Gren don, then Sheriff of the County : but Philip gave no sufficient dis charge, and they had to pay the same again.13 At the Assizes of 1256 WiUiam Macun, of Mughale, was a Juror for Munslow Hundred. I have noticed already that this William le Mason was a Regarder of Shirlot Forest, in 1262.14 As such he and his CoUeagues were fined one merk in 1267, for some concealment.15 From this time tiU 1305 we find a person or persons described as Wdliam de Mughale or Wdliam le Mason, of Mughale, frequently attesting local deeds. Coincidently, William de Mughale was a Defaulter, reported by the Stottesden Jurors at the Assizes of 1272. Wdliam le Mason was a Juror of Munslow Hundred in 1272, 1274, and 1292. He occurs too on a Jury at Brug in 1278, on a Jury at Wenlock in 1289 (where a fellow-juror was Roger le Fleming, of Mughale), on other Juries at Brug in 1291 and 1294, and on ano ther at Wenlock in 1296. The name of Mason was among the Tenants of Wenlock Priory two centuries later. In 1495-6 John Mason was Tenant of a Mdl, and of a meadow and pasture near Bradley MiU, paying 12s. 10c?. to the Convent Kitchen.

The Saxon word Scan is more accurately preserved in compound names than in the simple form \" stone.\" Long-Stanton is distinguished from other Stantonsin Shropshire by a word which bore reference, I think, to the Parish rather than the Manor.

In no Record later than Domesday can I find the slightest hint that those Barons retained any interest in Long Stanton. That Manor I take to have been an Escheat of the Crown at least as early as the reign of Henry I. Of Herbert, the Domesday Tenant of Long Stanton, I would ob serve, that he seems to have been Lacy's Tenant elsewhere, viz. at Patton, Middlehope, and Corfton, aud to have also held Great Sut ton, under Helgot, at the time of the Survey. The subsequent tenures in Long-Stanton were of such a divided character that it is impossible to associate them with an abiding or general interest of any single Feoffee. I must therefore conclude that Herbert's tenancy here vanished during the same unchronicled period as put an end to the seigneury of Lacy. I proceed to speak of these divided Tenures with as much dis tinctness as a few very scattered evidences enable me. \u2014 Serjeantry of Long-Stanton. \u2014 This consisted of a small estate3 bestowed, together with More (near Lydham) and other lands, on one whose name is unrecorded, but whose office it was to act as a Constable of 200 foot-soldiers whenever any King of England in- 1 Domesday, so. 256, b. 1. 2 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 24. 3 The extent is variously described as 2 carucates, 1 carucate, and 1 virgate."], [481, "LONG STANTON. 33 vaded Wales. The descendants of the first Constable thus endowed took the name of More from the principal of their estates. Of them and their succession I shall speak in another place. Here it is only pertinent to say that one of these constables, at least as early as the twelfth century, granted whatever he had in Long-Stanton to a Tenant-in-fee. His right to do so was afterwards questioned, and his Descendants had to compound for his act by an annual pay ment to the Crown. The .rights of his Feoffee were not however brought into question. The first of these Tenants of whom I have found any mention was perhaps the original Feoffee : he was known as Simon de Stan ton, in or about the year 1174, when we find lnm attesting a deed of Guy le Strange, already given under Badger.4 About six years later the name of Simon dc Stanton follows that of Robert Walsh (Gualensis), and both occupy a very prominent position in the test ing-clause of that Corve charter which I have so often quoted. Simon de Stanton was succeeded by his son Thomas, who appears to have held this estate for at least 36 years, and to have made many subinfeudations thereof. The following Ust of his sales, as they are caUed, professes to give the proximate date of each, and with much probability. About 1215 he enfeoffed Geoffrey Griffin in 3 nokates (f virgate). About 1231 he sold to Henry de Lotwich one noke. About 1235 he sold to Richard, a Chaplain, half a virgate. About 1240 he sold to the same 15 acres. About 1243 he enfeoffed Roger de Thongland in 2 acres. About 1247 he sold to Sabina fitz Simon half a virgate, to Philip fitz Simon 9 acres, to Richard Dodinol 1 acre, and to Alice Brewer (Braciatrix) 1 acre. About 1251 he sold to Cecily, his daughter, 1 acre.5 The first feoffment, that of Geoffrey Griffin, is curiously substan tiated by a Deed in the Haughmond Chartulary,- whereby\u2014 Thomas, son of Simon de Staunton, grants to Geoffrey Griffin, for his homage and service, three bovates in Staunton, those namely of which Philip fitz Edric held, half a virgate, and Richard the Priest, one bovate,\u2014 rendering a pair of white gloves.

Further, the Hundred Rolls inform us that about 1235 Geoflrey Griffin enfeoffed the Abbot of Haughmond, in these premises. Again the Chartulary is in concert, for in one deed \u2014 \" Geoffrey Griffin exchanges with Haughmond Abbey for a vir gate in Besforde, those three bovates which he bought from Thomas fitz Simon. \u2014 Witnesses : John Fitz Alan, Henry de Audley, Vivian de Roshale.\" In another deed, \u2014 \" Thomas de Long Staunton, son of Simon de Long Staunton, confirms to the Abbey the three nokes in the vill of Long Staunton, which the Abbey had obtained by exchange with Geoffrey Griffin, Clerk. \u2014 Witnesses : Richard de MideUiope, Thomas de Roshall, Geoffrey Griffin Clerk, Bertram his Brother.\" The Hundred Rolls stdl further inform us that about 1236 the Abbot of Haughmond enfeoffed Brun Edrich in these premises for 7s. annual rent. The word \" enfeoffed\" seems to be here used at random. The Chartulary, though it does not supply the Abbot's charter to Brown Edrich, gives us a subsequent renewal to his Son, wherein \u2014 \" The Abbot demises to Richard, son of Edrich Brown, of Staunton, half a virgate, which his said Father, and Matdda, his Mother, had held for Use. The new rent is to be 13s. 4d.\"7 I can trace but little of the other subinfeudations granted by Thomas fitz Simon between 1215 and 1251. About that time however there was one Simon, Rector of Long Stanton, who seems to have been father of a numerous famdy if, as I guess, Phdip and Sabina above mentioned were his son and daugh ter. A son he certainly had, named Simon, who, before 1255, having a seignoral right over three nokates in Long Stanton, gave the rent thereof (9s. 3c?.) to Haughmond Abbey, together with his body in burial.8 The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot of Haughmond as seized of 17s. 4d. assized rent in Longestaunton.9 And his interests here continued till the Dissolution, for, in 1541-2, the Ministers' Accounts give a rent of 18s. from a Tenement in Long Staunton among the assets of the late Monastery.10 To return to an earlier period :\u2014 It was during Thomas fitz Simon's time that these Inquisitions 7 Chartulary, ibidem.

Roger de la More was then Lord of More, and com pounded for aU the alienations of his Predecessors by paying an annual rent of one merk to the Crown, in addition to the discharge of his service as Constable. This rent, whereof 5s. was the specific portion charged in respect of Long Stauuton,11 began to accrue from March, 1247. The various Feoffees paid their ratable shares to Roger de la More, while he accounted for the whole to the Sheriff. In the arrentation of 1247 Thomas de Long Staunton is said to hold one carucate in Long Staunton, the annual value of which to him was \u00a31. 6s. 8c?. \u2014 He was living in 1251, but was deceased in 1255, when his Grand son, Thomas, son of his son Reginald, was in possession. In that same year this second Thomas sold to Richard, Chaplain (a former purchaser in the Manor), rents of 18s. aud one pound of cumin arising from his Tenants here. He also sold to the Knights Tem plars of Lidley a moor of the annual value of 3s.13 In 1259 he fines half a merk to have some Assize13 \u2014 probably that assize of mort d'ancestre which, in October, 1259, Giles de Erdinton is commissioned to try, as \" arraigned by Thomas fitz Reginald, of Long Stanton, against Philip le Clerc.\" 14 The tene ment in dispute was in Long Stanton, and perhaps Phdip le Clerc was identical with Phdip fitz Simon, already mentioned. Again, in 1260, Thomas fitz Reginald fines half a merk for a writ of pone,15 wishing, I suppose, to change the venue of some lawsuit. Previous to this, and in or about the year 1256, we hear from another Record16 that Thomas fitz Reginald had enfeoffed the Knights Templars of Lidley in all his residue in Long Staunton. The Templars' interests, already existent in this quarter, were so multiplied in the next ten years that we lose all distinct notice of their specific tenure as Grantees of Thomas fitz Reginald ; but it was probably in his right that (as we shall see) they afterwards claimed the Advowson of the Church. 11 Vide Testa de Nevill, fos. 264, 268.\u2014 A fragment of an Assize RoU preserved in the same Record seems to be of date about 1251. It says, under Munslow Hundred (so. 274), with much inaccuracy, that \" Roger de la More, of Lidmesfield, holds one virgate in Longesdon by ser jeantry, the jurors knew not his service.\" Here the name Lidmcsfcld seems to be a confusion between Lydham and Linley.

Iii October, 1292, the Munslow Jurors represented how the Master of the Templars was holding the Vill of Long Stanton, which Thomas de Stanton formerly held by Serjeantry. The Master came into Court, and pleaded the seizin ot his Predecessor; but Hugh de Louther, the King's Attorney, was ordered to follow up the matter under writ of Quo Warranto?7 I do not find that this was done. An Escheator's RoU, apparently of the year 1316, and so after the forfeiture of the Templars, represents their late tenurein Staunton Long and Holt Preen as held of the King and of the Honour of Montgomery, by Serjeantry.18 The change thus indicated is a fitting point for concluding this branch of the subject, except to state that an Inquest taken previously (on Oct. 25, 1315), had found Long Stanton to have been an Escheat of the Templars, but to have been held of Edward BurneU's Honour of Castle Holgate without any service.18 What I shall have to say under Castle Holgate wiU nearly reconcile the two statements. Knights Templars' Fee. \u2014 This consisted of four virgates acquired by the Knights long before their feoffment by Thomas de Stanton. If, as is said, it was originaUy of the Fee of Castle Holgate, it follows that the Barons of Holgate had, on the first partition of Lacy's es tate here, obtained from the Crown a part of Long Stanton.19 There are many other considerations which make this probable, but here especially the propinquity of the forfeited land to Holgate Castle rendered it an object. The Tenant of these four virgates, whether under these Barons or not, was Robert Walsh, already noticed as a fellow-witness with Simon de Staunton about 1180. Even earlier than this, that is, previous to the year 1176, I find this Robertus Walensis attesting a Charter of Peter, Prior of Wenlock, concerning Hughley. \u2014 In Nov. 1194, he appears as Recognizor in an assize which I have mentioned under Hollicott.-0 \u2014 And further I cannot say of him, for I think it must have been his son, another Robert, who about the year 1225 is said to have given to the Templars the four virgates in Long Staunton which he held of the Fee of Castle Holgate.21 17 Placita Coron\u0153, memb. 3 dorso. 13 Escheat Roll : \u2014 embodied in Kirby's Quest.

The latter perhaps gave it with other estates to De Girros, the greatest Feoffee in their Barony, probably their near Relation. Certainly something in Stanton was included in the escheated estates of De Girros in 1194, something which yielded to the Escheator a return of 2s. on the half-year, for which he then accounts, and 2s. more on hatf a year, for which he accounts in 1195A Robert de Girros (II) seems to have had as Tenant in Stanton a Cadet of his own family.

I shall speak of this branch again under Poston, where they had more important interests than at Long Stanton.

Cotes. \u2014 I am by no means sure that what I have to say about a place thus called in Munslow Hundred relates to \" Coates-Farm,\" in the Parish of Long Stanton. If it does, then was this Cotes separated manoriaUy from Long Stanton, while the latter Manor was in the Crown, and granted to the King's Chief Forester for Shropshire, as part of his Serjeantry. The case of More's Serjeantry, similarly augmented by a part of Long Stanton, makes this idea plausible. The Chief Foresters of Shropshire were a succession of Knights descended from Ulger Venator, and seated at Great Bowlas, at least as early as the reign of Henry I. Their descent from that period is weU established. They held estates in Shropshire and Hereford shire in virtue of their hereditary office, and therefore by Serjeantry. The Uttle that is known of Cotes, one of the estates so held, is as follows : \u2014 A RoU of Shropshire Serjeantries, drawn up for purpose of some assessment, about the year 1200, intimates that Robert fitz Wd liam, the King's Forester for Shropshire, held a fourth part of a Carucate in Cote (of 4s. annual value), and 3s. rent there.28 A fragment of an Assize Roll, of October, 1227, tells us, under the presentments of Munslow, that \" Hugh fitz Robert holds 20 solidutes of land in Cotes, by service of keeping the Forests of Shropshire.\"29 Hugh fitz Robert was son and successor of Robert fitz Wdliam before mentioned. Previous to his death in 1249, he enfeoffed one Thomas le Moynur in a whole carucate in Cotes, re serving to himself only a rent of a pair of spurs. Thomas le Moy nur was succeeded by%a son of the same name, and the latter dying before 1272, left his son, a third Thomas le Moynur, in minority.

John fitz Hugh. The latter, on the death of Thomas le Moynur (II) seized the estate at Cotes, claiming to have custody of the Infant Heir. Hence we find that at the Assizes of Oct. 1272,30 Thomas le Moynur of Cotes claimed against John fitz Hugh a carucate in Cotes, whereof the Plaintiff alleged his Father to have died seized. This was a suit therefore of mort d'ancestre, which the Defendant met, not by denying the Father's seizin, but by ex plaining that he only claimed custody of the Heir. Thomas le Moynur (III) hereupon produced the Charter by which his Grand father had been enfeoffed by the Plaintiff's Father. That Charter is not set forth on the Rolls, but its terms seem to have been in consistent with John fitz Hugh's claim of custody. Sentence was given in favour of the Plaintiff, i. e. he recovered the estate at once. Clear as these particulars are, they do not inform us precisely where Cotes was, and I have searched in vain for further informa tion on the subject. My idea that it was Cotes, near Long Stanton, seems most consistent with all ascertained particulars, for every member of that Manor would certainly belong to Munslow Hun dred.31 LONG-STANTON CHURCH AND PARISH. At the time of Domesday the Church of this Parish was perhaps at Patton. About a century later we have mention of Walter, Chaplain of Stanton, which is the earliest indication I have of a change, probably effected very soon after Domesday. The Advowson was attached to the Tenure by Serjeantry, and Thomas de Long Stanton seems to have granted it to the Priory of Wenlock : for in April, 1245, a fine was levied at Westminster be tween Prior Hymbert, plaintiff, and Thomas de Longa Stanton, Impedient, of the Advowson of the Church of Longa Stanton, whereof was Plea of warranty of Charter. Thomas acknowledged the Prior's right, as arising by his own gift, and surrendered the said Advowson, \u2014 to hold to the Prior and his Successors in frank almoign, and Thomas and his heirs would warrant the same against aU men.

It appears that, on a subsequent vacancy, the Knights Templars of Lidley claimed, in the King's Court, the Advowson of this Church, but sued the Prior for the same to no purpose.33 I do not find, on the extant Plea-Rolls, the first proceedings in this cause, but the following indicates the period of the Suit and its result. In the Quinzaine of Michaelmas, 1266, the Justices sitting at Westminster found that a previous order of theirs had issued to the Sheriff of Shropshire, viz. \"that on the lands and chattels of the Master of the Knights Templars he should levy a sum of 20 merks, and should have the said sum here in Court, to be paid over to the Prior of Wenlock, seeing that the said Master had impeded the Prior in presenting to the Church of Long Stanton.\" The Sheriff not having obeyed the Writ, was enjoined to do so before three weeks of Hilary, 1267.34 On the Octaves of Hilary, 1267, there is a memorandum on the RoUs, stating that the Writ was still unfulfilled, and making it returnable in three weeks of Easter. \u2014 I hear no further of this matter. On Sunday, April 23, 1290, Richard Swinfield, Bishop of Here ford, then visiting his Diocese, was at Munslow. Corn-provender for the horses of his Suite was presented by the Rector of Long Stanton.35 The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Long Stanton in the Deanery of Wenlock, at \u00a313. 6s. 8c?. per annum, and enters it as belonging to the Prior of Wenlock.36 Meanwhde, however, that is before the year 1275, the Prior of Wenlock had given the Advowson of Long Stanton to the Dean and Chapter of Hereford, and John le Breton, Bishop of Hereford (who died in that year), had given license to the Chapter to appropriate the same on the next vacancy. This Vacancy occurred in 1294; and on April 29, 1295, Bishop Swinfield confirmed the appropriation aUowed by his Predecessor.37 In 1341 the Taxation of this Church being quoted at 20 merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8d.), the Assessors ofthe Ninth rated the Parish only at \u00a33. 10s. ; and 13s. 4>d. of the latter sum was specially apportioned on the Prior of Wenlock in respect of that share of the Ninth which belonged to his tempm-alities within the Parish.38 The reasons for 33 Memorandum in Hereford Register, sub anno 1294. 36 Pope Nich.

This place was perhaps at one time the caput of the Hundred to which it gave a name. Its importance does not seem wholly to have vanished at the time of Domesday, when it was thus noticed : \u2014 35 Inquisitionet Nonarum, p. 186. 40 Valor Ecclesiastic us, III, pp. 210 & 5. 41 From Blakeway's MSS. 42 Vide supra, p. 34. 6 IV."], [490, "42 PATTON. \" The same Roger (de Laci) holds of the Earl Patintune.

In time of King Edward, the Manor was worth 10s. (per annum), and subsequently it was waste. Now (it is worth) 24s.\"1 There is a remarkable parallel between this Manor and that of Long Stanton. They ever were, and stiU are, in the same Parish, though perhaps the Parish-church was originally at Patton. Alwin, the Saxon Lord of Patton, was doubtless identical with Eluuin, the Saxon Lord of Long Stanton. Roger de Lacy was the Domesday Lord, and Herbert the Domesday Tenant of both. Both were ulti mately lost to De Lacy's Barony. Both two had other features in common as regards their gradual and unexplained disintegration. Half of Patton passed to the Seigneury of Wenlock Priory, probably as early as the reign of Henry I., but by whose gift we are not told. It seems in the first instance to have been brought into the Prior's demesne, or rather into that class of estates which were disposed of to Tenants for life, according to an established custom of the Priory. A very ancient lease of this part of Patton is still in existence. Its date cannot be later than 1160, and as a specimen of this kind of document, it must be given entire : \u2014 \" Sciant presentes et futtiri quod Umbaldus Prior de Wenloch consensu Conventus concessit Arnaldo dapifero de Ludelaue terram de Patintuna tenendam in vita sua tantum.

II contain any fine referable to copyhold lands here. That part of Patton which I suppose to have been the subject of the above Lease, was afterwards granted in fee to a Tenant of the Prior : it was half a hide, a moiety therefore of the Domesday Manor. It paid a chief-rent of 13s. 4d. to the Prior of Wenlock, but, like other Lacy estates, it was charged with a service of Castle guard at Montgomery. This Incumbrance certainly originated at a period anterior to that at which Wenlock gained the said moiety, and wdiereas neither the Prior nor the above Lessee was charged with the said service, we conclude that the responsibdity rested with him who had granted the Land to the Priory. This points to Herbert de Furchis as the Grantor, for his descendants were chargeable with the service in question. The first apparent mention of any Tenant in Fee of the Prior is in the oft-quoted Corve Deed, about 1180, where Hugh de Patinton and John, his son, are witnesses. Hugh was, I suppose, succeeded by his son John. The latter appears to have been slain in the year 1213, by his neighbour, Roger de Presthope; at all events the said Roger was accused of the Deed by Juliana, the Widow, and Her bert, the Brother of the deceased.3 The next of this family of whom I find mention, was Stephen de Patinton. About 1225 he attests a confirmation by Humbert, Prior of Wenlock, quoted under Badger.4 In August, 1226, he appears amongst Knights and chief men of I have quoted under PosenhaU (supra, Vol. Ill, p. 285). - This Charter is in possession of Mr. George Morris, of Shrewsbury. Its date must be early in the time of Prior Hum bald, for four of the witnesses attest a Charter of Ids Predecessor Rainald, which 3 Patent, 15 John, p. 109. 4 Supra, Vol. II, p. 71."], [492, "44 PATTON. the county, on a Jury concerning the Forest rights of the Barons of Caus. In Trinity Term, 1230, he appeared at Westminster as Attorney for the Prior of Wenlock, in a suit with Walter de Clifford. Christiana, wife of Sir Stephen de Patinton, was an heiress : her lands lay at Smethcote and Pyklescote. As she had two husbands previous to her marriage with Stephen, we are not surprised to find his successors without any apparent interest in her estate. There is a Deed of Stephen de Patinton' s which I give in brief, merely remarking that the locahty concerned seems to be that which is now known as Cauley Coppice, and which, under the name of Calley, we noticed above in connection with Mughale and Monk Hopton : \u2014 \" Stephanus dominus de Patinton dedi, etc. Phdippo filio Thom\u00e6 dc Corve pro homagio et pro 10 solidis unam acram bosci mei de Kalflei ad assartandam, de libero tenemento meo juxta campum de Corve ad mensuram acrarum de Leiga.

Whether Hugh de Patinton, who succeeded Stephen, were his son I cannot say. He occurs on the Pipe-RoU of 1238, as being amerced 6s. 8c?. for unjust detention. In 1249 this Hugh, in conjunction with Alianore la Fleming (his wife apparently), is mentioned as party to a suit which concerned the estate of Walter le Fleming, at Wins bury. This matter I shall again refer to, but must now relate what the Wenlock Jiu*ors of 1255 said about the part of Patton now under notice : \u2014 \" Hugh de Patinton holds half a hide in Patinton of the Prior of Wenlock, and he pays the Prior one merk yearly, and does suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament ; and he does ward at Mont gomery in time of war for ten days, with two Serjeants and horses and two hauberks.\" At the same time Hugh de Patinton was a Juror for Munslow Hundred. He was also Co-parcener in the Manor of Stanwardine in the Fields, which was a recognized member of the Honour of Montgomery.6 3 In possession of Mr. George Morris. | 3 Rot. Bund. II, 69, 75, 85."], [493, "PATTON. 45 The Munslow Jurors of 1255 speak of the Wenlork share of Patinton somewhat differently to the Wenlock Jurors, and add in formation as to the other share. It appears that the whole of Pat ton was in some sort reputed to be in Munslow Hundred, if not a member of the Manor of Corfton. If I understand the Record rightly, Hugh de Patiton held half a hide in Patton of the Prior of Wenlock, doing ward at Montgomery in proportion to one-third of a Knight's Fee, but doing it through William de Furehes, then Lord of Corfton. The other moiety of Patton (half a hide) was held by the same Hugh de Patiton under Walter de Hopton, and for this he did suit to Munslow Hundred and paid the King 6d. per annum for Stret ward and Motfee. Under whom Hopton held we are not told.7 I find Hugh de Patiton on a local Jury of Dec. 2, 1.258, and in February, 1262, he appears as a Regarder of the Long Forest. In 1269, John le Fevre of Patinton is fined half a merk for default in some attendance. In 1273-4, Hugh de Patiton and John his son joined Thomas de Brocton in resisting a trespass on a meadow of the latter ; the aggressor, PhiUp de Cherlecote, was wounded in the fray which ensued. On this pretext Ralph de Mortimer, then Sheriff, imprisoned Hugh de Patiton, and distrained the goods of John de Patiton and of Thomas de Brocton tdl he had extorted a sum of 20s. from each of the three.8 I suppose that John de Patinton, who sat on a Jury at Wenlock, in October, 1289, was then Lord of the Vill, and was identical with John son of Hugh, above-mentioned. In May, 1296, a third Hugh de Patinton occurs on a simdar Jury, and is a witness of several deeds of that period. In 33 Edw. I (1304-5), Hugh, son of Hugh de Patiton (a younger son, I imagine), quits, to Hamund, son of Richard Faber, and Alice his wife, half a virgate of land. Witnesses : John de Brocton, William le Masoun of Moghale, Thomas de la Merhous.9 On Feb. 17, 1306, Thomas de Patinton was on a Jury at East hope. The Feodary of March, 1316, places Patyton in Munslow Hun dred, and returns it as in possession of Sibil de Patyton.10 Soon after this, - if the family of Patton did not become extinct, their Tenure in Fee seems to have lapsed to the Priory. The other moiety of Patton, of which I now return .to speak, 7 Rot. Bundred, p. 70. 8 Rot. Hundred, IT, 101. 9 Newport Evidences (Blakeway). 10 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 398."], [494, "46 PATTON. did not pass to Wenlock till the fourteenth Century. Herbert de Furches, the first witness of Prior Humbald's Lease (before 1160), was, I think, Lord thereof at the time. Possibly he represented Herbert, the Domesday Tenant of the whole Manor. This moiety of Patinton constituted, I think, a part of those three Knight's Fees of old feoffment, which WiUiam de Furcis held in 1165 under Hugh de Laci. About one of these Fees there was a doubt whether it was assessable to any service, in fact, whether it was a Fee at all : Laci never had received any service therefrom.11 In 1240, WdUam de Furcis held a Fee in Corfton, of Laci's Shropshire Barony.12 The Tenure, I think, included a moiety of Patinton, though the Record does not say so. In 1255, Walter de Hopton's tenure of a moiety of Patinton, over Hugh de Patinton, is clear, as already quoted ; \u2014 that he held it under William de Furcis, Lord of Corfton, is not quite so evident from the Record, but as much is, I think, implied. The Feodary of 1284 names Patynton (this moiety thereof is meant) under Munslow Hun dred, and says that it was held of Walter de Hopton by the fourth part of a Knight's-Fee ; but it was not known of whom the said William (read Walter) held it,13 neither does the record mention the Under-Tenant (Hugh or John de Patinton). The Interest of WiUiam de Furches at Corfton passed to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and WeUs, and I doubt not that this moiety of Patton went with Corfton as an appurtenance. Lacy's seigneury in neither con tinued with his coheirs, and Walter de Hopton's mesne interest in Patton vanished. In 1316 Sibd de Patinton was, as we have seen, Lady of the whole of Patinton, holding probably half under the Prior of Wenlock, and hatf under the Barony of Burned. Next we shall see how, in 1363, the Prior of Wenlock bought up the Under-Tenant's interest, whatever it was, in this moiety of Patton, and so reduced the whole to his own jurisdiction. On April 5, 1363, King Edward III orders inquiry to be made whether it would injure the Crown if Master Henry de Shipton, Hugh Yong Clerk, John Vicar of Wenlock, and John Come (evidently trustees) were to convey to the Prior of Wenlock the Manor of Patynton, a third of the Manor and Advowson of Broseley, and a messuage in Wenlock, as part of lands to the value of twenty merks per annum, which the Prior had the King's license to purchase. The answer given by Inquest on June 22nd was as regards all 11 Liber Niger, 1, 154. 13 Kirby't Quett. 12 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 50."], [495, "47 ROUTHALL, OR RUTH ALL. the premises that the transfer would not injure the Crown, as re gards Patinton, that it was held by the proposed Vendors under Sir Nicholas Burnel, by a rent of a half-penny, that it was worth 15s. per annum. A second Writ Royal, dated July 5, orders inquiry to be made of the true value of the Manor of Patinton, and the third of Broseley. The return, dated August 14, states that a carucate of land, two acres of meadow, and certain rents in Patinton, were worth, alto gether, 18s. 2d. yearly.14 The Prior doubtless concluded the proposed purchase. Hence, in 1379, the Prior is said to have a capital messuage in the hamlet of Patiton. He had also two-thirds of a carucate in demesne, which were worth 3s. 4c?. per annum, and an acre of meadow worth Is. His assized rents, of free tenants there, are stated at 40s. Total, \u00a32. 4s. 4d.15 Of this sum it is probable that a part arose from the land which had long been of the Prior's Seigneury. The residue wiU have been the issues of the other moiety of Patton, which the Prior had purchased in 1363. Iu 1541-2 (after the Dissolution) the Capital Messuage and demesne lands of Patton were at ferm for a rent of \u00a33. 2s. per annum.16 I here quit a subject full of difficulty, and which, as regards the succession of De Laci, De Furchis, and De Hopton, I have been compelled to treat in outline. That defect wUl in some degree be remedied by what I shall hereafter have to say under Corfton, Mid dlehope, and other places. &outIjaU, or &ut!)all< This place now forms, together with Ashfield, a township in the Parish of Prior's Ditton; \u2014 the only township therein which is in Munslow Hundred. This was because the Prior of Wen lock, though temporal Lord of Ditton, never obtained ingress into RuthaU or Ashfield, and so could not unite them to his Franchise. RuthaU was however distinguished from Ashfield in ancient 14 Inquisitions, 37 Edw. Ill (Second I 15 Monasticon, V, pp. 77, 78. Numbers), No. 53. i6 Monasticon, V, 80, Num.

Oschil held it (in Saxon times) and was a free man. Here is half a hide geldable. There is (arable) land (sufficient) for ii ox-teams. In demesne there is half a team, and (there are) ii Neat-herds and m Boors with half a team. In time of King Edward the Manor was worth 6s. (per annum) : now it is worth 8s.\"1 So Gerelmus held RuthaU of Gerard de Tornai, Gerard of the Norman Earl, the Earl of the King. Consequently on the forfeiture of Gerard de Tornai, and the faU of the Norman Earls, the mesne tenures between Gerelmus and the Crown were effaced, and we ex pect at later periods to find the representatives of Gerelmus holding RuthaU in capite. And so it came to pass, for the Sandfords, who after Domesday became Lords of Sandford (another Tornai Escheat) , held both that and RuthaU immediately of the Crown. Their service was at first that of half a Knight's fee, but afterwards by Serjeantry. Whether the Sandfords, besides being successors to Gerelmus at RuthaU, were also his descendants, I cannot venture to declare ; nor shaU I now say much of their succession, except as occasionaUy connected with RuthaU ; for they enfeoffed an Under-Tenant here, whose famdy, taking name from the place, wiU now form our proper subject. The vill of Rohale has already been mentioned in conjunction with Ashfield, under date of 1167.2 At the County Assizes of October, 1203, we learn that Ralph de Sanford had unjustly disseized Basdia de Rohal of her free tene ment in Rohal. Reseizin was ordered for Basilia, and Sanford ad judged to pay a merk damages, and a merk fine to the Crown. His sureties were Richard de Lake and Ralph Hose, of whom we shaU hear again.3 At the same Assizes Phdip de Rohal, aUeging that his brother John de Rohal had died seized of some part of a hide in Rothal, sued Ralph de Sanford as holding the same. Certain free men came into Court and showed that they held part of the premises, where upon Phdip explained that he did not sue for the premises except as they were held by Sanford ; that is, what Sanford was holding 1 Domesday, so. 259, a, 1. - Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 346-7. 3 Assizes, 5 John, memb. 4.

Hereupon Sanford particularized the tenure of William de Rohal, of whose service he said that John de Rohal had not died seized, for this very William (Philip I suppose is meant) had sometime brought a suit of mort d'ancestre (against Sanford, I presume) for the service of the said William and had taken nothing, nay, had been put in misericordid for the attempt. Moreover, said Sanford, John de Rohale never held any of the premises as his in heritance. The Jury however decided that the said John had died seized of the whole. Reseizin was ordered for Philip, and Sanford adjudged to be in misericordid. His Surety was Ralph Walsh (Wa lensis) .4 Again at these Assizes Alice, widow of Richard fitz Robert, sued Wdliam de Rohal (the tenant above mentioned) for her dower, viz. a third part of a virgate in Rohal, and, William not answering, she recovered it.5 In 1207 Philip de Rohall was amerced half a merk for some un specified offence.6 If I mistake not, some of these Litigants appear again at the Assizes of November, 1221, when Wdliam de Rohal, under the name of William fitz Robert, is sued as Tenant of two acres in Rohal, which Philip de Rohal claims as heir of John his deceased Brother. This Suit was accorded, Philip conceding the point for 2s.7 In another case, not concerning RuthaU, but already recited under Middleton Priors,8 I have only to notice how AUce, called widow of Richard de Rothal, in 1221, was identical with Alice, called widow of Richard fitz Robert, in 1203, and how in the interval she had remarried to Roger fitz Tropinel. At this period (1221) Ralph de Sanford was Tenant in capite of RuthaU, Philip de RohaU was his Feoffee, and had several Under Tenants there. Nothing in the above litigation can be taken to have disturbed this feudal ratio. On March 12, 1227, we have John de Rothale (son and heir I sup pose of Philip) attending the Prior of Wenlock's Court at Burton.9 I have already noticed the Inquest which in 1249 sat on the death of Richard de Sandford, son and successor of Ralph above 4 Assizes, 5 John, memb. 4 dorso.

John de Rothal again served as Munslow Juror at the Assizes of 1256 and 1272.

The name of Helgo was known in Normandy long before the Conquest, \u2014 known in that very region of the Oximiu which sent its Vicomte, Roger de Montgomery, to share in the spoils of Duke WiUiam's invasion.3 Helgot, perhaps a Scion of the house whose fortunes are told at length by Ordericus, was doubtless a Norman, and, as a FoUower of Roger de Montgomery, held nineteen Shropshire Manors under that Earl at the time of Domesday. Fixing his residence at Stan ton, he there founded that feudal Castle which once frowned sub jection on the upper Valley of the Corve. The spot seems to have been selected without reference to any other consideration than the will of the Founder. It presented no feature of natural strength. It was far from the Welsh Border, where every Fortress budt by the Normans was part of a system organized by the first Earl of Shrewsbury, and afterwards recognized and maintained by the Crown. But Helgot's Castle, however it may have disturbed the rich repose of Corve Dale, figures little on the page of History. The line of its Chieftains, though their sway may have been in rude contrast with the mild ride of the neighbouring Priory of St. Milburg, is hardly to be traced during the two Centuries which foUowed the Conquest. After that period had expired, not an acre of Helgot's Domesday Fief remained with his elder representatives. BARONY OF CASTLE HOLGATE. Helgot, the Founder of this house, was probably advanced in life at the time of Domesday. I have sometimes thought that Herbert, who is mentioned in that Record as the Under-tenant of Roger de Laci and of Helgot, was the eldest Son of the latter.4 I have reason to change this opinion. That Helgot's eldest son was named Herbert, aud that the said Herbert was of full age in 1086, has already appeared under Quatford. Helgot in that instance was surnamed \" De Stanton,\" a fact so consonant with Domesday as to need no explanation. All that I shall further say of Helgot is that his grant of Monk-moor to Shrewsbury Abbey must have passed after Domesday, but probably in the same century, and perhaps as a closing act in the Grantor's Use. I have, under Quat, stated my belief that Helgot left three Sons, each of them favoured by King Henry I. 3 Ordericus, p. 463. 4 Supra, Vol. I, p. 111.

Herbert fitz Helgot was the eldest, and of him, under that or some other name, I proceed to speak. He was one of the five Barons (for I can call them no less) who, between the years 1108 and 1113, were Assessors to King Henry I, and his Viceroy when the latter settled judiciaUy the right of Shrewsbury Abbey to a Morvdle Prebend.5 On October 17, 1109, a great Council of the realm was held at Nottingham. Its chief business was in regard to the recently created See of Ely, to which Hervey, late Bishop of Bangor, had been appointed. The King's Charter to Hervey, which must necessarily have passed shortly before the said Council, is preserved. The King was then a Guest of Herbert fitz Helgot, at whose Castle the do cument is dated.0 I have often spoken of the Great Court held by King Henry's Viceroy at Castle Helgot about a.d. 1115. It is very singular that among the influential laymen who were present Herbert fitz Helgot, though certainly living, does not demonstrably appear. But the third lay- witness of the Viceroy's Charter is written as \" Herbert de Clive\" (or \"de Cline\").7 He, I think, was identical with Her bert fitz Helgot, but to account satisfactorily for his being described as \"De Clive\" I am unable. Henry I's great Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey can be shown to have passed at Westminster about the end of May, 1121. It is at tested by constant attendants at Court asweU as by persons of local notoriety, amongst others by Herbert fitz Helgot. The latter had previously been a benefactor to the Abbey. He had given thereto his Manor of Norton (in Hales), and, what is more to our present purpose, he had given \" the Church of Stanton with all the tithes of himself and of his Knights, and with aU things which pertained to the same Church.\"8 It was apparently after the year 1121 that Murieldis, wife of Herbert fitz Helgot, added a carucate of land in Stanton to her husband's previous gifts to Shrewsbury Abbey. Certainly it was between the years 1121 and 1126 that Herbert and his whole family united in a formal act of confirmation to that House, which I must give as it is related in the Chartulary, \u2014 \" Herbert, son of Helgot, 8 Salop Chartulary, No. 35.

In 1156, the second year of Henry's reign, half of a debt of ten merks due to the Crown was made payable, by special bounty of the King, to Nicholas de Castello,15 \u2014 Brother, I presume, of the Lord of Holgate. In 1165 Herbert de Castello, like other Tenants in capite, having received the King's order to return a list of his Knights' -Fees, both old and new, does so, addressing the King as \" his most dear Lord,\" and bidding him \"health and faithful service.\" His return was of five Knights'-Fees, of old feoffment, and each of those Knights had done homage and allegiance to the King.16 At the same time Hugh de Laci as a Tenant in capite reported that Herebert de Castellis held under him two knights'-fees of new feoffment.17 These had been acquired certainly since the death of Henry I, probably therefore during the reign of Stephen, and whde Laci's Barony was an Escheat. I have before noticed how at the same period Herbert de Castello was associated with other Tenants of Laci's Fief.18 Such are the ph\u00e6nomena which, in default of further evidence, hardly suffice to indicate a fact, and if they only suggest an idea, enough has been said about them for the present. At Michaelmas 1171 Herbert de CasteUo had been associated with Engelard de Stratton as Visor of repairs at Shrawardine Castle ; in 1173 these CoUeagues had discharged a simdar duty at Shrews bury Castle ; and in 1174 a further memorandum of the latter service is entered on the Pipe Roll.19 In 1176 and 1177 he appears on another list, that namely of men whose fidelity to the Crown had not endured through a period of disturbance, but whose punishment purported to be for the overt act of forest-trespass. Herbert was fined by the King himself five merks in Herefordshire in 1176, and forty merks in Shropshire in 1177.19 Herbert de Castello died about the end ofthe year 1189, for the earliest fine during the fiscal year, which ended Michaelmas 1190, was that of his widow for her marriage.19 It was twenty merks, and probably exempted her from any second marriage to which she was not the Ancestor of Herbert de Cas teUo : had they so descended, they would have been of old feoffment. 15 Rot.

Before Michaelmas, 1193, she herself was deceased without issue, so that two Shropshire Baronies passed about the same period to collateral heirs. Of Emma de Pulverbatch and her succession I have spoken before, and it is no part of our present subject. The Heir to Herbert de Castello's Barony had to be sought amongst his kindred. The matter was unsettled, or a settlement thereof was still questioned ten years after his decease. The dis pute lay between that family of De Girros, of which I have so often spoken, and the descendants of one Richard de la Mare. Both De Girros and De la Mare, as connections of the House of Helgot, had held large Feoffinents in the Barony during the reign of Henry II, and before the Barony itself became vacant. It is remarkable that no knights' -service was reserved on either of their Tenures. De Girros' Fee was much the larger of the two ; nevertheless all evi dence favours the assumption that the posterity of Richard de la Mare were the nearest heirs to the Barony : of him and them I therefore proceed to speak. \u2014 Richard de la Mabe, who possibly married a Sister of Herbert de Castello, held Uffington under the said Herbert either in the reign of Stephen or early in that of Henry II. Before 1172 he made several grants in Uffington and Pimley to Haughmond Abbey, and in one or all of these he was joined by his son and presumptive heir, Robert. Robert de la Mare had succeeded his Father at Uffington before the year 1172, at least his attestation of a deed, which I shall hereafter quote under Eaton Mascott, implies as much. I have given a Charter under Beobridge of date about 1186 in which Robert de la Mare and Robert de Girros attest the act of Herbert de Castello. Their names, occurring in this order and under such circumstances, are illustrative, if not significant, of the genealogical fact which we are endeavouring to establish. Robert de la Mare is mentioned in other Charters of this period. He confirmed to Haughmond Abbey his Father's grants in Uffington and Pimley, of which I shall say more hereafter. I should now notice a Charter whereby he gave to that Abbey, with the body of Aliza his wife, the Mill of Bretham. The witnesses of this Deed were Walter Abbot of Lilleshall, Herbert de Castello and Robert de Girros,20 \u2014 20 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit. Bretham Mdl. IV. 8"], [506, "58 CASTLE HOLGATE. names which prove it to have passed between 1174 and 1190. Bretham I take to have been in Hampshire,21 and the Mill proba bly came to Robert de la Mare with his wife Aliza, but who she was I cannot say, nor is this the place to investigate so incidental a question. At the time of Herbert de Castello's death, Robert de la Mare had left or was leaving England, for I cannot but conclude that the Crusade in which he joined was that undertaken in 1188. Whether Robert de la Mare accompanied the English contingent in that year, or went under the banner of C\u0153ur de Lion in 1190, we do not know. More surely he was one of those who left Palestine in the Autumn of 1192, when Richard I abandoned the enterprise. The story of the King's homeward journey is well known. Robert de la Mare would seem to me to have taken the ordinary route, that is, to have sailed with the fleet which escorted the Queen safely to Sicily. He seems further to have landed in Italy, meditating, doubtless, an overland passage to England. Arriving at Benevento, he was there seized with mortal sickness, and his last act was to grant his whole vill of Uffington to the Abbey of Haughmond. This he did by giving investiture thereof, in trust, to Sir Alan de la Mare, his Cousin and companion, and by sealing a deed, in which the above particulars of his illness are recited, and which was at tested by the Preceptor and one of the Brethren of a House of Knights Hospitallers at Benevento.22 It may be presumed that the intelligence of Robert de la Mare's death reached England early in 1193. That may well be the date of a Roll of Fines, in which \"Agneta de la Mare\" is said to \"fine at the discretion of the Lord Chancellor,23 for her relief of the land which had belonged to her Father, Robert de la Mare, of whom she was the nearest heir.\"21 21 WdUam de WarbUnton, who was Lord of Shirfield, near Odiham, in Hamp shire, afterwards gave to Haughmond Ab bey a rent of 10s. in Shirfield, in exchange for Bretham Mid. The exchange is at tested by Thomas Mauduit, Robert Mau duit, and Walter de la Mare (Chartulary Tit. Shirefelde). It toot place in the first half of the thirteenth Century. Some very ancient but long-enduring connec tion between the famdies of Mauduit, De la Mare, and WarbUnton, is shown in other Counties and other instances, but the recital would be too fragmentary. 22 Chartulary, so. 217.

Most of the above particulars are furnished by the Deed in which, while still a Widow, she confirmed her late Father's bequest of Uffington to Haughmond Abbey. Richard I confirmed the gift of Robert de la Mare aud Agnes his daughter to Haughmond, on April 25, 1194, the King being then at Portsmouth.25 Before Michaelmas, 1194, Agnes de la Mare had remarried, to Ralph de Arderne, a Justiciar of that period, and sometime Sheriff of Herefordshire. It seems to be quite clear that in her right he had seizin of the Barony of Holgate, though he had not the ward ship of the two sons of Robert Mauduit, nor custody of the lands of which the latter had died seized in his own right. When, in 1194, the Scutage for King Richard's Redemption was levied in Shropshire at the rate of 20s. on each Knight's Fee, Ralph de Arden was assessed at 100*., \" scutage of the fees of Herbert de Castello,\" which, as we have seen, were five in number. Ralph de Arden had however quittance of the whole charge by special order of the King, \" because he was then with the King in the army of Normandy.\" 26 Agnes, the wife of Ralph de Ardern, was of a different mind to Agnes, the Widow of Robert Mauduit, in regard to her father's grant to Haughmond. However, by a fine, levied Feb. 14, 1195, she and her second husband quitted all claim to Uffington, receiving forty merks from the Abbot.27 In 1195 and 1197 Ralph de Ardene was again assessed by the Sheriff of Shropshire, to the second and third scutages of King Richard, and at 100s. in each instance.28 In 1199 I apprehend that Agnes de la Mare was deceased, for Hugh de Bosco, who was already Guardian of her son Thomas Mauduit, accounted in that year for the scutage assessed on the Barony of Holgate.28 It is now necessary to turn back and say something of the first husband of Agnes de la Mare. \u2014 Robert Mauduit, of Warminster, was doubtless a Cadet of that fortunate House, whose elder Representative for many generations ring Richard I's absence from England.

The elder House of Mauduit had many offshoots, and two at least of these minor branches attained at one time or other to some distinction. Warned by the errors, and much perplexed by the omissions of former Writers, I will venture to say but little of Robert Mauduit of Warininster ; and something of that little must be of a negative character. He was not then one of the four sons of William Mauduit, the Chamberlain, who died about the year 1170, and yet the eldest of those sons had the name of Robert, and having been Chamberlain to King Henry II, died before 1181, leaving no issue. His Successor was apparently his next Brother, William. In speaking therefore of Robert Mauduit, husband of Agnes de la Mare, I shall be careful to mention only that which must apply to him in clear distinction from his namesake and probable rela tion, \u2014 Robert Mauduit, the Chamberlain. It was, I suppose, the husband of Agnes de la Mare who, as we are told, was Sheriff of Wiltshire for the year ending Michaelmas, 1180, and thenceforward till Michaelmas, 1185, as also for the half-year ending Easter, 1187.29 About this time Robert Mauduit was Fermor of the Wilt shire Manors of Bretford and Cumbe, and an arrear (\u00a310. 6s. 7d.) on that account is charged against him at Michaelmas, 1189. At the latter period he was seized, by grant of the King, of the great Wiltshire Manor of Warminster, whose value to the Royal Exche quer was estimated at \u00a340. blanchP It appears by the Pipe Roll of the following year (1190) that this acquisition cost him a fine of \u00a3200. Of this, fine he had paid \u00a33. 2s. 4d. at the Exchequer, and, apparently, \u00a333. 6s. 8d. to the Chancellor (Longchamp).31 At Michaelmas, 1191, his debts are charged against him without allowing the above sum of \u00a333. 6s. 8d., or any further instalment, 29 This is the substance of Sir WiUiam Dugdale' s account of his Shrievalty (Ba ronage I, 399, b). Fuller's list of WUt shire Sheriifs would make Robert Malduit to have been Sheriff or Deputy from the year ending Michaelmas, 1181, to that ending Michaelmas, 1187. The combined aceoimts probably indicate the proximate truth as far as we need it here, and I have not thought it worth whde to consult the original Pipe-Rods on the point. I may however mention that neither EuUer nor Dugdale accurately understood the chro nological system of the Pipe-Rods. An tiquaries of the nineteenth century (e. g. Mr. Stapleton and Mr. Hunter) have eli minated the true theory. 30 Rot. Pip. 1 Ric. I, pp. 171, 178, Wdts. 31 Rot. Pip. 2 Ric.

Thus it ap pears that Herbert de Castello, Emma his wife, Robert de la Mare, aud Robert Mauduit, all died within a space of five years, and this circumstance naturally leads to some confusion in tbe Records of the period. Nevertheless the main facts are quite apparent. \u2014 Thomas Mauduit, the eldest son of Robert, was probably under ten years of age at his Father's death. In 1194 he was implcaded by William Revell, who claimed the Advowson of Warminster in right of his wife.32 After King Richard's return from captivity, and before Michael mas, 1195, Hugh de Hosco fined two hundred merks with the King for custody of the land, and marriage of the heirs, of Robert Mau duit, till they should be of age. His Sureties (twelve in number) were headed by Geoffrey fitz Piers and Earl Roger Bigot. He had paid fifty merks already to the Sheriff of Shropshire, and was to pay the balance to the Sheriff of Hampshire.33 About September, 1199, Hugh de Bosco compounds with the King (John) for the debts of himself and Robert Mauduit (deceased) . He will pay five hundred merks at fixed periods in lieu of five hun dred and thirty-eight merks stated to be due.3* The first scutage of King John was assessed in 1199 at two merks on each knight's fee. Only ten merks were charged in Shropshire on Hugh de Bosco and John de Kilpec, viz. on five fees of Herbert de Castello. This was inaccurate. \u2014 The fees intended to be assessed 32 Rot.

Again, two Writs- Close of Feb. 21 and 23, 1207, compute Robert Mauduit's original fine for Warminster at \u00a3200., of which he is said to have paid \u00a333. 6s. 8d. only in his lifetime, whereas he had paid that sum (fifty merks) to Longchamp, and \u00a33. 2s. 4d. besides. The Writs proceed to charge the supposed balance thus, \u2014 viz. \u00a366. 13*. -id. against Thomas Mauduit, the Heir, and \u00a3100. against Hugh de Bosco, who had bad cus tody of the said Heir. The Sheriff of Kent was further enjoined to compel payment by seizure of Hugh de Bosco' s lands (Claus. I, 78). It would seem then that Hugh de Bosco's fine of 1199 was nuga tory, and that the whole account had been re-opened. 33 Rot. Pip. 7 Ric. I, Salop. 34 Oblata, pp. 27, 28. Hugh de Bosco was at this time Sheriff of Hampshire, and had many other ferms under the Crown, so that it is difficult to say how this debt of five hundred and thirty-eight merks arose. Robert Mauduit's debt, when properly balanced, was \u00a3173. 17s. 7d., or about two hundred and sixty-one merks : but to show how very unsystematicaUy these accounts were kept, I should state that on the ChanceUor's RoU of 1201, Hugh de Bosco is not only charged with his fine of five hundred merks, but with two debts of Robert Mauduit,\u2014 both er-"], [510, "62 CASTLE HOLGATE. were those of Castle Holgate and Pulverbatch collectively, and were at least six in number, whereof five were Holgate fees. Neverthe less Hugh de Bosco profited by the confusion, paid only six merks where he ought to have paid ten, and left two merks charged against himself and Kilpec jointly. Kilpec paid two merks.35 In October, 1199, Thomas Mauduit is set down as suing Robert de Giros for land in La Clie (Clee St. Margaret) . Also Robert de Giros essoigns himself in a \" plea of appeal,\" where Thomas Mau duit and Hugh de Bosco appear, intelligibly enough, as joint prose cutors.36 Both causes were adjourned to November, and then Hugo de Bosco and Robert de Girros are mentioned as parties to two suits, viz. of novel disseizin and of injury inflicted (injuri\u00e6 illat\u00e6), which, at request of the said parties, were adjourned to Easter Term, 1200.37 I hear nothing more of either of these suits, but in April, 1200, an old Charter of Herbert de Castello and his wife Emma was exhi bited as evidence in another suit by the Master of the Knights Templars, but the cause could not progress because the \" lands of said Herbert and Emma were in the King's hand, and there was contention between the heirs, and so the Master knew not whom he could call to warranty of the said Charter.\"38 At Michaelmas, 1201, Hugh de Bosco is entered on the Wiltshire Pipe-Roll as holding \" Warminster and its Hundred with the heir of Robert Mauduit,\" that is, as part of the said heir's inheritance. At the same time Hugh de Bosco has quittance, under Writ Royal, for the second scutage of King John assessed on the Tenants in capite of Shropshire.39 He was similarly acquitted of King John's third scutage, levied in 1202 ; but on the list of the fourth scutage, in 1203, his name only appears, without any charge annexed or any note of payment or acquittance. About this time Thomas Mauduit came of age, for on the fifth, sixth, and seventh scutages of John, levied respectively in 1204, 1205, and 1206, he stands acquitted by name in regard of his Shrop shire Fief.

In 1210 both accompanied King John to Ireland ; and we learn from the Pr\u00e6stita-Roll of that year, how the King accommodated Mauduit with several loans of three or four merks at Pembroke, Carrickfergus, and Dublin, in June, July, and August.41 A Shropshire Feodary of the year 1211 perpetuates the confusion between the Fiefs of Castle Holgate and Pulverbatch, saying that Thomas Mauduit, Baron, and William de Cantilupe hold them in capite and owe the service of five knights;42 whereas such service was due on the Castle-Holgate Barony singly. The Scutage of Poitou, assessed in 1214 at the rate of three merks (\u00a32.) per fee, is more accurate as regards Mauduit's Shropshire Barony. He is expressly said \" to owe \u00a310. for the Fee3 which had been Herbert de Castello's.\" It is added, that subsequent to the assessment he had quittance by a Writ Royal.43 The reason is ap parent from another Record.

Nor did Mau duit return to his allegiance on the accession of Henry III, for on March 16, 1217, all his lands in Shropshire, Hampshire, and other Bailiwicks are given to Robert de Ferrars, wherewith to support him self in the King's service, and during the King's pleasure ; but on the 23rd July following, reference being made to the Rolls of King John, it was found that Warminster had beeu previously granted to Ralph Gernun, and to him the Sheriff of Wiltshire was ordered to give seizin thereof.45 On Sept. 14, 1217, Thomas Mauduit, having returned to his alle giance, is reinstated in his possessions.46 In 1218 he is assessed to the first scutage of Henry III, namely ten merks on five fees for merly Herbert de Castello's.

So also in 1230 was he acquitted of the Scutage of Brittany, and had letters of protection dated April 20, at Portsmouth, for so long as he should be over sea with the King.53 Again, in 1231 he had exemption from the Scutage of Poitou. In 1231-2 he had a grant of Free- Warren for his Wiltshire Manor of Warminster.53 In 1232 his five Shropshire Fees are discharged of the Scutage of Elvin. In September, 1235, and Easter, 1236, Thomas Mauduit, of Castle Holgate, paid by the hand of Robert de Aula, Seneschal of Castle Holgate, his quota of the aid then levied on marriage of the King's Sister. He was assessed, be it observed, on five and a quarter fees of old feoffment, and he paid accordingly ten and a half merks.54 About the year 1240 we have three nearly cotemporary, but dis cordant, statements as to the Fees of Thomas Mauduifs Barony.55 Each list specifies in effect the five tenures which constituted the Barony in 1165, but one of the component fees (Bouldon) is reduced by the fourth part of a Knight's Fee. Also in addition to the Fees of 1165, we have in these lists the tenure of Wilham de Castle Hol gate variously estimated at a whole fee and at half a fee ; and one list adds Belswardine as held by service of half a fee. The general conclusion is that the services due to the Barony had increased since 1165 in consequence of more recent feoffments, but this net increase was variously stated at one-fourth or at three-fourths of a Knight's Fee. 47 Rot.

Thomas Mauduit, being, I suppose, little short of sixty years of age, excused himself from the unfortunate expedition which, in 1242, Henry III conducted into France. His absence was purchased by a Fine of \u00a380. over and above his Scutage.56 And shortly after this he died, being succeeded, as one Record suggests,57 first by his son Robert, secondly by his son Thomas, and thirdly by his son William, whose two elder Brothers had died without issue. The Fine and Originalia Rolls make no mention of the two elder sons, Robert and Thomas, but treat William Mauduit's succession as immediate to his Father, Thomas. The King took William's homage on June 10, 1244, and ordered the Sheriffs of Shropshire, Hampshire, and Wilt shire to give him seizin of his inheritance in those Counties.58 I shall have other opportunities of noticing certain grants of Thomas Mauduit to Shrewsbury and Haughmond Abbeys. He seems to have been buried at Haughmond, for by his last Will and Testament he bequeathed, with his body, to the Canons of that House, 20s. rent arising out of his Mill of Castle Holgate, where with the Canons were to celebrate his anniversary . His Executors, Nicholas de Haversham, Cecilia Mauduit, and John, Rector of the Church of Dene, certified this grant,59 which was soon followed up and increased by a Charter of \u2014 William Mauduit, who, styling himself \" Lord of Castle Hol gate,\" grants to the Canons the whole of the said Mill, its appur tenances and suits, and all facilities for repairing the same; also the messuage and land which Gilbert, the Miller, held in the time of his Father.60 He further, hy letters-patent, informs Robert de Bouldon, Constable of Castle Holgate, of this Grant, and directs him accordingly; and the Constable acknowledges the receipt of his Lord's Mandate in an instrument dated a.d. 1248. In 1245 the Aid for marriage of the King's Daughter was as sessed at 100s., or \u00a31. on each of the five reputed fees of this Barony.61 In 1246 the Scutage of Gannok was assessed on five fees of this Barony, but the assessment was excused by Writ Royal.62 Peter de Say, Sir John de Muklenee, Sir EUas de la Mare, Peter de Dudemoneston, Richard de MideUiope, Robert de Gyros, John Mauduit, John, Parson of Dene, etc. 56 Dugdale's Baronage, I, 399, quoting Rot.

On Nov. 8, 1253, the King being at St. Machary, in Gascony, granted to William Mauduit, of Warminster (who was doubtless there also), a yearly Fair at Warminster, and a weekly Market on Thursdays at \" Castle Holegod.\"03 In 1254 William Mauduit was returned as one of those who held lands of \u00a320. annual value and upwards in the Counties of Salop and Stafford. In the same year his Barony was assessed at five Fees to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward.04 In 1255 the Munslow Jurors reported that William Mauduit was holding Castle Holegod, with its appurtenances, of the King. It was reputed to be five hides, and so had not varied from the Domesday measurement of the two Stantons which constituted the Manor. \" William Mauduit had a Franchise,\" said these Jurors : \" he did suit to the County, but not the Hundred, nor did he pay stretward nor motfee :\"65 his Franchise is elsewhere particularized. He had gallows, held pleas of bloodshed, and hue and cry ; had assize of beer, and was entitled (for all causes within his liberty) to a Writ of Right, i. e. to a Writ-Close empowering him to try them in his own Court.65 It was at the County Assizes of January, 1256, that William Mauduit, having a suit about Oxenbold with the Prior of Wenlock, alleged his title to have descended as follows, viz. from Robert de la Mare, living in the time of Henry II, to Agnes, his daughter and beir; from Agnes to Thomas, her son and heir; from Thomas to Robert and Thomas his sons, who died successively without issue ; from them to William, their Brother, the present Plaintiff.66 It was apparently within the next two years that William Mau duit alienated Castle Holgate, and indeed all his Shropshire Barony, to Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall, Brother of King Henry III, better known by his foreign titles of \" King of Almagne \" or \" King of the Romans.\" Though the Baronial House of Mauduit now vanished from Shropshire History,67 I imagine that the line continued elsewhere for many generations.68 But adhering to our proper subject and ra Rot.

What was the precise nature of this con veyance I cannot learn from any specific document : its general character is apparent from the results. In 1260, when the Scutage of Wales was assessed at \u00a32. per fee on the Tenants in capite of Shropshire, among those who had quittance by Writ-Royal was the \" King of Almagne, in respect of five fees of Thomas Mauduit.\" A parenthetical note implies that the Master of the Templars pro fited by, or was the person concerned in, this quittance.69 In 1274 the Jurors of Munslow Hundred reported ho^) William Mauduit once held the Manor of Castle Holegod of the KingVra capite, by Barony ; how he alienated it to the King of Almagne, by whose subsequent concession the Templars were then holding it. They further reported how the King of Almagne had withdrawn the suit of Bouldon, Allaunston, Stevinton, and Esfeld from Muns low Hundred.70 The Vills in question (except Ashfield, of which I have spoken before) are known to have been members of the Barony of Holgate. Similar complaints were made in other Hundreds as to Holgate Fees, whose Suits had been attracted to the Castle. Another presentment of the Munslow Jurors was that the Tem plars at Castle Holegod had held trial in cases of unjust distress71 for eighteen years past. This proves the date of their introduction to the Barony as about 1256. The franchise thus exercised by them seems to have belonged rather to their Order than to the Fief of which they happened to be seized. The prestige and influence of the Templars was at this period (1274) on the decline. There were symptoms of that decay which early in the next century rendered their total suppression an easy task. Powerless, as it would seem, to redress their own injuries, an aggravated insult offered to their Order was reported by the same Munslow Jurors whom I have quoted above. \u2014 \" As the bailiffs of the Templars of Castle Holegod were conveying six quarters of oats to wards Ludlow, and were passing near Corfham, there came John, in August, 1270, being about to accom pany Prince Edward to Palestine, has license to put out at ferm his demesnes of Warminster (Pat. 54 Hen.

They then conveyed the oats on to some demesne-land of their Lord, and there and then sowed the same, harrowing the ground with the said horses.\" \u2014 Sir John Gifford of Corfham Castle was, as we know from other sources, a man of the most unscrupulous violence ; but go back fifty years, and a company of such Barons would hardly have ventured thus to insult a College of Knights Templars. Richard Plantagenet, King of the Romans, dying in 1272, was succeeded in the Earldom of Cornwall by his Sou Edmund. A docu ment of the year 1276 shows the Master of the Templars paying to the said Earl Edmund a certain Ferm for the Barony of Holgate.72 I do not know that an otherwise inaccurate Inquisition of Feb. 1, 1283, which I have before quoted,73 and which connects the Master of the Templars with the Honour of Castle Holgate, is good evi dence that the Templars' tenure was still existent. The Feodary of 1284 shows Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and Wells, holding the Manor of Castle Holgate of Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, by ser vice of three Knights'-Fees ; the Earl holding of the King.74 We know from the same and from other Records that this alleged Tenure of the Manor of Holgate involved a Seigneury over all the Fees which constituted the Barony. This then was the greatest of Bishop Burnell' s great acquisitions. Castle Holgate may be considered as the Caput of the whole Honour which he left to his Heirs, and which made them Barons of the Realm. This revolution in Shropshire Tenures was of a new kind. It was not brought about by the previous forfeiture of the Barojfe of Holgate. It was not founded on any remote claim of he reditary right.75 It was the supremacy of genius asserting its place against the laws and prejudices of Feudalism, \u2014 laws as yet only par tially relaxed, prejudices hardly yet shaken.

I now proceed to quote the Inquisition which, after the death of Bishop Burnell, took account of his Manor at Holgate. \u2014 In the first place, his tenure of Castle Holgate was a tenure in capite, that is, the Earl of Cornwall's mediate interest had been done away with ; in the next place, it was held by service of two Knights (not three as before), in time of war, at Montgomery. The Capital Messuage and garden were valued at half a merk per annum ; the Old Castle could not be valued because it yielded nothing. A Dove-House, worth 40d., three carucates of demesne, worth \u00a36., six acres of meadow, worth 12s., a private (separalis) pasture, worth 2s., five acres of wood, worth 12d. per annum, the rents of Free Tenants yielding \u00a31. 17s. 4d., the rents of Customary Tenants and Cottars yielding \u00a35. 9s. 4\\d., the Pleas and Perquisites of Court yield ing \u00a33., and a Water Mill (held of Roger de Bradeleye) yielding \u00a32. per annum ; \u2014 these were the constituents of the Manor of Hol gate.76 Philip Burnell, Nephew and Heir of the Bishop, died in 1294. The Inquest on his death limits the service due to the Crown on Castle Holgate to that of two horsemen (homines equitantes) , who were to serve at Montgomery for forty days. Another Inquest shows that at the time of his decease half his Manor of Holgate was in the hands of certain Merchants of Lucca, whose claims on his estate shall be more fully set forth under Abdon.77 I quit this subject merely remarking that on the death of Edward Burnell, in 1315, Castle Holgate was stated to be held of the King's Honour of Mont gomery Castle, but by service of finding a single serving horseman for forty days at the Castle of Montgomery, in time of war.78 Of the Undeb-Tenants at Holgate I can say very little. Proba bly the estate was held chiefly in Demesne by the Lords of the Fee, whether Barons or Templars. William fitz John, whom I have spoken of as their Tenant at The Heath, was probably identical with that William de Castro Holegod who is stated to hold either a whole or half-fee in Castle Holegod about 1240. 79 His Tenure was perhaps both here and at The Heath, but the latter, it should be re membered, could not with strictness be reckoned as a member of 7s Inquisitions, 9 Edw.

The Abbot of Haughmond was, as we have seen, a Tenant in Holgate Manor, under the bequest of Thomas Mauduit and the grant of William Mauduit. The Mill and tenement which he thus acquired lay probably near Brookhampton. The Chartulary of Haughmond supplies two subsequent transactions affecting this tenancy. About 1260, Henry le Perer, of Castle Holgate, quit claims to the Abbey .half an acre of meadow in the vill of Castle Holgate, near the Mill.80 On Nov. 23, 1348, John Abbot, of Haughmond, demises to Sara, Widow of William Baghil, of Broke hampton, and Sir William, her son, Chaplain, for their lives, a mes suage in Brokehampton, with a meadow and three acres of land ; \u2014 at a rent of 3s. per annum?1 In January, 1271, Richard Langefote was suing John Albard for a tenement in \" Holgodes-Castel,\" under Writ of novel disseizin.82 HOLGATE CHURCH. The Church and the Priest which belonged to Helgot's Domesday Manor of Stanton, seem to me not to have been placed there by himself, but rather to have been the remains of a Saxon Founda tion. His son Herbert, as we have seen, granted the Church to Shrewsbury Abbey in the time of Henry I, and before the year 1121. Between that year and August 1127, the said Herbert ap peared in the Chapter House of Hereford, and there, in presence of Richard (de Capella) the Bishop, he and his son Eutropius con ceded, that is, formally allowed the previous gift.83 The Church was at this period still called the Church of Staunton. About the year 1138, Robert de Betun, Bishop of Hereford, calls it the Church of Castle Helegot, and confirms the Abbey of Shrewsbury in its right of receiving an annual pension of 8s. 8d. out of the same.84 80 Fo. 114.

It does not appear whether this Church was Portionary from the first, or how it became so. The following Deed and Fine, one, and probably both, of which passed in 1210, exhibit the Church as al ready held by three Portionists or Prebendaries. These were after wards known as the Presbyteral, the Diaconal, and the Subdiaconal Prebends. The Advowson of the first and third pertained to Salop Abbey, the Lords of Holgate presented to the second. By a Char ter, preserved in the Salop Chartulary, Thomas Mauduit quit-claims to the Abbey two Prebends in this Church, viz. those which Helias and Osbern, Priests, held by presentation of the said Abbey.85 A Fine levied at Northampton, before the King himself, in November, 1210, is more explicit. It purports to be between Thomas Mau duit, Plaintiff (by his Attorney, William fitz Warin), and Hugh, Abbot of Salop, Tenant (by WilUam, a Monk, his Attorney), con cerning the Advowson of a third of the Church of Castle Holegot, whereof recognition of darrein presentment was summoned, etc. The Abbot acknowledged the said third to be the right of the Plaintiff, so that he and his Heirs shall present a fitting Clerk for the same to the Abbot and his Successors, who in turn should pre sent the said Clerk to the Diocesan Bishop : \u2014 Saving to the Abbot and his Successors the pension due of old. For this acknowledg ment Mauduit quit-claimed, for himself and heirs, to the Abbey, all right in the Advowson of the other two parts of the said Church.86 On August 23, 1280, John de Peckham, Archbishop of Canter bury, having inspected the Charters of Shrewsbury Abbey, con firmed (inter alia) its title to a pension of 8s. 8d., receivable from the Church of Castle Helgod.87 Soon after this, the Patronage of Tugford Church, and of two of the Holgate Prebends, passed from Shrewsbury Abbey to the See of Hereford. How this happened I will not here attempt to state, for the transfer seems to have been but a part of more extensive transactions to which I shall have other opportunities of referring. How all the three Prebends came to be eventually consolidated in a single Rectory I cannot declare. In the Taxation of 1291, the three portions in this Church are valued separately ; the first at \u00a36., the other two at \u00a34. 6s. 8d. each.88 Consistently with this, the Taxation of the Parish in 1341 quotes the Church Taxation at twenty-two merks (\u00a314. 13s. 4d.) : 85 No. 295.\u2014 Attested by Robert Mau duit, Robert de Giraus, Vivian de RosaU, Walter de Mara, WiUiam, Clerk of Gretel, WiUiam, Clerk of Baschirch, WiUiam de Tongelond, Richard Osdar. 86 Pedes Finium, 12 John, Salop. 87 Salop Chartulary, No. 62. 88 Pope Nich.

The reasons were, because sheep and lambs were not in the stock of the Parish ; because the small tithes, offerings, and glebe went to increase the Church Taxation, and were not to be reckoned for the Ninth ; and because four acres of land, assessable to the Ninth, lay uncultivated.89 In 1534 the Rectory of Holgott, in the Deanery of Wenlock and Diocese of Hereford, was enjoyed by Edward Strete, Rector. His preferment, in glebe and tithes, together with a pension of 4s. re ceivable from the Rector of Aston Botterell, was valued at \u00a313. 7s. 4d. per annum.

Now it is worth 10s.\"1 This is one of the places which took its name from the Great Clee Hill. The addition of \" St. Margaret,\" to distinguish it from other Clees, probably arose from the Church having been dedicated to that Saint. If I have rightly identified Herbert fitz Helgot with him who occurs about 1115 as Herbert de Clive (or Cline), his possession of this Manor and other property in the vicinity of the Clee Hill, may perhaps account for his being thus named.2 The gradual dismemberment of this Manor by the Lords of Hol gate can be traced with precision, though many of the circumstances are buried in oblivion. The first who occurs as holding it of those Barons was Agnes Banastre, after whose death it reverted to the Seignoral Lords, 1 Domesday, so. 258, b, 1.

MARGARET. though Robert de Girros claimed it, and perhaps for a time en joyed it. Who Agnes Banastre was is a question on which I may have more to say hereafter. Suffice it here to say, suggestively, that the second lay- witness in the Chapter of 1115, at Castle Holgate, was Richard Banastre, the third Herbert de Cline, as already stated. Further, at a period so remote as that the Munslow Jurors of 1255 could not recall it, Agnes Banastre gave a virgate in Clee St. Mar garet to Wenlock Priory. That Agnes Banastre was a near relation of the Lords of Holgate I cannot doubt ; that she was identical with Agnes who died seized of Clee St. Margaret in or shortly before the year 1199, is also I think plain. If so, she was Aunt (amita) of Robert de Girros (II), but it does not appear that he claimed Clee St. Margaret as her heir, but as his own by some other hereditary title. During the reign of Richard I, the male line of the Lords of Holgate failed, and the Barony fell into the King's hands by reason of the minority of the heir. At the same time Robert de Girros (II), by far the greatest Feoffee in that Barony, was in minority also, and the lands of his Fief were in the Escheator's hands, be cause the Barony itself under which he held was in the Crown. It was between June and September, 1199, that Robert de Girros (then of age) fined twenty merks with King John, to \" have seizin of the land of Clie, which was his right and inheritance, and which was seized into the hands of the King because Agnes, his (Robert's) Aunt, died therein.\"3 Of this Fine Robert de Girros paid instal ments in 1200, 1201, and 1203, but still owed eleven merks four shillings, a debt which I do not find further liquidated. Meantime he appears to have entered on Clee St. Margaret, disseizing Thomas Mauduit and his Guardian, Hugh de Bosco, who probably claimed the same as Representatives of Agnes. Hence arose the Suits of Novel Disseizin and Injury inflicted, in which Mauduit and his Guardian were suing Robert de Girros in October and November, 11 99.* These suits, as I have already said, I can trace no further. It is certain however that Mauduit eventually recovered Clee St. Margaret ; and perhaps the discontinuance of De Gfrros' payments on his Fine for this Manor, indicate a cotemporary defeat of his object. About the year 1210 Thomas Mauduit grants to Salop Abbey the homage of Henry fitz Sweyn and half a virgate in the vill of Clia, 3 Rot. Pip. 1 John, Salop.

Witnesses : Robert Mauduit, Robert de Girros, etc.5 The next alienation which Thomas Mauduit made in Clee St. Margaret was of a virgate, given to Haughmond Abbey for the souls' health of himself, his wife Agnes, and his brother William : half of it was of his demesne, the other half held by Henry fitz Pagan.6 About 1250, one Philip, a Chaplain, evidently a Tenant of Wil liam Mauduit here, gave three nocates of land to the Knights Hospitallers of Dinmore (Herefordshire). Thus in 1255, Nicholas Andreu, otherwise called Nicholas Fitz Andrew, of Ludlow, was William Mauduit's sole remaining Tenant here. His tenure was a quarter of a hide ; he did suit to William Mauduit's Court of Castle Holgate, and paid 3d. per annum for stretward and motfee. The Jurors of Munslow Hundred, of whom he was one, reported this Tenure, as well as all the previous alienations from the Manor.7 It will be observed that, taking tbe nocate to be the fourth part of a virgate, the aggregate contents of the Manor accounted for by these Jurors were 4_f virgates ; \u2014 an increase, if anything, on the single hide of Domesday. Nicholas Andreu was again a Munslow Juror at the Assizes of 1256. The Seigneury of Clee St. Margaret passed with the Barony of Holgate to the King of Almagne. Hence in 1284, Master William Ondreu (Andrew) is said to hold the vill of Clya St. Margaret of Blakeway himself requires correction. He was Uving Nov. 3, 1218, but dead in 1221, having ruled his Abbey about thirty years. 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 13. \u2014 The Mun slow Jurors of 1255 made great mistakes about this grant. They thought it to have passed about 1225, and in the time of Abbot Henry of Shrewsbury (who suc ceeded August 24, 1223). They further described the grant as a sale by Thomas Mauduit for 4s. annual rent. (Vide Rot. Bund. II, 71.)\u2014 But the date of Thomas Mauduit's Charter is proved to have been about 1210 in another way. Its eight witnesses are exactly identical with the eight who attested his Charter about the Prebends of Holgate Church, and the latter Charter we know to have passed about 1210. (Vide supra, p. 71, note 85.) Now Mr. Blakeway (Eist. Shrewsbury, II, 109) proves that this grant was in or before the time of Abbot Hugh, who set apart several sums of money wherewith his Convent should celebrate Ids anniver sary ; and, among other such sums, was a rent of 5s., receivable from Che, \" which 5s. rent Thomas Mauduit gave to the Abbey.\" (Salop Chartulary, No. 379.)

Dismissing all further account of the Seigneury, I proceed to ob serve that Master William Andreu, the Tenant, was living in 1292, that he had had an Under-Tenant here, on whose death William de Middelhope entered upon the Tenement of the said Under-Tenant, claiming to be his Landlord. William Andrew, accompanied by John Mile and William de Stapleton, hereupon endeavoured to gain an entry into the said tenement, but failing to do so, William de Stapleton set the house on fire. William de Stapleton was dead when this matter came before the Justices in Eyre at the County Assizes of October, 1292. Then William Andrew and his surviving companions, being put upon their trial, pleaded that they were Clerks. As such the Archdeacon of Salop, on behalf of the Bishop of Lichfield, demanded their persons to be given up to him, and this apparently was done.9 1 shall speak of William Andrew and his family more particularly hereafter. I add here a few further facts relating to the different Tenures in Clee St. Margaret. \u2014 Haughmond Fee. \u2014 The Abbot is said to have sold his virgate about 1225 to Henry Latewis for an annual rent of 7s?\u00b0 & feoff ment or lease is probably indicated ; for the Haughmond Chartulary exhibits the Abbot as leasing half a virgate here in 1445 at a rent of 5s. : and in 1541-2, two rents of 8s. and Is. in Clive St. Margaret are among the assets of the dissolved Monastery of Haughmond.11 Wenlock Fee. \u2014 From various Rent- Rolls of the Priory, I find that 6s. 8d. of the rent of the Mill of Clee St. Margaret went in 1495-6 to the Convent Kitchen. The Sacristan had also 3s. 8d. rent in the Clee, 2s. whereof seems to have arisen from the same Mill. In 13 Hen.

It only remains therefore to say that which I have found relative to another Tenure in the Manor. \u2014 In 1251, Richard Seward had sued Thomas Seward under writ of novel disseizin for a tenement in Le Cle.11 At the County Assizes, January, 1256, these two Brothers, sons of Robert Syward, had a suit still pending concerning a tenement in the vill of St. Margaret de Clyes, but Richard, the Plaintiff, failed to prosecute it. His Sureties were William fitz Clerk of The Heath, and Richard Cunseil of the same.15 THE CHURCH OF CLEE ST. MARGARET. The first notice which I can suppose to relate to this Church is in the Taxation of 1291, where it is entered in the Deanery of Ludlow as the Church of \" La Cleye St. Milburge,\" and is said to belong to the Hospitallers of Dinmore, but its value is not specified.16 In the Assessment to the Ninth, of 1341, this Parish has no mention either in the Deanery of Ludlow or elsewhere. But in the Valor of 1534-5, \"the Chapel of St. Margaret de Lee Clee\" is distinctly noticed in the Deanery of Ludlow. Its Value in Corn and Hay- Tithes was \u00a33. per annum, out of which a pension of 14s. was an nually payable to the Commander of the Commandery of St. John of Dynmore?7 No Incumbents are mentioned in the Hereford Registers pre vious to the Dissolution, and the first of whom I hear is \u2014 Richard Rushton, Parson of this Church in 38 Hen.

I am not proposing to offer, under any Manor of Patinton Hun dred, a detailed account of this succession of Sheriffs ; but the his tory of Tugford supplies an early and positive fact to that future and more important subject. Domesday notices Tugford thus : \u2014 \"The same Rainald (the Sheriff) hath given Dodefort to the Church of St. Peter, for the soul of Warin his Antecessor. Eluuin held it (in Saxon times) and was free, together with the land. Here are three and a half hides.

(in Saxon times) : now it is worth 40s. (per annum). Of this land Rayner holds i hide of Rainald. Here he has i ox team and i neatherd, hi Villains and i Boor with i team. Its value is 8s.\"1 This requires some comment.- \u2014 It was Warin himself, the first Sheriff of Shropshire, who gave to Shrewsbury Abbey whatever it had at Tugford, viz. two and a half out of the three and a half hides of which the Manor consisted. Warin died before Domesday, and Rainald, marrying his Widow, succeeded him as Sheriff. Hence Domesday calls Warin the Antecessor of Rainald, i. e. his predeces sor in office and estate. The assertion that Rainald gave Dodefort to Salop Abbey, must be construed to mean that he executed the previous gift (perhaps incomplete, perhaps testamentary) of Warin. The hide in Tugford, which neither Warin or Rainald gave to the Abbey, continued to be held in fee under their Successors. It was Thonglands. There are six imperial Charters of general confirmation to Shrews bury Abbey, if we include that of the first Palatine Earl. Each of these mentions the grant in Tugford, and ascribes it to \" Warin the Sheriff;\" each of these calls Rainald Warm's Brother, by which is meant only Brother -in- Law. Earl Roger's Charter describes Warm's grant as that of the vill of Tugford, with its appendages; the Charters of King William, Henry I, and Stephen, limit it to two hides in Tugford ; but those of Henry II and Henry III say most accurately that it was two and a half hides. In 1180, Hemming and Ralph, two residents in Tuggefort, are charged 12d. for an embladement of one acre, by the Justices of the Forest. Reginald de Tugford and his Brother William, a Chaplain, occur between 1222 and 1234.2 About this time Roger Borde con- Domesday, so. 254, a, 2. | 2 Supra, Vol. I, p. 210."], [533, "81 TUGFORD. cedes for one merk to Salop Abbey all his right to half a virgate in Bellecote (Baucot near Tugford), which William Carpenter held.

Henry de Ticheford renounced his claim, whereupon the Abbot conceded him a life-lease of the pre mises at a rent of 2s. 6d., and for six merks paid down.4 In 1255, the Munslow Jurors found that the \" Abbot of Salop held the Manor of Tugford, with its appurtenances, for five hides. He had a franchise there, and did no Suit either to County or Hun dred, nor paid stretward nor motfee .* his Franchises are particu larized. He held pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry, he assized beer, and could make return to a Writ de recto for any cause arising within his bberty, but he had not Gallows.\"5 Here we notice that the hidage of Tugford is reported as just double the original grant of Warin. I suppose Thonglands (one hide) to be included in the estimate, and perhaps that Manor owed \u00a3wi/-of-Court to Tugford rather than to Munslow Hundred. The proximity of Broadstone, Holgate, Abdon, a place called Fertecote, and Cold Weston, in all of which the Abbey had acquired lands independently of Warm's grant in Tugford, may account for the remaining increase. The Abbot's Charter of Free Warren, dated May 21, 1256, in cludes Tugford.6 At the County Assizes of 1272, the Abbot of Salop sued John de Wodewale, Walter de Hull, Richard le Carpenter, William Wise, Richard de la Hall, Isabella de Baggesore, and others, to constrain them to do Suit to his Court of Magna Tugford, alleging that Ab bot WiUiam, his predecessor, was seized of such Suits : all agreed to perform the required service, or were sentenced so to do.7 Again, Richard le Carpenter having commenced a suit against Abbot Luke, claiming to be allowed common-pasture in Ballecote, failed to prose cute : he claimed the said right, as appurtenant to his own tene ment in Thonglands.7 Richard de Balcote was on the Munslow Jury at these Assizes.

The Constable had also entered the Abbot's Grange at Tugford, and carried thence to Corfham ten trusses of hay.9 The Feodary of 1284 mentions the Abbot of Shrewsbury's tenure of Tugford in capite.

The pension is included in Archbishop Peckham's Confirmation of 1280.16 The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Tugeford, in Wenlock Deanery, at \u00a35. 6s. 8d., besides the Abbot of Shrewsbury's portion of 2s. arising therefrom.17 In 1301, if not earlier, the Bishop of Hereford was Patron of this Church, as I have noticed under Holgate. The Parochial Assessment of 1341 quotes the Church Taxation correctly at eight merks two shillings (\u00a35. 8s. 8c?.) ; but the Com missioners taxed the Parish only at 30s. for the Ninth oi its wheat, wool, and lamb. The reasons were that the glebe-land, valued at \u00a31. 6s. 8c?., the alter ages, valued at \u00a32., and the hay-tithes, worth 10s. per annum, were all reckoned in the Church Taxation, but could not be estimated as regarded the Ninth. Moreover the Te nants, under stress of poverty, were not tilling the land, and six of them were Mendicants. It seems alsp that there was no tithe of wool or lamb in the parish.18 It would appear from this that the Parish, instead of being taxed 30s. to the Ninth, should not have been taxed at all ; \u2014 for the Church Taxation, all but 2s., was made up of items not calculable in the present assessment, to say nothing of the other causes of insolvency.

It is very singular, and I have before alluded to the fact, that King Wd liam's Charter to Salop Abbey mentions Tugford first as an original possession of the Church of St. Gregory, and then as a gift by Warin the Sheriff.

Because it happened that the tithes of demesne and the other corn-tithes were the Abbot's, they had never been reckoned in the Church Taxation, and so, if that Taxation had ac tually been adhered to as a basis in this instance, the Ninth of Tugford would have been nothing. The Commissioners (fairly enough) assessed, not that value which was indicated by the Church Taxation, but that which was excepted. In 1534 the preferment of Ralph Blakemore, Rector of Tugford, was (in glebe, tithes, and offerings) \u00a34. 13s. 4c?., which sum was chargeable with 7s. 2c?. for Synodals and Procurations.19 I find no notice either of tithes or pension among the cotemporary receipts of Salop Abbey. EARLY INCUMBENTS.20 John de Mosewell, Clerk, resigned Tugford, Oct. 9, 1291, on the ground of ill health. The Bishop of Hereford assigns him a pension of 20s. out of the Benefice, payable to him yearly, on St. Luke's day, in the Church of St. Magnus the Martyr, London.

It was probably near to both, but the name is now lost. Perhaps the place was that afterwards known as Ballecot or Baucott, but the etymological change is a great one.

It was between the years 1107 and 1113, probably in 1109, that Abbot Fulchered, proving his original agreement with Rayner, ob tained restitution of Fertecote by judgment of a Court which, if it was not presided over by Henry I himself, as the Charter implies, was attended by Richard, Bishop of London, Alan fitz Flaald, Hamo Peverel, Roger and Robert Corbet, and Herbert fitz Hel got.28 William fitz Reyner, thus losing Fertecote, transmitted Thonglands to his descendants, as held under Alan fitz Flaald, just mentioned, and his successors, the Fitz Alans. Hence, in 1165, Robert de Tungelande is found to hold of the Barony of Fitz Alan by service of one muntator, his fee being of old feoffment?* At the Assizes of 1221 the then Abbot of Shrewsbury had a Writ against William de Thongeland, which however he did not follow up.25 Three nearly cotemporary Rolls give the Tenures of Fitz Alan's Barony in 1240-1. In one of them William de Thonglands is the Tenant by service of half a knight's-fee. The other Rolls imply that a Fulchered became Abbot in 1086-7, and was deceased, probably in 1113. Mr. Blakeway's chronology of the two first Abbots of Shrewsbury is inaccurate, and not warranted by Ordericus, on whose statements he ostensibly reUes. (Vide Bist.

Richard de Thonglands was Tenant here.20 About the same time (1241) we have Richard de Thuongland standing first witness of a deed which I shall quote under Corve. He is here followed by Roger de Thuongland and Robert fitz Henry de Thuongland. The Munslow Inquisition of 1255 takes no distinct notice of this Manor, but in 1256 Roger de Thongland was returned among those who, holding fifteen librates of land in this County, had not taken knighthood. Cotemporary with Roger de Thongland were Philip de Thongland, Lord of Upper Poston, and Richard de Thongland, of Aldon, Norncott, and Lower Poston. One Thomas de Thonglands has already been mentioned as occur ring in 1259, and as concerned in Cold Weston.27 In May, 1260, I find the Abbot of Shrewsbury suing Richard de Thongland for dis seizing him of a Tenement in Tugford.28 In 1267 one John de Tongelond fines one merk to have some Assize?9 The Inquisition on the death of the third John fitz Alan, in 1272, includes Thongland in his Fief.30 At the County Assizes in that year, it appeared that John, son of John de Thongland, having ob tained a writ de ingressu against Isabella de Hamme concerning a messuage, two carucates of land, and two Mills in Thonglond, failed to prosecute.31 In 1284 Roger de Bradeley held Thongelond of the heir of John fitz Alan by service of half a knight's-fee.32 An abstract of a series of Deeds33 will convey some further hints as to various interests involved in this Manor. \u2014 1.

In 1341 the Taxation of the Chapel of Thonglond being first quoted as \u00a34., the Commissioners assessed the Parish for the Ninth at 13s. 4d. There were no sheep here ; four virgates of land here paid tithe to Munslow Church, and only three and a half virgates paid tithe to this Chapel.35 This Chapel is not mentioned in the Valor of 1534, its suppression was therefore anterior to the Re formation ; yet its former existence would seem still to be known traditionally,36 as well as from the tbetter evidence afforded by the following list of its \u2014 EARLY INCUMBENTS.37 Sir Roger de Thongland, Chaplain, was instituted to the Rectory of Thongland on March 20, 1280, \u2014 Patron Sir Roger de Bradeleye.

Besides Stanway, Odo held Acton Pigott, Kenley, Golden, and half Gretton, under Rainald, the Sheriff; he also held Rushbury under De Laci : he was therefore a Chief among the Knights of Shropshire. Odo, whose Norman name, De Bernieres or De Berneriis, has been not quite obliterated by English Scribes, was living at least thirty years after Domesday ; \u2014 but I will treat of him and his descendants as they appear in their territorial connections. With this object I divide the Domesday Manor of Stanway into its constituents, and speak first of \u2014 BROADSTONE. One of the greater Confirmations to Salop Abbey (that of Stephen) tells us that Warin, the Sheriff, gave a part of the vill of Bradeston to that House.2 If this was so, the gift was prior to Domesday, and prior to the feoffment of Odo, in Stanway. The part too thus given will have been no part of the land mentioned in Domesday under Stanweie : the Monks probably annexed it at once to their neighbouring Manor of Tugford. Odo de Bernele and his Brother are among the Laymen who, about 1115, attended a Court of the Viceroy at Castle Holgate. It was apparently between 1121 and 1136 that Odo de Berneles gave to Salop Abbey a ferdendel3 in Bradeston.4, The Charters of Henry II (in 1155) and Henry III, 1 Domesday, so. 254, a, 2. 2 Monasticon, III, 519, a. 4 Monasticon, ibidem.

Possibly they were more than two, but if only two, I imagine them to have been \" Philip fitz Odo and Roger his Bro ther,\" the first of whom attests, about 1138-9, the Charter of Philip de Belmeis to Buildwas Abbey, and who both attest the same Philip de Belmeis' grant to Canons of Dorchester not ten years later.5 The following acquittance seems to have rebeved the Monks of Shrewsbury of all sendee due to the Seignoral Lord in respect of the land previously granted by his Tenants. I take it to be the Deed of that William fitz Alan who, being restored to his Shrop shire estates in 1155, died in 1160 : it runs thus, \u2014 \"William fitz Alan, to all his men, etc. I have conceded to God and to St. Peter quittance for one ferdendel, which is in Bradestan, and it was for merly (a member) of Stanewei, of the fee of Philip Fitz Odo.\"6 Philip fitz Odo, if living at the time of this deed, was certainly de ceased before 1165 : his successor was Roger fitz Odo, not, I think, his brother above mentioned, but more probably his son. \u2022 In 1165 Roger fitz Odo held the fees of one knight and three Muntators of the Barony of Fitz Alan; this tenure was of old feoffment .* he also held one knight's-fee of the Barony of Hugh de Lacy, which is said to be of new feoffment? The latter fee was unquestionably Rushbury ; but how it came to be enrolled as of new feoffment is a matter which I cannot account for. I cannot tell whether it was earlier or later than this, that is, whether it was in the time of the first or of the second William fitz Alan, that \u2014 \" Roger fitz Odo, of Rusbery, and his Brother and their Mother, conceded the ferndell in Bradestane, which their antecessors had given to St. Peter, and that this should be secured, William fitz Alan, Lord of that Honour, confirmed this donation with the impression of his Seal.\"8 5 Vide supra, Vol. II, pp. 203, 205. given on the principal Grantor's succes sion, we date it in the former period, and learn also that Roger fitz Odo succeeded from five to ten years earUer than we can otherwise show him to have done : and, in support of this, we find WiUiam fitz Odo (doubtless the \"Brother\" aUuded to iu the Deed) attesting Charters of the first WdUam fitz Alan between 1155 and 1160. 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 12. 7 Liber Niger, I, 142, 154. 8 Salop Chartulary, No. 11, attested by \" Rainald fitz Pagan, Reiner fitz Ren frid, Richard Sadoc, Radulf, Alan, Pai noth, WilUam, Robert, and many others.\" The Deed passed either between 1155 and 1160, or between 1175 and 1180.

All that I know further of Broadstone is as a possession of Shrewsbury Abbey, and has been expressed under Tugford or Thonglands : like the latter it is now in Munslow Parish. Of Broadstone Chapel, its origin or former state, I can give no account whatever. It is now, and probably always was, annexed to Munslow Church. Traditions, Architectural fragments, or Docu ments often apprise us of the former existence of Chapels, now de stroyed : here is a Chapel without, as I think, any such witnesses, yet still in being. UPPER STANWAY, LOWER STANWAY, STONE-ACTON. These Vills, which constituted the bulk if not the whole of the Domesday Manor of Stanweie, are separated, the last from the two first, but are all in the Parish of Rushbury. The whole passed from Roger fitz Odo, by whatever descent, to Herbert de Rushbury. The latter, who occurs in 1200 and 1209, gave, though perhaps at a later period, \" the whole land of the two Staneweyes, with all their appurtenances,\" to Henry de Audley, who was at the time accumulating a large estate in Shropshire and Staf fordshire. This gift, inter alia, was confirmed by a Charter of King Henry III, dated May 2, 1227? The Visors of the Forests of Shropshire, in 1235, reported that \"the Bosc of Stanewey was much wasted, what time it was in the hand of Henry de Audley, and that was in the time of liberty.\" This remark, together with what has been elsewhere said as to the allusions of this survey,10 will fix the year 1225 as a period when Audley was holding Stanway, and the year 1235 as a period when he no longer held it. We know also from other evidence that, be tween 1227 and 1240, Henry de Audley quitted all his right in Stanway to Madoc de Sutton in exchange for a share of Weston under Red Castle ; Madoc de Sutton therefore became Fitz- Alan's immediate Tenant at Stanway and Stone- Acton. His Under-Tenant at Stone-Acton, probably by his own feoffment, was Philip de Bur wardsley, who granted the same (estimated at half a hide) to the Knights Templars of Lidley. This was about the year 1240, and a Record of nearly that date exhibits Madoc de Sutton as holding 9 Rot. Cart, 11 Hen. Ill, p. 1, No. 51. | 10 Supra, Yol.

He does suit to the County, but not the Hundred : he gives the King 18c?. annually for stretward and motfee.\" And again, \u2014 \" The Templars of Lidleye have entered into Stoniacton by Philip de Burwardelleg, which contains half a hide of land, fifteen years back : and that vill, which is of the Fee of John fitz Alan, does not appear at the Sheriff's tourn as it used to do.\"1- The change was probably owing to the special privileges allowed to the Warrior-Monks. One Henry de Stonacton, amerced for default by the Justices of the Forest in 1262, was probably a Tenant of the Templars. With them we leave Stone-Acton, and proceed with the two Stanways. \u2014 In 1272, the Inquisition, on the death of the third John fitz Alan, gives Stanewey as in his Fief: it is not mentioned in the Feodary of 1284, nor yet in the Nomina Villarum of 1316. It continued to be a member of Fitz Alan's Barony, though apparently held by only half a knight's-fee.13 I return to say something of the Under-Tenants here. \u2014 John de Hungerford, before 1227, had sold to Henry de Audeley not only a meadow which he held of the Lord of Rushbury, but something apparently in Stanewey.1* In 1250, Isabella le Strange was assessed by Geoffrey de Langley for assarting one and a half acres in Stanwey :15 she was perhaps a Sister of Madoc de Sutton, bearing, if so, her Mother's name. Henry fitz John and Alice his wife were Tenants in Nether Stanwey in 1261. They (in right of the said Alice) were Vendors of their interest here to Robert de Belmeis, by a fine, already quoted as levied on June 3, 1261. I have also detailed the other interests of Robert de Belmeis iu this Manor, as well as those of his pre sumed son Hugh. I have further mentioned the sale therein by Hugh de Belmeis to John de Belmeis of Donington,16 and some- 11 Testa de Nevill, p. 45.

He pleaded King Henry Ill's Charter of 1271, which granted to Hugh de Beumes license to hold a market weekly on Thursdays, and a fair of two days (Oct. 8 and 9) yearly at Stanwey : he added, that he now held the manor by feoffment of the said Hugh, and that the privileges for which he was questioned were part and parcel of the said Market and Fair. Here Hugh de Lonther, the King's Attorney, objected that King Henry's Charter was to Hugh de Beumes and his heirs, and that John was not the heir of Hugh, but altogether un-related to him (omnino extraneus) . I cannot trace any further this curious question, which was adjourned to the next Parliament.18 I have before mentioned a suit prosecuted in 1260 by William, son of William le Fraunceys concerning a tenement in Stanwey.19 The name will recur again, but not in any intelligible connection with the said suit. In 1263 one John Aberd of Stanwei is taking out a Wi'it in some Suit at law : also Walter de Kenigford and Margaret his wife fine one merk to have a Writ ad terminum?0 It does not explain this to state that Alice, daughter of Walter de Kenigford, was sometime the wife of John Aberd, and was divorced from him. In September, 1272, Walter de Kenigford and his wife appear to have been dead. At the Assizes then held, Alice their daughter sued John Abel (Aberd) and Thomas de Holgotcastle for disseizing her of three messuages and one and a half virgates in Nether- Stanwey. John pleaded that Margaret, Mother of the Plaintiff, had enfeoffed himself and Roger le Franceys in the premises, and that Roger le Franceys had since transferred his interest to John. The Jury found that Margaret had indeed sometime given a part of the premises to Roger le Franceys, but only as Tenant at her will, that she had since re seized that part and given the whole to John Abel in marriage with her daughter Alice ; lastly, that when John and AUce were divorced, John retained the land. Hereupon the Court gave sentence of un just disseizin against John Abel.21 At the Assizes of 1292, some members of this family again appear ; for it is noted that Felicia, Juliana, and Isabel, daughters of John Aberd, withdrew the suit 20 Rot.

Roger fitz Odo, the head of his house, was living in 1167, when his Fief was amerced half a merk by Alan de Nevill. There was a Thomas fitz Odo living at the same time, but the name of the Lord of Rushbury, in 1180, appears stiR to have been \" Boger,\" for such a person was then ac countable for an imbladement of four acres in \" Rissibery.\"3 Between 1179 and 1189, as I have before shown,3 Petronilla, daughter of Roger fitz Odo, married Warner de Wililey, and had Kenley and half Gretton by grant of Thomas fitz Odo.

I further find, in correction of a former doubt, or rather error, that the son and heir of Roger fitz Odo was Herbert de Rushbury :4 if so, both Herbert and his Sister Petronilla were probably under age when the latter was married, and this will account for Herbert's not appearing in the negotiation then effected. We now come to something more certain than a choice between probabilities. It is clear that the next Lord of Rushbury, of whom we hear after Roger fitz Odo, was Herbert de Rushbury. \u2014 On Jan. 27, 1200, in Court at Westminster, Herbert de Russe bery, being at Russebery, essoigns himself through Ralph and Wil liam, his men, in a plea of land, wherein Walter de Witefeld was Plaintiff. The cause was adjourned to April 23, 6 1200; and on that day \" Walter de Witefeld, in behalf of Eva his wife, sues Her bert de Risbery for forty acres of wood and twenty acres of pasture, with the appurtenances, in Risberi, which he claims to belong to the free tenement of himself and his wife, which they hold in Kotes and in Wall, and which were of the marriage portion of Sibilla, Mother of the same Eva, whose heir Eva is. And Herbert disputes (defendit) their right, and puts himself upou the King's Grand- Assize, and asks that recognition be made whether he hath the better right to hold this land in demesne, or they to hold it under him.\" \u2014 A future day (June 18) was given to the parties, and then \" let four (Knights) attend to choose twelve \" (other Knights for a Jury).6 It appears from later entries on the Plea- Rolls (where however the Mother of Eva is called Basilia) that, on June 18, 1200, the four Knights having order to be in Court, Herbert es soigned himself. A further day (July 8) was given, and then both Herbert and the Knights excused themselves by the essoign called de malo veniendi. Another day (Oct. 20) was given, and then Walter de Witefield duly appearing in Court, Herbert neither came nor sent any essoign : so the Court ordered the lands to be seized into the King's hand, and Herbert was summoned to hear judgment on Nov. 25. Then again he did not appear, and the Court gave sentence : \u2014 \" Let Walter have his seizin of the lands in question.\" 5 Placita, Hdl. Term, 1 John, m. 4.

We hear little of Herbert de Rushbury iu connection with Shrop shire, and I think it very probable that the Irish interests of his Suzerain, Walter de Lacy, were participated in by him. About No vember, 1200, I find that Herbert de Rissebiry and Elias de Say (another of Lacy's Shropshire Feoffees) were joint claimants of land in Meath against William Parvus. They gave the King ten merks that \"their suit might proceed notwithstanding any Charter which William might have obtained from the King prohibiting him from being sued in any matter except before tbe King himself, because,\" said they, \" such Charter must always be construed to extend to the King's Chief Justice.\"7 The Shropshire Forest-Roll of 1209 exhibits several assessments for assarts and imbladements within Regard of the Long Forest. Herbert de Rushbery is assessed more than once under that name. Once he is called Herbert fitz Odo, and once he is onlv called \" Lord of Rushbury.\" Richard de Rusbury and Warner de Wililey are also assessed. Herbert de Rushbury was deceased before November, 1221, for then Petronilla, wife of Warner de Wililey, is called his heir, and, as I have explained, his Sister. In a suit which she had about Golden, Roger de Buterleg appears to have had a collateral interest : he was also a Feoffee of Lacy, at Bitterley. In 1240, Rushbury was held by service of one Knight's-fee of the Barony of Walter de Lacy, whose immediate Tenants were Stephen de Buterleg and Petronilla de Kenley.8 Petronillaj thus named, was now Widow of Warner de Wililey. As her share of Rushbury was hers by inheritance,9 so I conceive was Stephen de Bitterley's ; but how the latter inherited I cannot say. This divi sion of Rushbury between the houses of Willey and Bitterley makes it impossible to pursue any account of the Manor as a whole ; \u2014 for the truth is that it came to be split up into no less than six Manors, viz. Rushbury proper (half a hide), Eastwall (one hide), Westwall (one hide), Wall sub Heywood (one and a half hides), Coates (half a hide), and Wilderhope : which last (if half a hide) will complete the Domesday complement of five hides.

The latter is Complainant, the former (by his Attorney, John de Ruceham) is Deforciant of one messuage, three carucates of land, thirty acres of meadow, one hundred acres of wood, and 40s. rent, in Russebiry, whereof was plea of convention.

This is only technical language, the parts of a Manor being often put for the whole, and vice versa. What Warner and Petronilla conveyed to Trustees was that which they had to convey, and therefore only their share of these reputed Manors. In 1250, Geoffrey de Langley assessed an arrentation of 14c?. on Petronilla de Kenley, for forest-encroachment in Wilderhope. Ar rears of this rent are charged in her name in 1254, but it does not follow that she was still living : her age in 1250 must have been about eighty.

His Widow still retained her dower and inter alia, that Seigneural interest in Wall, which, during the minority of young Andrew de Wililey, entitled her to the custody of such lands as the said Andrew held of the Fief of Lacy.

Premising that this estate was specifically in Eastwall and in Cotes, I proceed to say briefly how it descended. \u2014 Sibil fitz Odo, as I presume to call her, was wife of a Lord of Longford, whose name is unknown. Both Sibil and her husband were deceased before 1165, when King Henry II had given Eva, their daughter and heir, in marriage to Robert de Brinton. The latter, sometimes kuown as Robert de Longford, was deceased in 1191, when Eva had remarried to Walter de Witefeld. Hence the appearance of the latter in the Suit of 1200. Eva's eventual successor was however Adam de Brinton, her son by her first husband. This Adam died, I believe, about Jan. 1235, and was succeeded by a son and heir, Adam de Brinton (II), who was living in 1255.

The Antiquity of this Church, slightly indicated by its architec tural remains, and supported by no direct early mention, may yet be deduced from a circumstance. I have already alluded to the interest which Hugh de Laci (who died before Domesday was com piled) and his Son, Roger (the Domesday Baron), took in the Priory dedicated to St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Guthlac, at Hereford.44 It appears to me that one of these Barons founded the Church of Rushbury and gave it to the said Priory, and that the right of the Priory was afterwards represented by a portion or pension, as was usual in these very ancient grants of Churches. Hence in 1291 we find the Church of Ryssebury, in the Deanery of Wenlock, va lued at \u00a313. 6s. 8c?. per annum, besides a portion of 13s. 4c?. which the Prior of Hereford had in the same :45 moreover the Rector of Rushbury had at this time a portion of 2s. from the Church of Hope-Boudler, a totally different matter, of which I will speak when I come to Hope Boudler. In 1341 the Taxation of the Church of Ruschebury is correctly quoted as twenty-one merks (\u00a314.), i. e. at the value of the Rectory and St. Guthlac' s pension combined: \u2014 but the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish only at \u00a35. The reasons were destruction of wheat by tempest, murrain of sheep, poverty and desertion of Tenants, and because the Glebe and Alterages went to swell the Church-taxation but were not computable in the Ninth?6 In 1534-5 the Church of Rusburye, of which Owyn Hinsmon was Rector, was valued at \u00a319. 15s. 4c?. per annum, in Glebe, Tithes, and Oblations ; which income is only stated to be charge able with a deduction of 7s. 8c?. for Archdeacon's Procurations and Synodals.47 The Prior of St. Guthlac's Pension had evidently ceased, and the cotemporary Valuations of his income do not em body any such item.48 \u25a0 EARLY INCUMBENTS.49 Richard, Rector of Rushbury, has already occurred to us in 1250, 50 and is mentioned twice in deeds of earlier date than 1265. 44 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 147-8. 45 Pope Nich.

Thomas fitz Odo was deceased on July 1, 1213, when Margery his Widow appeared by Attorney at Westminster claiming her dower, against Warner de Wililey and Petronilla his Wife : she claimed thirds in three and a half virgates in Kenley and in a hide of land and a MiU at Grotinton. Warner de Wililey would not reply to her claim without his Warrantor, viz. Thomas, Margery's son. The Court ordered the latter to appear on Oct. 6.3 On that day Jundewin de Esthop, Attorney of Warner and Pe tronilla de Wililey, essoigned himself in the suit of dower against Margery de Chabbenour. A further day (Nov. 10) was given. This apparently trivial entry identifies Thomas fitz Odo, Margery's late husband, with one who has occurred to us elsewhere both under that name and as Thomas de Chabbenour or Thomas de Tasley : of him I have still more to say presently. The suit of dower above mentioned was long unsettled, owing probably to those national disturbances which I have so often al luded to, as impeding at this period the routine of all public busi ness. \u2014 On Nov. 3, 1218, a Fine was levied at Westminster between Margery de Chabbenore, Plaintiff (through her Attorney Alexander de Chabbenore), and Warner de Wililee, Tenant, of one-third of the whole vill of Kenele, and one-third of half the vill of Gretinton, together with the Mill, which thirds Margery claimed as her rea sonable dower in the free tenement which was Thomas fitz Odo's, formerly her husband, in the same vills, and concerning which there was Suit at Law, etc. Now Margery remits all claim in the name of dower, and for that concession Warner gives her ten merks.4 It follows therefore that Margery's claim was a sound one ; in other words, she was wife of Thomas fitz Odo before he first gave up seizin of Kenley and half Gretton in favour of Petronilla, and nothing had since occurred to bar Margery's dower therein.

Hence, in 1255, the Munslow Jurors reported that \"Dame Burtha (read Burga), Relict of Nicholas de Wilileg, held one hide of land in the vill of Gretiton of John fitz Alan, and in the name of wardship of Ralph (read Andrew) her Son, who was under age.\" 6 I have given under Wilderhope the deed whereby soon afterwards Andrew de Wililey, now of age, exchanged a virgate in Gretton for a virgate in Wilderhope.7 The Feodary of 1284 tells us that Roger de Tullington holds the vill of Gretinton in right of his wife, who holds it in dower of the heir of Fitz Alan, by a fourth part of a Knight' s-Fee, and the said Heir holds it in capite? Premising that only half Gretton was thus held of the heir of Fitz Alan, but not questioning that Roger de Tullington held the other half of a different Fief, I can only guess who Roger de Tul lington was. I suppose him to have been the second husband of that daughter of Walter de Hugford, whose first husband, Andrew de Williley, fell at Evesham in 1265. If so, she will have had Gretton in dower. The other moiety of Gretton, viz. that hide which one Robert held at Domesday of the Earl, and which Odo held under Robert, has a somewhat various history to the last. The Domesday Mesne- Lords of each moiety were different, though they had a Tenant in common : of course, at the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, Robert's Tenure became a Tenure in capite of the Crown. But of any Robert as a Tenant in capite under Henry I, I know nothing, neither in deed do I know who the Robert mentioned in Domesday was ; I think however that his mesne interest in half Gretton must have vanished with that of the Norman Earls ; it probably reverted to Henry I, either by lapse or forfeiture. The ordinary result in such a case would be that Odo would become Tenant in capite of this moiety. Nevertheless I think that Henry I did not allow the mesne 6 Ibidem, 19 Hen. Ill, Salop. I \"' Supra, p. 101. s' Rot. Hundred, II, 70. 8 Kirby's Quest."], [562, "108 GRETTON. interest of Robert to become quite extinct, but granted it in some sort to his Viceroy, Richard de Belmeis. And now for any fact or hint which may serve to illustrate this curious question. \u2014 I first remark how Philip de Belmeis' Charters of 1138-9 and circa 1145 are attested, one by Philip fitz Odo, the other by the same Philip and Roger his Brother.9 This is con sistent with, if it does not suggest, the idea that the Grantor and Witnesses stood in the relation of Lord and Vassal. In 1230, Roger la Zouche was suing several Tenants in Salop, Sussex, and Devonshire, in a placitum servitii, i. e. to compel them to perform due service to himself as their Suzerain. Petronilla de Kenley appears to have been the Shropshire Tenant,10 but I do not find the result of the Suit. In 1255, the Representative of Philip de Belmeis was Alan la Zouch, as I have shown under Tong, also the Representative of Philip fitz Odo was Andrew, infant Son of Nicholas de Wililey. When therefore in that year we find that Robert de Beumys holds a moiety (one hide) of Gretton under Alan la Zouche, and holds it as Custos oi so much of Andrew de Wililey's estate,11 \u2014 we have the presumed tenure of 1138-9 clearly reasserted after an interval of more than a Century. This moiety then of Gretton had never left the tenure-in-fee of Odo's eldest representative, and both moieties were now reunited. The collective Manor in 1255 did Suit to neither County nor Hundred, but paid the King Stretward and Motfee according to the estimated hidage, viz. 2s. per annum.11 I have nothing more to say as to the Seigneural interests of Fitz Alan or La Zouch, nor yet of the Tenant-interest of Williley and Harley in Gretton. All three continued in the ordinary succession of each house till a later period than that which I have to deal with. The only Under-Tenants here, whom I shall mention, were the Wife of Robert Coterel and Matilda, the Widow of D. Coterel, assessed by the Regarders of the Long Forest in 1109: also Wil liam Coterel de Gretinton liable for some suretyship in 1262, and Roger Coterel de Grotinton assessed at the same time for vert, but excused as being out of regard. 3 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 203, 205. memb. 13 dorso. 10 Placita, Hill.

The first who occurs after Richard was Nicholas de Brotton, entered in 1165 as holding by service of two Muntators, under the Barony of Fitz- Alan.3 His Tenure was of old feoffment, and doubtless consisted of Brockton and Lutwych. Among the men of Shropshire who were amerced for Forest trespass in 1176-7 by King Henry II, Nicholas de Brocton answers for one merk. Soon after this, I believe Nicholas to have been suc ceeded by a son Robert, of whom I shall speak presently under Corve. Robert fitz Nicholas was in turn, I think, succeeded by a son William, who at the Assizes of October, 1203, under the name of William de Brocton, was found to have disseized Ulger the Canon of his free tenement in Brocton; \u2014 for which he had to pay 6c?. damages and a fine to the Crown of half a merk :3 I shall mention him again as \"William fitz Robert\" under Corve. The first entry on the Assize Roll of November, 1221, concerns Hugh de Brocton, successor, I suppose, of William. He sued Richard Lugein, Tenant, for a virgate in Broctun. Richard put himself on the King's Grand-Assize, and sixteen Knights were duly empanelled to try the case. Then the parties accorded, Hugh giving the King a merk for license thereunto. Their Fine is pre served, but conveys no further particulars than that Hugh de >3 Supra, Vol. I, p. 118, note 58. 1 Domesday, so. 254, b. 1. 2 Liber Niger, I, 144."], [564, "110 BROCKTON. Brocton renounced his claim for 20s., and that the suit had been originally one of mort d'ancestre. In August, 1226, Hugh de Brochton appears on a great Jury of the County, which had to investigate certain matters connected with the Forest of Stiperstones. On March 12, 1227, Hugh de Bracton is the third of the lay attendants at the Prior of Wenlock's Court at Burton, so often alluded to. In or about 1240, Robert de Brocton appears as Lord of Brocton, holding half a knight's-fee there of the Barony of Fitz-Alan.4 His Successor, and almost certainly his son, was Thomas de Brocton, whom the Munslow Jurors of 1255 found to be holding Brocton, for one hide and one-third of a hide, under John fitz Alan. He did suit to the Hundred both for Brocton and Lutwych, which latter was held under him by a Feoffee. He paid the King 16c?. annually for Stretward and Motfee due on Brocton,5 and such was the sum which, according to the average of Manors in Munslow Hundred, was charge able on any Manor of the extent specified. At the Assizes of January, 1256, Thomas de Brocton was sued, under the name of Thomas fitz Robert, for disseizing Roger de Kilmescott (Skimblescott) of a right of common-pasture over two bundred acres in Brocton, which right Roger claimed as appertain ing to his free tenement in Skimblescott. Thomas showed that the Plaintiff had never enjoyed this right, except as a matter of favour, and because he at one time did suit to Thomas's Mill in Brocton. The Plaintiff lost the cause.6 I find Thomas de Brocton sitting on a local Inquest in December, 1258, as also on the Jury for Munslow Hundred, at the Inquisition of 1274. A trespass which he then had resisted, and his subse quent treatment by the Sheriff, I have already detailed.7 In 1284, John de Brocton was holding the vill of Brocton, by half a knight's-fee, under the heir of Fitz-Alan.8 At the Assizes of 1292 he was a Juror for Munslow Hundred, and in March, 1316, he was still in possession here.9 His intermediate appear ances on local Juries, or as a witness of private deeds, it is unne- cessary to enumerate. 4 Testa de Nevill, 44, 48, 49. 6 Assizes, 40 Hen.

As regards any Under-Tenants in Brockton, I can only instance a Deed whereby, between the years 1256 and 1269, Nicholas fitz Robert of Waltone gave to Wenlock Priory 5s. rent, for support of the lights of the Church of St. Milburg aud the Chapel of St. Mary ; \u2014 payable to the Sacristan of Wenlock, and due from Nicho las fitz Alan of Brocton. 10 CORVE. This vill or township has long ceased to exist. We know how ever that it stood on the bank of the Corve, and there can be little doubt that its whereabout is indicated in the still existing name of Cone-barn.11 That Corve was originally a member of Brockton I am fully convinced. That a certain seignoral interest obtained here, by the Prior of Wenlock, in the twelfth century, should have detached Corve from Munslow Hundred, and annexed it to Wen lock Liberty, is a matter of no surprise, but rather in keeping with all analogy. I commence however with a period antecedent to that at which the Prior of Wenlock obtained ingress here, viz. while Corve was still of the Fee of Brockton, and at the disposal of Robert fitz Nicholas, presumed Lord of Brockton. He granted it in fee to Ralph fitz Edward, as we learn from that invaluable Charter,12 to which I have so often referred, and which I have sup posed to have passed about 1180. I now give this Charter entire : \u2014 \"Notum sit tam presentibus quam futuris quod ego Robertus films Nicholai concessi Corvet, tam in bosco quam in piano, in pratis necnon et in aquis et in universis suis pertinentiis, Radulfo filio Ed wardi et heredibus suis, in feudo et hereditate, perpetuo tenendam de me et heredibus meis, libere et quiete ab omni servicio per cen sum xv solidorum annuatim, propter homagium quod fecit mihi et 10 Blakeway's MSS.

The successor of Walter de Corve seems to have been John de Corve, the successor of Thomas de Corve to have been his son Philip. The said John and Philip are respectively first Witness and Grantee in a charter which I have given under Patton, and dated about 1230.14 That which Philip took under the said Deed he afterwards conveyed to Thomas, son (and I imagine younger son) of John de Corve. This second Deed, which passed I think about 1241, runs briefly as follows : \u2014 \" Philippus filius Thom\u00e6 de Corve dedi Thom\u00e6 fibo Johannis de Corve genito de Juliana uxore sua de Staunton pro homagio suo unam acram de assarto in Kalveleye, quam emi de Stephano domino de Patiton.

At the same time (1255) Corve had been re moved from Munslow Hundred to Wenlock Liberty. John de Corve did suit to the Prior's Court, and his tenure was estimated only as one virgate.16 John de Corve was succeeded by Richard de Corve, probably his son, already mentioned. Richard sat among the Jurors for Wen lock Liberty at the Assizes of October, 1272, as well as at the In quisition of November, 1274. Again, at the Assizes of 1292, he was a Juror of the Liberty, and in May, 1296, his name appears on a local Inquest. Ou October 20, 1300, a Fine was levied at York between William son of Thomas de Lotwich, Plaintiff, and Robert de Westbradeleye and Alice his wife, Impedients, of a third part of one messuage, one virgate of land, two acres of meadow, and two acres of wood in Corve, whereof was Plea of Warranty of Charter. Robert and Alice acknowledged to have given the premises to the Plaintiff, \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee. For this the Plaintiff paid them 40s.17 In 13 Hen. VIII (1521-2) the Foreign Rent-Roil of Wenlock Priory enters Corve among the vills and tenements which were ap parently held in fee, but the free-rent of Ralph Poynor, the only Tenant mentioned, was merely 8d. A Rent of 2s. 6c?. in Brocton is entered as not obtainable (non levabilis) ?8 The Minister's Ac counts of 1541-2 give the last rent (2s. 6d.) among the assets of the dissolved Priory.19 This was formerly a Manor in itself, and was thus described in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Rainald (the Sheriff) holds Loteis (of the *B Rot.

But one of these Lords of Brockton at an early period granted Lutwyche in fee to an Under-Tenant whose descendants took name from the place. The first of these of whom I find mention was William de Lotwich. He occurs in 1203 as Surety for a debt of five merks which Hamo Marscot (another Fitz-Alan Tenant) had contracted with the Crown. Next came Herbert de Lutwyche, whose son William is last wit ness in the following deed, which seems to me to have passed about 1240, and to be the act of an Under-Tenant of the said William : \u2014 \" William fitz Robert of Lotwyche, with consent of his wife and heirs, sells to Henry Clerk, son of William, Beadle of Esthop, for life of the lessee, an acre of land with the meadow at the top thereof, situate between lands of Richard de Kilmescot and Wil liam de Esthop, for 7s. paid dowu and an annual rent of 2c?. Henry is to take marl from the premises sufficient for an acre of land, and the Lessor is to take marl for his own land, but if, in so doing, he injures the Lessee's land, he shall give him an equivalent elsewhere. \u2014 Witnesses : Richard de MideUiope, Thomas de Esthop, Hugh de Patinton, Roger Parson of Esthop, William de Lot wyche.\" 3 Another deed of the same William fitz Robert passed perhaps five years later, and exhibits him as selling his whole estate in Lut wyche as held under William de Lutwyche, his Lord : \u2014 \" William fitz Robert de Lotwich, with consent of William, Lord of Lotwich, and of his (William fitz Robert's) heirs, gives to Peter, son of Ste phen Lord of Patinton, a messuage in Lotwich, between the tene ment which Herbert de Lotwich sometime held and the Garden of the Lord of Lotwich : \u2014 gives also all those lands which he, William fitz Robert, at any time held of Herbert, Lord of Lotwich, and of William his Son, viz. half a virgate thus sometime held, and two acres in the field towards Wildredhope which the Grantor's father 1 Domesday, fo. 251, b, 1. \u2022 This and all other Deeds quoted under Lutwyehe are in possession of Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury."], [569, "115 LUTWYCHE.

There is no evidence therefore that the Lords of Easthope, of whom we are now to speak, were Fulcher's descendants.

This John de Easthope was a man of some repute, and re mained in possession of his estate more than fifty years. During that period he is a constant witness of local deeds, and a Juror on Inquisitions and Perambulations, affecting other parts of the County.6 The reason of this probably was that he held office as one of the Coroners of Shropshire, and so ranked in importance only next to the Sheriff. He was appointed to this post after the Assizes of 1256, when he appears merely as a Juror for Munslow Hundred, but held it, and answered for his conduct therein at both the sub sequent Assizes of 1272 and 1292. At the latter Assizes he was one of the four who, being entitled \"milites et servientes,\" chose the twelve Jurors who had to try many Pleas of Quo Waranto between the King and his Shropshire subjects.7 At these same Assizes he was said, by the Munslow Jurors, to be holding 4s. annual rent in the Serjeantry of the Beysins,8 probably at Ashfield. I do not find that he ever ranked as a Knight, but on June 6, 1300, he was the first of those of next degree who made the great Perambulation of the Shropshire Forests, by ordinance of King Edward I.9 A Fine, levied at York on Oct. 6, 1303,10 may be taken as the the last Will and Testament of John de Esthope, though disguised in a technical form.

The Jurors assembled at Esthope on Feb. 17, 1306, viz. John de Presthope, Thomas le Enfant, Adam Arundel, Thomas de Patinton, John Engelard, and others. \u2014 They found that the de ceased had \" held the Manor of Esthope for term of his life, by ser vice of finding a man and horse at Oswestry, for forty days, in time of war; \u2014 that he had the Manor by concession of Roger de Esthop, by fine levied in the King's Court.\" The fine is then substantively recited by these accurate Jurors, who further depose that John, son of Thomas de Esthop, had died before John de Esthop, and without any lawful heirs by Margery de Wenlock, who was still surviving, and whom indeed he had never espoused; \u2014 that Thomas, son of Thomas de Esthop, and brother and heir of John son of Thomas, was the reversioner, and that he was twelve years of age on June 24 last (1306) A It is very possible that this infant Thomas was not more nearly related to the aged person who was dead than as Great- Grandson, or Grandson. Of that matter I have no evidence, and must leave the descent of the Lords of Easthope till, as Patrons of the Church of Easthope, they will again recur, for a further period. I now turn back a century, to take brief notice of a collateral branch of this family. \u2014 On Oct. 6, 1213, I find one Jundewin de Esthop acting as Attor ney-at-Law for Warner de Wililey.

The first notice which I have of this Church is in the name of its Parson or Rector, about a.d. 1240.

The Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish however only at 9s. The reasons were, that the greater part of the Tithe of the said Chapel belonged to the Church of Condour (Cound must be meant), and much of the Chapel's income consisted of Offerings, and there were no Sheep in the Parish ; moreover, what with mur rain among the live-stock, and diverse taxes, the best part of the Vill was annihilated.13 In 1534-5, the Rectory of Estope, of which Richard Backewege was Incumbent, stands valued at \u00a33. 6s. 8d. per annum.

William Garmston, Priest, was deprived of this Benefice June 8, 1383, he having murdered John de Esthope, Patron of the Church. Sir Hugh Cheyne resigned this benefice Feb. 19, 1386, having exchanged preferments with \u2014 Sir Thomas Clerk, late Rector of St. Owen's, Hereford, who is admitted here, Edith, relict of John de Esthope, exercising the right of Patronage.

Of this we have scattered but suf ficient proof. \u2014 \u00bb In 1180, their Bailiff (as I take it) here, was assessed 2s. by Jus tices of the Forest, under the name of Alurich, Provost of Acton.

That the Templars budt round Churches, and that places of the same name were often distinguished from one another by some adusion to their respective Churches, are matters sufficiently notorious to make Boteler's implied etymology of Acton Round worthy of attention. If we sup pose that the Chapel in question was ori ginady built by a Fitz Alan, but its form suggested by some cotemporary budding of the Templars of Lidley, we shad have made the most of the tradition. 2 I am indebted to Mrs. Stackhouse Acton for the fodowing information : \u2014 At Wynnstay there is a curious Regis ter, the work of Sir Thomas Boteler, Vicar of Much Wenlock, and recording matters which occurred to his notice between the years 1538 and 1562. Boteler says that \" the ChapeU of Acton Round was some tyme round like a Temple,\" and intimates that the Manor or lands therein had for merly belonged to the Knights Templars of Lidley. No Record that I have seen contains a hint of any interest of the Templars in Acton Round,\u2014 either in the Church or Manor.

Again, in 1255, the Munslow Inquest found John fitz Alan to be holding Acton, and two Mughales, and Muchel (Muckley) of the King. Fitz Alan did suit to the County, but not to the Hundred, nor did he pay streiivard nor motfee for this tenement, but the Jurors knew not his warrant for exemption.5 The Assize-Roll of January, 1256, reports a Perambulation made by precept of the King, between the land of John Fitz Alan in Acton, and the land of the Prior of Wenlock in Burgton (Burton) and Calweton (Calloughton). It seems that part of the wood of Sponhull (Spoonhill) was in question. The boundary determined mentions an oak-tree, \" Ronsok,\" which stood upon the King's highway between Weston and Wenlock, also another large (gros sum) oak-tree, which stood upon Corve towards the West.6 Acton Round was part of the Dower of Matilda de Verdon, Widow of the second John fitz Alan, who died in the Autumn of 1267. This Lady remarried to Richard de Amundeville, and with him was still holding her Dower on the decease of her son, John fitz Alan (III), in 1272. Her Grandson, Richard fitz Alan, was at the same time an Infant. It appears from a Writ of Edward I to the Justice of the Forest, dated March 18, 1278, that Richard de Mundeville and his wife were reported to be making great ivaste in the woods which belonged to the Lady's dower, but were of the in heritance of her Grandson, then a Ward of the King. The Justice was to make inquiries, and if he found the allegation true, to seize the said woods into the King's hand, and report all progress to the King in Parliament. Accordingly the Justice, on April 2 following, presided at Brug, over an Inquest composed of the Foresters, Ver derers, and Regarders of the Shropshire Forests. They found that the Wood of Shirlet within the Forest of Shirlet, aud the Wood of Sponhulle without the Forest, both being appurtenant to the Manor of Acton, were almost destroyed by Amundeville and his wife and their Bailiffs, that Hugh le Mascun, Woodwarden-of-the-Fee in those woods, had made prize and sale thereof, that he had been at tached and committed to the Sheriff for imprisonment, and that the Woods had been seized for the Crown.7 Matilda de Amundeville died on Nov. 27, 1283. Several In quests were forthwith held to value the estates which her husband in Munslow Hundred, and the Seigneury of both was in Fitz-Alan ; but their co temporary status, and the context of the Record quoted, exclude them from ad probability of being thus mentioned. 5 Rot.

The returns give accounts of young Richard fitz Alan's age, which differ from each other, and from better authority. This is not to be wondered at, seeing that two of the said Returns state Richard fitz Alan to have been son of the deceased Lady, whereas he was manifestly her Grandson. What now concerns us is, that the Jury which sat at Upton (Magna) on Dec. 18, found that Amundevill held in Acton la Runde, of the dower of Matilda, a messuage, a garden, one hundred and forty acres of land in de mesne, some meadow-land, rents, both free and customary, Woods and Pleas of Court, to the value of \u00a314. per annum? In the year 1284, though according to no account could Richard fitz Alan have attained his majority, he is entered as holding the Manor of Acton Round of the King in capite? The Inquisition taken at Acton le Rounde, May 21, 1302, on the death of Richard, Earl of Arundel,10 calls the Manor a member of Oswestry. The late Earl's demesne there consisted of a messuage, forty acres of arable land, one acre of meadow, and twenty acres of Bosc. The rents of free tenants were \u00a31. 10s. 6d. Twelve bondmen and four Cottars, holding about half a virgate each, paid \u00a34. 17s. 8c?. rent. The pleas and perquisites of Court were valued at nothing.11 It appears that besides this income, the Earl, while living, had demised to John de Sibbeton 100s. annual rent of cer tain Tenants in Acton Round, for the life of said John. This was unlawful, or said to be so, because the rent was a Tenure in capite, aud had been thus demised without license. So on the Earl's death, John de Beckbury, Subescheator of Shropshire, seized the said Rent for the Crown. Then again Richard de Harley, as Se neschal of the Earl of Savoy, who had the wardship of Fitz Alan's heir, seized the Rent. Sibbeton hereupon petitioned the King, and an Inquest, which ascertained the above facts, sat in August, 1304-5 ;12 but we learn nothing of the result, except that Richard de Harley, in a letter to the King's Chancellor, acknowledges him- self to be receiving the said Rents. 8 Ibidem, 12 Edw.

The first who seems likely to have stood in this position is that Thomas de Hactun, who, with Roger his Brother, attests, about 1180, the Deed quoted under Corve. In 1191 we have notice of Engelard de Acton, as being amerced half a merk for some false claim. There were two or three persons of this name in a succes sion, which lasted upwards of eighty years. I cannot distinguish them, and therefore will set down what I find of them collectively, as well as of other Under-tenants in Acton Round.

His amercement was excused on account of poverty. His Sureties, viz. Gerard le An gevin, and William, Clerk of Ludlow, were in misericordid. At Warwick, on Jan. 14, 1222, Engelard de Acton, on behalf of himself and his wife Laurina, sued WiUiam Hunaund for half a virgate in Acton as the right of Laurina, whose former husband, Richard de Baschirch, had wrongfully sold it to said William. William first pleaded that the premises were not Laurina's mar riage-portion, but a purchase of Richard de Baschirch, whose son and heir he called to warranty. Then he pleaded more specifically that Alexander, Laurina's Brother, had sold the premises to Richard de Baschirch. An Inquisition was ordered, returnable at West minster on the Quinzaine of Easter.16 Owing to default of the De fendant on two occasions, the land was seized by the Crown in the first instance, and given to Engelard and Laurina in the second, viz. on the Quinzaine of Trinity Term.16 On Oct. 13, 1227, Ingelard de Acton was on a Shropshire Jury, which attended the King at Worcester.

Adam, Parson of Acton, who in March, 1227, attended the Prior of Wenlock's Court of Burton, is the first Rector of Acton Round whom I can instance, and his style implies the earbest no tice which I have of this Church.18 In my account of the Church of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, I have recited the process which ended in Bishop Swinfield's as signing the Chapel of Acton-Rotunda to the said Church as a mere affiliation, because situated on \" St. Milburg's land.\" 19 Tbis was in the year 1284, and Master Hugh de Pedwardyn, the then \" Occupant \" of the Chapel of Acton Rotunda, was deprived, whilst any Chaplain serving the same in future was to pay a pen sion of 2s. per annum to the Mother-Church.

In 1291, the Church or Chapel of A cton Rotunda, in the Deanery of Wenlock, is set down as belonging to the Prior of Wenlock, and valued at \u00a36. 13s. 4c?. per annum?0 Again, it was confirmed to the Prior as a dependent Chapel of the Church of the Holy Trinity by Bishop Charlton in 1331.21 In 1311, the Church-Taxation of Aicton Ronde Chapel being quoted at ten merks (\u00a36. 13s. 4c?.), the Assessors of the Ninth proceed to rate the Parish at \u00a32. 16s. only. The reasons for the abatement were, \u2014 destruction of the wheat-crop by an unfavourable season, want of all sheep-stock in the parish, non-cultivation of several holdings through poverty of the Tenants, and because the small-tithes, glebe, and offerings of the Chapel, went to the esti mate of the Church-Taxation, but were not to be reckoned in the present instance.23 In 1369, the Spiritualities of Wenlock Priory include a sum of \u00a35. receivable from the Chapel of Acton-Rotunda, and a later list of the Tithes payable to the Priory includes those of Rownd Acton without giving their value.23 This was apparently because they were devoted to the special support of the Convent. In 1534-5, the \" Portion \" received by the Prior from the Vill oi Acton Rownd was returned at \u00a33. 6s. 8c?. ; but among the pen sions payable by the Prior, we now hear for the first time of 14s. payable annually to the Rector of Cownde, for the Chapel of Acton Rownd.24 This indicates, I think, that the Lay Lord of Acton had at some very early period given the tithes thereof to the Church of Cound, but that the latter had relinquished them for a composition to the Prior of Wenlock, as Lord of the spiritual fee of St. Milburg. The Valor of Churches in Wenlock Deanery makes no mention of this Chapel. The Diocesan Registers are silent as to its occu pants, and except the two Rectors already named, I find no men tion anywhere either of an early Incumbent or a later Chaplain.

Nevertheless it is certain that Shrewsbury Abbey profited nothing by this grant, and it was perhaps the very fact of their losing Abdon which in duced the Monks to be thus particular in recording their title. Again, it is all but certain that the Knight Robert, and his Nephew Richard, did not regain what the Monks lost, nay, that the line of Azo became extinct within a few years of this grant ; for in 1165 Abdon and certain others of Azo's Domesday Manors had doubtless gone to form those two knights' -fees of new feoff ment which John le Strange then held of the Barony of Fitz Alan.7 If, on the other hand, Shrewsbury Abbey retained its previous and royally confirmed grant of a virgate in Abdon, that virgate be- 4 Avelina, Mother of the first William fitz Alan, seems to have died about the time of his restoration to Ids Shropshire estates, viz. 1155. the Monks to denote their little pro perty.\" 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 309. 7 Liber Niger, I, 144.

In 1226 Geoffrey de Ledwych, of whom I shall speak more par ticularly elsewhere, held Abdon under Le Strange, and was im pleaded by William, son of Achilles, for half a virgate there, under writ of mort d'ancestre. Geoffrey not appearing before the King when at Shrewsbury in August, the case was adjourned till the next eyre of the Justices.8 This happened to be in October, 1227, when a Fine was levied between William, son of Achilles, Plaintiff, and Geoffrey de Ledewic, Tenant of the said half-virgate.

In 1240, Abdon was clearly among those 2\\ fees which were held by John le Strange of Fitz Alan's Barony,10 but the Under- Tenant is not named. The fee was however still in the Ledwyches, and the Munslow Inquisition of 1255 tells us how Geoffrey de Leddewich then held Abbeton for two hides of land under John le Strange, the said Geoffrey doing suit both to the County and Hundred, and paying the King 2s. per annum for stretward and motfee.11 The Inquest omits the further fact of Le Strange hold ing under Fitz Alan.

However as Agnes was under age, the Court overlooked her liabibty to amercement, and allowed her to pursue the cause under a different writ.14 This she did at the same assizes; suing Herbert the Te nant (here called Herbert le Bonde) and Emma his wife, for the said half- virgate ; but the Defendants not appearing, the land was seized into the King's hand, and John de Bracy, Agnes's father, was ordered to sue in her place on account of her nonage.10 I find not the result of this suit; but in September, 1258, Walter de Kapel has a writ of novel disseizin against Geoffrey de Lethe wich and others, concerning a tenement in Abeton.16 In 1284 a younger branch of the Ledwiches was holding Abbeton of the elder, that is, Roger de Ledewyche held the vill of Geoffrey de Ledewyche, Geoffrey of John le Strange, and John le Strange by half a Knight's-fee, \"of the King,\" says the Record,17 again ignoring the mesne seigneury of Fitz Alan. How Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, acquired Abdon I cannot say. At his death iu 1292, he was holding the Vill of Sir John le Strange, for half a knight's-fee. The Rents receivable by him were from Free Tenants 37s., and from Customary Te nants 50s. per annum. The pleas and perquisites of his Court were worth Is.18 However the Inquisition on the death of Philip Burnel in 1294 states him to have held Abedon of Geoffrey de Ledwych,19 whose mesne interest seems to have been forgotten on the death of the Bishop. Philip Burnel died on June 26, 1294; but on June 5 previously, the King's Bailiff had put certain Merchants of Lucca in possession of portions of Philip's goods, chattels, and receipts, in and from 14 Placita de Juratis, ibidem, memb. 4. 17 Kirby's Quest.

In or about 1138, Abdon had one of those Chapels which Bishop Betun then assigned to Shrewsbury Abbey,23 probably, I think, as having been founded within the spiritual fief of St. Gregory of Morville. It appears that \" Alveric the Dean,\"24 in the Bishop's presence, rendered up the Chapel in penitential form, seeing that he had done the Monks of Shrewsbury injury in the matter. The Bishop orders that Abdon should for ever be accounted a Chapel, in which state he had found it. Another and nearly cotemporary Charter of Bishop Betun con firms Salop Abbey in the receipt of a pension of 2s. from the \" Church\" of Abbeton.26 On Nov. 18, 1240, a Fine was levied at Shrewsbury, between Henry, Abbot of Salop, Plaintiff, and Geoffrey de Ledwic, Defor ciant, of the Advowson of the Church of Abbeton, whereof was assize of darrein presentment.

In time of King Edward the Manor was worth 12s. (per annum).\"1 We have several very early and apparently authentic notices about Beckbury, but no two of those notices present any features, from which, under combination, we can realize an intelligible whole. Azor, the Saxon, we have heard of as Lord of Burwarton and Neenton, places which had subsequently nothing in common with Beckbury. Roger Venator' s Domesday Manors went, as a general rule, to constitute a Tenure in capite, known afterwards as the Fief of Pul verbatch, that Manor being the principal one involved. Yet we have no assurance, nor anything more than a hint, that the Lords of Beckbury had any subsequent tenure in the said Fief of Pulver batch. That hint, such as it is, shall be given in its place. Mean time, I must speak of matters apparently quite irrelevant to Roger Venator or his descent. The position of Beckbury, \u2014 isolated from, yet included in Patin ton Hundred, \u2014 its connection with Badger, the two forming a de tached portion of Hereford Diocese, \u2014 its later history, \u2014 all these convince me that, long before Domesday, St. Milburg had some interest here which at the time of the Norman Conquest was ig nored, but afterwards revived. This theory becomes almost fact when, within forty years after Domesday, we find the Prior of Wenlock disposing of the Wife, the Heir, and the land of one Rainald, whom the Prior evidently considered to have died his Te nant as regarded a hide of land in Beckbury ; \u2014 all, to wit, which Domesday had alleged as the contents of the Manor.

I will first follow out the subject of the Prior of Wenlock's Seigneury in Beckbury. In King Richard I's reign, Beckbury was removed from Brims tree Hundred to the Liberty of Wenlock, and its Lord (Hugh de Beckbury, I think) thenceforth did suit by afforciament to the Prior's Hundred Court at Burton. In 1255 Philip de Beckbury, being Lord of the vill, is said simply to hold it of the Prior of Wenlock,8 as if there were no other or co ordinate Seigneury. His annual rent to the Prior was 25s., the very sum reserved in the lease of 1120. Yet we have no evidence that Philip de Beckbury was descended either from Walter fitz Warin the then Lessee, or from Rainald the then deceased Tenant, or yet from Warner de Beckbury, a principal witness. Again in 1255, the collective hidage of Beckbury, Badger, and Madeley is given as four hides,9 while the Domesday measure was 2 The idegible word here was perhaps originady a Christian name. 5 Ipsius \u2014 scilicet Walterii filii Warini. r> The word et should probably he in serted. 7 Register at Willey, so. 6, b. \"\"'J Rot.

In 1291 the Prior of Wenlock's temporabties included an assized Rent of 25s. receivable from Beckbury.10 In 13 Hen. VIII (1521-2) the Chief-rent received by the Prior from Edward Grey, then Lord of Beckbury, was still 25s. ;n and after the Dissolution the said rent is expressly stated to have been paid to the Crown. It is now time to observe the constant parallel which is to be found in the histories of Beckbury and Badger. Both are men tioned in Domesday as Manors of small extent, and held of a lay fee. At all subsequent periods we find a lay -fee in each, amply suf ficient in point of extent to satisfy the Domesday measurements. Yet we also find in each a co-ordinate seigneury of Wenlock Priory, existent doubtless before Domesday, yet not alluded to in that Re cord. We find that this seigneury was exercised over lands clearly distinct from those which belonged to the lay-fee of each Manor; that the Prior had his peculiar chief-rents, the Lay-Lords theirs. Also we see that the Prior's partial interest in each Manor ope rated, in the reign of King Richard, to change the hundredal sub jection of the whole of each Manor, of whomsoever held. We shall lastly have to observe the most curious coincidence of all, viz. that as in Badger so in Beckbury, the Prior's Tenant became eventually identical with the Lay-Lord's Tenant. Thus it is that a series of facts, anomalous and suspicious when illustrated by only one ex ample, becomes somewhat more intelligible and perfectly credible when exemplified in a second instance. Before I proceed with some account of the Prior's Tenants at Beckbury, I should recapitulate the little that is known of an other tenure (also a hide) in this Manor. It seems to have been held at one time by Philip de Grete, and if so, perhaps under the Lords of Richard's Castle. Philip's Tenants were again various, and not well agreed among themselves.

Bagesore, and Beckbury shared or quarrelled over this tenure. All the particulars which I have of their interests have been given under Badger.12 The first known Lord of Beckbury was that Hugh de Beckbury of whom I have already said so much under Harrington, and else where.13 I here add a few further particulars : \u2014 About 1196, and probably soon after his marriage with Alina Mussun, I find him attesting a great Charter of Wilbam fitz Alan (II) to Reyner de Lee. At the County Assizes (October, 1201), he was amerced three merks for some disseizin. At the Forest Assizes of March, 1209, the following charge was brought against him : \u2014 \" Richard de Prestewode (a Forester appa rently) going through his Bailiwick of Morse, followed two men till he came up with them, viz. Hugh de Bectebury and Thomas his Brother. They had with them three greyhounds, out of leash, and five hares ; but when Richard had arrested Hugh, Thomas drew his sword and released him. Both then took to flight, and Richard raising the hue and cry pursued, till night took the fugitives from his sight.\" It appears that this matter was compounded by some unspecified, but doubtless heavy fine, proffered by Hugh de Beck bury at these same assizes, viz. \" that he and Thomas his Brother might be quit as to this, \u2014 that they had taken hares in the King's Forest.\"\" This Hugh de Beckbury, it seems, had an estate at Hill Wot ton, in Warwickshire, under whom held I will not here inquire. With consent of Alice (read Alina) his wife and John his heir, he grants half a virgate in Wotton to Godwin fitz Godwin, of Wotton. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir William Prior, of Kenilworth ; Robert Painel, Constable of Kenilworth, etc.15 This was between the years 1214 and 1226; for Hugh de Beck bury, as I have said under Harrington, died about the end of the latter year. pastures adjacent to the Abbey Foregate by the name of \" Becbury\" (Hist.

There is not a par ticle of evidence to connect the grant with this Beckbury, or I should notice it at length. I am quite at a loss however to suggest the true locality of that grant. A Rental of Shrewsbury Abbey describes two"], [591, "BECKBURY. 137 Godwin fitz Godwin, it appears, gave to Kenilworth Priory a rent of 5s., issuing out of the land which he held of Sir Hugh de Beck bury, Knight ; l6 and \" Alina de Beckberi in her widowhood released to the Priory all her right in the tenement which the Canons had from Godwin fitz Godwin in the vill of Hull. \u2014 Witnesses : Henry Tycun, and Hugh, son of Alina de Beckberi ;\"17 \u2014 that is, her second son, her successor at Harrington. Of Hugh thus mentioned I have already given a full account. John de Beckbury, eldest son of Hugh Senior, succeeded him at Beckbury, and on March 12, 1227, is found attending the Prior of Wenlock's Court at Burton.18 At the Assizes of October, 1227, John de Beckebir was amerced five merks \" because he withdrew himself,\" \u2014 from some suit, I suppose. It took three years to bquidate this heavy fine. About 1240 three collated lists of Fitz Alan's Barony record substantively, and I think untruly, that John de Beckbury then held an eighth part of a Knight's-fee in Beckbury, of that Honour.19 He was also a Co parcener in a Knight's-fee held in Pulverbatch, of the Honour of Pulverbatch,* \u2014 a coincidence which I should not meddle with here, except to remark that Beckbury had once belonged to the same Barony. John de Beckbury was living after the year 1248, but was dead in 1254. Philip de Beckbury was his son and heir; and on October 6, in the latter year, a Fine was levied at Westminster between Agnes, Prioress of Brewode, Plaintiff, and Philip de Beche bur', Deforciant, of two merks rent, which Philip should pay out of two Mills in Bechebur', whereof was suit at law. Now Philip undertook for himself and his heirs that they would pay for the future one merk yearly at Brewode ; and the Prioress remitted the other of the two merks which she was claiming.20 In 1255 Philip de Beckbury occurs as a Coparcener in the Ser jeantry of Uppington, an inheritance which came to him from his Grandmother Alina. He was bring in the year 1292, and was after wards succeeded by his son John ; but as nothing occurs to me in connection with this succession which I can also associate with Beck- 16 Dugdale's Warwickshire (Thomas), p. 270. 17 Kenilworth Register,' ut supra. 18 Monasticon, V, p. 74 ; Notes, No. 5.

I have given under Badger Church the exact ratio of the patron age of the Church of Beckbury.21 The Prior of Wenlock presented the Rector to the Bishop of Hereford ; but the said Rector was first nominated to the Prior by the Lord of the Fee, and the Prior's me diate right of presentation was represented by an annual pension of 3s., covenanted to be paid by the Rector when instituted. That which, exclusively relating to Beckbury, I have not mentioned under Badger, is as follows : \u2014 In 1291 the Church of Beckbury, in the Deanery of Wenlock and Diocese of Hereford, is entered as of less than \u00a34 annual value.22 In 1379 the Chapel of Bekkebury, valued at five merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8c?.) per annum, is said to belong to the Presentation of the Prior of Wenlock.23 The Prior's pension (3s.), arising from his mediate right of Pre sentation, appears in a Roll of the year 1456 as being due annually on the feast of the Translation of St. Milburg.2'* Again, it is men tioned in the Valor of 1534\u20145 as a Portion received from the Vill of Becbury.25 The Valor also gives the Rectory of Beckburye, of which Richard Rugge was Incumbent, as worth \u00a3o. 6s. 8c?. annually, in glebe and tithes.

The only explanation which I find of the Leuga, as a square measure, makes it equal to twelve Q.uaranteines. The Quarantena oi Domes day is said to be represented by the mo dern Furlong (Forty-long). The forty perches, which composed the Quaranteine, must however have been square perches, not perches of twenty feet in length, as one Commentator instructs us (Vide Ken net. Glossar. Paroch. Antiq. sub voce Quaranlena). 2 I coin a word to represent what I in fer from a multitude of opinions to have been tbe condition of the Domesday Coli berti. They seem to have been Serfs par tiady enfranchised ; that is, each held some land or other tenement, and paid a fixed rent in money, produce, or personal ser vice. But the Coliberti belonged to the land ; they were ascripti gleb\u0153, bke the Vdlains, and required further manumission to make them Liberi. 3 The Leug\u00e6, Leuu\u00e6, and Leuuedes of Domesday are, I suppose, identical. That"], [601, "143 STOTTESDEN. Ancient Demesne. This however is said with some qualification, as regards the adjuncts of the Manor. The seven Berewicks which Domesday attributes to Stottesden, were, all or most of them, out lying members thereof and were granted away on various condi tions, I think by King Henry I. This will be more apparent when we come to speak of those Berewicks. The Central Manor, which alone reached the hands of King Henry II as Royal Demesne, contained, I think, only four of the nine hides of Domesday. Its fiscal value was, at the time of that Prince's accession, reputed to be \u00a3\\4. 3s. per annum, and so much the Sheriff, as Fermor of the County, may be presumed to have paid at the Exchequer, for each of the four first regnal years of Henry II. It was sometime du ring the year ending Michaelmas, 1159, that the King granted this estate to Godfrey de Gamages, \u2014 a date and a fact which are thus ascertained. \u2014 The Sheriff, accounting at that period, deducts from his gross obligations the following items : \u2014 \" Et in terris datis Godefrido de Gamages, \u00a3\\4. 3s. et \u00a37.\" 4 In what quarter the King's grant of seven Vibrates of laud lay I cannot ascertain, and indeed it seems to have been revoked within the next year; for the Sheriff, accounting at Michaelmas, 1160, attributes to Godfrey de Gamages a gift of Crown lands to the extent of \u00a3\\4. 3s. only, but states it expressly to be in Stottesdun? And this entry on the Sheriffs' Robs con tinues, without material variation, till Michaelmas, 1176, when Matthew, son of Godfrey de Gamages, appears as his Father's suc cessor in this matter of Royal bounty.6 The history of the Norman Family of Gamaches belongs rather to Herefordshire than to Shropshire ; nevertheless I pause to make one or two remarks as to its origin and earlier interests. The Castle and Vill of Gamaches were situated in the Norman Vexin, and gave name to a Deanery in the Archdiocese of Rouen. God frey de Gamaches, who doubtless derived his name from this vill, inherited two Knights'-fees of old feoffment in the Herefordshire Barony of De Lacy.7 The English interests of his family were therefore estabbshed previous to the death of King Henry I. It is probable that Godfrey de Gamaches took some active part in the restoration of Henry II, for, in the year previous to that in which he had a grant of Stottesden, the King gave him fourteen Soli dates of Crown land in Herefordshire, and also excused him a debt *\u2022 * \u25a0 \u00ab Rot.

Mansel Gamage, the estate held under Lacy, went to Matthew's younger brother Wil liam, by disposal of their Father.10 A matter, touching Matthew de Gamages's Shropshire interests, during the reign of Richard I, has already been detailed. From Easter 1193 to Easter 1197 Stottesden was an Escheat}2 The af fairs which were cotemporarily taking place in Normandy will serve to explain this. By the Treaty of Issoudun, in December, 1195, King Richard I ceded to Philip Augustus the Castle of Gamaches, with the rest of the Norman Vexin. On the renewal of hostili ties, in 1196, that Castle became the scene of one of those few brilliant exploits which grace the name of John Earl of Moreton. He recaptured it, and it was instantly fortified and garrisoned for the King of England, at an expense commensurate with its im portance as an outpost on the then shattered and debatable fron tier. From that time till the year 1203, when Normandy was finally lost to the English Crown, the position of Matthew de Gamaches will have been as critical as that of the Castle and dis trict with which his name is associated. The Rolls from 1197 to 1203 show him in possession both of Stottesden and of the Here fordshire Manor, which he held in capite.12 Moreover, and as if his allegiance to the English Crown had been regarded as important, he stood seized in 1201 of three Royal Manors in Staffordshire, viz. Wiginton, Tettenhall, and More.12 Such bribes were vain. Matthew de Gamaches preferred a French allegiance, and all his English estates reverted to King John. The forfeiture of Stottesden in particular seems to have taken effect about Easter, 1204, for the 8 Rot. Pip. 4 Hen. II, Herefordshire.

This again continues till Christmas, 1223, when the Earl of Chester, as Sheriff, attributes a quarter's reve nue, or \u00a33. 10s. 9d., to Yvo Pantulf; while the Earl of Salisbury, accounting at Michaelmas, 1224, attributes \u00a310. 12s. 3d. in Sto desdon (that is, the revenue of three-quarters of the year then ended) to William de Gamages.17 We conclude that, about Christ mas, 1223, William de Gamages was restored to this estate of his family, \u2014 a conclusion which must presently be tested by other evi dence. Even before the crisis which separated his elder Brother from England, William de Gamages had experienced the favour of King John. In or before 1201 he had a grant of Crown-lands in Glou cestershire.18 In 1203 he had a similar grant in Normandy.19 Again, in the same year, King John gave him the Rutlandshire Manor of Cotesmore.

On April 17th, King Henry III pronounces the Herefordshire Manor of Dilun to be his \" right and inheritance.\" It was Dilwyn, \u2014 the Manor which Matthew de Gamages had held in capite, and though on his forfeiture the estate had been given to another, an equivalent was now to be provided elsewhere for the said temporary Grantee ; urther steps were taken in July and August foUowing to enforce the King's intentions in this matter.26 In November, 1217, William de Gamages appears as entitled to a share of the Gloucestershire Manor of Westbury, in right of his wife Lisebell, daughter and co-heir of Henry de Minerhs.27 On March 14, 1218, the Sheriff of Herefordshire has orders to restore to him his land of Boyhckered, of which he had been disseized during the late war.28 I must now return, to give a more particular account of Stottes den. It appears that King John's grant thereof to Ivo and Hugh Pantulf was provisional, not in fee and inheritance. Hence a Re cord of the year 1211 describes the said Ivo and Hugh as holding the Manor of the Bailiwick of King John,29 that being the term by which these limited Tenures in capite were indicated. The King John cancelled the exchange, thus restoring Tettenhall to William de Ga mages (Claus. I, 56). 2J \u2022 \u25a0 Mis\u0153, p. 125. Pr\u0153stita, pp. 212, 223. 23 \u2022 24 Clems.

Grant was afterwards suspended, probably in the year 1215, and by reason of the suspected disloyalty of the Grantees. Hugh de Mortimer (of Wigmore) then seems to have had, or to have claimed ingress therein, under some concession of King John. That Mon arch however on December 2, 1215, orders Thomas de Erdinton to seize the Manor into the King's hand ; but if Hugh de Mortimer could show any Royal warrant for holding it, then Erdinton was to act towards him accordingly.30 In July, 1216, as we have already seen, William de Gamages had King John's Writ for the restitu tion of Stottesden. However, within two years of Henry Ill's accession, Ivo and Hugh Pantulf obtained that Prince's order to the Sheriff to restore the Manor to them. But this was not acted upon ; for on December 26, 1218, another Writ31 issued to the said Sheriff telling him to delay such restoration, and recounting the two alleged but discordant grants of the late King, viz. the first to Yvo and Hugh Pantulf, as of the King's Bailiwick, and to sustain them in the King's service ; the second to William de Gamages, as his right and inheritance : the Sheriff was to pause till the ques tion was determined before the King's Council, as to which claim was superior. It was not till October 18, 1219, that the King's Justices Itinerant in Shropshire, were apprised of William de Ga mages's sound title, which the King had discovered by inspection of the Rolls?2 What followed must be inferred from the fact that, at the Assizes of November, 1221, Yvo and Hugh Pantulf sued William de Gamages, for disseizing them of their free tenement in Stottesden. To this charge William de Gamages replied by alleging King John's Writ in his favour. The Sheriff also appeared in Court, and put in the two writs of King Henry III already quoted, viz. that to himself enjoining delay, and that to the Justices Itinerant. The Sheriff further explained that these Writs had caused him to disre gard the earlier Writ in favour of the two Pantulfs, who, it seems, had never been reseized. The Plaintiffs, hereupon acknowledging that the question was not as yet fully settled in the Curia Regis, as to whose right was the best, were ordered to attend and hear sen tence at Westminster on the Octaves of Hilary (1222) .33 On May 7, 1222, the King orders full reseizin for William\" de 30 \u25a0 31 Claus.

The Pipe Rolls do not recognize the restitution till Michaelmas following. Meantime, that is in February, 1221, WiUiam de Gamages had letters of Scutage, as personally assisting at the siege of Biham.35 In August, 1223, he had a similar favour in regard to the Scutage of Montgomery.36 On November 16, 1223, the King orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to respite, till the next It er of the Justices, a demand of three merks, which the said Sheriff had against William de Gamages's men of Stottesden. Their misdemeanour was that they had not produced in the County Court a certain ladder from which another Tenant had fallen, and so been kibed.37 In April, 1225, we hear of William de Gamages as having cus tody of Ludlow Castle on behalf of the Crown, for which office he received a salary of fifty merks per annum?8 On June 13, 1233, the Kiug being at Worcester and the Barons of the Marches being required to give hostages for their faith and services till the Realm should be more tranquil, William de Gamages so gave his son Henry, who was committed to the custody of Walter de Beau champ.39 At Michaelmas, 1235, and Easter, 1236, when the Aid on marriage of the King's sister was collected in Shropshire, Wil liam de Gamages paid two merks thereon, that being the propor tionate assessment on one fee, said to be of old feoffment ; he paid it by hand of Gamel de Stottesden.40 The Pipe-Roll of Michael mas, 1239, attributes the Tenure of fourteen librateS and three solidates of land in Stottesden, in the usual way, as \" given to WiUiam de Gamages.\" But the Roll of 1240 represents John de Plaseto as accredited with the current year's ferm, intimating moreover that the King had given him the said lands to maintain him in the Royal service, and to hold during the King's pleasure. The fact is that WiUiam de Gamages was, at this time, deceased ; that the King had reco vered Stottesden from Godfrey de Gamages, son and heir of WU liam, and had bestowed it on John de Plessetis, but in the limited and conditional way above indicated.

Before I proceed with any account of the new Lords of Stottes den, it wUl be fitting to trace to its extinction the male line of De Gamages. Godfrey succeeded his Father at Cotesmore, in Rutland shire, and at Mansel Gamages, and other estates in Herefordshire and in Wales. He died in 1253, and I find an order to the King's Escheators to seize his lands, dated Oct. 2, of that year.41 Also in the same month, Alda, his Widow, was suing John de Plessetis for a third of the Manor of Stottesden, which she claimed as her dower. The cause was adjourned to Hilary Term following, but the litigated land being apparently seized into the King's hand, John de Ples setis moves the Court to reinstate him at once therein.43 This was probably done, either immediately or eventuaUy, for I cannot sup pose that Alda's claim was ever aUowed. Godfrey de Gamages left three daughters and Coheirs, viz. Elizabeth, Lucia, and Eufemia. Elizabeth appears to have been married to Henry de Pembruge, Junior, previous to April 20, 1254, when I find her, her husband, and her two Sisters, jointly impleading one Richard de Tunderley for the land of Trewarn, which, being a member of that Honour of Boghred late held in capite by Godfrey de Gamages, had been wrested from the said Godfrey by the said Richard de Tunderley, under the false pretence that it was a member of the Honour of Castle Matilda in Elvein.43 On May 10, 1254, we find, as I have before related,44 that Henry de Pembruge, Senior, purchased from the King the marriages of Lucia and Eufemia de Gamages, for two of his other sons. The Ladies were taken from the custody of Margery de Lacy, who I suppose had them in ward by reason of their late Father's tenure at Mansel Gamages. I have also before alluded to another claim of two of these Coheiresses, viz. Elizabeth and Eufemia, who, in 1263, were endeavouring once more to recover Stottesden from Hugh, son and heir of John de Plessetis above-mentioned. Their claim was unsuccessful, as the sequel will show.

We now return to John de Plessetis, the powerful and fortunate favourite of Henry III, and whose Title to Stottesden was evidently framed in disregard of the better claims of hereditary descent. His history, as sometime Earl of Warwick, I need not dwell upon here. In the year following that in which Stottesden was given to him conditionaUy, he obtained a grant thereof iu Fee and inheritance, with all its Liberties and appurtenances.45 In 28 Hen.

The heir of himself and his first wife, Christiana de Sandford, was Hugh de Plessetis, aged twenty-six years at his Father's death.52 In April following this Hugh had livery of the Manor of \" Suttes don\" (read Stottesdon) \" as a tenure in capite, by service of one knight's-fee,\" his Relief thereon being 100s. He had also livery of other lands inherited from his Mother.53 He married Isabella, one of the three Coheirs of Philippa Bassett, sometime Countess of War wick, and on Nov. 29, 1265, had livery of his said wife's estate.54 In 54 Hen. Ill (1269-70) Hugh de Plessetis gave the Manor of Stottesden, in frank marriage with Christiana his infant daughter, to John, son of Nicholas de Segrave,65 which John seems at the time to have been about fourteen' years of age. The Jurors of Stottesden Hundred reported this transfer at the Assizes of Sep tember, 1272, adding, that it was without the King's consent. They also reported John de Segrave to be then seized thereof; but among the Defaulters in their Hundred appears the name of Nicholas de Segrave,56 as though the Father were accountable for the Suit and Service due from Stottesden while the Son was in minority. At the Inquisition of Stottesden Hundred, taken in November, 1274, the Jurors traced accurately the descent of this Manor from John de Plessetis to Hugh de Plessetis. The alienation thereof by the latter they also dated in 1270, and explained that Nicholas de Segrave was to hold Stottesden for his life.57 This however he did not do ; for though he himself lived till 1295, his Son John was in 1277 fully seized of Stottesden. There was a Military Summons return able at Worcester on July 1 of the latter year, and John de Segrave responded thereto by acknowledging the service of one Knight' s-Fee in Stottesden, performable by himself and John Mallore, his serving man.58 The Feodary of 1284 consistently reports that \" John de Segrave and Christiana his wife hold the Manor of Stotresdon for one Knight's-fee of the King, in capite.\" 59 50 \u2022 51 Assizes, 40 Hen.

At the Assizes of 1292 the Jurors of this Hundred said that John de Segrave claimed Free- Warren in Stottesden ; also to hold his Free-Court there twice in the year, and decide aU such Pleas as the Sheriff ordinarily decided ; also the privilege of assizing bread and beer. Being questioned, as it seems, for his authority to exer cise these Franchises, John de Segrave pleaded the Grant of King Henry III of the Manor and its liberties to John de Plessetis and Ms heirs. At the time of that grant, said he, the King held the two annual Courts in question. As to assizing bread and beer, that was further justified and implied by the Grant of Market given to the same John de Plessetis by the same King. Hugh de Lowther (the Crown Attorney) hereupon started a favourite objection of his in such cases, viz. that a Grant to John de Plessetis and his heirs could not extend to the present Defendant, who was not his heir. The result was a reference of the matter to the next Parliamant.60 The Feodary of March, 1316, gives John de Segrave as Lord of Stottesden.61 He died in 18 Edw. II (1324-5), seized inter alia of this Manor.63 His Son Stephen had obtained, four years previously, a Grant of the Hundred of Stottesden for life.63 He died in the same year, and apparently in the same foreign service as his aged Father. The Heir of both was John, son of the said Stephen, which John was then in minority ; but of him I need say no more.

King William (I or II), reciting and confirming the Earl's grants to the Abbey, specifies that of the Church of Stottesdou, and indicates the very vills which formed its possessions or Glebe. They were Dodel mutha (read Dodelwicha, i.e. Duddlewick), Hinetona (Hinton),and Prestecota (Prestcote).66 The next point to notice, or rather recall, is, that Earl Roger in 1086 granted a third of the Tithes of Stotes den to his Collegiate Church of Quatford.67 The Tithes of the Earl's demesne must here be understood ; but it adds much to the suspi cious character of one of Earl Hugh's Charters to Shrewsbury Ab bey, when we hear that in the next generation the said Earl Hugh granted the tithes of his demesne of Stottesden to that House.68 However another and a less suspicious Charter of Earl Hugh clears up the difficulty. Thereby the Earl grants to Shrewsbury Abbey hvo-thirds of the tithes of his Demesnes of Stottesdone, Neutone (Newton), and Walkeslawe ( Walker slo w) .69 I forbear to recite the repeated confirmations of Stottesden Church which Shrewsbury Abbey obtained from Henry I, Stephen, Henry II, and Henry III. It would seem that the Monks in the first instance appropriated the Church estates to themselves, and also extorted a pension of \u00a34. per annum from each Rector whom they presented to Stottesden. Such a pension is sanctioned by the Confirmation of Bishop Robert de Betun, about 1138. The same Charter con- firms to the Abbey the tithes of its whole demesne of Dudelwich and of its demesne of Stotesdun (meaning, I suppose, Hintou and Prestcote) ; also two parts of the demesne-tithes of the Lords of Stotesdun and Walkerlowe.70 The last-named tithes are again con- firmed by the Charter of Bishop Gilbert Foliot.71 The next Con- firmation is that of Bishop William de Vere. It admits Master William de Calne to Stottesden Church, and institutes him Rector thereof as well as of all its dependent Chapels, mentioning those of Fernlawe (Farlow), Wuerketon (Wrickton), Eston (perhaps Aston Botterell), and Wethull (Wheathill).

The Abbot was summoned to make reply before the King in Easter Term follow ing.73 On July 30, 1242, the King appoints Alexander, Treasurer of St. Paul's, as a Justiciar, to try a question whether certain land in Stottesdon belonged to the Church thereof, or was the lay-fee of the Abbot of Salop.74 The matter, or some question involved there with, seems to have come eventually before a Papal Delegate ; for on May 23, 1244, a King's Patent, declaring that \" Stephen Han niball had summoned William de Haverhull, Possessor (Incumbent, I suppose) of the Church of Stottesden, out of the kingdom, con trary to the privilege granted to the King by the Pope,\" proceeds to appoint Robert de Shardelowe as the King's Proctor, to lay be fore the said Judge-Delegate such things as the King should deem expedient.75 Archbishop Peckham's Confirmation, dated August 23, 1280, sanctions the pension of \u00a34. receivable by Shrewsbury Abbey from the Church of Stottesden.76 Soon after this the Church appears to have become a Vicarage, the Abbot of Shrewsbury procuring an appropriation thereof from Bishop Swinfield. The first Charter on the subject bears date September 25, 1283. The Bishop merely confirms the Church of Stottesden to the Abbot and Convent, saving a competent provision for the Vicar. On Sept. 4, 1286, the same Bishop settles the Vicarial Income at thirty-three merks (\u00a322.) per annum, by an Ordinance which assumes the gross Value of the Church to amount to the astonishing sum of \u00a386. 13s. 4c?.77 For the particulars of the Vicar's endowment of thirty-three merks I refer elsewhere,78 merely remarking that no subsequent Valuation of either the Rectorial or Vicarial Income is equal or proportionate 72 Chartulary, Nos. 338 b, and 351.\u2014 This Institution was in the time of Abbot Ralph, and so between 1186 and 1190.

On the 18th of AprU, 1290, Richard Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford, visiting this part of his Diocese, and, as I infer, the Church of Stot tesden, passed the night at Duddlewick, where forage for forty-one horses of his train was provided by the Abbot of Shrewsbury, while the rest of the day's expenses were discharged by the Bishop him self.79 The Church-Taxation of 1291 values Stottesdon, that is, the Abbot of Shrewsbury's Rectorial income therefrom, at \u00a326. 13s. 4d. ; be sides this the Vicarage, called the Vicarial Portion, was \u00a313. 6s. Sd. The Abbot of Wigmore had a portion of 13s. 4d.; the Rector of Corn ley a portion of \u00a31. ; the Precentor of Wenlock Priory a portion of 13s. 4d., and the Dean of Brug a portion of 6s. 8d., from Stottesden Church.80 Of the origin of none of these pensions except the last can I give any satisfactory account. The last doubtless represented a composition between the Abbot of Shrewsbury and the Dean of Brug, whereby Earl Roger's grant of Stottesden Tithes to Quatford Church had sometime been commuted for a fixed annual charge. The same Taxation informs us that the Vicar of Stottesden received an annual portion of 2s. from the Church of Wethull. -This doubt less was the result of the ancient dependence of WheathUl Chapel on the Mother Church of Stottesden. On March 15, 1291, the King ordered Malcolumb de Harley to make Inquest as to the Advowson of Stottesden : this was done at Bridgnorth, on April 30 following. The Jurors found that \" Roger de BeUeume\" (they meant Earl Roger), \"who came with the Con queror, gave Stottesden Church, with other Churches, to Salop Ab bey, so as that, when the then Rectors should die, the Abbey might retain those Churches to its own uses, presenting from time to time a fit Clerk for Institution to the Bishop.\" They further found that Clerks were thus instituted, tiU, on the death of Ralph Dungoun, the last Rector, the Abbot had appropriated the Church, with Epi scopal consent indeed, but after the enactment of the Statute of Mortmain. The Jurors had inspected charters of Earl Rpger, King- William, and Henry III, bearing on the matter, and produced by the Abbey. They valued the Church at one hundred merks, and said that the Portion recently allotted to the Vicar was thirty (not thirty-three) merks ; that it would not injure the King to allow the appropriation unless there were concurrent vacancies in Stottesden Church and Shrewsbury Abbey, when the King would lose a pre- \u25a09 Household Expenses, p. 76. | \u2122 Pope Nich.

Hugh de Lou ther, in the usual form, deduced Edward I's title and descent from Henry I. The Abbot appealed to a Jury, apparently of Knights, who were to try the single issue whether the King or the Abbot had the better right. The said Jury found for the Abbot.82 It will be seen, from what has been stated above, that the value of Stottesden Church, that is, the Rectory, Vicarage, and four pen sions, amounted by the Taxation to \u00a342. 13s. 4d. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth, after correctly quoting that Taxation, pro ceeded to rate the Parish at \u00a315. 6s. Sd. to the current impost. The reasons for the diminution were, because the Glebe of the Church was two Carucates of land and 50s. rent (included in the Taxation, but not now to be reckoned) . Moreover 500 acres in the Parish lay unfilled, and there was no stock of sheep or lambs, and the Tenants had quitted under stress of poverty. Again, the hay and other small tithes were computed in the Taxation, but were not regarded in estimating the Ninth ; but in reckoning the said Ninth the Assessors had taken care to include the Temporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey,83 which, as I suppose, were not accounted of in the Taxation. In 1534 Thomas Abbot of Shrewsbury returned, among the re ceipts of his House, a sum of \u00a38. as the year's issue of the Tithes of Stottesden, and 13s. 4d. as the ferm of the Tithes of Duddlewick.84 The Vicarage, then held by John MaunceU, was valued, in glebe and tithes, at \u00a315. 12s.

Whether \u2014 Gilbert de Lacy, suing the Abbot for a presentation to this Church in 1207, succeeded in his object, I cannot say. One \u2014 Ralph, Parson of Stottesden, is stated to occur in the time of King John (1199-1216) _87 The next Rector of whom we hear was \u2014 William de Haverhull, named above in a Royal Patent of May 23, 1244. We have seen this person cotemporarily holding the Prebend of Alveley, in the Collegiate Church of Bridgnorth;88 he was also Prebendary of Islington, in the Church of St. Paul's, London. He died August 23, 1252. I cannot tell who that Arch deacon of Salop was who, having been Rector of Stottesden, appears to have died before 1256. Possibly it was \u2014 John Foliot, Archdeacon of the Hereford Archdeaconry of Salop in 1244, and who had been succeeded in that office, previous to November, 1255, by James de Aquablanca. The vacancy of Stot tesden Church in 1256 occasioned a letter from the Pope (Alex ander IV) to King Henry III, wherein the King is required to admit\u2014 Master Stephen Annibaldi, Canon of Furnes, to Stottesden Church, who had been presented by Pope Gregory.89 Pope Gre gory IX must be the Pontiff here alluded to, and, whereas he died August 21, 1241, we thus get an explanation of the fact before quoted, viz. that in 1244 Stephen Hanniball had summoned the Rec tor in possession out of the kingdom, \u2014 doubtless that their respec- to have reckoned the Great tithes of the Church of Dodylweke (read Stottesden) at \u00a312.

At the time when the Appropriation of this Church was being arranged, that is, 1283-1286, it was vacant, owing, as we have already seen, to the death of \u2014 Ralph Dungoun, the last Rector; but on Sept. 4, of the latter year, Bishop Swinfield admits the first Vicar, viz. \u2014 Sir William de la Grene, Chaplain,90 presented by the Abbot and Convent of Salop. This Vicar has occurred to us before in 1294.91 Thomas de Lodelowe, Priest, was admitted Jan. 16, 1301. (Same Patrons.) Hamo de Schidwic, Priest, admitted Jan. 21, 1321, was, at a Visitation in the same year, found to have deserted his Church, and was summoned on August 22, 1321, to show cause why \u2014 Walter de Fingham be not admitted on presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury. The latter was so admitted; and, on his resignation (April 5, 1326), \u2014 Philip de Gosinton was instituted on a like presentation. On Dec. 12, 1328, he exchanged preferments with \u2014 William Talbot, late Rector of St. Swithin's, Worcester, who occurs as Vicar of Stottesden in 9 Edw. Ill (1335-6).

We must there fore expect to find the detached territory held subsequently in capite of the Crown, and not under the Lords of Stottesden. The foUow ing Vills will be found not only to correspond pretty nearly, both in number and hidage, with the territory inquired after, but to fulfil all other conditions necessary to establish a proximate identity : \u2014 1.

This place occupies the very south-eastern angle of Shropshire : it is cut off from Stottesden by eight miles of intervening territory, and by the Forest of Wyre, a barrier which even at the present day will not seem insignificant. But Dowles, thus isolated and distant, was yet, under another name, a member of the Domesday Manor of Stottesden. Its ancient name was Achisey, or Hakieshey. Either one of the Palatine Earls, or else King Henry I, granted it to Wydo, son of Helgot, at a ferm or rent of 2s. per annum. Of Wydo, son of Helgot, I have spoken under Quat. I have also shown how, previously to the year 1127, he granted Achisey to Malvern Priory, a grant conceded by King Henry I, who at the same time released the Monks from the annual ferm of 2s. payable to the Suzerain.100 I must now quote further from King Henry's Winchester Charter of 1127, in order to show more fuUy that the land conveyed to the Malvern Monks was identical with Dowles. m Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 174, 175."], [623, "DOWLES. 161 The King is reciting a grant be had made of laud eastward of the Severn, aud perhaps a part of the Royal Manor of Kidderminster. He uses these words,101 \" I give them also the land of Northw',102 to assart between Hauekesbroc and Lindrugesithe from Heneduneia to the Severn, to hold quietly and freely for ever.\" He then adds, \" And on the other side of the Severn I give them two solidates of land, that is Hakiesheia, together with a certain part of the wood which pertained unto Stottesd', according to those bounds, where of Fulco, the Sheriff, has caused perambulation to be made, which Fulco hath seized them (the Monks) thereof by my command ; and this land I allow to be free of the said 2s. and of aU other services.\" Of Dowles under its new name, and as a possession of Malvern Priory, we hear next to nothing for two centuries. Malvern was a CeU of Westminster Abbey, and the great Franchises of the latter House extended to its affiliations. Hence any outlying estate of Malvern Priory seldom came into such circumstances as would lead to its mention in national or provincial Records. One exception to this silence illustrates the general rule. In October, 1292, the Prior of Great Malvern was sued under process of Quo Waranto, for his right of holding Pleas of the Crown, of seizing the chattels of his men, when fugitive or convicted (of felony), and of having ways in his Manor of Doules. The Prior appeared, and said that he held two great Courts yearly, composed of his own men, in which he tried all pleas which Sheriffs ordinarily tried in their Towns ; he also had ways and the chattels alleged, and in justifi cation of all this he cited Henry Ill's comprehensive Charter to Westminster Abbey and its Cells. This Charter certainly seems to countenance all that the Prior claimed and much more besides, es pecially as it provides that even if any of the allowed franchises had not been exercised they might be exercised in future. It was to this point that Hugh de Louther, the King's attorney, addressed himself, stating that the King himself (Edward I) had exercised these franchises in question till the Prior appropriated them of his own authority. The matter went to a Jury, which found that the Prior had never held the said two Courts, nor tried any Pleas of the hay) and Hauekesbroc (Hawkesbrook), one west the other east of the Severn, were perhaps connected in local nomenclature with Hawkbatch, a little north of Dowles, a place which still retains its name. 101 Monasticon, III, 448, No. III. 10- The name North- Wood is still pre - served : it is eastward of the Severn, and exactly opposite to Dowles Wood on the western bank.

The Suit of Court thus lost to the Crown they valued at 2s. per annum. So on this Point the Prior was in misericordid ; he forfeited the said suits and their appurtenant franchises, which re mained to the King ; he also had to pay 6s. damages for the three years above-mentioned. Afterwards the Judges conceded the dis puted Courts to the Prior for an annual rent of 6s. 8^. if the King would accept it. As to the Chattels and Ways, two clauses of King Henry's Charter were thought sufficient warranty for the Prior's claim thereof.103 The Taxation of 1291 omits* the Prior of Malvern' s interest in Dowles, unless a carucate of land at Northwod, and 20s. of assized rent there, can be supposed to include both estates.104 In 1534, Dowiys and Northwood are collectively valued as a Shropshire estate of Malvern Priory. The assized rents and rents of Tenants at-will were \u00a39. 18s. 9d. ; the fines, heriots, and amercements of Court were 10s.; the average profits from wood were \u00a31.; the total of \u00a311. 8s. 9d. was lessened by 10s., the annual value of some structure (kedelli) in the Severn which had been destroyed by the King's order.105 The Ministers' Accounts of 1542-3 give a total of \u00a312. 15s. 6\\d. as arising from similar sources, but mention Dowles only as the estate thus valued.100 DOWLES CHURCH. It is difficult to conjecture how this Church came to exist. Had it been built before the Manor passed to Great Malvern, it would surely have been also an affiliation of Stottesden Church. Ou the other hand, we know that Monks were not prone to found Parish Churches, though seldom backward in appropriating them when founded by others. In the case before us, so exceptional in many points, even Monachism may have departed from its practice and built a Church. More singularly still, Dowles Church was never appropriated by the Malvern Monks, but remained a Rectory till the Dissolution. It was dedicated to St. Laurence. The earliest notice of its existence is implied in the List of its Incumbents, presently to be given.

WBICKTON AND WALKERSLOW. These two Vills, undoubted members of the Domesday Manor of Stottesden, have usuaUy been combined by circumstances, and therefore should be treated of together. That Earl Hugh, after Domesday, continued to hold one, and probably both of them, in demesne, is proved by his granting two-thirds of the tithes of Walkerslow to Salop Abbey. I have spoken of the famUy of Beysin under BiUingsley, Badger, Broseley, West-bradley, and Ashfield. Under the last locality I attributed the Serjeantry held by them to the foundation of King Henry I.109 He, as Lord of Stottesden, had undoubtedly the power to alienate any of its members. That he so alienated Walkerslow, and constructively Wrickton, I find further proof in Bishop Betun's confirmation of Tithes to Salop Abbey, soon after the death of Henry I ; for the Bishop speaks of the Lord of Walkerslow as a distinct person from the Lord of Stottesden. This Lord of Walkerslow was probably also Lord of Wrickton, holding both Vills by Serjeantry and by gift of King Henry I, and transmitting both to his descendants, the Beysins. I think there was a Robert de Beysin of this line living in the time of Henry II, but deceased in 1194, the date when his son, or successor, Adam, was amerced for marrying Mabel de Burwardsley. Robert's widow, Petronilla, seems to have survived him twenty-six years, as I shall presently show. -<\u2022\u25a0\" Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 214, 240. j m Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 346. 108 From Blakeway's MSS."], [626, "164 STOTTESDEN. In a Record of the very beginning of the thirteenth century I find the earliest statement as to the nature and extent of De Beysin's Serjeantry. \u2014 \"Adam de Beisin holds in Burkinton (read Wurkinton, i. e. Wrickton) and in Walkeslawe one carucate of land, of his Serjeantry, in demesne, and two carucates in Villanage. The same holds in Effield (Ashfield) a fourth part of a carucate in Villanage. The Demesne is worth 12s., the Villanage worth 60s. (per annum) . The same holds two MiUs which are worth 8s. (per annum) . He holds (the whole I presume is meant) by custody of one of the King's Hawks.\"110 In 1203 Adam de Beysin's Ser jeantry was assessed to the fourth Scutage of King John at half a merk, the current rate being two merks on each Knight's-Fee. At the Autumn Assizes of the same year he essoigned his attendance under the common summons, his Essoignor being Robert fitz Aulin. The next year he was assessed \u00a31. to the fifth Scutage of King John, as if he were a tenant in capite of three-fifths of a Knight's fee, the current rate of Scutage being 2\\ merks per fee. In 1211 Adam de Bersin (read Beisin) is entered among the Shropshire Tenants by Serjeantry : his service is to act as the King's Falconer (Austrucarius) .nl Another Record names his Tenure as in Wyketon.m At the Assizes of November, 1221, I find Matilda fitz Henry and Leticia her Sister in misericordid for not prosecu ting their Suit of mort d'ancestre against Adam de Beisin.113 The Stottesden Jurors at the same time presented that PetronUla, widow of Robert de Beyssin, was in the King's gift, her land (held in capite in then* Hundred) being worth 2i merks annually.11* In 1228, Nicholas de Beisin, whom I have mentioned as suing the daughter of Adam de Beisin for land in Ashfield,115 had a simUar suit of mort d'ancestre against the Father for two virgates in Wal kerslow, but renounced his claim by Final Concord, dated May 31, he receiving 2i merks for such surrender.116 In August, 1228, Adam de Beysin is suing his neighbour Ralph de la Lowe (i. e. The Low) for unlawful erection of some stank.117 The Defendant's amercement (half a merk) is entered on the Pipe-Roll of 1232. The last that I hear of Adam de Beysin (I) is his attendance on a Jury of Knights, who had to try a great Shropshire cause before the King at Worcester. This was in October, 1237, and the next year he died.

His attestation of a Pickthorn Deed, in 1241-2, proves him to be then a Knight.119 Robert, his son and heir, was born Au gust 15, 1242 ; and on Dec. 13, 1243, Adam died, so that his Relief stiU appears in arrear on the Pipe-RoU of 1250. In 1255, the Jurors of Stottesden made a report as to \" Wyrke ton,\" which must be taken to include Walkerslow. It was as fol lows : \u2014 \" Robert, son of Adam de Beyssin, who is in custody of Baldwyn de Freville, by the King's appointment, is Lord thereof. Therein is a hide and half of land, which the same Robert, when he shall have come of age, should hold of the King in capite, his ser vice being to keep one Hawk for mewing, and to carry the same before the King, from the feast of Michaelmas to the Purification of the Virgin ; and he shall receive from the King for the afore said service ohd. per day, and two robes per annum for his Serjeantry.

The lands of the Ward were estimated at 100s. annual value. The Inquisition ordered to be taken May 4, 1261, has been before aUuded to,121 and in one instance with some inaccuracy. The defaced condition of the docu meut only allows us to conclude that it speaks of Wrickton and Walkerslowe as two Manors. It is not an Inquisition on the death of Adam de Beysin, but an Inquisition to prove the age of his heir, which it fixes as nineteen years, on August 15, 1261. How Sir Wilbam Devereux came at this period to be involved in the affairs of Robert de Beysin, and indeed to exercise guardianship over him, 118 Salop Chartulary, No. 10. 119 Supra, Vol. I, p. 240.

The interference which I have noticed uuder Billingsley and Broseley extended to Wrickton and Walkers low; for at the Forest Assizes of February, 1262, the Justices, as sessing a fine of half a merk on the wood of Wlokesloive (Walkers low), because being within Regard of Shirlot Forest it had been long wasted, call it \"the Bosc of William D'Evereus.\"122 The Inquisition of September, 1263,123 which reported the full age of Robert de Beysin, described his deceased Father's Tenure in capite of the Manor of Wirketon and Walkeslawe. It further stated William Devereux's right of wardship to have been derived from Sibil Gifford, which seems irreconcilable with other accounts before given. Sir William Devereux fell on the rebel side at Eves ham, on August 4, 1265. The favour shown to his Widow by a Patent of Oct. 12 foUowing,124 was on December 12, 1266, extended to his Son. The Patent, then issued by the King at KenUworth, records that the elder Devereux had stood with the King at Lewes, and dates his offences against the King and Prince Edward as sub sequent. It allows his heir to redeem his lands by payment of three years' value thereof, except such lands as had already been granted to Matilda, widow of the deceased, for the support of her self and her children.125 I have, under Broseley, related how Robert de Beysin dying before Sept. 19, 1267, Hugh de Beaumes had the disposal of his widow in marriage, and custody of his infant heir's lands at Wrick ton and Walkerslowe. In Trinity Term, 1271, we have an illus tration of this. Hugh de Beumes duly appeared coram Rege as against Adam de Bolde, who, when Hugh's servants had taken a fox in Hugh's demesne at Wyrketon, and had conveyed it to Hugh's Manor-house (Curiam), had come and forcibly abstracted the said fox. Hugh laid his damages at 40s., but the decision of the case was adjourned.126 The Feodary of 1284 exhibits Walter de Beysin (son and heir of Robert) as holding the Manor of Wirketon and Walkerlowe of the King in capite, by service of keeping one hawk in winter-time at the King's cost.127 At the Assizes of October, 1292, the Munslow Jurors estimated the Beysin Serjeantry to extend over two carucates of land, which they placed in Wyrketon, and valued at \u00a316. 11s. 122 Forest Roll, 46 Hen.

All the other details of their statement point to lands in Ashfield, and have been already given.128 It is probable that they mentioned Wrickton unadvisedly : it was not in their Hun dred. The cotemporary Jurors for Stottesden Hundred129 reported Walter de Beysin's default in due attendance at the Assizes, also his Tenure in capite of Wrickton and Walkerslowe, and how the peculiar service which he owed the Crown was returnable on a summons by the King's Wobode?30 Between the years 1294 and 1301, I find Walter de Beysin employed on various Royal Com missions as au Assessor and Collector of taxes and as a Commissioner of Array. His estates, of more than \u00a320. annual value, caused him to be served with the usual MUitary Summonses in parts beyond Sea in 1297, and against the Scots in 1301. In 1302 he was re turned as Knight of the Shire of Salop to the Parliament which was to assemble at London or Westminster at Michaelmas, and on Oct. 14 he obtained his Writ of Expenses for so attending.131 In 1308 and 1309, he again appears as a Commissioner of Array, and on July 30, 1309, had Mibtary Summons against the Scots. His last Commission bears date December 18, 1309, and related to some judicial inquiries in Herefordshire.132 But on January 4, 1310, he was deceased, for then did the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum issue to the proper Officer.133 The Inquest held at Brug, on January 19 foUowing, is very full as to his various tenures and relations. He had held Wrickton and Walkerslow in capite of the King. A third of Broseley he had held of the Prior of Wenlock by the peculiar service before pointed out.134 In Staffordshire he had held a third of Ashley in capite; also the Hamlet of Shuston of the Prior of Wenlock, by a quit-rent of 10s. per annum; also 20s. of rents at Longenore, for which he paid a quit-rent of 6s. Sd. to the Baroness of Stafford; also 40s. rents at Eton (Church Eaton), where his Seigneur was the Bishop of Chester. His wife Alice was a daughter of Sir Hugh Burnel, and it would appear that on her marriage a settlement of some other Estates had been made, secu ring her an ample portion in case of survivorship. Thus the de ceased and his wife had been jointly enfeoffed by the said Sir Hugh 132 Parliamentary Writs, IV, pp. 507, 508. 133 Inquisitions,3~Edvr.U,~Ko. 58. On ginalia, 3 Ed.

Thomas de Beysin, son and heir of the deceased, was twenty-two years of age Jan. 8, 1310. This Inquest omits the Beysin Tenures in West-Bradley and SU vington, which being understood, we easily see why the Nomina Villarum of March, 1316, makes Thomas de Beysin joint Lord of Burwardsley (Shropshire) and Ashley (Staffordshire), and Lord of Church Eaton in the latter County; also why Alice de Beysin stands cotemporarily as Lady of Wyrketon, Billingsley, aud Sinerton (Sil vington), in Shropshire.135 On January 21, 1318, the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum issued, on the death of Thomas de Bey sin.136 It is needless to repeat the several particulars which the consequent Inquisitions reported, as to his various tenures at Ash ley, Wrickton, Walkerslow, Broseley, Billingsley, and Silvington. His Tenure in the latter would make it probable that he had suc ceeded his Mother there, while his holding only a third of Wrickton and Walkerslow would indicate that she was still living. His heb was his Brother Walter, born March 25, 1291, aud now twenty seven years of age. In May, 1324, Walter de Beysin, \" Man at Arms,\" was summoned from Shropshire to a Great Council at Westminster.137 It will explain many former allusions, as well as complete an interesting subject, if I give some account of this family of Beysin tiU the extinction of its nude line. \u2014 In January, 1343, a marriage was in contemplation between John, eldest son of Walter de Beysin and Margaret, daughter of Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh. The proposed Bridegroom was in his six teenth year, the Bride cannot have passed her twelfth. On Ja nuary, 26, 1343, the King orders inquiry to be made, whether it would injure the Crown if the King allowed Sir Walter de Beysin to give the Manors of Wrickton and Walkerslow to the said John and Margaret, \u2014 to hold to them and the heirs of their bodies, of 135 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 507.

The return to these Writs was favourable, and stated that, after the proposed transfers, no lands in either Shropshire or Staf fordshire would remain to Walter de Beysin.139 In the same year (1343) Walter de Beysin, and Alice his wife, seem to have con veyed two-thirds of the Manor and Advowson of Burwardsley to the same Henry de Mortimer, Senior, who resettles the premises by Fine ; \u2014 first, to the use of Walter and Alice for their lives ; then to John, son of Walter, and the heirs of his body ; \u2014 with remainder to the right heirs of Alice. As regards Wrickton and Walkerslow, it would appear that Walter de Beysin did not, as his License proposed, convey them at once to his son and that son's wife, but he granted forty merks annual rent, the issues thereof, to Sir Hugh de Mortimer, the Lady's Father. This was in trust, as a Deed of the said Sir Hugh, dated at Chelmarsh on March 31, 1343, sufficiently, shows.140 Thereby Sir Hugh grants that \"if his daughter, now wife of John de Beysin, die before she be twelve years of age, without issue of herself and the said John, the former grant of forty merks per an num shall hold good till Sir Hugh and his heirs should have raised a sum of 280 merks out of the Manors of Wrickton, Walkerslow, and Eynwode.\" This sum of 280 merks had probably been agreed upon as a provision for the marriage, and advanced by Sir Hugh ; for the Deed continues to declare that, if Margaret should live to attain the age of twelve years, the said grant to Sir Hugh should be void ; whUst, on the contrary, if she died within three years of the then present time, or at any period greater or less than three years, then whatever Sir Hugh should have received of the said rent of 40 merks should be reckoned in abatement of the debt of 138 Trustees evidently; the first, as I think, Uncle to the Bride (vide supra, Vol. Ill, p. 44). 140 Blakeway's MSS.

On November 20, 1344, Walter de Beysin was deceased, and the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum issued as usual. The Inqui sitions which followed U1 show us the result of the above and other settlements, which he had been busied in making. \" He held no thing in capite in Shropshire,\" and Wrickton and Walkerslow are not mentioned in the Inquests, \u2014 obviously because he died seized of no interest therein. As to Billingsley, it will have been settled like the two-thirds of Ashley before mentioned ; for the Inquest states that the deceased had held it for life, \" by concession of Henry de Mortimer, Senior, and Roger de Chillyngton, Chaplain,\" with remainder to John, son of said Walter, and to Margaret, wife of John, and the same further remainders as affected Ashley. The Suzerain of BUlingsley was now Edward Earl of Cornwall (The Black Prince). As to Broseley, the joint interest for life of the deceased and his wife, in certain lands and tenements there, is stated in the Inquest, which adds, that they were held of John de Eyton by a rent of 40c?., a circumstance which is partly explained by a Pedigree already given.142 The next remainder stated on the Inquest, viz. to John de Beysin and Margaret his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, is not quite equivalent to the Remainder covenanted in the Fine of 1343. As to Ashley, the Interest of the deceased was precisely as at Billingsley, and the Remainders were just what we should expect from the terms of the License sought in 1313. Church Eaton and Longnor had similarly been conveyed to Henry de Mortimer, Senior, as Trustee, and similarly reset tled.143 The deceased, said one Inquest, died on Nov. 15, 1344, and his son and heir John was eighteen years of age on Aug. 1, 1 344. Margaret de Mortimer, wife of John de Beysin, cannot have lived ten years after her husband's succession. She died without issue ; \u2014 otherwise an eventual coheirship, in the estates of Mortimer of Chelmarsh, would have remained for any descendants she may 1,1 Inquisitions, 18 Edw.

The latter remarried, but was deceased before August 25, 1360. The Inquests on his death mention his estates at Ashley, Water ton (Water Eyton, Staffordshire), Longnor (Staffordshire), Wrick ton, Walkerslow, Billingsley, Broseley, and also Melinghopc (Milli chope). His second wife, Anna, survived him. Elizabeth, his sole daughter and heir, was only five years of age on February 2, 1360.144 In this same year the King committed two-thirds of the lands of the deceased to Edmund, Earl of Arundel, till the heir should be of age, the said two-thirds being extended at \u00a315. 14s. \\6d. per annum.Ui I suppose the remaining third to have been the dower of John de Beysin's Widow, who appears to have been remarried to Thomas Latymer, while Elizabeth, sole heiress of the Beysins, be came in l\\69 the wife of Roger de Cherleton.146 Wrickton Chapel. \u2014 The only evidence which I have of this Foundation is the mention thereof, clearly as an affiliation of Stot tesden Church, iu the Deed of Bishop William de Vere, already quoted147 and shown to have passed between 1 186 and 1190. Tra dition seems to support the documentary evidence.148 NEWTON. When Earl Hugh de Montgomery gave two-thirds of his demesne of Neutone to Salop Abbey, there can be no doubt that Newton, near Stottesden, was the place indicated: but when, about 1138, Bishop Robert de Bettm confirmed to Salop Abbey two7thirds of the tithes of the Lord of Neutun, there may be a doubt whether Newton near Stottesden or Neenton was meant ; therefore we cannot cer tainly conclude, as in the case of Walkerslow, that before 1138 New ton was held by any Feoffee of the Lord of Stottesden. However I cannot doubt that a BaskerviUe was enfeoffed both in Newton and Northwood, either by Earl Hugh, Earl Robert, or King Henry I ; for it is clear that neither place came to the hands of King Henry II as part of his demesne of Stottesden, and any feoffment by King Stephen would have been set aside. I have spoken of the head branch of the Shropshire Baskervilles under Pickthorn and Alden ham. Pickthorn, though in another Domesday Hundred, stands 144 Inquisitions, 34 Edw.

Baskerville's feoffment therefore, in these two members of Stottesden, realized an estate, tolerably compact, though held under different Lords. As to Newton in particular, it occurs only as held by Under-Tenants of Baskerville : one of these we have already seen surrendering land in Pickthorn, and 9s. rent in Newton to Roger de Baskervibe, then (i. e. about 1242) Lord of both Manors.149 The Inquisition of Tenures in Stottesden Hundred, taken in 1255, says that New ton contained half a hide, which was held under Walter de Basker ville. The Fill did suit to the Hundred, and paid 2d. Stretward and 4d. Motfee.m Here, though the name of Baskerville's Tenant is not given, there is no doubt that it was Ralph Sprengehose, him self on the Jury which made the return. The same Ralph Spring tltose was a Juror for the Hundred at the Assizes of 1256, and occurs on other local Inquests in January, 1257, and December, 1259. At the Forest Assizes, February, 1262, half a merk was assessed upon the Bosc of Ralph Sprenghose, in Neuton, which had been long wasted *. it was within regard of Shirlot Forest. About five years later and we have Ralph Sprenchose attesting a Chetton Deed al ready set forth.151 In 1269 we have certain Under-Tenants in the neighbouring vill oi Charlcott possessed also of some interest in La Neuton.152 In 1292 a Cadet of the House of Baskerville seems to have been Under-Tenant here ; for the Stottesden Jurors presented at the As sizes how Thomas de Herefordshyre, having chaUenged Thomas de Baskerville of Neweton in the County Court for beating and maim ing him, and for breach of the King's Peace, had withdrawn his appeal on the third Court-day, and was since dead.153 The Accused was now found to have acted in self-defence.154 NORTHWOOD. The earliest document which bears upon Baskerville's feoffment in Northwood has been already quoted;155 but it indicates nothing more than that Thomas de Baskerville (the Cotemporary Lord of Pickthorn) was interested here.

The Stottesden Jurors spoke of Northwood nearly as follows: \u2014 \"Walter de Baskerville, son of Roger de BaskerviUe (which Walter is in custody of Sibil Gif fard by grant of the King) , is Lord (of Northwood) . Therein are six virgates of land; and he (Walter) should hold them of the King in capite. He does suit to the Hundred twice a year at the She riff's Tourn, but not to the lesser Hundred-Courts, because his (Walter's) Ancestors never did (the latter Suit). It pays 2d. for stretward and 4d. for motfee (the usual charge on two virgates, or half a hide) . Philip de Girros holds half a virgate of land for doing suit to the lesser Hundred-Court for the said vill.\"166 Sibil Giffard's Custody of Walter de Baskerville's lands has been set forth already in another place.157 Philip de Girros, the Under-Tenant named by the Stottesden Jurors, was himself of their number. He may pos sibly be identical with that Philip, son of Philip de Girros, whom we have spoken of as interested in Burwarton twenty -nine years earlier.157 At this time however (1255) the principal Tenant of young Wal ter de BaskerviUe at Northwood was Hugh de Baskerville : he was, I think, Son of Isolda or Hisota, Sister of that Thomas de Basker ville of Pickthorn who died in 1241 . He bore therefore his Mother's name ; but whereas we shaU see that both his Sisters, Juliana and Helewise, occasionally bore the name of Botterell, I think that Isol da's husband and Hugh's Father was a Botterell. We have heard of this Hugh de Baskerville under various circumstances and dates, ranging from 1241 to 1292,158 for I doubt not that the same person is indicated througho'ut. I now proceed to offer the documents which bear upon his tenancy in Northwood. About 1240, as I presume, \"Thomas de Baskerrille grants to Hugh de Baskervill and Marjory his wife that virgate in Northwood which Hisota, sis ter of the Grantor, held.\"159 The only Witness given for this Deed is Sir Roger de Baskerville, whom I presume to have been son and heir expectant of the Grantor, and, if I rightly fix the relations of the parties concerned, first Cousin of the Grantee. By another Deed, which I cannot- venture to date, Juliana Botterell grants (or quit-claims) to her Brother, Hugh de Baskerrille, that virgate in 169 Blakeway's MSS., whence also many of the Charters which I quote under Northwood are derived.

His great age, and the King's Patent twenty-five years before, will equally account for his Default. And within a year he died, though Margery, for fifty years his wife, survived him ; for in 21 Edw.

In Michaelmas Term, 1266, Isa bella, widow of William de Northwood, was suing Roger de North wood, Reginald de Cherlee (Chorley), Ralph de Arraz, John le Clerk, of Suthbury (Sidbury), Nicholas de Cherlee, Nicholas de Northwode, and Agnes le Warener, for her dower or thirds in several messuages or small parcels of land in Northwode.169 Soon afterwards Ema de Norwod is suing Hugh Peche (of whom we have heard before), under writ of mort d'ancestre, for half a virgate and seven acres in Norwood.169 About this time Emma Paen, of Nord wud (already mentioned), gives to John de Langeberge, Clerk, an acre in Nordwud, for half a merk paid down aud a \\d. rent. \u2014 Wit nesses : Nicholas le Forcer, Ralph de Lawa (The Low) and William his son, WiUiam de Stepple, John de Beaulieu (Bello loco), Hugh de Hwrthin.170 In June, 1269, Nicholas de Cherleye has a Writ of novel dis seizin against Ralph d'Arraz and Walter de Baskerville, concern ing a tenement in Stottesden; and in July following Hugh de Plessetis has a similar writ against Ralph d'Arraz, concerning a tenement in Norwode.171 The latter person was also concerned in a suit about land in Northwood, in 1270.173 The following deed must belong to the fifth year of Edward II 168 This Deed (among the muniments at Pitchford) is endorsed with a memo randum by Adam Otteley, of Pitcliford, stating himself to be kinsman and heir both of \"Roger Baskerville and William Pykethorn,\" mentioned therein.

In the year 1167 two parcels of land in Bardley seem to have become chargeable with an annual quit-rent to the Crown.174 It was the year when Alan de Nevill held a great Forest Assize in Shropshire, and I doubt not that it was that Justiciar who detected the liability of these lands to the said quit-rent. The Occupants of the lands, or their ancestors, had, I think, held them since the time of Henry I, otherwise, when Henry II gave Stottesden to Godfrey de Gamages, Bardley would have been involved in the gift, which it certainly was not. From and after the year 1167, the Sheriff of Shropshire (or at times the King's Escheator) accounts on the annual Pipe-Rolls for the quit-rents of these two parcels of land : he received 6s. per annum on one parcel and 3s. per annum on the other. Sometimes the Receipt is stated to be for lands in Stottes den, sometimes, and perhaps with a view to brevity rather than accuracy, it is classified under the heading of Escheats or Purpres tures. The specific situation of the lands, viz. Bardesley, is usuaUy given on the Pipe-Rolls. I propose to treat first of the greater of these parcels of land, which the Pipe-Rolls uniformly estimate as one virgate while other Records make it more. In one instance it is said to be four and a half virgates. This estate was held in capite by the Lords of Bad ger, the hereditary Foresters of Shirlot, a family which, as I have shown already,175 was represented by Philip fitz Stephen at the time 173 Blakeway (vide supra, Vol. I, p. 228, note 38). The original, among the Muniments at Pitchford, I have since seen : it confirms the accuracy of Mr. Blakeway's transcript ; but the date (1311) is undoubted. 174 Rot. Pip. 13 Hen.

The first positive mention of the Tenant in capite oi this virgate is in a Roll of Shropshire Serjcantries in 1211. Roger de Bageshour was then in possession thereof.176 Consistently with the known succession of the Lords of Badger, we learn from the Inquisition of Stottesden Hundred, in 1255, that \" Philip de Beggesoure holds in the Vill of Berdel four virgates of land in capite, paying 6s. annually at the Exchequer.\"177 The Inquisition, ordered Dec. 2, 1258, on the death of this Philip, puts his estate at Bardel' at 4| virgates; par- ticulars of his son's Livery thereof, in February, 1259, I have already given.178 In November, 1274, the Hundredal Inquest says, that Philip de Beggesovre holds 4\\ vngates in the vill of Berdeleg of the King in capite, paying 6s.179 The Feodary oi 1284 makes consistent mention of the Tenure, but the Inquisition on Philip de Badger's death, in 1291, gives fuller particulars, viz. tbat the de- ceased had \" held, in capite, 4\\ vfrgates in Bardeleg, not of the Crown, but of the King's Escheat, accruing by Robert de Beleem (Belesme) : and tbe land is of the Honour of Stottesden, and held by 6s. payable to the Sheriff, and it is a Socage, and is worth 50s. per annum.\"180 I now return to speak of another and smaller estate at Bardley, uniformly estimated on the Pipe- Rolls at half a virgate, but stated in other Records to have been five times that quantity. This was held by a family which took name from the place. The Tenant paid 3s. rent to the Sheriff, but there is a probability that a further service was attached to the Tenure. The first of this family whom I find mentioned is Richard de Berdeleg, who appears in October, 1199, as Recognizor in a Suit at Law, given under Clee St. Margaret.181 He was succeeded by William de Bardley, witness of a Middleton Prior's deed very early in the thirteenth century,162 and who, in 1211, is enrolled among those Shropshire Tenants by Serjeantry, whose duty it was to accompany the Sheriff when convey ing the Ferm of the County twice a year to the Exchequer. The Re cord then proceeds : \u2014 \" The aforesaid William de Berdeleg holds half a virgate of land, and pays annually 3s. by hand of the Sheriff at the 17si Ibidem, p. 70. 177 Rot. Bundred, II, 82.

Thomas has been already mentioned under another locality.185 He is entered on the Stottesden Hundred-Roll of 1255 as holding \" two vir gates in capite of the King, for which he paid 3s. at the Exchequer, but did no other service.\"186 His Serjeantry had probably been done away with. Again at the Assizes of 1272, Thomas de Bardeleye was a Juror for Stottesden Hundred, and the Inquisition of No vember, 1274, represents him as holding two and a half virgates in Berdeleg, of the King, in capite, and by a rent of 3s.187 On January 29, 1278, he was deceased, and the King's Writ of Diem clavsit extremum issued as usual on the death of a Tenant in capite.m The consequent Inquest reported his tenure as of two virgates, his rent as 3s., and the value of the said estate as 17s. 4d. Besides Bardley he had held two virgates of tbe Abbot of Wigmore, paying rents of 7s. and 1 lb. of pepper : also of the Abbot of Shrewsbury he had held 3^ virgates at 13s. 4d. rent, the full value being 20s. William, son and heir to the deceased, was upwards of fifty years of age,189 a fact quite consistent with the long period during which Thomas had been seized of his estates. William paid his relief in the same year.190 William de Bardley's surrender of his tenancy under Salop Abbey, at Prestcote, has already been given.191 The Feodary of 1284 gives his Tenure in capite as one carucate.192 At the Assizes of 1292 it appeared that much of this Tenure had been illegally alienated. The Stottesden Jurors, after presenting Thomas de Bardley's former tenancy as one carucate in Bardie and Henle, held in capite by 3s. rent, and being worth 20s. per annum, proceed to say that three acres thereof were now held by Robert de Dodyton, two acres by Roger fitz Agnes of Kynlet, eight acres by William Bryd, sixteen acres by Roger de Yatton, and as to what was in Henle, it was worth 5s. per annum, and Brian de Bromton held it all,\" not under Thomas de Bardley's heir, but under the King and over the said heir.

His Tenure in Balbeneye (Baveney), under Sir Henry de Ribbeford, was another matter. Though he cannot have been much less than seventy at his death, we find that Richard, his son and heir, was under two years of age at the same period, having been born May 1, 1293.19i This Richard seems to have died in 2 Edw. II (1308-9) .195 The Nomina Villarum oi 1316 gives the King as Lord of Bardelegh,190 but the reason of this I have yet to inquire. Chorley, Kingswood, and Woodhouse were members of Stot tesden, of which occasional mention occurs in ancient writings, but it is not clear whether they were members of the central Manor or of the detached Berewicks which we have been noticing. I have nothing to say of either, except to identify Roger de Bosco Regis (a Juror for Stottesden Hundred in 1274) 197 as the then Tenant of Kingswood, a vill which probably acquired its name when the whole Manor was in the hands of Henry I. i^arcott Tins place, though parochiaUy a member of Stottesden, was manorially distinct, even as early as the time of Edward the Con fessor.

To avoid repeating former statements, I pass to the year 1203, when Wilham, son of Geoffrey Carbunell,3 impleaded the third Robert Fitz Aer and his mother Emma for half a hide in Havercot, alleging that his said Father, Geoffrey, had been seized thereof. The result has been already given.4 In 1211 we have the first statement of the Serjeantry or service, by which this Robert Fitz Aer held Harcott. He was bound to find \" one serving foot-soldier, with a bow and arrows, to attend the King's army in Wales.\" 5 The death of this Robert Fitz Aer, and the succession and death of William Fitz Aer (whom I now find to have been Brother of Robert), have been before spoken of.6 The minority of John Fitz Aer, in 1255, is fully proved by the return of the Stot tesden Jurors as to Havekercot, of which \" John Fitz Cleri \" (read Aeri) was Lord, he being in custody of Philip le Bret, by grant of the King. The Jurors gave the contents of the Manor as half a hide, \u2014 \" held in capite of the King by service of one Serjeant, with a bow and three arrows, in Wales, when the King goes thither to levy war.\" The Vill did suit twice a year to the Sheriff's Tourn, but not to the Lesser Hundred Courts, nor to the County Court. It paid 2d. for Stretward, and id. for Motfee. The land, by tenure of which John Fitz Aer became a Ward of the Crown, was collec tively worth nine merks per annum.1 The Stottesden Jurors of 1274 repeated, in substance, the former statements as to the service by which John Fitz Aer held Havekercote.8 The Feodary of 12849 gives the same account as the Inquisition of 1255. It may lead to some further discovery, as to the relations of this John Fitz Aer, if I point out that he was in receipt of a large rent-charge from the Warwickshire Manor of Farnborough. His receipt of 100s. there of (apparently an instalment only) from Henry Marshall of Farn barwe, bears date 15 Edw.

It purports to be levied between Hugh le Fitz Aer, Plaintiff, and Henry le Waleys (a Trustee, I think), Deforciant, of a messuage, a carucate of land, and 100s. rent, in Criddon (Salop), and of _\u20ac10. rent in Franberew (Warwickshire) , which Hugh acknow ledges to be Henry's by his (Hugh's) gift, and whereof was plea of convention.

The names of Le Wafre, Baskerville, and Weldeb\u0153uf occur frequently in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in con nection with certain localities in Brecknockshire and Hereford shire. Tedston Wafre, in Herefordshire, was held by Le Wafre under Weldeb\u0153uf, and by Weldeb\u0153uf of the Honour of Brecknock. Again, one Robert le Wafre, about 1220, had to wife a Lady who was apparently a Baskerville. One or two quotations from the Charters of Brecknock Priory are relevant to the subject in hand. About 1200-1210, William de Weldebeof grants to that House \" the wood which belongs to the land, which was formerly Bernard Unspac' s,3 which passes from Brecon to Abreschir. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir Wilbam de Braose, Matilda his wife, William their heir, Robert Wafre.\" Between 1216 and 1222, a confirmation by Reginald de Braose is attested by Robert de Wafre, and, vice versa, Sir Reginald de Braose attests the Charter whereby \u2014 \" Robert le Wafre, with con sent of his wife Alice, eldest daughter of Roger de Baskerville, confirms to the Monks of Brecon the Mill of Landevaillane, which Ralph de Baskerville4 had first given them.\"5 The obit of Alice, wife of Robert le Wafre, was annually cele brated in Hereford Cathedral ; and it was their son, intimates my authority,6 another Robert, who, in 1243, is said to hold one hide in Thoddesthorne (Tedston), of John de Weldebef, of the Honour of Brecknock.7 Another, and nearly cotemporary Record, represents Robert le Wafre's Tenure in Tedethorn as immediate, under the Earl of Here ford, and by service of a fourth part of a knight's-fee.8 About this 3 We shall hear of Bernard Unspac again under Einlet. vary however so much from my transcripts of the same MSS. that I speak with some doubt on the subject. 4 This Ralph de Baskerville seems to be identical with the so-named Lord of Bradwardine and Pickthorn, of whom I have given account under the latter place (vol.

The period of this Robert le Wafre's death I am unable to ascertain, but he was living in 1265, after which he attests, as a Knight, a great Charter which Humphrey de Bohun (VII) expedited to Brecknock Priory.11 I imagine it to have been at least ten years later that Lucia, his sole daughter and heir, married to Roger, younger son of Roger Lord Mortimer, of Wigmore. The Feodary of 1284 teUs us ac cordingly, that \" Roger, son of Roger de Mortimer, holds Hopton Waffre of the Earl of Hereford, of the Honour of Brekeynoc, and the same Earl of the King in capite.\" 12 In 1285 I find that Roger de Mortimer presented, to Tedston-Wafre Church ;13 and on May 6, 1286, Roger de Mortimer of Chirk had a grant of Free- Warren in Hopton Waffre, as well as in six Herefordshire Manors, one of which was Todesterne?* In the Nomina Villarum of 1316,15 Roger de Mortimer is entered as Lord of Upton Wafre ; but I here quit a subject, for further details of which, as connected with the Baro nial House of \" Mortimer of Chirke,\" I may refer elsewhere.10 THE CHURCH.

I have a note of Ralph, Bishop of Hereford, having, in 1236, confirmed the Tithes of Hopton Wafre to Brecknock Priory.17 The Advowson however of Hopton Wafre belonged, before 1278, to the Abbot of Wigmore.

Analogy with cer tain other Manors in South Shropshire would induce me to think that Pantulf's interest here lapsed to Fitz-Alan, and that Ingwar dine was annexed to the Fees of De Hugford, that is, to those va rious estates which the latter held in Fitz Alan's Barony. What I have further to say of the place relates chiefly to its Under-Tenants. At Michaelmas, 1188, the Justices of the Forest had amerced Alexander de Ingwrdin 2s. for some default.4 This Alexander, whose real name was De Cauz, appears to have inhe rited Ingwardine from his elder brother Robert, who was deceased without issue in 1187, but who left a widow, Lucia. The said Lucia obtained, in 1187, by Suit-at-law, from Alexander, her late husband's brother, an assignment of dower in Ingwrdin. Her right was decided by a Jury, and embodied in a Chirograph or Fine, whereby Alexander warranted the premises to Lucia. In i. Ric. I (1189-90) a Claimant to the whole of Ingwardine rose up, in the person of Wil bam de Spineto. Suing Alexander de Ingwardine for the estate, he recovered it. A second Chirograph, between Alexander and Wil liam, embodied a quit-claim of the whole land of Ingwardine from the former to the latter ; and the former also gave sureties that he would convict tbe Jurors in the former trial of perjury, and so oust Lucia de Cauz of her dower. Without waiting for so formal a process, it appears that Wdbam de Spineto at once disseized the said Lucia. A Suit now sprang up between the latter parties. On Nov. 3, 1194, I find Lucia de Hingwordin essoigning her appear ance at Westminster in the said suit, by the essoign called de malo veniendi, her Essoignor being Richard Irish (Hiberniensis) . On November 28, 1194, however, she appeared in Court, having given security to show cause why she had sued William de Spineto under writ of novel disseizin. The said William now pleaded the Chiro graph of i. Ric. I. Lucia, on the contrary, relied upon that of 1187, and asked for judgment of the Court as to whether Alexan der de Ingwardine was competent to over-ride his first Fine by a second (utrum finem facer e potuit supra finem prius factam) . The Jurors, by whose verdict the first Fine had been levied, had it seems been bound over to appear at this They came, and so did Alexander de Ingwardine ; but instead of convicting them of per jury, he could allege nothing against them but the Chirograph or document itself. Lucia hereupon had sentence in her favour, viz. 4 Rot. Pip. 34 Hen. II, Salop."], [652, "190 INGWARDINE. \" that she should hold peaceably;\" and \" William\" (it should surely be Alexander) \" and his Sureties were in misericordid because he had not convicted the Jurors of perjury.\" 5 These details of one of the earbest lawsuits on any English Record have an interest of their own, though they concern but a part of a very small estate. To continue, \u2014 I find mention of one Robert de Ingwardine, as paying half a merk in 1199 for some withdrawal, \u2014 probably of a lawsuit.6 In 1221, we have already heard of a Wilbam de Ingwardine, accused of robbery;7 and in 1226 we have had mention of Alexander de Caus.7 The Hundred Roll of 1255 tells us, that Walter de Pedwrthin (Pedwardine) was Lord of Ingwrthin, but nothing as to the Seig noral Lord. It was a virgate of land (as at Domesday) , did suit to the Hundred (of Stottesden) twice a year, but not to the lesser Hundred Courts nor to the County Court. It paid the Sheriff Id. for Stretward and 2d. for Motfee? Of Walter de Pedwardine we shall hear again, in very different relations. At the Assizes of 1256, Wilbam le Venur and Loreta his wife were found to have disseized Robert de Hope of eight acres in In garton.9 In October, 1269, one Ralph Sprenchehose was suing Felicia, widow of another Ralph Sprenchehose, under writ of mort d'ancestre, for a messuage and noke in Ingworthyn. The suit is again mentioned in 1270.10 At the Assizes of 1272, Richard de Ingwrdin was a Juror for Stottesden Hundred. The Feodary of 1284 helps us to determine the true ratio in which this Manor was held : \u2014 \" Walter de Pede wardin held it of William de Hugford, the said Wilham of Richard fitz Alan and of the Honour of White-Minster, and the said Richard of the King in capite.\" \" Others, whom I have now to mention, were probably Pedwardine's Under-Tenants here, viz. Roger and Richard de Ingwardine, Jurors at Pickthorn in March, 1286, and again at Chetton in June, 1290; Richard de Ingwordine, a Juror at Brug in 1292 ;12 and Roger and Richard de Ingwrdin, Jurors at Cleobury North hi March, 1301.

It lies in Leominstre, the King's Manor in Herefordshire, and there it is valued.

(per annum) to the Central Manor. Whether the little which I have to say of Farlow belongs pro perly to a Shropshire History is hardly worth consideration. Domes day is the only Record which has placed it in a Shropshire Hundred, and that with the careful quabfication above set forth. Domesday being my Text-book, I woU therefore speak of Farlow as connected with, but not contained in, Shropshire. The first Lord of Farlow whom I can name after Domesday was one who, written as Phibp de Pharlawe, and being in November, 1194, a Recognizor in a trial about lands in Holicott, essoigns himself by Roger fitz Siward.3 This Phibp was, I doubt not, the same person with Phdip de Lin ley, Lord of Linley, who has already occurred to us in 1196 and 1200, in connection with that place.4 At the Assizes of October, 1203, we have him, as Philip de Fernlawe, amerced five merks for some transgression, and also as empannelled on a Jury with the principal Knights of Shropshire.5 Again, in April, 1206, we have him as a Juror of Grand Assize concerning land in Oxenbold ; and at the Shropshire Forest Assizes, in March, 1209, the Justices amerced him half a merk, as Surety of some one in Staffordshire.6 4 Supra, Vol. II, p. 40. 13 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 193. 1 Domesday, so. 259, b, 2. 5 Assizes, 5 John, m. 6 dorso and 4 2 Ibidem, so! 180, a, 1. 3 Rot.

Of this Wydo or Guy I have already said something,8 associating him, about 1230-1240, with the neigh bourhoods of Brockton and Farlow. An earlier occurrence in the latter connection is of date November, 1221, when one written as Wiard de Vuerlawe appears as Surety of WUliam Botterell (of Aston Botterell) . Of Philip, son and heir of Wydo de Farlow, I have spoken under Brockton.9 He was living in or about 1255, as we have seen under Stottesden.10 The following Deed must have passed within five years of that date. Thereby \" Roger de Pynelesdone grants to Robert de Harlegh, in frank marriage with Alice, his daughter, half a merk annual rent which WUliam de DonviU paid for a tenement held under the Grantor in the ViU of Farlawe : \u2014 Witnesses : Hugh de Legh, Andrew de WylUegh, Hugh BurneU.\"11 Hugh de Donvile, who was Fermor of Stottesden Hundred and Constable of Brug Castle in or before the year 1274, was associated with the neighbourhood of Farlow ; but with Farlow itself, or the above-named WUliam de DonvUl, I cannot connect him. That the same parties succeeded the Farlows at Farlow and at Brockton, a Fine of May 5, 1280, wiU clearly show, if compared with the two cotemporary Fines cited under Brockton.12 This third Fine purports to be levied between John de Cleton and Alice his wife, Plaintiffs, and MatUda, widow of Richard de Sutton,13 Impedient (by Hugh de Charlecote, her attorney), of half a carucate and 60s. rent in Far lawe and Lylleye (perhaps Linley), whereof was Plea of Warranty of Charter.

It is as follows : \u2014 \"The same Radulf de Mortemer holds Claiberie (of the King). Eddid held it (in Saxon times). Here are mi hides geldable. There is (arable) land (sufficient) for xxim ox-teams. In demesne are mi Teams, and xnn Serfs, xx Villains, a Priest, n Radmans, and vni Boors have, among them all, xx Teams. Here is a Mill ren deritig n horse-loads of corn : a wood, capable of fattening 500 swine, renders 40s. In time of King Edward, the Manor was worth \u00a38 (per annum) ; and afterwards its value was the same; now it is worth \u00a3\\2.\"x But further, \u2014 this value was inclusive of the three smaU estates of Melela (Mawley) , Lei, and Fech, which \" when Tur stin de Wigmore received them from Earl WiUiam, he joined to the superior Manor of Claiberie.\" It was also inclusive of Dodentone (now Earls Ditton), a small Manor, usuaUy accounted to be in Overs Hundred, but which, inasmuch as it is thus valued under Cleobury, Domesday would seem to classify with the latter Manor. When in the above and in other passages of Domesday, we read of certain Shropshire and Herefordshire Manors held by Eddid, or Eddied, in the days of the Confessor, we see at first nothing to ar rest the attention or call for remark. Yet to this Eddid attaches a story of the most romantic interest. We have before us the name of a Queen, \u2014 of Edith, the sister of King Harold, the unhonoured wife of King Edward himself.3 How it came to pass that Edith should be thus described as having singly held estates in her hus band's lifetime, I can only conjecture. It may be a feature of the estrangement which other Records show to have existed between the Royal pair, or these estates may have been hers by gift of her father, Earl Godwin. Of the treatment which Edith met with at the hands of WiUiam the Conqueror we know little. She died at Winchester, then a Royal Capital, on December 14, 1074, and was 1 Domesday, fo. 260, a, 1. 2 Domesday (fo. 183, b, 1) says oiLinte hale (a Herefordshire Manor of Mortimer), Eddied regina ienuit ; of Stoches it says, \u2014 Eddied Ienuit. Hence the Manor still bears the name of Stoke-Edith.

But whereas Edith's sympathies as a Queen had ever been shown on the side of her own family, rather than on that of Edward and his Nor man Favourites, it is very possible that this sumptuous funeral was a sequel to less considerate treatment on the part of the Conqueror. And here Domesday will furnish a specific fact, for it proves that Edith was not permitted to retain all, if any, of her estates. We can show this most satisfactorily in the case before us, for Domesday constructively tells us that the Conqueror had bestowed Claiberie and its adjuncts on Earl WiUiam, who in turn had enfeoffed Turstin de Wigmore therein. Now, as Earl WUliam, thus mentioned, was no other than Wilbam fifz Osborn, Earl of Hereford, and as WUliam fitz Osborn was slain in Flanders on Feb. 20, 1071, that is nearly three years before the death of Queen Edith, it follows that he oc cupied certain of her estates during her Use. And this leads to an other inference from Domesday. \u2014 As I have before pointed out, Earl William fitz Osborn was Lord of Wigmore, and built the Castle thereof.3 We now see that he was also Lord of Cleobury ; and these two estates were the principal of all the estates, in Herefordshire and Shropshire respectively, which were afterwards held in capite by Mortimer. I conclude that many other estates which Ralph de Mortimer held at Domesday, of the King, and in those two Counties, had been first Earl William fitz Osborn' s, had reverted to the King on the forfeiture of Earl Roger de Britolio in 1074, and had then been granted to Mortimer, as the Conqueror of Edric Sylvaticus and the King's ablest Lieutenant in the West. Again, it appears from Domesday that Turstin de Wigmore, though enfeoffed by Earl Wilbam in Cleobury, had been removed, we will not say deprived, by Mortimer. Under Mortimer he con tinued to hold elsewhere, as I shall have other opportunities of showing. Meanwhile Mortimer took Cleobury into his own de mesne. It became his chief residence in Shropshire, and as such it is the place under which we may most fittingly give account of the\u2014 BARONY OF MORTIMER. In several contradictory expressions of ancient Chroniclers we dis- 3 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 50."], [659, "195 BARONY OF MORTIMER. cern one uniform tradition and idea, viz. that the two Anglo-Norman Families of Warren and Mortimer were descended from a common Ancestor. An Antiquary of the present Century,4 having brought a mass of Charter-lore and consummate critical skill to bear upon the question, has not only verified the fact of this relationship, but in a great measure shown its mode. Gunnora, wife of Richard I, Duke or Count of the Normans, had a Brother Herfastus and seve- ral Sisters. Herfastus was Father of Osbern de Crepon, and Os- bem de Crepon was Father of that WiUiam fitz Osbern of whom we were just now speaking. On the other hand, a Sister of Gun- nora, marrying to some one, unnamed by the Chroniclers, became Mother of a daughter also unnamed, which daughter was wife of Hugh, afterwards Bishop of Coutances, and Mother by him of three Sons, Rodolf, Roger, and Godfrey. Of Rodolf and Roger we are to speak. \u2014 They must have been born before the year 990, when their Father's Episcopacy had commenced, and their Mother was inferentially deceased. The elder, Rodolf, was known as Rodolfus filius Episcopi and as Rodolf de Warren ; the younger, Roger, was similarly called at one time Rogerius filius Episcopi, at another \u2014 Roger de Mortemer. So then these two Brethren were Cousins in the second degree of affinity to Wilbam fitz Osbern on the one hand and to Robert (I) Duke of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror, on the other hand. The Fiefs of Rodolf de Warren and Roger de Mortemer were both in the Pays de Caux. The Ca put of Mortemer's Barony was at one time the Castle from which he took his name. It was situate at the source of the River Eaulne, and near this Castle, in tbe year 1055, Roger de Mortemer, com- manding on behalf of Wilbam Duke of Normandy, defeated the forces of Henry III of France, commanded by Ralph de Montdidier and others, and threatening to devastate Normandy. The French Count, Montdidier, feU into the hands of Mortemer, was confined for three days in the neighbouring Castle, and then released, with out the sanction of Duke William, and on the feudal pretext that Mortemer had sometime done homage to his captive. This homage seems to have been in respect of certain lands in the French diocese of Amiens, and there are reasons for thinking that Mortemer was not only the Vassal, but the Son-in-Law of Montdidier. His two- sided allegiance cost him dearly Duke William exiled him from 4 The late Thomas Stapleton, Esq.\u2014 See his Observations on the Rotuli Nor manni\u00e6 (Vol. II, p. cxix et seq.), and his Essay on the Pretended marriage of Wil liam de Warren, Earl of Surrey (Arch\u00e6o logical Journal, Vol. Ill, pp. 1-26)."], [660, "196 MORTIMER OF WIGMORE.

Normandy iu the first instance, and when ultimately he admitted him to reconciliation, he confiscated that Castle of Mortemer which had been the scene of his offence. More than thirty years after wards the Duke, then King of England, is represented by Ordericus as recounting these circumstances on his deathbed. The narration ends with the King saying that he gave the forfeited Castle to William de Warren, a kinsman (consanguineo) of Mortemer and a loyal youth (legitimo tyroni) . William de Warren, thus mentioned, was in fact Mortemer' s Nephew, the son of his Brother Rodolf. He accompanied Duke William to England in 1066, was made Earl of Surrey by William Rufus, and transmitted the Castle of Mortemer to his descendants as Caput of the Honour of Warren in Normandy. Roger de Mortemer, recovering the other lands of his Fief, chose the Castle of St. Victor en Caux as the Capiut of his Norman Barony. It is not quite clear who represented the House of Mor temer at the so-called Battle of Hastings in 1066. The great age of Roger de Mortemer, though he survived that event at least eight years, must place his name out of the question. The Wigmore Annalist, whose inaccuracies I have before adverted to,5 makes Ralph de Mortemer to have been not only present at, but the prominent hero of Duke William's achievement ; but the fact can hardly be concluded from this testimonial of a later age. On tjie other hand, at a date shortly preceding the Conquest, we find William and Hugh mentioned as the sons, and apparently the eldest sons, of Roger de Mortemer and Odain his wife.6 And in very sufficient harmony with this evidence, Mestre Wace, living in the first half of the twelfth century, gives \u2014 Hue de Mortemer as one of the Chieftains at Hastings.7 The eventual Successor to Roger de Mortemer in Normandy was un questionably \u2014 Ralph de Mortemer, the Domesday Baron : and this Ralph I should have taken to be Son of Hugh and Grandson of Roger on chronological grounds, did not an authority, to which I defer, name him as Roger's son.8 Roger de Mortemer, I should now observe, was living in 1074, when, with Haduisa his wife, he procured the Priory of St. Victor en Caux, previously a cell to the Abbey of St. Ouen at Rouen, to be itself erected into an Abbey. Whether 6 Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 36, 37. 6 Arch\u00e6ological Journal, III, 13. 7 Roman de Ron (by Edgar Taylor, Author's criticism on Wace seems to be unfounded. 8 Rotuli Normanni\u00e6, II, cxx, note.

It is con jectured that with Hawise Roger de Mortemer obtained lands in the Diocese of Amiens, and it was on Ralph, as son, I presume, of Hawise, that those lands afterwards devolved. The forfeiture of Earl Roger de Bretolio in 1074 and the reduction of Edric Sylva ticus (events which must have been nearly cotemporary) placed large estates in Shropshire and Herefordshire at the redisposal of King William I, and, as I have before suggested,9 Ralph de Mor timer, as the antagonist of the said Edric, acquired a Fief in those Counties, which Fief he held in capite at Domesday. Of the Manors which he held under Earl Roger de Montgomery a nearly similar account has to be given. \u2014 In many of these his predecessor had been Edric Sylvaticus. Ralph de Mortimer too was related to Earl Roger much in the same way as he was related to the King ; for as King William was Great- Grandson of the Countess Gunnora, so were Earl Roger and Ralph de Mortemer respectively descended from two Sisters of that Countess. But there is a circumstance connected with Mortemer's tenure under the Norman Earls, which, though I learn it only from tra dition, is so corroborated by other evidence, and throws such light upon an obscure passage of English History, that I cannot but ac cept it as partially true. In the commencement of the fourteenth century a local Jury declared that Mortemer \" held the Manor of Cleobury Mortimer of the King in capite, as of the Escheat of Robert de Belesme formerly Earl of Salop, by service of being Seneschal of the said Earl in regard of all the said Earl's lands in Shropshire, and also by service of being Custos of the Castle of Bruges,\" and each succeeding Mortemer was bound to pay \"a relief as for one Knight's Fee, viz. a relief of 100s.\"10 Now it is not true that Mortemer thus held Cleobury, for it had never been of the Seigneury of the Norman Earls, and therefore could not be of Earl Robert's Escheat. Nor yet is it true that Mortemer held Cleobury by service of being Castellan of Bruges, for Cleobury was Mortemer's before the Castle of Bruges was built or even pro jected. But I have no doubt that what Ralph de Mortemer did hold in Shropshire under Earl Roger was by service of being his Seneschal, a service which, on the subsequent foundation of Brug Castle by Earl Robert, may have been construed to involve the custody of that Fortress. I shall have future reason to recur to ' Vide supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 49, 50. | -<\u25a0 Inquisitions, 32 Edw. I, No. 63."], [664, "200 CLEOBURY MORTIMER. this subject, but the very next fact which, after Domesday, occurs in the life of Ralph de Mortemer, is, from the way in which it is related, apposite to the idea of his Seneschalcy : I speak of the rebellion against William Rufus as described by Florence of Wor cester.11 He tells us how Bernard de Newmarch, Roger de Lacy (who had already invaded Hereford), and Ralph de Mortemer, joint Conspirators, with the Vassals of Earl Roger of Shrewsbury and a great army of Normans and Welsh, proceeded to threaten Wor cester. The order in which the rebels are mentioned seems to associate Mortemer with Earl Roger's Vassals. The Earl himself, though he secretly fomented the insurrection, is said to have taken no prominent part therein. In the next year (1089) we find Ralph de Mortemer among those Normans who garrisoned their Castles north of the Seine in support and at the cost of William Rufus.13 There is no evidence that Mortemer's tenure under the Earls of Shrewsbury, whatever was its nature, involved him in the rebellion of Robert de Belesme. As to the custody of Brug Castle, Belesme certainly entrusted that \\o others, and during the rest of Henry I's reign, whatever we know of Brug Castle favours the idea that it was in custody of the Viceroy or Sheriff of the County. In 1104, two years after Belesme's expulsion, Ralph de Mortemer was in Normandy, and one of those zealous partisans of Henry I who received the King on his visit to the Duchy, and participated in his designs on his Brother's Crown.13 And this is perhaps the latest authentic notice which we have of Ralph de Mortemer ; for though the Wigmore Annalist has inferentially represented him as General of King Henry's forces at Tenerchebray in 1106, and as the Captor of Courteheuse, the story is not worth a moment's con sideration, seeing that Ordericus not only omits all mention of Mortemer on that occasion, but contradicts the Wigmore story in every essential particular. The name of Ralph de Mortemer's wife, as we learn from competent authority, was Melisendis,14 but we know not who she was and only that her husband survived her. I have before alluded to the name, and the impossible parentage which the Wigmore Annalist has foolishly assigned to the wife of\u2014 Hugh de Mortemer, son and heir of Ralph.15 Of the early career of this Hugh we have no particulars, and there is a general probability that the Wigmore Annalist is right in representing 11 Florence Wygorn : II, 24. *9^Q0fricus, p. 681 A.

During the Usurpation of Stephen he comes first under notice. There can be little doubt that the Patent by which Stephen gave the Earldom of Hereford to Robert de Bossu, already Earl of Leicester, passed in 1140. That Patent mentions Hugh de Mortemer first of those Barons of Herefordshire, whose feudal subjection to the proposed Earl was not guaranteed by Stephen, but apparently reserved, sine medio, to the Crown.16 The private feuds of that period must not always be construed, to imply the political leanings of the parties concerned. What we hear of Mortemer's sympathies and anti pathies would of itself favour rather than disprove the idea that he was a partisan of Stephen. His subsequent conduct leaves little doubt on the point, and therefore it will be interesting to trace those previous symptoms of a political faith, which on the succes sion of the lawful heir to the Crown, drew Mortemer into wild and arrogant rebellion. In 1142-3 (no more probable date can be assigned to the circumstance) Robert de Betun, Bishop of Here ford, took refuge with the Canons of Shobdon, who at the time were under the protection of Mortemer and his Steward, Oliver de Merlimond, whilst Milo, Earl of Hereford, the strenuous partisan of the Empress, was the person from whose antagonism the Bishop fled. Then again in 1143 Oliver de Merlimond, disgraced and persecuted by Mortemer, betook himself to the same Earl Milo, who sheltered and befriended him. Mortemer's Feuds with Roger Earl of Hereford, son and heir of Milo, are broadly spoken of, but with no specific date or circumstance. Earl Roger was uniformly a friend to the cause of legitimacy till it had triumphed in the accession of Henry II. Then Earl Roger fell off, but in this in stance he appears to have acted in concert with Mortemer. Lastly we observe that Hugh de Mortemer had great Feuds with Joceas de Dinan, Lord of Ludlow, and, as the story goes, was waylaid and imprisoned by him till he paid a ransom of 3000 merks. Co temporarily the Chief of the House of Lacy was on terms of inti macy with Mortemer, and the feud and the friendship were natural consequences one of the other ; but I know not of any political bearing which can be attributed to these circumstances. They happened at a time (between 1148 and 1153) when political par tisans are not easily distinguished, and, as between Lacy and Dinan, it is an ulterior question which was the Legitimatist. For all the minute details which fill up this outline, and of 16 Duncumb's Herefordshire, I, 232. iv. 26"], [666, "202 CLEOBURY MORTIMER. which I am giving a criticism rather than a summary, I refer else where.17 Meanwhile it is well to observe how exactly the pro gressive character of Hugh de Mortemer tallies with what we should expect of the youth and manhood of a feudal Chieftain circumstanced as he was. At first on his succession we have him devoted to his pleasures and amusements, delegating all weightier concerns to his Steward, Oliver de Merlimond, particularly leaving to that functionary the execution of a pious work (the foundation of a Monastery), which was, as it were, a legacy from his Father. Then we have him active in private feuds or political combinations, successful in arms against the Welsh, making their Chieftains prisoners and founding Castles within their territory.18 At length, blinded with ambition or arrogance, he refuses to do homage to Henry II, and within a few months of that Prince's accession has fortified the three Castles of Brug, Cleobury, and Wigmore in de fiance of the Crown. When we look at the names of those who rallied round the Throne on this occasion, we have the fullest assurance of the insanity of Mortemer's rebellion ; but his parti cular conduct in defending Brug, a Royal Castle, against the King himself, though at first sight it strikes us as the very summit of audacity, may perhaps be partially explained. Stephen had pro bably permitted Mortemer to assert his traditionary office of Se neschal over the Royal Demesnes of Shropshire. That office, in the absence of the hereditary Sheriff, Fitz-Alan, had given to Mortimer the custody of Brug Castle. On the accession of Henry II, all his Predecessor's dealings with Royal Demesnes were brought in question, and generally reversed. It was therefore the command of Brug Castle which was disputed between the young King and his Vassal. Tbe sequel has been narrated already,19 and it remains to recapitulate the one circumstance which is most pertinent to our present subject, viz. that, according to the best account of Mortimer's20 rebellion, Cleobury was the first of his three Castles which was taken, and the only one which was de stroyed. The surrender of Brug Castle was followed, in July, 1155, by what the Chroniclers describe as the \"settlement of \" Monasticon, VI, 344-350. History of Ludlow (by Thomas Wright, Esq.), pp. 102-132. 20 It is not from mere caprice that I here turn to the English mode of spelling this name. It seemed proper to use the original Norman form Mortemer while dealing with the antecedents of the family. . 18 Vide Powel, sub anno 1143, and Monasticon, VI, 3 lit. 13 Supra, Vol. I, p. 248 et seq."], [667, "203 BARONY OF MORTIMER. the King's peace with Mortimer.\" The terms of the treaty are nowhere given, but the expression quoted indicates, I think, a very large consideration shown by the King for some prescriptive or hereditary claims of the late Rebel, other than the custody of Brug Castle. This introduces a further and very interesting ques tion. \u2014 Mortimer had lost both the name and office of Seneschal of Shropshire. By that office probably, and by no other service, had his Father held his Barony under the Norman Earls. What ever in Shropshire had been held by his Father of the King, had probably during the reign of Stephen been incorporated with the Tenure by Seneschalcy, and we consequently never hear at any subsequent period that Mortimer's Shropshire Barony was divided as to its mode of Tenure. The question then is this, \u2014 Did this office of Seneschal confer certain privileges and immunities? \u2014 and if it did, were those privileges, or some of them, secured to Mortimer long after his office had vanished except as a Legend ? This inquiry will best be met by some observations drawn from the public Records of the century and half which followed Morti mer's rebellion. During that period died five Chiefs of the House of Mortimer, and there were consequently five successions to its Honours. la no instance, except the fifth of these, do I find any record of a Writ of Diem clausit extremum having issued, or an Inquest having been taken as to Mortimer's Shropshire Barony. The exceptioual case, that of 32 Edw. I (1304), shall be considered in its place. Of Reliefs paid by succeeding Mortimers I will also speak in due order. I now notice a second appearance of immu nity. It is true that Mortimer's Shropshire Fief was reputed to contain a certain number of Knight's-fees, but that seems usually to have affected only the relations between the Baron and his Vassals. Mortimer owed no military service to the Crown for his Shropshire Fees. Hence in the Liber Niger, which purports to be a return of the Knights'-fees then (1165-6) composing each Ba- rony in the Realm, we find no return by Mortimer of Wigmore ; nor was this an accidental omission, for his Barony is not, like that of Mortimer of Richard's Castle, summarily described in any of those entries which form the supplementary portion of the Liber Niger?1 Consistently with all this, we find that the Shropshire Barony of Mortimer of Wigmore was never except once put in charge to a Scutage, and never except once put in charge to an Aid, during the whole period of which I speak. The exceptional \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Vide supra, Vol. I, p. 3."], [668, "204 CLEOBURY MORTIMER. instances were a Scutage and an Aid, which involved many other such anomalies. On the whole then it may be stated that Mor timer's Barony, in respect of certain immunities, stood alone among the Baronies of Shropshire ; and if the reason of this has not been suggested above, I know not where to look for it. I now return to give further particulars of Hugh de Mortimer and his Successors, but in so doing shall confine myself to matters hitherto unnoticed or misapprehended. In 1162 the Sheriff of Staffordshire answered for the Danegeld assessed on Mortimer's lands in Warwickshire, Leicestershire,\" and, I presume, Stafford shire, but it does not appear that his Shropshire estates were as sessed. In 1176 the Sheriff of Shropshire records against him a debt of .\u20ac307. 18*., the balance apparently of a debt which had been previously charged in the Hampshire Pipe-Roll. He also now owed tl?e King \u20ac100., \u2014 an amercement of which this was the ground. Mortimer had seized the working cattle (averia) of one of his Knights. The latter had apparently appealed to the King, who ordered Mortimer to restore them, taking Surety for whatever claim he might have on his Vassal. Mortimer refused, and the King sentenced him thus heavily. In 1177 Mortimer paid the small instalment of 18s. 9d. on his Hampshire debt, which also ap pears to have been an amercement. The balance of this debt and the whole of the other were charged against Hugh de Mortimer on the successive Pipe- Rolls of Herefordshire and Shropshire till his death. They were then charged on Roger, his son and heir ; but in 1184 I find that the Sheriff of Herefordshire had orders to respite the debt of \u20ac100. till the King should return to Eng land. However, no formal acquittance of either debt appears on any later Roll, nor more than a small instalment of either was ever paid. In 1201 \u20ac403. 16*. Id. is still charged in Berkshire against Roger de Mortemer for the \" misericordia of his Father.\"33 Leaving this instance of Feudal independence, I return to another subject. \u2014 The Annalist, already quoted, dates the completion of Hugh de Mortimer's Foundation of Wigmore Abbey in 1179 ; and gives the Founder's death as having taken place on Feb. 26, 1185. The latter date is probably four years too late, and the work of piety was ac cordingly a closing act in Mortimer's life. It was in the year 1181 that his debts to the Crown were first charged against his Son 23 Rot. Pip. 8 Hen. II, Legrecestrescir' I 23 Rot. Cane. 3 John, p. 258. et Warewichscr'."], [669, "205 BARONY OF MORTIMER. Roger. We may therefore place Hugh's death as on Feb. 26, 1181, seeing that the anniversary observed by Wigmore Monastery would probably be a safe guide as to the day, rather than the year, of the Founder's obit. There is a French Chronicle of the Mortimers, which I have often quoted, and which seems to be a much more authentic document than the Latin Historia Fundationis. This French Chronicle seems to intimate that at the time of Hugh de Mortimer's death, his son Roger was the Prisoner of Henry II, be cause of the death of one Cadwallan, whom Roger's attendants had killed. So, continues the Writer, \" the King's Servants held the Castle of Wigmore with its appurtenances.\" He then proceeds to describe the miraculous escape of some Welsh prisoners from the Castle, and, after that, Roger de Mortimer's enlargement from cus tody and return to Wigmore.24 We have the means of verifying the non-miraculous part of this narrative in a most satisfactory way. \u2014 The Sheriff of Shropshire accounting at Michaelmas, 1181, charges himself with a sum of \" \u20ac16. Is. 9d. of the issues of the land of Hugh de Mortimer, for the term wherein it was in the King's hand. He (the Sheriff) had paid \u20ac14. into the King's Treasury ; he had expended \u20ac2. Is. 9d., by the King's order, in maintenance of Hugh's hounds and hawks previous to the time when the King took possession of them. And he (the Sheriff) was quit.\"35 The term here spoken of must be taken to have been half a year. At the same time (Michaelmas, 1181) the Sheriff of Here fordshire is charged \"\u20ac8. Os. 10c?. for the fixed rent (de redditu statuto) of the land of Roger de Mortimer in his Bailiwick, viz. for one term, and according to the Sheriff's own asseveration.\" The one term here spoken of must be a quarter of a year, for the Sheriff of Herefordshire, iu 1182, is again charged with a similar sum of \u20ac8. Os. \\0d. on the same account, but for a quarter of a year. On the whole the accounts of the two Sheriffs (of Shropshire and Herefordshire) tally, though one describes the escheated estate under the name of the deceased Father, the other under the name of the succeeding Heir ; one reckons the half-year of forfeiture in gross, the other in distinct quarters, and with less punctuality. Again I should observe that in 1182 the Sheriff of Herefordshire, balancing his account for the year 1181, is allowed a sum of money 24 History of Ludlow, p. 124. sauro \u00a314.

He had probably taken an active part on the King's side in the rebellion of 1173-4, for in the latter year the Sheriff of Shropshire paid to Roger de Mortimer \u20ac8. 13s. 4d. out of the ferm of the King's Manor of Halis (afterwards Hales Owen), in obedience to the King's order. This grant appears as equivalent to \u20ac16. 16s. 8d. in the year 1175, and to \u00a316. per annum in 1176, 1177, 1178, and 1179. In 1180 it is suspended and does not again appear, a circumstance which would seem to fix the date of Roger de Mortimer's disgrace as about Michaelmas, 1179. The Worcestershire Pipe-Roll of that year verifies this conclusion, and gives a further instance of the King's previous favour. It assigns to Roger de Mortimer, as usual, fifty Librates of Crown land in Merlega and Bremesgrava as a Royal gift, but yet at the moment of completing the account these lands were in the King's hand. The Sheriff accounts \u20ac4. 13s. 6d. for the issues of Roger de .Mor timer's lands, and \u20ac4. 17s. 9^. which was found upon the person of Simon de Ribbeford, his Dapifer or Seneschal, \u2014 both baring been arrested, I presume. It is very satisfactory to find that the results thus arrived at, from collating a monastic Chronicle with the Re cords of the Exchequer, are confirmed by more general history. Diceto actually gives the day (September 22, 1179) when Cadwallan, a Prince of South Wales, was waylaid and murdered in returning from the King's Court, and whilst under the King's guarantee of safe-conduct. Diceto tells us of the hatred and fear which existed between Cadwallan and the English ; also how his murderers were punished. Some, who were proved guilty, were put to the rack, and forfeited all their worldly possessions ; others, who were suspected, were forced from the pale of society -?7 but Diceto does not tell us who was the principal offender, nor how he suffered two years' for feiture and imprisonment. The Wigmore Annalist has given to 26 Powel (sub anno 1142) says, that Mehenyth was conquered and Castle Cy maron fortified by Hugh (Ranulph is \"of Castle Cymaron to- Roger de Morti- mer. 2* Diceto, p. 607.\u2014 meant) Earl of Chester.

Again, Powel (sub anno 1194) attributes the conquest of Melyenyth and the building The Sheriff of Herefordsliire, in 1179, charges 2\u00a3 merks for taking the prisoners who were accused of tho death of Cadewill to the Court at Windsor, and to Worces ter, as the King had ordered."], [671, "207 BARONY OF MORTIMER. Roger de Mortimer two wives, \u2014 the first, Milesaunt, daughter of the Earl of Derby ; the second, Isabella, daughter of the Lord de Ferrers, of Lechlade. It has been suggested, if not shown, by the keen-sighted Antiquary, whose criticisms I have been largely appro priating,38 that this alleged first wife is probably imaginary, her Christian name being borrowed from that of Roger de Mortimer's Grandmother, her relationship to the Earl of Derby being a con fusion with Mortimer's wife, Isabella, who was a Ferrars. The French Chronicle, so often quoted above, is again in this instance a faithful Record, for it mentions only one wife of Roger de Mortimer, viz. Isabel de Ferrars, of Lechlade. Of Roger de Mortimer, during the eventful reign of Richard I, English Records speak but little. The Welsh Chronicles, with an inconsistency already pointed out, represent him to have conquered that part of Radnorshire called Melyenyth, and to have built Castle Cymaron in 1194.29 We also learn from the same authority (and in this instance the story is corroborated by other evidence) that within the next two years Roger de Mortimer and Hugh de Say (Lord of Richard's Castle) suffered a signal defeat under the walls of Radnor Castle, and at the hand of Rees, Prince of South Wales.30 The events which followed the Coronation of King John were emphatically calculated to give prominence to the names of such English Barons as held large Fiefs in Normandy. Mortimer had estates in not less than thirteen English Counties, to say nothing of his acquisitions in Wales. In Normandy his Honour of St. Victor-en-Caux may be estimated by the fact that it owed the ser vice of five knights to the reigning Duke, while thirteen and a half knights' -fees represented that portion of the Fief which owed ser vice to the Lord Mortimer as distinct from the Ducal Suzerain.31 In King John's contest with Philip Augustus, Roger de Mortimer seems uniformly to have adhered to the cause of the former, and to his own English interests. In 1201 King John's second Scutage was levied for the Army of Normandy. Roger de Mortimer was not assessed thereto in respect of his Shropshire Barony, but in six other Counties he was assessed in the first instance, and excused by Writ-Royal in the next. On April 1, 1202, I find him in King John's retinue at Montfort sur Rile, and about the same time he acquired, by discharging a mortgage thereon, an estate which was 28 Stapleton (Rot.

On July 8 and 11, 1202, King John, then at Bonport, procures two loans of \u20ac100 (Anjovin) each, for the use of his \" faithful and beloved\" Roger de Mortimer, the King himself covenanting to see to the repayment thereof.33 On February 5, 1203, the King, at Rouen, cancels a debt of \u20ac25 (Anjovin) which was the interest accruing on a prin cipal debt of \u20ac100, due from Roger de Mortimer to certain Jews.34 In 1203 (if was the very year in which King John lost Normandy) , the fourth Scutage of his reign was assessed on the Tenants-in capite of Shropshire. Mortimer's Barony was in this instance as sessed as owing the service of five knights' -fees, and on that assess ment was paid the proportionate scutage of ten merks.35 The revolution which deprived Roger de Mortimer of his Nor man Fief had among its indirect results the augmentation of his English estates. His wife Isabel was the daughter of Walcheline de Ferrars, Lord of Ferrieres in Normandy, also of Oakham (Rut landshire) and Lechlade (Gloucestershire) in England. Walcheline de Ferrars left two sons, Henry and Hugh. On Henry, as the eldest, devolved the Norman Fief of Ferrieres, as well as the bulk of the English estates. To Hugh, the youngest, Walcheline gave Lechlade and Langeberge (Longborough) in Gloucestershire. The Lord of Ferrieres, on the rupture between France and England, sided with Philip Augustus, and so lost his estates on this side the Channel. His brother Hugh, Lord of Lechlade, had good cause for a different choice. He had married Margaret de Say, in whose right he held the great Fief of Richard's Castle. This Hugh de Ferrars died, without issue, about the mouth of August, 1204. His elder Brother was excluded, as an Alien, from all claim on his pa ternal inheritance. No such disqualification attached to his Sister Isabel. Hence, about August, 1204, we find that \" Ysabell de Mor timer gives the King 300 merks and one Destrier to have seizin of the Manors of Lechelade aud Langeberge, which were Hugh dc Ferrars, her brother's, by gift of their Father, Wakeline, whose heir she asserts herself to be ;\u2014 so however as that she will stand to trial about the premises if any one shall choose to sue her for the same.\" King John ordered security to be taken for this Fine, and seizin to be given to Isabel.

Roger de Mortimer \" being in Normandy to defend to the best of his power the rights of John, King of England, as was the custom of his Ancestors, was taken prisoner by the King of France in an engagement where the odds were a hundredfold against him.\" This story the Annalist tells of Ralph de Mortimer, second son of Roger, dating it in 1221, and yet in the time of King John who died in 121 6.43 On June 12, 1207, we find Roger de Mortimer again in England, and apparently having custody of Knighton Castle, a trust which the King orders him to surrender to Robert de Sireford as Bailiff of Thomas de Erdinton, the newly appointed Castellan.43 It was apparently in September, 1207, that Roger de Mortimer and Ysabella his wife gave the King a fine of 700 merks and seven Palfreys to have possession of the Rutlandshire Manor of Oakham.44 The na ture of Isabella's title to this estate has been already indicated. On November 27 the King extends the terms at which this Fine was primarily covenanted to be discharged.45 A Roll of Shropshire Tenures, which I date in the year 1211, enters Roger de Mortimer as a Baron holding in capite of the King by service of five Knights.46 This I take to be a general expression, indicating little more than \u00ab\u25a0 Claus.

Mortimer's service in the King's army under any general summons may possibly have been that of five Knights, and the only Scutage ever assessed on Mortimer in Shropshire was on such a basis ; but I think that both the service of five knights and the said scutage were exacted from him as a Baron of the Realm and in regard of his tenures in aggre gate, not with reference to his Shropshire Fief individually. In May 1213 we have Roger de Mortimer named as one of the twelve Barons who stood sponsors for the good faith of King John, then soliciting the return of Archbishop Langton to England.47 It was apparently about this time that Mortimer and his wife proffered some enormous fine for the custody of the lands, and marriage of the heir, of William de Beauchamp of Elmley. On November 20, 1213, the Barons of the Exchequer are ordered to respite some in stalment of this Fine.48 Its amount may be gathered from the fact that*in June 1214, \u20ac1011. thereof was still in arrear. The heir whose wardship Mortimer thus obtained is variously named Wili kin, or Walcheline, or Walter de Beauchamp, and he seems to have married a daughter of his Guardian. The last that I hear of Roger de Mortimer is his quittance in May 1214 of the scutage of Poitou, because his son was personally serving in that Province.49 It ap pears that, finding his end approaching, he sent to King John (then in Poitou) and requested that Monarch's assent to his wish of re signing all his estates to the use of his Son. This assent seems to have been given, and Roger de Mortimer died on June 24, 1214, if we accept the day of his obit, as recorded by the Wigmore Annalist and at the same time correct by a year the date of 1215 furnished by the same authority. In harmony with this amended date we find that between June 26 and July 8, 1214, the Letters-Close oi Peter, Bishop Winchester, then Viceroy of England, speak of Isa bella de Mortimer as a Widow. These Letters, addressed to the Sheriffs of more than twenty Counties (Shropshire included), order that as soon as the said Isabella shall have been certified by the Barons of the Exchequer to have paid 500 merks of the \u20ac1011. which were in arrear of the Fine for Beauchamp's heir, then that those Sheriffs should put Isabella in seizin, both of her own inhe ritance, her dower out of Mortimer's lands, and the whole of Beau champ's estates.50 There is a Letter of King John dated at La Ro chelle, July 10, 1214, instructing his Viceroy as to certain steps to \u00ab Rot.

It is obvious from the terms of this Letter that the King had not heard of Mortimer's death ; at the same time the surveillance which the Viceroy is empowered to exercise is in perfect consistency with the idea that the King had been apprised of Mortimer's failing energies.51 A second Letter of the King to his Viceroy, dated at St. Maixent on July 19, indicates that news of the Baron's death had reached the Court, and more over that the King had completed an understanding with Mor timer's Widow, whereby the latter was still to have custody of Beauchamp's heir.63 About the same time but certainly before Au gust 5, 1214\u2014 Hugh de Mortimer, son and heir of Roger, being in Poitou as I have said, proffered to the King a Fine of 500 merks that he might have all those lands and tenements \" of which his Father had been seized on the day when he was first attacked with that sickness, under stress of which he had sent to the King, asking the King's assent to resign them to his Son.\" The King acquiesced. His Pre cept to the Bishop of Winchester orders that, security being taken for the said Fine, Hugh shall have instant seizin of the aforesaid lands, and if the deceased \" after the day specified had given or in any other way alienated ought, save only with his own body (in burial),\" Hugh should have restitution thereof.53 A similar Precept to the Sheriff of Shropshire mentions Hugh's Proctor as the person to be put in seizin.54 Writs of the Viceroy, dated August 5, 1214, iutimate to the Sheriffs of Herefordshire and four other Counties that they are to give the seizin in question when they hear from the Sheriff of Shropshire that he has got the required security.55 A King's Writ to the Viceroy, dated August 19, allows that all receipts from the lands of Mortimer and Beauchamp, which had accrued while the said lands had been in manu Regis, should be allowed in abatement of the Fines of Hugh and his Mother Ysabella re spectively.56 Before I continue my account of Hugh de Mortimer, I should state that his Mother Isabella became the second wife of Peter fitz Herbert, whom, as well as her two sons, she survived. She enjoyed the Barony of Walcheline de Ferrars her Father for life, and en deavoured to settle Lechlade on her Grandson Roger de Mortimer ; but at her death, about 1252, the King seized on these estates, and 53 -54 Rot.

Isabella it would seem was not the heir of Ferrars of Oakham, and though she had been allowed to hold the Barony as the sole denizen representative of the family, her tenure was not in fee, but ouly at will of the Crown. To the King then, after her decease, these lands reverted as an Eschaeta de terris Nor mannorum?7 Hugh de Mortimer, at the time of his Father's death, was serving King John in Poitou, but Hugh's wife Annora was, at the same time, in one of the King's English Prisons. She was a daughter of that ill-fated House of Braose which afforded so many victims to the unrelenting hatred and cruelty of John Plantagenet. The King returned from Poitou in October, 1214, and being at Windsor on the 27th, ordered the liberation of this Lady, in de- ference to the prayer of Nicholas, the Papal Legate,58 whom John, in his then state of disgrace and fear, was anxious to conciliate. For the remaining two years of John's life Hugh de Mortimer was one of his few steadfast adherents. On Feb. 16, 1215, the King allows him to take four hinds (bissas) in Morf Forest, two for his own use and two for the use of his Mother.59 On April 30 in the same year Hugh de Mortimer being with other Barons at Glou- cester, has a military summons to meet the King at Cirencester on May 4 following, and there expect his commands.60 On May 17th the King presents Mortimer and his associate Barons with a Destrier each, of those which the Sheriff of Gloucestershire had in keeping. The same day the King concedes to Mortimer the Gloucestershire Manors of Tefbury and Hampnett, which had been the marriage portion of his wife.61 On August 19 the King ap- points him to the custody of Strattondale (Church Stretton) Castle.63 His alleged interest in Stottesden under a Royal Grant has been already spoken of.63 On May 26, 1216, he was appointed a Commissioner to make peace on the King's behalf with Reginald de Braose64 (his brother-in-law). On June 3, 1216, the King gives him seizin of certain fees which Saer Earl of Winchester (one of the twenty-five Magna-Charta Barons) held under Mortimer.65 On August 8, 1216, he and three others are appointed Keepers of Elmley Castle and all other tenements and lands of Walter de Beauchamp, till the said Walter should have been to the Papal 57 Rot.

The latest Charter of King John which appears on the Rolls, bears date at Lincoln on September 28, 1216.67 The attestation of Roger de Mortimer proves his fidelity to the King in the last extreme. Three weeks later, and the earthly career of John Plantagenet had closed. On January 27, 1217, the young King, Henry III, gives to Hugh de Mortimer, by Patent, the lands of all the King's enemies, which were of Mortimer's Fee ; that is, the King empowered him to con fiscate all the estates of his anti-royalist Tenants. In October, 1217, the first Scutage of King Henry III was about to be collected. The Sheriffs of nine Counties were ordered to assist Isabel de Mortimer, and the Sheriffs of seventeen Counties were ordered to assist Hugh de Mortimer in enforcing payment on their respective Tenants.68 The Sheriff of Shropshire had an order in each case, and probably by mistake ; for the point to be no ticed is, that the said Sheriff, in his subsequent account of the money actually collected, makes no mention of Mortimer's Barony either as assessed or exempted.69 During the troubled period which closed the reign of John and ushered in that of his infant son Henrv, Lewellyn Prince of Wales had been consolidating his power. Among other acquisitions was Mortimer's territory of Melenvth. This Lewellyn surrendered to King Henry in May, 1220, the date when he met the King in amicable conference at Shrewsbury. On the 19th King Henry, again at Westminster, orders Henry de Audley to give possession of Melenyth to Hugh de Mortimer.70 In February, 1221, Hugh de Mortimer served in person at the siege of Biham, and had the usual Letters empower ing him to collect his own Scutage.71 On May 31, 1223, the King gives him 20 merks towards strengthening Wigmore Castle.73 In August of the same year, the Scutage of Montgomery being in process of collection, eighteen Sheriffs (the Sheriff of Shropshire included) had orders to allow Hugh de Mortimer to collect his own Scutage.73 As usual, the Sheriff of Shropshire neither enters any assessment or exemption of Mortimer's Barony.74 In July, 1225, 70.71.72.73 Claus.

I find Hugh de Mortimer suing Peter fitz Herbert and Isabella his wife (she was Mortimer's Mother) for lands in Langebergh.75 On March 23, 1226, the King grants to Hugh de Mortimer, till the King should come of age, the privilege of holding an annual Fair at his Manor of Cleybiry, the said Fair to last for three days, viz. Sept. 13, 14, and 15.70 Another Writ of July 5 changes these days to the 28th, 29th, and 30th of August,77 and a third Writ, dated August 24, 1227, substitutes the first-named days, but grants the Fair in perpetuity.78 Hugh de Mortimer died on the 10th of November, 1227, leaving no surviving issue. Consequently Ralph, his next Brother, was his Heir. But before I proceed with any account of the latter, I should notice a prominent feature in the history of these powerful and haughty Barons, viz. the extreme indifference with which they contracted debts with the Crown, the carelessness with which they treated them when contracted, and the apparent inability or unwillingness of tbe King to enforce pay ment. At his death Hugh de Mortimer owed the King no less a sum than \u20ac1015. 2s. 4d., besides a Destrier and two Hawks. Of this \u20ac511. 2s. 4d. had been an arrear of his Father's Fine for the ward ship of Walter de Beauchamp, contracted at least fourteen years before. The balance was composed of debts contracted by Hugh himself, the principal one being his Fine of 500 merks for Livery, and on this debt, of thirteen years standing, he had never paid a single farthing. The wife of Hugh de Mortimer was Annora, daughter of Wil liam and sister of Reginald de Braose. Her Father gave with her in marriage 100 solidates of land in Cherleton and Chiriton. She had no issue by Mortimer, and survived him some years. On September 28, 1232, Henry III confirms to her, as long as she shall live in seclusion (in reclusagio) , her Father's grant, but directs an ultimate reversion thereof to the right heirs.79 Ralph de Mortimer, on his succession, was accountable for all his father's debts. His own Livery, and Seizin of Wigmore Castle, granted by the King on November 23, 1227,80 cost him, or rather increased his nominal liabilities by, \u20ac100. more.81 But on July 8th, 1229, the King, for his faithful service, pardoned more than half 75.76.77-7S Claus, pp. 78, 103b, 126b, (Monasticon, VI, 350). 80 Patent, 12 Hen.

It was now to stand at \u20ac500, and to be paid off at the rate of \u20ac20. per annum.82 What service Ralph de Mortimer as a younger Son may have rendered to the Crown, I am unable to ascertain. Once, viz. in February, 1216, he seems to have been diplomatically employed by King John,83 but I find no other mention of his name till after his succession to the Barony. It must have been after his said succession that Ralph de Mortimer contracted a marriage which greatly augmented the subsequent pretensions of his House. Gladuse Duy, the daughter of Lewellyn the Great, by Joan, illegitimate daughter of King John, was the second but childless wife of Reginald de Braose, who died shortly before June 9, 1228.84 This Princess re-married to Ralph de Mor timer obviously in or after 1228, and, as the Wigmore Annalist tells us, Lewellyn gave with her the lands of Kery and Kedewyn. On failure, at a subsequent period, of all other legitimate descen dants of Lewellyn the Great, the Principality of North Wales was, not without reason, said to be in the representatives of Gladuse Duy. Here then was proper fuel for the future ambition of the House of Mortimer. Of Ralph de Mortimer's debt of \u20ac500. to the Crown, I have not ascertained further than that it remained undiminished in 1231.85 It was further increased by Pr\u00e6stita and Fines, which he seems to have treated with similar indifference. I now pass to the Aid collected in 1235-6 for the marriage of the King's Sister. Ralph de Mortimer's Shropshire Barony was incest of the most improbable character. We are accordingly surprised that the Chroniclers do not notice this feature of the ease. However, on fuller examination, we find that Gladuse was not Mother of William de Braose, but his step-mother. The alleged crime therefore, though not actual incest, was of so revolting a cha racter that it would account for the sum mary vengeance taken by Lewellyn. How ever, when one of the Chroniclers (Mat thew Paris) teEs us that Joan was ex ecuted also, and another that she survived till 1237, and was buried with circum stances of honourable consideration, we may still be allowed to doubt a story which accuses the Princess of adultery with her daughter's Stepson. 82 Rot.

The story that Lewellyn hung William de Braose for adultery with Joan, Lewellyn's wife, is told by more than one of the Chroniclers under the year 1230.

It is moreover quite clear that Mortimer paid the first half of this assessment. He paid apparently the sum of 13 merks 11s. \\\\d., which was, to a penny, at the current rate of 1 merk on each of 13| fees. Litfot, Seneschal of Cleobury, was the person who paid the money to the Collectors.86 The other in- stalment of one merk per fee is charged in two items, amounting to 13 merks 12s. 10c?., which is rather above the proper rate. This does not seem to have been paid at the time; and \u20ac2. Os. 6\\d. is entered as an arrear thereof still due in 1248,87 the year after Ralph de Mortimer's death. Meanwhile, that is about the year 1240, we have three distinct lists of the Shropshire Barony of Ralph de Mortimer, viz. of the Knights'-fees which composed it.88 Two of these Lists agree with each other except in some scribal particulars, and estimate the Barony of Ralph de Mortimer as con- taining 10| Knights'-fees. The third List enumerates not only the same 10^ Fees, but adds thereto 7\\ and \u00a7 fees, some of them in Herefordshire, but more in Shropshire. The total which should, according to the items, amount to ~i8\\ and \\ fees, is increased in the Record by half a fee more. The details of these Lists belong properly to the specific Manors enumerated. Here I need only observe that Cleobury is given at the head of each list as held by Ralph de Mortimer himself by one Knight's-Fee. In this year (1240) the Justices-in-Eyre being at Shrewsbury, Ralph de Mor timer compounded for some trespass by a Fine of 20 merks, half of which was paid at once.89 Ralph de Mortimer died August 6, 1246, leaving by his wife Gladuse, who survived him, a son and heir Roger, with other issue. On December 11, 1246, the King directs that the Executors of the Will of Ralph de Mortimer shall pay his debts to the Crown at four different terms, the first of which was to be Easter, 1247. The said debts amounted to 425 merks,90 showing that Mortimer in his lifetime had done little to diminish his liabilities.

That he was however for six months a ward of the Crown appears indirectly in this way. \u2014 The King's Officers had sown and tilled his lands, and when his Livery was allowed, it was stipulated that he should repay the cost of these operations. His Fine for Livery, 2000 merks, may further be taken to be not a mere Fine on succession, but a purchase of the King's remaining right of wardship. The Dower of Gladuse, his Mother, was reserved to her by a special provision in the King's Writ.91 One portion of those Wigmore Annals, which I have so often quoted, was written during the life of this Roger de Mortimer, probably about the year 1265. The Writer, be it observed, becomes more accurate as he speaks from his own recollections, for he not only mentions the minority of Roger de Mortimer and the King's temporary custody of his lands, but he intimates that fifteen years intervened between the date of Roger's Livery and the evident ap proaches of civil war.93 The calculation will be found true to a nicety. Returning to earlier events we find that about the time when he came into possession of his estates, but more certainly before the end of the year 1247,93 Roger de Mortimer took to wife Matilda, the eldest daughter and Coheir of that William de Braose, whom Lewellyn had put to death in 1230. This Lady brought with her not only a third of the Honour of Braose of Brecknock, but also her proportionate share in the Honour of the Earls Marshall, of the last of whom her Mother Eva was a Sister and Coheir.94 Mor timer thus acquired the Lordship of Radnor, as well as large estates in Carmarthenshire, and elsewhere in England, Wales, and Ireland. At this point the History of the House of Mortimer passes from the scope of a merely provincial Record, and becomes a feature in the Annals of a nation. My business therefore is to add to greater accounts such local illustrations as will best befit my limits. In the year 1255, the Inquest of Tenures in Stottesden Hundred describes the status of Cleobury Mortimer with little indication of those peculiar privileges which were afterwards obtained or claimed for the lands of Mortimer. \u2014 \" Roger de Mortimer was Lord of the Vill, and held it in capite of the King.

Cleobury should in short have been reckoned, in 1255, to contain at least 6\\ hides, and paid higher sums for Stretward, etc. ; but it is no presumption to say that the fiscal officers of the thirteenth Century had less comparative knowledge of Domesday than may be acquired in the nineteenth by any diligent Antiquary. In May and July, 1256, I find the King ordering an Inquest to be taken concerning a right of common pasture in Hundesnene, which seems to have been in dispute between the Queen's Bailiffs on the one part, aud Roger de Mortimer and his men of Cleobury on the other.97 On January 18, 1257, Roger de Mortimer has letters of protection while employed in the King's service in Wales.98 On April 30, 1258, the King promises large pecuniary aid to enable Mortimer to maintain his Welsh warfare.98 On Feb. 27, 1259, the Coheiresses of William de Braose having come to an agreement as to their shares in his inheritance, Giles de Erdinton has orders to assign to Matilda, wife of Roger de Mortimer, her esnecy, or elder sister's share, viz. 100 solidates of such lands as lay nearest to the previous possessions of Roger and Matilda.98 On June 11, of the same year, Mortimer is appointed one of the Commissioners to de mand satisfaction from Lewellyn ap Griflyth, for breaches of truce, with power to prolong the truce and to treat of peace.98 On June 25, the Commissioners concluded on a year's truce, at Montgomery.99 A Patent of May 8, 1260, enables Mortimer to levy Customs for seven years ensuing towards the fortifications of Knighton Castle -1 another, of May 18, appoints John de Lingen, a commissioner, to obtain satisfaction from Lewellyn for injuries done to Prince Ed ward, to Roger de Mortimer, and to the Earl of Gloucester.1 An entry on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1260 shows that the King 93 Rot.

Mor timer was now charged in turn for his wife's proportion of this, as advanced by the King. His debt being at the rate of 26 merks, 8s. \\0\\d.per annum, had now accumulated to 346 merks, 8s. \\Q\\d. on this item of account. On July 17, 1260, Mortimer arrived in London to attend a Great Council to which he had been summoned. That day the Welsh took Builth Castle, of which Mortimer had the custody on behalf of Prince Edward. The news reached London on the 20th. The King and Prince issued a Writ acquitting Mor timer of all blame ; but afterwards Prince Edward seems to have retracted that admission.3 In August following Mortimer was again named on a commission to treat with Lewellyn,3 but a Truce con cluded on the 22nd has not his name attached. In June, 1262, Lewellyn had complained to the King of breaches of Truce com mitted by Roger de Mortimer and John le Strange, and the King appointed Commissioners to discuss and arbitrate the matter.4 In December of that year, Lewellyn besieged and took Mortimer's Castle of Knoklas, and another Castle, Kenenchles, was surrendered. The Marches were in a fearfully disturbed state. The Wigmore Annalist attributes the loss of Mortimer's Castles to the treachery of his men ; but the cotemporary Bishop of Hereford writing to tell the King, just returned to England, of the state of the Marches, describes Mortimer as himself surrendering Kenenchles, and march ing out with all his people, unresisting and uninjured. The Bishop did not mean to impugn the fidelity of the King's Lieges, but he represents that the local panic was increased by a general impres sion that the whole disaster was the result of fraud and evil machi nations.5 The subsequent career of Mortimer belies any suspicion or insinuation which ever questioned his loyalty. On the 18th of February, 1263, he, with Brian de Brompton, John de Lingen, Matthew de Gamages, Ralph de Araz, and Robert Corbet, have the King's Letters of Protection till June 24 following, aud whilst the war should last with Wales.6 On November 13, the King promises to provide for Edmund, Son of Roger de Mortimer, Clerk, some competent Benefice, as soon as opportunity shall offer.6 Hence we learn that the eventual heir of Wigmore was originally destined to 2 F\u0153dera, I, 398. 4 * 5 F\u0153dera, I, 420, 423. 6 Rot.

On Nov. 23, the former Letters of Protection are re newed for Roger de Mortimer and his Knights.6 On Dec. 18, the King grants to Mortimer and his heirs an annuity of \u20ac100, till such time as he should give them 100 Librates of land.6 In De cember, 1263, Mortimer and Prince Edward were on the King's side as against the Barons, when both parties agreed to defer to the arbitration of St. Louis, King of Franc'e.7 On Dec. 24, 1263, Jan. 20, and Feb. 7, 1264, Mortimer is put on different commissions to treat of peace with Lewellyn, and as Keeper of the Peace in Shrop shire.8 On April 6th, when the King won a signal success at North ampton, Mortimer was one of the leaders of his army, according to Matthew Paris's Continuator ; whilst another Chronicle assigns to Mortimer the chief credit in the affair.9 From the less fortunate field of Lewes, on May 14 following, Mortimer seems to have been absent. The King's captivity, instead of awing the Barons of the West, seems to have associated them in an indissoluble league against Montfort. Roger de Mortimer, Roger de Clifford, James de Audley, Roger de Leyburn, and Hugh de Turberrile, are the chief names in this noble alliance. Montfort soon attacked them, but the result is the subject of several very discordant accounts. One Writer describes Montfort as ravaging Mortimer's lands, and then concluding a peace at Montgomery with the Lords Marchers, who gave hostages to Montfort. Another represents Mortimer and his associates as throwing down their arms, surrendering their Castles, and being condemned by sentence of their Peers to various terms of expatriation iu Ireland. Another says, that they lingered on the Sea-coast, or among the Welsh mountains, awaiting the turn of events ; a fourth, that they took refuge in the Welsh Castles of Prince Edward, and lived by plundering the natives. The Patent- Rolls exhibit another phase of the story. On June 4, 1264, one of the forged Patents of the period invites Roger de Mortimer to at tend a Council at London, and bring with him the Prisoners he had taken at Northampton, five of whom are named. Between this time and the 24th of April, 1265, I find Roger de Mortimer's name figuring in at least sixteen Pseudo- Patents, which variously exhort or command him to come to the King under safe-conduct, and render and receive what is just ; \u2014 to come to the King with his Pri- 6 Rot.

What Mortimer was actually doing or suffering during this period, neither Patent nor Chronicle has specifically declared. What he was planning be came sufficiently apparent on the evening of the 30th of May, when by his chivalrous contrivance, Prince Edward bade adieu to his Gaolers on the Plain of Widmarsh, and supped with Mortimer in Wigmore Castle. I pass over the stirring but well-known incidents of the next two months till, on the 4th of August, three Leaders expected the march of Montfort on the field of Evesham. They were to all appearance, and as regarded age and experience, no match for the craftiest poli tician, and perhaps the ablest General of the day. Edward Plan tagenet had lately completed his thirty- sixth year, Roger de Mor timer was probably a year younger, Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Glou cester, was not yet twenty-seven. Compare these three Confederates in other respects, and the contrast will be not unfavourable to Mor timer. Edward, though the heir of his Father's throne, had at one time been a partisan of the Barons, and so an instrument of bis Father's difficulties. Since then Edward had fought at Lewes, but by his indiscretion had lost the day. Had it not been for the knight-errantry of Mortimer, Edward had still been the Prisoner of Montfort. As to De Clare, he too had fought at Lewes, but against the Crown, and his recent conversion to Loyalty had much in it of a selfish man\u0153uvre. The man who stood on the field of Evesham conspicuous for valour, conduct, and patient consistency, was Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. After the victory of that day, no privilege, reward, or honour was too great for Mortimer to ask, or the King to grant. It would be vain to attempt an enume ration of particulars, and a local matter shall have our first atten tion. I have before given the substance of a Charter which Mor timer obtained at Kenilworth on November 9, 1266.10 This Charter ostensibly made Cleobury and Chelmarsh a single Manor, which, with its members, was henceforth to be independent of all suits to County or Hundred, was in fact to be a Hundred in itself. On the strength of this, Mortimer professed to consider not less than twenty Manors to be members of Cleobury and Chelmarsh, and consoli dating them all into one Franchise, he set up his central Court at 10 Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 40, 206, 207."], [686, "222 CLEOBURY MORTIMER. Cleobury. By this process the King's Hundred of Stottesden lost the suit not only of Cleobury and Chelmarsh, but of Kinlet, Higley, Catsley, Neen Savage, The Low, Eudon George, Sidbury, Neenton, Overton, Burwarton, Mawley, Stepple, and part of Charlcott; Corley, Hints, and Hope Baggot were taken from the Hundred of Overs ; Ashford Jones, Huntington, and Sheet, from the Hundred of Munslow and Shipley and Rudge, from the King's Liberty of Claverley.11 Other advantages taken by Mortimer under his Kenil worth Charter shall be spoken of hereafter. On February 11, 1270, Mortimer was of the King's Council at Westminster, when a cu rious plan was discussed and adopted for improving the Sheriffs' annual accounts, commonly known as the Pipe-Rolls?2 On Au gust 2, Prince Edward, about to leave England for Palestine, names Mortimer as one of the Trustees who were to have charge of his estates.13 It was during the absence of Prince Edward, and after King Henry's death, that Ralph, son and heir-apparent of Roger de Mortimer, was appointed to the Shrievalty of Shropshire and Staffordshire. This office he held from January 23, 1273, till Michaelmas of the same year, when Robert de Trillek, his Under- Sheriff, accounted on his behalf at the Exchequer.14 At Michaelmas, 1274, no Sheriff appeared for these Counties ; but at Michaelmas, 1275, Ralph de Mortimer was deceased, and another Sheriff (Bogo de Knovill) accounted for the year then ended ; also Robert de Trillek accounted for the year omitted, on behalf of Ralph de Mortimer deceased.15 The Wigmore Annalist mentions Ralph de Mortimer as a Knight, and as dying in his Father's lifetime. He can hardly have been more than twenty-six years of age, but the mode of his death has still to be ascertained. In November, 1274, the Jurors of Stottesden and other Hundreds made various presentments as to the mode in which Roger de Mortimer had been, since the siege of Kenilworth, attracting the suits of the various Manors before enumerated to his Court of Cleobury. Moreover it was shown how his Bailiffs held a great Tourn before the Sheriff held his Tourn; how also they decided Pleas of land with or without a King's Writ, as it happened. They distrained Tenants of an acre of land without a house to attend their great Tourn, like other free Tenants. Moreover Sir Roger de Mortimer claimed to have extract and return of all Writs, 11 Rot. Hundred, II, 90, 100,103, 108. I '\u25a0'- ' '3 F\u0153dera, I, pp. 483, 484. 14 \u25a015 Rot.

He had a Gallows there and other Royal Franchises, and he held pleas as to the assize of bread and beer.16 There is an undated and nearly illegible Inquisition, which about this time reported on these and other disturbances of the Shropshire Hundreds. It estimates the yearly damage to the Crown which resulted from each with drawal of Suit. I make out that 6s. 8d. was the value of the two appearances, which Cleobury Mortimer had ceased to make at the Sheriff's Tourn in Stottesden Hundred.17 Roger de Mortimer, in 1277, when the King's army was to mus ter at Worcester against Lewellyn on July 1, made a statement of the Knights' service due from his Western Barony. His return is very illustrative of a question already discussed. He acknowledged himself to owe the service of six Knights, viz. 3 for Wigmore, 2 for Elveyn, and 1 for the heritage of William de Braose ;18 nothing, be it observed, for his Honour of Cleobury. Passing over events of greater or less notoriety, I come to the death of Roger de Mortimer, which seems to have taken place at Kingsland (Herefordshire), on October 27, 1282. No Inquisition after his decease seems to have been taken as to his Shropshire es tates. His wife Matilda survived him nineteen years. Edmund, as the Survivor of Ralph his elder brother, was Roger's next heir.19 He was now 27 years of age or thereabouts, and doing his homage had Livery of his lands on Nov. 24, 1282. 30 According to the Wig more Annalist he was taken to Court, knighted by King Edward, and afterwards espoused to a kinswoman of the Queen, \u2014 a Spanish Lady named Margaret de Fendles, if we accept the orthography of the same Writer. It may be a question as to what order of time these events occurred in. At the time of his Father's death Edmund de Mortimer was not only already knighted, but an active participator in King Edward's invasion of Wales. In the same year the King had entrusted him with the custody of the Castles of Oswestry and Arundel. When, on December 11, 1282, Lewellyn fell at Builth, Edmund de Mortimer was in command of the detachment by whose instrumentality that tragedy was consummated. His eldest son Roger was born either on April 25 or May 3, 1286 or 1287 (for the Inquisitions which state his age vary), and so his Father's marriage but I think it later. 16 Rot. Hundred.

Edmund de Mortimer's numerous summonses and public em ployments I must leave to other Records.21 I have before shown how in 1292 he was sued under Writs of Quo Waranto for the various Franchises arrogated by his Father.23 Besides Shipley and Rudge already mentioned, he claimed to have ways and to hold pleas of the Crown in Coreley, Hints, Hope Baggot, Ashford (Jones), Hun tinton, Sheet, and Shineton, alleging them to be members of Cleo bury. As to Overton and more than twenty Manors in the South west of Shropshire, they were named in the Writ of Quo Waranto, but no pleadings followed in regard to them. The King's Attorney denied Shipley and Rudge to be members of Cleobury, and the re sult of that issue I have afready given. As to the Manors in general, the same Attorney pleaded that the privileges claimed were essen tially a part of the Crown, by which the King was a King,33 and without a specific grant of the King, they could not be separated from the Crown. The question as a whole was adjourned thrice ; the third time to be heard before the King himself, whenever he should be in England.34 Another Writ of Quo Waranto prosecuted Edmund de Morti mer for withdrawing the Suits of most of the Manors before enu merated,25 from the Hundreds of Stottesden, Munslow, and Overs. Mortimer appealed as before to King Henry's Charter in respect of Cleobury and Chelmarsh, alleging all the other places to be members of Cleobury. Hugh de Louther answered that the King's Charter only purported to extend to what Mortimer's Father held in demesne, and instanced several Manors, neither so held by Roger at the time, nor by Edmund now. The cause was adjourned, and I lose the issue.26 There is some doubt about the exact time and place of Edmund de Mortimer's death. Dugdale altogether misunderstood the Wig more Annalist in saying, that it was in consequence of \"mortal wounds received in battle at Buelt.\" It was Lewellyn's death that the Annalist thus alluded to. What the said Annalist says of 21 See Parliamentary Writs, Vol. I, pp, 748, 749. 25 Supra, p. 222. Overton, Mawley, Step pie, and Charlcott are omitted from the enumeration.

The day named is certainly erroneous, perhaps also the place. The King's writ of Diem clausit extremum, on the death of Edmund de Mortimer, bears date at Stirling, on July 25, 1304. Either then Mortimer died in Scotland (and he certainly had sum mons to attend the King's northern expedition in person) or else he died some days before July 25, in England. The Inquests after his death were various. The one which sat at Cleobury Mortimer, on August 21, made that statement about his Tenure by Seneschalcy, which I have so fully weighed already. The age of his son and heir was 16^ years according to the Wigmore Annalist, \\8\\ according to one Inquest, and \\7\\ according to three. The two most authoritative Inquests further agree in naming April 25 as his birthday, in opposition to May 3.27 Roger de Mortimer, who now succeeded as Baron of Wig more, seems to have inherited and combined the worst qualities of the three races whose blood mingled in his veins, \u2014 the Norman, the Castilian, and the Cambro-Briton. His career, having been a mix ture of violence and ambition, of pride and folly, of intrigue and treachery, ended on a scaffold. His great power on the Borders had suggested his elevation to a new title, \u2014 the Earldom of March, a dignity which, being forfeited by his Attainder, was not restored to his Son, but reappeared in four subsequent generations of his male line. His descendants and lineal representatives in the seventh generation were two sceptred Kings.28 Of the many great names which are now merged in the Royalty of England, that of Morti mer, if it be far less than the brightest jewel of the Crown, must always be associated with great reminiscences, must ever point to the wisest morals which the Rulers of mankind can contemplate. Of the Under-Tenants in a Manor of Mortimer's demesne we can expect to hear but little. Mt>st of them were probably Copy holders, and their affairs usually settled by the local Court. Two Fines in 1240 and 1256 are legal memoranda which I find in excep tion to the general rule, and they, speaking indistinctively of small tenements in Cleyburi, may very possibly belong to Cleobury North.

Thereby Robert de le Holte and Alice his wife quit-claim to Ed mund de Mortimer their right to a messuage, a virgate, and 3 acres of Bosc in Clebury, for which Mortimer gives 100s. In November, 1305, Roger, son of John Aunger, Plaintiff in a Fine, conveys to Walter, son of Elyas de Tyllshope, and to Juliana, Walter's wife, a messuage and 10 acres in Cleobury Mortimer, which premises they in turn settle on Roger and his heirs, with remainder to Agnes, Roger's sister, and her heirs of her body, with further remainder to the right heirs of Roger.

The Priest spoken of as resident here at the time of the Domesday Survey implies, I think, a pre-existent Church, perhaps the founda tion of Queen Edith herself. In 1179, when Hugh de Mortimer effectually founded his Abbey of Wigmore, he is stated to have given among its endowments the Church of Cleobury.33 Before the close of the twelfth century we have another positive mention of the Church of Cleobury. A son of Sir Roger de Mortimer and of the Lady Isabel de Ferrers, which hardly survived its birth, is stated to have been buried here. The Canons of Wigmore were careful to record the circumstance, because the sorrows of the Mother, blended le Venur, and Hawise his wife, Tenants, of half a virgate in Cleyburi.

The other allusions of Domesday I have before explained, viz. how William fitz Osborn, Earl of Hereford, was the first Lord of Cleobury and Mawley after the Conquest, how he enfeoffed Tur stin de Wigmore therein, and how the latter was removed when the King bestowed the Seigneury of the whole estate on Ralph de Mor timer. As to Lei and Fech, no vills or hamlets adjacent to Cleobury can now be found to correspond with such names ; but I think it very probable that the two virgates thus called are now involved in the East Foreign, or the West Foreign, Liberties of Cleobury. It is further possible that the name Fech was entered in Domesday improperly as that of a place. A Saxon named Fech had held a virgate in Barbingi (Baveney) in Saxon times, and still retained it at Domesday,2 and this virgate had apparently been sometime associ ated with Cleobury. I am not suggesting that this virgate was identical with the one called Fech in Domesday, only that the latter was inaccurately used as the name of a place or district, being really the name of a person. Under such circumstances it is no wonder that Fech, as a locabty, cannot now be identified. Melela, the remaining Manor, is unquestionably Mawley, and of that I proceed to speak. It was not, like Cleobury, held by the Mortimers in demesne ; \u2014 but the name of their Feoffee very seldom occurs. In or about 1240 the said Feoffee was John de Melleleg, holding it of the Barons Mortimer, by service of one-fourth part of a knight's-fee. The Hundred-Roll of 1255, treating, as I have shown, the Manor of Cleobury in a comprehensive way, makes no distinct mention of its various members, and consequently does not tell us who then held Mawley. I find, however, one John de Mal leye as a Juror for the Liberty of Cleobury at the Assizes of 1272, and also as attesting a quit- claim to Sir Roger de Mortimer about 1275. Further, the Inquest on the death of Edmund de Mortimer, in 1304, mentions his Tenant of one-fourth of a fee in Mauleye, the name of the said Tenant being apparently John.3 In subsequent Feodaries the Knight's service due on Mawley is variously stated as 1 fee, | fee, and i fee. 1 * - Domesday, fos. 260, a, 1, and 257, a, 1. | 3 Inquisitions, 32 Edw.

It is further probable that the names of very many streams and rivers meant simply Stream or River in the language to which they originally belonged.1 Thus the original meaning of the word Neen is said to be a Stream,3 and ac cordingly we find two places in Shropshire so named to be situated upon streams. Besides this we hear that the River Rea was occa sionally called The Neen ; \u2014 and it is no wonder that the names were interchanged, for Rea itself means simply River. Nene at the time of Domesday was the name of two Manors or else of a divided Manor; being held by two several Feoffees of Ralph de Mortemer, who held the whole of the King. \u2014 Of the first of these, the Record says \u2014 \" The same Ralph (de Mortemer) holds Nene, and Richard (holds it) of him.

We have also the Greek (,!_ (to flow), and the British Rhiw (a river), all probably derived from the same primeval root. 2 Nan, a brook, is one of the asserted remains of a primitive language. Its de rivatives, or cognates, are certainly found very widely. We have Nen or Nine, still the name of a River in Northamptonshire.

Such an assumption would be too great, for the Bromptons did not succeed to all Rich ard's Domesday Tenures ; and the first known ancestor, in the male line, of the Bromptons was cotemporary with, but certainly dis tinct from, Richard. I conclude that Richard's Domesday estates lapsed to an Heiress or to Coheiresses, who, or one of whom, mar ried an Ancestor of the Bromptons, and so carried to him a great part of those estates. As to the residue of the said estates, I do not find them subsequently in any particular succession. I think that some time they reverted to Mortimer as Suzerain, and were retained in his demesne or regranted in small parcels at his pleasure. As to Richard's Manor of Nene, we cannot trace its existence, as a whole, at any period subsequent to Domesday. Either, then, it came to be absorbed piecemeal in some greater Manor, or being first disinte grated it was apportioned in parcels to different Manors. In either case we must not expect to trace this lost Manor by finding what other Manors in this Hundred increased upon their Domesday hidage. Kinlet so increased, but not in the degree required by any supposed addition of a Manor of 2^ hides, nor in any degree which may not be accounted for in other ways. Cleobury Mortimer so increased ; but then its increase of one hide, though perhaps understated, is more than accounted for by the annexation of other Manors than Richard's Nene.4 All means of proof failing, I am content in this matter to offer an opinion. \u2014 Mr. Blakeway considered Richard's Manor of Nene to be represented by Cleobury Lodge, now a place in the West Foreign Division of Cleobury Mortimer. I can think of no more probable conjecture, and it is tantamount to the idea already expressed, viz. that Richard's Neen sometime reverted to Mortimer, as Seigneur, and was annexed to his Capital Manor of Cleobury. I further think that it was a part of Richard's Neen, which being granted to Wigmore Abbey, is included, in the Taxation of 1291, among the Temporalities of that House. The Abbot had assized rents, also a Mill and 8 acres of land in Nene, which yielded alto- with modern acreage strongly supports such an opinion. \u2014 The 7671 acres, which now compose the Manor of Cleobury Mor timer, should at the very lowest calculation include at least 9 Domesday Hides, and we cannot get that number without throw ing Richard's Nene into the combination. 4 Viz. Wall-Town, Mawley, Lei, Fech, and Earls Ditton. However, I consider the hidage returned, in 1255, as delusive ; and as it failed to give account of ascer tained additions to Cleobury, so it very possibly concealed other additions which we cannot now detect. A comparison"], [698, "232 richard's neen. gether \u20ac1. 16s. 4d? Now as the Abbot had no such temporal estate in Neen Savage or Neen Sollars, we are obliged to conclude that Richard's Neen was the locality here spoken of. Lastly, I suppose that this Abbatial estate in Richard's Neen was the identical estate which was afterwards said to be in Neen-Monell. This distinctive name, Neen-Monell, though I first find it in actual use in the sixteenth century, was, I think, a revival ; that is, I sup pose Richard's Neen to have been first called Neen-Monell from some Tenant thereof, after Domesday, but before it reverted to Mor timer. The particulars of a temporal estate, and of tithes, which, in 1534, were enjoyed by the Abbot of Wigmore in Cleobury Morti mer, Neen-Monell, and Morehall, have already been given under Cleobury Mortimer.6 0tm l^abaflt* JUtintiesnenc, Mortimer's other Manor of Nene is described in Domesday as follows :\u25a0 \u2014 \" The same Ralph (de Mortemer) holds Nene (of the King), and Ingelrann (holds it) of him.

To them therefore we may, with good reason, assign a descent from Ingelrann. That Manor of Nene which was Ingefrann's at Domesday, came to them and was thenceforth known as Neen Savage, to distinguish it not only from Richard's Neen, but from Neen Sollers, a third Manor in the same Hundred, but of a totally different status. I have spoken, under Eudon-George, of William le Savage (living 5 Pope Nich.

On May 2, 1199, Adam Sauvage, of Shrop shire, essoigns himself by Richard fitz Henry in a plea of land which he had against Eudo Martell,4 which Eudo Martell appears about the same time to be litigating the Advowson of Steeple Winterburn (Dorsetshire) against Roger de Mortimer.5 In October, 1199, Adam Salvage was Recognizor in a Suit which I have noticed under Clee St. Margaret,6 and in October, 1203, he stands Surety for Roger de Mortimer in a Suit which concerned Brace-Meole. At the same time he was a Knight and a Juror in many causes then tried at the County Assizes. His suit with John de Brompton, in 1210, I shall give under Kinlet. Adam le Savage (II) was deceased, as I have stated under Eudon George, in 1221, when his six Sisters, or their heirs, were his representatives. At the Assizes of November, 1221, Christiana le Sauvage, Margery, wife of Walter de Verdun, and Roheis de Pedewurdin sued Hugh de Mortimer for 3 carucates of land in Niene and in Siete (Sheet), which they claimed as heirs of their brother Adam, whom they asserted to have died seized thereof in demesne. Mortimer pleaded that the three Plaintiffs had had three other Sisters, which Sisters had left issue, yet surviving. The Plaintiffs admitted the fact, and the admission was fatal, obviously because the parties necessary to such a Suit were not all taking part in it.7 In 1240, of the Coheirs of Le Savage, William de St. George alone is named as having an interest in Neen ; but it is clear that Geoffrey de Overton's Fee was partly in Neen Savage.8 This will appear from the Hundred- Roll of 1255, which says that \u2014 \" William de St. George is Lord of Nene Savage, together with Geoffrey de Overton. Therein are two and a half hides of land, of which William de St. George holds three parts, and Geoffrey de Overton, together with Nicholas his son, the fourth part.

At the Assizes of January, 1256, Wil liam de St. George being sued for disseizing Ralph de la Lawe of common-pasture in 30 acres of heath at Nene, pleaded that the Plaintiff was never fully seized thereof, and so got a verdict.10 By a Patent of May 8, 1256, it would appear that William de St. George had sometime previously conceded (on mortgage, I suppose) this Manor to the Queen of Henry III. The Patent directs Wil liam Trussell to inquire whether Roger de Mortimer and his men of Cleobury had violently entered certain demesne pasture in Hun desnene (now in the Queen's hand by concession of William de St. George), and had depastured their cattle there against the King's Peace ; or whether the said men, who were Free Burgesses, had a prescriptive right to the said common pasture, as having used it in the time of William de St. George and his Ancestors, as Roger de Mortimer affirmed the said Burgesses to have done ? u On July 27 of the same year, WiUiam Trussell is again commis sioned to investigate the quarrel between the Queen's Bailiffs on the one hand, and Roger de Mortimer and the men of Cleobury on the other, concerning pasture in Hunesnene ; and the Sheriff of Shrop shire is enjoined to summon Recognizors in the case, so many and of such sort, as that no defect in the Jury shall cause the Inquest to be further delayed. At the Assizes of 1272, Adam de St. George was the Juror who chose his eleven associates for the Liberty of Cleobury. The Inquisition on the death of Edmund de Mortimer, in 1304, gives John de St. George as Tenant of one knight's-fee in Eudon George and Neen Savage.12 Having already said much of the families of Overton and St. George under Eudon George, and having more to say under other localities, I insert here one or two minor matters specially relating to Neen Savage. At the Salop Assizes in Oct. 1203, Edith, Sibil, and Muriel fitz Samson had a suit pending concerning half a virgate in Nene.

THE CHURCH. This was one of the Churches which Hugh de Mortimer bestowed on Wigmore Abbey in 1179, so that it appears that the Advowson had not been granted with the Manor to Le Savage. The date of Appropriation is not discoverable, but in 1291 the Abbot of Wig more's Rectorial interest is valued at \u20ac6. 13s. 4d., whilst the Vicar's Portion was less than \u20ac4. The Church was in Stottesden Deanery.16 In 1341, the Church Taxation of Neinsavage being first quoted as \u20ac6. 13s. 4d., the Parish was assessed to the Ninth at \u20ac4. 10s. The reasons for the difference were a prevalent murrain among the sheep, and because the small tithes, a Mill, the Offerings, and Glebe, with other profits, went to compose the Taxation, and were not now to be reckoned. Moreover, there were no lambs nor wool in the Parish, and eight virgates of land lay uutilled.17 In 1534-5, the Valor gives John Haymond as Vicar of Nyende Savage, and values his preferment at \u20ac5. 17s. 6d., out of which he paid a pension of 13s. 4d. to the Abbot of Wigmore, and 7s. 8d. for Archdeacon's Procura tions, and Synodals.18 The Abbot of Wigmore's cotemporary re turn seems to acknowledge the Receipt of the said Pension,10 but the Great Tithes are not mentioned.

The Saxon word Hl\u00e6p (that which covers a grave) came secondarily to designate a hill, simply because ancient burial-grounds usually formed a hill. It is curious that exactly the converse has taken place in regard to the Latin word tumulus, which, meaning primarily any sbght elevation of the earth's surface, is secondarily, and in the present day, almost ex clusively applied to such elevations only as are supposed to contain sepulchral remains. The Low now before us was another of the Manors held imme diately of the Crown by Ralph de Mortemer.

He occurs also in 1228 and 1232. 5 In 1240, the same or another Ralph de la Lawe is said to hold a Knight's fee in La Lawe of Mortimer's Barony.6 Again in 1251, Ralph was the name of the possessor of this estate.7 The Inquest of Tenures in Stottesden Hundred, taken in 1255,8 shows that The Low main tained its Domesday measurement of i hide. \" Ralph de la Lowe was Lord thereof.

On Nov. 27, 1274, John de la Lowe was on the Jury which took the Inquisition of Stottesden Hundred.

Of Ralph de Mortemer's Domes day -Tenant, Richard, I have spoken under Neen- Monell,3 and intimated that Richard's successors were of more than one family, aud were probably related to him as coheirs. At Kin let we can show that his successors, the Bromptons, were descended from a male ancestor, cotemporary with, but quite distinct from, Richard. It is most rare that the genealogy of any family, of mere knightly rank, can be traced in the male bne, and on good evidence, so far back as Domesday. In Shropshire this is especially the case ; because ' Inquisitions, 20 Edw. II, No. 53 (so calendared erroneously). 1 Domesday, fo. 260 a. 2. 2 Supra, pp. 194, 229. 3 Supra, pp. 230, 231."], [707, "KlNLET. 241 there was a period, from 1086 to 1166, which is nearly a vacuum as regards the existence of any Records likely to bear upon such a re search. I am now about to introduce a genealogy which is unques tionably older than Domesday, and so a remarkable exception to the general rule. It is that of the Bromptons sometime of Kinlet and Brompton Brian, and it stands on accidental but yet perfect evi dence. In the time and probably in the Court of King William the Con queror there lived one\u2014 Bernard fitz Ospac He stands last witness to a Charter of that King in favour of the Norman Abbey of Fecamp, a Charter which probably passed in Normandy in 1074 or 1075, but which we may positively date between 1070 and 1078 wherever it passed.4 Again, there is a great Charter by which King William the Con queror records, accepts, and confirms the donations made by his Barons to his own Foundation, \u2014 the Abbey of St. Stephen at Caen. The witnesses to this Charter have their names appended thereto in a form which leaves it doubtful whether they were not also con tributors to the Foundation. The first witness is King William himself, the last but one is Bernard fitz Ospac, and if the other witnesses were cotemporarily present (a matter not always certain in these early documents), then the Deed was probably written in the Autumn of 1077. 5 Again, King William, being evidently in Normandy, confirms an eleemosynary grant of the first William de Braose which, it will be sufficient to state here, passed either in 1074, 1075, or 1080. It was a grant to the Church of St. Florence at Salmur. The King's Confirmation, necessarily later than the grant, is attested in the last place by Bernard fitz Uspach.6 Ber nard fitz Uspach, thus frequenting the Court of King Wilbam, does not, that I know of, appear anywhere in Domesday? The same re mark applies to Bernard de Newmarch who, though a witness of King William's Charters, and commissioned by that Monarch to the Conquest of Brecknockshire, does not seem to have been encou- 4 Monasticon, VII, 1082 b. (1080) most probable. The said confirma tion will therefore have been added be tween 1080 and 1083, for Queen Matilda, who follows her husband in confirming, died in 1083. 5 Monasticon, VII, 1071, Num. III. 6 Monasticon,\\ll, 669 a. An ingenious note in the Monasticon fixes the day of Braose's Deed as January 30, 1075. From the same premises, differently interpreted, I think it must have been January 30, 1074 or 1080, and the names attesting the King's confirmation make the last year \" There was one Radulf fitz Unspac holding a Kentish Manor of the Archbi shop of Canterbury (Domesday, so. 4, a), and he possibly was a Brother of Bernard. 3] IV."], [708, "242 KINLET. raged or rewarded by any grants of English territory. This com parison between Bernard fitz Uspach and Bernard de Newmarch is not so irrelevant as it may at first sight appear. They were not identical, that is certain, but I am much mistaken if they were not both concerned in the conquest of Brecknockshire. I have already quoted a Charter which passed in the beginning of the thirteenth century, but which speaks of land near to Brecon as having once belonged to Bernard Unspac.8 This local reminiscence of Bernard Unspac, perhaps eighty years after he had ceased to live, is quite consistent with the idea that he was one of Bernard de Newmarch's companions in conquest and one of his original Feoffees. What I have next to say about Bernard Unspac is much more positive. He was Lord of Kinlet in the time of Henry I, and he was Father of Brien Unspac, also of Kinlet. The following Precept of King Henry II belongs to the earlier part of his reign,9 probably to the year 1157 or 1158, in each of which he visited Worcester. \u2014 \" H Rex Angli\u00e6 et Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6 et Comes An degavi\u00e6 Vicecomiti et omnibus Ministris suis de Salopescire salu tem.

Here we have an early instance of the name of an Ancestor (Unspac) being adopted as the surname of a family without the interposition of the usual word filius or fitz. We have also a proof of what I have before asserted, viz. that the Domesday Hundreds of Shropshire were changed earlier than Henry II's reign, if not as early as Henry I's, otherwise the memory of persons in Stottesden Hundred would be appealed to inappropriately. We have 8 Supra, p. 185. Sheriff of Worcestershire from 1155 to 1170. (See Vol. II, p. 64, note 4 for fur ther remarks on a similar matter.) 9 The character of the document favours this idea.

I must now speak of\u2014 Brian de Brompton, known to have been living in 1176 and 1179. He was either identical with, or else the son of, Brian Un spac. The question is a chronological one only. It is possible that a son and heir may be living a century after the appearance of his Father in public life. Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore living in 1180 was an instance of this. Perhaps the three first generations of the Feoffees at Kinlet were parallel in point of duration to the same number of generations in the family of the Suzerain. If so, Brian Unspac and Brian de Brompton were identical, but such in stances are very rare.11 To continue. \u2014 In 1176 the King having held Pleas of the Forest in Worcestershire had amerced Brien de Bromton in the sum of 6 merks.13 Hugh de Mortimer's foundation of Wigmore Abbey is said to have been definitely resolved on in 1179. The French Annals, which I have often quoted, without dating the event give very full particulars. Brian de Brompton and his son John were most urgent about the undertaking. \" Hugh de Mortimer laid the first stone. Brian de Brompton laid the second, and promised 100s. in aid of the work : but he gave no money, though he granted the Canons all easements in his lands, which easements were of great avail. John, son of the said Brian, laid the third stone and neither gave nor promised anything, but what he did not then do in promise he performed fully afterwards in deed, for by him was the Church of Kynleth given to the Abbey.\"13 This Brian de Brompton had a Brother Roger, called Roger de Kinlet from the Tenant-interest which he had in this Manor. The two brothers joined in a grant to the Norman Abbey of Lira, giving thereto \" one man, together with his land in the Manor of Kinled,\" which grant purports to have been previously made by the Ances tors of Brian de Brompton. The said Brian also gave to Lira two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Kinled and Frenchcote (Foxcote I suppose) and Walton.14 The same two Brothers, Brian \" \u00bb Ina note I may state my own tho rough conviction that Brian Unspac and Brian de Brompton were Father and Son. Roger de Kinlet, brother of the latter, was alive in 1193, that is nearly 120 years after Bernard fitz TJnspac's first appear ance.

The same may be said of a deed15 which I shall now quote, and which refers to a period when John de Brompton was not as yet heir-apparent of his Father Brian, but had an elder Brother Simon living. By the said deed \" Roger de Kinlet renders to Sir Brian his Brother, Norton, a part of his (Brian's) Manor of Kinlet, which part Roger had in custody for his life' from Sir Brian his Brother.10 Roger also renders up his share of Kinlet. He further testifies that the said Brian, in his presence, had given the same land, viz. Norton, together with a part of the wood of Kinlet, and together with his (Brian's) Manor of Walton17 in Somersetshire, to John his (Brian's) son, and at Roger's petition. Further, the said Sir Brian, in his Court, had received the homage of the aforesaid John, and had caused Simon his Son and Heir also to receive the homage of John, his (Simon's) Brother. And to the end that there should be no tergiversation thereafter on the part of Roger, he himself as a lawful witness of this donation, attached his seal to the Writing.\" 18 This deed is one of a class common in the reign of Henry II, and an example of which has been given already.19 \u2014 A Tenant wishing to convey his estate to another (in this instance to make provision for the younger of two nephews), does not do it by direct transfer, but by a kind of surrender-in-trust to the Suzerain. In 1193 the Sheriff of Shropshire enters on his account an amercement of 2 merks inflicted on Roger de Killet for difforciament, and adds that the sum should be required from the Sheriff of Worcestershire, who had received it.20 John de Bkompton succeeded to the general estate of his Father sometime between 1179 and 11 93, his elder Brother Simon having, I presume, died without issue.

The first steps in this suit are \u2014 an Essoign because of John de Bramton's alleged illness at Bramton, which Essoign was withdrawn before View had been made thereof; \u2014 an interpellation by Roger de Mortimer as Seigno ral Lord of Kinlet, who before Geoffrey fitz Piers (Chief Justice of England) claimed to try the cause in his own Court ; \u2014 and a writ from the Chief Justice staying further process at Westminster. Nevertheless, on October 13, 1199, a day (viz. November 17) was given in the Curia Regis to the Litigants, on which they were to come and take their chirograph in a plea of land in Kilet, and sub sequently another day, viz. Feb. 10, 1200, was given for the same purpose. In the last instance Margery, a daughter of John de Brompton, was ordered to appear in Court to give evidence of an exchange which had been made as to the premises in dispute.21 A deed of about this period comes in very appropriately here, not in respect of the above litigation, but to show what became of Mar gery, John de Brompton's daughter. Thereby \u2014 '\u2022 John de Brarnp ton grants to Margaret, his daughter, whom Hugh de Turbervile hath taken to wife, all his (John's) part of Flavel.22 \u2014 Witnesses : Sir William de Braose, William, his son, Stephen de Evereus (De vereux) .\" 23 This Deed aptly introduces another wherein mention is made of Matilda de Braose, John de Brompton's wife. She was, I take it, Daughter of one and Sister of another of the above witnesses. The Deed which probably passed on the death of this Lady, I can find only in an abridged form. It runs thus. \u2014 \" I, John de Bromton, have given to the Church of All Saints of Kinlet, and to the Canons of Wigmore, for the Soul of Matildis de Breus, my wife (spons\u00e6 mece), a part of my land in Kinlet, and a sum of 5s. on my said wife's an niversary.\" Matilda de Braose is said, on good authority,24 to have beeu Widow of Sir Henry de Tracy.

Of these Manors, Kinlet, Brompton Brian, and Aldritone, had been held by Richard at Domesday.

As to Tocheham and Idbury, they had been held under Mortimer by one Oide lard at Domesday. I think they descended to Brian de Brompton from Neufmesnil, and that Neufmesnil was the descendant of Oidelard. Botley, in Hampshire, was held under Mortimer.

The difference was perhaps in part supplied by a recognised encroachment on the King's Manor of Stottesden. More probably some part of the neighbour ing Forest of Wyre, or of the suppressed Manors of Richard's-Neen and Wall-Town, had been apportioned to Kinlet by license of the Suzerain.

It was probably in anticipation of his immediate death that Sir Brian made his last W01 and Testament, dated on Sunday, July 27, 1287. Thereby he bequeaths \"his body to be buried in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin, in the Monastery of Wigmore, near the tomb of his Mother, Alice.\" He appoints his eldest son (filium meum primogenitum), Sir Walter, and Sir Peter Corbet, his Executors; but his wife, Dame Sara, and his son, \" Brother Hugh,\" are to superintend the said Executors, and no thing of consequence (nihil notabile) is to be done without the counsel and consent of these superintendents.43 Sir Walter de Brompton now succeeded his Father, Sir Brian. A Charter of his, wherein he styles himself \" Walter de Bromton, Knight, Lord of Bocton,\" bears date at Ludlow, in 16 Edw. I (i. e between November, 1287, and November, 1288).44 - In the following year (17 Edw. I), Walter de Bromton and John de Bromton, Knights, together with Richard de la Bane, acknow ledge their joint obligation to repay 40s. of the money received on loan from Laurence de Ludlowe, on the 1st of August, 1289, at his House in Ludlowe.45 We learn from another Deed that Sara, widow of Sir Brian de Bromton, released to Sir Walter de Bromton, all claim of dower in Bromton, Stanage, Stowe, Weston, Ayeston (Aston, Herefordshire), and Idesberie, so that she might have Kiu lett, and a tenement in the New Park at Knowle, and a Salt-rent at Wich, for her dower.40 We know from an Inquisition of a much later date that Sara, widow of Brian de Brompton, retained Kinlet till her death.47 Sir Walter de Brompton seems to have died between the years 1289 and 1292. His successor was a fourth \u2014 Sir Brian de Brompton, whom I should have supposed to have been his Brother, were it not for a piece of evidence which con vinces me that he was his Son. \u2014 The Mother's name of Sir Brian (iv) was Joane, not Emma or Sara, so that it is clear that he was not a son of Sir Brian (in), consequently not Brother of Sir Walter.

I have assumed above that this Brian de Brompton was he who served under Roger de Mortimer in 1277. He had otherwise oc curred in the lifetime of his Father and Grandfather, if the verdict of a local Jury may be taken as correct. Apparently he had held, in 1284, some land near Kinlet, perhaps by feoffment of his Grand father. At all events he was stated by the Jurors of Stottesden Hundred, in 1292, to have appropriated three acres of the King's Fee in the Manor of Stottesden eight years previously. The value of the land was Is. per annum. Brian had also, said the Jurors, enclosed two years previously a high-road which led from Chorley towards Strongeford, Kynlet, Kidderminster, and Worcester. As to the first charge, Brian replied that Stottesden was in possession of John de Segrave, who might sue him if he chose. As to the road, he said that a straighter and more convenient road was still open. This the Jurors denied. The old road was therefore ordered to be reopened, and Brian was in misericordid?0 On December 28, 1291, Brian de Brompton, the last of the elder male line of his House, was deceased. A Writ of Diem clausit ex tremum was issued on the said day by Edward I, then at Abercon way. The Jurors who reported his Shropshire Tenures on February 28, 1295, said that he had held twenty acres of the King in capite in Kinlet Park, by service of a twentieth part of a Knight's Fee, that he had done homage to the King for the said Tenure, which was worth 6s. per annum?1 It was this holding evidently which had induced the Writ of Diem clausit extremum. The land in ques tion had probably been thrown into Kinlet Park at a very remote period, having been originally a portion of Stottesden. The de ceased, continued the Jurors, had held three acres (value Is. per annum) in the same Park, of the King and of the Fee of Stottes- 48 * \u2022\u00bb Blakeway's MSS.

Several other Manors held by the deceased are valued, but Kinlet itself is omitted, being probably still held in dower by Sara, widow of the Deceased's Grandfather. The deceased left two daughters, his Coheirs; \u2014 the elder, Margaret, born October 27, 1293, was now little more than a year old ; the younger, Elizabeth, born December 16, 1294, was less than three months old. It is astonishing, when we look at the great Estates of the Bromp tons, that a single tenure in capite of 20 acres, by knights'-service, should have entitled the Crown to a control over all. An Escheator's Roll of 1294-5 carefully records the fact that \" land in Kynlet Park, Salop, late Brian de Brompton's, viz. 20 acres, is held of the King in capite for a twentieth part of a knight's-fee.\"52 This gave the King a right to dispose of the daughters of the last Brian de Bromp ton in Marriage. Margaret, not yet three years of age, was thus bestowed by Patent, dated June 21, 1296.53 The King gave her in marriage to \"his beloved Clerk,\" Malcolm de Harley, for the behoof of Robert de Harley, nephew of the said Malcolm, and son of that Richard de Harley whom I have so often mentioned in these pages as husband of the Heiress of Willey. In 1300 I find mention of the death of one John de Brompton, said to have held of the heir of Walter de Brompton then a ward of the Crown.54 This John was, I think, brother of Sir Walter, and his tenure in 1300 was, strictly speaking, under the Granddaughters and coheirs of the said Walter. At all events the Escheator ultra Trent was ordered to seize his lands for the King, as having his Suzerain or Suzerains in custody. A King's Writ of October 10, 1304, orders the Escheator ultra Trent to extend or value all lands, seized into the King's hand and for merly held by Brian de Brompton, deceased. An extent of Kinlet was consequently taken on Dec. 5. A messuage and garden, Water- Mill, two carucates, or 120 acres, of land worth 20s. per annum, at 2d. per acre, a carucate of land newly brought into cultivation by Walter Hakelut, a Park containing 100 acres (reckoned by the short hundred), \u2014 these were some of the items which realized a total annual value of \u00a314. 12s. 9d. The principal Tenants in the Manor were John de Arderne, John Bernard, Roger de Bradeleye, William de Wynnewode, and Thomas de Elnecote.55 A Feodary, drawn up after the death of Edmund de Mortimer, viz. on 10 Feb. 1305, re- 52 Kirby's Quest.\u2014 Escheats 22 and 23 54 Originalia, I, 110. 55 Inquisitions, 33 Edw.

One of these is nearly illegible, but mentions Sarra de Foxcot and John Vicar of Kinlet, as holding lands in that Manor. Another values the Manor at \u00a325. 9s. 7d. per annum. A third values 23 acres in Kinlet Park at 7s. 8d. per annum?7 A Writ of King Edward II's followed these Inquests, reciting that Margaret, wife of Robert de Harley, was now of full age (she must have been under sixteen), and ordering the Escheator to give her and her husband full seizin of the following, viz. the Manor of Brompton, the Hamlet of Weston, the Manor of Bucton, 33s. rent in Stowe, all in the Marshes of Wales, certain land in Kinlet Park, Salop, and the Manor of Ashton, in Herefordshire.58 Hence came it to pass that in the beginning of the present Century, Brompton Bryan was in the hands of Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, as the lineal descendant of Robert de Harley and Mar garet de Brompton. I should now say something of Elizabeth, the other Coheiress of De Brompton. King Edward I, before the year 1300, entrusted Edmund de Cornwall with custody of all or great part of the lands, late Brian de Brompton's, till the heirs should be of full age. In consequence of this grant, Edmund de Cornwall was, in 1300, and afterwards, empowered to levy Scutage on the Tenants of these Es tates for several Armies of Scotland.59 This Edmund was the eldest son of Richard de Cornwall, which Richard was an illegitimate00 son of Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, the illus trious Brother of King Henry III.

The proofs offered for Richard de Cornwall's legitimacy seem to be that Edmund Earl of Cornwall called one of the said Rich ard's sons \" Nephew ;\" and King Edward II called another son \" Cousin,\" \u2014 which are no proofs at all.

King Edward II, order ing that Edmund de Cornwall should have power to collect the ar rears of such Scutages as he was entitled to as aforesaid, calls him his beloved Cousin.61 I here suspend a narrative which would in volve many further details before I coidd arrive at the mode in which partition of the Brompton estates was ultimately settled between the Coheirs. Suffice it to say that whde the Feodary of 1316 -gives Edmund de Cornwall as Joint Lord of Ashton (Herefordshire) and of Idbury, Foxcote, and other estates in Oxfordshire, it treats the Manor of Kinlet as if it were still in the hands of the Lord Para mount, \u2014 Roger de Mortimer.62 Nevertheless Kinlet, as held under Mortimer, was wholly allotted, previously or subsequently, to the purparty of Elizabeth, wife of Edmund de Cornwall, and so descended to her heirs. Of Undertenants in Kinlet, very few notices occur, and those have been in great part already given in connection with the history of the Mesne-Lords. In 1252 I find Walter fitz Nicholas, of Kinlet, fining i merk for some Writ.63 THE CHURCH. The French Chronicle of Wigmore gives us the first information about Kinlet Church, saying that John de Brompton gave it to that Abbey.64 If this was so, the gift took place probably soon after 1179. The same Chronicle, a little lower down, names the Church of Kynleth, apparently among those given to the Abbey by Hugh de Mortimer.64 He, as we have seen, died in 1181. There is little of contradiction in these statements, for the Grant of an Advowson usuaUy necessitated the concurrence of the Seignoral Lord. From Sunday, Aprd 16, to Tuesday, April 18, 1290, Bishop Swinfield, then visiting his Diocese, was at Kinlet. The Abbot of Wigmore, Rector of Kinlet as he is called, supplied corn, and fuel for baking bread, to the Bishop's Suite, besides forage and litter for the thirty-six horses of his train. The party had to send to Kidder minster for other provisions. Their purveyor paid Id. to the Guide, who may be supposed to have led him through the Forest of Wyre, and 4cl. for crossing and recrossing the Severn by a ferry. A matter of far greater interest is associated with Bishop Swinfield's visit to 63 Rot. Pip. 36 Hen.

His letter bears date at Kinlet on the 18th, but its prayer was not complied with till May, 1320, when another Bishop occupied the See of Hereford, another King the throne of England, and another Pope the Chair of St. Peter.65 In 1291 the Church of Kynleth (that is, the Rectory thereof) is set down as the Abbot of Wigmore's, and valued at \u00a310.

The reasons of the diminution were, \u2014 because the Abbot of Wigmore, Rector of the Church, had two carucates of land, his glebe as it were, of the annual value of \u00a35. 6s. 8d. Also the tithes of hay, oblations, and small tithes were worth \u00a33. ls. 4'rf.67 In 1534-5 the preferment of Thomas Mason, Vicar of Kynlett, was valued at \u00a38. 10s., in glebe and Tithes, a sum chargeable with 7s. 8d., for Procurations and Synodals.68 The Abbot of Wigmore's cotemporary return does not specifically acknowledge the receipt of any great tithes from Kinlet. It is probable however that his re ceipts in the way of tithes from Kinlet are included in the total of \u00a316. 16s., said to arise from \" Cleobury Mortimer, Neen Monell, and Morehall.\"69 EARLY INCUMBENTS.*1 The Abbot and Convent of Wigmore exercised the right of patronage in each of the undermentioned cases, except where the contrary is expressed.

Brian got judg ment on the ground that Herbert de Gerys had only been Tenant at-Will of Brian de Brompton, the Defendant's Father.73 UPPER AND LOWER MEATON. An estate in Great Metene was in 1281 held under Brian de Brompton by Adam de Kyngeshemede, nephew and heir of another Adam. Roger de Mortimer, Senior, required the services due on this land from the Tenant in possession, not from the Mesne Lord, and distrained for the same. The said services were due on a mes suage and virgate, and were in the proportion oi lid. when a scutage of 40s. per knight's-fee was being collected. Adam de Kyngeshe mede now sued Brian de Brompton as Mesne Lord, to acquit him of all such liability to the Lord Paramount. By a Fine levied in Easter Term, 1281, Brian engages so to do, and acknowledges the right of Adam in the said Tenement as heir to his Uncle, and as holding the same by 4-d. rent. Adam in return remits all damages arising out of the distress aforesaid.74 Batons This introduces to our notice a series of six Manors in Condetret Hundred, which, at the time of Domesday, were held by Ralph de Mortemer, not of the King, but of the Norman Earl.\u2014\" The same Radulf (de Mortemer) holds (of the Earl) Barbingi, and Fech (holds 73 Assizes, 56 Hen.

One virgate of these two (virgates comprised in half a hide) used to lie in Claiberie. Here now n Radmans and ii Boors have one ox-team. The former value (of the Manor) was 10s. : its present value is 6s.\"1 The distinction between the two virgates which composed this Manor was probably thus notified be cause Cleobury Mortimer was now held in capite of the King. The original Manor of Cleobury had therefore lost a virgate. Of Fech the Saxon I have already spoken under Mawley. He had been Lord of the Worcestershire Manor of Broc, but Mortimer held that at Domesday, and apparently Fech was no longer interested there as Tenant. Baveney came to be held under Mortimer by a family called De Ribbesford, being also Mortimer's Feoffees at Ribbesford in Worcestershire. Of these the first who occurs is Simon de Rib beford, that Seneschal of Roger de Mortimer who in 1 1 79 was in volved in his Lord's concern with the death of Cadwallan, Prince of Wales.3 Again Henry and Tristram de Ribbeford occur in Morti mer's affairs in Nov. 1221, as we shall presently see under Higley. Again, Henry de Ribbesford, or Ripeford, occurs in 1235 and about 1240, as holding three parts of a knight's-fee in Ribbesford under Ralph de Mortimer.3 On November 7, 1246, Simon de Ribeford occurs on an inquest at Higley,4 and in or about March, 1259, the same person was appointed a Justice for the Gaol.- delivery of Salop and Brug.5 Between 1268 and 1274 Henry de Ribbesford attests a Worcestershire Deed.6 William de Bardeley, who died in 1295, held a Tenement in Balbeneye under Sir Henry de Ribbeford at a rent of 2d? This same Sir Henry was apparently he who, on the death of Edmund de Mortimer, in 1304, was holding Babbeney by service of a third part of a knight's-fee,8 and who, on the 1st of De cember, 1310, presented Simon de Ribbesford to Ribbesford Church.9 Baveney passed eventually from this family to the Foxcotes, but the Ribbesfords remained at Ribbesford some generations longer.

In the time of Henry II this Manor was held under Mortimer by one William de Hugley. This Wdliam had a son Helias and som- daughters. Helias de Hugley, living in and after 1194, was deceased in 1203 without issue, so that his four Sisters or their Re presentatives became his heirs. These Sisters were, (1) Cecilia wife of * * * de Wudeton, (2) a Sister unnamed, but wife of * * * de Burley, (3) another Sister unnamed, and whose husband is also un named, but whose daughter, commonly called Margery de Chabbe nore, was the wife of Thomas fitz Odo, (4) Sibil who, being uni formly styled Sibil de Hugley, was perhaps never married. How Higley was at first divided among these Coheiresses I cannot say, but certain it is that one complete moiety went to Sibil. Sibil, evi dently single at the time, occurs in 1203, as essoigning her attend ance at the County Assizes under the common summons? When the next Assizes were held, viz. in November, 1221, Sibil de Hugley had been more than a year deceased, and without issue ; and her estate (a moiety of Higley) came to be litigated among the repre sentatives of her three Sisters, each claimant asserting a title to one sixth of the whole Manor. The proceedings are rendered rather complex by the circumstance that Hugh de Mortimer, as Seigneural Lord, affected to settle the matter in his own Court. The details of the litigation may with these prefatory remarks speak for them selves. \u2014 William de Burley and Margery de Chabeuoure, nephew and niece of Sibil de Hugley, had entered a suit of mort d'ancestre against Robert de Wunerton (Wodeton) for half the vill of Hugley of which they alleged their said Aunt to have died seized. William de Burley now withdrew from the suit, but being called into Court was pronounced, with his sureties, to be in misericordid.

The Court decided that the present Suit should await the issue of the other.4 The other suit was tried later at the Assizes, and the Record thereof is a most instructive document.5 \u2014 Robert de Witton (Wodeton) sued Hugh de Mortimer, Henry de Ribbeford, William de Burley, Tristram de Ribbeford, Thomas Clerk, and Nicholas de Ernewude for disseizing him of Ids free tenement in Hugley. The Defendants having said nothing why the trial should not proceed, the Jurors found as follows : \u2014 \" That when Sibil, youngest daughter of William de Hugley, died, she having had a fourth part of the inheritance of her brother Helias, and so dying without issue, Robert de Witton (as being son of William de Witton, Clerk, son of Cecilia, eldest sister of Sibil) and William Burnel (read Burley) and Margery de Chabbenour, with Christiana her Sister, being descended from the two other Sisters of Sibil, went to Hugh de Mortimer, the Chief Lord, to Wigmore, and proposed to give the said Hugh 30 merks as their joint Fine for Sibil's inheritance : \u2014 that Robert de Witton asserted on that occasion that he had never yet received an equitable share under the former apportionment (viz. on Helias de Hugley's death) ; for that while the other Coparceners had had 2 carucates of land apiece he had had but one, and he wanted computation to be made, and his loss under the first division to be recompensed now : \u2014 that to this William de Burley, Margery, and Christiana objected, saying that the present division was the only matter to be settled ; \u2014 that, Robert de Witton persisting in his demand for a general compu tation, Hugh de Mortimer gave them a day at Higley, and sent his Knights there to hear their computation, but that no agreement could be arrived at \u2022 \u2014 that then Robert de Witton went to Wig more and fined 40 merks with Hugh de Mortimer that he might have seizin of the whole premises, and that Mortimer might receive his homage : all however on condition that he (Robert), being seized, should give their just shares to the other claimants according to the consideration of Hugh's Court; \u2014 that Mortimer received his homage, and put him in seizin \u2022\u2014 that William de Burley and Mar gery were present, and still persisted in offering their homage, which it seems was not taken, for Robert asserted his right to 1 Aissizes, 6 Hon.

Robert de Wudeton may have been a Minor at the time of Helias de Hugley's death, but his Father was living, and so it is difficult to account for the injustice alleged to have been suffered in the original division. Mortimer's conduct in the present in stance appears to have been both vigorous, sensible, and just. Whatever form the ultimate sentence of the Court took, it is evi dent that the moiety of Higley thus litigated continued in three portions, each being a sixth of the whole Manor, but it appears that Robert de Witton and Margery de Chabbenour, at a subse quent period, neglected to perform the capital services due on their shares, and that Mortimer ousted them both. Hence another liti gation. \u2014 On Oct. 27, 1225, Margery de Chabenore and Robert de Witton name their Attorneys in the plea of land which they had against Hugh de Mortimer and others.6 On Jan. 26 (1226 as I suppose) Hugh de Mortimer essoigns himself in the plea of intrusion which Robert de Wudeton and Margery de Chabenour had against him. A day was given to the parties, viz. Feb. 23.7 In the same term, 1226, Hugh de Mortimer (being attached to answer these Plaintiffs as to wherefore he had intruded himself into a third part of half a Knight's-fee in Hugele, which Robert de Wudeton claimed, and into one-sixth of a knight's-fee in the same, which parts the said Robert and Margery had on a previous occasion recovered against Mortimer before the Justices itinerant) appeared to the charge. He acknowdedged the previous recovery by the Plaintiffs, and con ceded to them their seizin, saying that he claimed nothing thereof but the services due. The Court awarded to Robert de Wudeton such seizin of his third of a moiety of the Manor as he had for- 7 Placita incerti temporis Regis Jo nannis (so labelled), m. 2 dorso. 6 Placita, Mich.

As to Margery de Chabenouris claim, it appeared that, in the Writ originally sued out by her, Richard de Middlehop and Avice his wife were named as parties to her cause, and should have been now present. This part of the matter was adjourned to May 10, when the said Richard and Avice were to appear in Court. Meanwhile Margery's sixth share was to be in manu Regis? On May 10 it came out why Richard and Avice had not joined with Margery, who was, in fact, Avice's Mother. They claimed the impounded sixth as their own entirely, saying that Margery had given all her right thereto in frank-marriage with Avice, and so they (Richard and Avice) had entered therein when Margery first recovered seizin. Margery now denied the alleged gift in frank marriage, and demanded her seizin. She recovered it, and Richard de Middlehope was in misericordid? At this juncture then, all that we can conclude about Higley is that it was divided into two moieties. The holder of the first moiety has not appeared in these proceedings as such ; the second moiety was subdivided into three shares, held respectively by Wdliam de Burley, Robert de Wodeton, and Margery de Chabbe nur; for of Constancia, Margery's Sister, we have ceased to hear. We next find the Manor mentioned as if divided into two moieties only, of which Robert de Wodeton had one ; the other, after some litigation, was ceded to Roger de Burwardsley as heir thereof, but by what mode of descent it is difficult to conjecture. The facts and appearances are these. In a deed already quoted, as of date about 1225,10 Philip de Burwardsley and Robert de Wodetun follow each other in the testing-clause of a deed in which it is difficult to dis cover any interest of Robert de Wudeton, except that he may have been connected with some of the other parties : with Philip de Bur wardsley, for instance. On the 30th of August, 1228, the King appoints Justices to try a cause between Roger de Burwardsley and Ralph de Mortimer (of Wigmore) , concerning a tenement in Huggele.11 The Commission is renewed on May 10, 1229, the suit being described as one of mort d'ancestre?2 which shows, as I have before suggested,13 that Roger de Burwardsley must have claimed through his Mother ; for Philip, his elder and probably half-brother, was living at the time.

Hence perhaps it was that Isabella de Mortimer, in 1247, had fined 40s. \"to have an In quisition;\"19 \u2014 for an Inquest taken in the Church of Huggele on November 7, 1246, stated (in reply to a Writ of Henry de Wing ham, addressed to Sir William Hunaud, Escheator of Shropshire) that Robert de Wodeton had held half the Manor of Huggele by half a knight's-fee, under IsabeUa de Mortimer, to whom Hugh son of Roger de Mortimer, had assigned the same in dower. The Tenant-interest was valued at \u00a37. 10s. per annum.20 A King's Writ, on Dec. 9, 1246, recites accordingly that the King is assured that Hugh de Mortimer had assigned to Isabel, relict of Roger de Mortimer, dower in half a fee held by R. de Wudeton in Hugley ; and the Escheator is ordered to give custody thereof to the said IsabeUa.-1 In 1255 Robert de Lacy appears as sole Lord of Hugele, but how it came to him I cannot say, unless it were that Amice, sole 14 Pedes Finium, 21 Hen.

It was held of Roger de Mortimer by service of doing ward for one knight's-fee at Wigmore Castle in time of war, viz. for forty days.22 I have spoken of Robert de Lacy under various relations and dates, viz. in 1256, 1262, and 1267.23 I shaU hereafter have more to say of him. On August 22nd, 1268, he takes out a Writ of novel disseizin against Roger de Mortimer concerning his tenement in Huggele,24 which I think to have been in the hands of the Suzerain, by reason of Lacy's real or alleged disloyalty during the Barons' war. A second Patent, dated Oct. 10, 1268, declares that Robert de Lacy had faithfully adhered to the King during the late disturbances, and orders that he be not molested with any unjust suspicions, but have indemnity for all his losses.24 In August, 1271, apparently, \" Amicia de Wodyntone, daughter of Robert formerly Lord of Wodyntone, in her widowhood, quit claims to Roger de Mortimer her Manor of Huggeley, which she held of him.

It is dated at Gloucester, August 11, 1271, and, I presume, fixes the date of the above Deed.26 By Deed dated at Kyngeslane in June, 1307, Roger de Morti mer gives to Dame Margaret, his Mother, the land of Kery and the Manor of Norton near Presthemede, whde she renounces her dower in Hugleye and other places.

THE CHURCH. There was a Church here early in the twelfth century, though Domesday does not mention one in the eleventh. Between the years 1143 and 1148 the Lord of Higley, that is, Hugh de Mor timer's Feoffee there, at the request of the said Hugh, gave the Church of Huggeley to certain Augustine Canons then settled at Shobdon under their Prior Robert, and one day enjoying the patronage, another day suffering from the persecution of Mortimer. This gift took place at a great assembly at Leominster presided over by Robert de Betun, Bishop of Hereford.34 Though Mor timer's fit of piety soon passed away, the gift of the Lord of Higley endured, and when, in 1179, the Shobdon Canons definitely settled at Wigmore, Mortimer confirmed Higley Church to the Abbey.35 So the Church-Taxation of 1291 says that the Church of Hug leye in the Deanery of Stottesden is the Abbot of Wigmore's, and is worth \u00a32. 13s. 4d. per annum?6 The Inquisition of 1341 quotes this Taxation and assesses the Parish at 22s. to the Ninth.

Richard de Overton has already been mentioned as a Visor of works at Brug Castle in 1193,2 the period at which his presumed brother-in-law occupied a prominent position in County affairs. In 1198, Richard de Overton was amerced half a merk for disseizin.

About this time he is set down as holding a Knight's Fee in Overton, Eudon (George), and Cornley (Corley), under Mortimer of Wigmore.7 There seems at this period to have been some litigation among the Coheirs of Le Savage as to their respective rights. Wdliam de St. George's Quit claim to Ralph de Mortimer has been already set forth,8 and though the Manor of Overton is included, the name of Geoffrey de Overton is not mentioned as Tenant thereof. The Deed must therefore be taken as a transaction between the Suzerain, and one of several Tenants, not as indicating any composition among the Tenants themselves. However it is clear that about this time some Aveighty matter abided a legal decision, in which Geoffrey de Overton was concerned, for at Michaelmas, 1241, he had fined the unusual sum of fifteen merks that the King might order some Inquisition.9 His attestation of a Pickthorn deed in 1241-2, as Sir Geoffrey de Hu varatun,10 should be noticed before I pass to some occurrences of a Geoffrey de Overton who possibly may have been the same person, but more probably his son and Successor. \u2014 In 1251, Geoffrey de Overton was impleading WUliam de St. George about a Tenement in Eudon.11 In the same year, Geoffrey de Overton had been amerced half a merk for transgression, and Stephen de Overton had fined 30s. for a Writ of Attaint?2 This was against the Verdict of a Jury, and related to property in Neen Savage, as I have shown under that Manor.13 In 1255, Geoffrey de Overton was returned as Lord of Overton, which he held of Roger de Mortimer for half a knight's-fee. The Manor contained 1| hides, did suit to Stottesden Hundred, and paid the Sheriff 6d. for Stretward, and 12d. for Motfee?4, Geoffrey de Overton's co temporary interest in Eudon George, Corley, and Neen Savage, are set forth under those localities. In Neen Savage he is mentioned, together with his Son Nicholas; but in 1256, we find that he had two sons, William and Nicholas, both mentioned under Eudon George.15 At the Assizes of that year, Geoffrey de Overton names his son WiUiam, his Attorney, in a Suit of land against Robert Corbet.16 The latest that I find of Sir Geoffrey de Overton is per- 7 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 8 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 52. \u00bb Rot.

There were at least seven such Manors,2 and one of them was the Hampshire Manor of Anne. Now, when I say that in each of these seven Manors Ingelrann was succeeded by Le Savage, I fortify my former presumption3 that Ingelrann was the Ancestor of that Famdy. Be sides these seven Manors I can name four4 not held by Ingelrann at Domesday, but in which Le Savage or his Coheirs had, or seem to have had, a subsequent Interest. These four Manors were held among four distinct Domesday Tenants, whom I do not reckon to have been Ancestors of Le Savage, but think that Le Savage's Fief was increased after Domesday by several grants of the Suzerain, as Manors from time to time came to his redisposal. Of the eleven Manors which form the above two classes, I observe that in Saxon times four5 had been held by Edric Savage, but this I think to be accidental, and not to imply any blood descent from Edric Savage to Ingelrannus or the Savages. All Edric's Manors did not come to Mortimer, and of those which did, the majority are not subse quently found to be held by Ingelrann, or by his descendants. Therefore the genealogical temptation which I have before alluded to,6 and which might induce us to recognise an ancestor of Le Savage in Edric Savage, must be resisted. I find no cotemporary Record (further than the name) that speaks of Walton Savage at the time when it was held by Le Savage.

Motfee.\"7 King Henry III, by Charter dated at Windsor, Oct. 4, 1265, granted to the Abbot and Convent of Wigmore, that they and their Tenants at Shobdon (Herefordshire), and at Kayham and Walton (Shropshire), \" which estates they had by gift of the Ancestors of Roger de Mortimer,\" should be quit of all Suits of County and Hundred, quit also of View of Frankpledge, Scott, Geld, Toll, and Aids of Sheriffs, or other Officers ; \u2014 also that they should appro priate the amerciaments of their own tenants, and all fines pro licentid concordandi, and all fines paid by persons arrested within the said Manors in lieu of imprisonment, whatever were the offence for which they should be imprisoned ; \u2014 saving only all attachments for Pleas of the Crown.8 On the strength of this Charter, and soon after it passed, that is after the siege of Kenilworth, the Abbot of Wigmore withdrew the Suit of Walton from Stottesden Hundred, as also did he withdraw the Suit of Caynham from Overs Hundred,9 thus imitating his Patron Roger de Mortimer in an attempt to estabUsh the indepen dence of his Manors. In 1291, the Abbot of Wigmore's assized rents in Walton were \u00a33. 3s. 9\\d. He had also rents there apper taining to vesture (profits on woodland, I suppose) amounting to \u00a31. 6s. 8d.

Mr. Blakeway follows up this idea by a description of a Roman encampment at Wall Town, conspicuous in his day, and still clearly traceable, but which he says had at the time he wrote escaped general notice. It was in the form of an exact square, each side measuring 400 feet. The old road from Bridgnorth to Cleobury passed right through its centre, entering at the Pr\u00e6torian and passing out at the Decuman Gate. The present Road goes out at the South-East corner. No coins or other remains had been discovered in Mr. Blakeway's time. He notices that in digging out a Cellar for a farm-house,1 the soil was observed to be very black, and was evidently mixed with charcoal. There can be little doubt that Wall-Town, now a member of Neen Savage, was represented by the Domesday Manor of WaUe. \u2014 \" The same Radulf (de Mortemer) holds (of the Earl) WaUe, and Richard holds it of him. Uluric held it (in Saxon times). Here is one hide geldable. There is arable land sufficient for two ox teams. Here there is one (such team), with n Neatherds. Its for mer value was 6s. Now it is worth 8s. (per annum).\"2 It will be remembered that Uluric the Saxon had been Lord of a part of Neen, and that that part was held by Richard at Domesday. It seems to me that nothing of these two Tenures of Richard's descended to the Bromptons, nor yet were they annexed to Le Savage's share of Neen. The bulk of them was, I think, annexed to the demesne of Cleobury Mortimer, a part was given to Wigmore Abbey, and the residue became the subject of several minor feoffments or other transactions in which the Suzerain is constantly interested.- \u2014 And here I must speak of Wall-Town, Elcott, and Nethercott, col lectively, as also of a place called Rochull, near to Wall-Town.

Bewdley Forest, under its more ancient appellation of Wyre, was a district so vast as that a whole County got its name therefrom ; for Wyre-ceastre (Worcester) was a Roman station in this Forest, and becoming the chief City of the district, that district was called Worcestershire. I am now to notice the Forest of Wyre as greatly reduced from this primeval state ; \u2014 no longer extending along the Severn to Worcester, but being rather in Shropshire than Worces tershire; \u2014 that is, while its southern and smaUer half was in the latter County, its greater half occupied the south-eastern angle of Shropshire. This greater half is that which I must needs notice as forming a principal feature in the territory which owned the Seigneury of Mortimer. I have more than once observed that Domesday tells us nothing of these Forest-lands, neither of their state in Saxon times nor of their assignment under the Normans. What we are not told can however easily be inferred in the case before us. There 10 Placita coram Rege, 50 Hen. Ill, m. I 7, and 52 Hen. Ill, m. 9.

They were Stottesden, Higley, Cleobury, and Kinlet, the two first belonging to the Earldom of Mercia, the two last to the Saxon Crown. The two last arc nearer to Wyre Forest than the two first, and the greater the Forest the more likely was it to belong to a King than an Earl. I therefore assume that in Saxon times the Shropshire part of Wyre Forest was attached to Cleobury and Kin let, that it went with both Manors to William fitz Osbern, Earl of Hereford, then to Ralph de Mortimer, but that when Mortimer en feoffed a Tenant in Kinlet, he retained the Forest or the bulk of it as an adjunct of his demesne-manor of Cleobury. I should observe that the proper and technical designation of a Forest w hen no longer held by the Crown was a Chace, and the fact that Wyre was yet called a Forest after it was dissevered from the Crown is only an additional proof of its sometime Royal ownership. In process of time, and under the rule of Mortimer, several Vills sprang up within the Forest of Wyre which are unnoticed in Domesday, obviously be cause they were not then in existence. One of these, Earnwood (i. e. eagle-wood), bears in its very name a conviction that the spot was so caUed before it was known as a habitation of man. Of this vill, which I cannot properly class as a member of any Domesday Manor, I will speak presently. I will here proceed at once to the only Re cord which tells us of Mortimer's progressive dealings with this Forest as a whole, and di the jurisdiction which he endeavoured to maintain, obviously as Lord of a Forest sometime Royal. At the time (1270) when Prince Edward was embarking for Palestine, the Forest of Wyre was fenced for miles, so as to prevent any depreda tions of the beasts of chase in the cultivated districts adjoining. Roger de Mortimer, the hero of Evesham, took occasion of his great position, to enlarge or revive his rights as the case may have been. Before the close of the year 1274 he had leveUed no less than two lea<mes of the above fence, so that the beasts of the Forest, going in and out at pleasure, wrought the greatest havoc throughout the country. Moreover, he arrogated to himself a right of free chace, not only in Wyre Forest, but in the Manors of his Tenants at Kinlet and Baveney. Even Sir Nicholas de Segrave, the King's Tenant of Stottesden, and another King's Tenant at Bardley could no longer call their woods their own. No one dared to hunt in those woods because of Mortimer's asserted jurisdiction. \" Thus,\""], [746, "278 FOREST OF WYRE. EARNWOOD. said the Stottesden Jurors of 1274, \" has Roger de Mortimer ex ceeded the Umits and boundaries of his Chace.\"1 This testimony of the Stottesden Jurors is curiously illustrated by a coeval document of a very different nature, but showing another mode in which the dormant jurisdiction was being revived. By a deed dated at Lichfield on April 21, 1270, Ralph, the Dean, and the Chapter of Lichfield recite how Sir Roger de Mortimer had given them license to fence a wood called Sechele,2 which was within his Free Chace of Wyre, but belonged to the Dean and Chapter's Church of Arle (Upper Arley). They covenant to remove the fence at the end of seven years, commencing on Trinity Sunday 1270.3 I have nothing further to relate as to the success of Mortimer's attempt to revive a quasi-royal status for the Forest of Wyre. When I come to speak of the Forest of the Clee-Hill, which, having been likewise Royal, was given to the Cliffords, the attempted maintenance of a similar jurisdiction wdl, with aU its grievances, more circumstantially appear. EARNWOOD. Earnwood, now a Manor in the Parish of Kinlet, was originally a Forest-residence (with a Park attached) of the Mortimers. On February 13, 1225, King Henry III commands Hugh de Nevill (he was Justice of the Forest) to let Hugh de Mortimer have ten Does (damas) from Feckenham (a Royal Forest in Worcestershire) which the King has given him towards stocking his Park of Erne wud.* In Trinity Term 1251 Roger de Ernewude and MariUa his wife, Deforciants of half a virgate in \" Maubeg, near the great Park of Wyre,\" concede the same by fine, and as their gift, to Lucas le Marescall, who is to hold it of the Lord of the Fee. The Pur chaser, for such he clearly was, gives 20 merks to the Vendors.5 Mortimer then had allowed a partial occupation of this district for agricultural purposes. We next hear of his using his own Ma nor House of Ernewoode somewhat in the way of a prison. He conveyed Henry de Pembruge hither, probably to complete certain purposes of extortion which I have before set forth.6 This was in 1267.

Jjmton* After an enumeration of Rainald the Sheriff's Alnodestreu Ma nors, Domesday mentions two in Condetret Hundred, viz. Nortone and Dodintone, and then reverts to a Manor in Bascherch Hun dred, viz. Etbritone, which (apparently from some peculiarity in its status) had been omitted in its proper place, and reserved to the end of the list. Of Norton in Condetret Hundred, Domesday speaks thus : \u2014 \"The same Rainald (Sheriff) holds Nortone (of the Earl) and Toret (holds it) of him. He (Toret) held it freely in time of King Edward. Here are n hides geldable. In demesne there is i ox team and (there are) vi Serfs and v Villains, with ii teams and other two teams might yet be (employed) here. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 20s. per annum. Now it is worth 15s.\"1 There is no appearance of error in this part of the Domesday Record, Meaton, falls into the Severn close to Dowles. The vill took its name from the stream, and that name belongs to an older language than the Saxon (compare supra, p. 230).

As regards Nortone in Condetret Hundred, held by Toret in King Edward's time, and in 1086 held by the same Toret of Rainald, and which we expect to find afterwards Fitz Alan's, I must speak with some conjecture. I think it was Norton, adjoining Aston Botterell, another of Rainald's Manors ; and I first fortify this opinion by stating that Aston Bot terell contained i hide at Domesday and Nortone n hides, whdst in the Record of 1255 Aston Botterell alone is estimated to contain in hides, and Norton is not mentioned, having been I suppose annexed to Aston,2 as it is at this day both parochially and manoriaUy. As to Toret's connection with Nortone, and its discontinuance as re gards Toret's descendants, that, so far from being inexplicable, is in keeping with all analogy. \u2014 I have before shown that the Norman policy was to remove even the most favoured Saxons from their ancient possessions,3 giving them something elsewhere, and that this work went on after Domesday was compiled. Of Toret we know specifically that his descendants inherited estates which were not his at Domesday, and conversely, that they did not inherit all which ap pear as his in that Survey. Again the very name of Norton shows me that it was not originally a member of Aston Botterell, for it lies nearly south of the latter Vill, and must have been called North-toivn from some other ancient relation. I conclude then that Rainald or one of his Successors removed Toret or his descendants from Norton and annexed the Vill to the Fee of Aston BottereU. Of Aston Botterell as a whole, I have already given account. It remains to add one or two particulars as to this its member. I find one Walter de Norton (doubtless BottereU's Tenant here) attesting a Loughton Deed about 1268/ and sitting as a Juror of Stottesden Hundred at the Assizes of 1272 and again at the Inquest of 1274, when it appeared that Hugh Donvil, sometime Bailiff of the Hun dred, had taken 12c?. from him, and being so bribed had removed him from some panel? Moreover, John de la Watere, Constable of Corfham, had extorted 20s. from him, requiring him to give up the heir of his Brother, which heir he never saw. One John de Norton had also been accused of theft by John Bard (Under Sheriff) at in stigation of Roger, Clerk of Plesse (Receiver of the County) . Thus half a merk had been extorted from him. The Feodary of 1284 2 Vide supra, Vol. I, p. 225, note 19. i 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 107. 3 Supra, Vol. II, p. 49. 5 Rot. Bundred.

In 1165 the Record of Fees constituting the Barony of Fitz Alan mentions Hugh de Cunedoure as holding by the services of one Muntator? That his Feoffment lay in the quarter of Shropshire whereof we are now treating, is probable from his name being men tioned between those of Fitz- Alan's Feoffees at Brockton and Upton (Cressett) . Moreover, if Detton were not Hugh de Cunedoure's Fee, I am at a loss to conjecture what was, nor can I possibly fix upon any other name in this list of Feoffees as likely to represent the Lord of Detton. After an interval of sixty years a piece of evidence arises to strengthen this opinion that Hugh de Cunedoure was Lord of Detton. At the Assizes of November 1221 the Manor of Dodinton was subject to a trial by Grand Assize, Simon de Cone claiming it against Robert de Cunedour, the Tenant in possession.3 Robert's right was found to be the better, and Simon, with his Sureties (Ralph de la Low and Richard de BerdeU) were in misericordid. It is added that Thomas fitz Roger opposes, that is sinks, his claim.4 It is vain 6 Supra, Vol. I, p. 227. 7 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 216. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b, 1. 3 Assizes, 6 Hen.

Robert de Cunedour, of 1221, I take to have been representative of Hugh de Cunedour in 1165. The De- scendants of Robert de Cunedour assumed, I think, the name of Dodinton. There was one Adam de Dodinton who occurs under circumstances which associate him with this neighbourhood in 1226, 1242, and again between the latter year and 125 1.5 I do not how- ever think that he was Lord oi Detton, for about 1240 we have good assurance that Robert de Dodinton was holding Dodinton by half a knight's-fee (the usual equivalent to a whole Muntator' s Fee), of the Barony of Fitz Alan.6 This Robert seems to have been suc- ceeded by one John de Dodinton, and the latter to have died before 1255, leaving a son under age. Hence the Inquest of Stottesden Hundred, in 1255, reports of Dodyton, that Roger de Pynelesdon, as Custos of the son and heir of John de Dodyton, holds the Manor, he having that custody by grant of John fitz Alan (the Suzerain). The Manor was estimated to contain a hide and a half, and accor- dingly paid 6c/. for Stretward, and 12c?. for Motfee, but this esti- mate shows a decrease of half a hide from that oi Domesday. Dodyton did Suit to the Hundred.7 I find Robert de Dodinton (probably the Minor aforesaid) sitting as a Juror on the Beysin Inquest of September, 1263. The Inquisition on the death of the third John Fitz Alan, in 1272, is so defaced that I am obliged to appeal to an abstract thereof taken long since, and which places Dodinton among his Fees.8 At the Assizes of 1272 and the Inquest of 1274, Robert de Doditon sat as a Juror for Stottesden Hundred. Robert de Trill ec (Under Sheriff) had taken a bribe from him for removing him off some Jury. It was a ring worth 2s. In 1278 one Thomas de Dodinton sat at the Inquest on the death of Thomas de Bardley. Again, in 1280, we have had mention of Robert de Doditon (doubt less Lord of Detton), who with Isolda his wife, oppose (or sink) their claim to a part of the estate lately held by Philip de Farlow.9 It is probable that Isolda was a Coheiress in that estate. The Feodary of 1284 says of Dodington that \"Robert de Dodington holds it of Richard Fitz Alan, of the Honour of White-Minster, for half a knight's-fee, and the said Richard holds it of the King in capite.\"\u2122 In November, 1291, Robert de Dodinton sat on the Inquest after the death of Philip de Badger.

Some remains of this Structure were existent within memory.18 The district was parochially a member of Neen Savage, and where the Lords of two adjacent Manors were so essen tiaUy distinct as in the case before us, a Chapel was almost sure to be founded in whichever Manor was not the seat of the Mother Church. \u0153ijeatfjtlL This place figures in Domesday as Waltha (Waltham), a name so different from Wheathill in sound and signification, that we must ascribe the change to a mere error of the Clerk who wrote the fol lowing passage in the Survey. \u2014 \" The same Roger (de Laci) holds Waltha of the Earl.

Elmund, the Saxon Lord of Wheathill, had been also Lord of Morton (i. e. Morton Say in North Shropshire). This too was Roger de Lacy's at Domesday, and to complete the parallel, Morton and Wheathill were in after-times held under Lacy by the same Feoffee, viz. Say of Stokesay. I am not pro posing to give under Wheathill any successional account of Lacy, the Seignoral Lord, nor yet to detail all that I have collected as to his immediate Tenant, De Say. The Under-tenants of the latter, De Girros and Hacket, will form the prominent subject. However, it may be fitting to premise that the Says were enfeoffed in Wheathill by Lacy before the death of Henry I, that is, between 1086 and 1135, for the three knights' -fees which Helyas de Sai acknowledged himself in 1165 to be then holding of Hugh de Laci were of old feoffment.2 There were also two other fees which he denied holding under Laci ; that is, Laci could obtain no service from the same without legal process. These five fees afterwards re solved themselves into four, and of those four Wheathill was un questionably one. The earliest notice which I have of the Hakets, who became De Say's Tenants here, is very possibly of a date prior to their feoffment in Wheathill. In 1176 King Henry II, having held Pleas of the Forest at Worcester, had amerced Walter Haket 10 merks and Wdliam Haket 50 merks.3 In 1180 a Tenant in Wethale named Wuniet was charged 6c?. by the Justices ofthe Forest for an imbladement of one acre ; but the whole Vill of Hwethull, described as belonging to William de Girras, was amerced half a merk for waste.* This was that Willam de Girros, whose grant of half a hide in Leverdegrene to Wenlock Priory, was confirmed to wards the close of the twelfth Century by Hugh de Sai, as Seignoral Lord, in a Deed which I shall set forth more fully when I come to speak of that member of Wheathill anciently known as Leverdegrene. In November, 1194, 1 find Walter Hachet (then, I think, of Wheat hill) associated with other Jurors of Stottesden Hundred, in a Suit which I have mentioned under Chetton.5 Whether Oliver Haket (who in October 1199 was Recognizor in a Suit given under Castle Holgate) 6 was of Wheathill, I canuot say. 2 Liber Niger, I, 154. 3 Rot.

At the Assizes of October 1203 Walter Haket is twice named as Surety of certain Litigants, and on these accounts, or some other, stands ou the amercement-list as a debtor of one merk. On November 3, 1236, a Fine was levied between John le Poher, Plaintiff, and Juliana daughter of Walter Haket, Tenant, of a virgate in Whethull, whereof was assize of mort d'ancestre. The Plaintiff renouncing his claim, l'eceived 20s.7 About the year 1240 we have three Lists of the Shropshire Tenants of Walter de Lacy.

In Easter Term 1244, Amice widow of William Aurabu was suing Roger de Ledewys and John de Hunseslaw for her dower, viz. a third of two several virgates in Whethille.9 In Michaelmas Term 1249, a Grand Assize was pending between the Prior of Wenlock, Plaintiff, and Walter Haket, Tenant of 53 acres of wood in Stok (Stoke St. Milburg).10 In Michaelmas Term 1250, the stUl unawarded land is described as in Wodhull.11 In 1255 the Jurors of Stottesden Hundred returned Walter Ha ket as Lord of Whethull. \" He held it of Hugh de Say by service of one knight's-fee. It contained three hides of land, and did suit to the Hundred Courts. It also owed ward at Montgomery, for 40 days in war-time.

The service of Castle-Guard at Montgomery was common to several Manors, originaUy of Lacy's Fief. Patton, al ready noticed,13 is an instance of this. Walter Haket was himself on the Jury which made the above report. At the Assizes of Janu ary 1256 John de Brondon sued Walter Haket for disseizing him of a right of common-pasture in Egarton, which right pertained to the Tenement which the said John held under the said Walter in Brondon (now Bromden). Walter Haket pleaded that if there had been any disseizin it was by Margery his (Walter's) Mother, whose heir he was.

The Jury were satisfied as to the disseizin, but as to the fence, it had been erected by Haket's consent, and after a consideration paid to the said Haket by the Defendant.15 At the same Assizes, Avice Widow of William le Orfeure, sued John de Bromton (Bromden) for a third of a virgate in Whethul as her dower. The Defendant called Roger Constantyn to warranty, but Roger Constantyn did not appear on the right day.16 Afterwards, viz. on Feb. 5, Roger Constantyn ap peared, and called Walter Haket to warranty, but the result does not transpire, except that certain land of Roger Constantyn having been seized in manu Regis for his first default in warranty, is re stored to him on Feb. 14, under pledges.17 At these same Assizes Walter Haket was a Juror for Stottesden Hnndred. In August 1256 Walter Haket fines one merk to have an assize?8 apparently one of novel disseizin against William de Ledewic and others who had disseized Haket of a tenement in Wethul and common-pasture in La Clye (The Clee).19 In January 1257 Walter Haket occurs on a neighbouring Jury, and in December 1258 John de Brimidon occurs on another. At the Assizes of September 1272 Walter Haket was a Defaulter in attendance, and was reported as Tenant of a Knight's-fee, and yet not a Knight, though of full age. I should have supposed him to have been dead, and his son under age, for in November 1274 the Inquest on Stottesden Hundred found that Sir Robert de Torbervil had for four years previously been holding pleas as to the Assize of Beer in his Court of Wethul. He had also for the same period withdrawn the Suit of this Manor from Stottesden Hundred. The same Inquest reported how Hugh Don vil, a former Bailiff of the Hundred, had removed John de Brondon from some Jury for a bribe of 12c?. ; how John de la Watere, Con stable of Corfham, had extorted half a merk from Roger le Burger of Wethul, for taking a bundle of thorns from the woods of the Lord of Corfham, and a similar sum from Richard fitz Agnes of u Assizes, 40 Hen.

These TurberviUes were evidently Royalists of the Mortimer stamp. In 1284 the Lacy Seigneury here was in Theobald de Verdon one of Lacy's Coheirs ; the mediate interest of the Says was in Laurence de Ludlow, and Walter Haket was entered as the Lord of the Fee, holding the same by service of one knight's-fee under Ludlow, who held of Verdon, who held of the King in capite?2 The Stottesden Jurors, at the Assizes of October 1292, presented under the head De Valettis, that this Walter was of full age and Tenant of a whole knight's-fee, and yet not a Knight. On Sept. 22, 1300, Walter Haket had a grant of a weekly market on Thursday, and of an annual Fair on the eve and the day of Trinity Sunday, both at WhethuU, also a grant of Free-Warren in Eggarton (Salop) and Croide (Worcestershire).23 In 5 Edw.

At the Assizes of 1272 William Lardegrene was one of the non-attendants for Stot tesden Hundred. \u2014 The reason appears in the presentment of the Stottesden Jurors at the Assizes of 1292. They said that the Free Tenants and four men and the Provost of the Vills of Lorde grene and Hugeleye (Higley) used to come to the Sheriff' s-Tourn twice a year, till forty years since, when the Prior of Wenlock had withdrawn the said Suits to the Court of Wenlock. The Prior appeared to this charge, and said that he claimed nothing in Huggeleye, seeing that it was in tenure of Edmund de Mortimer, against whom the King had issued another writ on the very subject. As to Lordegrene, the Prior said that he had one Tenant there, and he pleaded Henry Ill's Charter as excusing the lands of St. Milburg from all Suits, etc. etc. The Jury found that neither Henry III nor Edward I had ever been seized of the Suit of Lor degrene ; so the Prior was quit.29 27 In possession of Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury.

We have already seen that in the time of Bishop William de Vere the Chapel of WTethull was treated as a mere Dependency of Stot tesden Church,32 obviously because the Saxon Parish of Stottesden involved this district. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Wethull in Stottesden Deanery at \u00a3_. per annum, adding that the Church is elsewhere beneficed.33 This remark is a mere mistake, an inversion of the real fact ; for Wethull paid a portion of 2s. to the Vicar of Stottesden, in composition doubtless of the old parochial subjection ; it also, like other Churches of Lacy's Shropshire Ba rony, paid a Portion (6s. 8d.) to the Prior of St. Guthlac's, at Here ford. In accordance with all this, the Inquisition of 1341 quotes the Church-Taxation of Wrethull as \u00a35. 8s. 8d., and proceeds to assess the Parish at 25s. only. \u2014 Four virgates of land lay fallow. Also the Foundation of the Church with lands and rents annexed (worth 8s.), certain tithes (worth 7s.), the small tithes, offerings, and other profits of the Church (worth \u00a32. 13s. 4d.) were aU exceptional to any estimate of the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb in the Parish.3* In 1534-5 the Preferment of Richard Coston, Rector of Whetall, was in tithes \u00a37. 6s. 6d., and the only charge thereon was 1 s. for Archdeacon's Synodals.35 30 Lord Forester's Register, fo. 40, b. 31 Monasticon, V, 81, b. 32 Supra, p. 153. 33 Pope Nich.

It was the only Manor in Condetret Hundred held by Osbern fitz Richard, Lord of Richard's Castle. He held it immediately of the King, and soon after Domes day it was annexed to Overs Hundred, in which Osbern fitz Richard had a predominant interest. Domesday notices the Manor thus : \u2014 \" The same Osbern holds Nene, and Siuuard (holds it) of him. The same Siuuard held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man. This Manor was never hidaged, nor ever paid geld. There is arable land (sufficient) for five ox-teams. In demesne is one team and ten Serfs, and a Mdl paying a bushel (modium) of corn. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 40s. per annum. Now it is worth 18s.\"1 Of Siward the Saxon I have spoken under Cleobury North.2 He held great estates in Shropshire in the reign of the Confessor, and some of them he held under the Church of Worcester. Neen is not one of the Manors named as having ever belonged to that Church, but the Church is said to have lost other Manors besides those enumerated by the Chronicler. The extraordinary immunities which Neen had enjoyed from remote times make it very possible that it had been Church-laud, and if so, held by Siward of the Church of Worcester. Siward seems eventually to have lost his Tenancy under the Barons of Richard's Castle, for Osbern fitz Hugh, grandson of Osbern fitz Richard, gave Nene, before 1185, to one who is called by my au thority the \" Childe Baldwine,\" his ordinary name being, I suppose, Baldwin le Poer. Baldwin le Poer being dead, and leaving oidy daughters, and Hugh de Say, nephew of Osbern fitz Hugh, being Lord of Richard's-Castle, the latter gave a seignoral right over the Coheiresses to one Roger de Solariis, who thus became Mesne Lord of Neen.

The first was married to * * de Fraxino, the two others to relations of Roger de Solariis. Thus there came to be three famdies named De Solariis which had an interest in Neen, a circumstance which makes their distinct history a matter of no little difficulty. I will first speak of Roger de Solariis, the Mesne Lord, and his descent. He appears to me to have been of Dorston, in Herefordshire, a Manor held by service of one Knight's-Fee under the Barons Clifford, who were closely connected with the Barons of Richard's Castle. The suc cessor, probably the son of Roger de Solariis, was named WUliam, and he it was who in a Feodary of about the year 1230, is said to hold a Knight's-fee in Nene under the Lords of Richard's Castle.4 This William, or his son of the same name, appears in January, 1243, as holding Dorsinton (Dorston) under the third Walter de Clifford.5 Again William de Solariis occurs in 1255, as Mesne Lord of Neen Sollers, and in 1272, he occupies a similar position, being called to warranty by some of the Coparceners who held under him, and being distinguished from one of those Coparceners as \" William de Sollers de Dorsington.\" Eustachia le Poer, the eldest daughter, as I believe, of Bald win le Poer, married * * * * de Solariis, and had by him a son John de Solariis, or else her husband himself was John de Solariis. The former is the statement on Record,6 the latter much more pro bable on chronological grounds. Eustachia's husband, whatever his name, seems to have enfeoffed a Tenant in his share of Neen, viz. one Jordan de Alneto. Hence a Feodary of about the year 1210, gives Jordan de Alneto, Ranulf de Solers, and Engeram de Fraxino, as each holding one-fourth of a Knight's-fee in the Honor of Ri chard's Castle.7 I do not suppose that the exact Tenure of each is here stated correctly, and the Mesne tenure of Roger de Solers Liber Ruber Scaccarii, so. cxlv.

These three Coparceners were living in November 1221, when, as I have elsewhere said, Jordan de Alneto, having a lawsuit against John de Brompton, named Engeram de Fraxino, and Ranulf de Solariis, his Attorneys.8 The Tenant of this share of Neen Sollars, in 1240, was Walter de Esse, of whom I shall say more under Nash. He and his Partners are set down as holding a Knight's Fee in None Baudewin, under the Barons of Richard's Castle, all Mesne interests being again omitted.9 In Easter Term 1250, Richard de Harleg sued William de Esse for two-thirds of a messuage and carucate of land in Ene (read Nene). William de Esse called his Seigneur, WUliam de Solariis (son of John de Solariis), to warranty. William de Solariis vouched the warranty, and pleaded that he was only a Coparcener, for that Baldwin le Poer had had three daughters, whose descendants he proceeded to specify. \u2014 Eustachia, one of the said daughters, had issue John de Solariis, and the said John had issue WiUiam de Solariis, the present Defendant. It was proved that one of the other Coparceners was a Minor, so the case was adjourned tiU he should come of age.10 The share thus held by-William de Esse under Wdliam de Solariis, fell within the next five years to WiUiam de Clifford, as Tenant. The latter sat as a Juror on the Inquisition of Overs Hundred in 1255, and the finding as to Nene Bauwyn was as follows : \u2014 WUliam de Clifford, Hugh de Fraxino, and Philip de Mungumery (Custos of the heir of William fitz Randulph) , hold one Knight's-fee of Wdliam de Solers11 in the Vill of Nene, of the Barony of Burford, and they do no other Suit than to the two Towns of the Sheriff annually.12 In 1256, I find that Walter de Clifford and William de Solariis were at issue about some market improperly established,13 but by which of the parties or where does not appear ; but it is probable that the William de Solariis concerned was he who then held a share of Neen over William de Clifford, and under William de Solariis, of Dorston.

At the Assizes of 1272, Roger de Solers (one of the other Co parceners of Neen) claimed 4s. rent in Neen as heir of Juliana de Pernell, his deceased Aunt. He sued William de Clifford for ls. 8d. of the said rent, and Agnes, Widow of Adam de la Re, for 2s. 4rf. Agnes caded Wdliam de Solers to warranty. He seems to have vouched a warranty in both cases, for it is added that he called Wilham de Solers, of Dorsinton, to warranty of the whole.15 In this same year, John le King, of Ayston, with Alice his wife, take out a writ of novel disseizin against William de Clifford and Walter Partrik, concerning a Tenement in Solers Neyn.16 At the Inquisi tion of Overs Hundred (November 1274) each of the three Feoffees of Neen were on the Jury, viz. William de Clifford, Hugh de Frene, and Roger de Solars.17 They also occur on a local Jury in August 1278, and the Feodary of 1284 gives them as holding Neen Solers by one knight's-fee under Edmund de Mortimer, who held under Robert de Mortimer.18 This statement brings to light a change in the Seigneury of Neen Sollars, which had taken place at some pre vious period. Edmund de Mortimer, of Wigmore, held the whole Manor under Robert de Mortimer of Richard's Castle, but how he acquired this tenure I cannot say. Nor yet can I say whether Sollers of Dorston held under Edmund de Mortimer and over the Coparceners, or whether it was Solers' intermediate interest which Edmund de Mortimer had acquired. Lastly, it is doubtful whether some Tenant holding next over William de Clifford is not omitted in the above statement. The Inquisition on the death of Robert de Mortimer, taken August 13, 1287, says that Edmund de Mortimer was Tenant of the deceased, both of the Manor and Advowson of Nene Solers. He held by service of one Knight's-fee. The Manor was worth \u00a316. per annum ; the Church was worth 20 merks.19 So again the Inquest of February 1305, on the death of Edmund de Mortimer of Wigmore, states him to have had the Advowson of Neen Solers, and that the Coparceners (Parcenarii) held the Manor under the deceased by one knight's-fee.20 And again in April 1308, 16 Assizes, 56 Hen.

Her son (or, as I think, her husband) Ingeram de Fraxino, occurs under the dates of 1203, 1210 and 1221. Ingeram's successor was Hugh de Fraxino, the same, I imagine, as he who, in 1243, held two hides in Sutton St. Nicholas (afterwards caUed Sutton Frene) and Marden, both mem bers of the Honour of Kington, and situated in Herefordshire. These he held by half a knight's-fee.22 He also held half a knight's-fee in Moccas, of the Earl of Hereford, and of the same honour of King ton.23 Like WiUiam de Esse, his Coparcener in Neen, this Hugh de Femes, as he is written, was sued by Richard de Harlegh in Easter Term 1250, for one carucate, less five acres, in Nene. Like Wil- Uam de Esse, he pleaded his tenure in Coparcenery, and showed that Richard, son of WUliam de Solers, the third Coparcener, and a necessary party to the Suit, was under age.24 Hugh de Nene, a Juror for Overs Hundred, at the Assizes of January 1256, may have been identical with Hugh de Fraxino, and WUliam de Frene, another Juror, may have been his relation and Undertenant. On January 18, 1266, King Henry III grants, inter alia, to Matilda, wife of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, the lands which were Hugh de Fraxino's in Nene and Gurlokesho, the said Hugh having been an adherent of Simon de Montfort.25 This Hugh de Fraxino occurs as interested in Neen under the further dates of 1255, 1272, 1274, and 1284. The particulars have been already given, or shall be included in what I have to say of the third Coparcener in this Manor. \u2014 Elena le Poer, presumed to have been youngest daughter of the \" Childe Baldwin,\" married * * * de Solariis. Her son, or hus band, Ranulph de Solariis has occurred above under dates of 1210 and 1221. The son and heir of Ranulph de Solariis was named Wdliam. He was caUed William fitz Ranulph, to distinguish him, I presume, from two cotemporaries of his name. He was dead in 1250 and his son Richard, then a Minor, was the third Coparcener 21 Inquisitions, 1 Edw.

It is probable that Richard fitz WiUiam died in infancy, or at all events without issue. Roger de Solariis, his heir, I take to have been his younger brother. In 1272, John de Arundel prosecuted Hugh de Frene and Roger de Sollers for disseizing him of common-pasture in three carucates in Sollers Nene, a right said to appertain to John's tenement in Tateneshul and Merebroch. The Defendants appeared not, and a verdict was recorded against them.26 They appealed against this, and sued out a Writ for twenty-four Jurors to be empanelled, who should convict the former twelve of a false verdict. The second trial was caUed on, but again they appeared not. The Judges ordered them to be committed to prison. Afterwards they accorded with John de Arundel, he renouncing his claim.27 This Roger de Solariis further occurs as a Juror for Overs Hundred in 1272, and in 1274, 1278, and 1284, according to the particulars already given. THE CHURCH. This Church does not occur to my notice tdl the year 1287, when Mortimer of Wigmore had obtained the Advowson from Mortimer of Richard's Castle. It was then valued at 20 merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8d.) per annum?8 The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Nenesolers in the Deanery of Burford as worth \u00a38. per annum, besides a por tion of 3s. which the Abbot of Wigmore had therein.29 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the Church-Taxation oi Niensolersas v\u00a38. 3s., but rated the Parish at \u00a35. to the current Levy. Three carucates of land there lay fallow, the Tenants being impoverished. Also the Glebe, small-tithes, the offerings, and some other spiritual dues worth 60s. per annum, were not included in the Taxation of the Church.30 The Valor of 1534-5 speaks of Nyende Solas and Mil ston as constituting one Rectory. This combination probably was as old as Domesday when Milson, though not in Condetret Hundred, was yet accounted a Berewick of Neen. The preferment of Rich ard Lucy, Incumbent of this Rectory in 1534-5, was in Glebe and 26 \u25a0 27 Assizes, 56 Hen. Ill, 4 dorso, 13 given why the Assessment varies from the Church-Taxation.

The reasou why it is identical in name, and for the most part in extent, with the Domesday Hundred, is that the Lords of Richard's- Castle had the chief manorial in terest here as w ell as the Soke or Hundredal Seigneury. The changes of boundary which have been made are so perfectly intelligible in themselves that in following the history of this Hundred we learn the theory which guided the preservation of ancient boundaries or, if circumstances suggested it, annihilated them. When the Shrop shire Hundreds were generally rearranged, in the time of Henry I, Overs lost nothing except Earls Ditton, which Domesday had already recognised as a member of Cleobury Mortimer. It therefore went to the Hundred (Stottesden), in which Cleobury Mortimer was then placed. At the same time, Neen Sollars was annexed to Overs, in which Hundred, Milson, a Berewick of Neen SoUars, was placed at Domesday. The reason of this increase to Overs Hundred was because the Lord of Richard's Castle was Manorial Lord of Neen Sollars. When after the battle of Evesham, Roger de Mortimer and the Abbot of Wigmore obtained Charters which exempted several of their Manors from aU subjection to Hundred-Courts, Cainham and Coreley were severed from Overs Hundred; but when these franchises of Mortimer and Wigmore Abbey were destroyed, Cain ham and Corley were not restored to Overs Hundred, but annexed to Stottesden, to which many of Mortimer's not yet independent Manors had before the battle of Evesham belonged. This annexation to Stottesden Hundred was probably a mistake, \u2014 the result of a false association. To this day however the error stands, and we see Overs Hundred severed in twain by a long strip of land, \u2014 an offshoot as it were of Stottesden Hundred. Other changes of Overs Hundred have been as follows : \u2014 Lower Ledwich was detached therefrom by the special Franchises of the Prior of Bromfield, but at what period I cannot say. Now like Bromfield itself, in which Parish it anciently stood, Lower Ledwich is annexed to Munslow Hundred."], [771, "OVRES HUNDRED. 299 Secondly, in the thirteenth century we find Henley in a state of separation from Overs Hundred by reason of its temporary con nection with Ludlow Castle. Now that part of Henley which is in Bitterley Parish has been restored to its original Hundred of Overs, but another part which is in Stanton-Lacy Parish is, I presume, re puted to be in the Hundred of Munslow. Thus much I have said as to the changed boundaries of this Domesday Hundred, and now it will be fitting to state something as to the progressive alterations in the Soke or Jurisdiction. \u2014 The Lord of the Hundred at the time of the Conquest was the Lord of Burford and Richard's Castle. This was Richard fitz Scrobi, a Norman who had been settled in England many years before the Conquest, and was a favourite of Edward the Confessor. This Richard fitz Scrobi being one of the few Normans who had not in curred the hatred of the Saxons, was allowed to remain in England in 1052, when the party of Earl Godwin procured the expulsion of the majority of such Settlers.1 He survived the Conquest, and these facts confirm the truth of the assertion, made two centuries afterwards,2 that he was Lord of Overs Hundred at the time of that event. After his time his Successors, finding that \" they could not distribute justice nor punish the folk\" of the district, gave half of the Hundred to the King, on condition of receiving aid in such matters.3 This joint jurisdiction existed in the year 1255. The Hundred then was nominally paying 16s. per annum for the enjoy ment of its usages. Half of this sum went to the Crown and half to the Lord of Burford. The Sheriff, I presume, accounted 8s. in the ferm of the County for this item of Royal revenue, but the actual sum which he received from his Bailiff of Overs was 100s.4 The difference was of course realized by all kinds of extortion ex ercised by the subordinate officer. The Hundred was represented at the Assizes of 1203, 1221, and also at the Assizes of 1256, by twelve Jurors and a Bailiff,\u2014 Adam Wele in 1256. They made the usual presentments, and said that the Hundred was worth 100s. per annum, a statement which, compared with the former account, is intelligible, but hardly full enough. The Inquisition of 1274 gave a very different account of the value of this Hundred. At the time of the battle of Evesham it seems to have been worth 10^ punishment stands for punishment general. 1 Florence of Worcester, I, 210. II, 1. 2 Rot. Hundred. II, 74. 4 Rot. Hundred.

These were prescrip tive adjuncts of his Jurisdiction as Lord of the Hundred. The Jurors remembered how John Bard, Under Sheriff to Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh, had exacted 4 merks from Hugh de Mor timer of Burford, because the latter ejected the said Under Sheriff from the Liberty of Burford, and would not aUow him to hold In quisitions there, which indeed he had no right to hold. This, I presume, was a question which regarded the Manor of Burford only, but I mention it here because it exhibits one Lord of the Hundred upholding his manorial rights at the expense of his Domesday Name.

BARONY OE BURFORD AND RICHARD'S CASTLE. Richard Scrob, otherwise called Richard Fitz-Scrob, was one of the Norman Favourites of King Edward the Confessor, one of those too who escaped the rancour of Earl Godwin and his Sons in 1052, and were not forced to leave the kingdom with others of their fellow-countrymen. This was not alone due to the King's partiality, but, as we are told, to the blameless conduct of the favoured few towards the native Saxons. Robert the Deacon, a Norman, whose daughter Richard Scr\u00bbb had married, was another who remained.2 We gather from Domesday an account of Richard Scrob's possessions in the time of King Edward. He had four Manors in Worcestershire and one in Shropshire (Burford). He had also an interest in Herefordshire, where he is alluded to as Richard Scrupe,8 but the Herefordshire Domesday refers to a period of the Confessor's reign when Osbern fitz Richard was already seized of sixteen Manors in that County.4 I conclude that his Father had given them up to him. Richard Scrupe survived the Conquest, and obviously threw his weight into the scale of the Normans. In the year 1067 we find him associated with the CasteUans of Herefordshire, and not very successfully resisting Domesday, so. 260, a, 1. have more to say under Bromfield. 2 Florence Wigorn.

Edric the Forester, who still continued to maintain the Saxon cause in the West.5 Richard Scrupe is said to have built Richard's Castle in Herefordshire, and its name to have been derived from him as its Founder. This trenches on a very curious but difficult question. The Herefordshire Domesday identifies no such Castle, but under the land of Osbern fitz Richard it mentions a Castle called Auretone in Cutestornes Hundred, which was worth 20s. per annum to Osbern fitz Richard, and wherein he had twenty-three men who paid him half the said income.6 Another page of the same Record speaks of a Manor of _\\ hides in the Chatellany (castellarid) of Auretoue as having been held in the days of the Confessor by one Richarrd.7 This Richard I doubt not to have been Richard Scrupe, and Auretone to have been the Castle after wards called Richard's Castle, but why the Castle came to his son Osbern without the estate I cannot imagine. I shall have more to say on this subject hereafter. Richard Scrupe was deceased before Domesday, and his son \u2014 Osbern fitz Richard was seized of numerous Manors, held under the King or the Earl of Shrewsbury, and in the Counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, \"Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Bed fordshire. Of all these, his Father had held five in the Confessor's reign, while Osbern himself had held two in Worcestershire, sixteen in Herefordshire, and two in Shropshire at the same early period. The remainder had been acquired since the Conquest. From Osbern fitz Richard I pass to his son \u2014 Hugh fitz Osbern, living in the time of Henry I, but of whom very little seems to be known. As \" Hugh son of Osbern son of Richard,\" he stands first witness to a very remarkable grant made by Osbern fitz Pontius to the Abbey of Pershore. He is followed by Turstin his Brother and Baldric his knight in this attestation.8 The wife of Hugh fitz Osbern was Eustachia de Say, whom most accounts would induce us to associate with the Says of Shropshire, i. e. the Barons of Clun or the Lords of Stokesay. Either sup position is, as far as I know, without foundation. Nevertheless Eustachia de Say must have been a person of importance, for she 5 Florence Wigorn. II, 1.

She aud her son, Osbern fitz Hugh, may justly be esteemed as Founders of the Nunnery of Westwood in Worcester shire. Their grants in Westwood and elsewhere to the Anjovin monastery of Fontevrauld resulted in a Convent of Nuns being placed at Westwood under the sanction of Henry II. The King's License or Confirmation bears date at Worcester, and must have passed within the first four years of his reign.9 Osbern fitz Hugh, of whom I am now to speak, had succeeded his Father before the year 1140, \u2014 for that was undoubtedly the date of Stephen's Patent, giving the Earldom of Hereford to Robert Earl of Leicester. The King does not give the new Earl any Seigneury over the Fief of Osbern fitz Hugh, but excepts it from his grant.10 It appears from good but unvouched authority that the wife of Osbern fitz Hugh was Amicia, daughter of Walter de Clifford.11 We may estimate the probability of this match by what we shall hear of the friendly relations of the two families. I find Walter de Clifford and Osbern fitz Hugh attesting a grant of Roger Earl of Hereford to Brecknock Priory, which cannot have passed later or earlier than 1155.1- In the year 1161 there was a Scutage or Aid levied in Hereford shire, but not in Shropshire. The object of this levy is not re corded. Osbern fitz Hugh was originally charged \u00a320. for fifteen Knights' -fees, that is, 2 merks per fee, but the King excused by Writ the sum of J4.'6s. 8d., \u2014 that being apparently the proportion assessed upon his Knights in Shropshire.13 In 1165-6 Osbern fitz Hugh made a return of the Knights'-fees composing his Barony, \u2014 an invaluable Document were it in existence. The reason of its loss I have before explained.14 In 1167 Osbern fitz Hugh was amerced ten merks by Alan de Nevdl, Justice of the Forest ; but the King excused the whole penalty.15 In 1168 he was charged twenty-three merks to the Aid on marriage of the King's daughter : that is his Barony was assumed to consist of 23 Knights'-fees. of the Says is far the most correct of any I have seen ; the one which I annex to this account is corrective of a very few errors, and supplies some important dates. 9 Monasticon, VII, 1004, No. i.

The latest occur rence of Osbern fitz Hugh is his confirmation of an act of Baldwin Bishop of Worcester, and therefore after August 1180, the date of that Prelate's consecration. He is, in this instance, called Osbern de Say, and is accompanied by his brother Hugh. In 1185 he was deceased without issue, and his said Brother, being his heir, fined 200 merks for livery of his lands.17 Before I proceed with Hugh de Say I should say something of the eleemosynary and other deeds of Osbern fitz Hugh, besides his share in the foundation of West wood. He was Lord of Tenbury in Worcestershire, a Manor where Walter de Clifford was his Tenant. Walter de Clifford was Lord of the neighbouring Manor of Rocheford in Herefordshire. The Chapel of Rocheford was an affiliation of the Church of Tenbury. Hence we find Osbern fitz Hugh quitting his claim to that Church in favour of the Norman Abbey of Lira, and Walter de Clifford coincidently quitting all claim both to Tenbury Church and Roche ford Chapel in favour of the same Religious House.18 Osbern fitz Hugh's grant to the Nunnery of Godstow is a document of pe culiar interest, and very consistent with the idea that his wife was a Sister of Rosamund Clifford. He gives a salt-pit in Wich called Vacca, which pertained to his Manor of Wichbold, to the Nuns, at request of Sir Walter de Clifford, and for the soul's health of Margaret de Clifford, Walter's wife, and of Rosamund, Walter's daughter, whose bodies were resting at Godstow. This grant was made with the assent of King Henry II and of Hugh the Grantor's Brother, and was attested by Walter de Clifford, Richard his son, Lucia his daughter (she was wife of Hugh de Say), and Wdliam de Heton.19 An apparently cotemporary grant by Walter de Clif ford himself to the same Nunnery has the attestations of Osbern fitz Hugh and Hugh de Say.19 Osbern fitz Hugh was also a Benefactor to Haughmond Abbey. 16 Rot.

Hugh de Say attested the Deed, and ap parently after his Brother's death confirmed it, receiving from the lady \" a golden ring with a turquois in the Hall of Bureford.\"23 Hugh de Say, brother and heir of Osbern fitz Hugh, fined 200 merks, as I have said, in 1185 for his livery. He seems to have come into notice earlier, if it were indeed he who in 1176, was amerced 20 merks for Forest-trespass in Dorsetshire or Somersetshire.24 Of his fine for livery he continued to pay instalments till the year 1190, when a balance of \u00a323. 3s. 4d. stood against him ; but in that year he died ; for a Fine of \u00a3100. by Hugh de Say, then recorded,25 indi cates the succession of Hugh de Say (II), his son and heir. Of him I shall speak presently. Hugh de Say, the father, was undoubtedly the husband of Lucia de Clifford, and I suppose it was with this Lady that he acquired a feoffment of the Manor of Rocheford, al ready spoken of. Hence in the Haughmond Chartulary we find a Deed whereby, \u2014 \" Hugh de Say, and Lucia his wife, daughter of Walter de Clifford, son of Richard fitz Poncius, gave to that Abbey the Mill of Rocheforde with suit, etc. thereof. \u2014 Witnesses : Walter de Clifford Junior, Richard de Clifford his Brother.\" The first witness, callino- himself \" Walter de Clifford, son of Walter, son of Richard fitz Poncius, confirmed this grant, calling Hugh de Say's wife his (Walter's) Sister. \u2014 Witnesses : Hugh de Say and Richard de Clif- 20 . 21 . 22 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

The ex planation is that Clifford held the much more important Manor of Tenbury under Hugh de Say. Hugh de Say (I) died, as I have said, in 1190. He left his wife Lucia surviving and two sons Hugh and Richard. Richard (apparently from a misconstruction of the Haughmond Chartulary) has been supposed to have been the elder of these two Brothers, and to have died without issue. The latter idea is, I presume, only a corollary of the former, but the former being false, the latter does not follow. The facts are these. \u2014 \" Lucia de Say, daughter of Walter de Clifford, with consent of her son (evidently her eldest son) Hugh de Say, gave to Haugh mond Abbey, three virgates and some lesser parcels of land in the vill of Rocheforde, the Canons returning to her that Cup of Gold which Osbern fitz Hugh had given them. \u2014 Witnesses : Hugh de Say (her son I presume) and Walter de Clifford (her Brother pro bably).\" Also \" Richard son of Hugh de Say,\" having I suppose a younger son's portion in Rocheford, \" confirms his Father's and Mother's joint grant of Rocheford Mill, as well as the grant of three virgates, etc., which his Mother, after his Father's death had given to the same Abbey. \u2014 Witnesses : Walter de Clifford, Gilbert de Say, Ro bert Wyard, John his son.\" But Lucia de Say seems to have remarried to Bartholomew de Mortimer ; for calling herself daughter of Walter de Clifford, and alleging the consent of the said Mortimer her husband, she \" releases certain claims to Haughmond Abbey in Rocheford, and also certain land about which she and the Abbey had lately had contention. \u2014 Witnesses: William Carbonel, Robert Wiarde.\"27 Hugh de Say (II) had fined \u00a3100. for Livery before Michaelmas 1190.

At Michaelmas 1195 Hugh de Say pays a further instal ment of \u00a36. 13s. 4d., but taking advantage of the identity of his own and his Father's names, he pays the said instalment as a part of the lesser balance left due by his Father. The next year no instal ment on either balance was paid, for a reason which will presently appear. Hugh de Say (II) seems immediately on his succession to have been employed in the Wars of Wales. At Michaelmas 1191 I find that the Sheriff of Shropshire had paid him 25 merks for ward of the 'Castle of Norton (in Radnorshire) and \u00a36. 8s. for 40 swine wherewith to victual the said Castle. This was by the King's order expressed through the Chancellor (Longchamp). In 1194 he was with King Richard in Normandy, and for that reason the King excuses him a sum of \u00a323. which had been charged on the 23 Fees of his Barony for the Scutage which had purchased the King's Redemption. In 1195 he was again in Wales, for the Sheriff of Herefordshire pays him 100s. by order of Archbishop Hubert towards fortifying the Castle of Blidewach. Before Michaelmas 1196 I should infer from the Pipe-Rolls that he was dead. His debts above mentioned were undiminished. He also owed \u00a323. for the Scutage of Normandy assessed in 1195, and \u00a323. for the second Scutage of Normandy assessed in 1196. All the arrears which thus stood against this Barony were repeated without any attempt at liquidation on the Pipe-Roll of 1197. These Details have some thing of an interpretation in other Records. It is not quite clear whether the Welsh Chronicle intends to fix the battle of Radnor in 1195 or 1196. If it was shortly before Archbishop Hubert's Welsh campaign (and the Chronicle implies as much), then it was shortly before August 1196. In that battle Hugh de Say was associated with Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, and both were defeated.28 The Chronicle does not inform us that Hugh de Say was killed, but I learn from other authority that he fell in the wars of Wales,29 and I doubt not that it was at or soon after the battle of Radnor. The wife of this Hugh de Say was Mabel daughter of Robert Marmion. She survived her husband, and had the whole of Cotheridge and more than \u00a311. per annum in Wichbold for her dower, as awarded by a judicial decision in Michaelmas Term 1199.30 a Suit of dower against Hugh de Ferrars, claiming lands in Shropshire and Worces shire.

Hugh de Ferrars became the next Baron of Richard's Castle by marrying Margaret, sole daughter and heir31 of Hugh de Say. This marriage he obtained in 1197 by a fine of 300 merks, whereof 100 seem to have been paid down at once to Archbishop Hubert. His Sureties for the whole were Geoffrey de Say, and Walcheline de Ferrars.33 The latter we know to have been Father of Hugh, and Lord of Okeham, in Rutlandshire. At the date of this Fine, and probably for many years later, Margaret de Say was under age. She was certainly so in Easter Term 1200, when a cause in which she was caded to warranty was adjourned till she should be of age. In the same Term, Hugh de Ferrars appears as if seized of the Barony ; for there was a suit about land and warranty in which he and Richard de Say (Margaret's Uncle, I presume) were concerned.33 Hugh de Ferrars' Fine seems to have been afterwards considerably increased ; at all events his debts to the Crown in 1201, in con- nection with this Barony, stood at .\u20ac236. 17s.,3* or more than 350 merks, though some instalments had been paid to reduce it to that balance. In the current year he paid or pleaded further reductions, which left the balance against him \u00a3153. 3s. 8d. The second scu- tage of King John was levied in this year, and Hugh de Ferrars had acquittance in the several Counties of Warwickshire, Hereford- shire, Worcestershire, and Berkshire.35 In Shropshire he was not put in charge at aU. The same may be said of the third and fourth Scutages of John's reign, but for the fifth Scutage, assessed in 1204, Hugh de Ferrars had a special exemption addressed to the Sheriff of Shropshire.36 In this year Hugh de Ferrars died, without issue by his infant wife Margaret. His own inheritance, which he had enjoyed for a season in succession to his elder Brother Henry, was now claimed by his Sister Isabella, whom I have already noticed as wife of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. Meanwhile, two Writs- Close, dated August 15 and 25, 1204, order the Sheriffs of Shrop- 31 Nash's Pedigree gives to Hugh de Say (II) two Sons, Hehas and Robert, represented to have died s. p. This is an error, arising from a misconstruction of the Haughmond Chartulary. ' The two individuals, Helias and Robert, were pos sibly Sons of a Hugh de Say, but I shall speak of them elsewhere as members of a different family, viz. Say of Stokesay. The latter case probably concerned land in Rocheford. The name of Hugh de Say is inserted in the entry as if a party to the Suit. This could not have been actually the case, and the error must be ascribed to the Law-Clerk. Probably Hugh de Say was mentioned as then represented by Hugh de Ferrars. 34 Rot.

Cantilupe was to hold them during the King's pleasure.37 Margaret de Say still remained a child though a Widow. In October 1204, I find the first mention of Thomas de Galwey, afterwards Earl of Athol, as in the service and pay of King John. In March 1205, it appears that this Thomas de Galwey had fur nished certain Ships manned with mercenaries, for the King's ser vice, to whom the King promises one half of the goods which they should gain from the King's foes, besides their full and proper pay.3S Other marks of the King's consideration for Thomas de Galwey occur in the same year, and on November 8 he informs the Sheriffs of Shropshire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, that he has given the wife of Hugh de Ferrars to Thomas de Galwey, who is imme diately to have seizin of all lands which the said Hugh held in right of his said wife, but not of any other lands held by Hugh.39 Thomas de Galwey does not seem to have actually married the great Heiress, but the matter was a long time pending. On June 30th, 1207, Thomas de Galwey appears to lie under some temporary suspicion, for his Bailiffs are ordered to render up to William de Cantilupe three Castles, and all other things belonging thereto, which he held by the King's pleasure, viz. Richard's Castle, Stapleton Castle, and Hamm Castle.40 But on August 18 following, the Constable of Chester having apparently offered himself as a Guarantee for Tho mas de Galwey, the King orders William de Cantilupe to give the land and stock of Thomas de Galwey, described as lying in Here fordshire, to the said Constable, but to keep certain Castles till the Constable shall have sent his Steward to do fealty to the King for their safe custody.41 Thomas de Galwey seems to have recovered his position by a Fine of 1000 merks, proffered about September 1207, \"that he might have the land of Hugh de Say.\" He was to pay 30 merks at the present Term of Michaelmas, 30 merks at Easter following, and at a higher rate annually afterwards, when he should have had to wife the daughter and heir of the said Hugh de Say. William de Cantilupe was ordered to give the proper seizin after taking security for the Fine.42 This provisional arrangement probably existed up to May 14, 1208, at which time the Fine and V Rot.

Close- Rolls, which would have indicated any change, are broken off. The Patent and Charter Rolls are further preserved down to May 6, 1209, and they indicate no interruption of the King's under standing with Thomas de Galwey. Between that time and June 1211, though we have no Record asserting the fact, we may con clude that \u2014 Robert de Mortimer fined for and obtained the marriage of Margery de Say, and became Baron of Richard's Castle. Coinci dently we know that Thomas de Galwey came into great disgrace, and it was not till August 1212, that the King, at request of Wil liam King of Scots, remitted the anger which he had conceived against Thomas de Galwey, Earl of Athol, for a raid (raptu) at York.43 Of the antecedents of Robert de Mortimer, thus advanced, it is difficult to say anything with certainty, because he had a Cotem porary, Robert de Mortimer of Attilberg, from whom we cannot always distinguish him.44 When Dugdale suggested that he was either son or Brother of the first Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore, the great Antiquary was assigning a wrong date to evidence which, thus interpreted, would place Robert de Mortimer's \u00e6ra at least forty-two years earlier than his marriage with the heiress of Ri chard's Castle. There is no proof nor any reasonable probability that he was nearly related to the Mortimers of Wigmore. Calling him Robert de Mortimer of Essex for the present, I will merely state my impression that he was more nearly connected with the House of Attilberg than that of Wigmore.45 On Dec. 1, 1205, King John gives to Robert de Mortimer eight librates of escheated lands in Essex,46 and on May 1, 1206, the King fixes the grant to be in Estham.47 In June, 1211, owing to his marriage with Margery de Say, Ro bert de Mortimer is entered as a Tenant in capite of Shropshire by 43 Patent, p. 93.

About July 1213 Robert de Mortimer proffers \" to serve the King for a year with nine other Knights, and at his own cost, if he may be quit of the debt which he owes the King for his Fine for having his wife.\"53 On August 31, 1213, he was one of the Commissioners appointed for Herefordshire to inquire as to the injuries done to the Church in the late period of discord.53 On November 7, 1213, the King had evidently accepted his proffered services, for he excuses him his debt or debts of 500 merks, in consideration of his recent Fine.54 Accordingly, from his attestation of Royal Writs only, we learn that in 1214 he was with King John in Poitou. Besides this, a Writ dated at St. Maixent on August 23, 1214, orders him to have resti- tution of land taken from him in Herefordshire ;55 another Writ, dated at Parteuay on Sept. 2, ensures his enjoyment of such fran- chises as his predecessors had enjoyed in those Counties where his lands lay.56 He seems to have had some difficulty in obtaining his Wife's estates, for on July 30, 1215, Margery de Say, in presence of the King at Brug, names Robert de Mortimer her husband as her Attorney to sue Gilbert de Say and all others, against whom she wished to proceed in obtaining her inheritance.57 On December 3, 1215, Robert de Mortimer has restitution of the land of Berewic in Sussex which, having been the property of Mabel de Say, mother of Mortimer's wife, was now in the hand of Robert Marmion Senior.58 On February 25, 1216, the Sheriff of Leicestershire (read Lincoln shire) is ordered to give ten librates of land in Herlaveston to 48 . 49 . so Testa de Nevil! , pp. 55, 43, 44, 69.

The accession of Henry III was no disad vantage to those who had faithfully adhered to his Father. Among other marks of favour, I notice particularly Letters- Close of October 1217, which enabled Robert de Mortimer to receive his own scutage in Essex.63 The latest that I hear of Robert de Mortimer, as living, is under date of January 26, 1219, when the King puts him on a commission to deliver certain Castles of the Welsh Border to Hu bert de Burg.64 On July 3, 1219, Robert de Mortimer was dead, for the King, being at Hereford, orders the Sheriff of Essex to assign to Margery de Say his widow, dower in such lands in Essex as were of the inheritance of her late husband.65 On July 5, 1219, the King took the homage of Margaret de Say at Gloucester, and ordered the Sheriffs of Herefordshire, Northamptonshire, Worces tershire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire, Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire to give her seizin of Richard's Castle and all other lands of her inheritance. She was also to have all arrears of scutages which her Tenants should have paid, in the first instance, to Hugh de Ferrars, her former husband, and which the King had since ordered to be paid to Robert de Mortimer in his time.66 The King's Letter to this Lady in anticipation of her third marriage is unusu ally deferential, but indicates a mourning of only four months. It runs thus :\u2014 \" The King to Margery, formerly wife of Robert de Mortimer, greeting. \u2014 Know that it is well pleasing to us if at the same time it be a matter of complacence to you, that you take our faithful and beloved William de Stutevill for your husband, and to this we give our assent.

Of \u2014 William de Stutevill, who thus became Lord of Richard's Castle, I know nothing previous to his advancement,09 unless it were he whom a Writ of King John's, in July 1216, mentions with some appearance of distrust.70 At the Assizes of 1221 the Jurors of Overs Hundred presented Margery de Say's previous marriage to Stutevill as by the King's act. Her lands in this Hundred they valued at \u00a310. per annum. In August 1223 William de Stutevill was serving the King in the Army of Wales. He was therefore permitted to gather his own Scutage from his Knights in Here fordshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Berkshire, as also to levy an Aid on his free tenants in some of those Counties towards his own support in the King's service.71 In 1224 he had quittance of the Scutage of Bedford. In February 1226 he is in attendance on the King at Windsor,73 and in May 1227 has custody of Kenil worth Castle for the Crown.73 In 1229 he was charged 10 merks for the Scutage of Keri, in respect of the five reputed fees of his Shropshire Barony,74 but in 1230 was excused the Scutage of Brit tany.75 In 1231 the Scutage of Poitou, assessed at 3 merks per Fee, was charged on his Shropshire Barony ; \u2014 viz. at \u00a310. on 5 fees.76 In 1232 he was acquitted of the Scutage of Elveyn.77 In some instances the Barony of Burford is not noticed on the Scutage Rolls of Shropshire, it being assessed in gross under some other County. When distinguished from other Counties, it is usually re puted to have been five knights'-fees. In 1235-6, when the Aid on marriage of the King's Sister was collected in Shropshire, William de Stutevill paid one instalment, as if his Barony consisted of 4| fees, the other as if of 4i fees. Robert Busun, Seneschal of Rich ard's Castle, went to Brug with the money.78 About four years later, and we find the Shropshire part of this Barony estimated in one instance to contain 5f fees, in another only 3f fees.79 The same Record enumerates its fees in Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire. ?2 * 73 Clans.

In Michaelmas Term 1242, Margery de Say being apparently dead, Hugh de Mortimer, her son and heir, was suing William de Stuteville for waste. The first move in this litigation failed for want of form, and the Plaintiff had leave to prosecute in some other mode. It appeared that Stuteville had had issue by Margery de Say, and so held the Barony by Courtesy of England.80 Again in Easter Term 1243, the Suit was renewed,81 but ended in a Fine whereby Mortimer withdrew all impeachment of waste in the woods of Burford, Richard's Castle, etc., receiving at once the Manor of Hamme, in Worcestershire, the service of Robert de Clifton, in Clifton (Worcestershire), and the lands called Cascope.82 In 1245, William de Stutevill was assessed at \u00a35. on five Shropshire Fees to the Aid on marriage of the King's daughter,83 and in 1246 had quittance of \u00a310. similarly assessed for the Scutage of Gannok.84 In 1255, William de Stutevill was returned as holding Bureford in capite. It was a free Manor, that is, owed no Suits or Gelds. Stute vill had two carucates there in his demesne.85 On May 20, 1259, the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum issued on the death of William de Stutevill. Inquests were held in Worcestershire and Shropshire. The latter found him to have held nothing of his own inheritance, but only per legem Angli\u00e6, and of the inheritance of Margery, his former wife. Bureford, Wulfreton, Stepleton, and Wililegh in Walcherid were thus held. The Heir to all was Hugh de Mortimer, now forty years of age.86 Hugh de Mortimer had done homage to the King for his Barony on June 12, 1259. His Relief was fixed at \u00a3100.87 In 1260, his acquittance of the Scutage of Wales in respect of five Shropshire Fees, is improperly recorded as an acquittance of WU liam de Stutevill.88 A Patent of November 23, 1263, guarantees a protection for Hugh de Mortimer and his Knights, pending the War with Wales, against all suits at law, except Pleas of Dower, Mort d'Ancestre, and Novel Disseizin.

Being apparently at the siege of Kenilworth with the King, a Patent, date July 21, 1266, allows him to hunt the Hare, Fox, Weasel, and Wild Cat, in any of the King's Forests in Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Staffordshire. A Charter dated also at Kenil worth on November 16, 1266, grants him a weekly Market on Saturdays, and an annual Fair of three days (March 24, 25, and 26) at Burford, and the privilege of Free-Warren in Wichbold.92 The supposition that this Hugh de Mortimer was at any time Sheriff of Shropshire is erroneous. It was his Cotemporary, Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh, who held that office. I have avoided mentioning some trivial particulars about both persons, where it was not clear which of the two was concerned. The King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum on the death of Hugh de Mortimer of Richard's Castle, issued on Nov. 28, 1274, and an Inquest in pur suance thereof was held at Burford, on December 15 following. The Jurors found that the deceased had held two carucates in de mesne in Burford Manor, that two out of the three portions of Burford Church belonged to him as Patron, and that the Barony of Burford commanded no less than 32-j Knights'-Fees in different Counties. Half the Pleas and Profits of Overs Hundred belonged to Burford. This half was still worth \u00a32. per annum. It used to be worth \u00a34., but the withdrawals of Roger de Mortimer and the Abbot of Wigmore had reduced the value. The Pleas and Per quisites of the Manorial Court were 16s. The Manor was held per Baroniam, and its gross annual value from all sources was \u00a327. 7s. lOd. Robert de Mortimer, son and heir of the deceased, was of fuU age, viz. 22-^ years old.93 It is singular that on the very day on which the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum issued, as above mentioned, the Justices made Inquisition as to the state of Overs Hundred at Shrewsbury.

They said that the late Hugh de Mortimer had procured Burford to be made a Free Borough by Henry III, after the battle of Evesham, but that no Ferm was paid to the Crown on that account. Also since the said Battle the \"Baron of Bureford\" had appropriated a right of Free-Warren in Burford the Jurors knew not by what warrant.94 It is remarkable that about the time (1265-6) at which, according to the above Jurors, Henry III made Burford a free Borough, a Deed of which the following is the substance must necessarily have passed. \u2014 Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Hugo de Mortuomari Domi nus de Castro Ricardi dedi et concessi omnibus liberis Burgensibus meis de Bureford omnia Burgagia eorum cum pertinentiis; \u2014 tenenda de me et heredibus meis, eisdem Burgensibus et heredibus suis, libere et quiete, pro 12 denariis pro quolibet Burgagio annuatim solvendis.

The first Military Summons with which he was served was that against Lewellyn, when the Muster was to be at Worcester, on July 1, 1277.97 We have here a good example of the different estimates of the number of Knights'-Fees which belonged to or constituted any particular Barony.

Again the Fees assessable to Scutage were of higher amount than the number of Knights to be provided for any Mili tary expedition. Though Mortimer's Barony was composed of more than 30 Fees, and though he was assessed to Shropshire Scu tages, as if his Barony in that County consisted of 5 Fees, yet to the Summons against LeweUyn he only acknowledged that the per sonal services of three Knights were due in respect of his Western Baronies, viz. Richard's Castle and Burford united. These services he proffered to perform by himself and five servientes, viz. William and Hugh de Mortimer (perhaps his brothers), Thomas de Hunte leye, Philip de Stok, and Richard Carbonel. If more he owed, more he undertook to perform. His later military services may be esti mated by various Writs of the years 1282 and 1283 ; \u2014 but his Summons to the Parliament of Shrewsbury, to be holden on Sep tember 30, 1283, was a matter of more personal distinction.98 The Feodary of 1284 gives Robert de Mortimer as holding the Barony of Burford in capite, \"for three knights' -Fees,\"99 a state ment which was only true as regards forinsec services. I cannot indicate the period of Robert de Mortimer's death more nearly than by saying that an Inquisition consequent thereon sat at Burford on August 13, 1287. His Shropshire Fees were 7% in number. Their gross annual value, to his several Tenants, was \u00a389. 15s.1 Robert de Mortimer left his wife Joyce la Zouche surviving him. She had for her dower the Manors of Burford and Cotheridge. Ro bert de Mortimer also left two sons, Hugh and William. Hugh was under age at the time of his father's death, and had not livery of his inheritance till 1296. I cannot but think that he was son of a Wife of Mortimer's earlier than Joyce la Zouche. William, un doubtedly the son of Joyce la Zouche, succeeded eventually to his Mother's inheritance, and was called William la Zouche de Mor timer. As son of Robert de Mortimer, and probably having a younger brother's portion in Rochford, he confirms his Ancestors' grants of Rochford Mill to Haughmond Abbey,2 which is all that I shall say of him here.

His Summonses, Military and Parliamentary, are very numerous for the five years (1297 to 1301) of his short public career.3 In November 1297 Hugh de Mortimer settled his estates by a Fine and Counter-Fine, levied at Westminster, under a Royal Pre cept. By the Fine he conveys to William, Bishop of Bath and Wells, Plaintiff, his Manors of Farleye (Hampshire), Aumbreden and Hobrigg (Essex), Nymyngton Regis (Devonshire), Norton (Nor thamptonshire), Cotheridge (Worcestershire), and Burford (Shrop shire), for which the Bishop is said to pay \u00a31000. 4 The Counter-Fine, dated a week later, gives the Bishop conveying these same Manors to Hugh de Mortimer and Matilda his wife, and the heirs of Hugh, for a like sum of \u00a31000. 5 Hugh de Mortimer (II) seems to have died shortly before August 5, 1304, the date of the King's Writ of Diem clausit extremum. An Inquest held on August 30th, recites how he had settled Burford on Matilda his wife, for her life, they having been jointly enfeoffed therein by William de la March, Bishop of Bath and Wells (Trustee as above), with remainder to the heirs of Hugh de Mortimer. These heirs were two infant daughters,* \u2014 Johanna, who was 12 years of age on Nov. 25, 1303, and Margaret, who was 8 years of age on Sept. 14, 1303. The Jurors said that the deceased had held Borevrd of the King per Baroniam, and for the service of 2\\ knights'-fees. Matilda, Widow of Hugh de Mortimer, is also said to have had three other Manors in Devonshire, Essex, and Northamptonshire, settled upon her in like manner.6 Wichbold and a large estate in Wales were further assigned for her dower in 1304, and this was subsequently increased; for upon her death, shortly before March 11, 1308, her dower was found to be far more extensive.7 At this time her eldest daughter Joan was wife of Thomas de Bykenore, on whose death without issue she remarried to Richard Talbot. Margaret, the youngest daughter, though little more than twelve years of age at the time of her Mother's death, was already the wife of Geoffrey de Cornwall. Between these Coheiresses was the Manor of Burford divided. The Barony is still in Abeyance among their Descendants. I should observe that in this same year (1308) died William de Mortimer of Hamme, and an Inquest held on Dec. 9, at Ludlow, found the two Coheiresses of Burford to be also his Coheirs in several 3 Parliamentary Writs, I, 749. 4*5 Fines (Diverse Counties),25 Edw.

We may further notice how ignorant local Juries were as to the exact age and state of infant heiresses ; for this Inquisition of December 1308 makes Joan and Margaret each one year older than the Inquisition of 1304. Moreover the Ludlow Inquest of December 1308 says that Margaret was still in the King's custody, while the Worcester shire Inquest of even date gives the name of her husband. In speaking of the Undertenants of Burford I must here con fine myself to those of the Vill of Burford only, for the many mem bers of the Manor will require a separate notice. On May 4, 1216, King John orders that Roger de Ledeswic shall have seizin of a Mill and of a Noke of land in Bureford, his efforts to recover which, by process of law, had been impeded by the War9 (ap parently preventing all judicial proceedings at Westminster). John Anglicus the Tenant of the Mill would seem to have been accused of some treasonable conduct untruly. In June 1236, one Geoffrey de Burford occurs, as enfeoffed by Hervey, Abbot of Haughmond, in three virgates in Rocheford, at a rent of 40s. 7d., and for 4 merks paid down. \" Geoffrey, surnamed Junior, son of Philip de Burford,\" afterwards quit-claimed these premises to the Abbot ; Sir Peter de Grete and Sir John de la Mare, Knights, attesting the surrender.10 In February 1259, William, son of Robert Chone, has a Writ of Novel Disseizin against Simon de Prene for a tenement in Burford.11 For this Writ he is charged 20s. on the cotemporary Pipe-Roll. BURFORD CHURCH. The Church which, with two Priests, Domesday assigns to this Manor, was probably Collegiate from a still earlier period. It is in Trinity Term 1253 that I next hear of Burford Church. It then consisted of three Portions, one of which, being vacant, was claimed to be in the patronage of the Lords of Burford, then represented by William de Stutevill. Peter de Grete was the other Claimant, and obtained the presentation pro hac vice from Stutevill by an agree ment, for which Peter paid 1 merk.

Two of these, valued at 20 and 15 merks respectively, were in patronage of the Lords of Burford, the third was in the gift of the Lord of Greet.13 The Inquest on the death of Robert de Mortimer in 1287, gives him all three Portions, and values the third Portion at 10 merks, the others as before.14 The Taxation of 1291 gives the three portions of Burford Church, in the Deanery of Burford, as worth \u00a316. 13s. 4c?., \u00a39., and \u00a35. 6s. Sd. respectively : that is, 25, 13\u00a3, and 8 merks.15 It should be observed that the least valuable of these three portions was never- theless styled the second Portion, and as such I shall hereafter speak of it. An Inquisition of 1308 gives the three Portions of Burford as worth \u00a320., 20 merks, and \u00a310. respectively, and puts them all as having been in the gift of Matilda de Mortimer, late Lady of Burford.16 In 1325, the Rectors of the first and second portions having claimed their prebends to be without cure of souls, an In- quest held in July found that each Prebend was charged with such a Cure, and that they were taxed, the first at 25 merks, the second at 8 merks, and the third at 13-j merks.17 In 1341, the Inquisition of the Ninth quoted the Taxation of Burford Church correctly at \u00a331., but as if there were certain Chapels included in that estimate.18 The Assessors rated the Parish at \u00a312. 0s. 3d. only, to the Ninth. The reasons for the reduction were because eleven virgates lay fallow, being held by incapable Tenants, and because the Founda tion, Rents, and Lands of the Church (valued at \u00a37. 2s. 6d.), the Hay-tithes (valued at \u00a35.), the small-tithes, offerings, and other ecclesiastical profits (valued at \u00a310.), were included in the Church- Taxation, and as I presume could not be taken to indicate any quantities of wheat, wool, and lamb, produced in the Parish, such as were now proposed to be assessed. In 1534-5, John Hewys, Richard Benson, and John Gorle, the then three Portionists of Burford, certified their collective prefer- ment to be worth \u00a323. 13s. 4d. per annum in Glebe land and Tithes.

Hamo de Cursun, a Rector of Burford, is noticed in 1255 as having prosecuted two Laymen before Judges Delegate. One (Hugh Carbonel) had accused him of killing a Chaplain ; the other (William Harang) had taken security from Hamo for a debt due to him.20 It is not clear that this Hamo held the first Portion, nor can I tell which Portion of Burford it was that was cotemporarily held by the notorious \u2014 Giles de Norfolk, so often mentioned in these pages.21 William de Blankeneye, Incumbent of the first Portion, dying in 1274, the King, on Dec. 15, as Custos of the lands late Hugh de Mortimer's, presented \u2014 Stephen de St. George to the same.22 On May 21, 1278, the King had heard that this, his beloved Clerk, was molested by the Bishop of Hereford, who sought to enforce residence upon him, and to oblige him to take further Orders. The King reminds the Bishop of what he believed him to know already, viz. \" that the King's Clerks need not keep residence nor take full Orders, so that they be in some Orders.\" The Bishop is ordered to desist. Stephen de St. George is the first-named Incumbent in the Taxation of 1291, but on October 23rd of that year, he was deceased, and the King, as Custos of the heir of Hugh de Mortimer, presented- \u2014 Hugeline de Gerardinges, of Lucca, to his vacant Portion.23 Sir Richard de Wynton, Deacon, was instituted to a prebendal portion here, April 19, 1301, on resignation of his Predecessor. \u2014 Patron, Sir Hugh de Mortimer, Knight.

INCUMBENTS OF THE THIRD PORTION. Geoffrey de Bureford, Clerk, occurs on Oct. 6, 1276, as en titled to this portion, of which however John de Sheldesley is to have present custody. Geoffrey has cotemporary license to study for three years, and to receive 6 merks per annum out of his Bene fice. He seems to have been very young, and to have been dis tinguished by a sobriquet accordingly ; for the Episcopal Register informs us that Geoffrey, surnamed Le Joevene, Incumbent of this Prebend, died on March 29, 1284, by reason of a wound on his head. This entrv is curiously supplemented by a Presentment of the Overs Jurors at the County Assizes of 1292. They told how that Geoffrey Young (Juvenis) of Bureford and Geoffrey, Parson of the Church of Burford, had fought in the fields of Burford ; how Young had struck the Parson on the head with a staff, whereby after three weeks he died. Young was now a Fugitive. He was outlawed. He had no Chattels to be forfeited. The Vills of Buraston and Overton were amerced for not having duly attended the Coroner's Inquest in this case. The King, for some cause or other, sent for a Copy of this Process, and the Court ordered one to be forwarded.25 Geof frey Young's Successor at Burford was \u2014 Master Robert de Lacy, Priest, instituted Sept. 18, 1284; the Bishop exercising a lapsed right of Patronage.

In 1365 it was found by Inquest that Le Smythes' Portion was non-curative, but compatible with the tenure of a second Benefice.

The Domesday estimate of Burford equals it to 6i hides. The Manor was probably coterminous with the Parish, and, if so, comprehended various Townships, which, ac cording to later Surveys, will, w*ith Burford proper, more than satisfy the required hidage. Thus we have Burford proper estimated to contain 2 carucates of demesne, Boraston is put at 2 hides, Whetmore at 1 carucate, Nash at f hide, Tilsop at 1 hide, Weston at 1 hide, Stoke at 1 hide, and Whitton at _ hide. The total of 6i hides and 3 carucates does not include Greet, whose contents I nowhere find stated. Thus Bur ford, as a whole, is found to have increased its reputed hidage very considerably, and that without any probable absorption of other Manors. BORASTON. This member of Burford was granted by one of the Lords of Burford to Worcester Priory. In 1188 Warin and Simon de Bure ston had paid the Sheriff of Shropshire half a merk for the plevin of Reginald fitz Warin. At the Assizes of October, 1203, Geoffrey de Bureston essoigned his attendance at the common summons, his Es soignor being Adam de Bureston.

In 1255 the Jurors of Overs Hundred found that the Prior of Worcester held two hides in Burestone of Sir William de Stutevill, and by gift of his Predecessors. The Prior only answered (in ser vices I suppose) for one hide, and not for the other, and he did no Suit whatever.27 Symon de Burestone, a Juror on this occasion, officiated in a like capacity at the County Assizes of January, 1256, and on a local Inquest in 1259. He was probably the Prior's Tenant. In 1259 Milo de Boraston and Thomas de Bereford (Bur ford) occur as Sureties for a fine of 6s. 8d. inflicted on the notorious Giles de Norfolk for some withdrawal (quia retraxit se). In No vember 1274 it was one of the charges against Robert de Trillek (Under Sheriff) that having Richard de Letybiuy of Buraston in prison on a charge of Larceny, he allowed him to go free.28 On Dec. 15, 1274, William de Buraston sat on a Burford Jury. These were all probably Tenants of the Prior of Worcester, whose interest at Boraston in 1291 is duly stated to consist of \u00a35. assized rents; four acres of meadow, worth 4s. per annum, and \\9d. per annum for pannage of swine.29 By a Deed of 30 Edward I (1301-2) the Prior and Monks of Worcester grant to Richard de Temedabur (Tenbury), Clerk, and John son of Richard de Boreford, his nephew, a messuage in Bur raston held by William Freman. \u2014 Witnesses: Robert Estormy, Walter de Clifford, William de la Hull, Adam de la Hull, and Ro bert de Lodewich.30 Boraston Chapel, as having been a mere dependency of Burford Church, has no distinct notice in ancient Records.

They also held Sutton (sometime known as Sutton Sturmey), Stanford (often called Stanford Sturmey), and a part of Lower Sapey, all in Worcestershire, under the Barons of Burford. Half a hide too in Richard's Castle, Herefordshire, and Nash, another member of Burford, were constituents of their Fee. The first of this race who 1 Rot. Bundred. II, 74. 28 Rot. Bundred.

The next is Robert Esturmi, who in 1183 is amerced half a merk, with some other Burford Tenants, for not making inquisition about some treasure trove. About this time he attests a Charter of Osbern fitz Hugh, which I shall give under Ashford Carbonell. He was living, and occurs more than once in the time of Hugh de Say II, that is be tween 1190 and 1196. At the Shropshire Assizes in October 1203 Robert Esturmi essoigns himself by Robert Barat in a suit of mort d'ancestre against Richard Wetemore. Afterwards at Worcester, this Suit was accorded, R,obert de Sturmi giving one merk for license so to end it. His Surety was Robert Wal.31 To Ptobert succeeded John Esturmi, who, having been in rebellion at the close of King John's reign, had returned to his allegiance before June 22, 1217, when Henry III orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to re instate him in his possessions.32 A Feodary of the Honour of Richard's Castle, which is entitled as belonging to the\" 13th year of King John (1211-12), but which must have been drawn up at least fourteen years later, gives John Esturmy as Tenant of li knights' fees in Sutton, Worcestershire,33 but makes no mention of his mesne interest in Whetmore. A list of Shropshire Fees pertaining to the Barony of Burford, and drawn up about 1240, gives John Storam (read Stormi) as holding \\ fee thereof in WeteniorA A Worces tershire Feodary, drawn up within five years of the same time, gives John Sturmi as holding \\ fee in Stanford Esturmi, \\ fee in Sapy, and 1 fee in Sutton (all in William de Stutevill's Worcestershire Barony) ; also \\ fee in Richard's Castle, Herefordshire.35 In Easter Term 1253 one Philip Esturmy was Manucaptor for Walter de Clifford's appearance in a Suit at Westminster, and was fined one merk for the default of his Principal.36 Hence the Shropshire Pipe Roll of the same year has the following entry : \u2014 Philippus Esturmy debet I marcam quia non habuit ,* the words quern plegiavit being al ways understood to follow this very usual and summary entry. The Hundred Roll of 1255 gives John Esturmi as then Mesne Lord of Wetemore in the Fee of Burford. It was reputed to contain one carucate of land, and to be a fourth part of a Knight's-fee.37 At the Assizes of January 1256 John son of John de Chirchehull was suing John son of John Les Sturmy for \u00a36. arrears of an annual rent of 31 Assizes, 5 John, m. 6. 32 Claus.

The Defendant appeared not, but the matter was settled by a Fine at the same Assizes, whereby the Defendant un dertook to pay the rent-charge in future and 4 merks of the arrears. The Plaintiff in turn remitted all further claim for damages. In the same year (1256) John de Stormy was returned among those who, holding 15 Librates of land, were not Knights. About 1266 Sir John Esturmi, Knight, stands first witness of Hugh de Mortimer's Charter to the Burgesses of Burford. On the death of Robert de Mortimer in 1287, John S tunny was found to have held the Manors of Kyngeshemede and Asche (Nash) under the deceased by i fee and \u00a3 fee respectively. Their annual value was \u00a310., but nothing is said about Whetmore. In 1301-2 we have already had Robert Estormy attesting a local Deed.38 From 1309 to 1322 Robert Sturmy occurs in many important situations in Worcester shire,39 but the connection of the family with Shropshire seems to have ceased. It is this Robert, I take it, who attested William la Zouche of Mortimer's Confirmation to Haughmond Abbey, already noticed. The Undertenants who held Whetmore under Esturmi come into frequent notice. In May 1199 Margery, apparently second wife and Widow of Reginald (it should be Peter) de Wetemore, was suing her step-son Simon, son of Peter de Wetemore, for dower in Wetemore, Shropshire, and Sutton, Worcestershire. There were several adjournments owing to the essoign or non-appearance of the Parties. Therefore the Sheriff of Shropshire seized into the King's hand a third of Wettemore and 19s. 2d. rent there, and a Mill of 5s. annual value ; also the Sheriff of Worcestershire seized one-third of Sutton.40 A year afterwards, viz. on June 8, 1200, a Fine was levied between Margery de Wettemore, Plaintiff, and Simon de Wettemore, Tenant, of one virgate in Sutton, and of one-third of the vill oi Wettemore, one-third of the mill there, and 2s. rent there ; all which she claimed as her dower by gift of Peter de Wettemore, her late husband. Simon conceded the whole to Margery for life, whereupon Margery renounced her right as far as regarded a third of the land pertaining to the aforesaid Mill.41 One Richard de Wetemore has been mentioned as having a Suit with Robert Esturmi in 1203. He was perhaps the same person with Richard de Wetemore, whom a Feodary, drawn up about 1230, 38 Supra, p. 327. 39 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 1475. \u25a0>\" Rot.

In 1253 Robert de Wetemore has a writ of novel disseizin against Adam Wele for a tenement in Wetemore. In 1255 Ernald deBarkeley was John Esturmi's Tenant of a caru cate in Wetemore. He paid 2s. annual rent, and did no suit to the Hundred.43 At the Assizes of January 1256 Osbert Barat names his son John as his Attorney in a suit against Ernald de Berkeley, whom he accused of having disseized him of seven acres in Wetemor. On the Defendant's part it was shown that one Richard de Wetemore having formerly enfeoffed his son Robert in the premises, had after wards ejected him and enfeoffed Osbert Barat. Upon this Robert de Wetemore had sued his Father for disseizin, and recovering the premises, had enfeoffed Ernald de Berkeley. The Jury found that it was only 1 acre and 3 roods which Robert de Wetemore had thus recovered against his Father, but that he had nevertheless occupied and transferred to Ernald de Berkeley seven acres. So that in fact Ernald was not the Disseizor oi Osbert Barat, but, if any one, Robert de Wetemore was. The Plaintiff, Osbert Barat, had leave to sue in another form.44 Some of these names will occur again. At the Assizes of 1272, the Inquisition of 1274, and the Assizes of 1292, William de Wetemore was on the Jury for Overs Hundred. Some other names occur in connection with this Township. \u2014 On September 24, 1199, a Fine was levied between Peter de Knitteton (Knighton, Worcestershire), Plaintiff, and Bernard de la Putte, and Hugh his Brother, Tenants, of half a virgate in Wette mor, whereof was recognition of mort d'ancestre. Peter now re nounces all claim, receiving one merk. This Bernard de la Putte occurs again at the Assizes of 1203, when he, with Alice his wife, withdrew a suit of novel disseizin against William Botterell for a tenement in Weston45 (Weston, near Burford, I presume) . Cornewood. \u2014 The vill or hamlet bearing this name is now lost, but Knighton Common, which lies over against Whetmore, across the Worcestershire border, is also called to this day Cornewood Common. Here it was that Geva de Tenbury, daughter of William, and Sister of Adam le Salvage, under consent and confirmation of Osbert fitz Hugh, granted four acres to Haughmond Abbey. \u2014 Wit- 12 Liber Ruler Scacc. fo. cxlv 43 Rot.

Between 1199 and 1204 a Confirmation thereof by Hugh de Ferrars, in return for a Palfrey presented to him by the Abbot of Haughmond, is attested by Walter de Clifford, John Haber, and William Carbonell.40 The husband of Geva de Tenbury had been Herbert de Tenbury, and his daughters Alice and Felicia, before the year 1221 confirmed their Mother's grant. \u2014 Witnesses: William Carbonel, John and Pagan his sons, Simon Chaplain, Robert Chaplain of Burford.46 In 1291 an assized rent of 2s. in Cromwode appears among the as sets of Haughmond Abbey.47 The Abbey, it appears, subsequently demised these four acres to one William Maye, for 4s. rent, but Robert Maye, son and heir of the said William, gave all his Tene ments in Cornewood (these four acres included) to William de la Hulle, of Wetemore. A deed remains in the Haughmond Chartu lary whereby, on July 28, 1348, Richard, Abbot of Haughmond, re news the old understanding with William de la Hulle.48 In 1541-2, a tenement in Tenbury, yielding 10s. \\Qd. per annum, appears as having belonged to the late Monastery of Haughmond.49 I find the following notices of other interests in Cornwood : \u2014 Richard de Duvill (in Easter Term 1241) failed in a suit of novel disseizin against Hamo de Curzun. The land in dispute was two acres in Cornewode.50 Of Hamo de Curzun we shall hear again. Also in 1255 one Osbert de Cornewode was a Juror for Overs Hundred, and in 1256 one Robert de Corwod a Recognizor in a Whetmore Inquisition. NASH, anciently ESSES. This member of Burford was held under the Seignoral Lords by Esturmi. Esturmi's Undertenant took name from the place. Hence the Feodary of 1230, before quoted, gives Walter de Esses as hold ing half a fee in Esses of the Honour of Richard's Castle ; omitting to mention the mesne-tenure of Esturmi. I have spoken of this Walter de Esse under Neen Sollars,51 of a third of which Manor he was Undertenant in 1240.

Hence the Inquisition of 1255 says that Wil liam de Clifford holds three-fourths of a hide in Esses of John Es turmi for a rent of 100s. per annum, and does suit to Overs Hun dred.52 William de Clifford was on the Jury which made this re turn, as also was he on the Overs Jury at the Assizes of 1256. On June 30, 1257, William son of Walter de Clifford is suing William de Clifford and others for disseizing him of a Tenement in Esses, and Amicia del Esse in a writ of novel disseizin, taken out in Au gust following, alleges a disseizin by the same Defendant both in Esse and Neen. The relations of these parties I cannot discover without further evidence. I find William de Clifford on several subsequent Juries, viz. that on the death of William de Stutevill in 1259 ; at the Assizes of 1272 ; the Overs Inquisition of November 1274 ; the Inquest on Hugh de Mortimer's death in December 1274, and on an Inquest concerning Greet in August 1278. On the last occasion one William des Esses was also a Juror. At the Assizes of October 1292, Walter de Clifford, probably successor of William, was on the Overs Jury. Here, or hereabouts, a branch of the great house of Mauveysin had sometime an interest, but the mode of their tenure I cannot declare. William Mauveysin, a Juror on a Whetmore Inquest in 1256, sued John Baret at the Assizes of that year, for disseizing him of common pasture in 24 acres in Esses, and got a verdict.53 On May 19, 1284, John Mauveysin and Isabella his wife allow them selves by Fine to have given to William de Mortimer a messuage and virgate in Aysse, on which a rent of one rose is reserved to themselves and the heirs of John.54 In Easter Term 1292 the same John and Isabel allow by Fine a similar gift in Ayshe juxta Bure ford to John de la Devise, who is said to give them a sore sparrow hawk?* At the Assizes of 1292 John Mauveysin was on the Overs Jury. Other persons also occur as interested here. \u2014 In 1252 Hamo de Curzun sues William de Puclesdon for disseizing him of a tenement in Esse; and another Writ taken out in 1254 charges the disseizin as in Esse, Burford, and Wetemore.

His Writ seems to have cost him half a merk, as charged in the Pipe Roll of 1256, pro habendd assisd. In the last year he was himself sued by his Father's widow for her dower, viz. by Alice widow of Edward Atc- Chire, for a third of half a virgate in Chyre. The Court gave him license to render it up. In 1272 (as alluded founder Aston Eyre)55 John fitz Aer sued Adam Wele of Hulle for a messuage and half virgate in Schyre. It seems that Adam Wele's seizin arose through the demise of Hugh le Cak of Schyre, whom Fitz Aer alleged to be a Tenant in Villanage, and so incapable of transferring his tenancy. It appeared that if so, he did not hold under John Fitz Aer, but under John Fitz Aer's Mother. The Litigants accorded.

On April 15, 1330, King Edward III grants license to William de la Hulle to assign land and rent, of the yearly value of five merks, to a Chaplain serving in the Chapel of St. John Baptist, of Ash Sturmy, for the souls of himself, etc.56 I only find mention of one Incumbent, viz., \u2014 John Baret, nephew of William de la Hulle. He occurs in 1331. TILSOP. Elmbridge in Worcestershire was held under the Barons of Richard's Castle by a race of Knights who took their name from the place. These Elmbridges also held Tilsop under the same Ba rons.

In 1255 Simon de Tilleshope held a hide in Tilleshope of Sir Ichenard de Aumerugge for term of his life. It was of the Fee of Burford, was estimated to be held for a third part of a knight's-fee, and did suit to Overs Hundred.61 Before 1266 (as I infer from the testing clause of Hugh de Mortimer's Charter to the Burgesses of Burford) Ichenard de Elmbridge was succeeded by Sir Adam de Elmbridge. At the Shropshire Assizes of October 1272, Adam de Elmerugg, Knight, was a Juror on causes of Grand Assize, as well as for Overs Hundred. In August 1278 he was first Juror on an Inquest concerning a Tenement in Greet. In 1284 the Feodary gives him as holding Tilleshopp of Robert de Mortimer for half a knight's-fee. In August 1287 he is set down as having held, under Robert de Mortimer deceased, the Manor of Tilesope by a third of a knight's-fee. Its annual value was \u00a35.62 On the decease of Matilda, widow of Hugh de Mortimer, in March 1308, Adam de Elmerugge was found to hold Elmrugge (Worcestershire), and also the Manor of Tilleshop (the last by a third part of a knight's fee) in the Barony of Burford.63 Before September in this year (1308) Adam de Elmerugg was dead, and an Inquest held at Tilsop valued his estate there at \u00a34. 17s. 2d. per annum. Roger his son and heir was aged 26 years at Michaelmas 1307. Another Inquest valued Aumeridge in like manner,64 obviously because the Barony of Burford was in custody of the Crown, and not yet apportioned between the heirs. GREET.

A nearly cotemporary Deed in the Haughmond Chartulary has the more intelligible attestation of Philip de Grete.65 In 1199 Philip de Greet became party to a law suit about land in Stoke, which lasted five years. I will give the details under Stoke. In or about 1210 Philip de Grete held two thirds of a knight's-fee of the Honour of Richard's Castle.66 I shall show under Weston that Philip de Greet was still living in Novem ber 1221. His successor was Geoffrey de Greet, who appears as holding -| fee in Greet in a Feodary which the Record attributes to the 13th year of King John (1211-12), but which was probably drawn up about 1230. In 1237 Geoffrey de Crette and John de Bedesdon are jointly amerced half a merk for some non-attendance.67 The Feodaries of 1240 are unanimous in assigning to Geoffrey de Grete the tenure of a whole knight's-fee in Grete, under the then Baron of Richard's Castle.68 In Trinity Term 1243 Geoffrey de Grete being dead, Agnes his Widow was suing William de Stute vill for one-third of the Manor of Grete as her dower. Stutevill not appearing, the land was seized for the Crown, and the cause adjourned till August : Agnes named her brother Richard as her Attorney therein.69 To Geoffrey de Grete succeeded Peter de Grete (II), who in 1254 fines one merk for license to accord some lawsuit. In 1255 Philip de Thonlonde (Thongland) held three-fourths of a fee in Grete, at ferm under Peter de Grete, of the Fee of Burford. He did suit to Overs Hundred.70 On April 15, 1259, Margery de la Berne has a Writ against Peter de Grete for disseizing her of a tenement in Grete. The Pipe-Roll of the same year gives Peter de Grete as amerced half a merk for disseizin.

In August 1267 this Philip de Yanglonde, as he is written, names Thomas de Grete as his Attorney in a suit of mort d'ancestre against Susanna de la Leye. The question tried was whether \" Richard Kene, father of Susanna and Alice de la Leye, had died seized of half a virgate in Possethorne, now held by Philip de Thongelande, Parson of the Church of Grete ?\" Philip's defence was that he had already been impleaded in this matter by others, and that the present Plaintiffs should properly vouch him a warranty of his tenure, for he produced a Charter whereby Richard Kene their Father had granted this half virgate in pure alms to the Church of St. James of Thonglonde (it should surely be Grete) . The Plaintiffs maintained that their Father had died seized of the premises. The Jury found otherwise, and the Sisters were non-suited, but excused all amerce ment on account of their poverty'.76 In 1291 we find the Church of Grete, in Burford Deanery, valued as under \u00a34., but as if independent of Burford Church.77 Never theless the Inquisition of 1341 evidently intends to include it among the Chapels of Burford.

The land in dispute was a virgate in Stoke,85 but I cannot find the result of the suit. We learn or may infer that part of the estate of two coheir esses, Agnes and Margery de Stoke, of whom Agnes was wife of Samson de Estham, was claimed by Philip de Greet. The Feodary of 1210 gives Samson de Estham as holding one sixth of a fee in the Shropshire part of the Barony of Richard's Castle, and William de Spineto as holding another sixth.86 I sup pose these two sixths to have constituted the \\ fee by which two Coparceners appear at subsequent periods to have held Stoke. If so, William de Spineto was probably husband of her who had pre viously been called Margery de Stoke. About 1230 we have Mar garet and Roger de Estham as together holding -J fee in Stoke, of the Honour of Richard's Castle.87 Here, I presume, the name De Est ham is intended to apply to Roger only ; for Margaret, being pro bably either widow or daughter of William de Spineto, can only have been called De Estham by mistake. Roger de Estham was doubt less son of Samson. In 1255 we find Dame Agnes de Stoke and the Infant heir of William the Moneyer (Monetarii) as Coparceners in Stoke, but by what descent from the former Coparceners I can not say. Probably Agnes represented Roger de Estham. The Record makes Stoke to be a hide of land, half of which was held by Dame Agnes de Stoke for an eighth part of a fee, under William de Stutevill ; the other half was held by Master Simon de Radnor as Guardian of the Minor above-named, and by the eighth part of a fee. Each moiety did suit to the Hundred.88 In 1256 Simon de Radnor fines half a merk for some Writ, and in 1259 we find him associated with Henry fitz William and others, in a Fine, the purport of which is not declared, besides himself fining 20s. for license to accord a lawsuit. Henry fitz William thus named, seems to be identical with Henry le Moneur the heir of a moiety of Stoke. We find him under the latter name as a Juror at the Assizes of 1272, on the Hundred Inquest of November 1274, on the Inquest after Hugh de Mortimer's death in December of the same year, and on a Ludlow Inquest in January 1284. Meantime the other moiety of Stoke, held by Dame Agnes de Stoke in 1255, went to Robert de Munslow. He seems to have been Bailiff of Overs Hundred under Hamo le Strange, and therefore between the years 1262 and 1267. His conduct in that office was straightly questioned by the Overs 85 Placita and Essoign Rolls, passim. 86 ' 87 Liber Ruber Scaccarii, fos. cxxxviii, and cxlv. 88 Rot. Hundred.

Also one Tho mas de Stoke sat on a Ludlow Jury in January 1284. The Feo dary of 1284 gives Robert de Mumselauwe and Henry le Muntare as jointly holding Stoke of Robert de Mortimer by one-third of a Knight' s-Fee, a statement which is substantively repeated by the In quest on Robert de Mortimer's death in August 1287. It is added on the latter Record, that the whole Hamlet was worth \u00a34. per an num. At the Assizes of 1292, Henry le Moneur was one of the two who chose the Overs Jury. An Inquest of April 1308 gives Henry le Moneour and Margery le Blak as holding the Hamlet of Stok for \u00a3 of a knight's-fee.89 Henry le Moneour was soon afterwards suc ceeded by his son John, as will presently appear under Whitton. WESTON. This member of Burford was held by the Cliffords under the Lords of Richard's Castle and by the Lords of Greet under Clifford. Hence in November 1221 a Fine is levied whereby Philip de Gret ham, Tenant of half a virgate in Weston, enfeoffs Richard, son of Richard Lupus, in the same, at 5s. rent and for 5 merks paid down. The premises had hitherto been in dispute between Philip and one Richard Pulein, who claimed them under writ of mort d'ancestre, but now- acknowledged himself to have been only a Tenant in vil lainage under Philip.90 In 1255 Philip de Thongland (whom we have heard of under Greet) held a hide in Weston at ferm. He held it (like Greet) of Peter de Greet, and it was of the Fee of Sir Ro ger de Clifford. It did suit to Overs Hundred. The Record omits to say that it was a' member of Burford, and so held by Roger de Clifford under William de Stutevill.91 In 1256 one William Coke rel of Weston was reported by the Overs Jurors as non- attendant at the Assizes. The same person, called William Keterel of Weston, was, with Nicholas de Estham, Surety for one party in a suit con cerning land in Bitterley. He was probably an Under-Tenant, as was Nicholas de Weston, whom John Baril (Under-Sheriff to Hugh de Mortimer of Chelmarsh) first arrested for larceny, and then let go without other warrant than a bribe of 4s.93 On the death of Robert de Mortimer in 1287, we find the Heirs of Roger de Clifford holding the Hamlet of Weston under the deceased for half a knight's 89 Inquisitions, 1 Ed.

Its annual value was 40s.93 William de Weston, occurring about this time on local Juries, was probably Clifford's Undertenant here. An Inquest of April 1308 represents the Earl of Lincoln as holding the hamlet of Weston by half a knight's-fee in Burford Barony.94 This Earl, I should observe, represented the elder line of the Cliffords, \u2014 not the line of Roger de Clifford above named. WHITTON. About the year 1174 William de Witet (or Wieetre, as I mis rendered the name95) attests a charter of Osbern fitz Hugh already given. About the year 1180 William de Witinton, Tenant I sup pose here under Osbern fitz Hugh, attests a Charter of that Baron which I shall give under Ashford Carbonell. In the last attestation he is followed by Hugh his son, who I suppose succeeded him in estate; for one Hugh de Wittindon being dead in September 1199, his Widow Margery levies a Fine with William de Wittindon, whereby -she renounces for 4^ merks all claim of dower in Wit tinton.96 William de Witenton, thus succeeding, was I suppose he who was put in misericordid at the Assizes of 1203 for essoigning some Juror improperly, when the homicide of Walter de Snitton was to be investigated by the Hundred of Overs. The next entry on the Roll mentions one Osbert de Witenton, who having found a man crushed by a fallen tree, was not forthcoming to give account of the matter.97 He also appears on the essoign-roll as essoigned by Roger fitz Julian. He was nevertheless in misericordid. The Feodary oi 1210 gives William de Witinton as holding under the Lords of Richard's Castle by Serjeantry, but the nature of his service is not stated.98 In Michaelmas Term 1233 John de Whi tington essoigns himself in a plea of land against Walter Black (Nigrum) and Agnes his wife, the Essoignors being Hugh fitz Nigel and Gilbert de Whitington.99 In Easter Term 1236 a Plea appears on the Rolls which indicates, I think, a prospective sale by John de Witton of some property here. A day (in the Quinzaine of Michael mas) is given to Walter Tug^ of Estham and Agnes his wife, Plain tiffs, and to John de Witton, Tenant ; evidently that they may at tend and receive a Chyrograph ; for it is added, that John de Witton 97 Assizes, 5 John, m. 2. 98 Liber Ruber, so. cxxxviii. 93 Inquisitions, 15 Edw.

Also Henry Rugefef, a free tenant of John de Witton, was to be in Court the same day, and acknowledge the services by which he held.1 On November 15, 1236, a suit of mort d'ancestre wherein John le Waleis and Matilda his wife impleaded John de Whitenton, Tenant, for half a virgate in Whitenton, ended in a Fine.\u2014 The Plaintiffs renounced their claim, and John de Whitenton enfeoffed them in 9\\ acres at \\2d. rent.2 Again on February 3, 1237, a Fine was levied between William le Neir (Noir) and Agnes his wife, Plaintiffs, and John de Whitinton, Tenant oi 1\\ virgates in Eston, Worcestershire, and of half a hide in Whitinton, Salop, whereof was Plea. The Plaintiffs renounce their claim, but John de Whitenton gives them Feoffment in 1J virgates in Rochull, Salop ; \u2014 to hold at 2d. rent ; \u2014 to William and Agnes and the heirs of Agnes under John de Whitenton and his heirs.3 In 1255 half a hide in Wyttone had come by some means to the heir of William le Mouner (Monetarii) of Ludlow. This estate owed suit to Overs Hundred, and like Stoke was in custody of Master Symon de Radnor, as Guardian of William le Mouner's heir.4 A Deed of 1311-2 has the attestation of \"John de\" (read le) \" Muneter, Lord of Whyttone.\" The following were probably Undertenants to Le Mouner. \u2014 William Bonet, a Juror on the Overs Inquest of 1255, was Tenant of a messuage and quarter- virgate in Wytton, for which Walter fitz Alured sued him in 1256 alleging his (Walter's) brother, Adam fitz Alured, to have died seized thereof. The prosecution failed.5 In William le Blak, a Juror at the Assizes of 1272 and on the Overs Inquest of November 1274, we recognise a descendant of Wil liam le Neir, the Feoffee of 1237. In December 1274 we have John le Neyr as Juror on a Burford Inquest, and both John le Blak and William le Blak as Jurors on a Greet Inquest in August 1278. In Hilary Term 1278 we have Richard le Neyr and Margaret his wife conveying by Fine 3s. 2d. rent in Rokhull and Stoke to Hugh de Vuylle, whereof was plea of warranty.

In January 1284 John le Blak occurs as Juror on a Ludlow Inquest. Whitton Chapel seems to be merely a modern substitute for the more ancient Chapel of Greet. At all events, if Whitton had an ancient Chapel of its own, that Chapel was most implicitly sub ject to Burford Church, and not a single Incumbent thereof appears on the Hereford Registers. OVERTON. A place thus named is now lost, but it seems to have been mano rially a member of Burford, though by circumstances of tenure it is usually associated with Ashford Carbonel, which was in Culvestan Hundred. I distinguish as best I can between this Overton, in Overs Hundred, and another place of the same name which was a member of the Manor of Richard's Castle. The Carbonels held the former Overton of the Barons of Burford ; but I shall speak of the Carbonels more fully under Ashford Carbonel. In 1255 Hugh Carbonel is said to hold a quarter of a hide in Wn'tone, of William de Stutevill, and to do suit to Overs Hundred.6 On the death of Robert de Mortimer in 1287, the Inquest associates Overton with Ashford Carbonel as both held by Richard Carbonel for half a Knight's-fee.7 So in April 1308 Hugh Carbonel held both manors of the estate of Matilda de Mortimer, deceased, and was himself on the Jury which made this return.8 HULLE, now COURT OF HILL. Hulle in Overs Hundred was a member of Burford, but there was another Hulle a member of Richard's Castle, not always dis tinguishable from this. The Hulle of which I now speak was held in 1221 by William de la Hulle, against whom William de Stute vill having a suit at law, was essoigned? The Feodary which I have ventured to date about 1230 gives Robert de la Hulle as holding a twelfth part of a Knight's-fee in Hulle of the Barony of Richard's Castle 10 and it is noticeable that the tenure is stated between the tenures of Stoke and Tilsop. In 1240 Hugh de Hulle held an eleventh part of a fee in Hulle of the Barony of William de Stute- 6 Rot. Hundred. II, 74. 9 Assizes, 6 Hen.

It was held for the eleventh part of a knight's-fee, and did suit to the Hundred.13 The Record does not state the fact that it was held under William de Stutevill as Lord Paramount, nor yet that Roger de Pynlesdone was Guardian only of the heir ; which I presume to have been the case. At the Assizes of 1256 Adam Wele was Bailiff of Overs Hundred, but Simon de la Hulle, whom I take to have been his late Ward, occurs as Surety for Hamo de Curzun in a Lawsuit. Adam Wele appears on a local Jury in 1259, and in 1272 has been mentioned under Shire,13 a place close adjoining to Hulle. About 1266 we have had Symon de la Hulle attesting Hugh de Mortimer's Charter to the Burgesses of Burford.14 At the Assizes of 1272 and at the Overs Inquisition in November 1274 Simon de la Hulle was a Juror, and in Decem ber following both he and Adam Wele sat on the Inquest on the death of Hugh de Mortimer. Adam Wele was a Juror at the Assizes of 1272 and on a Greet Inquest in 1278. In Trinity Term 1283 Symon dela Hulle was I think dead, leaving a son Adam, and a widow Dionysia, now the wife of Ralph de Shyreburne. This is suggested by a Fine wherein the said Ralph and Dionysia his wife quit-claim to Adam de la Hulle a messuage and a third part of a virgate in Hulle which was Dionysia's dower in the inheritance of the said Adam. For this release Adam gave 9 merks.15 The Feo dary of 1284 gives Adam de la Hull as holding the vill of Hull in Overs Hundred under Robert de Mortimer by one-sixth of a Knight's-fee.16 The Inquest on Robert de .Mortimer's death in 1287 gives Adam de la Hulle as still Tenant of the Hamlet of Hulle, of 20s. annual value, but as held by the eleventh part of a Knight's-fee.17 At the Assizes of 1292 Adam de la Hulle was a Juror for Overs Hundred. Adam de la Hulle was succeeded as Lord of Hulle by William de la Hulle, whom I take to have been son of the said Adam; but cotem porary with, and probably holding under William, was another Adam de la Hulle, whose Father's name appears to have been Hugh.

The Fine purports to be the result of a Plea of Conven tion ; and William de la Hull paid 100s. for the same.19 Again, in Easter Term 1307 a Fine was levied between William de la Hull and Alice his wife, plaintiffs, and Adam son of Hugh de la Hull, Deforciant, of one messuage, one carucate of land, 8 acres of meadow, 40 acres of bosc, and 17s. rent iu La HuWjuxta Hyntes, whereof the parties had a plea of convention. William de la Hull first acknowledges that the premises are the Deforciant's by his (William's) gift, whereupon Adam concedes them to William and Alice and the heirs of William, to hold of the Lords of the Fee. For this, William is said to give \u00a310.19 The Inquest held at Bur ford, April 2, 1308, on the death of Matilda, widow of Hugh de Mortimer, gives William de la Hull as then holding the Hamlet of La Hulle for the eleventh part of a knight's-fee, of the Lords of Burford. Adam de Hulle was one of the Jurors who made this re turn.20 By Deed dated at Bishop's Castle, Dec. 14, 1311, William de Mortimer, Canon of Hereford, gives, for a sum of money, to William dc la Hulle and Alice his wife, a messuage and lands in Rokhulle and Greete, together with all rents and services due from William son of Roger de Ledewych, Geoffrey son of Peter de Rok hulle, and William son of the Lady of Greete. \u2014 Witnesses : John de (read le) Muneter Lord of Whyttone, Phibp Lord of Greete, Walter de Clifford.21 One Thomas de la Hulle occurs in November 1316 as Juror in the Inquest taken on the death of William de Ludlow ;22 but I can not affirm that this Thomas was of the place now under notice. William dela Hulle was certainly living in 1331, when he grants to John Baret his Nephew, Chaplain of Ash Stormi (i. e.

Domesday, after describing Nene in Condetret Hundred as held by Siward under Osbern fitz Richard, proceeds as follows : \u2014 \" To this Manor (Nene) there is adjacent one Berewick, Mulstone in Ovret Hundred.

He (Osbern fitz Richard) found it waste.\"' This instance of a Manor being in one Hundred while its Berewick was in another, is less remarkable than a case already discussed under Morville.2 When Neen (Sollars) became annexed to Overs Hundred, the previous anomaly of course vanished, and both Milson and Neen Sollars are to this day reputed to be in Overs Hundred, though their Manorial connection has entirely ceased. I presume Siward to have been Domesday Tenant of Milson, though the Record hardly implies as much. The next mention which I find of the place is as held by Feoffees of the Lords of Burford, who had adopted the local name of \" De Muleston.\" We have seen William de Muleston attesting, about 1174, a Charter of Osbern fitz Hugh his Suzerain.3 A later Charter of the same Baron, which I shall give under Ashford Carbonel, has the attestation of Gilbert de Muleston.

William de Mullestone was still Stutevdl's Tenant here by half a knight's-fee, and did suit to the Hundred of Overs. He had been in ill health the whole year.8 At the Assizes of 1256 William de Mulleston was found to have dis seized Hugh de Wodcnerton of half a virgate in Mulleston, but the Defendant did not appear in the cause.9 He was also reported as a Defaulter by the Jurors of the Hundred. It is probable that he was of advanced age ; for, on the death of William de Stutevill in 1259, the first Juror on the Inquest was Nicholas de Muleston. In Easter Term 1260, Nichola, Widow of William de Muleston, had been suing several of her late husband's Undertenants for her dower, viz. Robert fitz William of Wychecot, William fitz John and Eva his wife, William fitz Richard and Matilda his Mother, Philip fitz Hugh and Emma his Mother, for thirds of small parcels of land in Dodestone, etc. All the said Tenants had called Nicholas son of Wdliam de Muleston to warranty, but he had repeatedly failed to appear. So now it was decided that they should all hold their tene ments in peace, and that Nichola should have an equivalent of her claims out of Nicholas de Muleston's lands.10 At the Assizes of August 1267 Nichola Widow of William de Milston was sued for disseizing Sibil fitz Robert of six acres in Milston. The prosecution failed because the Plaintiff, a Minor, had never been seized.11 The Overs Inquisition of 1274 speaks of one William fitz Hugh, whom I shall presently show to have been a Coparcener in Milson, as having sat in the full Hundred-Court of Overs between 1272 and -> \u25a0 3 Liber Ruber, fos. cxxxviii, cxlv. 6 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. leston and Nichola his wife for non-prose cution of some suit-at-law. This points to the decease of WiUiam as later than Mi chaelmas 1259. I may here remark that the appearance of an elder son on a Jury does not necessarily imply the Father's previous death, though it is consistent with an idea of the Father's superannuation. 7 Fines, Vol. II, p. 68. 8 Rot.

Another less intelligible statement seems to imply that in the year 1271 or 1272 this William fitz Hugh had been challenged for a murder, that the then Sheriff was Hugh de Mortimer, but that a succeeding Sheriff had seized and still detained the chattels of the accused, valued at 10 merks.13 In Trinity Term 1277 a Fine between Nichola de Mulston, Plain tiff, and William le Mareschal and Alice his wife, Impedients, con veyed a messuage and 20 acres in Mulston to the Plaintiff, as the gift of Christiana de Gardino, whose Cousin and heir Alice was, \u2014 to hold to Nichola and her heirs, of William and Alice and the heirs of Alice, at lc?. rent. Nichola gave 10 merks for this. In Hilary Term 1283, Nichola, widow of William de Mulstone, Plaintiff (Hugh de Dunville being her Attorney), obtains by Fine a quit-claim of a messuage and half virgate in Mulstone, from Thomas de la More and Matilda his wife, \u2014 granting for themselves and the heirs of Matilda. Nichola, for this, gave one merk. On June 25, 1284, a Fine was levied between William son of Hugh de Cloune, Plaintiff, and Nichola daughter of Nicholas de Mulstone, Deforciant, of half two messuages, two-thirds of a carucate of land, and 41s. rent in Mulston aud Dodeston. Nichola acknowledged herself to have given the premises to the Plaintiff, reserving a clove-rent and capital ser vices. She also concedes that all Tenements which Sibil, widow of Nicholas de Mulstone, held in dower, and which after said Sibil's death would revert to herself, should go to the Plaintiff. This Fine, for which the Plaintiff paid 80 merks, was levied in presence of the said Sibil, who came into Court acknowledging that she claimed nothing except as her dower ; for which she did fealty in Court to William son of Hugh. In 1284 the Feodary gives John Godard and William fitz Hugh as holding Mulston by half a knight's fee of Robert de Mortimer. On the death of Robert de Mortimer in 1287, the Inquest states that the Heirs of William de Mulston were Tenants of the Manor, and that it was worth \u00a38. per annum?3 Mow John Godard and William fitz Hugh were heirs of William de Muleston I cannot determine. At the Assizes of 1292 Hugh Godard was a Juror for Overs Hundred. An Inquisition of April, 1308, gives Hugh Godard as holding the Manor of Mulston for half a knight's-fee of the Barony of Burford.14 The Nomina ViUarum of 1316 gives Hugh Godard alone as Lord of this Vill?h 12 Rot.

It is noticed as follows : \u2014 \u2022 \" The same Osbern (fitz Richard) holds (of the King) Tedenesolle. Sauuard held it (in Saxon times) and was a Free Man. Here is I hide geldable. There is (arable) land (sufficient) for three and a half ox-teams. In demesne there is one team, and (there are) in Serfs and in Boors with half a team. There is a wood which will fatten xl swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 6s. (per annum) ; now it is worth 10s.\" 1 The Manor thus described in Domesday is sometimes called in later documents the Manor of Merebrook ; sometimes Merebrook and Tetneshull are spoken of as two Manors, sometimes as different members of one Manor. Now I have before shown that Cleobury North, Hopton Wafre, and a place called M\u00e6rebroc, were early in Edward the Confessor's reign the property of the Church of Wor cester, and though the Church lost the two former, Seuuard, or Siward, continued Tenant of both till a later period.3 The same thing seems to have happened with regard to M\u00e6rebroc ; for we must treat Tedensolle and M\u00e6rebroc as convertible names when applied to the Manor now under notice ; and as to the identity of Seuuard and Sauuard, that is very obvious. The situation of this Manor 1 Domesday, so. 260, a, 1. K Blakeway's MSS. 17 Supra, p. 238. 2 Compare Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 22, 23."], [824, "350 TETNESHULL AND MEREBROOK. is the next question ; and it is one which will call for a good deal of evidence, and yet remain, I fear, in some doubt. The question is, whether this Manor stood in the South-Eastern or in the North-Eastern extremity of Overs Hundred ? \u2014 The col lective evidence on each side would be decisive in itself, were it not neutralized by the collective evidence on the other side. I will state the alternatives of this curious dilemma as completely as I am able. In favour of the Manor having been in the South-Eastern quarter of Overs Hundred, we have the following considerations. A glance at the Map will detect a district of Shropshire lying southward of Milson and Neen Sollars, but surrounded on the East, South, and West, by Herefordshire. In this district the River Rea unites with a small stream called Mill-brook, and the two thus joined are after wards known only as the Rea. Near to their confluence is a place called Malbrook ; and on the Rea, previous to their confluence, stands Tetstill Mill. In these names I think we may have the represen tatives of the more ancient M\u00e6rebroc and Tedenesolle ; and I shall give one instance of M\u00e6rebroc having been called Melbrook as far back as the thirteenth century. But I will render other reasons for thinking it probable that Tedenesolle, alias M\u00e6rebroc, lay in this particular quarter. The two adjoining Manors on the North are Milson and Neen Sollars. Both of these were, like Tedenesolle, held by Siward in the reign of the Confessor, and all three were Osbern fitz Richard's at Domesday. Also in the thirteenth century, as I shall presently show, this Manor of M\u00e6rebroc is mentioned in the Surveys consecutively with Milson and Neen Sollars. Again, in 1272 we have the Lord of Tetneshull and Merebrok suing the Lords of Neen Sollars for rights of common in the latter Manor, \u2014 a very strong argument that the Manors were adjacent. Lastly, in 1292 we have the widow of a Lord of Tetneshull claiming dower both there and in Neen Sollars. In favour of considering this Manor to have been in the North- Eastern quarter of Overs Hundred I submit the following evi dences :\u2022 \u2014 Mr. Blakeway identifies M\u00e6rebroc which belonged to the Church of Worcester, with Morbrook near Aston Botterell ; and his account seems to intimate that one of the tributaries of the Rea, rising in the Clee-Hill, was at its source called Morbrook. This information was not intended by Mr. Blakeway as relative to the situation of the Manor of Tetneshull and M\u00e6rebrok, but rather as showing how"], [825, "351 TETNESHULL AND MEREBROOK. common the name Morbrook, or Merebrook, was. In fact, I sup pose that any small stream rising among moorlands might be called Morbrook itself, and might impart the same name to any Vill or settlement on its banks. But a document of the year 1301 describes the Manor about which we are inquiring by a very pertinent name, viz. as Tetneshull under the Cle. Now as Overs Hundred did not approach the Great Clee Hill, and as it nearly surrounded the Titterstone Clee Hill, one might suppose that we have in the latter that Clee under which was Tetneshull. Moreover it is not very extravagant to suggest that the names Titterstone and Tetneshull may have originated in a common root. A glance at the Map makes it further apparent, I think, that the district about the Titterstone Clee Hill stood aloof from the nearest of surrounding Manors ; neither is there anything in the early history of these surrounding Manors which would sug gest an idea that any of them trenched on this district. On these grounds one might be inclined to assume that the Manor and the lost Vills of Tetneshull aud M\u00e6rebrook occupied a district adjacent to the Titterstone Clee Hill. I now proceed with the history of the district whose situation is thus left undetermined. \u2014 The Manor of Tedenesolle, alias M\u00e6re broc, came at a very early period to be held under the Barons of Richard's Castle by another Baronial house, viz. that of Corbet of Caus. The Corbets of Caus held also two Manors in Worcester shire under the Barons of Richard's Castle, viz. Impney by a whole Knight's-Fee, and Astwood by half a fee. This Feoffment of Corbet probably indicates a gift in frank-marriage with some Lady of the house of Say to a Corbet of Caus. The Tenants of Corbet in each of the three Manors which he thus held of the Honour of Richard's Castle were different. Impney was held by a younger branch of Corbets ; Astwood by a family called De Astwood ; Tedenesolle by the Arundels, who also held Habberley, a member of Corbet's own Barony. Of these Arundels, Lords of Tedenesolle and M\u00e6rebroc, I have the following particulars. \u2014 Between the years 1180 and 1199 Adam de Arundel, Lord of this Manor, occurs more than once in the general affairs of the County or in those of his Suzerain, \u2014 Robert Corbet of Caus. At the same period was living one John Walsh (Wallensis), who is found in company with Robert Corbet on an indifferent occasion hereafter to be noticed, but who seems to have disputed Adam de Arundel's title to this Manor. In 1 195 John Wallensis fined \" three merks"], [826, "352 TETNESHULL AND MEREBOOK. to have right against Adam de Arundel in respect of half a knight's fee in Tatehal and Marebroc.\"3 This suit was still unsettled in 1199, when John Wallensis is opposed to Wido de Arundel, the successor of Adam, and to Robert Corbet, whom the said Wido had called to warranty. * Thus among the Essoigns at Westminster on June 27, 1199, we find Robert Coket (read Corbet) and Wido de Arundel essoigned against John Wallensis by Richard Russell and Wdliam Brito. In Hilary Term 1200 \"Robert Corbet appomts in his own place Wido de Arundell, against John de Seldes\" (an other name of the Plaintiff) \"in a plea of warranty in TotenhiU and Merebroc, wherein Wido cads Robert Corbet to warranty.'^ In Easter Term 1200 the cause came on for hearing, John Wa lensis suing Robert Corbet immediately for half a Knight's-fee in Tutenishill and in Merebroc. Corbet appeared, and at once called to warranty the heir of his own Feoffors, the Says. This was Margery, daughter of Hugh de Say, an Infant at the time; and the Suit was consequently adjourned till she should be of age.6 In Easter Term 1201 Guido de Arundell was again a Defendant for his interest in Thikeshell and in Marebroc. It was one hide (the Domesday measurement of TedenesoUe) , and was claimed by one William de Lendeslee as his right. Guido in this instance made no appeal to Corbet his immediate Seigneur, but at once called the daughter of Hugh de Say to warranty, who being stdl in minority this case also was adjourned.7 The Feodary, which I have ventured to date about 1230, gives a second Adam de Arundel as holding half a knight's-fee in Tetneshull and Marebroc of the Honour of Richard's Castle.8 Here Corbet's mesne interest is omitted, as it again is in the Feodary of 1240, which gives Adam de Arondel as holding half a fee in Merebroc of the Barony of William de StoteviU.9 In 1255 the Jurors who made Inquest as to the Tenures in Overs Hundred seem to have been Knights. John de Arundel is the second on the Panel. Among their statements is this one.\u2014 \"John de Arundel holds one hide of land in Marebroc of Sir 3 Rot. Pip. 7 Ric. I, Salop. 4 Rot.

On February 3, 1264, John, son of John de Arundel, has a Writ of mort d'ancestre against Thomas Corbet concerning a messuage and lands in Habbcrley and Tet neshull.11 John de Arundel the second, as 1 presume he may be called, was Foreman of the Jury which took the Overs Inquest in November 1274. He was second Juror on an Inquest about Greet, in August 1278. In 1284 we have the statement which I have before alluded to as strengthening the notion that we have in Malbrook the place usually, but not always, called Merebroc in the thirteenth century. In this instance it is called Melbrok ; and John de Arundel is stated to hold it for half a Knight's-fee of Peter Corbet, while the same Peter held it of Robert de Mortimer.13 On the death of the latter Baron in 1287, the tenancy of Arundel here is not mentioned in the Inquest ; but Peter Corbet is said to have held, on the day of Mortimer's decease, the Manor of Tet treshull and Marebrok for half a knight's-fee, and the Manor to be worth \u00a38. per annum?3 On May 8, 1288, we have Sir John de Arundel, knight, attesting a Buildwas Charter.14 Before October 1292 John de Arundel (II) was deceased, leaving a Widow Isabeda and a Son (a third John) his heir. At the Assizes of that year, Isabella, the Widow, was suing several Te nants of her late husband for dower. She sued Agnes, daughter of John de Arundel, for thirds of a messuage and half virgate in Taneshull and Burywod; she sued Sibil, widow of Nicholas de Multon (Milson, I presume15) for thirds in Neen Solers; and she sued Isabel, widow of William de Stepelton, for thirds in La Wode house. All these Tenants called John, son of John de Arundel, to warranty. The result in the first case of the three was that Agnes had an equivalent for the thirds sought against her out of the lands of the said John de Arundel (III) . In the second case, Sibil showed that she was only Tenant for life ; the premises in Neen Solers being entailed on her daughter Agnes. They both agreed 10 Rot. Hundred.

To this Isabel replied, that the said gift of a mill, etc., was a simple gift, and no exchange. So Isabel had her dower in this instance, and Sibil her equivalent, out of John de Arundel's estate. In the third case, Isabel de Stepelton showed that she held for term of life, and with remainder to Robert her son. John de Arundel being called to Warranty, said, as to this parcel in La Wodehouse, that his Father could never have given dower in that, because he had never been himself seized thereof. Tbis plea he afterwards withdrew, and had to find an equivalent for the dower taken out of Isabel de Stepelton's tenement.16 On October 6, 1297, a Fine was levied, whereby John de Arundel entailed, subject to his own life and with a small reservation, two parts of the Manors of Tetteneshul and Habberley on Robert Corbet of Moreton, Matilda his wife, and the heirs of the said Robert. According to the language of the Fine, John de Arundel, Plaintiff, acknowledges the right of Robert Corbet to the premises, except three messuages and two virgates in Tetteneshul and Hab berley. In return, Robert Corbet and Matilda his wife concede the premises to John de Arundel for life ; \u2014 to hold of Robert and Matilda and the heirs of Robert at a rose-rent, and by performance of all capital services ; \u2014 with remainder to Robert and Matilda, \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee.17 On the 15th of November, 1300, Robert Corbet having died, and the Escheator having seized the Manors of Haberleye and Tetneshull-under-the-Cle into the King's hands; and Matilda, Ro bert Corbet's widow, having complained to the King that she was enfeoffed in these and other estates conjointly with her late hus band, the King orders the said Escheator to send him full infor mation on the subject. An Inquest held at Moreton Corbet on January 15, 1301, found that Robert Corbet and his wife had been jointly enfeoffed by John, son of John de Arundel, in all the said John's lands in the vills of Habberleye aud Tetneshull and Mere brok: \u2014 also that John de Arundel was still holding for life two thirds of the premises, but that Robert Corbet had died seized of the remaining third ; and that the whole constituted a knight's-fee beld under Peter Corbet.18 It is clear then that Robert Corbet 16 Assizes, 20 Edw.

I, Salop."], [829, "355 EARLS DITTON. had been enfeoffed in the whole of these estates previous to the above Fine, and that the Fine was only a subsequent and tem porary arrangement in respect of two-thirds thereof. Whether Adam Arundel, who has been named on an Easthope Jury in 1306,19 was descended from the old Lords of Tetneshull I cannot declare. Certain it is that Robert Corbet's descendants enjoyed the fee simple of the estate now under notice. A Feodary of April 2, 1308, mentions only the mesne tenure of Peter Corbet of Caus, viz. that he held, under the Lords of Burford, the Manor of Teteneshull and Marebrok for half a knight's-fee.20 An Inquisition ordered June 12, and held June 20, 1309, on the death of Matilda, widow of Robert Corbet of Moreton, foimd her to have held the Manors of Tetneshull, Marebrok, and Habberleye, under Sir Peter Corbet, for half a knight's-fee. The Inquest values the pleas of the Manorial Courts at Is. only, because the said Courts had none who did suit thereto (quia non habent sectatores) ?l Of Undertenants in this Manor I have no notice, unless it be in the instance of William, son of Geoffrey de Tctteshill, who at the Assizes of 1226 was amerced 6s. 8d. for disseizin,22 and who, as William de Tetneshull, was acquitted of a second charge of the same nature.23 \u20acarte Btttmu Domesday supplements its account of Cleobury Mortimer, in Condetret Hundred, with mention of Mawley and two other small estates, which had been so annexed to Cleobury as to be valued therewith in the Record. The Survey then proceeds thus, \u2014 \" And in Ovret Hundred there is i hide, Dodentone, which itself also is valued in the same,\"1 i. e. in Cleobury. We have seen in the case of Ditton Priors, that the Dodentone of Domesday became Ditton ; also in the case of Detton, that that is the contracted form of a place written in Domesday as Dodentone.

It is Doddington Liberty therefore which represents as a whole the Domesday Dodentone, so that we have the uncontracted form for the district in general and the contracted form for a parcel thereof. The addition of \" Earls\" before Ditton marks a distinction from Detton and Ditton Priors. The prefix alludes to the Seigneury of the Mortimers as Earls of March, and therefore we do not find it used in the thirteenth century. The territory here spoken of was probably held in demesne by the Mortimers ; and what we have said of their Manor of Cleobury in general, must be taken to include Doddington Liberty. There is one remarkable exception to this rule : for I think it was here that the estate lay which in 1260 was settled by Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, on the marriage of his daughter Isabel with the heir-ap parent of the House of Fitz Alan. A Fine levied at Westminster, on May 14, 1260, sets forth the whole contract. John Fitz Alan (II) is Deforciant of 100 merkates of land in Norton and Atton, whereof was plea of convention between him and Roger de Mortimer, Plaintiff. The said John concedes, that if it should come to pass that he should outlive John his son and heir, who, not being yet fourteen years of age, had married Isabel, Roger de Mortimer's daughter, then that the said 100 merkates of land should remain to Isabella, \u2014 to hold under John (II) and his heirs for her life, in name of dower. Again, if John fitz Alan, Junior, when he arrived at 14 years of age, should wish to oppose the marriage-contract between himself and Isabel, the 100 merkates aforesaid should nevertheless remain to Isabel for life, and be for her. maintenance, but after her death should revert to John fitz Alan and his heirs. In return, Ro ger de Mortimer conceded, in marriage of his daughter Isabel, 40 Librates of land in Dudinton, Salop ; \u2014 to hold to John fitz Alan, Junior, and Isabel, and their heirs, under Roger and his heirs for ever. If John fitz Alan, Junior, died without heirs, and Isabel sur vived him, she was to have the said 40 Librates for life, with rever sion to Mortimer. And besides this, Roger de Mortimer paid clown 400 merks of silver.2 Fines Dicers. Comitat. tern. Hen. Ill, Bundle VI. No. 67, Oxon. Salop.

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 48s. per annum. Now it is worth 10s. When he (Mortemer) received it, it was worth 3s.\" l There can be little doubt, I think, that this Manor went to constitute a part of the great fief which Le Savage held under Mortimer, but there is no evidence that, in this case as in many, Le Savage was preceded by Ingelrannus. The inference is, that Le Savage's Tenure was not all inherited, but increased by succes sive grants of the Suzerain. Le Savage's successor at Corley was De Overton, of whom I have said so much under Eudon George and Overton. .Richard de Overtoil's interest in Corley seems to have arisen before the extinction of Le Savage's male line ; for Adam le Savage was living in 1210, while in November 1208 a Fine was levied, whereby Aldith and Margery fitz Benedict, Plaintiffs, con ceded to Richard de Huverton, Tenant, half a virgate in Corneleg, whereof was suit of mort d'ancestre. For this renunciation the Tenant gave them 8s. It is probable therefore that Richard de Overton was Savage's Undertenant or Grantee before he was defi nitively his Coheir. I just repeat the former statement, that in 1240 Geoffrey de Overton's tenure of a knight's-fee under Ralph de Mortimer was in Overton, Eudon George, and Cornley, and pass to the year 1255, when the Overs Inquisition says, that Geoffrey de Wuerton holds one (hide) of land in Corley of Sir Roger de Mor timer for a fourth part of a knight's-fee, and does suit to Overs Hundred.

Corley was one of those Manors which, soon after the battle of Evesham (1265), Mortimer removed from Overs Hundred and an nexed to his Honour of Cleobury. An Inquest which took more particular cognizance of this matter than the Hundredal Inquest of 1274, estimates the King's loss as 2s. per annum, from the with drawal of the Lord of Cornlegh from those Hundred Courts of Overs which were held every three weeks; \u2014 at \\8d.ior the withdrawal of the Vill from two annual appearances ; \u2014 and at \\2d. from the dis continuance of the Hundred-fee? In Hilary Term 1278 a fine was levied between Hugh le Vuylle, plaintiff, and Roger son of William (which William was Parson of the Church of Cornleye) impedient, of a messuage and 50 acres of land in Cornleye. Roger acknowledged Hugh's right as by his (Roger's) gift. Hugh conceded the premises to Roger for life, at a rent of 28d. payable to himself; \u2014 and with reversion to himself, to hold of the Lords of the Fee.5 Later in the same Term, Hugh de Vuilla and Matilda his wife, Impedients, quit-claim for 10 merks to Nicholas de Hintes, Plain tiff, a messuage, 60 acres of land, and 3 acres of wood in Hintes and Cornleye, whereof was Suit-at-law.

The earliest notice which I have of Corley Church is implied in the Presentments of the Overs Jurors at the Assizes of 1292.

I have observed with regard to two Manors of his Brother Earl Edwin, that the salt-pits attached thereto naturally resulted from that Earl's interest in the Wiches of Cheshire and Worcestershire.2 This will not apply to a Manor of Earl Morcar, perhaps Brothers-in-law of the Patron. 1 Domesday, so. 256, b, 2. 2 Vide supra, Vol. II, p. 174, note 1, I and Vol. Ill, p. 329."], [835, "361 CA1NHAM. who had no share, or at least a very small one, in these Wiches. The annual quantity of salt therefore which was due to Cainham from one of the Wiches (of Worcestershire probably), was perhaps annexed to the Manor by the Norman Earl, or by Ralph de Morti mer. I now proceed to speak of that moiety of Cainham which Ralph de Mortimer held in demesne at Domesday. The Wigmore Annalist, telling how Hugh de Mortimer sounded and endowed that Abbey, places those events in 1179, and gives the Manor of Kay ham as part of the said endowment.3 The French Chronicle, on the accuracy of which I have learnt much rather to depend, couples this grant of Caynham with circumstances other than the founda tion of Wigmore Abbey. \u2014 \" Hugh de Mortimer gave Caynham to the said Abbey with his body,\" and so in prospect of his own burial at Wigmore.4 \" But a Lady,\" adds this Writer, \" continued to hold the town of Snytton in the name of dower.\" Hugh de Mortimer lived to see the Abbey of Wigmore dedicated, which, if the date of foundation were 1179, will have been within two years after; for Mortimer died in 1181. On the day of Dedication he renewed and confirmed his grant of Caynham. Roger de Mortimer, his Successor, had no sooner come into possession than he challenged the title of Wigmore Abbey to Caynham, and otherwise oppressed the Canons. When the Lady, who held Snytton in dower, died, he at first al lowed their title to that appurtenance of Caynham ; then he took it back again as a convenient halting-place in his journeys between Wigmore and Cleobury. It seems that on one of these journeys his wife, Isabel de Ferrars, was seized with sudden labour at Snytton. The death of her infant, her own danger, and the place where this visitation overtook her, seem to have suggested to a pious and im pressible mind some of those reflections which the Churchmen of that day never failed to turn to account. \u2014 She had been visited not with the ordinary curse of Eve, but with a judgment on the sacri lege of her husband. At her representation and prayer Mortimer restored the vill of Snytton to the Abbey, \u2014 to hold freely with the Manor of Caynham for ever. The Inquest of Overs Hundred in 1255, says accordingly that the Abbot of Wyggimore holds nn hides of land, in almoign, of Sir Roger de Mortimer, in Kahiham, and does suit to Overs Hundred.5 John de Cainham, a Juror on this occasion, was probably the Abbot's ham was again Juror for Overs Hundred at the Assizes of 1256. 3 Monasticon, VI, p. 349, a. 4 Wright's Ludlow, pp. 121, 126, 127. 5 Rot.

It is evident that Caynham, thus described, included Snitton, and that the two con stituted those four hides of the Manor which were Mortimer's demesne at Domesday. On the strength of Henry Ill's Charter (granted Oct. 4, 1265), the Abbot of Wigmore withdrew the suit of Cainham from Overs Hundred. He also assumed the privileges of having a gallows and of assizing bread and beer in the Manor.6 In 1291 the Abbot's receipts from Kayham and Sivitton are re turned as follows.\u2014 Rents, \u00a316.

In October 1302, William Beneth, Plaintiff in a Fine, acknow ledges himself to have given a messuage and half virgate in Kayn liam to Richard, son of William Beneth, and to Alice, daughter of Richard le Feure of Ash ton. The latter, for themselves and the heirs of Richard son of William, regrant the premises to William Beneth, for life, at a rose-rent, and he performing all capital services. Remainder to Richard and Alice. This Fine is evidently in the nature of a marriage settlement.8 In October 1304, Hugh Body and Alianore his wife, Plaintiffs in a Fine, convey a messuage, 70 acres of land, 1 acre of meadow, and 4 acres of wood in Caynham and Hopebagard to Philip, son of Roger Coterel of Ludlow, who in turn settles the premises on the Plaintiffs for their lives, with remainder to their son Hugh and Isabel his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, and in default of such heirs to the right heirs of Hugh son of Hugh.8 In 1534-5 the Abbot of Wigmore returned his rents and ferms derived from Caynham and Sutton (read Snitton) at \u00a337. 3s. 9d. ; the ferms and rent of certain corn (probably tithes) were \u00a32. The Demesne lands, including two small rents, yielded \u00a38. 7s. 4d. The Profits of the Court, from Fines, Heriots, Reliefs and amercements, were \u00a33. 6s. Sd.

But whether Hope were part of Robert Veci's three hides, or identical with the one hide held by Walter, I cannot say. I rather suppose the latter. This vill never passed to Wigmore Abbey as an appurtenance of Cainham, but was held under Mortimer as a distinct Manor, and by Feoffees whose name Bagard accounts for the distinctive title by which the place is now known. By a Fine levied in November 1240, Henry Faber of Rushbury, Plaintiff, re nounces to Robert Baggard, Tenant, a noke and three acres in Hop, which he had previously claimed under Writ of Grand Assize. In return, Baggard conceded him the noke at a rent of 2s. and on con dition that he should at his own cost furnish two men to assist in Baggard's Autumn-harvest for one day yearly. By another cotem porary Fine, Walter fitz Maurice, Tenant, renounces to John de Whytinton,16 Plaintiff, half a virgate in Hope Bagard; whereof was Plea. In return John de Whytinton concedes the premises to the Recognizor, to hold under himself at 5s. rent, and by performance of all capital services. \"And this concession,\" says the Record, \" was made in the presence and by consent of Robert Bagard under whom Walter previously held.\"17 A Feodary drawn up at this very period gives Robert Bagard as holding half a knight's-fee in Hop under Ralph de Mortimer.18 Two nearly cotemporary Lists very errone ously describe the Tenure as being under the Barony of William de Stutevill, i. e. of Richard's-Castle.18 At the Inquisition of Overs Hundred in 1255, Robert Baghard, of Hop (himself on the Jury), is said to hold one hide in Hope of Sir Roger de Mortimer, for half a Knight's-fee.

This was another of the Vills whose suit was withdrawn from Overs Hundred by Mortimer, on the strength of his oft-mentioned Charter of 1266.

The Pleas of the Crown entered as pertaining to Overs Hundred on the Assize Roll of 1292, show that in regard of some matters Hope Baggot was still reckoned in that Hundred : e.g. A Deodand of 7s. is recorded as chargeable on two wheels and a mill-stone in the Mill of Hope ; the inner wheel having dragged down Valentine, the Miller, whereby he died. The Inquest taken after the death of Edmund de Mortimer, in February 1305, gives Robert Bagard as holding half a knight's-fee in Hope Bagard under the deceased. THE CHAPEL. In 1291 the Chapel of Hopbagard, in the Deanery of Ludlow, being of less than \u00a34. annual value, was charged with a Pension to Bitterley : evidently as the Mother Church.20 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish only 20s. ; not quoting any previous Church- Taxation, but stating the actual value of the Foundation of the Church to be 6s. Sd. and the value of the small-tithes, offerings, and other profits to be 6s. 8d. more.21 In 1534-5 this Chapel is styled a Rectory, of which William Wyndell was Incum bent. Its glebe was worth 13s. 4d. per annum, its tithes \u00a32. 6s. 8d. It paid 6d. for Synodals to the Bishop, yearly.22 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

This place is parochially a member of Corley, but there can be little question that at the time of Domesday it was manorially an appurtenance of Cainham ; \u2014 for Corley, as a Manor, maintained its Domesday hidage in 1255, without including Hints; whilst Cainham at the same time, and even when reckoned to include Hope Bagard and Hints, was still two hides short of its Domesday complement. Three nearly cotemporary Lists of the Barony of Richard's-Castle have often been quoted above as belonging to the year 1240. 26 Each of them contains an entry, which, on examination, will be found re ferable to Hints. One of these Lists has Roger de Foxcote and his Coparceners as holding half a fee in Hintes of WiUiam de Stutevill. The other two Lists indicate Foxcote as the locality of the same Tenure, which is a palpable error. Less apparent but not less real is the error of all three lists in making the Tenure to be under Stutevill. It was under Mortimer of Wigmore. The same mis take occurring in the case of Hope Baggot induces the idea that it arose from Stutevill being Lord of Overs Hundred. The Overs Inquisition of 1255 both explains and corrects these earlier state ments. Then the three Coparceners in Hintes were Roger de Fox cote, Nicholas de Hintes, and the Infant Heir of William de Hintes. The latter was in custody of John de Lectone. The whole Manor was estimated as one hide, held of Sir Roger de Mortimer for half a knight's-fee and doing suit to Overs Hundred.27 We have already heard of Roger de Foxcote,28 and of Nicholas de Hintes, \u2014 of the latter as Tenant of a hide in Corley.28 In Easter Term 1260 Nicholas de Hintes was dead, and Felicia his Widow was suing his Undertenants or Feoffees for various parcels of dower. She sued Dionysia de Hintes (probably daughter of the deceased) for a third of a messuage and carucate in Hintes ; she sued one John fitz Alan for a third of a carucate, and William Gunny for a third of 3 acres in Cornlegh ; also she sued Ralph Tette and Richard the Carter, each 54 That is, I suppose, Nicholas, son of Henry de Eyton. 27 Rot.

All these parcels were seized into the King's hand, and the cause adjourned.29 Nicholas de Hints was generally succeeded by his son, another Nicholas, who has occurred to us under Corley, in 1263. Hints, after the Battle of Evesham, was withdrawn by Mortimer from Overs Hundred. The Suits and appearances thus lost were valued at 4s. per annum. The Hundred-fee paid by the vill had been Is. At the Assizes of 1272 Nicholas de Hintes was one of the Jurors for the Franchise of Cleobury. In 1305 the Inquest after the death of Edmund de .Mortimer gives John de Hintes as holding half a fee in Hintes and Opemonekete. Hill Uppencott or Luppencott is in Bitterley Parish, but must be taken to have been another of the Domesday members of Cain ham. It is the place already alluded to twice as Upmaneton and Opemonekete. I have nothing further to say of it. A glance at the Map will show the extent of the district which lay between Cainham, Hope Baggot, Corley and Hill Uppencott. This then was the territory which formed the bulk of the eight hides assigned by Domesday to Caynham, and the subsequent estimates (which men tion only six hides in Cainham, Corley, and Hope Baggot) must be taken to include the same territory as Domesday, rating it, as usual, at a lower hidage.

King Edward's time the Manor was worth 60s. per annum, and after wards it was waste, now it is worth 40s.2 A family named Esketot or Scotot held three Knights'-fees of old feoffment in Lacy's Herefordshire Barony. In 1165 the repre sentative of this family was Richard de Esketot ;3 but one Roger de Esketot, probably a Cadet of the House, had since the death of Henry I (1135) been enfeoffed by Lacy in a Knight's-fee and ac cordingly the Record of 1165 enters him as holding the same by new feoffment? This Fee was undoubtedly Bitterley ; and we find this identical Roger de Scotot granting 4s. rent out of his Mill of But terleg to Haughmond Abbey. His grant was attested by Nicholas de Huggeford and Ivo the Priest. Hugh de Lacy, as Seigneural Lord, ' confirmed this grant ; William, son of William fitz Alan, attesting.5 The names thus combined in this transaction indicate that it took place between 1173 and 1177. The Successor of Roger de Esketot was Hugh de Esketot, who in 1187 having failed to produce before the Justices-in-Eyre some woman, who had apparently been asso ciated with Money-forgers, was amerced in the heavy penalty of 15 merks.6 In 1192, \u00a37. 12s. 6d. of this debt being still due, the charge was transferred from the Shropshire to the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll.7 In Easter Term 1200, Hugh de Asketot was one of twelve knights chosen to try a cause of Grand Assize, which I have mentioned under Nordley Regis.8 Within the next ten years, as I conjec ture, Hugh de Esketot was succeeded by his son Roger ; for the latter, calling himself \" Roger de Scotud son of Hugh de Scotud,\" confirms the grant of 4s. rent, which his Ancestors had made to Haughmond Abbey.9 The witnesses of this are Osbert Parson of Diddlebury, Roger Parson of Butterley, and Osbern fitz WiUiam of Diddlebury; names which allow of a much later date than that which I assign to this Deed, and by inference to Roger de Esketot's suc cession. However, the first and third witnesses appear together in another document as early as 1212, and I am much mistaken if Roger de Scotud was not the person who before 1221 was usually known as Roger de Bitterley.

Stephen retained his right of making assarts, and Walter renounced all claim of common-pasture in Stephen's demesne-lands.13 In 1251 Stephen de Buterleg fines 1 merk pro habendo pone; \u2014 that is, I suppose, to change the jurisdiction of some lawsuit from the County to Westminster ; for in Michaelmas Term of the same year Walter de Huggeford appeared against him at Westminster to compel him to abide by the Fine already quoted.14 Stephen how ever did not appear, and the Sheriff was ordered to compel his at tendance in Easter Term by distraint. At the Inquest of Overs Hundred in 1255 Sir Stephen de Buterleg was Foreman of the Jury. \" He held three hides in Bitterley of Dame Margery de Lacy, by service of one Knight, and did suit to Overs Hundred.\"15 The Sei gneury of this Manor was, at the time, part of the dower of Walter de Lacy's Widow. Stephen de Buterle was again Foreman of the Overs Jury at the Assizes of 1256. In August 1260 and in Fe bruary 1263 I find him addressed as the King's Escheator in Shrop shire. In 1266, when King Henry III was before Kenilworth, he granted to this Stephen de Buterlegh a license to hunt in all the Forests of Shropshire. This was allowed at the instance of Peter de Nevill.16 On January 28, 1268, Stephen de Buterleg was ex empted by Patent from serving on any Jury, Assize, Recognition, etc. This was at instance of Roger de Mortimer. I have already quoted the Fine by which in June 1274 Stephen de Boterley Senior settled Rushbury on himself and his wife Alice for their lives, and with remainder to his Son Stephen.17 The settlement of Bitterley was precisely the same, except as regarded a messuage and a carucate of land there, which went at once to Stephen de Boterleye, Junior, being described as the \"messuage and carucate which Matilda, Widow 11 Testa de Nevill, p. 15. 35 dorso. 12 Inquisitions, 30 Hen.

The general reasons for reduction from the standard fixed by the Taxation were, \u2014 that four virgates in the Parish lay fallow ; the site of the Church, with its rents and lands annexed, was worth \u00a35., the hay-tithes were worth \u00a32., the small tithes, offerings, and other profits of the Church, having no relation to the Ninth, were worth \u00a35. Thus a sum of \u00a312. went to swell the Church-Taxation, which could not be accounted of in estimating the Ninth of Wheat, Wool, and Lamb.28 In 1534-5 the gross value of this Rectory, then held by Richard Bluntston, was \u00a322. 11s. 8d., viz. \u00a33.

Reginald de Bromfeld was instituted to Bitterly January 12, 1315, on presentation of Stephen de Buterle. Richard Dobyn, Acolyte, was instituted March 6, 1316, on pre sentation of the same. He has a license for non-residence in the same year. As Richard Parson of Buterley he occurs in 1322.33 I cannot say whether \u2014 Robert Dobyn, Parson of Bitterley, named in a Patent of 2 Edw. Ill (1328-9), is to be reckoned as another Incumbent, or whether there has been some error of transcription. John, Rector of Bitterley, who in 1346 has a two-years' license for non-residence, is probably the same with \u2014 John de Bitterley', who being dead in 1375, \u2014 Sir Edward Hopton, Chaplain, was instituted on October 8 of that year. \u2014 Patron Sir Hugh Cheyne, Knight.

Cleeton then possibly was an independent Manor at the time of Domesday, and was accidentally omitted in that Survey.1 Certainly it was a Manor -Sole in the thirteenth Century, and as such I must speak of it somewhere in Overs Hundred. I prefer to speak of it here because parochially it is a member of Bitterley. I am not aware of any Record of the thirteenth Century which intimates who were the Seignoral Lords of Cleeton, but that the Ledwiches, who held it over the Tenants-in-fee, held it immediately of the Crown I cannot for a moment suppose. Of these Ledwiches I have spoken already under Rudge and Abdon,3 and shall have to say more under Upper Ledwich, the place from which they took their name. In 1253 the second Geoffrey de Ledwich being dead, his widow Agnes, on October 8, fines one merk for a Writ of novel disseizin to be heard by Nicholas de Turri, a Justiciar of that period. We know from the Patent ordering the Trial that she proposed to sue Geoffrey de Ledwich (her son or stepson) for a tenement in Ledwich.3 Previous to this, viz. in Trinity Term 1253, this same Agnes had been suing two Undertenants at Cleton for her dower there. These Undertenants were WiUiam de Ledewyz, who apparently held the whole Manor except two virgates and a noke, and Thomas de Lede wyz, who held \\\\ virgates and 6 acres. With respect to the thirds of these tenements thus claimed by Agnes, the two Undertenants aforesaid sued their superior Lord, Geoffrey de Ledewyz (III), to appear in warranty* but the cause was adjourned, and I hear no more of it. About this time a fifth Litigant appears in this same famdy ; for a Patent of 1253 appoints Gilbert de Preston to hold trial of a suit (jurata) which Roger de Ledwic had against William de Ledwic for a tenement in Cleton.5 In 1255 WiUiam de Cletone (identical I doubt not with the last- 5 Patent, 37 Hen.

He also did Suit to Overs Hundred.6 At the Assizes of 1256 a cause was tried which shows us some thing more of the relations of these Ledwiches. One Geoffrey de Stratton, claiming to be son and heir of Isabel de Ledewych de ceased, sued William de Ledewych as holding half a virgate in Cle ton of which he (Geoffrey) alleged his mother to have died seized. WiUiam de Ledewych replied that Isabel had had an elder son Ri chard, who on Isabel's death came before Robert de Lexinton (his eyre was in 1240) and sued one Geoffrey de Ledewyz under writ of mort d'ancestre for this very half -virgate, and that he (Richard) then recovered the same, but had since enfeoffed Roger de Ledewyz therein, and that Roger had in turn enfeoffed William the present Defendant. William thus gained the cause, in the progress of which Roger de Ledewyz is called his Uncle, and Geoffrey de Ledewye of 1240 his Father.7 In 1257 I find William de Ledewich fining half a merk for a writ of Pone. In 1259 under the name of William de Cleton he appears as a Juror on the Inquest after the death of William de Stutevill. At the Overs Inquisition of 1274 Robert Clerk of Cleton was on the Jury. At the Assizes of 1292 John de Cleatuu occupied a similar position. The Feodary of March 1316 gives John de Chiton as Lord of the Vill of Cluton? Doubtless the Lords of Upper Ledwich still retained their Mesne interest here. f^nlep* This, the only Manor in Overs Hundred held by Rainald the Sheriff, is thus described in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Haneleu (of the Earl), and Roger holds it of Rainald.

The first Clinton of whom I hear is Hugh de Clinton, who in 1165 held a Muntator's fee (Henley no doubt) in the Barony of William fitz Alan.2 It was a fee of old feoffment ; that is, Hugh's ancestors had held it before the death of Henry I. In 1166 I find Hugh de Clinton amerced 20 merks for having renounced a Duel, the cause of which was some evil word spoken against the King,3 but whether by Hugh or his proposed Antagonist does not appear. Coincidcntly Hugh de Clinton was amerced one merk by Alan de Nevill, Justice of the Forest.3 After the Liber Niger was drawn up, there was an intermarriage between the families of Lacy and Fitz Alan, and a transfer of some Lacy fees to the latter Barouy. How far the marriage and the transfer were connected as cause aud effect does not appear, but the transfer was not all one way. Henley at least left the Seigneury of Fitz Alan and passed to the Honour of Lacy, probably because its pro pinquity to Ludlow was advantageous to the latter. In 1194 Hugh de Clinton was dead, and Ivo de Clinton, probably his son, was Lord of Henley and of Clee Stanton, the latter of which he held under Wenlock Priory. In December 1 1 94, Mabilia de Hennele, perhaps the widow of Hugh de Clinton, had a suit of dower against Ivo de Clinton, in which she essoigned herself by WilUam Geraii.4 Ivo de Clinton was deceased before 1203, leaving Hugh, his son and heir, in minority, with other issue, by Isabel his surviving wife, who was Sister of that William de Burley, and niece of that Helias de Hugley, whom I have mentioned under Higley.5 The next of this familv whom I shaU notice is Philip de Clinton, who in 1240 held Henle or Henneleg by half a knight's-fee, but held it not under Fitz Alan, but under Walter de Lacy.6 A further result of this change of Seigneury was that Henley became separated from Overs Hundred.

It was in fact a member of the Liberty of Ludlow. Philip de Henley thus spoken of was doubtless identical with Philip de Clin ton, the cotemporary Tenant of Clee Stanton under Wenlock Priory. The Inquest taken in November 1274, after the death of John de Verdun, gives Philip de Clinton as his Tenant of half a knight's fee.8 In 1284 Henley would seem to have been annexed to Muns low Hundred ; for under the Tenures of that Hundred, Ivo de Clin ton is entered as holding the vill of Henneleg for half a knight's fee under Theobald de Verdon.9 Ivo de Clinton in 1292 was one of the Jurors who tried so many Pleas of Quo Waranto between the Crown and its Shropshire Lieges. In 1300 he was a Juror on the great Perambulation of the Shropshire Forests. I shall have more to say of this family under Clee Stanton, and only add here that in March 1317 the Inquest after the death of Theobald de Verdon (II) gives Roger de Welyngton as Tenant of half a fee in Henneleye of the annual value of 40s., and held under the deceased Baron.10 Of Undertenants in Henley, I can only instance Walter de Buterley, sued in August 1257 for a Tenement here by Amicia, daughter of Hugh de Scotod under Writ of novel disseizin. On May 30, 1261, Amice fitz Hugh has a similar writ against the same Walter. At the Assizes of September 1272, one WiUiam de Hanleg was BaUiff of Overs Hundred. The Hundred-RoU of 1274 calls him and Richard dc Haunleye, Beadles of Overs Hundred under Hugh de Mortimer's Shrievalty (March 1271 \u2014 January 1273), and aUeges against them both an act of extortion, viz. that they took half a merk from the vill of Neen SoUers for non-attendance at the Gaol-delivery of Brug. Also William de Hanleye and another had appropriated 2s. 8d., the value of the Chattels of two Welsh Robbers who had been hanged, which money was the King's.11 ' Rot. Bundred.

It was waste and so remains.\"1 The Historians of Shrewsbury, perceiving that Domesday confuses the Church of St. Mary at Shrewsbury with that of St. Mary of Bromfield, account for the error of the Record in a most satisfactory way. \u2014 \"Domesday,\" they observe, \"was put to gether in London from loose notes collected in the Country : and it is highly probable that the Officers of the Exchequer finding two sets of entries of a Church of St. Mary in Shropshire, erroneously classed them together.\"2 The same Writers seem to mo not to have made the most of their discovery when they assign St. Mary's half-hide in Overs Hundred to St. Mary's of Shrewsbury : but of that presently. I would here re mark how Domesday, that unrivalled Record of facts, is instructive even in its omis sions. The Officers of the Exchequer unhesitatingly adopted a classification which took it for granted that more than one great Church dedicated to St. Mary was not to be reckoned on in a single Country. We have in this an illustration of the fact that the Domesday Churches of Shropshire were very few in number. The wasted half-hide which belonged to St. Mary's Church, in Overs Hundred, was very naturally without a name at the time of Domesday. Afterwards it was called Priest-Ledwich, and was a well-known possession of the great Saxon Church of St. Mary's of Bromfield. King Henry II, probably in the very first year of his reign, expedited a Charter of Confirmation to the Church in ques tion. Among the possessions which the Canons enjoyed in the time of King Henry I, and which his Grandson enumerates and confirms, that of Lethewic is the one which I here notice.3 A century later and Presteledewych was reputed to be a whole hide instead of the half-hide which we should have expected. The Inquest of Overs Hundred, taken in 1255, stated that the Prior of Bromfield held this hide of the King. He did no suit to Overs Hundred ; the Jury knew not by what warrant, but added that the Canons had a suffi cient charter of acquittance.4 Roger de Ledewych, one of these Jurors, and apparently a Knight, was not, I think, the Prior's Tenant but a Cadet of that family of Ledwiches which held Clee- i Domesday, so. 252, b, 2, 3 Monasticon, Vol. IV, 155. 2 Bist. of Shrewsbury, II, 303, note 1.

The Overs Jurors of 1274 said that the Prior of Bromfield had, in the time of Henry III, withdrawn the Suits of Ledewich and such other customs as he had been used to do to their Hundred.6 When this withdrawal was first disallowed I cannot say ; but the result is that Lower Ledwich, instead of having been restored to Overs Hundred, was annexed to Munslow, where it still remains. The Valor of 1534-5 places Leddwiche in the Parish of Bromfield, and gives \u00a34. as its annual value, in rents paid to the Prior.

Lapley was a gift by Earl Algar to the Foreign House, though of that fact Domesday does not in form us. If we are to suppose that Silvington also was given to St. Remigius by Earl Algar, it will probably have been at some un recorded period a member of Cainham. We are now to inquire the cause and the circumstances of the favour shown to a French Monastery by Algar, Earl of Mercia. The story is that Aldred, Archbishop of York, going on a mission to Rome, took with him many noble Englishmen, and among the rest, Burchard, a promising youth, the Son of Algar, Earl of Mercia. The Archbishop, returning by way of Rheims, this illustrious youth was there seized with mortal sickness, but before his death he requested that he might be buried in the Abbey of St. Remigius, promising in return that certain vills and farms of his inheritance should be given to that House. Earl Algar, with consent of Edward the Confessor, is said to have fulfilled his dying son's promise. There can be little doubt that this story contains the substantive cause of St. Remige's English endowments. Archbishop Aldred's embassy to Rome indeed was early in 1061, and the death of Earl Algar, if correctly placed in 1059, would suggest some doubt as to the particulars being true, but I find that a much later date is as signed by some authorities for Earl Algar's death, viz. 1063,4 which will not be inconsistent with the above narrative. The Monks of Rheims preserved a Charter purporting to be Earl Algar's grant of Lapley.5 I see no reason to suspect the documeut. It is in perfect consistency with the story above related, and is attested among others by Gisa Pr\u00e6sul, which proves it, if genuine, to have passed in or after 1161 ; for Gisa, Bishop of Wells, was consecrated to that See at Rome in AprU 1161, being, in fact, one of Arch bishop Aldred's companions. Henry I, I think soon after the banishment of Earl Robert de Belesme, addresses Richard de Belmi (Belmeis) and Fulqueius Sheriff, and all his Barons of Shropshire. He commands that the Monks of St. Remigius be aUowed to hold the land which they have in Shropshire as quietly as they held it in the time of WiUiam I aud William II. If any one injure the Monks, the said Officers 4 I have already (Vol. Ill, p. 63, note 3) placed Earl Algar's death in 1059. I had Dugdale's authority for this; but the statement which dates his death in the same year with that of Gruffyth Prince of Wales (1063) is perhaps the true one. 5 Monasticon, VII, p. 1042, No. i."], [858, "380 SILVINGTON. are to do them full justice. This Deed is attested by \" Waldric, a Chaplain, at Westminster in Council,\" and must have passed in December 1102.6 We have another Charter of King Henry I, addressed to Robert, Bishop of Chester, Nicholas, Sheriff of Staffordshire, and Richard de Belmeis, Sheriff of Shropshire. It forbids these persons from summoning the Monks of St. Remigius at Rheims to attend Hun dred or County Courts, but it allows them to send their Bailiffs or one of their Tenants. It is tested by Henry, Earl of Warwick, at Waltham, and must have passed between 1102 and 1108.7 As yet therefore St. Remige's estate in Shropshire has been distinguished by no specific name. We find it however caUed SUvintone before the year 1118. The Monks of Rheims preserved a most curious document, whereby Azmar8 their Abbot, by advice of Robert, Bi shop of Coventry, concedes to Aluric, a Clerk, the vill of SUvintone for 40s., to be paid on the feast of St. Martin (November 11th). The Tenant is to do homage by oath. His wife Edith and his sons and daughters shaU also do homage to St. Remigius and the Monks, and serve them as free men, i. e. not as Villains. If Aluric die aud his wife survive, 20s. is to be paid to the Monks ; if the wife die first, Aluric is to pay the Monks a third part of the goods which he shall have in the Vill. In case of any infringement of their duty to the Monks the Lessees shall do full justice at Lapley,10\u2014 in the Abbot's Court there, I presume. The Deed passed in the Court of St. Remigius, so that aU its witnesses are Foreigners. I suppose it may be called a Lease, for a Fine presently to be paid, and for a second Fine on the termination of the shortest of two lives. No rent is reserved, and the Vill probably was to revert to the Monks on the expiration of the second Use.

The next notice which I have of Silvington is as held by those Beysins whom I have spoken of so often. They held it in fee of the Prior of Lapley as representing the Abbot of St. Remigius. Hence the Overs Inquisition of 1255 certifies that \" Philip le Bret holds 1 hide in Silveton, and is Custos of the heir of Adam de Beysin, and he holds it of the Prior of Lappele for 24s. per annum.

I find no further mention of their interest in Silvington till the death of Thomas de Beysyn in 1319, when the Inquest values his receipts from this Manor at 5 merks per annum, and says that he had held it of the Prior of Lapley.15 On October 6, 1347, a Fine was levied between Richard de Haukiston and Agnes his wife, Plaintiffs, and Mathew, Parson of the Church of St. Nicholas of Silveton, and Roger of the More, Chaplain, Deforciants, of the Manor of Silveton, whereof was Plea of Convention.
