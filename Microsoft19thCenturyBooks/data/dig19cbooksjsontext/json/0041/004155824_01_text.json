Shortly after the inception of my project of a Dictionary of Authors, I determined, if life and health were continued, to supplement that work by a copious selection of Quotations from some of the works of the authors re corded in that register. The Poetical Quotations are now offered to the public ; and are to be followed by Prose Quotations : the three Dictionaries \u2014 Authors, Poetry, Prose \u2014 representing and partly constituting a literature marvellous for its extent, variety, and value. The advantages of well-arranged and easily-consulted extracts from the best writings of the best authors are too obvious to need rehearsal : and the alphabetical distribution of the names of authors, and copious Indexes of Authors, Subjects, and First Lines, carry with them their own recommendation. A few words may be devoted to several of the most prominent subjects : I. \"Authors.\" \u2014 Opinions and criticisms upon 116 writers, by 56 authors, are quoted. The writers commented upon are: Addison, Ariosto, Aristotle, Bacon, Berkeley, Boileau, Boyle, Broome, Budgell, Burgess, Burnet, Burns, Cartesius, Cato, Cervantes, Chatterton, Chaucer, Cibber, Cicero, Coleridge, Condorcet, Congreve, Corneille, Cowley, Crabbe, Craggs, Crashaw, Dante, Defoe, Denham, Dennis, Dionysius, Dryden, Duck, D'Urfey, Epictetus, Erasmus, Etherege, Eusden, Evans, Flecknoe, Fletcher, Franklin, Galileo, Gay, Granville, Harvey, Heylin, Hoadly, Hobbes, Homer, Horace, Jonson, Knags, Lamb, Lee, Locke, Longinus, Lopez, Lucan, M\u00e6vius, Martial, Martyn, Milbourn, Milton, Moliere, Moore, More, Newcastle, Newton, Ogilby, Ovid, Paine, Parnell, Petrarch, Pindar, Plato, Plutarch, Pope, Quarles, Rabelais, Racine, Raleigh, Ralph, Rochefoucauld, Roscommon, Rousseau, Rowe, Saint- Andre, Sappho, Scarlatti, Scott, Settle, ShadweU, Shakspeare, Sheridan, Short, Sidney, Skelton, Sloane, Socrates, Solon, Spenser, Swift, Theobald, Theo- critus, Thomson, Vida, Virgil, A^oiture, Waller, Walton, AVithers, Wycherly, Young, and Zoilus. The commentators are: Addison, Akenside, Basse, Blackmore, Browning, Brydges, Bulwer, Byron, Campbell, Canning, Coleridge, Collins, Cowley, Cowper, Creech, Denham, Dryden, Elliott, Fenton, Gay, Granville, Hall, Harte, Henley, Hill, Holmes, Horace, Johnson, Jonson, Lamb, Lyttelton, Milton, Moore, Parnell, Philips, Pope, Prior, Raleigh, Roscommon, Sandys, Savage, Shakspeare, Sheffield, Shelley, Shenstone, Sydney Smith, Southey, Spenser, Swift, Thomson, Tickell, AValler, Wolcott, AVordsworth, and Young.

II. \"Morning.\" \u2014 One of the finest compositions in the writings of the late Daniel Webster is a letter on the morning, written to Mrs. J. W. Paige, and dated at Richmond, April 29, five o'clock a.m., 1847. (See Private Corre spondence of Daniel Webster, 1857, ii. 240.) \"Beautiful descriptions of the 'morning' abound in all languages. . . . Milton has fine descriptions of morning, but not so many as Shakespeare, from whose writings pages of the most beautiful images, all founded on the glory of the morning, might be filled,\" etc. Under this title 152 extracts, from 38 authors, will be found. III. \"Rivers.\" \u2014 In his very interesting Recollections of Past Life (1872, chapter ii.), Sir Henry Holland remarks, \"Much more I could say of rivers, as giving to travel the greatest charm of landscape, while affording lessons in geology and physical geography invaluable to science. Even the simple brook, followed step by step to its course, illustrates, in the windings of its channel, its depths and deposits, and the sections which its banks disclose, many of the grandest phenomena and conclusions of geology. In the poetry of every age the flow of river-waters has been a favourite theme, \u2014 one symbol of the life and destinies of man.\" The reader will find 94 quotations under this head. \"Birds\" are celebrated in 260 passages by 45 authors; \"Law\" contains 194, \"Love\" 565, \"Politics\" 157, \"Sleep\" 242, \"Woman\" 291, and \"Youth\" 227 quotations. In the whole (as stated on the title-page) 435 subjects are illustrated, by 550 authors, in 13,600 quotations, which may be read in course, or consulted separately, as occasion serves. S. Austin Allibone.

Since she must go, and I must mourn, come night, Environ me with darkness whilst I write. Goldsmith : Traveller. Donne. Short absence hurt him more, Winds murmur'd through the leaves your short delay, And made his wound far greater than before ; Absence not long enough to root out quite All love, increases love at second sight. And fountains o'er their pebbles chid your stay: Thomas May : Henry II. But, with your presence cheer'd, they cease to mourn, Short retirement urges sweet return. Milton.

Thinking of thee, still thee, till thought grew pain, Forced from her presence, and condemn'd to live ! And memory, like a drop that night and day Falls cold and ceaseless, wore my heart away ! Unwelcome freedom, and unthank'd reprieve. MOORE: Lalla Rookh. Dryden. Ye flowers that droop, forsaken by the spring; Ye birds that, left by summer, cease to sing, Ye trees that fade, when autumn heats remove, Say, is not absence death to those who love? Love reckons hours for months, and days for years ; And every little absence is an age. Pope. Dryden : Amphytrion. As some sad turtle his lost love deplores, Thus far from Delia to the winds I mourn, Alike unheard, unpitied, and forlorn. His friends beheld, and pity'd him in vain, For what advice can ease a lover's pain ? Absence, the best expedient they could find, Might save the fortune, if not cure the mind. Pope.

O thou that dost inhabit in my breast, Leave not the mansion so long tenantless; Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall, And leave no memory of what it was !

Impartial Proserpine beholds the truth ; And laughing at so vain and fond a task, Will strip thy hoary noddle of its mask. But autumn makes them ripe, and fit for use : So age a mature mellowness doth set On the green promises of youthful heat. Sir J. Denham. Addison. Age, like ripe apples, on earth's bosom drops ; While force our youth, like fruits, untimely We'll mutually forget The warmth of youth and frowardness of age. crops. Sir J. Denham. Addison. Young men soon give, and soon forget affronts ; Old age is slow in both. To elder years to be discreet and grave, Then to old age maturity she gave. Addison : Cato. Sir J. Denham.

Who this observes, may in his body find Decrepit age, but never in his mind. Sir J. Denham. Broome. Of Age's avarice I cannot see YV hat colour, ground, or reason there can be ; Is it not folly, when the way we ride Is short, for a long journey to provide ?

Before the Chastener humbly let me bow O'er hearts divided, and o'er hopes destroy'd. Not from grey hairs authority doth flow, Nor from bald heads, nor from a wrinkled brow ; But our past life, when virtuously spent, Must to our age those happy fruits present. Byron : Childe Harold. 'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, And coming events cast their shadows before. Sir J. Denham. Campbell : Lochiel's Warning. Age is froward, uneasy, scrutinous, Hard to be pleased, and parsimonious. Nor can the snow that age does shed Upon thy rev'rend head, Sir J. Denham. Quench or allay the noble fire within ; But all that youth can be thou art. Authority kept up, old age secures, Whose dignity as long as life endures. Cowley. Sir J. Denham. Now then the ills of age, its pains, its care, The drooping spirit for its fate prepare; And each affection failing, leaves the heart Loosed from life's charm, and willing to depart. Old husbandmen I at Sabinum know, Who for another year dig, plough, and sow ; For never any man was yet so old, Crabbe. But hoped his life one winter more would hold. Sir J. Denham. Our nature here is not unlike our wine ; Some sorts, when old, continue brisk and fine : So age's gravity may seem severe, Age by degrees invisibly doth creep, Nor do we seem to die, but fall asleep. But nothing harsh or bitter ought t' appear. Sir J. Denham. Sir J. Denham. Old age, with silent pace, comes creeping on, Nauseates the praise which in her youth she won, And hates the muse by which she was undone. Those trifles wherein children take delight Grow nauseous to the young man's appetite, And from those gaieties our youth requires To exercise their minds, our age retires. Dryden. Sir J. Denham. Thus daily changing, by degrees I'd waste, Still quitting ground by unperceived decay, And steal myself from life, and melt away.

On the cold pavement down I fell entranced, And so unfinish'd left the horrid scene ! Thomson. Dryden. FEAR. Fear freezes minds; but love, like heat, Exhales the soul sublime to seek her native seat. Here shame dissuades him, there his fear prevails ; Dryden. And each, by turns, his aching heart assails. Addison. While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear. I laugh to think how your unshaken Cato Will look aghast, while unforeseen destruction Pours in upon him thus from ev'ry side. Dryden. His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear, His high-designing thoughts were figured there. Addison. Dryden. Speechless with wonder, and half dead with fear. Addison. The more I know, the more my fears augment ; And fears are oft prophetic of th' event. Fear is an ague that forsakes And haunts by fits those whom it takes ; And they opine they feel the pain And blows they felt to-day, again. Dryden. Let him in arms the pow'r of Turnus prove, And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. Butler : Hudibras. Dryden. His fear was greater than his haste ; For fear, though fleeter than the wind, Believes 'tis always left behind. Aghast he waked ; and, starting from his bed, Cold sweat in clammy drops his limbs o'er- spread. BUTLER: Hudibras. Dryden. Men as resolute appear With too much as too little fear; As one condemn'd to leap a precipice, Who sees before his eyes the depth below, Stops short, and looks about for some kind And when they're out of hopes of flying, Will run away from death by dying ; Or turn again to stand it out, shrub And those they fled, like lions, rout. To break his dreadful fall. Dryden. Butler : ILudibras. Like one, that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, Th' advice was true; but fear had seized the man, And all good counsel is on cowards lost. And, having once turn'd round, walks on, And turns no more his head, Dryden. Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. I feel my sinews slacken'd with the fright, And a cold sweat thrills down all o'er my limbs, As if I were dissolving into water. Coleridge : Ancient Mariner. The absent danger greater still appears ; Less fears he who is near the thing he fears. Dryden. Fear never yet a gen'rous mind did gain; We yield on parley, but are storm'd in vain; Constraint, in all things, makes the pleasure less ; Sweet is the love which comes with willingness.

May make one music as before. Tennyson : Ln Memoriam. With empty labour and eluded strife, Seeking by knowledge to attain to life. O fertile head, which ev'ry year Could such a crop of wonders bear ! Which, might it never have been cast, Each year's growth added to the last, The lofty branches had supplied The earth's bold sons prodigious pride. Prior. Knowledge, when wisdom is too weak to guide her, Is like a headstrong horse that throws the rider. Quarles. Waller. LABOUR. The field To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed, Though after sleepless night. From labour health, from health contentment spring ; Milton. Contentment opes the source of every joy. God hath set Beattie : Minstrel. Labour and rest, as day and night, to men, Successive. Come, my fair love ! our morning's task we lose : Some labour e'en the easiest life would choose : Ours is not great; the dangling boughs to crop, Whose too luxuriant growth our alleys stop. Milton. Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his dignity; While other animals unactive range, And of their doings God takes no account. Dryden. With listed arms they order every blow, And chime their sounding hammers in a row ; With labour'd anvils .Etna groans below. Milton. Not so strictly hath our Lord imposed Labour, as to debar us when we need Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, Food of the mind. Dryden. If little labour, little are our gains : Man's fortunes are according to his pains. Herrick. Milton. Let us, then, be up and doing, With a heart for any fate ; Great things of small One can create, and, in what place soe'er, Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain, Through labour and endurance.

Reason was given to curb our headstrong will, And yet but shows a weak physician's skill ; Gives nothing while the raging fit doth last, But stays to cure it when the worst is past.

Dryden. I come to calm thy turbulence of mind, If reason will resume her sov'reign sway. DRY'DEN. Pope. Let reason then at her own quarry fly ; But how can finite grasp infinity ?

Afflicted sense thou kindly dost set free, Oppress'd with argumental tyranny; And routed reason finds a safe retreat in thee. DRY'DEN. Pope. Then thy straight rule set virtue in my sight, The crooked line reforming by the right ; My reason took the bent of thy command, Was form'd and polish'd by thy skilful hand.

Sweet spring ! full of sweet days and roses ; A box where sweets compacted lie ; In deference to his virtues, I forbear To show you what the rest in orders were; This brilliant is so spotless and so bright, He needs not foil, but shines by his own proper Thy music shows ye have your closes ; And all must die. light. Only a sweet and virtuous soul, Like season'd timber, never gives Dryden. But, though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives. George Herbert. The path to peace is virtue : what I show, Thyself may freely on thyself bestow : Fortune was never worshipp'd by the wise, But, set aloft by fools, usurps the skies. Each must in virtue strive for to excel ; Dryden. The man lives twice who lives the first life well. He whose mind Herrick. Is virtuous, is alone of noble kind ; Though poor in fortune, of celestial race ; And he commits the crime who calls him base.

The stars may from their orbits bend, The mountains rock, the heavens rend, The sun's last ember cool and quiver, \u2014 But virtue still shall glow forever ! Dryden. Fair virtue, should I follow thee, I should be naked and alone; For thou art not in company, And scarce art to be found in one. EVELY'N.

Fools into the notion fall That vice or virtue there is none at all : Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain ; 'Tis to mistake them costs the time and pain Virtue could see to do what virtue would By her own radiant light, though sun and moon Were in the flat sea sunk.

With him wheresoe'er he wanders, Wheresoe'er his feet abide. Pope. One to warn him when he darkleth, And rebuke him if he stray, Thus nature gives us, let it check our pride, The virtue nearest to our vice allied : Reason the bias turns to good or ill. One to leave him to his nature, And so let him go his way. Pope.

Who charm the sense, or mend the heart ; Who lead fair virtue's train along, One, the Teacher and Reprover, Marks each heaven-deserving deed, Moral truth, and mystic song. Pope.

Pope. When other things had pass'd away ; It had no meaning more than all Which in an idle hour fall ; I have known a word more gentle Than the breath of summer air ; In a listening heart it nestled, And it lived forever there.

Words are mighty, words are living: Serpents with their venomous stings, Or bright angels, crowding round us With heaven's light upon their wings ; So deeply fix'd as that one word.

Now past for me are April's madding hours, Whose freshness feeds the vanity of youth ; A spring so utterly devoid of truth, And should my youth, as youth is apt, I know, Some harshness show, Whose fruit is error, and deceit whose flowers. Gone, too, for me, is summer's sultry time, AU vain asperities I day by day Would wear away, When idly, reasonless, I sow'd these seeds, Till the smooth temper of my age should be Like the high leaves upon the holly-tree. Yielding to manhood charms, now proving weeds, And as when all the summer trees are seen So bright and green, With gaudy colours, poisoning as they climb. And well I fancy that they both are flown, The holly leaves a sober hue display Less bright than they ; And that beyond their tyrant reach I'm placed : But when the bare and wintiy woods we see, What then so cheerful as the holly-tree?
