' To genealogists themselves such a register can need no commendation \u2014 giving, as it does, the parentage, birthplace, and age at admission of every Oxford man ; it will be for them a priceless possession. We can only hope that they will show their gratitude by extending a liberal support to its enterprising editor.' \u2014 Athen\u00e6um. ' A most valuable addition to our sources of genealogical and biographical information. . . . Clearly primed tnd well got up, its accuracy will be taken for granted by all who know the character of Mr. Foster's earlier publica tions.' \u2014 Saturday Review. ' A boon to the nonplussed genealogist. ... A handy book of reference of perpetual use. . . . Everything is ready at hand, complete, concise, authentic. . . . The wonder is how, with the immense mass of matter, with unexceptional paper and print, the volume can be issued at the price.' \u2014 The Tablet ' To every member of either University, to every genealogist, and to all engaged in historical or biographical pursuits, the mere title of the work involves its full recommendation, and tells how formidable a labour Mr. Forster has undertaken. . . . Mr. Forster's spirited efforts will win him grateful recognition, and we are anxious to give a task such as he now undertakes all the publicity in our power.' \u2014 Notes and Queries. ' Upon the extraordinary value of this great undertaking for biographical and genealogical purposes it is unnecessary to dwell. We must content ourselves with calling attention to the rapidity with which it has been passed through the press, and to the low price at which it is issued \u2014 one guinea a volume.' \u2014 Academy. ' Mr. Foster has produced a book which reflects high credit upon his industry and perseverance.' \u2014 Morning Post. ' Of very great interest to the present generation, who will find the names of their friends on almost every page. . . . There is plenty of scope for cross-references and additional annotations. ' \u2014 The Church Times. ' The work will prove a most useful and invaluable one for reference.' \u2014 Ecclesiastical Gazette. ' The first volume of Mr. Joseph Foster's book, \"Alumni Oxoniensis,\" issued this week, is one of those works which, even in their incomplete form, inspire with unbounded respect the most casual examiner of their pages. Of its extreme value there can be no possible doubt, and genealogists will not be the only class to regard Mr. Foster as one of their greatest benefactors. . . The information supplied is for the most part absolutely correct.'
