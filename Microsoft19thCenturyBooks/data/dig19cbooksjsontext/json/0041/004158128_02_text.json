When the Proprietor first announced his intention of printing by subscrip tion a History, Gazetteer and Directory of the County of Derby, his views did not extend themselves beyond the getting together materials easily attainable, and to the arrangement of such materials so as to comprise an Alphabetical Account of Towns, Villages, &c. with their Inhabitants, in an octavo volume of about four hundred pages. He soon discovered that such a Publication would not be conformable to the ideas of the Nobility and Gentry, to whom he had the honour of presenting his Prospectus, who condescended, incidentally, to converse with him on the subject ; he consequently extended his design, and in doing so, every encouragement that he could expect or desire was freely bestowed upon him. Drawings and engravings of the resi dences belonging to the most respectable families in the County have been prepared for the Work at the expense of their Proprietors, who have likewise presented him with Armorial Bearings and authenticated copies of Pedigrees at their own cost, and by the loan of valuable Works and Manuscripts have afforded him other testimonies of the favour with which they regarded his undertaking. Still the change of plan, and the at . emulation of so much new and valuable matter, in which selection, condensation and arrangement, were necessary, demanded an expenditure of time and attention, which in the out-"], [12, "PREFACE. line of the first Prospectus had not been taken into consideration ; and, as the Alphabetical form of a Gazetteer was still regarded as the most eligible, it has happened that plates and other matter belonging to the latter portion of the Work were ready before the materials for the preceding portions could be obtained and made ready for the hands of the printer. The difficulties arising from such circumstances will, it is hoped, be admitted by all persons conversant in similar compilations, and the Proprietor and Editor have only to regret, that the whole or the greater part of the materials were not obtained and set in order before a Prospectus was issued, or a sheet sent to the press ; but that would indeed have beo-. arcely possible, f new matter is continually flowing from different quarters to a Topographical Work known to be in progress, and the Proprietor has already incurred a very large expense, and sometimes retarded the Work, by cancelling sheets that had passed the press, in order to give insertion to the communications of respected correspondents. With great labour and much trouble, and at an expense far beyond any ever contemplated, the History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby may be considered to have surmounted all impediments that might occasion further delay, and the Proprietor can confidently assure the Subscribers and the Public, that the two other Parts will speedily follow the present Publication."], [13, "CONTENTS TO PART I.\u2014 VOLUME II. \u25a0**\u00ab**\u2666' Page Ashbourn, almshouses . . 39 Page Page Barlow, Great, manor and church 94 Abney, village and manor 1 i hall . . . 42 Alder wasley, village charities . 95 manor and chapel . 2 pedigree of Hurt . 5 Aldwark, village, manor and grange .... 6 pedigree of Boothby . 43 pedigree of Beresford 46 pedigree of Dale . 53 Ashford in the Water, village and manor . . 55 Barlow, Little, village . . 95 Barrow, village . . .95 manor and church . 96 charities . . .97 Alfreton, a market-town . . 7 manor ... 8 pedigree of Beaumont . 97 family of Beaumont . 99 Barton Blount, village and manor 100 church . . 101 church and charities 56 Ashleyhay, village . .57 Ashopton inn . . .57 Ashover, village . . .57 workhouse . . 58 Gregory mine and manor 59 Overton . . 60 church . . .61 monuments . . 62 charities . .63 Overton hall, pedigrees of Bourne and Milnes 64 Aston, village . . .65 manor . . .66 church and charities . 67 church . . .11 charities . . .12 pedigree of Turner . 13 notice of the family of Wood . . 13 pedigree of Brad- shaw . 101 Barton hall . 102 hall . . . .13 Barwardcote, village and manor . 102 Baslow, village and townships . 103 manor, church and chari- pedigree of Morewood . 14 hall ... 15 Alkmanton, village . .15 manor . .16 ties . . . 104 Beard, Olierset, Whittle and Thornset . . .10* hospital . .16 Allestree, village . . .16 Beauchief, village and abbey . 106 hall . . 107 church . . .17 charities . .18 pedigree of Stead and Strelley . . 109 Beeley, village and manor . 110 chapel and charities .

At the Doomsday Survey this manor belonged to William Peverel ; in the reign of Edward II. to the family of Archer; at a later period to a branch of the Bagshaw family, who sold it to the Bradshaws, in which family it remained nearly two centuries, when it passed by marriage to the Galliards of Edmonton, in Middlesex ; the sister and co-heiress of the latter brought it to the late Charles Bowles, esq. of Sheen, in Surrey, and it is now the property of his son, Humphrey Bowles, esq.

Allerwaslegh, Allenvash, N. of Derby, is a scattered village, township and chapelry, in the parish of Wirksworth, deanery of Ashbourn and hundred of Appletree, containing 80 houses, 80 fami lies, and 454 inhabitants. Sixty-two families are employed in agriculture, 17 in trade, and one independent. There is an iron forge, conducted by Messrs Mold and Co. and a corn mill. There are 3024 acres of gritstone land in this township, of various qualities, 7^0 acres of which is wood land. The average rental is about 1 7*. per acre, and the estimated annual value of the buildings and land amount to \u00a32775. 11s. There are five freeholders who own about 237 acres, the re mainder is the property of Francis Hurt, esq. The tithes belong to the dean of Lincoln, who has leased them to G. H. Errington, esq. the latter gentleman re-lets them to Mr. Hurt. The Vol. II. b"], [18, "2 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER average poor rates and other parochial expenses for the last nine years are \u00a3239. 19s- 10d. per annum. Mr. Hurt holds a court annually. The steward of the court is James Milnes, esq. of Matlock. A decree in chancery was obtained, 19 Elizabeth, by William Blackwall, of Steeple, county of Derby, gent. John Storer, and Richard Wingfield, of Alderwasley, copyholders of the manor, for themselves and others, against Edward Lowe, esq. In consequence of which decree, the lords of this manor are not entitled to heriots, nor more than one year's improved rent on ad mittance of a customary tenant by descent or purchase. There are two Sunday schools ; one is supported by Mrs. Hurt, the other by Miss Watkinson, of the Forge. The Wesleyan Methodists have a chapel here. Alderwasley and Ashleyhay form a joint constablery. From Alport hill and Alport stone, near the village of Spout, it is said the Wrekin in Shropshire may be seen on a clear day. \" Though Alderwasley is parcel of the hundred of Appletree, yet it is within the parish of Wirksworth, the site of which is in the hundred of Wirksworth. The name is compounded of Alder (the Alnus or Alder tree) wash (a watering place) and ley (a pasture). Its situation is in the northern angle of the hundred. Alderwasley, Milnehay and the whole of Ashleyhay (except ing two farms in Ashleyhay, the property of P. Gell, esq.) form one manor, and are bounded by the lordships of Crich and Belper on the east ; by the lordships of Belper and Shottle on the south : by Alton on the west; and by Wigwell grange and Wirksworth on the north. \" Alderwasley is not mentioned in Doomsday Book; being probably at the time when that record was compiled, accounted part of Belper, a dependent manor of the great fee of Duffield. William de Ferrers, earl of Ferrers and Derby, and lord of the castle and manor of Duffield, had a charter of free warren in his demesne lands here, in the 36th year of king Henry III. The estates of the family of Ferrers passed to the house of Lancaster under circumstances which will be fully spoken of in the history of Duffield. By the extent taken of the lands which were of Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, the king's brother, in anno 26 Edward I. it is found that he had in Alerwash \u00a320. 7s- 6^d. per annum of rents of assize, of free and other tenants at will and by the custom ; and there was also a certain mill of which the lord received annually 60_. : he had also other revenues, the description of which is obliterated in the record, worth one year with another \u00a315. ; tallage of his customary tenants to the amount of 60s. per annum ; ancient fines at his two great courts amounting to 10.. per annum ; and pleas and perquisites of courts, worth per annum 20.. And the same year Allerwaslegh, as a member of Duffield, was assigned to Blanche, queen of Navarre, widow of Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, in dower. The manor continued parcel of the possessions ofthe earldom and duchy of Lancaster to the time of king Henry the VIII. who (20.h March, anno reg. sui 1 9) granted it with all his lands, tenements, rents, reversions and services in Alderwasley and Ashleyhay, parcel of his duchy of Lancaster, to Anthony Lowe, esq. and his heirs, to hold by the yearly rent of \u00a326. 10.. and fealty only for all services. Out of this grant arose a noted cause which was argued in the court of Wards, Trin. term, 7 lac. I.' and which is reported, by Sir Edward Coke, under the title of 'Anthony Lowe's Case.' Anthony Lowe, be fore the grant above mentioned, held lands in Alderwasley, of the manor of Alderwasley, by knights' service, and suit to the court of the manor of Bewraper (Belper) from three weeks to three weeks, of which manor of Bewraper the manor of Alderwasley was parcel ; and the whole being parcel of the earldom and duchy of Lancaster, and being, before the manors came to the crown, held of the king in capite by knights' service. Lowe held also of the manor of Alderwas ley a capital messuage, &c. &c. in soccage, by fealty and the rent of \u00a33. 11*. And Lowe being so seised, the king, by his letters patent under the duchy seal, 22nd June, 15 Henry VIII. granted to Anthony Lowe (ancestor of Anthony Lowe, the plaintiff) and to his heirs the said rent, and ratified the estate of the said Anthony in the lands and tenements before mentioned, to hold to Anthony and his heirs, of the king, his heirs and successors by fealty for all services. And after this grant, the king made the grant to Lowe of the manor as is before stated. Upon which this question was raised, Whether the lands first held by Lowe, of the manor of Alderwasley by knights' service, were, after the grant of the manor to Lowe, to be held by him of the king in capite by knights' service, or by fealty. And it was determined that they should from thenceforth"], [19, "t OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 3 be held by fealty. This cause was learnedly argued ; but as what was offered upon it would only be attended to by few readers of this work, and those probably such as are possessed of the reports of the celebrated lawyer whose authority I have cited, it would be superfluous to say more upon it here. After this, upon a contest between the king jXharles I.] and Edward Lowe, esq. (great grandson of the first Anthony) in the chancery of the duchy of Lancaster, it appearing that there was a defect in the making of livery and seisin upon the grant of king Henry VIII. of the manor and lands of Alderwasley and Ashleyhay to Anthony Lowe, and that the letters patent granting the same were thereby void, the king, after humble supplication, by his letters patent, under the great seal of England and under the seal ofthe duchy, dated 14th of April, anno regni sui 16 [[Charles I.]] granted to the before named Edward, his heirs and assigns the manor of Al derwasley, alias Allerwasleghe, with court leet, view of frank pledge, assize and assay of bread, wine and beer, goods and chattels of felons and fugitives, and other franchises, as amply as they were enjoyed by any Earl or Duke of Lancaster owning the said manor : to hold of the king in soccage, as of his manor of Enfield, in Middlesex, by the annual rent of \u00a326. 10_. From which time the manor hath continued with the grantee and his descendants, and Francis Hurt, esq. is now the owner thereof. \" But the present lord of the manor has here an estate which has been in his family from an earlier period than the manor, derived from his ancestors of the name le Fowne or Fawne, one of whom, William, son of Ralph le Fowne, about the time of Henry III. was a benefactor to the canons of Darley. \" Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, on the 2nd of December, 13 Edward I. granted to William, son of William Fawne \"\"[William le Fowne] and his heirs, a parcel of land in Alderwasley, where the earl's chamber used to be ; and a parcel of land lying between Lowdbrooke and Millbrooke; to hold by the yearly rent of 12c.. and charged with the duty of sustaining the pales between Lowd brooke and Millbrooke by the view ofthe earl's foresters. The earl's chamber it is probable was a seat used by the lords of Duffield) when they took the diversion of hunting in this part of the forest of Duffield frith; and I should presume it stood on the site of the present manor-house. This grant is said to comprise (inter alia) what is now called the Shyning Cliff park, which, in 2 Henry V. the homagers of the manor presented to be held by John Fawne as a frank tenant. And in 7 Henry V. John Fawne enfcoffed Ralph, son of Peter de la Pole, in the Shyning Cliff, who granted it to John Sacheverell, esq. for life, with remainder to Thomas Fawne, son of John, and his heirs. The male line of the family of Fawne continued here till the reign of Edward IV. and then terminated with the death of Thomas Fawne, who was in some way employed in the service of Henry Stafford, the great Duke of Buckingham. Joan, his daughter and heiress, was designed, in 29 Henry VI. to have been married to Thomas Handford, son of William Handford, of Chorley, in Cheshire, esq. In prospect of which marriage, Henry Lord Grey and other feoffees then granted to Thomas Handford and Joan Fawne all the lands of John Fawne, her grandfather, in Alderwasley and Ashleyhay, in Derbyshire : Alcester and Ordesley, in Warwick shire, and elsewhere in those counties : to hold to them and the heirs of their bodies, with re mainder to Thomas Fawne, her father, and his heirs. But this marriage did not take effect [[Handford dyings for on the 20th of November, 11 Edward IV. she ' in pura virginitate sua et plena \u00e6tate existens viz vigenti et trium annorum,' grants to William Sacheverell and Richard Cadman and their heirs the same estates, and these feoffees, on the 24th of the same month, granted them to Thomas Lowe, and the before mentioned Joan, in settlement. \"On the 20th of November, in the sixth year of Henry VIII. the king granted to Thomas Lowe, whom he styles his servant, license to impark and impale Shyning Cliff, and to make a free warren thereof, notwithstanding its being within the metes of the forest of Duffield frith. An thony Lowe, the third son and heir of Thomas and Joan, was a servant of king Henry VII. He was also standard-bearer and a gentleman ofthe bed chamber to king Henry VIII. who 22nd of June, anno 15 Henry VIII. appointed him an hereditary forester of Duffield frith; and, in con sequence of his having received a wound in his head in the loyal service, the king indulged him with the privilege of being covered in his presence. p6th August, 23 Henry VIII.

Bridget, his wife, was daughter of Sir John Fogge, comptroller of the household, and privy counsellor to Henry VII. and was herself maid of honour to queen Catharine. [[Easter term, 1 Elizabeth, Edward Lowe, esq. levies a fine of 27 messuages, 3 water-mills, 300 acres of land, 300 acres of pasture, 300 acres of meadow, 1000 acres of wood, and 400 acres of furze and heath, in Alderwasleigh, Ashleyheigh and Wirksworth.] Anthony Lowe, their grandson, died the 23rd of June, 42 Eliz- abeth, seised of the manor of Alderwasley, and of 27 messuages, 5 cottages, 2 water-mills, 300 acres of land, 300 acres of meadow, 300 acres of pasture, 1000 acres of wood, and 400 acres of furze and heath, in Alderwasley, leaving Edward Lowe, esq. his son and heir eight years of age. This Edward, in the troubles between Charles I. and his parliament, was a supporter ofthe royal cause, and raised a troop of horse for the king, in which all his sons served ; and the eldest of them [[Anthony] having the command of it, lost his life in the service, at Gainsborough, on the 30th of July, 1643, with Charles Cavendish (the Duke of Newcastle's lieut.-general of horse) and was buried with him at Bolsover. We are not to be surprised that the part taken by this family brought upon it the displeasure of the parliament party ; and the latter being generally success ful in Derbyshire, almost from the commencement of the troubles, made the Lowes feel the weight of its resentment. \" Mr. Edward Lowe was soon driven to seek relief from the king, whose cause he had endea- voured to assist ; and he petitioned his majesty to punish his enemies by a sequestration of their estates and lands : a request which those who are acquainted with the history of the times, need not be informed was fruitless. Though, had it been in the power of the king to punish the injuries complained of, there is little reason to doubt of his inclination. Edward Lowe, of Alder- wasley, esq. and his sons, John and Arthur, after these troubles, compounded with the parlia- ment for their estates by the payment of \u00a3221. \"John Lowe, esq. grandson of Edward, was sheriff of Derbyshire in 1679, and died without issue. Elizabeth, his sister and heir, carried this manor and the other estates of the family in marriage to Nicholas Hurt, of Casterne, in Staffordshire, esq. whose son, Charles Hurt, esq. was sheriff of Derbyshire in 1714, as was Nicholas Hurt, esq. son of Charles, in 1756; and Francis Hurt, esq. (son of Francis) (and Nephew of the last Nicholas) in 1778, whilst his father was living; which Francis, the son, was (February 1797) owner of this manor, and a considerable estate, viz. 3149 acres therein, partly derived from his ancestors, the Fawnes and Lowes, and partly from the purchase of his father and others of his family from Nathaniel Lord Scarsdale, and others at different periods. But that which was sold by Lord Scarsdale [[A. D. 1776] had before belonged to the family of Lowe, and was given to a younger son as his portion. \" Alderwasley, Milnehay, and Ashleyhay contain together nearly 44Q0 acres of land, in which on the east side of the manor, adjoining the river Derwent, is an extensive wood, called Shyning Cliff, producing very valuable oak timber. This wood has nearly a similar situation to that at Richmond, m Surrey, formerly called West Sheene, which perhaps may explain the origin ofthe name ; Sheene, signifying, glittering or showy, which well agrees with the brilliant picture formed by these woods on the bosom of the river. In the division of the remainder ofthe manor into arable, meadow and pasture, the greatest proportion of arable is on the western part in Ashlev hay, where the soil is a stiff cold clay. The richest part of the meadow is towards the east near the river Derwent; but the quantity of meadow is small compared with the extent of the'lord ship The pasture land is for the most part light and sandy, and is in an elevated and bleak situating and though the whole of the pasture be enclosed, there is much of it yet remains un The hall is a handsome and substantial built stone mansion, situate on rising ground on the west bank of the river Derwent, surrounded by hanging woods that crown the neighbouring * Blore's published Sheet of Alderwasley, 1797."], [21, "5 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. hills. This house has been much enlarged and improved by the present occupier. A deer park and rich lawn, adorned with venerable oaks, spread before the mansion and affords many beauti ful landscapes. The gardens are well stored with excellent vineries, pineries, &c. The timber on this estate is considered equal to any in the kingdom ; and trees of great magnitude have been felled. For many years past Mr. Hurt has regularly cut down timber producing a consider able annual revenue: The chapel is situate near the hall, and was built in the reign of Henry VIII. by the contribu tion of Thomas Lowe, esq. and other principal inhabitants. It is not subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and has no parochial duties performed in it, nor any endowment. The minister is paid an optional salary by Mr. Hurt, who has the appointment.

At the' visitation ordered by the Herald's Office, in the reign of Elizabeth, A. D. 156*9, and taken by the commissioners, Flower and Glover, we find that the Pedigree of the Hurt family, then of Ashbourn, viz. four generations, was entered by Thomas Hurt, gent, of that place. This family then appear to have ranked among the chief gentry of Derbyshire, and have ever since continued to do so. The elder branch was long seated at Ashbourn. It terminated about the close of the seventeenth century by the marriage of the heiress with a Byrom. The younger branches have greatly increased their wealth and alliances by marriage in families of rank and opulence. The present Francis Hurt, esq. of Alderwasley, and his ancestors during several gen erations, for about one hundred and eighty years, have been resident on that manor. This gen tleman waS high-sheriff in 1814, and several of his predecessors have enjoyed that honourable office. Francis Hurt, esq. is an active Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieut, of the County, and much respected by his tenantry and the poor resident on his estates. ALDWARK, a village, constablery and township in the parish of Bradbourn, and hundred of Wirksworth, contains 15 houses, 15 families, and 92 inhabitants. Eleven families are employed in agricultuse, and four in mining and trade. There are acres of limestone land, the esti mated annual value of which, including the buildings, is \u00a3724- 14.. The poor rates are about the same as those of Bradbourn, to which church it pays. The great tithes belong to the Duke of Rutland. The manor was given by Sewall, son of Fulcher, ancestor of the Shirley family, who died 1 129, to the monks of Darley. They had temp. Henry IV. five ox-gangs of land, and three acres of meadow here. Queen Elizabeth granted it to James Hardwick, esq. and his heiress"], [23, "7 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. brought it to Sir William Cavendish, ancestor of the Duke of Devonshire, who has exchanged this estate with the Duke of Rutland, now the sole proprietor. His Grace's rental is about \u00a3900. per annum. Aldwark Grange, which had also belonged to the monks of Darley, was granted by Edward VI. in 1548, to Sir Thomas Heneage and Lord Willoughby, who sold it the following year to Robert Goz : by successive conveyances it passed to the families of Curzon and Manners. John Manners, esq. procured a fresh grant of it in 1603 ; and it is now the property of his descendant, the Duke of Rutland. Robert Earl Ferrers, founded an oratory at Aldwark, with a cemetery, of which there is now no trace. Besides the Duke there are three other freeholders in this parish. ALFRETON, an ancient market-town, township and parish, is pleasantly seated on the ridge \u00c6lfredingtune, 0f a \\i\\\\\\t eastward of the valley through which flows the river Amber. This ' hill extends, with an easy acclivity, for the space of two miles, where, near to the village of Normanton, it affords a wide and beautiful prospect, and then descends into the fer tile tract of land called Golden Valley. It is in the deanery of Chesterfield and hundred of Scars dale ; 14 m. N. of Derby, 10 m. N. E. of Wirksworth, 10 m. S. of Chesterfield, 16 m. N. W. of Nottingham, 9 m. S. W. of Mansfield, and 140 m. N. of London. The market which, is a con siderable one for corn, is held on Friday, and the fairs on the 31st of July, 8th of October, and 2 3rd of November. The whole parish, including the hamlets of Greenhill Lane,* Somercotes, Over and Nether Birchwood, Cotes-Park, Out-seats, Pyebridge and Swanwiek, and the chapelry of Riddings, contained, in 1821, 811 houses, 891 families, 2515 males, 2174 females, total 4689 inhabitants. Ofthe 891 families 159 are employed in agriculture, 679 in trade or handicraft, and 53 in professional pursuits or living independent of business. The principal trade consists in collieries, iron furnaces, framework knitting, potteries, &c. In 1821, the whole population ofthe parish of Alfreton were found to consist of 4689 persons, of whom 1629 were in the township of Alfreton, 1295 in Swanwiek and Greenhill Lane, and 1765 in Riddings, Somercotes and Birchwood. The increase in the district of Riddings, in eight years, is about 750 ; Swanwiek and Greenhill, upwards of 300 ; and Alfreton, only 50 : the population at the present time is about 6000 persons. The extension of the collieries and iron works in the eastern part of the parish, accounts for the rapid increase of the population in that district. This parish is governed by a constable and headborough. The collieries of Alfreton, have for many years been one Of the principal sources of employ ment to its inhabitants. So early as the reign of Edward II. (about 1315) we find that Thomas de Chaworth made a grant to the monks of Beauchief to supply themselves with coal got in this liberty.t In the reign of James I. John Zouch, esq. had acquired by his own purchase and that ofthe preceding Lords ofthe manor, the greater part of the coals in the parish. From which it appears that the collieries were at that time thought of considerable importance : and it is evident that the succeeding proprietors have continued to work them, to a greater or less extent, ever since. The Somercotes, Birchwood, and Swanwiek coals are in high repute. The coal got here resembles what is called rock coal by Mr. White Watson in his Strata of Derbyshire. It is of a solid, compact texture; breaks with difficulty; and presents in its fracture a surface, not like the coals at the Stavely and Chesterfield delphs, splintery and laminated : but dull and obtuse, almost like the fracture of an argillaceous grit. It takes fire with difficulty, burns with a strong and regular heat and lasts a considerable time, being nearly free from sulphur, it mostly gives a white or grey coloured ashes. The manufacture of earthenware was introduced into this neighbourhood at an early period. The pottery was established at Morewood moor, near Alfreton, at the beginning ofthe 17th cen tury, where a family of the name of Dodd, for some generations conducted the works. From the Morewood potteries, two brothers of the name of Elers, are said to have gone into Stafford- \" An urn containing nearly 700 Roman coins was found at this place by a labouring man about 80 years ago. \u25a0f- Charter of Edward II.

Between seventy and eighty years ago, a pottery was introduced into Alfreton, by George Bacon, and was conducted after his death by his nephew and grand nephew, but it is now disused. Bacon was opposed by a man who had worked under him, named Smith, and the pottery esta blished by Smith is still managed by his descendants. The iron furnaces were established by a company of gentlemen about 20 years ago.\u2014 These we have noticed in the chapter on the Commerce ofthe county, in Vol. I. The whole township contains 4570 acres of freehold land, of a cold wet quality, abounding with coal and ironstone, tithe free, one third arable, some wood, and the remainder meadow and pas ture. This parish is bounded on the W. by South Winfield, on the N. and N. W. by Shirland and Normanton, on the E. by Pinxton and Snelston, Notts. and on the S. and S. E. by Pentrich and Heanor. The farms are generally small. The average parochial expenses, except highways and church rates, for the last seven years, amount to \u00a31200. per annum. The annual estimated value of all the buildings, lands, &c. is \u00a39634. 2*. There are 242 freeholders. The principal of whom are William Palmer Morewood, esq. owner of 1500 acres, Rev. John Wood 300 acres, James Oaks, esq. 162 acres, and several houses, Gabriel Britain, esq. 172 acres, Thomas Barker, of Bakewell, esq. 144 acres, John Cressy Hall, esq. 105 acres, Gervase Cressy Hall, esq. 31 acres, Joseph Wilson, esq. 42 acres, Sir John Eardley Wilmot, bart. 70 acres, John Blackwall, of Blackwall, esq. 48 acres, Executors of Samuel Dannah 74 acres, Messrs. Wright and Jessop 120 acres, Samuel and Christopher Martin 123 acres, Samuel, George and John Maltby 100 acres, Samuel Cutler 77 acres, Hough and others 74 acres, William and George Wilson 36 acres, Samuel Roberts 72 acres, the remainder 1250 acres is much divided. The average rental is about 28.s. per acre. There are 18 public houses, 3 county bridges, 2 Wesleyan Methodist, 2 Independent, and 1 Baptist chapels, 1 chapel of ease now building at Riddings, 1 parochial day school, 1 endowed free school, 2 Sunday schools, and 3 Friendly Societies consisting of about 450 members, in the parish. William Palmer Morewood, esq. is the lord of the manor, and holds a court annually. An excellent house of industry was built in 1801 about one mile south of the town. Mr. Higgott has been the governor ever since it was opened. The average number of inmates is about forty. The market at Alfreton was granted, in 1251, to Robert de Latham and Thomas de Chaworth, to be held on Monday, together with a fair for three days, at the festival of St.\" Margaret. This charter was renewed to Thomas Babington, of Dethicke, in 1551. In 1756* the market was changed from Monday to Friday, on which day it is now kept. There is a traditional account that this town was built by the renowned king Alfred, from whom it took its name ; and that the royal founder had a palace here. Some individuals, fond of making discoveries, are ingenious enough to point out the place where the palace of this monarch once stood. The site of the gallows and of a moot hall and prisons are also shown, but with no other proof of their existence than long tradition. In Ehlretune Morcar had four ox-gangs and a half, and four acres of land to be taxed for one manor. There is land to one plough. There are nine villanes and three bordars with two ploughs. There are five acres of meadow. It was formerly worth 20s. now 30s. Ingram holds it under Rnrrer de Busli. D. B. 325. The manor of Alfreton was given by Wulfric Spott, a noble Saxon, and confirmed by Ethelred II. to Burton abbey* In the Doomsday Survey it is called Elstretune, and made part of the \" Dugdale, describing the foundation of this abbey, says, In the days of Ethelred, king of the English, a minister of his, whose name was Wulfric Spott, who was related to the blood royal, built the monastery of Burton : and gave to it all his paternal estate, valued at 700 pounds of gold, and to the end this donation might stand good, he gave to the king for his confirmation 300 mancuses of gold, and to every bishop live mancuses, and to the archbishops ten mancuses ; as also to Alfrick, archbishop of Canterbury, the town of Dunbarton, wrongfully taken by his prede cessor from the church of Abingdon ; and to every abbey a pound of gold, and to every abbot five mancuses. He brought the monks from Winchester to their new monastery at Burton, which he furnished with all conveniences in 1004, and six years after he received a mortal contusion in the war against the Danes, of which he died in ltllO and was honorably buried under a stone arch by the gate of the abbey church."], [25, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 9 extensive possessions originally bestowed upon Roger de Busli, a Norman chieftain, who accom panied William the Conqueror in his successful expedition to this country. Ingram then held it, and was the immediate ancestor of Robert Fitz Ranulph, or Fitz Ralph, lord of Alfreton, the founder of Beauchief abbey, between the years 1172 and 1 176. It has been stated by Tanner, Dugdale and others, that this Fitz Ralph was one of the four knights who murdered Thomas a Becket, archbishop of Canterbury ; and he, in expiation of his crime, founded that abbey, which he endowed (9 Henry II.) with considerable property, besides the advowson of the churches of Alfreton and Norton, in the county of Derby, and Wimeswould and Edwalton, in the county of Nottingham. This statement Dr. Pegge endeavours to refute. His descendants, as was the cus tom of those times, were denominated de Alfreton. William, the son ofthe founder of Beauchief, succeeded to the estates in the reign of Richard I. whose sorTRobert,* dying in the reign of John, left issue one son, Thomas who was lord of Alfreton, Norton, &c. but he dying without issue in the reign of Henry III. this manor and the large estates of the family descended in 1269 to his two sisters, viz. Alice the wife of Sir William Chaworth,t knight, and Amicia or Joan the wife of Robert de Latham, descended from the Lathams of Lancashire, and who, as appears by the an cient exchequer record, had considerable property in Alfreton in the reign of Henry III. and held, according to the words of the record, \" de veteri Feoffamento,\" two parts of two fees there, under the Countess of Angus. ;f The interest of the latter being sold to Chaworth, the entire estate on his death descended to Sir Thomas Chaworth his son, in whose family and name the estate continued till the time of Henry VII. This Thomas, according to an inquisition taken 4 Edward I. claimed to have assize of bread and beer, in Alfreton, and had appropriated the right of free warren there and at Norton, &c. In 3 Henry III. he had a suit against the bishop of Lincoln. He was a great benefactor to Beauchief abbey or Abbey de Bello Capite. In 29 \u2022 Robert, son of Ranulph de Alfreton, by the consent of William, his heir, gave to God and the church of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert, at Radford, the church of Osberton, county Nottingham. The said William confirmed his father's gift, and so did Robert, son of William, the gift ofthe said Robert his grandfather. Thomas de Chaworth confirmed the said gift, and confirmations which his ancestors had made, together with the land which the said Robert, son of Wlliam de Auferton, grandfather 'of him, the said Thomas de Chaworth, quit claimed. f Robert de Chaurces, held a knights' fee in Marneham, which he had with the daughter of Ralph, son of William de Walichvill, temp. Henry II. excepting two carucates of land, whereof the king made his plea. This Robert, 14 Henry II. gave account of one mark for one fee of the aid of Maud, the king's daughter. King John confirmed to. Robert de Chaurces and his heirs, the manor of Marneham and Wadworth for one knights' fee, which were the inher- itance ofthe said Robert, and William his father, 14 Henry III. William de Chaurces acknowledged that he then owed to Alice, countess of Ewe, fifty-five marks of the fine made between them. The king, 28 Henry III. confirmed the gift and grant which Alice, countess of Ewe, made to Robert de Lexington, of the custody of the whole land which was William de Chaurces in Marneham, but it appears this William was then dead. He married one of the sisters and co-heirs of Thomas, son of Robert, Baron of Alfreton, by whom he left a son, Thomas de Chaurces, in minority, 2b\" Henry III. Robert de Latham married Joanne (whom other authors call Amicia) the other co-heiress, and gave a great fine for having the custody or wardship of Thomas de Chaurces, nephew, and one of the heirs of Thomas, son of Robert de Alfreton, until he should be of age, saving to the king all wards, escheats, manors, and advowson of churches, and the manors of other, the heirs of the said Thomas, if he should chance to die before he came of age. Thomas de Chaworth, 34 Henry III. had a suit against the bishop of Lincoln. Thomas de Chaworth, 41 Henry III. had mercat and fair granted at Marneham Chaworth, and free warren at Alfreton, Norton, &c. The first Robert de Chaurces held a knights' fee of William de Albeni, in Leicestershire, his grand child or brother, the second Robert, who married the great co-heir, kept not so true to the crown, but there is a note of his returning to his fidelity and the king's trust, temp.

It appears that the manor of Alfreton was formerly held, during the existence of military Ignores, of the honour of Tickhill in the duchy of Lancaster, by a certain service (as is expressed in the inquisition 29 Edward I.) from three weeks to three weeks. Thomas Chaworth was charged 17*. 9d. for a scrutage, 2 Edward I. In 12 Edward II. Thomas de Chaworth had settled Marneham by a fine on Thomas de Chaworth his son, and the heirs of his body, which he should beget on Joan his wife, &c. This Thomas the younger died before his father, and had a second wife named Margaret (after his death 47 Edward III. married to William de Spaigne, of Boston) by whom he had William, who was IS years old on the death of his grandfather, Sir Thomas, the elder, which happened about 42 Edward III. he being a very old man. Sir Thomas, the elder, claimed a park and right of free warren at Alfreton, with the privilege of having a gallows, tumbrel and pillory for the manor. Dr. Pegge says, that Alfreton was in ancient times esteemed a barony or honour. Dugdale says, William de Chaworth, grandson of the last possessor, married Alice the daughter and heir of John de Caltoft, knt. lord of East Bridgeford, county of Nottingham. The issue of this marriage was Sir Thomas Chaworth, knt. who succeeding his father, was, 2 Henry V. ( 1 4 1 3) as appears by the book of warrants in the Duchy Office, folio 114, possessed of the manors of Al freton and Norton. He married Isabella, one of the daughters and co-heirs of Sir Thomas Aylisbury, knt. (who was nearly related by marriage to the lords of Bassett, of Welldon, and to the ancestors ofthe celebrated Lord Bolingbroke.) He died, 1 0th Feb. 37 Henry VI. (1458) when he was found by Inquist. post mortem to be possessed of the manor of Alfreton, then worth with its appurtenances upwards of 40 marks a year, and ofthe manor of Riddings in the same parish, and of Norton and Williamthorpe, and other property in the county of Derby. William Cha worth, esq. was 28 years old at the time of his father's death, and the last of this branch of^the family, left Joan, an only daughter and heir in the reign of Henry VII. married to John Ormond, esq. who held the estate until his death, on 5th Oct. 1503, at which time the estate was said to be worth \u00a340. a year. Joan his wife survived him about four years. The heir-general of Ormond carried it in marriage to Thomas, son of Anthony Babington, of Dethicke, knt. which said Thomas died in 1561, possessed of the manor of Alfreton, and other property in Alfreton, Swanwiek, Somercotes and Riddings, and a moiety of the manor of Norton and lands there, and at Cold Aston. The manor of Alfreton was at this time held of the honour of Tickhill, by the service of the fourth part of a knights' fee and 6s. 8d. rent per annum, for the ward of the castle of Tickhill. In 1565, Henry Babington, esq. the son of Thomas, sold it and the advowson of the church, to Sir John Zouch, of Codnor castle, knt. who died 28 Elizabeth (1585) possessed ofthe manor of Alfreton, and considerable freehold estates in the parish. In 1618, John Zouch, esq. his son, conveyed the manor house, park and estate belonging to it, to Robert Sutton, esq. of Aram, in Nottinghamshire, by whom it was sold in 16*29 to Anthony Morewood, of Hemsworth, in the parish of Norton, in the county of Derby, gent, and Rowland his son and heir apparent ; and in that family it continued to the death of the last heir male, George Morewood, esq. in 1 792 : he married Ellen, the daughter of Richard Goodwin, esq. of Ashbourn, and dying without issue left the estate to his widow : she afterwards married the Rev. Henry Case ; who, in 1 793, on his marriage, took the name of Morewood, by the king's sign manual. The latter died in 1825 with out issue ; when the estate became the property of William Palmer, of Ladbrooke, county of Warwick, esq. nephew to the late Mrs. Morewood, who has also assumed the name of Morewood. Thomas Dynham, gent. 31 Henry VIII. claimed, against John Fitz William's widow, the third part of the manors of Alfreton and Norton, which continued long to the family of Chaworth, and of which Joan was in part heir."], [27, "11 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. The church is an ancient rude structure, with some handsome perpendicular windows, and pinnacled tower steeple at the west end embattled; the whole structure has evidently been built at several different times, with but little regularity of form. One of the lords of Alfreton was the builder of this church ; for it appears that in the ninth year of the reign of Henry II. Robert, the son of Ranulph, gave it to Beauchief abbey, of which he was the founder. In the second year of the reign of Edward VI. the king granted it to Thomas Babington, who had then become the proprietor of the manor. The church is dedicated to St. Mary. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at \u00a3l6. yearly tenths l6s. 10id. It has been augmented with a sum of \u00a3200. subscribed, and \u00a3200. obtained from queen Anne's bounty, and is now worth about \u00a3150. per annum. The rectory of Alfreton, with the advowson of the vicarage, was granted by Henry VIII. to Francis Leake, esq. whose descendant, Nicholas, Earl of Scarsdale, sold them, in 1 673, to John Turner, of Swanwiek, gent. The rectorial tithes were sold by auction, about the year 1779, chiefly to the several land owners, by the trustees of the late George Turner, esq. The advowson, of the vicarage was purchased by the late George Morewood, esq. and now belongs to William Palmer Morewood, esq. The present incumbent is the Rev. John Pepper. There was a chantry in the church of Alfreton, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The lands belonging to which, of the value of \u00a38. 4-s. 8d. per annum, were granted by Edward VI. to Thomas Babington.

From an early period the Morewoods ranked among the principal gentry of that district, of this and the neighbouring counties, which has obtained the name of Hallamshire. The Oaks in Bradfield was sold by John Morewood, son of Samuel, to Robert Newton, esq. of Norton. He died in 1771. at the advanced age of 83, and left a numerous progeny (Samuel and Rowland, with others) deprived of their landed possessions. The three daughters of the wealthy merchant, Gilbert, who died in 1650, enriched many illustrious families. Barbara, the wife of Thomas Rich, esq. afterwards Sir Thomas Rich, of Sunning ; Grace married Simon Bennet of Bechamp ton, esq. and her three daughters were married into the noble families of Osborne, Cecil and Bennet ; Frances became the wife of Sir Thomas Gresley, of Drakelow, bart. Anthony More wood was high-sheriff of the county of Derby, in l64_). He left two daughters, of whom the elder married the Hon. Alexander Stanhope, a younger son of the Earl of Chesterfield ; the younger, Henry Goreing, esq. Both died without issue, and the estate of Alfreton passed to John Morewood, whose grandson, George Morewood, esq. the last male heir of this branch ofthe family, left the estate to his wife, who survived him; she secondly married the Rev. Henry Case, rector of Ladbrooke, who assumed the name of Morewood : leaving no issue by either, she devi sed the estate to her nephew, William Palmer, esq. the son of her sister, who has also assumed the name of Morewood, as may be seen in the Pedigree. Four of this family have been high sheriffs ofthe county of Derby, viz. Anthony in 16\u00b19, John 1677, Rowland 1707, and George 1762. Rowland, who died in 1619, was a great benefactor to Alfreton and other places. As the ancient proprietors of this manor derived from it their title, we may reasonably suppose, from the customs of that age, that here was their fixed manorial residence. If, however, there was any building of that kind, it probably on coming into the hands of the Chaworths was ex changed for some other, and permitted to fall into ruins. The latter family it seems by the In quisition post mortem taken in the reign of Henry VI. resided at \" Hynkershyll,\" (Inkersell) and it was not till the time of John Ormond, who was buried in the church of Alfreton, that they fixed their abode here. An extensive manor house was then built, which continued until pulled down for the erection of the present building. Its situation was near the church, on the north side of the place where the out-houses now stand. Alfreton hall, the family seat, occupying an elevated and pleasant site, was built by Rowland Morewood, esq. about a century ago. This gentleman was remarkable for being the first in that part ofthe county who attempted to shoot flying, and for his fondness for planting oak trees ; which passion being inherited by his son, he saw many thousands rise into shady groves and sturdy timber, which, added to rich veins of coals, increased a moderate fortune to a very considerable one ; the principal part of which he left to his widow. The present mansion-house is built of capital freestone, a little to the west of the old building. The house stands on a fine elevation, commanding pleasing views ofthe surrounding country from the north and west fronts. The present owner has enlarged and considerably improved the house. The adjoining grounds, according to their extent, are well laid out. Below the house is a piece of woodland, the upper part of which is intersected by two avenues; one is terminated by a temple of Diana and a fine bust ; and the other of them by an obelisk above, and below by a piece of water, the boundaries of which not being seen from the farthest point of view, the imagination is left to form to itself\" the idea of unlimited expansion, by which it is easily induced to transform a little fish-pond into an extensive lake. Below are several rural moss huts, and a grotto, built ofthe different fossils and minerals of all that diversity of form and colour exhibited in the mineral productions of the Peak. It is of an octagon form, and within are painted representations of several scenes described in Walton's Angler. The house is furnished with a considerable collection of paintings (some of them by the best masters) with a valuable library of ancient and modern authors, and near to the house are excellent gardens well stored with choice fruits and vegetables. Eminent natives William Muggliston and Benjamin Outram, see nctice of in Biography, Vol. I. ALKMANTON, a village, township and constablery in the parish of Longford and hundred Alchementune, 0f Appletree, contains 12 houses, 12 families, and SI inhabitants, all of whom"], [32, "16 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER are employed in agriculture. This township contains 736 a. 2 r. 4i p. of good land, principally upon the red marl, 22 acres of which is planted ; part of it is tithe free, and part titheable. The whole is divided into five farms, and the average rental is about \u00a3.2. per acre. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a3917. l6s. 2d. The parochial expenses have averaged \u00a357- per annum for the last eight years. Mr. Evans has built a new school-house for the use of the children of Alkmanton and Bentley, and about twenty-four scholars are instructed free, at the expense of that gentleman and Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. In Alchementune, Uliel had one carucale and a half of land to be taxed. Land io two ploughs. There are now two ploughs in the demesne, and eight villanes and seven bordars, having two ploughs and twelve acres of meadow.

Ralf de Bakepuize held it, and his descendant Galfred de Bakepuize : aster which it came to the family of Blount, in the same manner as Barton, and continued in it until it came, either by marriage or purchase, to William Barnesley. On the 23rd of January, 1674, Charles Barnesley, esq. son and heir of Gilbert Barnesley, esq. of Alkmanton, sold this estate to Thomas Browne, esq. of Bentley, for \u00a32300. The Earl of Chesterfield purchased it of the Brownes in 1727. Earl Stanhope sold it in 1781 to the late Thomas Evans, esq. of Derby, and it is now the property of his grandson, Wil liam Evans, of Allestree, esq. M. P. Between this village and Bentley stood the hospital of St. Leonard, which if not founded, was at least further endowed by Walter Blount, Lord Mountjoy ; for by his will, bearing date 1 474, he bequeathed lands of \u00a310. per annum value to the ancient hospital of St. Leonard, to pray for the souls of himself, his children and his ancestors ; for the souls of Humphry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, Earl Rivers, Sir John Woodville and the ancient lords of the hospital, and to repeat the psalter of the Virgin Mary twice every day in the chapel of the hospital. And further, he di rected that the master of the hospital should find seven poor men, such as had been old serving men with the lords of Barton, patrons ofthe said hospital, or old tenants ofthe said lands in Der byshire or Staffordshire, to be fifty-five years old when elected, at least, and to have 2s. id. per week paid by the said master, and each to have a cow-gate in Barton park, and a load of wood yearly out of it for firing; and every third year a gown and hood of white or russet cloth, alter nately marked with a Tazene cross of red, and that none of those poor men should go a begging on pain of being dismissed. Lord Mountjoy directed also that a chapel should be built at Alk manton, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and that the master ofthe hospital should say mass in it yearly, on the festival of St. Nicholas. There are no remains of the hospital or of the chapel of St. Nicholas. Allenhill, formerly a residence of the elder branch of the Wolley family, is in the parish of Matlock. ALLESTREE, 2 m. N. of Derby, on the road to Dumeld, &c. a parochial village, township, Adelardestrew, constablery and chapelry in the parish of Mackworth, deanery of Derby and es rey' hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. This village is pleasantly seated on the west bank ofthe Derwent, and consisted, in 1821, of 67 houses, 70 families and 36 1 inhabitants. Of the 70 families 18 were employed in agriculture, 38 in trade, chiefly cotton spinning, and 14 variously. The inhabitants according to a recent enumeration, amount to upwards of 500. The township contains about 1 030 acres of excellent land, divided amongst fourteen freeholders. The principal landed proprietors are William Evans, esq. M. P. who owns about 400 acres, 30 acres of which are planted ; Walter Evans, esq. has 220 acres, on which he keeps a dairy of fifty prime short horned cows to supply his work people with milk; Francis Mundy, esq. M. P. has 130 acres; Bache Thornhill, esq. 150 acres; and Mr. Hall, of Boulton, 6*0 acres; the others are small freeholders. The average rental is about 50s. per acre. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a31865. 12s. 6d. The average amount of the poor rates, for the last seven years, is about \u00a3.111. . county rates, \u00a326. ; and highways, \u00a320. per annum."], [33, "17 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. There are a Methodist chapel, an infant, a day, and two Sunday schools, and two public houses in this village. The schools are chiefly supported by Walter Evans, esq. of Darley. Adelardestrcw , is described in Doomsday-Book as a hamlet ofthe manor of Markeaton ; and it appears ever since to have been held with it; being now the property of Francis Mundy, esq. M. P. of Markeaton. At Allestree one messuage, two cottages, three ox-gangs of land, and Is. 6d. annual rent formerly belonged to Darley abbey. The Mundy family were owners of this lordship upwards of two centuries: the late F. N. C. Mundy, esq. sold 'a considerable part ofthe estate to the late Thomas Evans, and Charles Upton, esqrs. of Derby, and Bache Thornhill, esq. of Stan ton in the Peak ; the latter afterwards purchased the house and land conveyed to Mr. Upton, and built a handsome modern mansion on the estate. About the year 1805 Mr. Thornhill conveyed this estate to John Charles Girardot, esq. from whom William Evans, esq. has purchased it. The estate purchased by Thomas Evans, esq. is now the property of Walter Evans, esq. of Darley hall. The ancient church, with a square tower and a Saxon porch, stands on an elevated site. In the church-yard is a yew tree of large dimensions, which appears to be of equal antiquity with the church. The church, which formerly belonged to the abbey of Darley, is dedicated to St. Andrew. The living is a donative curacy of the clear value of \u00a35. Francis Mundy, esq. M. P. is the patron. The present annual value is about \u00a355. The Rev.

P. stands on an elevated site, on the west bank of the Derwent, in the centre of a fine park, backed with a thriving plantation ; a rich lawn spreads in the front of it, and a large sheet of water in the valley, at some distance from the man sion, adds much to the beauty of the scenery. The prospects from the hall are rich landscapes of great variety. The house has been enlarged and much improved internally, and also in its ex ternal appearance, since Mr. Evans has made it his residence. The north-west front is adorned with a handsome portico. On the south are the conservatories, green-houses and vineries, and on the west are the coach houses and stables. The respectable family of the Evans, of Allestree and Darley, had its rise in the reign of Wil liam and Mary, by the marriage of Anthony Evans, yeoman, of Winster, to Hannah, co-heiress of Edmund Feme, a considerable landowner of Bonsall. Many individuals of this family have been distinguished for their enterprize and acquisitions. The late Thomas Evans, esq. es tablished the bank at Derby, which is now under the conduct of his son and grandson, and was for many years county treasurer. He died at the advanced age of 9U possessed, it is said, of \u00a3800,000. the honourable accumulation of the proceeds arising from the useful works he founded at Darley Abbey and at Derby. These works were manufactories of cotton, paper, copper, tin, iron, &c. The estates he purchased in this county were extensive, and it was a custom, in which he took great pleasure, to have some of his tenants for his guests every market day, from whose conversation he obtained an insight into the agricultural interests of themselves and their la bourers. He was equally attentive to those in his manufacturing concerns, and by his will made many of his most confidential servants partners in the works. His son, Walter Evans, esq. erected the elegant church at Darley, and instituted free schools at Darley, Parwich and Allestree. Ed mund Evans, an attorney at law, also accumulated great wealth, which was inherited by his surviving daughter, the wife of John Harrison, of Snelston hall, esq. William Evans, now M. P. for Leicester, formerly represented the borough of Retford, in Nottinghamshire, in Parliament : in 1 826, he stood a severely contested election for Leicester, which, according to public report, cost him not less than \u00a320,000. No man has been more distinguished for his upright and patri otic conduct in the senate. He was high sheriff for Derbyshire in 1829: as a landowner, he holds above 3750 acres in this county, including the manors of Alkmanton, Brailssord, Newton Grange and Parwich."], [35, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY 19 \u25a0 ARMS. \u2014 Quarterly 1 and 4 Evans, Girony of eight, Argent and Vert, a Lion rampant gardant, Or. 2 and 3 Feme, per bend indented, Argent and Gules, two Lions' Heads erased, counterchanged, ducally crowned, Or.

Alton, s. of Wirksworth, is part of the township of Iderhidgehay. William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, in the reign of Henry III. conveyed the manor to Richard Buron or Byron, and his heirs, whose descendant, Sir Nicholas Byron, died seised of it in 1503. It was afterwards successively in the Blackwalls and Iretons ; the latter sold it about the middle of the 17th cen tury to Henry Mellor ; his brother sold it to the Hon. Anchetil Grey. George Grey, Earl of Stamford, sold it in 1747, to Dr. (afterwards Sir Edward) Wilmot, grandfather of Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. of Chaddesden, who is the present proprietor. This manor contains 500 acres of good strong land, watered by the river Ecclesbourne. There are several pews in the body and gallery of Wirksworth church belonging to this estate. The tithes are taken by composition. The roads are much improved. William White, gent, an eminent land-surveyor and valuer, agent to Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. and Richard Arkwright, esq. who resides at the ancient hall or manor house. Alport, in the parish of Hope. Alport, a small village in the parish of Yolgrave, containing about 22 houses, is seated on the river Lathkil. There is a paper-mill and a dye-house at this place. It is the property of the Duke of Rutland. The following paragraphs relating to this village are extracted from Rhodes's Peak Scenery. Alport is a pleasant place, and the greater part of its inhabitants appear to be in reputable cir cumstances, if the houses where they reside may be regarded as a fair criterion : they are gen erally good stone buildings, and sufficiently spacious for all the purposes of comfort : a neat flower-garden, belted with laurel, lilacs, and libernum, lies before them, and an orchard well stored with fruit trees spreads behind. There are of course some inferior dwellings, but not the proportion usually found in a country village. \" The tufa in Derbyshire is universally regarded as a watery deposit very rapidly produced, and it contains indisputable evidences of its formation. At Alport, a large mass of rock, from forty to sixty feet high, is entirely composed of this material ; and being adorned with trees, that either shoot from its sides, or take root upon its summit, it is not only a curious, but a picturesque object. \" This rock appears to be a congregation of matter, chiefly vegetable, which has been formed into an immense petrefaction by the continual action of water, but at what period is uncertain, as the stream that produced it has either ceased to flow, or has changed its course. The limestone strata of Derbyshire abounds with a variety of animal and vegetable remains, which time has hardened into stone ; but in the tufa rocks they are often embedded in their native state : branches of trees are frequently found within them ; and in some places they appear an accumulation of sticks, straws, and weeds, closely enveloped in calcarious incrustations; amongst these the natural snail-shell, not in the least altered in appearance, is often found. In one place, where the rock had been recently broken, and the trunk of a small birch tree, about six or eight inches diameter, taken out, we noticed the impression that remained, and took from it a part of the bark that was left behind, which was not at all affected in its nature by its long imprisonment. Some few years ago, the head and horns of a stag, now in the possession of a gentleman at Bakewell, were taken entire from out the tufa rocks at this place. It is not to the geologist only that this curious lime deposit is in teresting : a great variety ofthe most beautiful plants and flowers grow upon it ; it is, therefore, equally attractive to the botanist. Here the common thistle flourishes luxuriantly, and displays great beauty, the flowers being peculiarly rich in colour : wild marjoram, mountain thyme, ladies' bed-straw, and a fine variety of bright yellow stone crop \u2014 The sedum of Linn\u00e6us, are also abun dant on these rocks. \" Leaving Alport, we passed a mill, romantically situate amongst rocks and trees : the water by which it was supplied was spread out into a lucid mirror, and the various objects that sur rounded it lay pictured on its surface in all the vivid colouring of nature. Near the mill, the stream is precipitated over a high semicircular wear into a deep basin below, forming a cascade, somewhat artificial, but yet extremely beautiful : agitated water is never otherwise ; and when, by the rapidity of its motion, it is whitened into foam, or broken into sparkling particles, it is one of the most pleasing objects that nature any where presents.\""], [37, ""], [38, ""], [39, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 21 ALSOP IN THE DALE is a pleasant little village, and with Cold Eaton forms a constabu- EUeshope, jary. chapelry and township in the deanery of Ashbourn and wa pentake of Wirksworth. The village of Alsop is 5^ m. N. W. of Ashbourn, and consists of three farm houses, besides the ancient manor house, which are seated in a deep valley. The township contains 8 houses, 9 families, and 60 inhabitants, employed in agriculture. Alsop contains 864 acres of good limestone land, or 22 ox-gangs, of which Walter Evans, esq. owns 280 acres or 8 ox-gangs ; Thomas Borough, esq. 6 ox-gangs, the Rev. Charles Stead Hope 5 ox-gangs or 206 acres ; the other 3 ox-gangs belong to Mr. Mart, Mr. Dakin, and Mr. Dale. Cold Eaton contains 1 1 ox-gangs or 595 acres of limestone land, of which the Duke of Rutland owns 8 ox-gangs or 430 acres, and Mr. Anthony Beresford, of Castern, the other 3 ox-gangs. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings of the township is \u00a31884. 10*. The average of seven years' parochial expenses is \u00a37 4. per annum. The great tithes belono- to the Dean of Lincoln, and are leased to G. H. Errington, esq. and now produce about \u00a3200. a year. In 1086 Elleshope and Eitun were bere wicks to the manor of Parwich. Alsop, which had been parcel of the ancient demesnes of the crown, was granted to William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby who, in the reign of king John, granted the town of Alsop to Gweno, son of Gamel de Alsop, to hold by homage and service of 10*. per annum and suit to the wapentake of Wirksworth. His descendants enjoyed the same for seventeen generations, until Anthony Allsop, esq. sold, in 1688 and 1 689, several estates in Alsop, Newton and Thorpe, to John Borrow, of Derby, esq. ancestor ofthe before mentioned Thomas Borough, esq. and in 1691, the capital messuage and an estate here to Sir Philip Gell, bart. This Anthony Allsop married a daughter of Sir John Gell, by whom he had numerous issue. The present male representative of the family is Samuel Allsopp, esq. of Burton upon Trent, in the county of Stafford. The Beresfords afterwards held the manor, and from them it passed by a co-heiress to the Milwards. It passed by successive sales in 1711, 1 753, &c. to Smith of Hopton, Pole of Nottingham, and Beresford of Basford. The late Francis Beresford, of Ashbourn, esq. sold it to Mr. John Brownson, of Alsop, who sold it to Walter Evans, of Darley, esq. the present owner. A family of the name of Mellor resided here for sev eral generations on an estate now the property of the Rev. Charles Stead Hope, of Derby, who married one of the co-heiresses of the late Robert Mellor, esq. the other co-heiress married the Rev. Richard Rowland Ward, of Derby. Cold Eaton was granted by king John to William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby. After the at tainder of his great grandson, it was given to Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and the Wensleys held it under the earldom and duchy of Lancaster from the beginning of the reign of Edward III. until the latter end ofthe reign of Edward IV. About the year 1518, it appears to have belong ed to the Vernons of Haddon, from whom the greater part descended to the present Duke of Rutland. A fourth part was many years in the Boothby family, and is now the property of Mr. Anthony Beresford, of Castern. The ancient church at Alsop is dedicated to St. Michael, in which there are some good speci mens of Norman architecture.

There are a Wesleyan Methodist, a Baptist, and a Presbyterian chapel, a Sunday school, sup ported by voluntary contributions, an endowed parochial day-school, three innkeepers, and only one stocking-frame in this township. At the time of the Doomsday Survey the manor of Alvaston, then called Alewoldestune, was held by Tochi under Geoffery Alselin, Azelin, or Hanselin. This manor was given by Wulfric Spott to Burton Abbey. It belonged afterwards to Ralph Fitz Germund, the founder of Dale abbey, in this county, whose descendant, Matilda de Salicosa Mare, daughter of William Fitz Ralph, seneschal of Normandy, gave Alwoldestune to that monastery. In the time of Henry II. the Bardolfs were possessed of this manor. William Bardolf held five knights' fees and a half in Egginton, Alwoldeston, Okebroc, Amboldeston and Bolton. One of the Bardolfs married Rose, heiress of Ralf Hanselin of Shelford, a baron, from whom it came in the time of Edward I. to Anker de Frescheville. In 3 Edward III. by an inquisition taken after the death of Thomas Bardolf, it was found that Margaret, the wife of Ralph de Frescheville, and Ralph, the son of Ralph de Lathebury, held of the said Thomas Bardolf two knights' fees in Alwaldeston, Aylwal deston, Thurleston, Egginton, Ambaldeston, and Boleton, in the county of Derby. In the reign of Richard II. the abbeys of Darley and Dale had considerable estates here and at Boulton. Henry III. in the 36th year of his reign granted to Ralph Frescheville that he and his heirs for ever should have free warren in all his manors, viz. In the manor of Boney, in the county of Not tingham, and Crich, Scardeciive, Alwodeston, Chelardeston, with their appurtenances, in the county of Derby, and Cussewortham, in the county of York. By an inquisition taken at Derby, on the Wednesday next after the feast of St. Wolfred, in 4 Henry V. on the death of Ralph Fresche ville, of Staveley, knt. it was found that the said Ralph died seised of divers parcels of lands and tenements lying in Alvaston, Thurleston, and Ambaston, with their appurtenances, and that the said parcels were held of the king in chief, by military tenure, and that the said parcels were worth about 10 marks by the year. In 9 Henry VI. two parts ofthe manor of Alvaston, which had belonged to Gervase Frescheville, were in the hands ofthe king, owing to the minority of Peter, the son and heir of the said Gervase. About this time Sir William Philips appears to have been possessed of an estate at Alvaston, which came to his grandson, Henry Lord Viscount Beau mont.

William Sacheverell, esq. died seised of it in 1557. It afterwards passed into a branch ofthe Allestree family, who had a seat here; and from whom it descended to the Borrows, by reason of the marriage of Mary Allestree with John Tempest Borrow, esq. eldest son of Isaac Borrow, who was the only son of John Borrow. J. T. Borrow, esq. dying without issue, devised all his estates to his nephew, John Borrow, esq. the eldest son of his youngest brother, John Borrow, late of Hulland, in this county : by whom it was sold, in IS 12, to John Elliott, esq. of Nottingham. It has since been divided into several ties. The Earl of Harrington purchased the manor of Mr. Elliott, and Mr. Joseph Wheeldon the hall and some of the demesne lands. The two townships of Alvaston and Boulton were taxed, in 1712, at \u00a3121. 1*. The church is a neat little structure, and formerly belonged to the church of St. Michael, in Derby. It was given by William Fitz Ralph and Robert his son to the abbey of Darley, which gift Ralph de Frescheville confirmed. In the reign of Henry VII. there was a strong contention between the abbot, the vicar of St. Michael, and the inhabitants of Alvaston, concerning their respective rights and privileges. At length, growing weary of disputes, they came to a general agreement, that the abbot and convent of the monastery of Darley should have the tithe of hay and corn in the liberty ; that the inhabitants should present a chaplain, and allow him for his support the lesser tithes and oblations ; and that they should pay three pounds a year to the vicar of St. Michael's. They also agreed to attend the parish church of St. Michael once a year, and to be present at the feast of the Relics. The living is a curacy, valued at \u00a34. 4*. 2d. in the gift of the inhabitants. It has been augmented with \u00a3400. from Queen Anne's bounty, now worth .about \u00a3 120. a year. The Rev.

Another of this family, lineally descended from this Sir Edmund, was George Appleby, slain in defence of the Isle of Inkippe, near Scotland, after Musselborough field, 1 Edward IV. whose widow, Joyce, daughter of Thomas Curzon, of Crox hall, in the county of Derby, after married to one Thomas Lewis, of Mancester, in Warwickshire, was burnt at Coventry, 1557, for her religion ; of whom Mr Fox has written in his book of the Acts and Monuments ofthe Martyrs.

This ancient family had their seat a little to the east ofthe church, of which sufficient remains are still visible to show what it has been, a strong, though not large mansion of defence, built of massy stone, and entirely surrounded by a moat, with no other entrance than that of a draw bridge. The front wall is still pretty perfect in its original state ; some carved work, but no arms, though a few plain escutcheons may be seen. It has for a considerable time belonged to Bosworth school, and is now inhabited by a farmer. The church is a handsome gothic structure, with a square tower terminated by a beautiful spire, dedicated to St. Michael. In 1829 it underwent a thorough repair, which, according to the estimated cost, would be considerably more than \u00a32000. independent ofthe chancel, which is re paired at the expense of the rector. The advowson of the church was given by Richard Fitz Roger to Latham priory, Lancashire, where he founded a cell to Durham. In 1286 a jury found that the presentation to the church belonged to Latham priory, and not to William Vernon. In 1291 Burton abbey had a pension of 7*. from the church. In 1362 Durham priory had license to appropriate the church, the advowson of which belonged to it. In 1660 William Mould pur chased the advowson, and by regular descent it came to Elizabeth, wife of Edward Dawson, E"], [44, "26 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER ancestor to Edward Dawson, esq. of Long Whatton, who sold the presentation to the Guardians of George Moore, esq. In 1535 a pension was paid of 13s. id. to Latham priory, and \u00a32. to the rector of Seale, and the rectory was valued at \u00a320. 9s. 3d. There are 423 acres of glebe land ; and the present value of the living is about \u00a31000. per annum. The late Rev. Thomas Jones was many years rector, he was succeeded in 1830, by John M. Echalaz, M. A. Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Oxford, the present rector. Arms and Inscriptions in the Church.

With these and other accessions of wealth, she was not high minded, but preserved great humility in her state of life. She was a woman of un affected piety, strict probity and great affability, an in dulgent parent, a sincere friend, a tender mistress. She spent her life in constant expectation of death, and died in the most easy and composed manner, on Sunday, the 9th of June, 1764, in the 75th year of her age, leaving two sons and two daughters.

APPLEBY, LITTLE, Is a hamlet to the parish of Great Appleby, in the hundred of Repton Applebie Parva. and Gresley, 118m. from London, containing about 99 houses, and 495 inhabitants. It is a pleasant village, situate partly in Derbyshire, and partly in Leicestershire. Appleby Parva anciently belonged to the Vernons, whose chief seat was at Haddon, in Derby shire. Vernon bare \" Argent, fretty Sable, a canton, Gules.\" In Little Applebi Robert held under Henry de Ferrers, one carucate, three soemen had two ploughs and three acres of meadow at the conquest. It appears by an old deed that Robert de Stokport gave this manor, with the advowson of the church of Great Appleby, to William de Vernon and his heirs, about the reign of king John, yielding yearly to him and his heirs a sparrow-hawk, or twelve pence, at the feast-day of St. Peter ad vincula. In 1322 Richard Vernon, and Matilda, his wife, held the manor as ofthe honour of Tutbury, and in 1328 he had a grant of free warren here. In 3 Henry IV. Juliana Vernon was seised of the manor. The following documents are copied from ancient Charters, and from the Court Rolls, in the possession of Mr. Dewe, solicitor, Ashby-de-la-Zouch. KNOW all present and to come, that I, William de Vernon, have granted, and by this present Charter have confirmed, to William, the sonne of Robert de Appulbie, all the land of Appulbie, with the appurtenances and with the fifth part of the advowson, which he had of the gift of Lord William de Mullam and Amacie his wife, tarn in hirbus quam in dominices ; to have and to hold, to him and his heires, of mee and my heires, free and quiet ; rendering therefore annually, by him and his heires, to mee and my heires, two markes of silver, at the nativitie of St. John Baptist, for all services: and that this may obtain full strength, I have corroborated this Charter, with the putting to my seale this testibus, &c. N. B. There is no date to this deed. \" We find that the manor of Little Appleby is a very ancient manor, which hath court-leet and court-baron belonging to it; and that in the time of Edward the Illrd, after the Conquest, Richard de Vernon, knt. was lord of the said manor, as appears not only by accounts of the bai liff of the said manor, but also by two instruments in parchment in old French, under the seal of Maud, wife of Richard de Vernon the younger. The purport whereof are as follows : \" To all to whom these letters shall come, Maud, who was the wife of Richard de Vernon the younger, sendeth greeting. In the Lord God. Know ye, that whereas Monsieur Richard de Vernon, knt. by his writing hath secured unto me an annuity of \u00a320. to take out of his manor of Little Applebie, in the countie of Leicester, during his life, at four terms of the yeare, by equal por tions: that is to say, at each term one hundred shillings ; and I have granted unto him, by my writing, that if hee pay mee at each of the termes aforesaid fiftie shillings, I will acquits him of the other fiftie shillings of the said terme. I, the said Maud, have received fiftie shillings of the said Sir Richard, at the terme of the nativity of our Lord, in the first year of the reigne of king Edward the Third, after the Conquest, and do acquitt him of the 100.. for the terme aforesaid. In witness whereof, to this letter of acquittance I have put my seale ; given at Harleston, on Monday, the morrow of St. Nicholas, in the yeare aforesaid.\" \" Another, of the same purport, for Michaelmas quarter, in the second yeare of the said king Edward the Third.\" The last heir male of the noble house of Haddon, was Sir George Vernon, knt. who, about 9 Elizabeth, died seised of thirty manors, leaving issue by Mary his wife, daughter of Sir Gilbert Talbot, knt. two daughters co-heiressess ; Dorothy, married to Sir John Manners, knt. younger son of Thomas Manners, first Earl of Rutland, who with her had the manor of Haddon, and other manors and estates in Derbyshire. Margaret, the other daughter, married Sir Thomas Stanley, knt. younger son of Edward Stanley, Earl of Derby, by whom she had issue, Sir Edward Stanley, knt. who alienated this manor. It appears by a deed of partition between them, dated Srd January, 10 Elizabeth; and where they are thrice described as follows : \" Sir Thomas Stanley, of Winwich, in the county of Lancaster, knt. and Dame Margaret, his wife, one of the daughters and co-heirs of Sir George Vernon, late of Haddon, in the county of Derby, knt. on the one part, and John Manners, of Weaverton, in the county of Nottingham, esq. who married the other daughter and co-heir of the said Sir George Vernon, on the other part ;"], [46, "28 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER by this deed the manor of Little Appleby was allotted (with other estates) to Sir Thomas Stanley. In 1630, it was purchased of Sir Edward Griffin, knt. by Charles Moore, esq. in whose family it has ever since remained. The following additions we have from the collections of William Woolley, esq. written about the year 1714. \" The tenth of Elizabeth John Taylor, gent, died and left an estate here to his daughter Maud, who died 14th of Elizabeth, and John Taylor, the son of Richard, the son of Henry, the father of John, the father of the said Maud, inherited the same; and 40 Elizabeth, Humphrey Dethick, esq. of Newhall, died and left an estate here to his daughter Catharine, wife of Alexander Redick, esq. 43 Elizabeth John Rotheram, esq. one ofthe six clerks in Chancery, died possessed of an estate here, which he left to William, son and heir of Gilbert Willoughby, son and heir of Margaret, sister and heir ofthe said John. \" This town has been eminent for being the birth-place of Sir John Moore, knt. who being of mean parentage, raised himself a very great estate by merchandise, first in lead, and afterwards in the East India trade, whereby he became Lord Mayor of London, and was long president of Christ church, or the Blue-coat hospital, in London, to which he was a great benefactor, particularly in building and endowing the writing and mathematical schools there, in which he bestowed above \u00a36000. and built and endowed a very fine free-school in this town, on which he bestowed above \u00a35000. ; and after dying at a good old age, above 80, he left an estate of about \u00a380,000. a large part to his nephew, John Moore, esq. but withal gave very great legacies to his other nephews and nieces, which have made many families considerable which were not so before, and left as good a name behind him, for honour and sobriety, as most of his contemporaries ; only he was over awed at the latter end of king Charles the Second's reign, when he was Lord Mayor of London, to give up the City's charter, which was looked upon rather as the effect of his want of courage, than of justice and integrity ; though perhaps a man of far greater courage and resolution, in those trying times, might have been forced to have done the same. I believe all he got by it was a canton of the arms of England in his coat, which was \" O. three Moor-hens, S.\" Mr. Woolley 's blazonry of Sir John Moore's arms, as above, is incorrect ; the arms borne by the present Moores being as stated at the head of the Pedigree. The school is a very handsome brick building, with two similar fronts ; the one which faces the street or road, is enclosed in a very spacious grass area that affords sufficient air and exercise to the boys. The school-room is a noble size. At the upper end of it, in the wall, is represented in full proportion, the figure of the founder, in his official robes, with the mace and sword in either hand: underneath which is the following inscription, illustrative ofthe charity : \"To the memory of Sir John Moore, knight, and alderman ofthe city of London, who erected this school Anno Domini 1697, and endowed the same for the education of the male children of the parishes and towns of Appleby, Norton, Austery, Newton-in-the-Thistles, Stretton-in-the- Fields, Mesham, Snarston, and Chilcot. And by the statutes made A. D. 1 706, it was made free for all England.\" The right wing and rooms over the school are occupied by the head master and his boarders ; the left by the second master. It was erected by Sir Christopher Wren, and is altogether a very suitable edifice, and may serve as a model for others. At the back front, where before were also cloisters, has been added, within these fifty years, a large and comfortable dining or sitting room, for the use of the boys, more particularly in winter, where recreation or study may be car ried on in a more advantageous and agreeable manner. For let the \" Laudalores iemporis act\" say what they will of hardiness and capability of enduring the inclemencies of the weather, cer tainly such a necessary indulgence, as that above mentioned, is conducive, especially in these days, both to the health ofthe body and the improvement of the mind. Genius will not endure the hardships of freezing, however insensible dullness may be to it.

This liberty is entirely the property of Sir George Crewe, bart. and contains 810 acres of land. The average rental is about 27*. per acre. The amount of the poor rates last year was about \u00a3i k 2*. l\\d, ; county rate \u00a351. The roads in this township are all occupation roads. The estimated annual value of the lands, messuages, &c. in this liberty is \u00a3l 133. 5s. This village is governed by a constable. In Erlestone, Colegrini and Ravenchil had one carucate of land to be taxed. Land to one plough. There are now in the demesne two ploughs, and seven villanes with one plough.

The manor of Arleston was conveyed, in the year 14.26, by Thomas Bradshaw and Agnes, the wife of Robert del Stoke, to John Bothe, whose descendant, William Bothe, esq. died seised of it in 1519. It afterwards was the property of the Blounts ; Sir Henry Blount sold it, in IsilO, to Sir John Harpur, ancestor of Sir George Crewe, bart. the present proprietor. The Bothe family had a seat and resided here several generations. The manor of Sinfen or Sinfin belonged, in the reign of Edward I. Edward III. and 1 7 Richard II. to the family of Towke, who were succeeded by the Bothes. It is probable that the Towkes possessed Arleston also, as both estates passed from the Bothes to the Blounts. Sir George Crewe, bart. is the present proprietor. Sinfen Moor, containing 894 acres, was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1 802, and allotted amongst the adjoining townships of Sinfen, Barrow, Alvaston, Osmaston, Boulton, Normanton, Chellaston and Swarkstone. In 1827, another Act of Parliament was obtained to drain it. The Derby races were formerly held upon this large common. ASH, a small rural village, 1 m. W. of Etwall and 1 m. S. of Trusley, in the parish of Sutton- Eisse, on-the-Hill, and hundred of Appletree, consists of a tolerably good old hall and 5 or 6 farm-houses, pleasantly situate on a rising ground, and surrounded by good land. In Eisse Ulchel, Auic and Hacon had sixteen ox-gangs of land to be taxed. Land to t ivo ploughs. There are now two ploughs in the demesne, and seven villanes having one plough. There are eighteen acres of meadow, value in king Edward's lime 40.. now 30s. Robert holds it. D. B. 304. The manor of Ash, containing upwards of 800 acres of land, was given by William the Con queror to Henry de Ferrers. In 25 Edward I. Ralph de Bakepuze held it under Ralph de Roch ford, who held it under the Earl of Lancaster in 1296. In the reign of Richard II. it appears to have been in the Mackworth family. In 18 Henry VII. John Fitzherbert died and left this lord ship to his son Eustace, whose son John died 38 Henry VIII. and left it to his daughter Eliza beth, the wife of Sir Nicholas Draycott, of Paynsley, in Staffordshire. In 11 Henry VII. Wil liam Bothe of Arleston died, and left an estate here to his grandson John, which came to Nicholas Fitzherbert, who married Alice, daughter of Henry Bothe of Arleston. In the reign of James I. Gervase Sleigh, esq. purchased it, and left it to his son, Sir Samuel Sleigh, who left it to his daughter and co-heir Margaret, who married to James Chetham, of Turton tower, Lancashire, esq. ; his son Samuel succeeded to the estate, but dying without issue, it passed to Rowland Cotton, esq. of Bellaport in Shropshire, who had married the other co-heiress. It remained in this family until the death of William Cotton, esq. in 1825, when it passed with Dalbury and Sutton on the Hill to the Rev.

The town is situate in a deep valley, through which runs a small river, called the Schoo or Hen more, and to the inhabitants more generally known by the name of the Compton-brook. This stream falls into the Dove at Hanging-bridge. The southern part of the town is denominated Compton (anciently Campclene) and the northern portion is situate on elevated ground which is connected with the hills of Dove-dale. The entrance into Ashbourn, from Derby, descends rap idly, and presents an interesting view of the town and the romantic country around it. The steep ridge to the north, covered with houses, appears embosomed in wood ; and in the distance is seen Thorpe Cloud and many of the most striking objects that enrich the valley of the Dove. The houses are built chiefly with red brick, and are well sheltered from the boisterous winds ; and the whole grouping conveys a pleasing idea of security and social happiness. \u2014 The parish of Ashbourn consists of the vicarage, one chapelry, two townships and three liberties or hamlets in the neighbouring hundreds, according to the following enumeration, which comprises the returns ofthe number of inhabitants in 1801, 1S11 and 1821, with the estimated annual rental of the lands and buildings, and the acreage of each township. Of the 481 families in the township of Ashbourn, 23 were employed in agriculture, 370 in trade or handicraft, and the remaining 88 were engaged in professional pursuits or living independent. Many females are employed in figuring lace, and a few at the Hanging-bridge cotton mills. The town is chiefly supported by being a great thoroughfare, and having numerous fairs and good markets. The market-day is on Saturday, and the fairs are held the first Tuesday in Jan. the 13th of Feb. the second Tuesday in March, the 3rd of April, the last Thursday in April, the 21st of May, the 15th of July, the l6th of August, the third Tuesday in September, the 20th of Oc tober and the 29th of November. The February fair begins two days before that date and the October three days before. These are noted fairs for the sale of horses. Those of April and May are more particularly for the sale of milch cows, for which they are in great repute. Wool is sold at the July fair, which is the smallest in the year. The August and November fairs are chiefly for the sale of fat cattle. The March and September fairs are for the sale of cheese ; the day preceding each there is a fair for horned cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, &c. We have not met with any charter for the market on record; it certainly existed before 1296, and was then held, as it still continues to be, on Saturday ; there were then two fairs, each held for three days at the festivals of St. Oswald and St. John the Baptist. Five fairs are enumerated in the charter of Charles the First. Long before the reign of Edward VI. Ashbourn was a royal burgh,* when it appears to have \u2022 By an ancient document, of which the following is a translation, Ashbourn appears to have been a Royal Borough at a very remote period. In the ith year of Edward I. \u2014 They declare that the masters of the hospital of St. John de Yeveley have tenants under them, from the other side of the water of Esseburne, called Scolebrook, in the wapentake of Lutchyrch, who sell bread and ale contrary to the assize, and that the said masters receive the bread and ale so sold unjustly, to the great prejudice and injury of the freemen and the burg of Esseburne, and they know not by what warrant. They also declare that the said masters of the hospital appropriate to themselves, and seduce persons from the royal burg of Esseburne to be tenants under themselves and under their protection, whence the lord the king loses toll and pas sage-fees from tenants of this kind. And also the masters have made for themselves a new stamp and stamp gallon ASHBOURN PARISH. 1801. Persons. 1811, I Persons. Houses. POPULATION. 1821. Families. 481 Acreage. I Estimated Annual Rental.

The number of inhab itants may now be estimated at 2500. The average amount of the poor rates, county rate and constables' accounts, for the last seven years, is \u00a3Ssi0. 0... id. per annum ; the highways about \u00a357. per annum ; and the church rates are collected from the whole parish. The poor are main tained in a workhouse, and the pauper children are apprenticed to trades. There is a free grammar school, and an English school for 30 boys and 30 girls, well endowed ; a national day school, two Sunday-schools of the church establishment and one Methodist Sunday-school, supported by voluntary contributions. A Baptist and Methodist chapel, a Calvinist chapel in Compton, an almshouse for clergymen's widows, and three others for widows, widowers and decayed housekeepers, the founders of which will be noticed hereafter ; two bridges and the share of a third in this township are repaired by the county. There are three men's and one women's sick clubs, 28 inn-keepers and about 100 freeholders, besides several copy-holders in this township. The magistrates hold their petty sessions every Saturday to transact business. Sir William Boothby, bart. is lord of the manor, and holds a court leet annually, at which time the constable and headborough are sworn in. The lord of the manor receives the tolls of the fairs and markets, and appoints proper persons to inspect the weights and measures. In the month of February, lsi44, there was a battle fought near to Ashbourn, between the royalists and the parliamentarians, in which the royalists were defeated with considerable loss ; 170 were taken prisoners. King Charles was at Ashbourn in the month of August, 10*45, and attended divine service at the church ; his army at this time consisted of about 3000 men, which he marched through the Peak of Derbyshire to Doncaster. In 1745, Charles Stuart, the Pretender, marched his army twice through Ashbourn; first on his approach to Derby, and again on his retreat to Scotland. On which occasions he and his principal officers took possession of Ashbourn hall. The bed in which the prince slept is still preserved. and bushel-measures, without such warrant as the inhabitants of the borough have been accustomed to. And the said masters have an oven for making saleable bread, to the grievous loss of the aforesaid royal borough of Esseburne. Also they declare, that from that side of the aforesaid water, there is a certain township called Campeden-strete, in the Hundred of Appletree, and ought to be, as it were, a country village ; and that men remain in the said township and sell bread and ale contrary to the assize and without warrant. And that they put the said bread for sale into their windows, and they use the aforesaid stamp for bread, for bottles and for bushels, without warrant, to the great loss of our said lord the king. They also declare that Robert de Mapleton has an oven, in that part in Campedene-strete, and that he had spoken with a certain Robert of Esseburne, who then possessed the said village, concerning a firm agreement, and he conceded to the said Robert of Esseburne, that for the space of one year he might make bread for sale in the aforesaid oven, whence on account of that oven and the oven of the aforenamed masters of the hospital, the said borough of the lord the king was greatly injured and aggrieved. And that Thomas, the son and heir of the said Robert de Mapleton, holds the said oven for a yearly sum of money, which said sum of money ought to be paid yearly to our lord the king, on account of an agreement sanctioned between Robert, Earl Ferrers, and Henry de Esse burne. And this agreement bears date in the reign of the late lord king Henry, and runs thus \u2014 \" Of those who pos sess liberties granted them by our lord the king, &c.\"\u2014 They also declare that Thomas de Mapleton, Richard Hcrvi, Nicholas de Mercinton and Henry of Esseburne, clerk, do not rightfully exercise the freedom of the town of Esse burne, as they ought to do, for that they fine the bakers and the brewers in their absence, and not in full court as was customary to be done : and that they fine them at their own discretion ; and that there used to be in the said town only two assessors, and that now there are four, contrary to the liberty of the aforesaid town, and therefore to the grievous loss and detriment of the aforesaid borough of our lord the king, who now reigns. And further they declare that a certain vicar, namely, of the church of Esseburne, obstructed a path-way, near Lovcdich, and that Peter de Wyneton, now rector of the church, supports him in that injury \u2014 They also declare, that a certain Ranulph of Mer cinton obstructed another path, leading out of the king's highway from Esseburne to Scclcbrook, between the new place and tenement of the said Ranulph; and Roger de Mercinton abets him in the same injury Of military tenures, &c. They declare that two messuages at the end of the town of Esseburne, towards Underwode, were given in charity to the abbey of iMiravalli, to make for the monks of that place a house of hospitality, by lord William the old Earl of Ferrers, that nothing is paid, and that the messuages are lying waste Concerning the clergy and other magistrates, &c. They declare that Thomas de Gloucheswich was seized and detained in person, and put in chains, on suspicion ; and liberated by Henry Oweyn, then the bailiff of Lord Edmund, for XLs Persons they fined and liberated in the time of the late king Henry \u2014 They also declare, that Laurence, Clerk, and Nicholas of Mercin ton, in the time of the late king Henry, by night seized two men and two women cf Esseburne upon suspicion and took from them a certain quantity of wax and cloth, of the value of XX.. and more, and promised them to \"et a' war rant respecting the wax and cloth, which they have never restored."], [53, "33 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. In Esseburne there are three carucates of land to be taxed. Land to three ploughs. It is waste, yet it pays twenty shillings. There is a priest and a church, with one carucale of land to be taxed ; and he has there two villanes and two bordars, having half a plough. Himself has one plough, and one vassal who pays sixteen pence ; and twenty acres of meadow. These five manors, Derelei, Mestes forde, Werckesuorde, Esseburne and Peureuuic, with their berewicks, paid in king Edward's lime thirty-two pounds, and six sextaries and a half of honey, now forty pounds of pure silver. D. B. At the time ofthe Norman Conquest, the town and manor of Ashbourn belonged to the king. But William Ferrers, by a charter dated the 11th of July, in the first year of the reign of king John, obtained from the crown to himself and his heirs, a grant in fee-farm of the manors of Wirksworth and Ashbourn, together with the whole wapentake, on condition that he paid to the exchequer \u00a370. sterling at Michaelmas and Easter by even portions. In the fifth year of the same reign, he obtained a grant of the inheritance of these manors with the wapentake, for which he paid 500 marks. In the reign of Henry III. it was seized by the crown, on the rebellion of Robert de Ferrers, son of William. In 25 Edward I. Edmund Crouchback, brother of the king and earl of Lancaster, died possessed of the manor of Ashbourn. In 9 Edward II. Stephen de Seagrave held lands here. In the time of Edward III. Thomas, earl of Lancaster, owned the manor. In the same reign, Roger Mortimer, earl of March, procured for his son a grant of the wapentake of Risley and Ashbourn in the Peak, being parcels of the lands of the late Edmund, earl of Kent, attainted. In the reign of Henry IV. John Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, held the manor. This manor continued to be annexed to the earldom and duchy of Lancaster, until the time of Charles I. who in the year lsi33 sold or granted it to William Scriven and Philip Eden, who conveyed it to Sir John Coke, of Melbourn, knt. one of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, and his son, John Coke, esq. ; from the latter it passed by sale, in the reign of Charles II. to Sir William Boothby, of Broadlow-Ash, bart. whose lineal descendant and male heir, Sir William Boothby, of Ashbourn hall, bart. is the present owner. The church is a gothic building, in the form of a cross, with a square tower in the centre, ter- minated with a beautiful and lofty octagonal spire, enriched with ornamental workmanship, and pierced by twenty windows. The building is principally early English, with various alterations, additions and insertions of later styles. The nave has very fine early English piers and arches. The chancel is of the same character, but with a perpendicular east window of seven lights in- serted; there are three plain stone stalls in the chancel. The north transept has decorated win- dows ; the south transept a large perpendicular window. The font is fine, clearly early English. There are several good early English door-ways. Over the whole of this church, the different styles are very much mixed, but the walls and buttresses appear mostly of the original character of the church. The roof is supported by several pointed arches ; the interior is spacious, but not commodiously disposed, though galleries have been erected for the convenience of the congrega- tion. At what time it was built is uncertain, though probably it was in the thirteenth century, for we find that it was dedicated to St. Oswald, by Patishull, bishop of Coventry, in the year 1241 ; as appears by an inscription on a brass plate, found on repairing the church, some years ago, which is as follows: \" Anno ab incarnaliotie Dno MCCXlj Fill die Maij dedicata est h\u00e6c eccia et, hocaltare consecratum in honore sci Oswaldi regis et martiris a venerabili patre Dno Hugoni de Patis- hull Coventrensi Episcopo.\" In the Harleian manuscripts, No. 1486\", folio 49, 6, isa copy of this inscription (differing in a few letters only) which is then said to be written in an old Saxon char- acter, in brass, in Mr. Cokaine's house at Ashbourn. There is no date to the memorandum. This brass was probably fixed up in the church at the time the ancient hall was taken down. It is re- markable, that the bishop should be styled, of Coventry only. This church, together with the chapels, lands, tithes and other appurtenances belonging thereto, were granted by William Rufus, to the church of St. Mary, in Lincoln, and to the bishop of that see and his successors. In consequence of some arrangement made at a remote period, the rectory became appropriated to the deans of Lincoln, under whom it was held on lease for many years by the Cokaine family, and of late by the Erringtons. The present lessee is George Henry Errington, esq. The rectory of Mappleton is annexed to the vicarage of Ashbourn. The vicarage has been augmented with a F"], [54, "34 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER parliamentary grant of \u00a3600. and the present value is about \u00a3100. per annum, and ofthe rectory \u00a3200. per annum. The Rev. Samuel Shipley is the present incumbent. The church is fur nished with a good organ, and the tower contains eight bells. A chantry was founded at the altar of St. Mary, in Ashbourn church, and endowed by Henry de Kniveton, parson of Norbury, in the reign of Richard II. Another chantry, in honour of St. Oswald, was founded in or about the year 1483, by John Bradbume and Anne his wife. Lecture, otherwise to the poor. \u2014 About lsiSO, the sum of \u00a3400. was given by different persons, which is vested in trustees and produces \u00a340. a year, being a rent-charge out of an estate at Walton, belonging to Sir John Henry Hunloke, bart.

This frail memorial had not asked a tear, O'er Hill's cold ashes, sadly mouldering here : Friendship's chaste frame her ardent bosom fired, And bright religion all her soul inspired : Her soul too heavenly for an house of clay, Soon wore its earth-built mansion to decay. In the last struggles of departing breath, She saw her Saviour gild the bed of death ; Heard his mild accents tuned to peace and love, Breathe a blest welcome to the realms above ; To those bright regions, that celestial shore, Where friends long lost, shall meet to part no more. \" Blest Lord, I come,\" my hopes have not been vain : Upon her lifeless cheek, extatic smiles remain.

Chaste earth, within thy hallowed breast, Let these sad relics peaceful rest ; The mortal spoils, an angel mind, Mounting to heaven, has left behind. Her bosom pure as virgin snow, Did with each mild affection glow, Almost from human frailties free, Yet boundless was her charity ; The sense in her that brightly shone, Seemed to her modest self unknown. Reader, no poet's pencil drew This portrait, it is simply true ; O, all-beloved, the general woe Thy universal worth may show : And, O, too soon, united here, With parents, to thy bosom dear, Sleep by a well-loved mother's side, In life her chiefest joy and pride. Sister, farewell, nor time, nor place, Maria's memory shall efface : Thy brothers, who inscribed this stone, With their last sigh thy loss shall moan. Another.

The little sufferer, indeed, appears as if she had .just changed her position, by one of those frequent turnings to which illness often in vain resorts for relief from pain.

April, 1050; as she was carried to the church, some thought they heard a rumbling in the coffin ; as the earth was cast upon the coffin, a noise was heard like the bursting of a little bladder ; soon after the people were gone from the funeral, a widow woman, named Ann Chadwick, not being satisfied, went again to the grave, kneeling down and laying her ear to the ground, she heard a sighing ; she called a soldier to her that was passing that way, who heard the same ; they immediately went to Mr. Pegg, a justice of the peace, who ordered the grave to be opened ; the coffin was discovered to be warm, and the woman had pulled some hurds out of her mouth, which had stopped it before she was put into the coffin ; they found also a child, delivered and descended as low or lower than the knees, with one hand in its mouth and the other stretched out by its side : the after birth was also come from her.

The ancient and eminent family of Cokayne, resided and flourished for many generations in this town, and had considerable estates in the county, much increased by a match with the heiress of Herthull, and were many years lessees of the rectory of Ashbourn under the dean of Lincoln. Several were eminent statesmen, lawyers and warriors, in the reigns of Edward III. Richard II. and Henries IV. V. and VI. John Cokayne, esq. knight of the shire, who died in 1372-3, lies buried in Ashbourn church, as does also several of his descendants, as appears by the altar tombs and inscriptions to their memories. Sir John Cokayne, one of the sons of the abovenamed John, was founder of the Cokaynes of Cokayne Hatley in Bedfordshire ; now passed by a female heir to the Casts. John Cokayne, who died in 1403, was knighted by Henry IV. at the battle of Shrewsbury, and killed in that conflict. He was baron of the exchequer. His nephew, Sir John, represented the county of Derby in several parliaments ; he was a justice of the common pleas, made his will in 1434, and lies buried in Ashbourn church. Sir Thomas Cokayne, who died in 1592, was author of a short treatise on huntyng, compiled for the delight of noblemen and gentlemen, now extremely rare. His great grandson, Sir Aston Cokayne, was author of several dramatic and other poems, epitaphs, &c. in the reign of Charles I. He was born at Elvaston, and resided chiefly at Pooley in Warwickshire. In the year 1 671, he joined with his son, Thomas Cokayne, esq. (the last male heir of this branch of the family) in the sale of Ashbourn hall and other estates, to Sir William Boothby, bart. Ashbourn hall, the seat of Sir William Boothby, bart. was from remote antiquity the residence of the Cokaynes, one of the most eminent Derbyshire families. Their continuance here may be traced with certainty from the time of Henry the Third to that of Charles the Second, when Sir Aston Cokayne, the celebrated Poet, who was a considerable sufferer for his loyalty to Charles the First, gave the finishing blow to the ruin of an old and venerable inheritance (which began to decline in the reign of James) by selling this seat and estate to Sir William Boothby, bart. The present mansion has been erected at different periods, and is not possessed externally of any architectural beauties. The ancient part is castellated, and the later additions to it are in the modern style of architecture. The situation of the house is on rising ground, on the north bank of the little river Schoo, or Henmore. The views from the house and grounds extend over a pic turesque and beautiful valley, surrounded by eminences of various heights. The park and gardens are laid out with great taste. The interior of the house is also fitted up and disposed with taste and elegance. The library, comprising upwards of six thousand volumes, is a choice collection of classic and polite literature. The principal rooms are ornamented by a valuable collection of paintings by the first masters, many of them being from the collection of his Royal Highness, the late Duke of York, who was a particular friend ofthe late Sir Brooke Boothby, bart.

'"], [67, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 45 The name and family of Boothby are of great antiquity, and may be traced to an era before the conquest. Sir William Dugdale, an antiquarian of high authority, observes in his Origines Judiciales, chap. ix. p. 22, that Egbert, about 800, divided the nation into counties, hundreds and wapentakes, and we find one ofthe wapentakes of Lincolnshire called Boothby. There are also in the same county a market-town named Boothby Paynell, and an old manor-house of the same appellation. These are said, by Camden, to have received this name from the Boothby family, who resided there. The same observation is made by the ancient historian Leland. In the additions to Camden, by Mr. E. Wilson, we find it asserted that the heir general of Boothby married Paynell, Lord of Bampton, in the county of Devon. The same coat of arms as is now borne by the Boothbys was lately to be found painted on the glass windows in the church and in the ancient hall at that place. The lineal succession of a family of so ancient a standing cannot easily be traced through the earliest generations; but we find that Adam de Boothby was abbot of Peterborough in 1321. Theobaldus de Boothby was governor of Pontefract castle, in York shire, which he held a long time against the Lancastrians during the civil war ofthe Roses. Lady Corbett, mother of the first named Sir Henry Boothby, by her prudent management left to her said son an estate in London, another, called Kingsland, in Middlesex; Clatercote, Claden, and the manor of Cropperdy, in Oxfordshire ; Broadlow Ash, Cold Eaton, and land thereto be longing, near Ashbourn, in Derbyshire; Kings Mills, and one half of the manor or park of Cheadle, with Longnor, and other estates in Staffordshire. Sir William Brooke, father of Lady Boothby, by his wife Penelope Hill, daughter of Sir Miles Hill, ancestor ofthe Marquess of Downshire, was nephew and heir male of Henry Brooke, the last Lord Cobham, of Cobham hall, county of Kent, who was concerned in the Raleigh plot. He was tried with Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the time of James the First, and attainted, and his large estates forfeited to the crown. His life was spared, but he was confined in the Tower, and died there in great want. In the time of Charles the First, the attainder was reversed by Act of Parliament, but the title not to be assumed but by the special grace of the king. Charles II. by special patent, 1665, granted that the daughters of Sir William Brooke, male heir of the Lord Cobham, viz. Lady Boothby, Lady Denham, and Lady Whitmore, should have place and precedency due to the daughters of Barons. \u2014 George Brooke, brother ofthe above Lord Cobham, and father of Sir William Brooke, was beheaded for his concern in the conspiracy in question. He married the eldest daughter and co-heiress ofthe last Lord de Burgh, or Borough, who died without male issue, in the reign of Elizabeth. This is also, as well as that of Cobham, a barony in fee. The late Sir Brooke Boothby, bart. was an eminent scholar and a great encourager of litera ture and the fine arts. He was a poet and a political writer of distinction ; his most celebrated political pamphlet was his reply to Burke. This baronet composed the epitaphs in Ashbourn church, to his daughter, his sister, his father and mother, and his aunt. During his travels abroad, in 1803, he purchased from Herckenrode Abbey, in Germany, the splendidly painted glass windows that now adorn the eastern ends of the aisles, and the Dean's consistory court, in Lichfield cathedral. These are supposed to be the finest specimens now in England ; and in point of drawing and execution reflect credit on the German artist. The following inscription, written by Dr. Parr, commemorates the acquisition of this treasure through the generous exertions of the above named Sir Brooke. Above the inscription are the arms of Boothby. QVAE . IN . APSIDA . VICINA . INSVNT SEPTEM . FENESTRAE . PICTVRATAE COENOBIO . CANONICARVM . HERCHENRODENSI QVOD . OLIM . EXORNAVERANT FOEDISSIME .

Sir William Boothby, the present baronet, succeeded his father (who only enjoyed the title six weeks) and has chiefly resided at his seat at Ashbourn, and by the urbanity of his manners, by his usefulness and integrity as a magistrate, and by his attention to the interests of the town over which he is lord, has gained the universal esteem and good wishes of his neighbours. Lady Boothby and her daughters are great benefactors to the poor of Ashbourn. Pedigree of BERESFORD, of Bentley, Newton Grange, Ashbourn, iyc. iyc. ARMS.

The other distinguished individuals and their alliances are mentioned in the table Pedigree."], [77, "55 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. ASHFORD-IN-THE- WATER, li m. N. W. from Bakewell, a village, parochial chapelry, Aisseford, constablery and township, in the archdeaconry of Derby and hundred of High Peak, contained in 1821, 147 houses, 147 families and 728 inhabitants. Of the 147 families, 35 are chiefly employed in agriculture, 56 in trade, manufacture or handicraft, and 56 in the mines, professional pursuits, or are living independent. The village of Ashford is situate in a deep and fertile valley on the banks of the Wye ; it may, says a modern writer, be pro nounced the most pleasant and agreeable village in the High Peak. Wood and water, rock and meadow, buildings and gardens, promiscuously mixed, form at once a scene both interesting, fascinating and picturesque. This township consists of 2505 a. 2 r. 35 p. of excellent limestone land, which is generally termed the Garden of the Peak: and roads 56 a. 2 r. 18 p. The esti mated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a33175. 11*. 2d. The average parochial ex penses for 8 years, including poor rates, county rates and constables' accounts, amount to \u00a3453. 8*. 2d. per annum. The church rates and highways are collected separately. This township joins Middleton house of industry ; the pauper children are apprenticed in general to trades. The land is let in large and small farms ; the tithes belong to the Duke of Devonshire, and the rate is annually fixed. The land is principally copyhold, viz. 850 a. 3 r. 8 p. and there are many copyholders. The freeholders are the Duke of Devonshire (whose estate here is 1654 a. 3 r. 27 p) James Green, esq. the executors of the late Robert Needham, esq. Joseph Bretnor, Mrs. White, &c. The Duke of Devonshire holds a copyhold court and a mineral court twice a year. John Charge, esq. Clerk of the Peace, is the steward. There are two sick clubs in this village, the men's consisting of 104, and the women's of about 80 members. There is a parochial day school endowed, a Baptist and a Unitarian chapel, three innkeepers and two county bridges in this township. At the top of Finn-Head are the remains of an old encampment. The wakes are held the last Sunday in May. The marble-works established here in 1748, were the first of the kind constructed in England for sawing and polishing marble. This ingenious machine was invented by Mr. Henry Watson, of Bakewell ; but the invention did not, in point of profit, answer the expectation of the inventor. The works are now carried on, to a considerable extent, by Mr. Brown, of Derby. The marble which is here manufactured into chimney-pieces, vases, ornaments, &c. is the production of this neighbourhood, and is equal in quality and beauty to any in the world: consequently, it is in great request in this kingdom, and finds a ready market in distant countries. The black marble takes so fine a polish that the slabs have the appearance of looking-glasses. The grey is full of sea-shells and entrochites, similar to those found in some parts of Sussex. The machinery for polishing the marble is somewhat similar in construction to that used in the marble and spar- works at Derby, but it is worked by water. One part, called the sweeping-mill, from its circular motion, is also different ; by this a floor, containing 80 superficial feet of marble, is levelled at the same time. Stockings are also manufactured here, in which branch from seventy to eighty frames are employed, and a few hands go to the Bakewell cotton mill. In Aisseford, with the berewicks Ralunt, Langesdune, Heteshope, Calvoure, Basselawe, Bubene, Bircelcs, Scelhardan, Tandintune, Flagun, Presteclive, Blackewelle, king Edward had twenty-two carucates of land to be taxed and one carucale of land untaxed. The king now has there in demesne four ploughs, and eighteen villanes have five ploughs. Land to twenty-two ploughs. There is one mill of 12d. and the site of one mill and one lead mine, and 40 acres of meadow. Wood not pasture, two miles long and two broad. D. B. 294. This manor was parcel of the ancient demesnes of the crown. It was granted to Wenunwen, lord of Powisland, by king John, in the first year of his reign. In 1250, Griffin, the son of lord Powisland, had a grant of free warren in this manor. In 1319, Edward II. granted it to his brother, Edmund Plantagenet, earl of Kent. Joan, his daughter, and eventually heiress, married to her second husband Sir Thomas Holland, and brought this manor into that family. In 1408, on the death of Edmund Holland, earl of Kent, it became the property of his sister and co- heiress, the wife of John, lord Neville. In 1549 or 1550, Henry Neville, earl of Westmoreland,"], [78, "56 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER sold it to Sir William Cavendish, and it still continues in the Cavendish family, being the proper ty of the Duke of Devonshire. Here Edward Plantagenet of Woodstock, earl of Kent, and after him the Hollands, earls of Kent, and more recently the NeviUes, earls of Westmoreland, had a residence, of which the only vestio-e now remaining is the moat, which formerly surrounded the castle. It is not known when or by whom the castle was built, or when it was destroyed. The neat tower church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, has been for the most part rebuilt. In the south wall is inserted a part of the old porch, on which is sculptured a wild boar, and another animal something resembling a wolf, in a couchant posture, under a tree, which is thought to be allegorical of the ancient Peak forest, it being infested with those animals at the time the church was erected. In the interior of the church there are some curious garlands, that have been car ried at various times before young unmarried people at their funerals. The living, a curacy, in the peculiar of Bakewell, is valued in the king's books at \u00a32. Is. in the gift of the vicar of Bakewell. The Rev. John Browne, of Bakewell, is the present incumbent. The living has been increased by \u00a3400. subscribed, royal bounty \u00a3600. and a parliamentary grant of \u00a3200. The present value is about \u00a3150. per annum.

The estimated annual value of the buildings and land is \u00a31533. ; the average of seven years' poor, church, constable and county rates is \u00a3210. per annum. The tithes are the property of the Dean of Lincoln. G. H. Errington, esq. is the lessee, who re-lets them to Francis Hurt, esq. There is a Wesleyan Methodist chapel in this village. This township is part of the manor of Alderwasley, and Francis Hurt, esq. is lord. There is considerable copyhold property within this manor, and which is held of the lord at an uncertain fine. James Milnes, of Matlock, esq. is the steward of the court. ASHOPTON, a small village in the vale of the river Ashop, and chapelry of Derwent. Ashopton inn, which has recently been built by the Duke of Devonshire, for the accommodation of the new line of road between Sheffield and Manchester, is an excellent house. A wool fair was held at this inn the last Wednesday in July, 1829, and has since been continued. ASHOVER, an ancient market-town, township, constablery and extensive parish, seated in a Esseover, narrow valley, and surrounded by high hills, 6^ m. N. W. by N. from Alfreton, 6 m. S. W. from Chesterfield, 7 m. N. E. from Wirksworth, and 21 m. N. of Derby, is in the hun dreds of Scarsdale and Wirksworth, and deanery of Chesterfield. The township of Ashover in cludes the following villages and places : Alton, Butterley, High Oredish, Kelstedge, Milntown, Northedge, Littlemoor, Fall Gate, Raven's Nest, Green House, Gorse Hall, Hatch Lees, East wood, Butts, Rattle, Marsh Green, Hardwick, Brocklehurst, Upper Town, Bunting Field, Dick Lant, Hay, Stubbing Edge, Nutting Field, Spite Winter, Edlestow, and Overton and Slack, in the Scarsdale hundred. Containing 500 houses, 505 families, and 2,506 inhabitants. The chapelry of Dethicke, and constablery and township of Dethicke, Lea and Holloway are in the parish of Ashover, and hundred of Wirksworth, and contain 88 houses, 108 families, and 492 inhabitants. Of the 613 families in this parish 324 are chiefly employed in agriculture, and 173 in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, the remaining 116 are employed in the mines, in professional pur suits, or live independent. The manufactures are principally carried on at Kelstedge and Lea ; these are spinning of flax and wool, making of hats, framework-knitting, and smelting of lead ore. The township of Ashover is in length, from Brackenfield to Beeley common, 6 miles 6 chains ; i"], [80, "58 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER in breadth, from North Winfield to Tansley, 3^ miles 3 chains; and comprises 8831 acres of gritstone, limestone, toadstone, and coal land, of various qualities. There is a small proportion of what the farmers term deaf land, consisting of a black earth, underneath which is a red or fox coloured sand. This land, when pared and burnt, will scarcely carry a crop of oats. The average rental is about 20*. per acre. The township is well watered by the river Amber, which rises in it, and numerous springs. It is divided among about eighty freeholders. The lords of the manor at the time of the enclosure of the common, in 1 779. were the Duke of Devon shire, Sir Henry Hunloke, Sir Thomas George Skipwith, barts. as devisees in trust, Robert Banks Hodgkinson, John Woodyeare, the Rev. Laurence Bourne, John Bourne of Hull, John Bourne of Spital, and Sarah Bower ; at which time a certain quantity of the common land was allotted to the rector in lieu of the ancient moduses for tithe hay, and also for the tithe of all sorts and kinds of hay growing upon the said common or waste grounds. The estimated value of all the lands and buildings in the township of Ashover is \u00a38447. 3s. per annum, on which sum l\\d. in the pound is paid for the county rate. The average of eight years for the poor, county rate, and constables' accounts, is \u00a31364. Os. id. and church rate, \u00a362. per annum. The corn tithes alone may average about \u00a3450. or \u00a3500. per annum. There are a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, one endowed free-school, one Sunday school, sup ported by voluntary contribution, four friendly societies, consisting of between 400 and 500 members, and twelve public houses in the township. The market day was formerly held on Thursday, but we believe it is now discontinued. The fairs are held on April 25, and October 1 5, for horses and horned cattle. In the year 1767 the principal tenants in Ashover, Matlock and Darley, came to a resolution to convert a building, which had been erected nearly fifty years before for a bathing house, but which had fallen into decay, into a subscription poor house. The building was large, and con sisted of several tenements, which, with some alterations, seemed to be well adapted for their benevolent purpose. It was determined that this Ashover poor-house should be under the management of three Directors and a Treasurer, chosen every four years from among the inhabi tants of Ashover and three adjoining parishes. The parish officers of all the districts around were invited, by a printed list of rules, to subscribe, and to send paupers to be lodged, fed, clothed, &c. These subscribing parishes were to pay quarterly their quota, in proportion to the whole num ber of parishes, towards the rent, salary, cost of utensils and repairs ; and to pay monthly for each pauper, in proportion to the whole current expenses for the maintenance of the paupers on the establishment. The scheme was well approved : many adjacent parishes soon subscribed, and were followed by others. The following is a list of the present subscribing parishes : Ashover, Eckington, Matlock, Ripley, Baslow, Edensor, Middleton, Shirland, Beighton, Glapwell, Newbold, Shottle, Bolsover, Hasland, Normanton, South, Scarcliff, Brampton, Horsley, Norton, Smalley, Chester, Little, Horsley Woodhouse, Pilsley, Stretton, Cromford, Kilburn, Pentrich, Sutton, Darley, Killamarsh, Pinxton, Tibshelf, Dronfield, Longstone, Tupton, Unstone, Walton, Wensley, Whittington, William thorpe, Winfield, South, Wingerworth. In 1809 the number of subscribing parishes were 61, and at that period the paupers were 38 in number ; at present the subscribing parishes to the Ashover division are 43, and the paupers averaged last year 6l. The cost of maintenance per annum was at the former period about \u00a310. 8*. per head, and last year (1828-9) the average maintenance was \u00a3ll. 4*."], [81, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 59 Abstract of one year's account, ending February 23, 1829- \u00a3\u25a0 s. d. \u00a3. s. d.

It is romantically situate in a deep but narrow valley, which is watered by a branch of the little river Amber ; and, ap proached from the Matlock road, its appearance is strikingly beautiful. The light spire of the church rises gracefully from the surrounding trees, and is a pleasing feature in every view that is obtained of the village. The hills are lofty and picturesque : in some places barren rocks break through the soil; in others they crust the summits, and trees and houses are scattered amongst projecting crags and verdant slopes.\" Leonard Wheatcroft, clerk of the parish, poet, tailor and schoolmaster, wrote a book about the year 1722, in which he gives the following description of Ashover: he says, \"Few villages are better situated for excellent water. The river Amber rises in this parish, and bears that name for ten miles, besides eighty springs. A very good cold bath for rich as well as poor to bathe in for recreation, and to cure their bodies of several distempers. Four spacious commons well furnish ed with all sorts of moor-game, besides foxes, hares and the like; and ten fair woods.\" The curious manuscript book, from which the above is extracted, is in the possession of William Milnes, of Stubbing Edge, esq. In Esseover, Leuric and Levenot had two carucates of land to be taxed. Land to two ploughs. Three farmers and fourteen bordars have three ploughs. There is now in the demesne one plough, and a priest, a church, and one mill of 1 6d. Wood pasture two miles loug and two miles broad. Falue in king Edward's time \u00a3i. now 30s. Serlo holds it. D. B. 318. The Leuric and Levenot mentioned in this extract are supposed to have been sons of Earl Godwin. At the Survey it was held by Serlo, under Ralph Fitzhubert. In 1203 the co- heiresses espoused a Willoughby, of Lincolnshire, and a Deincourt ; the co-heiresses of the latter married Revesby, of Lincolnshire, and Musters, of Nottinghamshire ; and it appears that, in the reign of Edward I. the manor was divided into three shares : viz. the New hall, and Old hall or Revesbys and Musters, and Perpoynts' manors. The latter was afterwards called the Babington, or Gorse hall manor. The New hall manor, with the advowson of the church, remained in the descendants of Adam de Revesby (who occasionally served the office of sheriff for the county) till the trustees of Sir Thomas Revesby sold it, in 1623, to the Rev. Emanuel Bourne, then rector of Ashover. In 1 797 the Rev. Lawrence Bourne bequeathed it to his niece, Jemima, the late wife of Mr. John Nodder, and her children, in whom it is now vested. The Eastwood estate belongs to William Milnes, esq. with the exception of the site of the hall, and a small portion of land, which was sold, in 1762, to the governors of Queen Anne's bounty, for the purpose of augment ing the chapel of Brimington, near Chesterfield. Three-fourths of the Old hall manor was conveyed by Ralph de Revesby in 1337, and one fourth, which had belonged to the Musters, to Roger, son of Robert de Wynfield, of Edlestow hall. This manor passed by marriage to Robert Plumley, who dying without issue, it became the property of James Rolleston, of Lea, whose great grandfather had married a daughter of Roger de Wynfield. The manors of Ashover and Lea, belonging to the Rollestons, passed by"], [82, "HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 60 marriage, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, to the Pershalls, of Horsley, in Staffordshire. In 1 648 Sir John Pershall, bart. sold them to Richard Hodgkinson, and Giles Cowley. Revesby manor was re-sold by them, and became the property of the Bournes, the Marchioness of Ormond as representative of the Clarkes, and the late Sir Joseph Banks through the Hodgkinsons. Edles tow hall was purchased, in 1808, by Mr. John Milnes, ofthe widow ofthe Rev. John Bourne, of Spital, who obtained it through the Gladwins. The Perpoynts' share of the original estate be came the property of the Babingtons, of Dethicke, who sold it to Sir Thomas Revesby, and it passed with his other estates in Ashover, by sale : viz. three- sevenths to the late Sir Joseph Banks, now the property of William Milnes, esq. one-seventh to the Duke of Devonshire, one seventh to Sir Henry Hunloke, bart. one-seventh to the representatives of the late John Wood yeare, esq. of Crookhill, and the remaining seventh in severalties. The hall is the property of Samuel Dutton, of Chesterfield, esq. and it is tenanted by a farmer. Overton, in this parish, was long the property of a family named Le Hunt. It passed from them, in 1556, and was sold in severalties, a portion of which became the property ofthe Hodg kinsons, about 1680, and subsequently, passed by marriage to the late Sir Joseph Banks. On the death of Lady Banks, in 1828, the Overton estate became the property of Sir E. Knatchbull, bart. who disposed of it to William Milnes, of Stubbing-Edge, esq. and to Dr. John Bright, of Manchester Square, London. The Stubbing-Edge estate formerly belonged to the family of Crich. In the reign of Eliza beth, we find it belonging to Richard Dakeyne, who married Catherine, a Scottish lady,* called Shang, or Strange, one of the favourite attendants of Mary, Queen of Scots. This estate, after having passed through various hands, became the property of William Milnes, esq. The North edge estate is much divided. The ancient halls in this parish were Edlestow, Eastwood (now in ruins) Gorse, Clattercoats, Overton, Stubbing-Edge, and Old hall. These have been occupied by many opulent families: viz. the Rollestons, Revesbys, Criches, Dakeynes, Babingtons, Hunts, Wynfields, Hodgkinsons, the late Sir Joseph Banks, t Bournes, Gladwins, Milnes, &c. In the reign of Edward I. Adam de Revesby, Ralph de Revesby, Robert Perpoynt, and Henry Musters, were stated to be separate lords of the manor. In 1530, the Babingtons, Rollestons, and Revesbys were the lords. The present lords ofthe manor are, William Milnes, esq. (whose estate here is about 1600 acres) John Bright, esq. M. D. the Rev. Joseph Nodder, the Rev. Law rence Short, Samuel Dutton, esq. and others. At the time that Doomsday Book was compiled, there appear to have been a church and a priest at Ashover. The present church is a gothic building, with a handsome spire. About the begin ning of the last century a portion of the spire was blown down and re-built. Wheatcroft says, that the original spire was built about the year 1419, and that it was one hundred feet high. This edifice had originally twenty-four handsome windows, ornamented with figures and arms in stained glass. The advowson ofthe church was given by Robert, Earl Ferrers, in the reign of king Stephen, to the abbot and convent of Darley. In 1302 it was purchased by the Revesbys. 19 Jac. I. Sir Thomas Revesby, of Thriberg, in the county of York, bart. demised the manor of Ashover, the advowson ofthe church, and lands in Ashover, Eastwood, Milltown, Nutting Field, North-Edge &c. in the county of Derby, by way of mortgage to Samuel Tryon, of London, merchant (after wards created a baronet) for a term of two hundred years, in consideration of \u00a3 1123. 6s. Sd. * Wolley, in his manuscript, says she was the daughter of Patrick Shang, of Edinburg, gent. ; but authors gener ally term her the daughter of the Earl of Rothes. It is certain that one of the last requests of that unhappy princess to Elizabeth was, that she would be the friend of this her most affectionate attendant. -)- Sir Joseph Banks descended from an ancient family of Yorkshire, and one of his majesty's honourable privy council, was born in 1743, created a baronet in 1781, and died in 1820, after having filled the offices of President of the Royal Society, and Recorder of the borough of Boston. He sailed round the world with the celebrated Captain Cook, and distinguished himself by his attachment to the study of Natural History. He .was a great patron of the Arts, and died universally respected."], [83, "61 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. which not being paid, in chancery, Mich, term, 21 Jac.

And of both terms for two thousand and two hundred years, for and towards the said portions. It was afterwards purchased by the Bournes, and the advowson of the living is now the property ofthe Nodders. The church, dedicated to All Saints, is a pleasing object in the landscape when viewed from the surrounding hills. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a324. 3s. l^d. and yearly tenths \u00a32. Ss. 3\\d. : the present yearly value of the living is estimated at \u00a3600. The glebe is about 30 acres. The Rev. Lawrence Short is the present incumbent. In 1511, a chantry chapel was founded by Thomas Babington in this church. The lands be longing to it were valued, in 1547, at \u00a35. 0*. id. per annum. In the church is a very ancient font, by some imagined to be Saxon ; the base is of stone ; the lower part is of an hexagonal form, the upper part circular, and surrounded by twenty figures, in devotional attitudes, clothed in loose flowing drapery, embossed in lead, which stand in orna mental niches, as represented in the annexed engraving.

We cannot, however, with accuracy, carry up the pedigree further than to James, who purchased the Butts in l6'9si. His great grandsons, William and John, have added to the family estate by entering into several mining speculations. Mr. John Milnes having for many years turned his attention to the minerals of the county, and being an excellent geologist, has employed his active mind in exploring and laying down the stratification of the mountains by which his residence is surrounded. His laudable exertions will tend to benefit future speculators in mining. His younger brother, James, settled in America, and died there in 1814, leaving three surviving sons, officers in the army and navy, and one daughter. The Messrs. Milnes, of Ashover, are considerable lead smelters, and have for many years employed a large capital in that business. James Milnes, the grandson of the first James named in the pedigree, settled at Mansfield, and his eldest son, James, seated himself at Windsor. There he accumulated a good fortune by his assiduity in business ; became an alderman, and served the office of mayor several times for that place. He was much noticed by the royal family, several of whom honoured him by being sponsors to his children. His younger brother, who resided at Mansfield, died in the prime of life, leaving issue two sons and four daughters, as shown in the pedigree. ASTON is a small rural village, township, constabulary and parish, 1 m. E. of Weston-upon Easton' Trent and 6 m. S. of Derby, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch and deanery East-town, of Derby. This parish includes the hamlets of Shardlow and Great Wilne, which K"], [90, "66 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER form a united township and constabulary, and maintain their own poor ; it is about three miles m length and two miles in breadth, and the grand-trunk canal runs through the parish. The town ship of Aston contains 116 houses, 121 families, and 552 inhabitants. Of the 121 families, 6i are chiefly employed in agriculture, 41 in trade or handicraft, and 16 on the grand-trunk canal or living independent. The population is increasing; the baptisms from 1821 to 1828 inclusive, were 211 males, 222 females; burials, 89 males, 108 females, making an increase of 236 persons in eight years. The township contains 1763 acres of excellent land, tithe free, about one-third of which is arable, and two-thirds meadow and pasture : some is let for \u00a33. an acre, but the average is about \u00a32. per acre : it is divided among eight proprietors, viz : Edward Shuttleworth Holden, esq. the Earl of Harrington, the Rev. N. P. Johnson, the Rev. Joseph Sykes, of Newark, James Sutton, esq. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Joseph Botham, and Mr. Thomas Hickenbotham. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a33310. 9s. 2d. The average parochial expenses of seven years for the poor, county rate and constables' accounts, amount to \u00a3280. 6s. 3d. per an num. This township is bounded on the S. by the Trent and Shardlow, on the W. by Weston, on the N. and N. E. by Elvaston and the Derwent. There is no endowed school in this village, but a school-house is provided by the rector for a day and Sunday school for the whole ofthe poor children ; about forty of each sex are instructed therein, and they are supported by voluntary contribution. There are three male and one female friendly societies, a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, two lace-machines, a few stocking-frames, and two public houses in this township. In \u00c6slune and Scerdclau there were six ox-gangs of land and a half lo be taxed. There was one plough in the demesne, and four villanes and two bordars had one plough and four acres of meadow. Uctebrand held it of the king. It was then worth 5s. In Estune, Levenot had two carucates of land to be. taxed. Land lo two ploughs.

The abbot of Chester held the whole of this village as the free gift of Ilrig, earl of Chester. By the charter of Robert de Ferrariis, jun. earl of Derby, two parts ofthe lordship and tithe of Aston were given to the priory of Tutbury, in the county of Stafford. In 29 Edward I. Thomas de Cadurcis, alias Chaworth, held the village of Aston. In the reign of Richard II. the abbot of Dale had an estate here. In the time of Henry VII. Ralph Sacheverell died, and left an estate here to his grandson Henry. After the Reformation, the manor of Aston, as parcel of Weston cum membris, was granted to Sir William Paget, and afterwards passed to the Ropers. About this period, Christopher Hunt, esq. died, and left a capital messuage, and several others, to his son Thomas. In 2 Edward VI. Rowland Babington, of Derby, died, and left his son Francis an estate here. In 5 and 6 Philip and Mary, Sir Henry Sacheverell died, and left his estate here to his son John. In l(i Elizabeth, Sir Richard Harpur, chief justice of the court of King's Bench, died, and left his son John an estate here. In 3.5 Elizabeth, John Sacheverell died, and left his son Henry his estate here. In 16-19; Robert Holden, esq. (who had previously purchased the capital mansion and estate which belonged to the ancient family of Hunts, formerly of Overton in Ashover, and afterwards of Aston) purchased that part of Aston which had belonged to the Roper family. Robert Holden, esq. who died in 17*6, left an only daughter and heiress who married James Shuttleworth, esq. whose fourth son, the late Rev. Charles Shuttleworth, on suc ceeding by bequest to the manor of Weston, &c. took the name of Holden. Mr. Holden also possessed the manor of Shardlow, purchased of the Hunts. These are now the property of his son, E. S. Holden, esq. A market at Aston on Tuesday, and a fair for three days at the festival of St. Peter ad vincula"], [91, "67 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. both long ago discontinued, were granted in the year 1256 to the abbot of Chester, who held the manor and church under the earl of Chester, and afterwards under the earls and dukes of Lancaster. The market cross still remains, and near to it the stocks are placed for the pun ishment of offenders. The church, dedicated to All Saints, is an ancient gothic building with a square tower. The roof is supported by round Saxon columns, and the font is handsome. In 1 393, it was appropri. ated to the abbey of St. Werburgh's, in Chester. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a329. 15*. and yearly tenths \u00a32. 19*. 6d. There are now 450 acres of glebe land, and the great and small tithes of about 240 acres of land in Shardlow and Wilne township. The pre sent value is estimated at \u00a31350. per annum. The advowson has been vested in the Holden family more than a century. The Rev. N. P. Johnson is the present incumbent. The gallery was erected by the company of proprietors of the navigation from the Trent to the Mersey, in 1788. Arms and Monumental Inscriptions in the Church.

BAKEWELL. The antiquity of the town of Bakewell may be traced to a very early period. Badecanwillan, It is first mentioned in history shortly after the termination of the heptarchy. Bauquelle,' The parish of which this town is the head is extensive and populous, but the town itself is not large. It stands in the hundred of High Peak, and is de lightfully situate on the western bank of the Wye. It is 12 m. W. of Chesterfield; 12 m. S. of Buxton \u2022 1 6 m. S. W. of Sheffield \u2022 10 m. N. W. of Matlock ; 12 m. N. W. of Wirksworth ; 27 m. N. W. of Derby ; and 152 m. N. N. W. of London. Bakewell is a market-town, a township, a constabulary, and parish, and is esteemed to be the chief town of the High Peak hundred, and in the archdeaconry of Derby. The population con sists of about 1900 inhabitants, residing in about 360 houses. Of this population there are 54"], [97, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 73 families employed at the cotton factory; 37 individuals are shoemakers; 18 blacksmiths; 21 joiners and cabinet makers ; 9 carpenters; 12 are employed at the marble works ; and the rest are chiefly engaged in agriculture, mining, chertstone getting, (of which large quantities are sent to the Staffordshire potteries,) professional pursuits, or are living independent. The market-day is held on Friday, and a fat cattle market every Monday fortnight. The market place is one of the most complete in the county. The following fairs are held, for horses, cattle, &c. on Easter-Monday, Whit-Monday, 26th of August, the first Monday after the 20th of October, and the 11th of November. Races were held in Bakewell, 1726 and 1730, when there were two stakes run for of \u00a320. and The sessions formerly held at Bakewell, were removed in 1797, in consequence of the dis turbances created at the time the supplementary militia was about being raised.

Of the 1695 families, 662 are chiefly employed in agriculture, 590 in trade or handicraft, and 443 in mining, limestone getting and burning, in gentlemen's service, professional pursuits, or are living independent. , The basis of the land, which consists of 2992 acres, is limestone. The quality is good, and about 400 acres are planted: one-fourth of the remainder is arable, and there are nearly 2100 acres of meadow and pasture land. The average rental per acre is about 35s. The farms are not large ; none of them exceeding 300 acres. The average annual amount of the poors' rate is \u00a3520. That of the county rates amount to \u00a3 134.

The paupers are generally maintained at their respective abodes, except a few that are sent to the House of Industry at Chapel-en-le-Frith: to which the inhabitants subscribe, and the pauper children are apprenticed to trades. Between the gritstone and limestone strata which surround the town, and constitute much of the subsoil of the parish, there is a deep bed of shale, which, being of an argillaceous nature and retentive of moisture, forms excellent pasture land.* The whole extent of the parish is in length from N. W. to S. E. more than twenty miles, and its average breadth exceeds eight. The com mons about Bakewell and Over Haddon were formerly one continued dreary waste, but now they present a scene of enclosures interspersed very tastefully with wide spreading plantations, be longing to the Duke of Rutland. Here we behold a smiling change of scene, Where earth-born russet yields to lively green ; Rich pastures rise where deserts spread before, And barren wastes recruit the less'ning store. The township of Bakewell is divided among 53 resident, and 1 7 non-resident freeholders. The Duke of Rutland is the largest proprietor. His Grace's estate here being 1 823 acres, and a great part of the buildings in the town ; and, as lord of the manor, his Grace holds a court annually in the town. Petty sessions are also held on the first and third Fridays of every month, by the county magistrates in the neighbourhood. There are two chapels ; one belonging to the Wesleyan Methodists, and the other to the In dependents. There are three Sunday schools, supported by voluntary contribution, in which about 300 children of both sexes are instructed. Of Friendly Societies there are two for men and one for women, they consist altogether of 450 members. In the township there are eight public houses ; and two county bridges. The houses are built of lime or gritstone, obtained in the neighbourhood. The black marble quarries in the neighbourhood, belonging to the Duke of Rutland, produce blocks of the finest quality, which are here sawn and polished for various uses, and exported to all parts of the world. Under the munificent care of the present illustrious possessor, the town of Bakewell has been greatly improved. The bath over the chalybeate tonic spring is elegant and commodious. The excellent inn, the beauties of the surrounding country, the clear trout streams, the great thoroughfare, and the interesting objects in the immediate vicinity have become the resort of nu merous visitors. The permission to fish in the beautiful and romantic river Wye, which flows past the western skirts of the town, is generously granted by his Grace of Rutland to the fre quenters of the bath and the neighbouring inn, now kept by Mr. and Mrs. Greaves. The ancient bath, from which the town derives its name, and which is supposed to have been in use, and to have obtained celebrity during a long period previously to the time of Edward the Elder, is now in the possession of the ingenious and intelligent Mr. White Watson, F. L. S. a gentleman highly distinguished for his geological researches, and whose collections of fossils at tracts many visitors from Matlock and Buxton. * Two miles from Bakewell upon the top of a hill, is a piece of ground of this strange nature : it is a field which for the most part, has very good grass in it ; but if a horse be put in it, it will fatten him or kill him in a month's time' as the opinion prevails thereabout. Extracted from Remarks on the peculiarities and varieties of the soil in the Hisrh Peak in the Magna Britannia. \u00b0 t This rich and scientific collection merits particular attention. It is distributed into three classes 1. The productions of Derbyshire only, containing 1350 specimens of rocks, ores, crystallizations, petrifactions &c 2. Specimens of most ofthe known species of fossils, properly arranged and described after Werner. 3. Specimens of those minerals only which are employed in the arts and manufactures. The following curious relics of antiquity are also in the possession of Mr. White Watson, with many others \u2022 1. A basaltic head of an axe, found a few years since on Stanton moor. 2. A basaltic celt, discovered near Haddon hall, in November, 1795. 3. An entire urn of baked earth, found in a barrow on Stanton moor, July 15, 1799, full of burnt bone. 4 A small lamp, found in another urn, about the same time and place ; with the heads of a spear and arrow of flint, which were among the burnt bones contained in the urn. P '"], [99, "75 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. The waters of Bakewell were certainly known to the Romans. The Saxon name Baddecanwell, is derived from the baths. The tepid chalybeate spring does not exceed 59 or 60\u00b0. The water, which was analysed by the late C. Sylvester, is recommended as a tonic, and as a bath for chronic rheumatism. A large bathing house was erected over this spring in 1697- It has been re-opened by the directions of the Duke of Rutland. Two shower-baths of different powers have been added, and a news room has been established on the same premises. The water of this spring was found to contain, in 10 quarts, wine measure, 75 grains of crystallized sulphate of lime, 20 grains super carbonate of lime, 22 grains crystallized sulphate of magnesia, 1 '6 grain muriate of magnesia, 31 grains super-carbonate of iron; in all 121-7 grains. Another spring at Bakewell has been found to contain in siO quarts, 13 cubic inches of sulphurated hydrogen, but a complete analysis has not yet, we believe, been effected. The temperature is the same as common water, and its medicinal qualities resemble those ofthe spring at Kedleston. In Badeqttelle, with eight berewicks, king Edward had three carucates of land lo be taxed. Land lo eighteen ploughs, and thirty-three villanes and nine bordars. There are two priests and a church, and under them two villanes and five bordars ; all these having eleven ploughs. There is one knight having sixteen acres of land, and one lead mine, and eighty acres of meadow. Coppice-wood one mile long and one broad. Three carucates of that land belong to the church. Henry de Ferrieres claims one carucate in Hadune. These are berewicks cf this manor : Hadune, Holun, Reuslcy, Bertun, Cranchesberie, Ancise, Mancis, and Haduna. D. B. 294. In the Test, de Neville, p. 17, there is a passage, mentioning Bakewell, which may be thus translated : \" The town of Bakewell is in the donation of our Lord the King ; and Ralph Gernun holds it by the gift of king Richard, and it is worth, per annum, \u00a3l6. From the Calend. Iitquis. Post Mort. it appears that, in the time of Edward I. William de Gernun held Bakewell as a feoff ment of the honour of Peverel of Nottingham. Brown Willis, esq. in the Notitia Parliamentaria, says, Bakewell hath more plain signs of being a borough town than Chesterfield. The Saxons call it Baddecanwell, it is probable from the baths, for the Saxons call baths bade and baden (as the Germans do at this day). Marianus tells us, that king Edward the Elder made this place a borough. That Bakewell was a place of repute at a very ancient period there can be little doubt, and, accordingly we find, that it was one of the positions chosen by Edward the Elder for a military post to overawe the disaffected Mercians, who reluctantly submitted to the throne of Wessex, and among whom even the Danes appear to have had many partisans. It was after Edward had de prived Elvina, the daughter of his heroic sister Ethelfleda, of the Mercian government, that he fortified Nottingham, and marched from that town to Bakewell, near to which he raised extensive ramparts,* the mounds of which can be traced at present, in the neighbouring meadows, one of which is called Castle-Field, and others are named Warden Close, Court- Yard, and Garlands Close, and made it the seat of jurisdiction for the High Peak hundred. This domain formed part of the territory bestowed by William the Conqueror, on his natural son William de Peverel, whose immediate descendant gave two parts ofthe tithe of the demesne of Bakewell to the monastery of Lenton in Nottinghamshire. In 1 Edward II. Robert Joice of Burton left fourteen messuages and fourteen virgates of land to his son Richard, and his male 5.

A square tile, on which the letters of the alphabet are impressed in Saxon characters. \u25a0 On the left hand of the bridle road from Bakewell to Chatsworth, there is a square plot in a pasture, with a tu mulus in it, which is hollow at the top, with a few thorns growing on its sides. This was part of the rampart built by Edward the Elder, A. D. 924, which was of great extent as appears by foundations occasionally discovered, but there is not a stone of it to be seen. This tumulus is called Castle-hill, and near it was recently found a copper bolt head, covered with green rust. This is imagined to have been an instrument discharged from some engine The passage in the Saxon Chronicles, merely states that Edward the Elder, after fortifying Nottingham, \" marched into Peak-land, to Badecanwyllan (the bathing-u-e/l) and commanded a town to be built in its neighbourhood, and to be strengthened by a garrison.\" \u2014 From this we might conclude, that there were only a few buildings previously about the bathing- well ; and that the town had its origin in this command of Edward. The supposition of Marianus Scotus and others, that Castleton was the town alluded to, is a very vague conjecture."], [100, "76 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER heirs. This manor afterwards passed to the Gernons, of Essex. In the year 1330, a claim was made by John Gernon to hold a market at Bakewell every Monday ; and it was then acknowledged that the right of holding a fair on the eve or vigil of Sts. Philip and James had been granted to William de Gemon nearly a hundred years before. The Gernons originally obtained possession of Bakewell as a donation from king John ; the estates of the Peverels having been previously forfeited. Sir John Gernon, who died in 1383, left heiresses, who married Botetourt and Peyton. The manor then passed by means of females into various families, and, in 1502, we find it in possession, by purchase, of Sir Henry Vernon. This Sir Henry was governor of Prince Arthur, son of Henry VII. who is said to have resided with him at Haddon. The Gernons had a hall or castle on the border of the moors, called Moor Hall. His Grace the Duke of Rutland, who pays a fee farm rent, is the present lord of the manor and principal proprietor of Bakewell. The church at Bakewell is chiefly of gothic architecture, and is built in the form of a cross. The octangular tower, crowned with a lofty spire, was long admired as an interesting object ; but, as the structure was supposed to have become insecure, this portion of the building was taken down in the year 1 826. Three different styles of building, distinctly exhibit the architecture to have been of different periods. The western part of the nave is plain Saxon, but at the west end there is an arch highly enriched with Saxon ornaments. All this portion of the edifice was proba bly erected before the Norman conquest, the remainder of the church seems to have been the work of the fifteenth century, with the exception of the pillars that support the tower, which are evi dently older than that period, though not so ancient as the west end of the nave. On the south side of the chancel there are three stone stalls, and a compartment for the holy water. Several stone coffins have been dug up, and in one was found a chalice which contained some coins. The church is situate on an eminence above the principal part of the town, and is dedicated to All Saints. The church has lately been enriched with eight new bells, ofthe value of \u00a3800. and an organ, the erection of which cost \u00a3300. The living is a vicarage, in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, valued in the king's books at \u00a340. and yearly tenths \u00a32. It is a peculiar in the diocess of Lichfield and Coventry. The present value is above \u00a3400. per annum. The Rev. Francis Hodgson is the present incumbent."], [101, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 77 At the Reformation, as much land and tithes were sold, by the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield as, it is computed, would now be worth \u00a33000. per annum. By the Doomsday Book, we find two priests for the parish of Bakewell. In the reign of king John, the church was granted to the canons of Lichfield ;* and in return for this grant, one of the prebendaries of that cathedral was to say mass for the soul of the king and his ancestors.t In a decree of the archbishop of Canterbury, for repairing and ornamenting chapels, belonging to parish churches, which was dated in the year 1280, complaint was made that the deacon and subdeacon of Bakewell were obliged to beg for their bread. The archbishop therefore ordered that they should eat at the table of the vicar. To provide for such an increase of expense, the vicar, who, before, had twenty marks, was ordered an additional allowance of ten marks for the support of two priests with a deacon, subdeacon and clerk at his table : and, besides, one mark annually for the deacon, and ten shillings for the subdeacon were allowed for the purchase of clothes. The archbishop also ordered that two scholastic clerks, whose occupation consisted chiefly in carrying about the holy water on the Sundays and festivals in the church and chapels of the parish, should be chosen and maintained out of the donations of the parishioners. He also insisted that the chapels of Taddington, Longstone and Baslow should be supplied by the chap ter with fit priests, and that the chapter and parishioners should contribute in equal proportions for their maintenance, each paying at the least the sum of two marks and a half. Before the Reformation, there were two chantries in Bakewell church : one at the altar of the Holy Cross, founded in 1365, by Sir Godfrey Foljambe and Avena his wife, valued at \u00a36. 6s. 2d. 1 Edward VI. ; the other at the altar ofthe Virgin Mary, valued at \u00a34. Ignorance and superstition prevailed so much in the fourteenth century, that the notion and idea of masses and prayers, as beneficial both for the living and the dead, ran very high amongst all classes of people, insomuch that charities for that purpose were founded by well disposed christians throughout the kingdom. Amongst the rest, Sh- Godfrey Foljambe, knt. then living \u2022 The following is a translation of the Grant for life of the Third Prebend in the Church of Bakewell for an angel of-gold. \" To all to whom the present letters may come ; H. by the Divine mercy, Bishop of Coventry and Dean of Lichfield, wishes health in the truth to the Chapter of this Church. All of you may have known that the Lord John, Earl of Moreton, granted in perpetuity and in pure charity, to us and to our church of Lichfield, the church of Bakewell with all belonging thereto, and that the canon Matheus, at the time of the donation, possessed the third prebend in that church ; so that we neither ought, nor are we willing to deprive him of that benefice, but we grant to him that he may possess that benefice entirely all the days of his life, on paying therefore, on the feast of St. Michael every year, to the chapter of Lichfield, one angel-of-gold, as an acknowledgment. t The church at Bakewell was given by king John to the church of St. Cedd, of Lichfield, of which gift the fol lowing is a confirmation ; Confirmatio regis Henrici III. de donatione ecclesi\u00e6 de Bathekewelle ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Cedd\u00e6 Lichf. per R.

A. D. 1371. A royal license, we must suppose, was first obtained for the purpose, in regard to the statute of Mortmain ; then he passed a grant of lands and tenements for the endowment of his chantry ; and in the third place he prescribes, by another instrument, all rules and orders concerning it, as thus : \" That Roger de Typeshelf be the first chantry priest, and he and his successors enjoy the lands. In another deed by the king's license it is settled, that he pray for the healthful estate of Sir Godfrey Foljambe* and Ann his wife, and their children, while they live, and after their decease, for their souls, and the souls of their parents, and the brotherhood of the guild of the Holy Cross at Bakewell, and all the faithful living and dead, at the altar of the Holy Cross, in the nave of the parish church, built by the said Cross ; and that the said Roger and his successors be called keepers of the said altar, and he or they cele brate mass in no other place, unless there be lawful impediment. And if the chaplain, without lawful cause abstain from celebrating mass, that another fit chaplain be admitted, at the pleasure of the vicar of Bakewell. The chaplain not to be three days away without license from the lord of Hassop for the time being, if the lord reside there, otherwise without the leave of the vicar. On a vacancy, the lord of Hassop was to present, within fifteen days, to the dean and chapter of Lichfield, and they to give institution, &c. &c.\" Brian Rowcliff was patron of this chantry 25 Henry VIII. and succeeded to it in this manner. The heiress of Foljambe, great grand-daughter ofthe founder, who died 50 Edward III. married Sir Robert Plompton, and Margaret, one ofthe two co-heirs of that family, married Sir John Rochley, of Rowcliff, who died 5 Henry VIII. and probably was father of Brian. Thomas Rawson was chantry-priest in the time of Henry VIII. when the value of this preferment was rated at \u00a34. per annum. A stone was placed over the great window of the chantry at Bakewell, in length two feet, and in breadth one foot seven inches, with the following inscription round the top or face of the stone : Dominus Thomas Rawson, A. D. MCCCCCXV. Canon S. Crucis de Bakewell. The chantry-house, erected probably about the time of Edward III. being gone to decay, Rawson made the necessary repairs, and put up this stone for a memorial thereof; it was fixed in the gable end, being the most visible place. An engraving of it is in the Antiquarian Reposi tory. On the 6th of August, 1 828, an action was tried at the Derby assizes, arising out of proceedings in the ecclesiastical court, in which the Chapelry of Taddington resisted the mode of assessment for re-building the spire of Bakewell church. The churchwardens had appealed against the rate being determined by the scores of cattle. On the other side it was contended that this mode of assessment had been the custom time out of mind. During this trial, it was proved that the parish of Bakewell had preserved some very ancient records, more ancient indeed than most parishes, and that the custom upon which the churchwardens had acted, had existed for at least a period of 190 years. Mr. Thomas Hancock, churchwarden of Bakewell, produced the parish books, and from these it appeared, that, on the 15th of September, 1638, the following were the score-rates : The parish church of Bakewell was rated at 18 score, at Sd. each beast, and the sum received .900 Longstone .... 13 6 10 0 Baslow 14 7 0 0 Monyash 10 5 0 0 Chelmorton .... 13 ti 10 0 Part of Buxton ... lo* 800 Taddington . . . . l(i 8 0 0 Ashford 11 5 10 0 Beeley 4 200 Sheldon 6 . , .300 Rowsley 4 200 Rowland Ij, 0 15 0 Hsssop 4 ! 2 0 0 Over Haddon ...4 200 Sir Godfrey had two wives.

Agreeably to a recent regulation, we believe that the rate upon each township is now double the above amount. In the church-yard some epitaphs are to be found worth recording. We select the following in memory of Roe, the parish clerk. His father had filled the same situation ; and, if we believe the lines on his grave-stone, with equal ability. It tells us in prose, that \" the natural powers of his voice in clearness, strength and sweetness, were altogether unequalled.\" The writer of the lines on the adjoining tomb-stone, has eulogised the extraordinary vocal powers of the son thus : \" The vocal powers here let us mark, \" Of Philip our late parish clerk, \" In church none ever heard a layman \" With a clearer voice say ' Amen !' \" Who now with hallelujah's sound, \" Like him can make the roofs rebound ? \" The choir lament his choral tones, \" The town so soon here lie his bones.\" Epitaph supposed to be written by Mr. C. Wesley, a brother of the great founder of the Methodists. \" Beneath this stone an infant lies, \" To earth whose body lent, \" Hereafter shall more glorious rise, \"But not more innocent. \" When the archangel's trump shall blow, \" And souls to bodies join, \" Thousands shall wish their lives below \" Had been as short as thine.\" The following inscription lo the memory of a child aged two years and eight months. \" Reader ! beneath this marble lies \"The sacred dust of Innocence ; \" Two years he blest his parent's eyes, \"The third an angel took him hence : \" The sparkling eyes, the lisping tongue, \" Complaisance sweet and manners mild, \" And all that pleases in the young, \" Were all united in this child. \" Wouldst thou his happier state explore ? \" To thee the bliss is freely given ; \" Go, gentle reader ! sin no more, \" And thou shalt see this flower in heaven.\" Within the church there are the following monumental inscriptions, arms, &c.

The font within the church is of great antiquity : its form is octagon, and on each face is the representation of one of the apostles r^fcely sculptured. In the church-yard there is an ancient stone cross, supposed to have been brought from some other place. The height of it is eight feet, exclusive of the pedestal. The width is two feet. The ornaments and sculptured devices on the four sides are much worn and defaced, but they are evidently subjects taken from the scriptures. On one side of the cross are the birth, crucifixion, the entombment, the resurrection and ascension : on the reverse is Christ entering Jerusalem upon an ass.

LADY MANNERS' SCHOOL.\u2014 By indre. bearing date 12th May, 1636, between Grace Lady Manners, widow, of the one part, and John Greaves, esq. and others, of the other part ; the said Lady Manners, in order to make a provision for the maintaining a schoolmaster for ever, to teach a free-school within the township of Bakewell, for the better instructing of the male children of Bakewell and Great Rowsley, in good learning, and the christian religion, granted to the said John Greaves and others and their heirs, a yearly rent charge of \u00a315. to be issuing out of lands at Elton. She directed that her heirs, being of full age, and lords of the manor of Had don, should have the appointment of the schoolmaster. The present master of this school, the Rev. John Browne, was appointed in 1806, by the Duke of Rutland, as the heir of Lady Manners, on the recommendation of the then vicar, and several of the inhabitants of Bakewell. Mr. Browne receives \u00a350. per annum ; viz. the said rent charge of \u00a315. per annum, with a voluntary addition of \u00a335. from the Duke. In respect of this salary, the schoolmaster instructs, gratuitously, such boys of the township of Bakewell and Great Rowsley, whose parents think proper to send them to the school, in reading English, and writing, and in Latin and Greek, if required. Arithmetic is also taught to those boys whose parents wish them to learn it, on payment of 1 Os. 6d. per quarter. MARY HAGUE'S SCHOOL. \u2014 By will, bearing date 20th Nov. 1715, she gave her house, garden, stable, and nine square yards of land for ever, for teaching so many poor children, be longing to the poor of Bakewell, in reading, as the yearly rent would amount to, until they could read the bible, and then to be removed and others supply their places. Ralph Bradbury, the parish clerk, was appointed schoolmaster by the vicar and parish officers. He receives the emoluments, and for them instructs seven poor children, boys and girls, of the township of Bakewell, appointed by the churchwardens. SIR JOHN MANNERS' HOSPITAL, called SAINT JOHN'S HOSPITAL.\u2014 By deed, bearing date the last day of April, 1602, and 25th April, 1605, reciting that Roger Manners, esq. brother of John Manners, of Nether Haddon, esq. of his charitable disposition left \u00a3600. to the said John Manners, esq. to purchase a rent charge of \u00a340. per annum, for the benefit of the poor people inhabiting within the township of Bakewell, in the said hospital ; and that in consideration thereof, the said John Manners, by indre. made the last day of Oct. 36 Elizabeth, had granted to the said Roger Manners and others, a rent charge of \u00a322. issuing out of land, &c. of the said John Manners, at Bradmore, in the county of Nottingham, to be employed by the lord of Nether Haddon for the time being, for the relief of four poor men residing at Bakewell, and another rent charge of \u00a318. per annum, issuing out of an estate now in the possession of Mr. Anthony Alsop, of Wensley, consisting of about 18 acres, at Wensley, in the parish of Darley, for the maintenance of two alms' people. The said Sir John Manners, knt. incorporated the said six persons by the name of the Governor and Poor of St. John's Hospital, in Bakewell, and ordained that they should have perpetual suc cession, and be capable of taking lands, and have a common seal, which should be kept locked in a chest, in the said Hospital, with four keys : whereof the governor should have one ; the heirs of the said John Manners one; the bailiff of Bakewell a third; and the vicar or curate of the church a fourth : and the said John Manners granted to the said governor and poor, and their successors for ever, the lower part of the newly erected town-hall, and directed that his heirs and assigns should keep the said lower part of the said newly erected house in repair for ever, and uphold the same. In the deed of 1602 a power was reserved by the grantor ofthe rent charge of \u00a322. to charge other lands with a rent charge of equal amount. The sum of \u00a322. is paid by the Duke of Rutland, who is the owner of Nether Haddon, and \u00a318. by Mr. Anthony Alsop, as the possessor ofthe estate at Wensley.

There is a cotton manufactory at Bakewell, situate near the entrance ofthe town from Ashford, at which are employed between three and four hundred hands, besides mechanics. It belonged formerly to Robert and Peter Arkwright, esqrs. who have recently sold it to Mr. Mason. Among the records that have been kept at Derby, of the important and interesting events which have taken place there, is a memorandum, that in the year 1608, the witches of Bakewell were hanged. The High Peak savings' bank is open every Monday to receive deposits. The Bakewell Dispensary was established by some of the principal inhabitants, under the patronage of the Dukes of Devonshire and Rutland, and the Earl of Newburgh, and other noble men and gentlemen. It will undoubtedly prove of infinite benefit to the lower orders of society. Great praise is due to Michael Atkinson, esq. Dr. Read, and Mr. Harris, surgeon, for their exer tions in the good cause. The meeting for the establishment of this institution was held on the 18th of September, 1828, the Rev. F. Hodgson chairman, and on the 18th of October following the Rules and Regulations were adopted ; Sir W. C Bagshaw and Sir F. S. Darwin accepted the appointment of honorary consulting physicians.

John Cokaine died 2 Henry VII. and left it his grandson Thomas, who left it to Francis. In 38 Elizabeth, it came to Sir Edward, who sold the manor. It passed by sale into the families of Ashley, Trott, Milward and Hurt, and was eventually divided into severalties. In 1719, Thomas Taylor, gent. Charles Adderley, esq. Matthew Vernon, esq. and Henry Boothby Vernon, esq. his son, were jointly seised of 1700 acres of land in Ballidon and Doveridge, and half the manor of Ballidon, a rent of 5s. and 1*. 6d. in Ballidon, 14s. id. in Lea hall, 40*. in Tissington, 34*. id. in Atlow, 100*. in Brassington, 73*. id. in Bradbome, the whole of the white or wool and lamb tithe in Bradborne, common of pasture, on the site of Ballidon, paying the vicar of Bradborne 13*. id. and tithe hay in Doveridge, viz. : the said Thomas Taylor one-half, Charles Adderley three-fifths, and the two Vemons the remaining two-fifths. In con sequence of a writ of partition, at the suit of Thomas Taylor being issued, the above lands, rents and tithes, were divided in the above proportions ; the part allotted by the above writ to Thomas Taylor, was devised by his descendant, Dr. John Taylor, to W. Webster, esq. the present owner. Adderley's share was purchased by the late Henry Richardson, esq. of Derby, who devised it to Miss Clay, the present owner; and the share, allotted as above to the Vernons, who had it by marriage and gift from the Boothbys, who also inherited from the Mil wards, was bequeathed by Matthew Vernon, of London, silk mercer, from motives of political attachment, to William Mur ray, earl of Mansfield, who, dying without issue in 1793, it devolved on his nephew, David, 7th viscount Stormont and earl of Mansfield, and on his death, 1st September, 1796, it came to his son William, the present and 3rd earl of Mansfield. The trustees of the Rev. Philip Storey are the present lords of the manor. The chapel is a mean building; the living is a curacy, stated in the king's books to be of the value of \u00a310. per annum.

In 1542, Sir William Holies, who had been lord-mayor of London, died seised of a manor here. In 1554, queen Mary granted the manor which had belonged to the earl of Derby to Dame Anne Stan hope; and it was sold by Sir Thomas Stanhope, in 1571, to Sir Richard Pype, some time lord mayor of London, who died seised of it, with the advowson of the rectory, in 1587. Francis Rodes, esq. who was made one of the justices of the common pleas in 1585, purchased of the family of Selioke an estate, described as the manor of Barlborough, which had belonged to the Constables. Sir John Rodes, son of the judge, had a chancery suit with Humphrey Pype, esq. son of the lord-mavor, abovenamed, who claimed to be sole lord of the manor of Barlborough, and asserted that the estate purchased of the Seliokes was freehold, but not manorial. It is proba ble that Sir John Rodes or some of his descendants, purchased Pype's moiety. The other moiety passed to a younger branch of the Poles of Wakebridge, by marriage. Park hall and manor continued to be the seat and property of this branch of the Pole famdy, until the death of two maiden ladies, Mrs. Margaret and Mrs. Mary Pole, in 1755, when it came to the Radbourn family. It is now the property of E. S. C. Pole, esq. of Radbourn. At the Conquest, there were a church, a priest, and one servant. The present handsome tower church is dedicated to St. James.

They are lineally descended from Gerard de Bodes, a baron, who lived in the reigns of king Henry the Second, Richard the First, John, and Henry the Third, and received great favours from each of them ; and was sent by king John, as an ambassador, into foreign parts. Sir John Rodes, of Barlborough, was the eldest son of Judge Rodes, by Catherine, third daughter of Marmaduke Constable, of Holderness, in the county of York. Sir Francis, his son, who was the fifteenth generation from the above Gerard de Rodes, was knighted on the 9th of August, 16-11, and five days afterwards was created a baronet. He married Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress of Sir George Lassels, of Sturton and Gateford, in the county of Nottingham, (he died the Sth of Feb. in the 28th year of his age, A. D. 1645) and was succeeded by his son, Sir Francis, the second baronet, who married the daughter of Sir Gervase Clifton, of Clifton, in the county of Nottingham, and died in the year 1651. Sir Francis, his son, married Martha, the daughter of William Thornton, of Grantham, in the county of Lincoln, gent. He was suc- ceeded by Sir John Rodes, his son, who died without issue in the year 1713, and was the last person who enjoyed the title. The sister of Sir John Rodes, married Gilbert Heathcote, esq. whose eldest son became possessed of the manor of Barlborough, and took the name of Rodes ; but dying unmarried, his nephew, Cornelius Heathcote, esq. upon his decease succeeded to the estate, and also took the name of Rodes. He died the 6th of March, 1825, aged 70, and was suc- ceeded by his nephew, the Rev. Cornelius Heathcote Reaston, who has also assumed the name of Rodes, and is the proprietor of 1651 a. 2 r. 31 p. of land in this township, and is joint lord ofthe manor with Mr. Pole. Rev. C. H. R. Rodes is also proprietor and lord of the manor of Elmton and part of Creswell, containing together about 2000 acres, besides the Cutthorpe estate.

BARLOW MAGNA, or GREAT BARLOW, is a parochial chapelry, township and con- Barleie, stabulary attached to the parish of Staveley, in the hundred of Scarsdale. The distance from Staveley is about six miles and a half, and from Ches terfield between three and four. \u2022 Sir John Rodes, by his will, 1731, entails his estate on his cousin, John Rodes, of Northgate in Harbury, and leaves him an annuity of \u00a320. a year."], [118, "94 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The townships of Great and Little Barlow contained in 1S21, 134 houses, 136 families, and 708 inhabitants. Of the 136 families, 49 were employed in agriculture, 68 in trade and handi craft, and 19 variously. The parish of Great Barlow contains 3372 a. Or. 37 p. of land, of which five-sixths are arable, meadow and pasture, in nearly equal divisions, but the arable rather exceeds the proportion of the other two; and the other sixth is wood and moor land, which is kept out of cultivation for the propa gation and preservation of moor-game. The tithes are redeemed by the enclosure bill of 1 8 1 7- The farms are in general small, and the rent is about 25*. per acre. The lower part of the parish is a good loamy soil, but the upper part is cold and heavy. There are in Great Barlow 128 houses and 563 inhabitants. There are 26 freeholders, 12 resident and 14 non-resident. Seven of the freeholders are from 40*. to \u00a310. and the remainder as high as from \u00a310. to \u00a3200. per annum. The annual value ofthe buildings and land is \u00a31973. 4*. \u2014 The families are principally supported by agriculture. The average annual amount of the parochial expenses, for the last seven years, has been \u00a3l6S. 2s. 10\\d. There is no house of industry, and the poor are relieved at their own dwellings. \u2014 There is one friendly society, consisting of 109 members: one endowed parochial school and one Sunday-school : at the latter, between 40 and 50 scholars are educated, and it is supported by voluntary subscription. The Duke of Rutland is the most considerable landed proprietor, and lord of the manor. His Grace holds no court, as the manorial rights were redeemed at the time of the enclosure bill, but he has still a claim of dues on minerals in the common land. A part of an old wall, supposed to be the ruins of Barlow hall, is still in existence. In Barlie, Hacon had two parts of one carucate of land to be taxed; land to half a plough. Six villanes and one bordar have there now one plough. There are two acres of meadow. Wood and pasture, one mile and a half long and eight quarentens broad. Falue in king Edward's time and now 10s.

The family of Abitot or Apetoft held the manor of Barlow in the reign of Edward I. : but in 18 Edward II. we find that Robert de Barlow held Barlow under Ralph de Frescheville, on the tenure of military service and attendance in the manor court. In 25 Henry VIII. the Barlows continued in possession under the same tenure.\u2014 About the year 1530-1, Robert Barlow married Elizabeth, the heiress of Hardwick, but he died within a few years after the marriage, and she became, successively, the wife of three other husbands, the last of whom was the Earl of Shrews bury. In 1 593, the manor was purchased of James Barlow, by George, Earl of Shrewsbury. The manor passed by purchase, marriage or descent, through the families of Newcastle, Oxford and Portland, and is now in the possession of the Duke of Rutland, in exchange for the manor of Whitwell. In the church, there are monuments and other memorials of the Barlow family, but they are much defaced. One represents a knight in armour, and is said to be the tomb of Robert Barlow who died in 1467- ' The living is a perpetual curacy ; the presentation of which is in the gift of the rector of Staveley, and the Rev. Thomas Field is the present incumbent. The value of the living has been augmented m the following manner: \u00a3410. and \u00a310. per annum rentcharge, given by Edward Earl of Oxford ; \u00a3700.

BARLOW LITTLE is a hamlet in the parish of Dronfield, and adjoins Great Barlow : the Barlow Parva, number of inhabitants is at present 56, who are mostly occupied in agri- culture. The quantity of land is 512 a. 1 r. 33 p. of indifferent quality, and the average rental is about 20*. per acre. The land is divided into arable, meadow and pas ture, in nearly equal proportions. The farms are small, and the tithes are collected by a fixed rate of composition. The buildings and land are valued at \u00a3294. 7*. per annum. The average poors' rate and other parochial expenses, for the last seven years, has been \u00a338. 19*. 9d. per an num. The Duke of Rutland is lord of the manor, and the inhabitants are chiefly tenants to his Grace. The nearest place of worship is the chapel at Great Barlow, but the parsonage-house is in Little Barlow. The inhabitants pay church-rates to Dronfield, but are assessed for highways, &c. with great Barlow. Adjoining Little Barlow is a very large bog, called Leech-field or Leash-field, from which two considerable brooks take their rise, supposed to occupy five or six hundred acres, being between three and four miles in circumference. There is a tradition that a town formerly stood here ; from which has arisen the following proverbial rhymes : When Leech-field was a market town, Chesterfield was gorse and broom ; Now Chesterfield's a market town, Leech-field a marsh is grown.

This village, called Barrow-upon-Trent, is a township, constabulary, and parish, Barewe. situate in the deanery of Derby. It extends into the hundreds of Appletree and Morleston and Litchurch ; and its distance from Derby is about 6 m. S. W. The name was probably derived from a very large barrow within the parish. The village stands between the Trent and the canal called the Trent and Mersey navigation ; while the parish comprises the hamlets or townships of Arleston and Sinfen, with the chapelry of Twyford and Stenson. The township of Barrow is bounded by Swarkstone, E. Twyford, W. Arleston and Sinfen, N. and the Trent, which divides it from Stanton, Ingleby and Foremark, S. In 1821, the township contained 54 houses, 57 families, and 307 inhabitants. Of the 57 families 43 were chiefly em ployed in agriculture, 12 in trade or handicraft, and 2 independent. The land is excellent : the subsoil being red marl, sand and gravel, watered by the Trent. Its extent is about 1150 acres, tithe free, at an average rental of 37*. 6d. or 40*. per acre. The Rev. Henry de V\u0153ux, lord of the manor, owns 400 acres ; John Beaumont, esq. 220 acres ; Richard Sale, gent. 180 acres; John Bancroft, gent. 160 acres; Sir George Crewe, bart. 86 acres ; S. E. Bristowe, esq. 70 acres ; Rev. William Heacock 36 acres, and Mr. Porter 16 acres. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a31457- 4*. 2d. The amount of the poors' rate, county rates and constables' accounts, taking an average of seven years, is \u00a3156. 4*. Id. The church rate and highway rate are collected as a separate assessment.

Barrow, according to Willis, belonged formerly to the knights Templar ; and six ox-gangs of land within and without this village, with their appurtenances were the property of the priory at Repton. Barrow was bestowed upon Henry de Ferrers by William the Conqueror. Before 1273 the bishops of Carlisle had an estate here as parcel of the rectory of Melbourn, and this manor was held on lease by the Cokes of Melbourn under the see of Carlisle, until in 1704, it was en franchised by an Act of Parliament, when it became the freehold of the Cokes. Subsequently it passed by marriage into the possession of Lord Melbourne, by whom it was sold about twenty nine years ago to Daniel Dalrymple, esq. whose heiress brought it and other property to the Rev. Henry de V\u0153ux, the present proprietor. In 1519, William Bothe, esq. died seised of lands at Barrow on Trent, which he held under the Priory of St. John, which lands were bestowed on the Prior and convent of St. John of Jerusalem, by Robert de Bakepuze, in the reign of Henry II. ; and the priory had a precentor at this place. The church has a handsome tower, with battlements and pinnacles. It is dedicated to St. Wilfred. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's book at \u00a320. and yearly tenths 10*. 7|rf. It has been augmented with \u00a3200. from the royal bounty, and there are 36 acres of glebe land. The present income is about \u00a3120. per annum. John Beaumont, esq. is the patron, and the Rev. William Heacock is the present vicar. Upon an alabaster stone at the entrance within the chancel is the effigy of a man in armour, and in the inscription appears the name of John Bothe, 1482. There is also the monument of another John Bothe, 1413. In the south wall of the south aisle of Barrow church, under an arch, is the effigy of an ecclesiastic, in rich drapery, now set upright. Several monuments have been destroyed by alterations. Monumental Inscriptions.

The first mention of their connexion with this country appears in the marriage of Richard, Viscount de Beaumont to Constance, a natural daughter of Henry I. In the twelfth century, Eremengard, the granddaughter of Richard de Beaumont, espoused William, king of Scotland, and became the mother of a line of kings; and in the next generation, we find the possessions and honours of the Beaumonts vested in a female (Agnes, Viscountess de Beau- mont and Mayne) who married Lewis de Brienne, surnamed of Aeon. The family of Brienne was extensively and powerfully allied. Their names are celebrated in the Crusades. Gauthier de Brienne became king of Naples and Sicily by his marriage with the daughter of Tancred : his brother John succeeded him, and, by espousing Yolanda, the daughter of the famous Conrade de MontifFarat, became one of the early nominal sovereigns of Jerusalem. Lewis of Aeon, who mar- ried the heiress of the Viscounts de Beaumont, was the second son of the king of Naples, and his children took the name of Beaumont. The eldest of these was related to Eleanor, the wife of Edward I. and served in the wars of that prince in Scotland, where he acquired the earldom of Buchan. In the reign of Edward II. his Scotch earldom was taken away from him, by the brave and successful Robert Bruce, and Beaumont, restless for the recovery of it, persuaded Edward III. to assert the claims of the English crown over the crown of Scotland. John, another of the sons of Lewis de Aeon, became the ancestor of the French branch of the Beaumonts. In the next generation, the Beaumonts became doubly connected with the reigning royal family, by the marriages of John, Lord Beaumont, and his sister Isabella . the latter with Henry of Lancaster, and the former with the sister of that prince. About the termination of the fourteenth century, the family branched into two lines, of which the elder, in the course of two generations, terminated in a female, who married John, Lord Lovell. John, Lord Beaumont, the father of the wife of Lord Lovell, was created Viscount Beaumont in 1 434 : he was constable and chamberlain of England, and fell at the battle of Northampton, July 10, 1460. The other line"], [124, "HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 100 proceeded from Sir Thomas Beaumont, Lord of Basqueville, in France, warden of the cinque ports, and governor of Dover castle. His eldest son, Sir John, of Coleorton, was ancestor of the Beaumonts of Coleorton, now existing: he was slain at the battle of Towton, fighting under the banners of the Red Rose faction. From Thomas, the second son of Sir Thomas of Basqueville, descended the Gracedieu and the Barrow branches ; which branches were united by the marriage of Robert Beaumont of Barrow, with Cicely, the heiress of the other line. The Gracedieu Beau monts have produced men of great literary talents. Sir Francis Beaumont, of Gracedieu, was one of the Judges of the Common Pleas, in the reign of Elizabeth.* Two of his sons (John and Francis) distinguished themselves as poets, and though the works of the former are now little read, they were popular for many years : the Dramatic works written by the latter in conjunction with his friend Fletcher, son of the Bishop of London, will ever be ranked among the highest classics of our language. Joseph Beaumont, Master of Jesus College and Peterhouse in the se venteenth century, was of the same family, and published several poems of a religious nature. Sir John Beaumont, son of Sir John Beaumont, the poet, edited his father's works. He was re markable for his extraordinary strength and agility. In the troubles during the reign of Charles I. he joined the royalists, and was slain at the siege of Gloucester. His commission, under the king's sign manual, is in the possession of Mr. Beaumont, of Barrow. John Beaumont, of Barrow upon-Trent, esq. married, about six years ago, one of the daughters of Lord Scarsdale. Mr. Beaumont was nominated, by the Lord Lieutenant of this county, his Grace the Duke of Devon shire, Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Derby, soon after the pas sing of the Catholic Relief Bill. Mr. Beaumont, and his amiable lady, are kind benefactors to the poor of the neighbourhood. Among the suffering loyalists are noticed Sir John, a Colonel in the king's army (who died in the service) who, with Lord Beaumont, Sir Thomas Beaumont, Thomas Beaumont, of York, and George Beaumont, paid \u00a35000. and Sir Thomas Beaumont, sixth son ofthe first bart. paid \u00a31190 composition. The Sales and the Bancrofts have long been seated at Barrow, and are families of good estate and highly respectable. BARTON BLOUNT is a village, township, constabulary, and parish, in the hundred of Apple- Barctune, tree. Its distance from Derby is about 11m. westward. This township consists of 6 houses, 6 families, and 60 inhabitants : about forty of whom are engaged in agriculture. The quantity of land is about 1200 acres, and the estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a32218. 15*. Two-thirds of the land consist of meadow and pasture, the remainder is arable. The tithes ofthe whole parish is paid at a modus of \u00a3ll. The farms are from 100 to 330 acres each, and the rent is about 40*. per acre. The soil is strong, upon a marl substratum, with a small proportion on gravel. A fine stream of water runs through the township. The poors' rate amounts to about 18d. per acre. The male infant paupers are gene- rally apprenticed to trades. F. Bradshaw, esq. is the lord of the manor, who, with E. S. C. Pole, esq. of Radbourn, the owner of Barton Fields farm, of about 206 acres, are the only freeholders. In Barclune, Godric, another Godric, Edric, Levenot, Elfeg, Ledmor, Dunninc and Edward, had four carucates of land to be taxed. Land to four ploughs. There are three ploughs now in the de- mesne, and nineteen villanes and eleven bordars having seven ploughs. There is a priest, and a church, and two mills of 20s. and sixty-four acres of meadow, value in king Edward's time and now four pounds. D. B. 304. At the conquest, the manor of Barton or Barctune was given to Henry de Ferrers. In 1296 John de Bakepuze held it under Edward, Earl of Lancaster. Many of the Bakepuze or Bake- * There are extant letters from Francis Beaumont to the Earl of Shrewsbury. One, dated Normanton, near Derby, July 3, 1589, contains an apology for omitting to pay \u00a3100. on a certain day, and requests the Earl's permission to name him his chief patron in his introductory speech, in the Court of Common Pleas as a sergeant at law such be ing then the custom on those occasions. In a letter from Gracedieu he requests some venison for the sergeant's feast Dec. loth, and desires his Lordship's acceptance of a sergeant's ring : he also describes the tenure of land, called the Castle Orchard, in Melbourn. In Dec. 1590, he writes a letter of condolence and congratulation to the new Earl."], [125, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 101 puize family resided here, and lie buried in the church ; and their arms were emblazoned on some of the church windows. This family were adherents of the house of Ferrers, Earls of Derby, to whose deeds they appear to be often witnesses. All or great part of the lands of Fer rers, in Derbyshire, were made over to Ralf de Bakepuize (who died 25 Edward I.) in trust some way or other, to preserve them during the misfortunes of that family. This appears from the circumstance that Ralf de Bakepuize held Alkmanton, Trusley, Radbourn and other lands which had previously belonged to the Ferrers. From the family of the Bakepuizes, the place acquired the denomination of Barton Bakepuize. In the reign of Henry IV. Barton came into the possession, by purchase, of Sir Walter Blount, who had a charter for free warren at Barton, in 1385, and who was afterwards slain at the battle of Shrewsbury, being then the king's standard-bearer. Sir Walter resided at Barton Park. His feoffe in trust, Thomas Langley, Bishop of Duresme and Lord Privy Seal to Henry IV. made of part of these lands, a settlement or dowry to Sancia de Ayale of Toledo, a Spanish lad}', who came into England with Constancia, daughter of Peter, king of Castile, and wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. This lady was then the widow of Sir Walter, as appears by the deed, dated at Barton 1 Henry V. and witnessed by Sir Nicholas Montgomery, Sir Nicholas Longford, and Sir John Dabridgecourt, knts. ; Thomas Foljambe and John Fitzherbert, esqrs. Walter Blount, Lord High Treasurer to Edward IV. was created Lord Mountjoy in 1465. His grandson, who died in 153.5, directed by his will, that he should be buried at Barton. From the Blounts, the manor was called Barton Blount. About the middle of the sixteenth century it came into the family of Merry. Sir Henry Merry held it in l6l 1. The heiress of the Merrys married a Simp son about the year 1700. In 1751 it was purchased by Sir Nathaniel Curzon, of the trustees of Merry Simpson, who retired to a French monastery. Sir Nathaniel Curzon sold to Lister, Lister to Samuel Crompton, esq. who conveyed the manor and advowson of the church, to Francis Bradshaw, esq. the present proprietor. The church is an ancient and plain structure covered with ivy. Under an arch in the chancel there are some broken effigies, said to have been placed there agreeably to the will of Lord Mountjoy, and the figure of a female in a gown, represented in the attitude of prayer, holding her heart in her hands. The living is a rectory, in the archdeaconry of Derby, of the clear value of \u00a320. with yearly tenths 9*. 1 Id.

Though the connexion is not directly shown, yet this family is certainly descended from that of Bradshaw in the Peak, which latter family is said to be descended from the same ancestor as the Bradshaws of Haigh, near Wigan, in Lancashire, who were lineally descended from Sir John Bradshaw, knt. of the race of the Saxons, at the Norman conquest, when he was repossessed of his estate by king William I. Barton hall stands near the ancient church, in a fine open country, surrounded by excellent land. The old hall or manor house was a castellated building, surrounded by a moat. During the civil wars it was garrisoned by the parliament's troops, under the command of Colonel Gell, in October, 1644, for the purpose of watching the movements ofthe king's troops at the garrison of Tutbury. On the 15th of February, 1646, a skirmish occurred between the two garrisons \u25a0 and it appears, by an entry in the parish register of Longford, that on the 24th of August, 1645^ a previous skirmish had taken place, in which two men were killed by pistol shots, at Alkman ton, and that two bullets, having entered the back of one of these men, came out at his belly. The ancient hall has undergone great alterations, the present owner and occupier having enlarged and modernized the building, so that its appearance is completely changed; excepting that two towers in the east front remain to indicate its former character. BARWARDCOTE, is a small village and lordship in the parish of Etwall, and hundred of B B^owcote?' APPletree> consisting of two or three farm houses. The capital mansion, mentioned in Wolley's manuscript more than a century ago, was the resi dence of the Boningtons.

This manor and Burnaston was part of the estates of Henry de Ferrers at the Doomsday Sur vey. In 1290 these manors were held by Roger de Chambreis. In 1297 they were held under the Earl of Lancaster. In 1 370 John de Bakepuze held them for one knights' fee ; and in the reign of Henry IV. they were held by the Boningtons. In the manuscript of Wolley it is said, that the last of that family sold the manor of Barwardcote to Samuel Pole, of Radbourn, esq. but Lysons states that it was sold, in 1672, to William Turner, of Derby. Exuperius Turner sold it to Robert Newton, esq. who, in 1789, bequeathed it to John Leaper, esq. That gentleman took the name of Newton, and his son, Robert Leaper Newton, esq. is the present proprietor. BASLOW is a considerable village, township, constabulary and parochial chapelry, distant about Basselawe, 5 m. E. of Bakewell, and 7 m. W. from Chesterfield, situate in a valley on the east bank of the river Derwent, in the hundred of High Peak. Almost the whole population, which in 1831, was 863, consisting of 187 families, occupying 165 houses: of the families, 18 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 78 in trade or handicraft, and 91 who are not included in the two preceding classes : the only manufacture being a few looms for weaving calicos and ging hams. Ofthe 255 males above 21 years old, 128 are employed in retail trade or handicraft, and 66 are labourers. \u2014 There are 4 calico-weavers, 1 framework-knitter, 6 gardeners, 3 millwrights, 3 tanners, 5 tailors, 4 shopkeepers, 1 3 shoemakers, 3 saddlers, 4 publicans, 1 patten maker, 7 millers, 1 maltster, 2 gun makers, 2 grocers, 2 glaziers, 1 currier, 1 cooper, 3 bakers, 4 black smiths, 2 plasterers, 27 masons, 2 house painters, 2 butchers, 5 carpenters, 14 cabinetmakers, 3 wheelwrights, 4 sawyers, and 2 carvers and gilders. The townships of Curbar, Froggatt, and Rowland, and the village of Bubnell, are within the chapelry of Baslow : the two former, and the latter, make part of the manor, which is the pro perty of the Duke of Rutland, whose estate here consists of 2602 acres in Baslow, 2403 acres in Bubnell, 1202 acres in Curbar, and 248 acres in Froggatt. The land is principally gritstone, and the extensive moors present but a barren appearance. The farms are under 1 50 acres each, and the rent of the land cultivated varies from 10*. to 60*. per acre. The annual estimated value of all the land and buildings in the township of Baslow is \u00a31961. 10*. lOd. The Duke of Rutland is lessee under the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield for the tithes, which are charged in the rent. The average parochial expenses, during the last seven years, is \u00a3449- per annum. This amount includes the poors' rate, county rate, and constables' accounts, mole-catcher, \u00a3ll. &c The wages of labourers are from seven to twelve shillings per week, and there are six or seven em ployed in house-row-work. There being no workhouse, the inhabitants send their paupers to Ashover house of industry, to which they contribute. Besides the endowed free school, there are two Sunday schools, one at the church, and the other at the meeting-house, supported by voluntary contributions. There is a sort of Friendly Society, under the name of Odd Fellows. The river Derwent waters part of the town, over which there is one of the best constructed bridges of stone in the county. The Nelson-rocks are three stones of a similar character to those named in the township of Cor- bar, but of less dimensions, on the other side of the road, upon one of the lofty hills that over looks Barlow, Chatsworth, &c. Near them is a stone pillar, carved with Nelson's name, the date of the battle of Trafalgar, and the names of the vessels engaged. It also bears the names of the persons who were at the expense of the erection. On these moors, the Duke of Rutland has been accompanied in the sport of moor-game shoot ing, by their Graces of Devonshire and Wellington, the late Duke of York, and numerous other noble persons. In 6 Edward I. Gilbert de Fraunceys was possessed of the manor of Basselawe ; and in the 25th of the same reign, Richard de Vernon was possessed of the same manor. It appears by the Calend. Inquis. Post Mori, that in 16 Edward II. there were four water-mills at Baslow, held by"], [128, "104 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Richard Vernon and his wife Matilda, who also held half of the manor of Basselawe. John, Earl of Shrewsbury was seised of this manor in the reign of Henry VI. Some records describe a moiety of the manor of Baslow as held under the Abbot of Darley, in the reign of Henry VI. together with the manor of Bubnell, by John, Earl of Shrewsbury. Bubnell or Bobenhall was, at the time of the Norman Survey, a berewick to Aisseford. It was long in the possession ofthe Fraunceys. At present the Duke of Rutland is in possession of this manor, and holds a court once in every three years. The church at Baslow is a very ancient edifice, with a tower terminated by a low spire. The living is a perpetual curacy, under the peculiar jurisdiction of the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, valued in the king's books at \u00a327- 16*. 8d. It has been augmented by the royal bounty \u00a3800. and by a parliamentary grant of \u00a31000. and it is now worth from \u00a3150. to \u00a3lS0. per annum. The patronage was formerly possessed by the vicar of Bakewell, but by an Act of Parliament, passed in 1811, the presentation was vested in the Duke of Devonshire. The present incumbent is the Rev. A.

The manor of Beard belonged to the ancient family of Beard, who resided at Beard hall for many generations ; Richard Beard, the last of the elder branch, had a daughter who married suc cessively two brothers of the Leigh family, to whom she brought the manor. The Leighs appear to have been succeeded by the Duncalfes. In 9 Edward II. Thomas le Ragged held 63 acres of land and 10 acres of wood in Beard. In 39 Henry VI. John, Earl of Shrewsbury, held the ma nor of Beard. In the reign of Henry VIII. John, Earl of Shrewsbury, possessed the manor, and it has passed with Ollerset and Eyam to Lord George Augustus Cavendish. Beard hall is now occupied by one of Lord George's tenants. Ollerset hall, formerly the seat of the Bradbury fa mily, is now a farm house, belonging to George William Newton, esq.

The extent and proprietors of this hamlet, we are not enabled to give. Whitle, or Whittle, is part of the lordship of Longdendale, which belongs to the king, and leased to his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. This hamlet contains 666 a. 3 r. 4 p. of old, and 1249 a. 0 r. 36 p. of new enclosed land, watered by the river Sett, and divided among 25 pro prietors, the principal of whom is Wilbraham Egerton, esq. who owns of the old enclosed land 247 a. 3 r. 20 p. ; George William Newton, esq. 82 a. 3 r. 15 p. ; Joshua Gregory's devisees, 60 a. 1 r. ; Ralph Bower, 34 a. 1 r. 37 p. ; Bennett and Creswell, 24 a. 2 r. 27 p. ; Wadsworth and Longden, 29 a. 2 r. 13 p. ; Samuel Thornaly and Co. 30 a. 0 r.14 p. ; Richard Broom, 31 a.

The estimated annual value of all the land and buildings is \u00a336l6. The average of 3 J years parochial expenses is \u00a3600. yearly. \u2014 In consequence of the great increase of population, an ele gant new chapel at New Mills, which is chiefly in the hamlet of Whitle, ofthe church establish- p"], [130, "106 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER ment, has been recently built, and there are also two handsome chapels erected by the Baptist and Methodist congregations. This village is romantically seated on a steep rock, on the north bank of the river Sett. On the west side of the village, the river Goyte, which flows through some abrupt rocks, joins the Sett, and they afterwards fall into the Mersey. The cotton mills are chiefly on the north bank of the Sett. They are built in a narrow ravine below the village. The manufactory for en graving calico printers' rollers, established here by Messrs. Potts, Oliver and Potts, is not only extensive and interesting, but an honour to the county. The proprietors in the four hamlets amount to 107- BEAUCHIEF is an extra-parochial district, adjoining the parish of Norton, in the hundred of Scarsdale. It derives its name from the Abbey de Bello-Capite, which also gives to the beautiful surrounding valley, the denomination of Abbey Dale. Its extent is about 500 acres, besides moors and woodlands of about 90 or 100 acres. The annual value is stated to be \u00a3847. 3s. \u2014 The number of houses is 1 6, and 88 inhabitants, who are chiefly engaged in agriculture. The sub stratum of the soil is gritstone, and the land is generally of a good quality. The amount raised in 1828 for the poor and county-rate, was \u00a368. 19*. 9d. \u2014 The benefice of the chapel is a donative, with no settled income, and the Rev. William Pashley is incumbent. The lord of the manor, Peter Pegge Burnell, esq. is the patron. \u2014 The ancient abbey stood on the declivity of a romantic hill, about two miles from Norton. It was founded between the years 1172 and 1186, by Robert Fitz-Ralph or Ranulph, lord of Alfreton, Norton and Marnham, who according to Dugdale, Tan ner and other writers, was one of the four knights who assassinated Thomas-a-Becket, archbishop of Canterbury ; this abbey therefore was supposed to have been erected and endowed by him in expiation of his guilt. Dr. Pegge has adduced many ingenious arguments in refutation of this tradition, but he can scarcely be said to have succeeded in his conclusions. Robert de Fitz-Ra nulph placed in the abbey a Premonstratensian abbot and canons,* and bestowed on them the churches of Alfreton, Norton and Elvaston, in Derbyshire, Wymeswould in Leicestershire, and lands in Norton and elsewhere. Ralph de Eccleshal gave the monks of Beauchief a corn mill, on the river Sheaf, which stood at a place now called the mill or milne houses. tGerard de Furnivall gave the monks liberty to turn thirty of their cows into his forest of Fullwood, with their young, under three years old, and an acre of land whereon to erect winter-sheds ; and his son, Thomas de Furnivall, gave the monks his grange of Fullwood, with the lands and common-pasture of Fullwood and Riveling, for all the cattle of the monastery, except goats. Sir Thomas Chaworth gave Greenhill in Norton, for the support of an additional canon. The abbot of Beauchief was summoned to Parliament in the reign of Edward I. \u2014 At the time of the Reformation, the patronage ofthe abbey was in the daughters and co-heirs of John Ormond, the representative ofthe founder. The revenues ofthe abbey, at the time of its suppression in 1536, were valued at \u00a3126. 3s. id per annum ; and in the year following, the abbey and surrounding * Of this expiatory foundation, the religious order of the premonstratensians, or white canons, had the advantage. These were an order of regular canons, instituted in 1120, by St. Norbert, a relation of the emperor Henry V. ; who, retiring from a life of dissipation to the most exemplary piety and laborious exercise of preaching, had a desert val ley, named Premontre, bestowed upon him by the bishop of Laon, in which he built the first monastery of the order ; and hence their name, although from their founder they are also called Norbertines ; at first the religious of this or der were so poor, that they had only a single ass, which served to carry the wood they cut down every morning, and sent to Laon, in order to purchase bread. But, in a short time, they received so many donations, and built so many monasteries, that thirty years after the foundation of this order, they had above 100 abbeys in France and Germany ; and in process of time, had monasteries in all parts of Christendom, amounting to 1000 abbeys, 300 provostships, a vast number of priories, and 300 monasteries. They came first into England in 1146 ; and in the reign of Edward I. had 27 monasteries here. The rule they followed was that of St. Augustine, with some slight alterations, and the ad dition of certain severe laws, the authority of which did not long survive their austere founder. + This Gerard de Furnivall was governor of the counties of Derby and Nottingham, temp. Henry III. he married Matilda de Lovetot, who with her husband were benefactors to Beauchief, which, observes Dr. Pegge, was but a be coming and gracious return for the present of Robert Fitz Ranulph to Worksop abbey, after the erection of his own abbey at Beauchief."], [131, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 107 district was granted to Sir Nicholas Strelley for the sum of \u00a3223. ; and about the middle of the 17th century, it passed by marriage into the possession of Edward Pegge, esq. to whose descend ant, Peter Pegge Burnell, esq. it now belongs. Beauchief hall was built by Edward Pegge, esq. in the reign of Charles II. It stands on the summit of a well-wooded hill, and is in that irregular architectural style which characterized the century succeeding the demolition of the monasteries, and proves the employment of the material belonging to those sanctified edifices in the erection of private mansions. It is now in the occu pation of Broughton Steade, esq. \u2014 There are no remains of the abbey, except a part of the chapel, which was repaired by Mr. E. Pegge in the reign of Charles II. The exterior of the chapel is extremely plain, except that it has reeded windows, with double buttresses at the angles. A part of the ground-plan may be traced by an old adjoining wall, in which are the remains of two circular gothic arches. It had long been in ruins before Mr. Pegge repaired it ; and the in habitants buried their dead at Norton and Dronfield. There are the arms, &c. of the Strelleys and Pegges in the chapel. \" We have in this family an instance which by some has been supposed rare, of the direct de scendants of the original grantee possessing and residing upon the abbey-lands granted to their ancestor. What indeed could tempt the family to forsake a residence circumstanced so agreeably in every respect as Beauchief? not to be last enumerated among the advantages of this choice spot, is the preservation of so many records of the monastic establishment in its days of prosperity, and that there has arisen among the family of its modern owners an antiquary who has known how to make a judicious use ofthe materials for its history. The late Dr. Samuel Pegge, rector of Whittington, was descended of Humphrey Pegge, of Osmaston, who was cousin-german to Edward Pegge, who married the heiress of Beauchief. But through his mother he had a nearer connexion with the house whose history he has so well described. She was a daughter of Fran cis Steyenson, of Unstone, by Gertrude, his wife, the daughter of Edward Pegge, of Beauchief, esq. and Gertrude Strelley. *' Of what Mr. Edward Pegge did here, some time after he had married the heir of Strelley, we have a circumstantial and curious account from the hand of Brailssord, a Derbyshire antiquary, who lived at the beginning of the last century. Beauchief hall was built by Edward Pegge, to which there is first a spacious outer green yard, from which through a large pair of well wrought iron gates, and 011 each side .pallisadoed with iron, we enter into a garden on the south side of the house, and on a large walk through the middle of the garden are conducted to a noble pair of stone stairs, of nineteen greises or steps, at the head of which, entering through a pair of gates into a foot-path, from which goes down stairs of nine steps, both east and west, into a paved court-yard, and from the same foot-path continues our ascent up as many stone steps into a pas sage over a large stone arch (under which passeth a fair walk the whole front of the house) and under a balcony into the hall (the stairs all of stone, and several persons may walk together in a breast up them; they are set with rails and banister of good stone-work, and so is the head end of the garden along on each side the stairs) and on a fair stone over the door leading into the hall, is engraven, viz. : e Eben-ezer. H\u00e6c domus ergo Deus stet honoris grata columna : Nam domus et domini conditor ipse Deus. E. P. Maii 17,\"l67L ' Here is a fair prospect adorned with wood ; and on a paved court before the house, through a pair of gates out of another garden on the east of the house into a long walk set with fir-trees, on the side of a close, at the far end of which walk we are in view of the ruins of Beauchief ab bey, which is about a quarter of a mile from us, and of an extensive prospect into Yorkshire over the town of Sheffield. In a part of this close is the sweetest and clearest echo from the hall that I ever heard. ' Over a portal, within the hall doors, is cut on wood Pegge's arms, quartering Strelley, and a fess dancitte or deep indented."], [132, "108 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER ' There is also an entrance into the house both east and west, by stone stairs of twelve greises, with balconies over the doors. ' On the ground-floor of the house are seventeen rooms. On the next floor, with the hall, par lour and dining-room, are seven rooms ; and in the dining-room is a pretty wrought chimney piece, of alabaster ; and between two pillars, on each side, supporting a canopy, is the effigies of an ancient man with a long beard, with a furred gown of half sleeves, and upon a mantle thrown over his shoulders, a collar of S. S. and roses, a little book in his hand, a ruff up to his ears, and a cap upon his head, like unto a judge's cap. On the outside of the said supporters or pillars is the arms of Pegge, quartering Strelley's. Above this floor of rooms is another story. ' The kitchen-gardens and the stables are westward, at a convenient distance from the house. And there is a pretty large walled paddock for deer, well wooded, before the front of the house, adjoining to the out-yards. ' The chimney-piece above mentioned was given by Mr. Adrian Mundy, of Quarn, whose only daughter and heir (a great fortune) was to have been married to Gervase Pegge, elder brother to Christopher Pegge, now of Beauchief, but that he was snatched away by death when he was a student of Gray's Inn. ' A remaining part of the body of Beauchief abbey is repaired at the sole charge of Mr. Pegge, of Beauchief hall, and that is their burying place, and where sometimes is divine service and preaching.' \" In the museum of George Savile Foljambe, esq. of Osberton, co. Nottingham, is a carving in alabaster, representing the assassination of Thomas-a-Becket, which is supposed to have been the original altar-piece of Beauchief abbey, and the gift of some member of the ancient family of Foljambe, whose arms it bears. The stone is about two feet high, nineteen inches broad, and about six inches thick ; the figures, which stand under a canopy hollowed out of the stone, are about eighteen inches high.

Warner de Beelegh, and afterwards his son Serlo, held this manor about the reign of Richard I. \u2022 and after passing to the Chenys of Northamptonshire, it came into the possession of lord Vaux, of Harrowden, whose youngest son, Nicholas, held it in right of his mother, and in 1560 sold it to Dean and Greaves ; the latter family had been seated at the Greaves, in this chapelry, from the time of Henry III. About the middle of the seventeenth century, the family of Greaves sold it to the Saviles, who resided at Hilltop, formerly the Greaves. It is now the property of the Duke of Devonshire, whose ancestor purchased the same about the middle ofthe last century. As early as 1280 there was a chapel in this place, the minister of which had five marks yearly. \u2014 The following curious deed, which was in the collection ofthe late Adam Wolley, of Matlock, esq. bears the date of 1473. \" That there is a devoute chapell in Beley in Derwent Dale, which is a new begonne thing of our sweet lady St. Mary,* and hathe nothing but through the grace of God and the almes of goode men and wymmen, but that won Sir John Eyre, chapeleyn, moved with grace and virtue, hath laboured and done great cost there, as well of his owne proper costs as of his pore neighbours, and hath gotten thereto boke, bell, vestment and chales, and hath a preest there sayinge masse daily before our sayde ladye for all brethren and sisters, and all good doers thereto, and purposeth through the grace of God and our sayde ladye and succoure of good men and wymmen, to found a preest there for ever to pray for all the benefactors and goode doers thereto, which he may not utterly perform without refreshyng and almsdede of goode men and wymmen, wherefore if hit please you to shew your blessed almes thereto, hit is your owne, and * Pilkinglon says, the chapel is dedicated to St. Anne."], [135, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 111 our sayde blessed ladye will reward you : and also we have sent amongst you won Thomas Wil lymot, which is a very trewe proctour, and a special benefactor and good doer there.

This parish includes the villages of Berley, Hackenthorpe and Southwell, and contained in 1831, 179 houses, 207 families, and 980 inhabitants, being an increase since 1801, of 346 persons Of the 207 families, 71 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 78 in trade or handicraft, and 58 va riously. The principal trade is the manufacture of scythes and sickles, and working of collieries. There are 233 males above 21 years of age in the township. The township of Beighton contains 2407 acres of old, and 600 acres of newly enclosed land, which is divided among 50 proprietors, viz. : the earl Manvers, who owns 2280 acres, William Booth, esq. the vicar of Beighton, Rev.

All the land is titheable except Berley moor, where an allotment was given to the impropriator and vicar in lieu of tithes. The tithes are valued every fourteen years, and this valuation regu lates both the vicar's and lord Manvers' shares : the latter possesses most of the rectorial tithes. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a35505. 5s. The average amount of the poor rates, including the constables' accounts, for the last seven years, is \u00a3407. 6s. 3d. ; and the county rates, \u00a372. 4*. 5d. per annum. The paupers are generally relieved at their own dwel lings, except three or four, who are kept in the poor-house at Ashover. There is one en dowed free-schol, one Wesleyan Methodist chapel, and two public-houses in the township. Within half a mile of Beighton, on the east bank of the Rother, is some ancient earth- works, supposed to have been a Roman station. In Beciune were five ox-gangs and a half of land to be taxed.

This manor belonged lo Roger de Busli. D. B. 299> 317, 325. This manor was given, in the reign of king Ethelred, to Burton Abbey. At the Conquest, it appears to have been divided into two manors : one of which was held by Lewin, under Roger de Busli, and the other belonged to Roger de Poictou. Before 1276, Sir Gervase de Bernake \u2022was lord of Beighton, and was one of the benefactors to the abbey of Beauchief. In 1279, Wal ter de Furneux possessed the manor, and left it to his son William, who died seised of it in 1320 : his sisters and co-heiresses married Latimer and Ravensworth, and on failure of issue from Lati mer, the whole devolved to Henry Fitzhugh, son of Henry de Ravensworth. A co-heiress of Henry, the last baron Fitzhugh, brought Beighton to Sir John Fiennes, eldest son of Richard the first lord Dacre, of the south. In 1 570, Gregory lord Dacre sold the manor to Francis Wort ley, esq. Before 1649, the family of Pierrepont possessed the manor. The sister and heiress of William Pierrepont, the last duke of Kingston, brought this estate into the family of the present possessor, Earl Manvers, of Thoresby park and Holme Pierrepont, co. Nottingham. The ancient tower church is dedicated to St. Mary. In 1455, Sir James Strange ways, knt. and Elizabeth his wife, gave this church to the priory of Mountgrace, in Yorkshire. In 1 544 Hen ry VIII. granted the rectory and advowson to Robert and William Swift; one of the daughters of Robert Swift brought this estate to her husband, Francis Wortley, esq. and it has since passed with the manor. On an oak beam in the roof the date of 1100 is visible, which is only thirty four years after William the Conqueror desolated the country. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at \u00a320. and yearly tenths 13*. 2\\d. The present income of the vicar is de rived from a rent-charge of \u00a310. royal bounty \u00a3200. and about forty acres of glebe land : the remainder from a composition, tithe corn rent, which is paid in money twice a year, and varies with the price of wheat. Earl Manvers is the patron, and the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Erskine, M. A. is the present vicar. Arms and Inscriptions in the Church.

The ancient family of Pierrepont is said to have derived their name from the lordship of Hurst Pierrepont, in Sussex, which was in possession of Robert de Pierrepont immediately after the conquest. Sir Simon Pierrepont was summoned to parliament 9 Edward II. Of this family was Sir Robert Pierrepont, who was raised to the peerage in 1627-8 by the titles of Baron Pierrepont, of Holme Pierrepont, Viscount Newark, in the county of Nottingham, and Earl of Kingston upon Hull. Henry, his son, was created Marquess of Dorchester in 1645, but dying, in 1680, without issue, the marquisate became extinct. Evelyn, the fourth Earl, was created Marquess of Dor chester in 1706, and Duke of Kingston in 1715, which titles became extinct on the death of the third Duke, Sept. 1773. \u201e.,.., , Philip Meadows, esq. deputy-ranger of Richmond park, son of Sir Philip Meadows, knt. mar shall ofthe king's palace, married in 1734 Frances, only sister and heiress of William Pierrepont, second Duke of Kingston, by whom she had five sons and one daughter, viz. : Evelyn-Philip, Charles, William, Edward, Thomas, and Frances. Charles, who, by royal permission, in 1788, assumed the surname and arms of Pierrepont upon succeeding to the estates of his uncle, the Duke of Kingston ; was elevated to the peerage on the 23rd of July, 1796, by the titles of Baron Pierrepont and Viscount Newark, and, on the first of April, 1806, to the dignity of Earl Man vers His lordship married, in 1774, Anne Orton, youngest daughter of John Mills, of Rich mond, esq. and had issue Evelyn, Henry, Frederick, born in 1775, died in 1801, Charles- Herbert Pierrepont, the present Earl, Henry-Manvers, and Frances- Augusta-Eliza, and died l6th June, 1816 The present Earl was born on the 1 1th of August, 1 778, married, on the 23rd of August, 1 804 Mary-Letitia, eldest daughter of Anthony-Hardolph Eyre, esq. of Grove Park, m the county of Nottingham, by whom he has issue, Charles, Viscount Newark, Sydney-Wilham-Herbert, Mary-Frances, and Annora-Charlotte.

W. by Hazlewood, S. E. by Holbrook, and S. by Makeney and Duffield townships. The township includes the villages of Broadholme, Chevin, Belper-Gutter, Belper-Lane-End, Hopping-Hill, Openwood-gate, Lound-hill, Common-side, Dalley, &c. The houses are substantially built of excellent gritstone, with which the neighbourhood abounds. The thoroughfare through Belper has become considerable, from the facilities afforded by the new line of road opened from Cromford in 1820. This road passes through the centre of the county, and is undoubtedly the best road for carriages of every description ; and we need not scruple to say, it will ultimately, if not immediately, become the direct mail-road between Man chester and London. This road runs through the vale ofthe Derwent, and the scenery on the banks of this river is universally admired. Coaches from London and Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, and Nottingham and Manchester, pass through, to and from those towns, daily. A horse-mail carries the letters from Bakewell, Wirksworth and Belper, to Derby, daily. The market is held on Saturday. Fairs are held here on the 28th of January, the 5th of May, or the day following Chesterfield fair, and on the 31st of October; the latter is a considerable cattle fair. The petty sessions are held weekly, on Saturday, by the county magistrates. Within less than half a century, Belper has attained its present magnitude and importance, having previously been an inconsiderable place, containing within the whole liberty scarcely more than a twentieth part of the houses now occupied by its numerous and busy inhabitants. Ac cording to the census taken in 1821, Belper contained 1239 houses, affording habitations for 3511 male and 3724 female (making in the whole, 7235) inhabitants. This was an increase on the census of 1811 of 1457 persons. In 1831, there were 1482 inhabited and 54 uninhabited houses, occupied by 1604 families, consisting of 3840 males and 4058 females, making a total of 7890 persons; being an increase on the last census, of 655. Ofthe 1604 families, 70 were chiefly em ployed in agriculture, 1229 in trade or handicraft, and 305 variously. Ofthe 1825 males above 21 years of age, 20 were occupiers of land employing, and 21 of ditto not employing labourers; 49 were agricultural labourers, 936 were employed in manufacture, 373 in retail trade, 41 mer chants, professional men or independent, 280 were labourers employed under the three preceding classes, and 98 were retired tradesmen, superannuated, or disabled in body or mind. It may be considered at some future era, a curiosity to show what trades and professions most prevail at the present time in the town of Belper. When the census was taken, there were 1 auctioneer, 13 bakers, 2 besom makers, 6 barbers, 8 blacksmiths, 3 booksellers, 4 brass workers, 7 bricklayers, 6 brickmakers, 4 plasterers, 34 masons, 4 house painters, 30 butchers, 35 carpen ters, 4 cabinet makers, 6 wheelwrights, 6 sawyers, 1 chandler, 1 cheesemonger, 6 chemists and druggists, 2 watchmakers, 7 drapers, 1 silk mercer, 2 coopers, 5 curriers, 1 dyer, 6 crate makers, 2 framesmiths, 4 filesmiths, 4 glaziers, 13 grocers, 1 harness maker, 6 hatters, 1 huckster, 1 iron monger, 1 maltster, 2 millers, 1 pipe maker, 5 printers, 1 6 publicans, 1 rope maker, 2 saddlers, 66 boot and shoe makers, 1 chimney-sweeper, 1 spirit merchant, 5 sinker makers, 26 tailors, 1 tin man, 3 turners, 3 whitesmiths, 1 woolcomber, and many framework-knitters. Remark. The males employed in agriculture appears but few, which arises from a many trades men having land, and partially employing themselves and others who are principally employed in manufacture, and returned as such. The extraordinary accession of inhabitants and buildings is to be attributed to the establish ment ofthe cotton-works belonging to Messrs. Strutt, and to the attention which the members of that public spirited family devote to the accommodation and general welfare of those employed by them. A third of the inhabitants of this town are occupied in their works; and to supply their operatives with clothes and food, a large proportion of the remainder has been induced to fix their residence at Belper. It is thus that towns become extensive and important, by means of a few intelligent individuals engaged in works that add to the wealth of the country. Belper,"], [139, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 115 which at a comparatively recent period was inhabited only by a few nail-makers, now ranks next to the capital of the county in extent, population, wealth and intelligence. Ofthe 1418 families, in 1821, 65 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 1309 in trade or handi craft, and 44 in professional pursuits, &c. The manufactures of Belper are cotton yarn, silk and cotton hose, pottery, nails, &c. The cotton-mills, which belong to Messrs. Strutt, are four in number ; the first of which was erected in the year 1776. The principal of these mills is 200 feet long and 30 wide. It is six stories high, and is considered fire-proof, the floor being constructed on brick arches and paved with brick. The mills are worked by eleven water-wheels, principally composed of iron ; six are used in the time of high water and five when the water is at the usual height. Two of these wheels were constructed by Mr. T. C. Hewes, an ingenious mechanic and engineer of Manches ter ; the other nine have been constructed on the same principle, by the Messrs. Strutt. These wheels are 21 feet 6 inches in diameter, and 15 feet long : each shaft is of cast-iron, and the arms which connect them with the sole (that part of the wheel to which the buckets or ladles are at tached) are simply circular rods of iron, an inch and a half in diameter. The wheels are remarka ble for their simplicity, strength and lightness of appearance. The large cylindrical water-wheel, chiefly composed of timber, has been removed to give place to the iron wheels. Hosiery. \u2014 Messrs. Ward, Brettle and Ward, are the most extensive hosiers in the kingdom. We have already noticed their establishment in the first part. The manufacture of nails was formerly carried on to a considerable extent in this town, and it still supports between three and four hundred hands, but it is thought to be in a declining state. There are also stocking-frames in the town, but they are not numerous. Pottery is made at Belper- Gutter, consisting of pitchers, pans, bottles, &c. : and there are also extensive cotton-mills and bleach-works, and an iron-foundry, at Millford, belonging to the Messrs. Strutt. The extent of the township of Belper is 2858 a. 2 r. 2 p. of gritstone and coal land; the land in the valley, on the banks of the Derwent, is excellent, but the high land is cold and the soil is more barren. Land is let from \u00a3l. to \u00a35. per acre: the average is about \u00a32. The number of freeholders is 176, and the Messrs. Strutt are the largest proprietors. The tithes are taken by composition and the rate made annually. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a37338. 5_. Sir R. P. Jodrell, bart. is the lord of the manor, and holds Court Leets here at irregular periods. The number of persons in this manufacturing place, employed in agriculture, scarcely exceeds one in twenty, in proportion to those persons employed in trade or handicraft pursuits. The wages ofthe agricultural labourers amount to 10.. or 12*. per week, or with victuals, to 6s. or 7*. Here no agricultural labourers are employed in house-row work, as the compulsory labour of pauperage is denominated, nor is any proportion of wages paid out of the poor-rates. The high ways are kept in repair with the composition. The average parochial expenses, during the last seven years, is \u00a31402. 12_. 6d. but this includes poor-rates, church-rates, county-rate and constables' accounts. The pauper children obtain em ployment in seaming, nail-making, and at the cotton manufactories, but they are never apprenticed out. The cases of illegitimate children amount to seven or eight annually. Belper poor-house was erected in 1803; there are about 17 paupers: idiots, old people and orphans in the house. The maintenance ofthe paupers averages about 2s. Qd. per week for each individual. The name of this place was formerly written Beaupoire, and the town has some claims to an tiquity, although it is not mentioned in Doomsday-book. About fifteen years ago, a gold coin of Augustus C\u00e6sar, in high preservation, was found in this neighbourhood: and military weapons, generally thought to be Roman, have been dug up in various places. Several coins have been found ; and two of them of silver, although much de faced, have been judged to be ofthe reigns of Stephen and Edward I. In 25 Edward I. the manor of Beaupoire belonged to the honour of Tutbury. The Inquest post mortem describes a capital mansion held at this place, by Edmund, earl of"], [140, "116 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Lancaster, surnamed Crouchback, who died in 1296 ; and as this is the first mention of the ma nor, it is, in the opinion of Lysons, not improbable that it originated in that nobleman's enclosing a park and building a hunting-seat, to which, from its beautiful situation, he may have given the name of Beau-repaire (or rather, Belle-repaire) which has been corrupted into Belper. In 1 Ed ward III. Thomas, duke of Lancaster, died, and left this manor to his son Henry. It has been handed down by tradition, that John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and son of Edward III. had a residence at Belper. Researches have been made to ascertain this fact, but the tradition remains unconfirmed. A few fragments of old walls, of great thickness, buried in the ground, are discoverable near the building denominated the Manor House ; and this is the site, which, it is believed, was occupied by the Duke's castle or mansion. The same tradition asserts, that the chapel and the old bridge, which had on its front a shield with armorial bearings, were built in his time, and at his expense. Undoubtedly there has, at some period, been a residence of considerable importance on this spot, as the bulk and extent of the foundation walls sufficiently denote. In 7 Henry VII. Ralf Pole of Radbourn died, and left to George, the son of John, the son of Ralf, his kinsman, an estate here. In 16 Henry VIII. Thomas Babington died, and left his son Anthony an estate here. In 2 Edward VI. Thomas Thacker left his son Gilbert an estate here; as did Rowland Babington to his kinsman Francis. In 5 or 6 Philip and Mary, Sir Henry Sacheverel knt. died here, and left an estate to his son John, who died 35 Elizabeth, and left it to his son Henry. In 42 Elizabeth, Anthony Lowe, of Alderwasley, left an estate here to his son Edward.* \u2014 The manor became attached to the Duchy of Lancaster at an early period, and having passed with Duffield, is now the property of Sir Richard Paul Jodrell, bart. The ancient chapel, which is still used for evening lectures and for a school-room, was so small that no more than three hundred persons could be accommodated in it. The service also, for the increasing population of the town, was accustomed to be performed on the alternate Sundays only. Marriages were not solemnized in it. It was on account of this deficiency in the means of divine worship afforded to the friends of the establishment, that the erection of a new church at Belper was resolved upon about nine or ten years ago, and a subscription for that purpose was opened and greatly promoted by the active liberality of the Messrs. Strutt and their families ; who, although from strictly conscientious mo tives they dissented in their mode of worship from the established church, were anxious that their work-people, tenants and neighbours, should be adequately provided with such religious instruc tion and discipline as was suitable to their received impressions or opinions. On the 31st of October, 1822, the first stone of a new church was laid, amid an immense concourse of people. It was on the day of a great annual fair, and the day was uncommonly fine. The Duke of Devon shire, who had announced his intention to officiate at the ceremony of laying the first stone, was met by the delighted multitude at an early hour : his travelling equipage was stopped by the crowd, the horses were taken from the carriage, and his Grace was drawn by the shouting popu lace to Bridge Hill, the residence of G. B. Strutt, esq. where he breakfasted.

The curacy has been considerably augmented, viz.: with \u00a3500. subscribed; royal bounty \u00a3800.; and a parliamentary grant of \u00a32000. The Rev. Matthew Tunstall is the present incumbent. The style of architecture is the English gothic ofthe 13th and 14th centuries, and as it stands on a bold elevation, above the town, its appearance is strikingly ornamental. The design was by Mr. Habbershon, and the contract for the building was executed by Mr. Spicer Crowe, of Lon don. The structure is of solid stone, obtained from a quarry about half a mile from Belper, called Hunger-hill. The gallery is supported by iron pillars. The intersections of the roof-beams and joists, which are elegantly moulded, form a handsome ribbed ceiling, divided into compartments. The height of the tower is 100 feet and the breadth 20, with strong buttresses at the angles, finished at the top with octagon minarets. The body of the church, including the two staircases, is 101 feet long and 56 feet wide, inside measure. The vestry and robing-room are each 13 feet by 10 feet. The height, inside, from the floor to the ceiling, is 30 feet. . There are accommoda tions for 1800 persons, including 300 children, and two-thirds of the sittings are free. The cost ofthe erection was between 11 and \u00a3 12,000. ; about one-third being raised by subscription, to which the Duke of Devonshire, the Messrs. Strutt and several other persons, were large con tributors : the remainder was defrayed by the commissioners for building new churches. There are in this town chapels and congregations of Unitarians, Independents, General Bap tists, Particular Baptists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists. The Methodist old connexion form a large and respectable body of protestant dissenters in this place, and have a handsome chapel on the south side of the town. \u2014 The Unitarian chapel was built chiefly at the expense of the Messrs. Strutt, in 1782. The Rev. D. P. Davies, author of a History of Derbyshire, is the minister. Sunday-schools are held at the church and at each of the chapels. These are supported by voluntary contributions. A Lancastrian day-school, for children of both sexes, has been estab lished on the premises of Messrs. Strutt, to which the scholars pay a penny a week, the remainder of the expenses being liquidated by the founders. These gentlemen have built a school-room capable of holding 500 children ; about 650 children are taught, on the Lancastrian plan, every Sabbath-day, at their expense ; 800 children are taught at the Sunday-schools supported by the Calvinists, Baptists and Methodists ; and there is a charity-school belonging to the church estab lishment, consisting of about 200 children, making a total of 1 650 children who receive instruction at these excellent institutions. The number of Friendly Societies in Belper is five, comprising about 300 members. Charities. Smith's Almshouses. \u2014 Matthew Smith, by his will, bearing date 20th February, 1713, left two almshouses which he had built, and four closes of land, part freehold and part copyhold, lying in the Hoppings, near Hopping-hill, in the liberty of Belper, containing, by estimation, 13 acres: and a pingle, containing half an acre, to George Gregory, esq. of Nottingham, and Thomas Good win, esq. of Derby, and their heirs, to the intent that the yearly rents and profits thereof should be faithfully employed by them, for and towards the relief of two poor people, to be fifty years of age when placed in the said almshouses, the same to be paid to them quarterly. This property is now under the management of Gregory Gregory, esq. of Hungerton hall, co. Nottingham, as the heir of George Gregory, esq. one of the trustees named in the will. The property belonging to the charity consists of two almshouses, situate in Belper, with small gar dens adjoining thereto, and two closes and a pingle in Belper, with an allotment set out in respect thereof, at the time of the enclosure. These lands, containing in the whole 14 a. 0 r. 28 p. ac cording to a late admeasurement, are in the occupation of Samuel Harvey, as yearly tenant, at the rent of \u00a32 1 . per annum. The Rev.

The first stone of the new almshouses was laid by Mr. George Henry Strutt, son of Jedediah Strutt, esq. on the 16th of May, 1829 ; they are now nearly completed, from a handsome design by Messrs. Hutton and Son, surveyors. The estimated cost is \u00a3130.

Strutt. About one mile from Belper, seams of coal are worked to advantage. Bridge-hill house, the seat of G. B. Strutt, esq. a Justice of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Derby, is built on a considerable eminence on the west bank of the Derwent. The situation commands some beautiful views, over an extensive valley through which the Der went flows. The mansion is built of excellent freestone, obtained from the quarries of Messrs. Strutt ; the grounds are laid out with great taste, the gardens are in the highest state of cultiva tion, and what was a few years ago a waste is now converted into a complete paradise. Green-hill house is the residence of Jedediah Strutt, esq. The Messrs. Strutt own several hundred houses, and a valuable tract of land on the banks of the Derwent, extending nearly three miles, in the townships of Belper and Makeney.

These are a wonderful assemblage of huge gritstones, piled upon one another. In ascending the eastern end, prodigious masses of stone present themselves, and a passage six feet in height appears, which formerly went under part of them, but the middle of it has fallen in. Two caverns have been hollowed in these rocks. On every side are seen enormous blocks of stone, and one at the east end is supposed to have been a rocking-stone. \u2014 At the foot of the Rowter or Roo-tor rocks, is a house called Rowter hall, for merly the residence of Mr. Eyre, of Derby, from whom it descended to the lady Massarene, his daughter.

IB."], [151, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 125 Mr. Wilkinson's estates, consisting of about 700 acres, lie in the parishes of Blackwell, South Normanton and Pinxton. It is not unlikely but this family had lands in the parish of South Normanton, a generation or two earlier than the pedigree. Under Blackwell, in an abstract of land in South Normanton, now belonging to Messrs. Downing, and Mr. Blackwall, of Blackwell, we find that 14 Nov. l6i6, Stephen Wilkinson and John Wilkinson, for \u00a3l5\u00a3h enfeoffed William Marriott of lands in South Normanton ; and 9 Sept. 1662, John Wilkinson had an estate at South Normanton conveyed to him and another by Richard Verden, in trust. Bolehill, in Barlow. Bolehill, in Norton parish. Bolehill, is a scattered village on the side of a hill, f of a mile N. E. of, and in the township of Wirksworth. Bolehill, in Eckington parish. Booth, Over and Nether, in Hathersage parish BOLSOVER, a market-town, township, constabulary, and parish, 6|m. S. by E. from Ches- Balsover, terfield, and 155 m. N. by W. from London, in the hundred of Scarsdale, and __>di_bsoi_.rc Bollisovre' archdeaconry of Derby. The parish consists of the township of Glapwell and the villages or places of Oxcroft, Shuttlewood, Stanfrey, and Whalley. The township of Bolsover contained in 1821, 228 houses, 228 families, 60i males, 641 females, or 1245 inhabitants. In 1801, 1091, and in 1811, 1043 inhabitants. Ofthe 228 families, 128 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 70 in trade or handicraft, and 30 in professional pursuits, &c. In 1831, the number of houses was increared to 293, occupied by 329 families, consisting of 684 males, 646 females, or 1330 persons. Ofthe 338 males above 21 years of age, 144 were em ployed in agriculture, 143 in retail trade, &c. and 51 variously. This town was formerly celebrated for its manufacture of steel buckles and spurs. These were made in a very superior manner of the best malleable iron, and then hardened on the surface only, that they might admit of a fine polish. The process of hardening used by the buckle makers is technically termed case-hardening, and is well known amongst those who are connected with the manufacture of articles of steel and iron ; to those who are not, it may be useful to in timate that iron, properly so called, is incapable of receiving a very high polish ; the buckles and spurs were therefore formed and filed into shape when in the state of iron only ; the exterior sur face was then converted into steel by a certain process, in which burnt bones, and ashes made from the leather of old shoes, were generally used : the manufactured article was now internally iron, and therefore not liable to be easily broken, but the exterior surface was converted into the purest steel, and fitted to receive the most brilliant polish that can possibly be imparted to this beautiful metal. Tobacco pipes is now the only manufacture carried on here. The market-day was formerly held on Friday, but it is now fallen into disuse. There is a fair held on Easter Monday. The town is under the government of a constable and headborough. Bolsover town and castle are built on a considerable ridge of yellow limestone rocks, and com mand an extensive, well cultivated valley ; the capital mansions and grounds of Sutton, Hardwick, &c. which together form a group of objects rarely seen in one landscape. It is conjectured that Bolsover was a strong garrison ofthe Danes. On the east side of the town two large ditches or trenches were cut, and a bank of earth was thrown up for defence : these still remain, but at what period they were executed we have no authentic evidence. Bolsover has been considered an im portant station as a place of defence since the conquest, as will be shown in the history of the castle. The township of Bolsover is bounded by Sutton, S. W. Scarcliff, S. E. Cuckney, co. Nott. E. Staveley, W. Clown and Barlborough, N. It contains 4463 acres of tithe free land, chiefly on magnesian limestone of middling quality, divided amongst 180 copyholders. The farms are from 400 acres down to 20, and the rents are considered moderate, the average being about 20.. per acre. Those farmers who are esteemed the best managers pursue the following system of alter-"], [152, "126 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER nate husbandry : they lay down their land in fallow every four or five years, and generally get a crop of turnips at the end of the fallow : they have then, first year wheat ; second, clover ; the third wheat again, and the fourth oats. The land is chiefly arable. The commons were enclosed in 1780. Oxcroft, a manor in the parish of Bolsover, containing 458 a. 0 /-. 32 p. entirely belongs to his Grace the Duke of Devonshire : it is in the constabulary of Bolsover, and it is under the juris diction ofthe manor court of Totley and Dore, belonging to Lord Middleton. The estimated annual value of all the land and buildings is \u00a3479S. 9s. The average parochial expenses for seven years is \u00a3706. 12.. per annum. The pauper children are apprenticed chiefly to farmers, the pauper adults are sent to Ashover workhouse. There are three sick clubs, two male and one female, consisting of about 320 members, seven public houses, a Sunday school, be longing to the church establishment, at which about 160 scholars attend, supported by voluntary contribution, an endowed parochial school, one Independent and one VV'esleyan Methodist chapel in this township. Shuttlewood Spa, in the neighbourhood, is of the same nature as Harrowgate, but weaker : it has been used as a bath, and bears evident marks of antiquity. On the breaking a block of limestone, of a ton and a half weight, in Bolsover field, a toad was discovered alive in the centre, but died immediately upon exposure to the air : no fissure or joint was perceptible. The Duke of Portland is lord of the manor, and holds a court at the Swan Inn on the Friday, every three weeks, besides two great courts within the year. George Walkden, of Mansfield, esq. is the steward of the court, to whom we are indebted for the following curious document re lating thereto. The Customary of Bolsover.

Value in Icing Edward's time 40.?. now ()0s. Robert holds it. D. B. At the conquest, the manor of Bolsover was conferred by William I. on his natural son, Wil liam Peverel. It is probable that the castle was erected during the life of William Peverel, who did not die until the seventh year of the reign of Stephen. A road, still called the Peverel road, commences at Bolsover, in a direction to South Winfield, where the Peverels had another resi dence. The castle was built on the western brow of a range of limestone rocks, at a great eleva-"], [158, "132 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER tion above the valley. It was held in conjunction with the Peak castle under the same constable or governor. William Peverel the younger having poisoned Ranulph, Earl of Chester, in 1153, the castle and manor of Bolsover, together with his other possessions, were forfeited to the crown. In the reign of Richard I. Bolsover was bestowed upon John, afterwards king of England, but then Earl of Mortaigne; and during the absence of Richard in the Holy Land, the castle of Bol sqfres was committed to Richard del Pec. Soon after John's accession to the throne, an expen diture of \u00a330. was ordered for the enclosure of Bolsover park for the king, and in 1204 the go vernment of the castle was bestowed upon William de Briwere. In the ninth year of the same reign, Bryan de l'lsle was constituted governor, and in the ensuing year Nicholas de Chevet held the command. Afterwards it was seized by the disaffected barons, who retained it until 1215, when it was retaken for the king, by William Ferrers, Earl of Derby, who in compensation of this service was appointed the governor. In the seventeenth year of the reign of John, the castle of Bolsover was held by Bryan de l'lsle, who received a mandate in the following year to fortify it against the insurgent barons, or to demolish it. The castle was made a place of defence, and, in the same year, the king appointed Gerard de Furnival to make it his family residence for the better preservation of the peace of the neighbouring districts. Soon after the accession of Henry III. the custody ofthe castles of Peak and Bolsover was given to William, Earl of Derby, who retained the government about six years. The following are the names of the castellans du ring the subsequent twelve years. In the 7th Henry III. Bryan de l'lsle was re-appointed. In 8 Henry III. Robert de Lexing ton ; and in the same year William de Briwere again obtained the command. It was while William de Briwere was castellan, that a conference being held with the barons, in the presence of the king, the archbishop of Canterbury urged the concession in full of the charter obtained during the preceding reign ; and upon this, William de Briwere, who was one ofthe king's council, stood up, and declared that \"those liberties having been by force extorted ought not to be observed.\" The archbishop immediately replied, \" William, if thou didst love the king, thou wouldst not be an impediment to the peace of the realm.\" The young king ob serving that the archbishop was much moved, said, \" We have sworn that they shall be observed, and we will keep our oath.\" In 10 Henry III. Robert de Tateshall was governor. 13 Henry III. to the 17th of the same reign, Bryan de l'lsle again held the castle : and in that year it was for a short time in the hands of Hugh Despenser. It was then governed by Gilbert de Segrave, and afterwards by William, Earl of Derby. About that period, the manor and castle of Bolsover were conferred, as an inheritance under the crown, upon John Scott, Earl of Chester; and he dying without issue, it passed to Ada his fourth sister and co-heiress, who married Henry de Hastings, Lord Abergavenny. In 1243, it was resumed by the crown, an equivalent being made to the possessor ; and twelve years after wards, the government was bestowed on Roger, son of Nigel de Lovetot, then sheriff of the counties of Nottingham and Derby. In 1301, Ralph Pipard held Bolsover and Hareston castles for life. Sir Richard Stury also held Bolsover for life. In 1456, Edmund of Hadhum, Earl of Richmond, and father of Henry VII. died possessed of Bolsover and Hareston. Henry VIII. granted those castles to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk; but they reverted to the crown on the attainder of his son, the second Duke. On the 10th of April, 5 Edward VI. a lease of Bol sover castle, for fifty years, was granted to Sir John Byron, and two years afterwards, the fee farm was granted to George Talbot, knt. Lord Talbot ; and in 1608, Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and others, granted a lease of the manor for one thousand years to Sir Charles Caven dish, knt. for a rent of \u00a310. per annum; and five years subsequently the same Earl, in considera tion of a certain sum of money, sold the manor to Sir Charles, who immediately commenced the erection of the castellated mansion at the north end. The son of Sir Charles, who was so emi nently distinguished for his loyalty during the reign of Charles I. entertained that monarch three times at Bolsover castle. The expense of the first reception was \u00a34,000. of the second nearly \u00a315,000. and ofthe third, which was considered as a slight affair, about \u00a31,500. At the second"], [159, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 133 entertainment, the queen was present. Lord Clarendon, speaking of the first royal visit, says, \" such an excess of feasting as had scarce ever been known in England before, and would be still thought very prodigious, if the same noble person had not, within a year or two afterwards, made the king and queen a more stupendous entertainment (which, God be thanked) though possibly it might too much whet the appetite of others to excess, no man after those days imitated.\" This magnificent host of royalty, had been previously ennobled, and is distinguished in the history of the civil wars, as Earl and Marquess of Newcastle, and at the restoration he was created Duke of Newcastle. The Duchess, in her celebrated memoirs of her illustrious consort, says of the second entertainment, that it was held in the year after the first, which the king liked so well that \" a year after his return out of Scotland, he was pleased to send my Lord word, that her majesty, the queen, was resolved to make a progress into the northern parts, desiring him to prepare the like entertainment for her majesty, as he had formerly done for him, which my Lord did, and en deavoured for it with all possible care and industry, sparing nothing that might add splendour to that feast, which both their majesties were pleased to honour with their presence. Ben Jonson he employed in fitting up such scenes and speeches as he could best devise, and sent for all the gentry of the country to come and wait on their majesties, and, in short, did all that ever he could to render it great, and worthy of their royal acceptance. This entertainment he made at Bolsover, in Derbyshire, some five miles distant from Welbeck, and resigned Welbeck for their majesties' lodging. It cost him between fourteen and fifteen thousand pounds.\" The table linen on this occasion is stated by the Duchess to have cost \u00a3l60. The transactions of that period in which the Earl of Newcastle, as commander-in-chief of the king's forces in the northern and midland districts, was so constantly employed, belong to the general history of the count}', and will be found in the preceding portion of this work. His grandson Henry, the second Duke, died in 1691, without issue, and his estates devolved to his sister and co-heiress, Margaret; this lady married John Holies, Earl of Clare, who, in 1694, was created Duke of Newcastle. Their only daughter, Henrietta, married Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, whose sole heiress, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, brought the manor or barony of Bolsover to William, Duke of Portland, the grandfather ofthe present noble Duke."], [160, "134 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Not a vestige of the ancient Norman structure, erected by William Peverel, is now remaining. It is supposed that the present structure, a square building of brown stone, is erected on the same site on which the ancient castle stood: it is situate at the north west end of the town, on the brink of a high limestone rock that commands a great extent of country. This building, erected at different periods, is of considerable extent, and, from its great elevation, serves as a land-mark for the surrounding country. The oldest part of the present structure (which is now occupied) was erected by the command of Sir Charles Cavendish, about the year lsil3, who designed it evi dently more for a place of abode than a fortification. The interior of this portion of Bolsover castle exhibits a curious specimen of the domestic arrangements and accommodations of the age when it was built. The rooms are small, and the walls are wainscotted and fancifully inlaid and painted. The ceilings of the best apartments are carved and gilt, and the floors are generally of plaster. Bolsover castle, as it now appears, is of singular architecture. Upon passing through some large gates, observes an ingenious writer in the Topographer, \" we soon enter upon the noble terrace (high raised by nature and by art) that forms the western side, and overlooking a fruitful valley, commands the park and seat of Sutton, and a rich circle of country. Along this terrace stands the range of building, now reduced to a shell, built by the Duke of Newcastle. Passing this we come to the house built by his father. A broad flight of steps leads to the entrance, on each side of which are porters' lodges. Having passed these, we enter into a high enclosed pa ved court, where a regular front presents itself in the form somewhat of the letter E : viz. two small wings and a lesser in the centre ; in the latter is the porch, and over the door is a kneeling figure of an Hercules, who supports on his shoulders a heavy balcony ; two lions, sculptured in stone, stand by his side ; above are the arms of Cavendish and a coronet ; and through it a pas sage leads to the hall, which is not large, but perfectly consonant with the building, being sup ported in the centre by two pillars, from whence, and from brackets on the side of the wall, issue the ramifications of the ribbed roof. In the hall there are some old portraits of little or no value, and the labours of Hercules are painted in different compartments. Here is a polished marble slab, and an old oak table, with gilt edges ' Perforated sore, And drilled in holes, the solid oak is found, By worms voracious, eaten through and through.' \" From the hall, through an ante-room, is the entry into the dining-room, now called the draw ing-room, a name it has recently assumed in place of the pillar parlour, by which designation it was formerly known. A circular column of stone in the centre ofthe room supports the ceiling, similar to that in the hall ; round this pillar is the dining table ; the walls are wainscotted, and richly ornamented with many old-fashioned devises, partly gilt, in the manner of James the First's time. Emblematical representations of the five senses, all very indifferently painted, oc cupy various compartments round the top part of the room. The windows are formed and fashioned to correspond with the interior decorations ; the views from the windows are extensive and pleasing ; the chimney-piece of this room is very shewy and expensive (as indeed are those in all the rooms, even the bed-chambers) and as elegant as the ponderous (yet surely magnificent ones) in this reign could be. The staircase is of stone, somewhat in the castle style, though not circular. Above stairs is a noble room, called the star-chamber, rich in all the ornaments of the day, carved and gilt, with painted wainscot, a deep cornice adorned with arms, a rich chimney piece, fine old furniture, and numerous windows, from whence are varied and almost boundless prospects ; the walls are decorated with the portraits of twelve Roman emperors. The many bed-chambers and other apartments are all of the same date and taste, but few have any remain ing furniture. A long and narrow flight of steps leads to the roof, which is of lead, from whence the view is nearly boundless. \" From houses singular, like this, the mind is furnished with new ideas, the imagery and"], [161, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 135 fashion of past ages crowd upon the fancy, and the most pleasing of our intellectual faculties are gratified with a delightful exercise. \" At the head of the first staircase a door opens to the garden wall, which is very broad. It is wide enough to allow three or four persons to walk a-breast, and commands a delightful pros pect.\" In the passage, on a pillar under the dome, are these lines, written by the Rev. W. Tinsley, the present inhabitant of this castle. a Let not each conceited fribble, Whose fingers itch his name to scribble, Dare to pollute these time-tried walls : Bethink thee, how have passed thy fleeting days ? If void of honour \u2014 undeserving praise : On thee nor time, nor fame has calls, Unnoticed mayst thou live \u2014 -unnotic'd die, As weeds that spring, weeds only to supply. \" But you ! ye nobly great ! ye truly wise ! Though virtue, and not fame, you prize, Find here sit tablet for a deathless name : This pile, like you may well defy Each storm that howls along the sky; Its base remains the same, And proudly on its native rock Shall long resist the tempest's shock.\" \" What was wanting in these rooms seems to have been supplied by a range of buildings, which is now in ruins, standing on a noble terrace commanding a magnificent prospect in its full extent ; the side walls and the floor of the apartments, which were entered from the terrace by a grand flight of steps, are all that remain, the roof having been taken off long ago. The proposed extent of this structure may be conceived from the dimensions of the gallery, which is 220 feet in length by 28 feet wide. The dining-room was 78 feet by 33 feet. In it was a picture of the Duke of Newcastle upon horseback. The with-drawing-room was 39 feet by 33. The lodging-room was 36 feet by 33. In it were several portraits, viz. king Charles II. another of the same when a boy ; Sir Charles Cavendish, father of the first Duke of Newcastle ; Henry, the second Duke of Newcastle ; Elizabeth Basset, daughter of William Basset, of Blore, mother of Henry, second Duke of Newcastle, and Charles, Lord Mansfield. There were two entrances into this noble range of buildings. Out of the great court entering the dining-room was a stately door-case. Over the door were cut three coats of arms within the garter. In a scroll were under-written the words ' Cavendo tutus' \" The stables, riding-house, and smithy, erected about the same time, and which form two sides of the outer court, are spacious. The whole range is 276 feet from the east corner of the house. Perhaps it is not possible now to ascertain the exact situation of the ancient castle, which was first built at Bolsover ; but it is probable that it stood near the spot on which the present is erected.\" It has already been observed that Bolsover castle was taken by assault from the rebellious ba rons, in the reign of king John : whether much resistance was made, on this occasion, does not appear. It is, however, very probable that there was a sharp engagement near this fortress, at this or some other time ; for several human bones were found a few years ago on the north-east side ofthe town. Moreover, there are two crosses wrought into the wall which supports the ter race on the west side, about five feet from the ground, and near the first gate-way. The larger is five feet long, and one foot three inches broad ; the other, three feet long and one foot two in ches broad. These once lay flat on the ground as gravestones, and it is more than probable that they were the sepulchral tokens of christians, that, falling in action, were interred at the foot of the wall. Whether there was a chapel then in the garrison, as there was afterwards, is not known ; but supposing the affirmative, these parties, as assailants, were not likely to receive burial there. The crosses are evidently of the same form and style, of a rude sculpture in relief, very ancient, and introduced into the wall at some later period. The small fastening stones, along the top of '.he longer one, are a plain argument of this. The first ofthe masques prepared by Ben Jonson, is entitled Love's Welcome. The King's en tertainment at Welbeck, in Nottinghamshire, a house of the Right Houourub\u0153 William, Earl of Newcastle, Viscount Mansfield, Baron of Bothal and Bolsover, eye. at his going into Scotland, 1 633. Gifford, in his edition of Jonson's Works, says, \" The object was merely to introduce, in a kind of anti-masque, a course of Quintain, performed by the gentlemen of the county, neighbours to"], [162, "136 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER this great Earl, in the guise of rustics, in which much awkwardness was affected, and much real dexterity probably shown.\" The game or diversion of Quintain is thus described by Dr. Ken net : They set up a post perpendicularly in the ground, and then placed a slender piece of timber on the top of it, on a spindle, with a board nailed to it on one end and a bag of sand on the other. Against this board they rode with spears. Dr. Plott writes that he saw it at Deddington, in Ox fordshire, where only strong staves were used ; which, violently bringing about the bag of sand, *f they made not good speed away, it struck them on the neck and shoulders, and sometimes per haps knocked them off their horses.\" The entertainment is for the most part quaint and ludicrous, and the contest at Quintain is given in honour of the union of the Lord-Lieutenancy of the two counties of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in the person of the Earl of Newcastle. This union is represented by a marriage, with Bold Stub, of Sherwood, and Pem, the daughter of Father Fitz-Ale, herald of Derby. From the introductory part we quote the following verses : \" We come with our peers, And crave your ears, To present a wedding, Intended a bedding Of both the shires. Father Fitz-Ale Hath a daughter stale In Derby town Known up and down For a great antiquity : And Pem she hight, A solemn wight As you should meet In any street In that ubiquity. Her he hath brought As having sought By many a draught Of ale and craft, With skill to graft In some old stock Of the yeoman block And forest blood Of old Sherwood. And he hath found Within the ground, At last, no shrimp Whereon to imp His jolly club But a bold Stub O' the right wood, A champion good ; Who here in place Presents himself Like doughty elf Of Greenwood chase.\" The combatants, or rather, riders at the Quintain, are named Red-hood, Blue-hood, Tawny hood, Motley-hood, and Russet-hood. It is probable that in these characters some general allu sion was intended to the parties into which the politics of the state were then divided ; but we will not pretend to decipher these mummeries, although we may venture to surmise, that by Tawny-hood is meant the Presbyterians or the puritans. Tawny-hood's course (at the Quintain.) Well run, Tawny, the abbot's churl, His jade gave him a jerk, As he would have his rider hurl His hood after the kirk. But he was wiser, and well behest, For this is all that he hath left. The piece concludes with an eulogium on Charles, in blank verse, from which we extract the following fine passage, the very flattery of which ought to have taught the unhappy monarch what he ought to have been. u \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 such a king As men would wish, that knew not how to hope His like, but seeing him ! A prince, that's law Unto himself; is good for goodness' sake. And so becomes the rule unto his subjects ! That studies not to seem or to show great, But be: \u2014 not drest for other's eyes and ears, With visors and false rumours, but makes fame Wait on his actions, and thence speak his name.\" The masque performed, the next year (30th July, 1634) at Bolsover, at the grand entertain-"], [163, "137 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. ment before King Charles and his Queen, was entitled Love's Welcome. This little piece seems to be given very imperfectly in the works of its eminent author. It commences with a piece suno \" by two tenors and a bass,\" while the king and queen sat at banquet. After the banquet their majesties were entertained with dialogues and dances of mechanics, in which Ben Jonson vents his spleen against Inigo Jones, the architect, whom he introduces under the appellation of Colo nel Vitruvius. A second banquet was then set down before the king and queen \" from the clouds by two Loves, Eros and Anteros : one as the king's, the other as the queen's, differenced by their garlands only : his of white and red roses, the other of lilies interwoven, gold, silver, purple, &c. with a bough of palm in his hand cleft a little at the top ; they were both armed and winged ; with bows and quivers, cassocks, breeches, buskins, gloves and perukes alike. They stood silent awhile, wondering at one another, till at last the lesser of them (Eros) began to speak.\" Their conversation, which is fantastical and metaphysical, is in rhyme ; and is interrupted by Phila lethes, who tells them, that should they swear to these refined reasons and proportions of the affections, they \" would hardly get credit above a fable, here, in the edge of Derbyshire, the region of ale.\" The same character concludes the masque with a complimentary address to their ma jesties in prose. The fountain at Bolsover is situate in a small garden adjoining the old house, or what used to be called the little house, at Bolsover : it stands in an octagon reservoir six feet deep, which re ceived the water from the images and heads placed in the angles and sides. Four of these figures resemble griffins standing upon semicircular pedestals ; they are made of stone, and well executed : in the other four angles are figures like satyrs sitting astride on birds, probably eagles ; but they are now so mutilated, that their precise shape is not to be made out ; on the sides are arched niches, in which are busts of eight of the Roman emperors, made of alabaster. In the centre is a square rusticated pedestal, with ornaments projecting from the angles. Towards the middle, is a cistern which was to receive the water from the masks on the sides of the pedestal, through which pipes are conveyed : the sides of this cistern are ornamented with good sculpture ; in the centre is a marquess' coronet over the Cavendish crest ; on each side of it hangs a bunch of fruit, which two birds are pecking at ; at the corners are heads of eagles, which spouted out water ; on the top of the pedestal is a statue of Venus in alabaster ; she has wet drapery in her hand, with one foot on a kind of step, in the act of getting out of a bath. The water that supplied this curious fountain was brought by pipes from a spring about two hundred yards north of the gar den, and which filled a leaden cistern adjoining to the garden wall, whence it was conveyed by pipes to the fountain. In the civil wars the houses of the Duke of Newcastle were pulled down and disfurnished, of which the furniture here, and at Welbeck, was particularly rich, and one suit of linen alone, bought for the king's entertainment here, cost \u00a3l60. At this period Bolsover castle was a garri- son under the command of Colonel Muschamp. The following account of its capture by the par- liamentary forces, is given in a Parliamentary Chronicle, published by Vicars, entitled the Burning Bush not Consumed. \" Shortly after August 16, 1644, the noble Major-General having left Colo- nel Bright, a commander of my Lord Fairfax's, and a party of foot in the castle (Sheffield) by order from the most noble Earl of Manchester, advanced towards Bolsover castle, about eight miles from Sheffield. It being another strong house of Marquesse Newcastle's, in Derbyshire, which was well manned with soldiers, and strengthened with great guns, one whereof carried eighteen pound bullets, others nine pound, and it had strong works about it ; yet this castle also, upon summons, was soon rendered up to my Lord's forces, upon fair and moderate articles granted to them. It pleased God to give us, in this castle of Bolsover, an hundred and twenty muskets, besides pikes, halberts, &c. Also one iron drake, some leaden bullets, two mortar pieces, some other drakes, nine barrels of powder, with a proportion of match, some victuals for our soldiers, and some plunder.\" The parliament, who had seized it on account ofthe delinquency of its noble proprietor, Wil liam, Earl and afterwards Duke of Newcastle, sold it, and part of it was pulled down, but Sir T"], [164, "138 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Charles Cavendish, his younger brother, finding means to re-purchase it of the parliamentarians at an advanced price, prevented the total demolition of it. Huntingdon Smithson, an architect who has been honoured with the notice of Horace Walpole, is understood to have furnished the designs of Bolsover castle, but he did not live to witness its erection. He collected his materials from Italy, where he was sent by the Duke of Newcastle for the purpose. Smithson died at Bolsover in the year 1648, and was buried in the chancel of the church, where there is a poetic inscription to his memory, in which his skill in architecture is a principal feature. Walpole says, that \" Many of his drawings were purchased by the late Lord Byron from his descendants, who lived at Bolsover:\" hence it appears that he was a man of con siderable eminence in his profession. The immense pile of building that his genius contributed to produce, is gradually, though slowly, wearing away. Trees now grow in some of the apart ments, and the ivy creeps along the walls ; but there is nothing strikingly picturesque in any part of the structure which is now in ruins. The best view of Bolsover castle is from the road, on the north-east entrance into the town, from a place called Iron Cliff. From the Chesterfield road below, a good view of the whole structure may be obtained, but the almost total want of majestic trees and luxuriant foliage, renders it but an indifferent subject for the pencil. \" A broad terrace commences at the northern extremity of Bolsover castle, and extends along the whole front of the building ; it then sweeps round the southern side of the village, and in clines towards the east. On the right border of this terrace four watch-towers yet remain ; they stand on the brow of a natural rocky rampart, that terminates against the ridge of hill along which we had just passed in our walk from Hardwick through Glapwell and Palterton. Where this junction takes place an artificial rampart, with a deep ditch, commences and spans the other half of Bolsover from the south to the north-east.\" Bolsover church is a plain Norman structure, with a tower terminated by a low spire, dedicated to St. Mary. The living is a vicarage, of the clear value of \u00a3 14. and yearly tenths 11_. ll\u00b1d. It has been augmented by \u00a3200. subscribed, and \u00a310. per annum rent charge, given by the Earl of Oxford in 1716, Royal Bounty \u00a3400. in 1728, and a Parliamentary grant of \u00a3200. and is now worth about \u00a3130. per annum. There was a church at Bolsover in the reign of Henry II. It was then given by William Peverel, of Nottingham, to the Abbey of Darley. The present pa- tron is the Duke of Portland, and the incumbent is the Rev. William Tinsley. In the church is an ancient sculpture, discovered about 120 years ago, which served as a step to the north door of the church. On the lower side of the stone was discovered an ancient rude sculpture of very high relief, representing the nativity of our Saviour. The Virgin Mary ap- pears to be sitting in a stable, with a mutilated figure of the infant Jesus in her lap, who seems to have had one hand on a dove. The three figures standing round the Virgin Mary are probably intended to represent the wise men of the East, when they fell down and worshipped the infant Jesus, and opened their treasures, presenting unto him gifts ; gold, frankincense and myrrh. The two camels' heads are looking over or into the manger; the great projection of these heads is very singular. The stone is five feet by three, and appears, from the drapery and other parts of the sculpture, to be the work of the twelfth or thirteenth century. It was then probably held in high estimation ; and from the situation in which it was found, we are led to suppose it was put there as a place of safety during the frequent attacks that were made on Bolsover castle. In a small chapel on the south side of the church, which has been added to the original building, there are some costly monuments. On the entrance into the monument room, over the door, is the date when it was built, A.D. 1618 ; and above are the Cavendish arms and crest. On the outside of the church, on the battlements, is cut in wrought iron, in capital letters, the family motto, Cavendo tutus\u2014 Secure from Caution. On the dexter side are the Cavendish arms, three Stags' heads caboshed, a crescent for difference. On the sinister side the arms of 0\"_e, a fesse between three crescents, and above the last, on a wreath, a rose. Within this room are two fine monuments, one in memory of Sir Charles and Lady Cavendish. Under a Grecian arch, is an altar-tcmb, on which is an effigy of a knight in armour, his own hair, hands in a praying p'os-"], [165, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 139 ture, &c.

His Posteritie of Him to Strangers. Charles Cavendish was a man whom Knowledge, zeal, sincerity, made religious ; Experience, discretion, courage, made valiant ; Reading, conference, judgment, made learned; Religion, valour, learning, made wise; Birth, merit, favour, made noble ; Respect, means, charitie, made bountiful ; Equitie, conscience, office, made just; Nobilitie, bountie, justice, made honourable; Counsell, ayde, secrecie, made a trustie friend; Love, truth, constancie, made a kind husband; Affection, advice, care, made a loving father ; Eriends, wife, sonnes, made content ; Wisdom, honour, content, made happy. From which happiness he was translated to the better, on the 4th April, 1617, yet not without the sad and weep- ing remembrance of his sorrowful lady, Katherine, second daughter to Cuthbert, late Lord Ogle, and sister to Jane Essent, Countess of Shrewsbury. She of her piety, with her two surviving sons, have dedicated this humble monu- ment to his memory, and do all desire, in their time, to be gathered, expecting the happy hour of resurrection, when these garments here putting off, shall be put on glorified. Another monument to the memory of Henry Caven- dish, Duke of Newcastle, &.. is composed of different coloured marbles. In design it is architectural; from the base rises four columns, which supports a magnificent pediment, ornamented with two white marble figures; emblematic devices, inscriptions, and a variety of deco- rative sculpture are scattered about this splendid monu- ment. To the memory of these, her ancestors and relations, this monument was erected by the direction of the Right Hon. the Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holies Harley, Countess of Oxford, and Countess Mortimer, 1726. In this vault underneath are deposited the remains of the Most Noble Henry Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, who died at Welbeck, 12th August, 1691, aged 60 years. Frances, his wife, died at London, 23rd September, 1695. Margaret, third daughter, and heir to the above, and wife to the Most Noble John Holies, Duke of Newcastle, was interred 5th January, 1716.

Here also lyeth the body of Huntingdon .mithson, gent, who departed this life May 25th, 17-1, in the 4/th year of his age. Bassano mentions the monument of Anthony Lowe, who died 1643. This was Anthony Lowe, son and heir of Edward Lowe, of Alderwasley, esq. : he was in the ser vice of the king, and probably with the Earl of Newcas tle's forces, in 1643, when he died. On the right hand wall of the chancel is the figure of a fe- male kneeling, and underneath is a Latin inscription \u2014 Hie jacet Helena Deane, uxor Georgii Deane, magistri in arte Chirurgic\u0153 et Annatomica de civitate Lboraciem nuper ibidem questores Urbini .. in arte Medica exercitat obiit mortem the 24th die Maii, anno dom. 16_7, \u00e6etatis su\u00e6 58, mascimar et morimare.

The second Duke, William, eldest son of the former, added to the pos- sessions of the family, the castle and lordship of Bolsover and other estates of Derbyshire, by his marriage with Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, the daughter of Edward Harley, the second Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, and who was by her mother, Henrietta Cavendish Holies, the sole representative of the Newcastle branch of the Cavendish family, the titular honours of which had become extinct in 1711. The third Duke of Portland was also the eldest son of his father, to whose honours he succeeded in 1762. His Grace took a considerable share in the political affairs during the long and interesting reign of George III. and was twice at the head of the adminis- tration. The present Duke, the fourth who has possessed the title, succeeded his father in 1809 : his name and titles are William Henry Cavendish Scott Bentinck, F. R. S. and S. A. Duke of Portland, Marquess of Tichfield, in the county of Southampton ; Earl of Portland, in the county of Dorset ; Viscount Woodstock, of Woodstock, in the county of Oxford, and Baron Cirencester, of Cirencester, in the county of Gloucester. His Grace was born 24th June, 1?6S, and married 4th August, 1795. His Grace is Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Middlesex, and one of the trustees ofthe British Museum. As an agriculturist his Grace has distinguished himself by con- verting wastes into fertile enclosures, and by giving employment to the labourer he has at once improved his estates and benefited his country. William Henry, Marquess of Tichfield, his Grace's eldest son, died on the 4th March, 1824, in the 28th year of his age, greatly lamented, and William John, the second son, is now Marquess of Tichfield. u"], [172, "146 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER BONSALL, a village, township, constabulary and parish, situate in a romantic valley, amidst Bunteshall, abrupt limestone rocks, and watered by a beautiful trout stream, l\\ m. W. of Cromford, and 3 m. N. W. of Wirksworth, is in the hundred of Wirksworth and deanery of Ash bourn. The township includes the little villages of Brightgate and Slaley, and contained, in 1821, 302 houses, 326 families, and 1396 inhabitants. Of the 326 families, 49 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 241 in trade and handicraft, and 36 variously. The trade carried on here is smelting of lead, framework-knitting, lace-running, manufacturing colours, combs, &c. Frame work-knitters, of which there are fifty, mining, and the Cromford cotton-mills, employ the ma jority of the labouring class. The township consists of 2384 acres of limestone land, including 1203 a. 1 r. 8 p. of newly en closed, by Acts of Parliament obtained in 1774 and 1776, divided among about 150 copyholders. The land, which is principally meadow and pasture, is divided into small farms, at an average rental of \u00a32. per acre. The average of seven years parochial expenses is \u00a3524. 13s. ; this includes the poor and county-rate, constables' accounts, &c. The church-rate averages about \u00a350. per annum. The highways are assessed separately. There is no work-house, consequently the paupers are sent to Alstonfield, in Staffordshire. The pauper children are seldom apprenticed out. The copyholders pay the rector \u00a3100. per annum in lieu of tithes. Besides the endowed free-school, there are Sunday-schools at the church and Baptist chapel, supported by voluntary contributions. There are three Friendly Societies, consisting of 240 members, and six victuallers in the township. In the Doomsday Survey, Bonteshall is described as a hamlet, of the manor of Metesford (the site of which is not known) and was part of the king's lands or field. In 25 Edward I. Edward, Earl of Lancaster, held the manor; he died in 1296, seised of the manor of Upper Bonsall, formerly belonging to the crown, and Nether Bonsall, which had been parcel of the honour of Tutbury. These manors became united, and continued annexed to the earldom and duchy of Lancaster until 1630, when Charles I. granted them to Charles Harbord, esq. and others, reserving a fee-farm rent. In 1632 they were sold to Henry, Earl of Dover; and in 1633 he sold his interest in them to the copyholders, subject to the same fee-farm rent. In 10 Henry VIII. Thomas Babington died, and left an estate in Bonsall to his son Anthony. In 19 Henry VIII. Francis Leech died, and left his son Francis an estate; and 4 Edward VI. Ralf Leech died, and left the same to his three daughters, Joan, Elizabeth and Margaret. In 18 Henry VIII. Roger Foljambe, esq. died, and left his estate here to his son Godfrey; the said Godfrey dying, 5 Edward VI. left the same to his son Godfrey. Sir William Cavendish, knt. left an estate here to his son Henry. Sir Henry Sacheverell left an estate here to his son John. 10 Elizabeth, Richard Blackwall, esq. died, and left to his son William an estate at Bonsall. The family of Hopkinson had a considerable freehold and copyhold estate in this parish, as early as the reign of Henry V. They became extinct the latter end of the seventeenth century. The Femes were also a family of name and substance heiv. Robert Feme, esq. who built the school house, with a dwelling-house for the master, in 1718, was ancestor of Henry Feme, esq. Receiver General of the Customs; the latter possessed considerable property in this parish, and also the largest share of the manor, which descended to his daughter and co-heir, Elizabeth, the wife of Edmund Turnor, esq. of Stoke Rochford, in the county of Lincoln. Isabel, their daughter, mar ried Major General Alexander Dury (killed at the siege of St. Cas, in 1758.) and it is now the inheritance of his son and heir, Alexander Dury, esq. of Hadley, in the county of Middlesex. In 1620. It is decreed that the freeholders and copyholders of Bonsall, time out of mind, paid an ancient rent, called Weanemolle or Weanmill rent, of \u00a33. 18.. 6d. to his Majesty, which was not in charge to the reeve, but in charge of his Majesty's bailiff and receiver of his soccage rents, within the wapentake of Wirksworth. The king's copyhold tenants in Bonsall and Slaley, claimed and allowed, by same decree, to have for every ox-gang, common of pasture for 40 sheep ; and after the same proportion, common of pasture for all manner of cattle, on, &c. called Moor butts, Blackemeare, Leys-yate, White-low, to Grange-edge, Tow-meare, Cotter-slacke, Shot-"], [173, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 147 walls, Gorsie-dale, Long-tor end, Smalethorn-edge, Blacklow-tower, Wensley-side, Breach-yate, Crow-stones, Blacklow-slacke, Ball-ley, Stow-low, Finnes, Latter'd way, Ewen-slacke, Fenny ford, Stony-way, Monks-wall, Hember, Masson-eves, alias March-den, Cockshut-low, and the Upper-dale, and all other commons, wastes, heaths and common-ground whatsoever, in the manor or lordship of Bonsall or elsewhere, wherein or whereupon the said copyholders of Bonsall afore said and Slaley, or either of them, used to have common, &c. \u2014 The same decree regulates the steward's fees.

James Hall, and the heirs of Anthony Greensmith. In 1625, Peter Bradshaw, citizen and merchant tailor, of London, devised Bontesall, otherwise Bonsall mill, which he had purchased of his Majesty's contractors, to his fourth son, Paul. About the latter end of the 1 7th century, Mr. Thomas Statham, steward of this manor, incurred a bill of upwards of \u00a330. in attempting to obtain a Charter for a market here, but did not suc ceed. At this time it is probable the stone cross and steps were erected in the town street, in the large open place where they now stand. The following particulars relating to this manor are extracted from a brief in possession of Mr. T. N. Ince, of Wirksworth.

To be heard in court, April 16, 1719- In the bill of Mr. Feme, exhibited to the Lord Chancellor, he says he has been Lord of the manor of Bonsall, &c. for 8 or 9 years. That he had appointed a steward (William Turner, of Derby, attorney) but he was hindered, and Gervase Balguy, attorney, a defendant, of Wirksworth, had been, by or for defendants, appointed steward, &c. That defendants, John Beresford, esq. and Arthur Dakeyne, esq. pretended to have no title, but pretended they were trustees, &c. Prays that a discovery of writings, papers, &c. may be made. Defendants deny plaintiff's right to the manor, &c. That King Charles I. was seised thereof and granted the same to Charles Harbord, esq. and some other persons and their heirs, on which grant a certain yearly rent was reserved to the crown. That it was afterwards purchased from the grantees by the copyholders of Bonsall, who raised and paid proportionate sums of money for the same, and so they became seised thereof. That by several mesne conveyances it is now in Beresford and Dakeyne, in trust, &c. Have heard that plaintiff Feme hath endeavoured to prevail on the trustees to convey it to him, &c. Charles I. in right ofthe crown or duchy of Lancaster, was seised ofthe manor of Bonsall, &c. and by letters patent, under the great seal and duchy seal, dated 4 October, 1630, in considera tion of (inter alia) \u00a315. is. 3f<_. rent, did grant and convey the said manor to Charles Harbord, esq. Christopher Fewell and Thomas Young, gentlemen, and their heirs, as a fee farm. The said Charles Plarbord, esq. by deeds duly enrolled in chancery, dated 17 May, 8 Charles I. did grant and convey the manor Of Bonsall, &c. except the said rent and some other things then mentioned, to Henry, Earl of Dover, and his heirs, with provision for payment of the said rent of \u00a315. is. Sfd. Which said Henry, Earl of Dover, by deed, enrolled 20 May, 9 Charles I. for and upon certain considerations and agreements then mentioned, and particularly in consideration of \u00a3300. to him paid by George Hopkinson, Henry Statham and Francis Granger, did grant and convey the said manor, &c. to them, the said Hopkinson, Statham and Granger, and their heirs,"], [174, "148 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER with the like provision as to the fee farm rent. Which was so conveyed to them in trust, and on the behalf of all the copyholders of the said manor, or such of them as should pay their propor tion of the purchase money and expenses, which defendants believed they all did. And on 9 October, 14 Charles I. articles of agreement were entered into between the said Hopkinson and Granger, of one part (Statham being dead) and Dorothy Hopkinson, on behalf of her infant son Anthony (the son of Henry Hopkinson deceased) William Woolley, and others, of the other part, which agreement recites the Earl of Dover's conveyance to the said trustees, &c. George Hopkinson, surviving trustee on request, as aforesaid, did, on 6 October, 13 Charles II. for considerations then mentioned, and especially for the sum of \u00a361. i3s. Id. paid proportion ably, &c. convey the said manor to William Keys, Joshua Hill, Roger Newton, Thomas Beigh ton, Henry Feme and Richard Buxton, and their heirs on said trusts, who entered on a similar agreement (the same day) as above recited. They continued to act as Lords until about 1 695, when all but Henry Feme being dead, Henry Feme of Kniveton, gentleman, John Beresford of Ashbourn, esq. Arthur Dakeyne of Stubbing Edge, gentleman, Cornelius Dale of Flagg, gentle man, William Hodgkinson of Overton, gentleman, Henry Balguy of Derwent, esq. and Anthony Alsop of Cowley, gentleman, were nominated trustees, and had the same assigned to them by the said Henry Feme, 24 October, 1695. (Most ofthe deeds, &c. are enrolled, and were in the hands of different individuals named in the brief.) That Gervase Balguy had been steward 3 or 4 years, having been clerk to Sir John Statham, the previous steward. That plaintiff Feme got Dale and Hodgkinson to convey the interest to him, but without the consent of the copyholders, and there upon appointed Mr. W. Turner his steward, &c. That Balguy and Alsop, two of the trustees, were dead, &c. By the proofs \u2014 It appears by William Hopkinson's evidence that Mr. Thomas Statham, when steward, had a bill of \u00a330. in attempting to make Bonsall a market town. Sir John Statham, son of Thomas and great-grandson of Henry, who was steward in the reign of Charles I. con firmed the evidence of Hopkinson. Anthony Bradshaw proves execution of Dale and Hodgkinson's deed to Henry Feme, also Samuel Eccles proves execution of the deed bearing date 30 October, 1703, from Mr. Robert Feme, father ofthe plaintiff, deceased. William Hopkinson stated himself to be the grandson of George Hopkinson, first trustee, and that when his grandfather assigned the trust, 13 Charles II. as aforesaid, the \u00a361. 13_. Id. was not paid to him as a consideration for his so doing, but in dis charge of what was due to him for business done for the town's use. \u2014 In the brief is an account of the different sums, and by whom paid, towards the \u00a36l. 13*. Id. to George Hopkinson, 13 Charles II. The manor or royalty of Bonsall belongs to the proprietors of the copyhold property within that manor, proportionably according to the amount of a certain fine or copyhold rent, payable by each person for his copyhold tenement, the whole amount of which fine or rent is about \u00a315. The copyholders or lords of the manor being in consequence very numerous, trustees are ap pointed by them for transacting the business of the manor with greater facility, and in whose names the Courts Leet and Courts Baron are held. James Milnes, of Matlock, esq. is the steward. The church stands on a hill, and is a gothic structure, with a tower, terminated by a handsome spire, dedicated to St. James. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a39. 1 6s. Oia*. and yearly tenths 19s. l^d. The glebe land belonging to the living is 61 a. 1 r. and the parish ioners pay to the rector \u00a3100. in lieu of tithe. The Dean of Lincoln is the patron. The Rev.

In 15 Edward I. Stephen de Grendon held one half of the manor under the Duchy of Lancaster, after Ferrers forfeited his lands, and left it to his daughter Joan. Roger de Ridware, who had married the other co-heiress of Reginald, held the other half. In 36 Edward III. Margaret Zouch died, and left Roger, the son of Roger de Saperton, her heir, half of the manor, and the advowson of the church, and Walter de Ridware held the other half. Ridware conveyed his part to John de Bassinges, whose heiress married Waldeshelf ; one of the co-heiresses of the latter brought this estate again to the family of Ridware ; the heiress of Ridware brought it to the Cottons. The latter family were in possession ofthe estate for several generations. In 21 Henry VII. Thomas Cotton, son and heir of Richard Cotton, esq. died and left Elizabeth, his daughter and heir, his half of the lordship. In 1609 Sir Humphrey Ferrers died seised of this portion of the manor. In 1664 the latter sold it to the Challoners : from the Challoners it passed by marriage to the Rev. Thomas Gilbert, who, in 1743, sold it to John Gilbert Cooper, esq.

The other part of the manor passed from the Sapertons to the Agards. In 7 Eliz. Clement Agard, esq. died, and left his half of the manor to his son William, and it continued in that family until the reign of Charles II. when the male branch became extinct. It was purchased by John Gisborne, of Derby, esq. and his son John owned it in 1712. The family of Bate afterwards possessed this portion ofthe manor. Brownlow Bate, esq. sold this estate in 1761 to Mr. Broad hurst ; and John Broadhurst, of Foston hall, esq. is the present proprietor. In 26 Henry VIII. William, Lord Mountjoy died, and left his son Charles, Lord Mountjoy, an estate here. The parish church is an ancient and humble structure, with a tower, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a349. and yearly tenths 12..

Of the 68 families, 50 were chiefly employed in agriculture, and 18 in trade or handicraft. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a32651. 12*. In the reign of king John the manor belonged to the family of Heriz. In 1369, Sir Richard Willoughby held it under the Deincourts. It shortly after this became the property of the Revels, who resided at Ogston hall for many generations. The sisters and co-heiresses of William Revel, esq. who died in 1706, married Richard Turbutt, of Doncaster, esq. and Sir Paul Jenkinson, of Walton, near Chesterfield, bart. Nearly the whole of this township is now the property of William Turbutt, esq. Sir Robert Wilmot, of Chaddesden, bart. is the lord ofthe manor. The ancient chapel, situate about three quarters of a mile from the village, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It was formerly served only once a month by the rector of Morton, but having been augmented by the Royal Bounty, it is become a distinct benefice, and has regular service weekly. It is not parochial, not having the right of sepulture or baptism ; the minister is ap pointed by the rector of Morton.

The manor was part of Henry de Ferrers' lands at the Doomsday Survey, and was held under that family at an early period by the family of Caus, or de Cauceis. After the fall of the Ferrers' family, this manor was held by the Bakepuzes. In the reign of king John, it was conveyed to Godard de Bradbume, and it continued in this family until the reign of Edward VI. In 1207, Roger de Bradbume held the manor of Bradbume, and lands in Hough and OfFdecote. Henry de Bradbume, eldest son of Sir Roger, was executed at Pomfret, in 1322, for his adherence to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, when the manor passed to his younger brother, John, and his de scendants. In 13 Henry VIII. Humphrey de Bradbume, esq. died, and left Hough and Brad bourn to his son John. In 23 Elizabeth, Sir Humphry Bradbume died, and left Hough and Bradbourn to his son William. Here was anciently a seat of the family of Bradbume, of whom the last Sir Humphry lies buried under a handsome altar-tomb in Ashbourn church. His co heir, Jane, marrying Sir Humphry Ferrers, of Tamworth, was mother of Sir John Ferrers, who died in 1633, from whom this estate descended to the Baroness de Ferrers, who married George, Marquess of Townshend; the latter family sold this manor, in 1809, to Philip Gell, of Hopton hall, esq. for \u00a385,000. and he is the present proprietor. The ancient church has a Norman square tower, embattled, with sculptured heads round the string-courses. It is dedicated to All Saints. This church was given to the priory of D unsta ble,* in 1205, by Sir Geoffrey de Cauceis, whose gift was confirmed by William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, as chief lord of the fee. It was appropriated to the priory in 1278, and a vicarage was endowed in 1330. In 1608, the rectory was granted to Rogers and another, who sold most of the tithes to the several land owners. In 1609, the rectory house and glebe lands were purchased by Mr. George Buxton, ancestor of the Rev. German Buckston, the present vicar. The living is a vicarage, of the clear value of \u00a332. 3*. and yearly tenths, l6s. id. The present value is about \u00a3120. per annum. The Duke of Devonshire is the patron. The font is ancient : and a part of an old cross, on which some rude figures are sculptured, is now converted into a gate-post. On one of the pews, which is said to have belonged to the Bradbume family, there are some curious carved heads, animals and grotesque figures, on the oak pannels, worthy of remark. The chancel is kept in repair by the owners of the white tithe. The windows have been ornamented with stained glass. In one of the chancel windows are these arms Argent, a chevron, between three horse-shoes. Sable. \" Lysons gives the following extract from the Chronicle of the Annals of Dunstable. \" When the church was given to the priory, it had a rector and two vicars. In 1214, the Prior had a suit in the court at Rome, with the rector and vicars, with a view, as it is supposed, of displacing them. It was alleged, that Robert, the rector, was son of Godfrey, a former rector ; that Henry, one of the vicars, was son of John, his predecessor, in one mediety of the vicarage; and that William, the other vicar, kept a concubine publicly, and went a hunting, forsaking his tonsure and clerical duties. When the church became vacant, the convent sent one of their canons, who resided at Brad bourn, under the name of a custos or warden, accounted with the priory for the profits, and provided for the cure of the church and its chapels, many years before the rectory was actually appropriated to the priory.\" The Prior kept a great flock of sheep in this parish, and in the Annals before referred to it is stated, that 800 died in the year 1243"], [181, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 155 Arms and Inscriptions in the Church. In memory of Thomas Buckston, esq. who died in the year 1811, aged 87, many years captain in the Royal Marines, during which period he served in many engage ments, and lived to be one of the oldest officers of his Majesty's service. He was formerly a lieutenant in the 30th regiment of foot, and was at the battle of Culloden, in 1745 ; a man warmly attached to his family and friends, charitable and religious in his principles and conduct.

Here also resteth in humble hope of a joyful resurrec tion, the remains of George Buckston, esq. whose truly christian piety and cheerfulness, together with a warm and benevolent heart, will long endear his memory to his surviving friends. He married Sarah, one of the co heiresses of Richard Peacock, of Rodgley, and died 8th April, 1810, aged nearly 89. John Buxton, of Ballidon, died 23rd August, 1783, aged 63 ; and Elizabeth, his wife, sister to Rev. Mr. Roe, died 12th February, 1806, aged 80. John Buxton, of Ballidon, died 1st Mar. 1805, aged 48. Parish Registers \u2014 The earliest Register is a small parchment book, beginning 1713, and ending June, 1729. The Rev. Robert Gettliffe (who was vicar of Bradbourn during this period and for several years after) in many instances made entries in this Register after the manner of the Quakers, denoting the month by its number instead of its name ; reckoning March the 1st month \u2014 for in stance \u2014 \" Sarah, daughter of Thurstan and Hannah Dale, baptized 10' 13th 1721,\" means that she was bap tized 13th of December, or 10th month.

It appears from a Deed, of the year 1256, that the Buxton family then spelt their name de Bawkestone ; they were originally settled at Buxton, but removed to Brassington in consequence of a marriage with the heiress of Lane ; and about two centuries ago, from Brassington to Brad bourn. In the first edition of Camden's Britannia, in the margin, are the arms. Several of this family have been benefactors to the poor. In the mysteries of York, 3 Henry V. (1415.) one of this family, Mr. Thomas Buxton, walked in the procession as a principal person, and among those who had been sheriffs for that county. Some part of the family removed into Norfolk in the 12th or 13th century: and we believe Sir Robert John Buxton, of Shadwell Lodge, Norfolk, bart. is the representative of that branch. The Buxtons of Buxton are also, we believe, a branch of the same family ,* the late Dr. Buxton was a celebrated physician at Buxton, and his son, the present Mr. Buxton, practises as a surgeon there. BRADLEY is a village, township, constabulary and parish, seated in a valley 3 m. E. of Ash- Braidelei, bourn, in the hundred of Appletree, and archdeaconry of Derby. In 1821 this parish consisted of 62 dwelling houses, containing 63 families, and 320 inhabitants. At the present time there are 60 dwelling houses, and 323 inhabitants, who are chiefly supported by agriculture. The extent of the township is about 2800 acres of freehold land, a great part of which is of an inferior quality, divided among six proprietors. Godfrey Meynell, esq. the lord of the manor, owns 2715 acres, of which about 80 acres are woods and coppices; the Rector, glebe land, 55 acres ; Thomas Hartshorn, esq. Mr. William White, Mr. William Thorneley, and Mr. Joseph Weston. The average rental is about 30.?. per acre. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a32799- 15.. 9d. The annual amount of the rates collected for the use of the poor for the last seven years is \u00a3188. 10_. The paupers are sent to Brassington House of Industry. There is a Sunday-school, for both sexes, supported by voluntary contributions. There are no dissenting chapels, no friendly societies, and but one public-house in the parish.

In i Edward I. Ralph de Okeover held lands here. At a very early period it became the property of the ancient family of Kniveton. After the elder branch ofthe Bradley Knivetons became extinct, this manor passed to Sir Gilbert Kniveton, of Mercas ton, bart. whose father had been created a bart. in 1611, and whose ancestors had been settled at Mercaston for several generations.* Sir Gilbert removed to Bradley, his son and successor, Sir Andrew, who had suffered much in his fortune by the civil war, sold Bradley, in 1655, to Francis Meynell, esq. alderman, citizen, and goldsmith ofthe city of London, in whose family it still re mains; and Godfrey Meynell, esq. is the present proprietor and lord of the manor. The old hall at Bradley, the seat of the Knivetons, and afterwards of the Meynells, was pulled down many years ago, and stables and offices built for an intended new mansion.

The existing branches are descended lineally from Gilbert, the younger brother of Hugo, who is called the Earl of Leicester. In the time of Henry III. this family became connected with that of Ferrers, whose armorial bearings they as sumed. In the earliest state of parliamentary representation, namely, in the reign of Edward I. different members of the Meynells were^knights^in parliament for this county. Hugh de Mey nell, in the reign of Edward III. was an eminent warrior, and was present at the victories of Cressy and Poictiers. In the time of Charles I. John, the eldest son of Godfrey Meynell, of Wil lington, was slain in the service of that unfortunate prince. His three brothers became the heads of two of the branches now existing ; the eldest of whom, Francis Meynell, sheriff and alderman of London, purchased the manor of Bradley, in 1665. The Yorkshire branch ofthe Meynells may be traced to Stephen, the grandson of Gilbert, who accompanied the Conqueror from Nor mandy, and elder brother of William, from whom the two branches already mentioneJ are de rived."], [186, "160 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Bradley Ash. See Broadlow Ash. BRADSHAW EDGE, a township in the parish of Chapel-en-le-Frith. See Chapel-en-le-Frith. Bradway, in Norton parish. BRADWELL, a populous village and hamlet in the constabulary and parish of Hope, in the Bradewell, hundred of High Peak, is situate in a deep valley, surrounded by high moun- tains, 1 1 m. S. E. of Hope. _ \u00bb In 1821, this village contained 234 houses, 238 families, and 1 1 30 inhabitants ; in 1831, the families were increased to 252, and inhabitants to 1153. The chief of the inhabitants are sup ported by the mines, of which there are several good ones in the neighbourhood, belonging to the working miners. Agriculture, cotton-spinning and smelting of lead, furnish employment for about one-third ofthe families. Bradwell brook rises in the hamlet, and runs through the village in a north-eastwardly direc tion to the village of Brough, where it falls into the Nooe. The extent of the township is 2220 acres of good grazing and grass land, including 718 acres of common, which was enclosed in 1 806. The land is chiefly limestone ; the valleys are rich and fertile, but the high land is rather barren. The farms are small, and the average rental is about iOs. per acre. The tithes belong to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, and have been rated for four or five years at is. per acre. The land is divided among 93 freeholders ; the Earl of New burgh owns between 5 and 600 acres, George Hadfield, of Mottram hall, in Cheshire, esq. about 300 acres, Mr. Abraham Dakin, about 250 acres, Mr. Hall, of Castleton, has a good estate here, and Mr. Shepherdson has about 280 acres. The others are smaller proprietors. The estimated annual value of all the land and buildings is \u00a31818. 12s. 6d. The average of eight years' parochial expenses is \u00a3333. 12.. 6d. per annum. The paupers are maintained in a work-house, at an average cost of 3s. per head. The pauper children are apprenticed to trades. The young people of both sexes generally marry at the age of 18. There are two friendly so cieties, consisting of 280 members, a Sunday-school at the Wesleyan Methodist chapel, at which 300 children are taught, in a capital school-room, built by subscription, in 1.28, and the school is supported by voluntary contributions. The Wesleyan Methodists have here a large and hand some chapel, and there are three other chapels for protestant dissenters, and six public-houses in the village. The King is lord of the manor; and the Duke of Devonshire, as lessee, holds a court here half yearly. This manor was part of Peverel's lands after the Conquest. Leving had two carucates of land to be taxed when Doomsday Book was taken. An intrenchment, said to be Roman, is visible for many miles. The Bagshaw Cavern, which we have already noticed at page 17, in the first part of this work, is worthy of inspection. A correspondent observes, that were a public road to go through this place, he has no doubt it would become the most celebrated cavern in the kingdom: and that it would vie with, if not exceed, the grotto of Antiparos. About a quarter of a mile from the village there is a salt spring, -which is worthy the attention of the faculty, as we believe the water has never been analyzed. BRAILSFORD, a village, township, constabulary and parish in the archdeaconry of Derby Brailesford, an(j hundred of Appletree, is situate on the turnpike road from London to Manchester, 6 m. S. of Ashbourn, and 7 m. N. W. from Derby. This parish includes the villages of Burroughs, Culland and Ednaston, and contained, in 1821, 132 houses, 155 families, and 724 inhabitants, now increased to about 760, who are chiefly em ployed in agriculture, and trades connected therewith. Lysons says, the parochial chapelry of Osmaston is in the parish of Brailssord. The extent of the township is about 400 acres of land, of various soils, some on a fine marl substratum, and some of a gravelly and peat nature, which is not so productive : a small brook waters a few meadows. The parish of Brailssord is divided among 22 proprietors, viz. William Evans, esq. the lord of the manor, owns about 600 acres; the executors of the late John Rose"], [187, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 161 Swindell, esq. who owns about 700 acres ; the Right Hon. Earl Ferrers, lord of the manor of Ednaston hamlet, in which he owns about 660 acres ; Edward Soresby Cox, esq. lord of the manor of Culland, of which he owns about 150, and 300 acres in Brailssord; John Harrison, of Snelston hall, esq. Ednaston hall farm, 295 acres ; Miss Eliza Toplis, of Wirksworth, 295 acres ; the Rector glebe land, 60 acres; John Boden, esq. 200 acres; William Osborne, of Burrows hall, gent. 100 acres; the Rev. Joseph Sykes, of Newark, 100 acres; Mr. Thomas Haynes, 105 acres; Mr. William Haynes, 63 acres; Mr. Thomas Holmes, 125 acres; Mr. Thomas Webster, of Mercaston hall, 92 acres ; Mr. John Hulland, 80 acres ; Henry Brough, gent. 67 acres ; Mr. Bowyer, sur geon, and four other small proprietors. A few farms are from \u00a3200. to \u00a3400. per annum, and the rental of the land varies from 1 5*. to 45*. an acre. The tithes are rated by composition, the greater part is on lease, the lesser portion is rated annually. There are about 100 acres of wood and young plantations ; one-sixth of the land is arable, and the other meadow and pasture. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a36859. 0s. lOd. The averao-e of seven years' parochial expenses is, poors' rate \u00a3300. county rate and constables' account \u00a3170. highway rate \u00a370. and church rate \u00a340. together \u00a3580. per annum. The paupers are sometimes sent to Alstonfield House of Industry. The pauper children are generally apprenticed to trades. There is a parochial, and one Sunday-school, at the latter about 60 scholars attend, who are in structed free, by voluntary contributions of the inhabitants. The Wesleyan Methodists erected a chapel here in 1821. There is one bridge, repaired at the expense of the county, and three public-houses in the village. The roads have been much improved, under the direction of Mr. Mac Adam. In Brailesford, Earl Wal/ef had two carucales of land to be taxed. Land io two ploughs. There are now in the demesne two ploughs, and twenty-four villanes, and three bordars have Jive plowhs. There is a priest, and half a church, and one mill of 10.. St.. and eleven acres of meadow. Wood pasture one mile long and one mile broad. Value in king Edward's time 60s. now 40*. Elfin holds it. D. B. 305. The manor, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, belonged to Earl Walles. At the Conquest it was given to Henry de Ferrers, under whom Elfin, ancestor of the ancient family of Brailssord, held it. In 25 Edward I. Ralph de Bakepuze had this and other estates belonging to the Fer rers' family, under some agreement, to cover them after Earl Robert's attainder, which lands were held by Henry de Brailssord, who was fined in the reign of Edward I. for refusing to be made a knight. About the year 1380, Sir John Bassett, of Cheadle, married the heiress of Sir Henry de Brailssord, and became possessed of the estate. Sir Ralph Shirley, by his marriage with the heiress of Bassett, of Cheadle and Brailssord, obtained the manor : he died about the year 1 443, and left it his son, Sir Ralph, who died in 1469, and was buried at Brailssord, where the remains of his monument, with a mutilated inscription, are still to be seen ; he held it under Duke Clarence, of Tutbury. This manor remained in the possession of the noble family of Shirley until within the last half century. Earl Ferrers sold the manor and several farms to Mr. John Webster, a banker in Derby : on his becoming a bankrupt, this estate was purchased of the as signees by William Drury Lowe, of Locko, esq. and has since passed by purchase to William Evans, of Allestree hall, esq. who is the present proprietor. Over Burroughs hall and estate formerly belonged to the Bradbume family. Early in the seventeenth century it was sold to the Ferrers' family, of Tamworth, who appear to have not held it long, for the family of the present possessor, William Osborne, gent, have been proprietors of it for nearly two centuries. Culland. In 13 Henry VII. Thomas Shaw died and left this manor to his brother, Robert Shaw, a lunatic. In 11 Henry VIII. Joan, widow of Sir Ralf Shirley, died and left it to her son Francis. Some time after it came to the Drapers. In 1646, Robert (only son and heir of James Draper, of Culland) died, his son and heir Robert had only one child, who died young. He died in 1689, when this estate, consisting of 421 acres, descended to his three sisters and co-heirs (or their children) two of which married to Jason and Bate, and the other to John Rowe, of v"], [188, "162 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Windle hill, gent, whose daughter and heiress, Prudence, married George Newall, esq. who ul timately became possessed of the whole. He died in 1 740. His eldest son, Rowe Newell, in 1725, took the name and estate of Port, of Ham, by bequest from his mother's kinswoman, Catherine, sole daughter and heiress of John Port, esq. He died in 1 749, and was succeeded in this estate by his brother George, who took the name of Port. In 1769 this George died, being succeeded here by his nephew, John Sparrow, who took the name of Port, and sold Culland, in 1794, to Mr. William Cox, and it is now the property of his eldest son, Edward Soresby Cox, esq. The manor of Ednaston, which had been given to the priory of Tutbury, by Robert, Earl Ferrers, the elder, was granted, in 1540, to Sir John Gifford, who, in 1542, conveyed it to Francis Shirley, esq. ancestor ofthe present proprietor, Earl Ferrers. The ancient embattled tower church is a Norman structure ; round the string-courses of the tower are some rude sculptures, and in the chancel three stone stalls. Between the nave and the chancel is a round Saxon pillar, with an enriched capital ; behind which there appears to have been a passage to a confessionary. In the centre of the chancel there are several alabaster flags, on two of which are effigies, in scroll lines, of knights in armour ; and on a third, a priest in his vestments : the inscriptions are so effaced that only a few words of each can now be made out. Round the edge of one are these words, Gentleman and Bailiff unto the Most Worshipful baronet Shirley, and Worsh- At the foot of another, Rauf Shirley, esquire, and Dame Alice, his third wife, on whose soivles God have mercy. Lysons says, this Sir Rauf Shirley, son of Ralph who died about 1443, was buried at Brailssord in 1466. The church is dedicated to All Saints. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a39. 19_. 2d. and yearly tenths 19s. 2d. and is now worth about \u00a3600. per annum. The Right Hon.

His ancestor was Thomas Cox, of Nether Itchington, clerk of the crown in the reign of Elizabeth, whose eldest son, John, was slain in the service ofthe Venetian Republic, and his youngest, James, fell a victim to his loyalty during the wars between Charles I. and the parliament. In looking over the more modern portion of the lineage, we find William Cox, tutor to the family of the Earl Ferrers, resident at the parsonage of Brailssord; and the late William Cox, celebrated for his agricultural pursuits and improvements, was grandson to that gentleman. The sons of this emi nent agriculturist are now living in the town of Derby, and its neighbourhood, and are propri etors of extensive lead works, besides being in possession of considerable estates elsewhere. The residence of E. S. Cox, of Brailssord, esq. is delightfully situate on an elevated site, over looking a valley of great extent and beauty. Bramley, in Eckington parish. BRAMPTON is a pleasant rural village, 3 m. W. of Chesterfield; a township, constabulary Brantune, anc{ extensive parish, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Derby. The parish extends 5 m. by 3i m. and comprises the township of Cutthorpe, the villages of Ashgate, Hall-cliff, Holy-moor-side, Brampton Moor, New Brampton and Wadshelf, or Watchell, and the places of Wigley, Chander-hill, Lead-hill, Upper and Nether Loads, Somersall, Birley Grange, Broomfield, Hilltop, Frlthnall, Prat-hall, &c. and contained,, in 1821, 393 houses, 434. families and 2317 inhabitants: but it appears this return only includes a part of the parish, for the number is now much greater; in 1801, there were 2047, and in 1811, 2260 persons; the great increase which has taken place within the last few years, is attributable to the extension of manufactories now carried on in the parish. \u2014 These consist of earthenware, iron-foundries, cot- ton-wick, tape, cotton-twist, &c. making of bricks and the working of collieries. In 1831, there were 700 houses, 723 families, and 359i inhabitants. Of the 723 families, 119 were chiefly em- ployed in agriculture, 286 in trade or handicraft, 322 in the collieries and in other pursuits. Of the 815 males, above 21 years of age, 325 were employed in retail trade or handicraft, 213 miners and labourers, and 1S3 in agriculture."], [190, "164 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Brampton is divided into three divisions or districts, viz. North Lane, Church Lane and Sun Lane, each of which has a separate surveyor of the highways. Brampton is bounded on the W. by Baslow, N. N. W. by Barlow, N. E. by Newbold, E. by Chesterfield, S. S. E. by Walton, Ashover and Beeley, and watered by Linacre and Moor side brooks, and numerous other springs. Linacre wood is about 120 acres. The extent of the township is 7920 acres of ironstone and coal land, of various soils, viz. old enclosures, 4571 a. 2 r. Commons, enclosed in 1815, 3348 a. 2 r. ; the land is chiefly freehold, and is divided among about 50 proprietors. The largest proprietors are his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, Sir George Sitwell, bart. William Melland, esq. John Gorell Barnes, esq. John Dixon, esq. Miss Johnson, of Chesterfield, Messrs. Hewitt, Longson and Co., Messrs. Wright and Sons, Mr. John Wright, John Elliott, Thomas and James Shemwell, the family of Wilcock son, viz. John, Alwood, Samuel, Edward, and William and Joseph, of Leadhill and Broomfield ; the Watkinsons, &c. &c. The great tithes are leased to the Duke of Devonshire, who re-lets them to John Gorell Barnes, esq. and he charges the land-owners and occupiers about 2.. 2<_. per acre. The small tithes are collected by the Rev. W. Peach. The farms are small, the rental being from __1. to \u00a33. but the average is about 28.. per acre. The poor-rate, county-rate and constables' accounts, average about \u00a3702. per annum ; the church-rate about \u00a365. and the highways are di vided into three districts. The occupiers of land are required to do six days' statute-duty for every \u00a350. they rent, or to pay Is. in the pound above that sum. The paupers are sent to Ash over work-house, and the pauper children are apprenticed to trades. There is one friendly society at Holy-moor-side ; a Wesleyan, a Primitive Methodist and a Calvinist chapel. One Sunday-school at Pratthall, established by Mr. James Crowshaw ; one at New Brampton and one at Brampton ; these are supported by voluntary contributions ; an en dowed parochial school, and 1 5 public-houses in this parish. This village was the birth-place ofthe celebrated Dr. Linacre. In Brantune and Wadecel, Wade had three ox-gangs and a half of land and four acres lo be taxed. Land to half a plough. Walter has now in the demesne there, one plough and one vil/ane : and three bordars having half a plough, and two acres and one perch of meadow. Wood-pasture, one mile and a half long and one quarenten and a half broad ; value in king Edward's time and now 5s. id. Of that land, Walter vouches the king for his protector, and Henry de Ferrariis as the person who de livers seisin to him. In Brantune and Wadescel, Branwine had seven ox-gangs and four acres of land lo be taxed. Land to one plough. There is now in the demesne, one plough and three villanes, and one bordar have one plough. There are five acres of meadow. Wood-pasture, one mile and a half long and three quarentens broad ; value in king Edward's time and now 10s. Ascuit holds it. This manor belonged then to Ascuit Musard. D. B. 315. Two manors, after the Conquest, belonged to Ascuit Musard, and one to Walter Deincourt. At an early period, the two former became united, and were given by Henry II. to Peter de Brampton. Thomas, the son of Ralph de Brampton, took the surname of Le Caus about the year 1216. This family were lords of the manor of Caus, or Caushall manor, until the extinction of the male line, in the reign of Henry VI. or Edward IV. ; two of the co-heiresses married Ash and Baguley. Four-fifths of the manor was purchased by the Earl of Shrewsbury, in the reign of Elizabeth, and one-fifth then belonged to Ash. The family of Talbot sold it to the Earl of Newcastle. This estate was valued, in 1641, at \u00a3142. 4*. 8a\". Having passed by heiresses into the families of Holies, Harley and Bentinck, it was included in an exchange made between the late Duke of Portland and the late Duke of Devonshire, and now belongs to the present Duke of Devonshire. The manor, which belonged to the Deincourts, passed with Sutton to the Leaks, and was con veyed with it to the Clarkes ; the Clarkes of Chilcote had a seat at Somersall, or Summersall, for many generations ; another family, of the same name, resided at Ashgate, in this chapelry. Sum mersall is now a farm house, belonging to Miss Johnson, of Chesterfield, who purchased it from the Marchioness of Ormond, in 1826. Ashgate is the property of John Gorell Barnes, esq. Wigley was the original residence of the"], [191, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 165 ancient family of Wigley, of Wigwell. Linacre, formerly esteemed a subordinate manor, was the property and residence of the ancient family of Linacre. Robert Linacre, who died in 1512, was seised of Linacre hall and a manor in Brampton, held under the Earl of Shrewsbury. Birley grange belonged formerly to the monastery of Louth. The Abbot and Convent of Ruffbrd, Not tinghamshire, had lands in Brampton, which were granted by Henry VIII. to the Earl of Shrews bury. Wadshelf, Wadescel, or Watchell, which took its name from Wade, the Saxon owner, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, was given by the Musards to Beauchief abbey. These are all now parcel of the manor of Brampton. An ancient mansion and estate in Brampton belonged to the family of Bullock. James Bul lock was churchwarden of Brampton in 1658; the Jacksons inherited from the Bullocks and were succeeded by the Beresfords ; this estate, after passing into the possession of several per sons, was purchased by Mr. Dixon, of Whittington, about 1808; and the hall and estate, con sisting of about 118 acres, is now the property of John Dixon, esq. The ancient spire-church is supposed, by an inscription on one of the walls, to have existed as early as 1155. It seems to have been re-built and consecrated in the year 1253, by Brenden, Bishop of Ardfert, suffragan de Weser; Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry; but still continued dependent on the rectory of Chesterfield, which belongs to the Dean of Lincoln, the vicarage not being endowed until 1268. The Dean and the parishioners claimed a right of presentation or nomination to this chapel, which right was tried at the Derby assizes, in 1758, and the verdict was given in favour of the Dean, and a decree issued thereupon in the Chancery of the Exchequer. The church is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, whose effigies are sculptured in rough grit stone. King Henry the Second gave it, with all its appurtenances, to the Cathedral of Lincoln. The tithes, amounting to about \u00a3150. per annum, are appropriated to the Dean of Lincoln, who appoints the perpetual curate. The living has been augmented by \u00a3100. given in 1723, by Godfrey Watkinson, esq. and \u00a3100. given by Dr. Godolphin, Dean of St. Paul's, and \u00a3200. Queen Anne's bounty. There are 10 acres of glebe land, besides the small tithes, making the value of the living about \u00a3120. per annum, besides surplice fees, which in this extensive parish are considerable. The Rev. William Peach is the present incumbent. There was formerly a chantry in this chapel, founded by Hugh Ingram, who probably married one of the co-heiresses of Caus. Arms and Inscriptions in the Church. In the nave of the church Is a very curious sepulchral monument, apparently of the 13th century, which was discovered more than a century ago, on digging a grave, and is now placed upright against the wall of the nave. Within a quatrefoil, at the upper end of the stone, is the upper part of a female figure, holding a heart in her hands, sculptured in bas relief; at the other end, her feet and the lower part of her drapery appear as through an ohlong opening. On one side of the quatrefoil is a cross-floree. On the flat side of tne stone, the inscription appears to be cut in Lombardie capitals, as represented in the plate. Though the inscription is perfect, antiquarians have disagreed as to the person for whom it was designed. Lysons says, it is probable that it was for a person of no less consequence than Matilda, the heiress ofthe barony of Caus, who died in the eighth year of Henry III. Adam Wolley, esq. has put a quere to 'the accuracy of this suggestion : and observes, there was another family of the name of Caus, who were lords of the manor, or rather, of one of the manors of Brampton ; it is therefore much more probable that this lady was the wife or daughter of one of that family, than that she was allied to the Baronial family of Le Caus, of Nottingham. The inscription placed over the stone, 2b'th October, 1801, says, it perpetuates the memo ry of Matilda Le Caus, one of the family of Sir Thomas Le Caus, who, it appears by an cient records, was son of Ralph de Brampton, lord of the manor of Caushall, in this town ship, about the year 1216, in whose family it remained for more than 2.0 years. Thomas, the son of Ralph de Brampton, took the surname of Le Caus, some time about the year 1216. This family were lords of the manor of Caus, or Caushall manor, in the township of Brampton, and were resident in Brampton until the extinction of the family in the reign of Henry VI. or Edward IV. Of the family mansion of Le Caus, there is now no remains excepting a ruined barn ; the site of the building may be traced. We are therefore more inclined to Mr. Wolley's opinion than Lysons, that the lady was wife to one of the proprietors of the manor : although Dr. Thoroton says, the custody of the forests of Derby and Nottingham belonged to the Baronial family of Caus, as appears in the Forest Book, by Matilda de Caus levying a fine, 4 Henry III. for seisin of the custo marv of the forests of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, which belonged to her by right of inheritance; this Matilda was the daughter of Robert de Caus, by his wife, a daughter of Robert Basset, and might be the same Matilda recorded on the monument. From the form of the letters, the head-dress, and other external marks of the stone, the date may be ascribed to the reign of Edward I. or Edward II. ; hence it will appear, the stone is upwards of 500 years old. (The arms of Caus were per chevron, Or and Gules, three human hearts, counterchanged.)"], [192, "166 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER whom when she had brought forth her only daughter, Elizabeth, still living, she was deposited in this tomb in the 17th year of her age, on the 18th of May, 1667.

That in pri vate life, he was a man particularly worthy and amiable, was testified by his having in marriage the most accom plished Lady Catherine Stanhope, the eldest daughter of the Right Honourable the Earl of Chesterfield, a woman that exceeded all praise, with whom he lived in the in dissoluble bond of mutual affection, which could not be separated even in death. In his friendships he was con stant and faithful : in promoting the advantages of those belonging to him, he was particularly resolute and un wearied ; this the public voice testified, as well as the gratitude of those, whose bereavement, in notonedwelling alone, he alleviated.

The Rev. William Peach, curate of Brampton, offered up a short and appropriate prayer, which was followed by a pathetic address to the multitude, by the Rev. Thomas Hill, vicar of Chesterfield. The church is in the gothic style which prevailed in this county during the 1 4th century ; it consists of a nave only, 71 feet long and 46 feet wide within, and 26 feet high; there is a gallery at the west end, and a tower 70 feet high from the ground to the battlements. The walls are of stanage stone, in massive blocks ; the roof is covered with Westmoreland slate. The accommo dation is for nearly 800 persons, 400 of which are free and unappropriated. The cost of the building is only \u00a33300. a part being raised by voluntary subscription and the remainder by His Majesty's Commissioners for building churches. The architects were Messrs.

BRASSINGTON, a village, township, constabulary and parochial chapelry, in the parish of Brazinctune, Bradbourn, deanery of Ashbourn, and wapentake of Wirksworth ; it is situate in a deep valley, surrounded by limestone hills, 5\u00a3 m. N. E. of Ashbourn, 4 m. N. W. of Wirksworth, and l6m. N. N. W. from Derby. This village contained, in 1821, 148 houses, 149 families, and 689 inhabitants; now increased to about 750, who were chiefly employed in agriculture, mining, and the trades connected there with, except a few females who figure lace. The extent ofthe township is 4017 acres of good dairy land, chiefly meadow and pasture, on a limestone sub-stratum, divided among 168 proprietors; the land is principally freehold, but there is a small portion of copyhold. At the time of the enclosure, which took place in 1 803, an allot ment of 354 acres was given in lieu of tithes. Some land in this township is let for \u00a35. an acre and some for \u00a3l. : but as there is much occupied by the owners, it would be difficult to ascertain the average rental with accuracy ; it may, however, be stated at 35s. an acre. The principal proprietors are the Trustees of the late Rev. P. Storey, who own the tithe farm, 353 acres ; Philip Gell, esq. Grange Mill farm, &c. 300 acres ; William Pole Thornhill, esq. 250 acres ; Robert Dale, esq. How Grange farm, 200 acres ; William Charlton and George Gregory, gents, lords of the manor, 200 acres ; Lord Scarsdale, 120 acres ; Rev. German Buckston, 70 acres ; Air. Robert Spencer, 200 acres ; Mr. William Alsop, 1 50 acres ; Mr. Benjamin Gregory, 1 60 acres ; Mr. Joseph Watson, 150 acres; Robert Millington, gent. 100 acres; Mr. George Toplis, 60 acres; Mr. John Prestwidge, 40 acres ; Mr. William Hodgkinson, 40 acres ; Mr. James Trueman, 30 acres. The remainder is in numerous small freeholds. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a34662. 10_. The average of seven years' poor-rate, &c. is \u00a3327- Us. 8frf. per annum. The paupers are maintained in the House of Industry, which is subscribed to by several other townships. The pauper children are some times apprenticed to trades. There are but few protestant dissenters in this village, and they have no regular place of worship. There is an endowed parochial day-school ; a Sunday-school supported by the Rev. German Buckston and the inhabitants; one friendly society, consisting of about 125 members, and four victuallers in the township. There is a cave, called IJarborough hall, situate about a mile from Brassington, on the road to Wirksworth, in the lands and near to the house belonging to Mr. B. Gregory, that will contain from two to three hundred people ; and above it is a remarkable stone chair. From this eminence there is a most extensive prospect. Near the road, leading from Brassington to Pike hall, is an ancient tumuli or barrow, called Mininglow, situate on a hill, now covered with a fine plantation. Mr. Pilkington, who, in 1788, described this ancient monument, says, it is different to any he met with in the county. He found the higher part of the mound removed, and several of the vaults fully exposed to sight. The diameter was forty yards; and he supposed the vaults, carried round the circumference were about forty in number. The vault he measured was between six and seven feet long, three wide and six deep ; it consisted of only five stones, one on each side and end and the other for a cover : some a foot and some eighteen inches thick. At the time of the enclosure, a quantity of human bones were found on the moor. The town is supplied with excellent water from a never failing spring, formerly called Coole Well, now Grjfcn Well. The houses are chiefly limestone. In Brazinctune, Siward had four carucates of land to be taxed. Land to four ploughs. There are now in the demesne three ploughs, and sixteen villanes, and two bordars have six ploughs and 30 acres of meadow. Coppice- nood, three quarentens long and one broad.

In 19 Edward II. Stephen de Segrave died, and left an estate here to his son John. In 29 Edward III. Elizabeth de Montacute, widow of Thomas de Furnival, who held it of the honour of Tutbury, died seised of it ; and William, Earl of Salisbury, her son by a for mer husband, was her heir. In 32 Henry VI. John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, died seised of the manor, and left it to his son John, whose mother was eldest daughter and co-heir of Thomas Neville, who married Joan daughter and heir of William lord Furnival. In 1628, on the death of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, it passed to his three daughters, married to William, Earl of Pembroke, Henry, Earl of Kent,* and Thomas, Earl of Arundel. The Earl of Kent, in 1639, conveyed one- third ofthe manor : and in 1640, Philip, Earl of Pembroke, being possessed of his mother's and the Earl of Arundel's share, conveyed the other two-thirds, to William Savile, of Bakewell, gent, who died in 1658, leaving two sons, George, of Beeley, esq. who died S.

John Gilbert Cooper, esq. great grandson of the first named William Savile, esq. in 1749, sold the same to Henry Coape, esq. of Duffield, on the death of whose grandson, Henry Coape, esq. (son of Henry) it devolved on his cousin and heir at law, Henry Porter Sherbrooke, esq. of Oxton, co. Notts. This gentleman, in 1778, devised it to his wife, Margaret, who in 1798 devised the same to her nephew, William Sherbrooke, esq. of Oxton, who, in 1804, conveyed it to Robert Lowe, esq. of Oxton, who soon after sold the same in parcels. The King's or Duchy manor, was granted by Charles I. in 1630, to Charles Harbord, esq. and others ; who in 1632, conveyed it to Edward and George Pegge and George Lees. Soon after wards John Buxton purchased one-fourth. His son, Richard Buxton, of Brassington, gent, in June, 1640, conveyed the said fourth to William Savile, of Bakewell, gent, before mentioned, for \u00a3150.

Frances, married William Locker, esq. now of Tillington, Staffordshire, and Elizabeth, died about 1780, unmarried, intestate, in consequence of which her share descended to her two sisters, as her co-heiresses at law. After the decease of Richard Hayne, Mary Hayne, his widow (who died about 1802) devised her share of this estate to her son John for life (who died about 1808) with remainder to her son Thomas, in fee; he becoming a bankrupt, William Locker, esq. purchased his share of his assignees, having purchased in 1 8 \u2014 , from Robert Lowe, esq. Savile's moiety. Mr. Locker was thus possessed ofthe whole manor, and a considerable es tate, which he sold in 1824 to William Charlton and George Gregory, gents, who hold a court twice a year. The Gells of Hopton have had a considerable estate in this township ever since 7 Elizabeth; at which time, Ralf Gell, of Hopton, died, and left his son Anthony an estate here, which was in the possession of Sir Philip Gell, in 1712, and the same is now the property of Philip Gell. esq.

BRE.'VDSALL is a very ancient village, a township, constabulary and parish, in the hundred Ereydeshall, of Appletree and deanery of Derby. This small rural village is seated at the foot of a hill, which shelters it from the east winds, in the Derwent vale, 2^ m. N. E. from Derby. The parish is bounded on the E. by the township of Morley, on the N. by Horsley, on the N. W. by Little Eaton and Allestree, on the S. by Little Chester and Chaddesden, and on the W. by Darley. This village has the advantage of being well watered by two small rivulets, besides the Derwent and the canal, and of good roads, which pass through the township. In 1831, there were 110 houses, 125 families and 565 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in agriculture, the only manufacture being 25 framework-knitters ; a few young women and children are employed at the Darley cotton-mills. Sir George Crewe, bart. holds a court here annually. There is one windmill and one inn in the township. The extent ofthe township, including 14-61 acres of waste and common land, enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1815-16, is 2377 a. 2 r. 3ip. partly on a marl and partly on a gravel sub-stratum. At the time of the enclosure an allotment was given in lieu of tithes. The land in the vale of the Derwent is excellent, but some ofthe high land is of inferior quality; the average rental is about 30s. per acre; it is tithe-free, and the parochial expenses are not considered heavy: the poor-rate, county-rate and constables' accounts, having averaged, during the last seven years, \u00a3243. and church-rate \u00a320. per annum. The highways have of late years been heavy, this parish having three miles and three quarters of turnpike and seven miles of highways to keep in repair. The length of turnpike cost upwards of \u00a3 1800. in four years. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a32122. 2.. 9d. The township is divided between eleven proprietors, viz. Sir George Crewe, bart. the lord ofthe manor, owns about 1700 acres ; Mrs. Darwin, the Priory estate, 110 acres; the Rector, glebe land, 453 acres ; Mr. John Morley, 54 acres; Mr. Robert Walker, 39 acres ; Mr. Thomas Walker, 9 acres ; Mr. John Bailey, 7 acres ; Edward Bailey, Thomas Rowland, Josiah Shepherd and Richard Turner, are small freeholders. In Braideshale, Siward had, before the general survey, a manor, rated to the geld at Jive carucates, and the arable land wasfve carucates. 'here were, at the time ofthe Survey, in demesne, two caru- cates and twenty-one villanes : and seven bordars had eight carucates. One knight had one carucate. There was a church and a priest, and one mill of 13s. id. and twelve acres of meadow. Wood-pas ture eight furlongs in length and eight in breadth. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, and al the time of the Survey, the value was \u00a3i. ; and al the latter period, Robert held it, of the fee of Henry de Fcrrieres. This manor was given by Wolfric Spott, Earl of Mercia, to Burton abbey, in the reign of Ethel red. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, it was possessed by Siward ; and after the Conquest, by Earl Ferrers. At an early period the family of Dunne possessed it, of which family was Robertus de Dunne, who at or soon after the foundation of the Priory of Tutbury, was a con siderable benefactor thereto, as appears by the confirmation Charter of Robert, the younger Earl Ferrers, his master. This Robertus de Dunne held two knights' fees in the county of Derby, of the family of Ferrers, in the time of Henry I.; as did his son, in 12 Henry II. William de Ereydeshall is one ofthe witnesses to a Charter, without date, whereby William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, grants lands in Spondon to the church of St. Mary, in Stanley park, and is called Wil liam Du\"nne, of Breadsall, knt. in an old pedigree; but in what manner he was related to the persons ofthe same surname, before spoken of, we have not been able to discover. Robert de Duyn, by his Charter, without date, grants to Sampson de Duyn, his son, for his homage, the moiety of his manor of Breydeshall, within the village and without, in wood, in plane, in demesne"], [200, "174 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER and villanage, and with his men and villanage tenants and their sequels, and with the services and homages of freemen, in meadows, in pastures, in mills and waters and all other appurtenances without retention, except the advowson of the church of the manor, which was entirely to remain to Hugh, his son, and except the capital messuage, &c. To hold the premises so granted, to Sampson and his heirs, by his espoused wife, of Robert and his heirs, freely, quietly, peaceably, honourably, fully and entirely, in fee and inheritance for ever, by the service of half a knight's fee; and for failure of such heirs as are before described, the premises were to remain to Hugh (brother to Sampson) and his heirs. Hugh de Dunne is a witness, along with Robert le Vava sour (who was sheriff of Derbyshire in 20 Henry III.) to a Deed, without date, of Sir William Poyncond. And is also a witness with Hugh de Meynil, the said Robert Vavasour and others, to an Indenture, without date, between William le Fonn and the Abbot and Convent of Darley, and is there styled a knight. This Hugh, who probably was the eldest son of Robert, had a daughter and heiress, Johanna, who carried one moiety of this manor, in marriage, to the family of Curzon, in which family it continued, until, by an heir general, it passed to the Dethicks, the last of whom had an only daughter and heiress, married to John Harpur, a younger son of the Harpurs of Swarkestone, and on the failure of the issue of this marriage, it came, by perquisition, to the ancestor of Sir Henry Harpur, of Calke, in Derbyshire, bart. The division of the manor of Breadsall being before the passing of the statute, \" quia emptores terrarum,\" the separate parts were considered as distinct manors, and as such are constantly described in the Inquisitions post mortem respecting it. The one part being called the manor of Bredsall Over hall, and the other, the manor of Bredsall Nether hall. That part which was granted to Sampson de Duyn, called the Nether hall manor, appears afterwards to have been held by the family of Ferrers : and in 25 Edward I. on the extent of the lands and knights' fees of Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, the king's brother (then lately deceased) John de Ferrers (son of the unfortunate Earl of Derby) and Richard de Curzon, held Breydessall ofthe Earldom of Lancaster by the service of one knight's fee, at which time, the annual value of it was \u00a330. In 25 Edward III. Ralph de Bakepuze died, and held it by two knights' fees. In 4 Richard II. Henry de Chaddesden, archdeacon of Leices ter, gave some lands here to the chaplain of St. Mary, of Chaddesden, singing mass. In 50 Ed ward III. it was found that Alianore, formerly the wife of Hostelletti Tressynges, and then de ceased, had held a moiety of the manor of Breydesale, for the term of her life, of John de Ferrers, knt. (grandson of the before-named John de Ferrers) with remainder after her death to Robert, son and heir of John (the grandson) then in the king's custody, by reason of his minority, which moiety was held of John, Duke of Lancaster, as of his honour of Tutbury by knights' service. On the 14th of March, 14 Henry IV. Robert de Ferrers, knt. lord Ferrers, of Chartley, died seised ofthe manor of Breydesall, called Nether hall, held ofthe King, as of his Duchy of Lancaster, by knights' service, leaving Edmund, his son and heir, then aged 27 years and upwards. And 14 Henry VI. Edmund Feners, knt. lord Ferrers, of Chartley, died seised of it, leaving William Ferrers, his son and heir, aged 23 years and upwards. William Ferrers died without issue male, and so his estate came to his daughter, Ann, who married Devereux. Soon after this, the Nether hall manor came to the possession ofthe lords Cromwell, of Tatteshall, in Lincolnshire, in 4 Ed ward IV.* The fine was levied of Trinity term, 3 Edward IV. between Thomas Tyrrel, knt.

They released all right under the fine to Illingworth and his heirs, in the manor of Breydeshall, called the Nether hall, 400 acres of land, 508 acres of meadow, 220 acres of pasture, 2 acres of wood and l6s. rent, in Breydeshall. Richard Illingworth, the only person who appears to have taken any beneficial interest under this fine, was knight in parliament for the county of Nottingham, in the parliament held at Cambridge in the 25th, and in three several parliaments held at West minster, in the 27th, 29th and 33rd years of Henry VI. He afterwards obtained considerable preferment in the law, being appointed chief baron of the exchequer the 29th of September, 3 Edward IV. in which office he continued until the 1 1 th of the same reign, and was then a knight. He died 26th April, 16 Edward IV. seised jointly with John Fortesque and Thomas Curzon, his feoffees, of the manor of Breydeshall, called Nedyer hall, leaving Ralph Illingworth, his son and heir, aged 26 and upwards. Richard Illingworth, grandson of the Judge, left four daughters, his co-heirs, one of whom became the wife of John Dethick, of Breadsall, esq. and brought to him the manor of Breadsall Nether hall, at which time the Upper and Nether hall manors were re-united, and have ever since so continued : which John Dethick and Mary Illingworth, left their estate at Breadsall Nether hall to their son, John Dethick, esq. who died, 2 Edward VI. and left it and an estate at Chaddesden to his son George, who died, 5 and 6 Philip and Mary, and left it to his son, or brother, John, by Lama Bonnington, which John married Emma, daughter of Jasper Lowe, of Denby, by whom he had only Dorothea, who espoused Sir John Harpur, of Swarkstone : on the death of the said John Dethick, in 36 Elizabeth, the manors of Breadsall Over hall and Nether hall, passed with his heiress into the Harpur family, together with the pre sentation of the living, and they have ever since remained in the family, being now the property of Sir George Crewe, of Calke Abbey, bart. Breadsall Priory. \u2014 This was the foundation of an ancestor of the Dethicks, who placed here some Friars-Heremites, in the reign of Henry III. and afterwards converted into a small priory of Canons regular of St. Augustine, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. By an inquisition, taken on Friday next after the Feast of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary, 15 Richard the Second, on a writ of ad quod damnum, it was found, not to the damage of the King or any other, if he (the King) should enable Thomas Franceys, clerk, Henry Cotton, clerk, Thomas Wombwell and William Steynor, to give to the Prior and Canons of Breydesale park, 10 acres of land in Horestan ; nor if he should enable Franceys, Cotton and Wombwell, to give to the Prior and Canons a cottage and 8 acres of land in Chaddesden and Spondon ; nor if he should enable Robert de Kniveton, vicar of Doveridge, Thomas Wombwell, Thomas Walhouse and Thomas Wade, to give to them a cottage in Duffield, a toft and 20 acres of meadow and 10 of pasture, in Windley ; nor if he should enable Franceys, Cotton, Wombwell, Steynor and John Rosell, to give them 2 acres of land in Breydesale ; nor if he should enable John Hardy, of Morley, to give them one bovate of land in Morley; nor if he should enable Robert de Ferrariis, of Chartley, knt. to give them a toft in Breydesale ; nor if he should enable Wombwell, Walhouse, Wade and Henry Cook, to give them the reversion of an acre and a rood of copyhold land in Duffield ; nor if he should enable the before-named Henry de Cotton to give them a messuage and one acre of land, in Derby; nor if he should enable Henry Barbour, of Derby, and Edmund Townley, to give them two messuages and two cottages, in Derby ; nor if he should enable John Rosell, of Little Eaton, Cotton and Townley, to give them the reversion of a cottage in Derby, to hold to the Prior and Canons and their successors for ever, to pray for the good estate of Henry de Cotton, Robert de Ferrariis, John Hardy, Agnes, the wife of Stephen Cotiler, and Emma le Shepherd, whilst living, and for their souls, when dead ; as also for the souls of Isabel Brassyngton, Richard Cusselyng, John Taillor, of Chaddesden, Agnes, his wife, Oliver de Barton, and Maud Atte-hall, of Derby. In 3 Henry V. William Dethick gave to the said Priory, lands, S;c. in Mugginton : which Priory and all its lands was seized by Henry VIII. at the general dissolution. The Priory was valued at the dissolution at \u00a310. 17^. 9d- yearly, and was granted along with Other estates, 6 Edward VI. by the name of the manor of Breadsall park, and the site and capital"], [202, "176 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER messuage of the late Priory of Breadsall park, and the advowson of the rectory of Breadsall park (meaning the tithes of the Priory lands) to Henry, Duke of Suffolk and Thomas Duport, gent. and their heirs, to hold of the King, in capite, by the service of the 40th part of a knight's fee ; and the Duke and the co-parcener had the same year license to alien to Thomas Babington, esq. who after keeping it a short time, had license of alienation (2 and 3 Philip and Mary) to Thomas Hutchinson, gent. In 1597 we find it the property of John Leake. It was shortly afterwards purchased by Sir John Bentley, knt. counsellor at law. On his death, in 1622, it became the property of his daughter and heiress, Elizabeth, married to Sir Gervase Cutler. Mary, the daughter of Sir Gervase, married Sir Edward Moseley, bart. : after the death of Sir Edward, the son of the latter, it passed to Sir Edward Moseley, of Hulme, knt. whose daughter brought this estate to her husband, Sir John Bland, of Kippax park, Yorkshire, bart. Sir John, his son, sold it, in 1702, to Thomas Leacroft, gent, who, in 1703, sold it to Andrew Greensmith, of Wirks worth, whose great-nephew, Herbert Greenshiith, esq. (son and heir of Herbert, eldest son and heir of Robert, who was brother and heir of the said Andrew) was possessed thereof at his death, in 1788 : but being under contract for the sale of it to Mr. Samuel Beard, his uncle (who died before him) the devisees of Mr. Greensmith have since conveyed it to Mrs. Hannah Beard, widow of Mr. Beard, and Mr. Herbert Greensmith Beard, Nevill Fallows Beard, Mrs. Salmon and Miss Beard, four of his children. In the year 1799, the late Erasmus Darwin, esq. of Derby, pur chased it. Mr. Darwin died soon after his purchase, having bequeathed the Priory to his father, the well-known physician and poet, who, after his son's death, removed to Breadsall, where he spent the last years of his life, and died, April 18, 1802. Breadsall Priory stands on a pleasant elevated site, surrounded by grounds irregularly broken ; a venerable oak still remains on the estate, and conveys an idea of the ancient grandeur of the park when the monks inhabited the priory. A small rivulet which runs past the priory supplied several fish-ponds formerly. On the east side of the present mansion stood the chapel. On laying the foundations for the improvements made by the late Dr. Darwin, several stone coffins were discovered. The priory is the residence of Mrs. Darwin. The ancient church is a Norman structure, with a tower, terminated with a handsome octagon spire, dedicated to All Saints. There are three handsome stone stalls, and a compartment for the holy water in the chancel. The living is a rectory ; its clear value in the king's books is \u00a328. 2*. 8d. and yearly tenths, \u00a32. 16*. 3\\d. The present income, derived from 453 acres of glebe land, &c. is about \u00a36.50. per annum. Sir George Crewe, bart. of Calke Abbey, is the patron, and the Rev. Henry R.

Of the rare union of talents, which so eminently distinguished him as a physician, a poet and a philosopher, his writings remain a public and unfading testimony. His widow has erected this monument in memory of the zealous benevolence of his disposition, the active humanity of his conduct, and the many private virtues which adorned his character.

The School-house was built at the joint expense of Sir H. Harpur, bart. and the parishioners, in 1788, on the waste belonging to Sir Henry Harpur, lord ofthe manor. The Rev. John Clayton, rector of Breadsall, in 1745, left the sum of \u00a3200. for teaching the poor children of the said parish to read and say their catechism ; it is now increased to \u00a3346. 18_. id. which sum is vested in 3 per cent, consolidated Bank annuities, the interest of which is \u00a310. 8s. per annum. In consideration of this sum, the schoolmaster instructs sixteen boys and girls, free. Anne Johnson, of the parish of St. Sepulchre, London, hath given a close of land, known by the name of Bastead Orchard, containing 8 a. 3 r. 17 p. with the appurtenances, unto the church wardens and overseers of the poor of Breadsall ; and they are required from time to time to pay the rents, issues and profits, unto and amongst such poor widows who have been the wife of one husband, and who are of the age of sixty years. Each widow receiving the rent for one year only, and so on successively ; and in case there should be no such widow living within the said parish, it is to be distributed amongst such poor fatherless girls as shall be then living. The pre sent income is \u00a310. per annum. Anthony Walker, late of Breadsall, did by his Will, dated 15th November, 1714, give and de vise one parcel of land, called Stone Barks, lying in the liberty of Darley, leading to Matlock, in this county, unto the poor of Breadsall, for ever, to buy twelve twopenny loaves, to be distributed every Sunday throughout the year to twelve of the poorest people, such as the churchwardens and overseers should think proper ; and also directed that what spare money, remaining in the churchwarden's hands, should once in the year be distributed to sick or lame people in the said parish ; the use of it to be paid yearly. The property belonging to this charity is 14 a. 0 r. 28 p. of land, now let for \u00a324. per annum. John Bailey left in his Will \u00a320. to the poor of Breadsall ; the use of it to be paid yearly. John Walton, rector, in 1600, gave \u00a340. to the succeeding rectors, churchwardens, and most substantial men in the parish, in trust, for the best benefit and relief of the poor of Breadsall. William Keen gave \u00a330. to the poor. John Hieron, a puritan divine of some note, born at Stapenhill, where his father was vicar, was presented to this rectory, by Sir John Gell, in 1644, and continued to possess it till he was ejected for non-conformity, in 1662. After a short residence in some other parts, he removed, in 1668, to Loscoe, where he died in 1682, and was buried at Heanor. He was esteemed an able biblical critic, and abridged Pole's Synopsis, but published only one volume of Sermons, and a theological work. He appears to have meditated a Parochial History of Derbyshire, for which he made considerable collection from records, now in the possession of Godfrey Meynell, of Mey- nell Langley, esq.

Previous to that period the lineage is traced to the Dar wins of Cleatham, in Lincolnshire, who resided there during several generations in the 17th cen tury. The Cleatham branch became extinct, in the male line, by the death of William Morgan Darwin, who had issue, four daughters. Robert Darwin, the uncle of William Morgan, was a barrister at law, and settled at Elston, near Newark, Nottinghamshire : he was the father of the celebrated Dr. Erasmus Darwin. The Life of that great ornament to the literature and physiology ofthe country will be found in the Biographical portion of this work ; it will be sufficient to say, in this place, that Dr. Darwin rose rapidly to eminence at Lichfield, where he settled about the year 1756, at the age of 24, as a physician. His studies in natural philosophy were extensive, and his relaxations were poetic compositions highly enriched by fancy and the powers of diction. His astonishing work, entitled Zoonomia, which treats of the Laws of Life, will ever be read with earnest attention by those who seek for nature untrammelled by the bondage of superstition. The freedom with which it is written has deterred many from its pages, but the bold truths as serted in those pages are daily gaining ground among philosophical students. The Doctor's poetry is splendid, and his descriptions are elaborately accurate, but it is the poetry of a philoso pher, and there is a deficiency of that sensibility which ought to engage the heart and affection, as well as the mind and admiration of the reader. Still there are sublime and interesting passages which are equal to similar portions of any other author whatever. As a physician, the fame of Dr. Darwin was so great during his lifetime, that he was sought for in distant counties, and it re mains as the highest testimony of his utility. The present eminent physicians, Dr. Robert Wa ring Darwin, of Shrewsbury, and Sir Francis Sacheverell Darwin, M. D. of Sydnope, in this county, may be said to rival the medical reputation of their illustrious father. The existing mem bers of the family are numerous.

There is a school for boys, and one for girls, supported by the Earl of Chesterfield and the inhabitants. The Earl of Chesterfield is the sole proprietor. The manor belonged to Algar, Earl of Mercia, before the conquest, and was left by him to Edwin, his son, who, having fought against the Conqueror, and being slain, his estates fell into the hands of William I. and was part of the royal demesne of the crown. At an early period it became the property of the Earls of Chester, and passed with a part of the manor of Repton to the family of Segrave. In 1291 Nicholas de Segrave had a charter of free warren ; his son John was the king's lieutenant in Scotland, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Bannockburn. In 1295 he was summoned to parliament as a baron, and five years afterwards had the king's license to castellate his mansion at Bretby. The castle and manor belonged to Thomas de Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, and second son to Edward the First, from whom it descended to the Mowbrays, Lords Mowbray and Dukes of Norfolk. In the reign of Richard II. Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, died seised of the manor and castle of Bretby. It afterwards came by inheritance into the family of Berkeley. In 15 Henry VII. the second Duke of Norfolk, divided with Maurice, surviving brother of William, Marquess of Berkeley (who died without issue) the lands which fell to them by right of their descent from the co-heirs of Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. The manor of Bretby was part of the moiety which was allotted to the Marquess. Thomas, Lord Berkeley Mowbray, died possessed of it in 39 Henry VIII. In this reign Jane, granddaughter to Sir Michael Stanhope, married Henry, Lord Berkeley. In 1569 Henry, Lord Berkeley de mised the manor and castle for forty-one years to Thomas Duport ; and Lysons supposed the heiress of the latter married Mr. John Mee, who was the lessee in 1585, when the Berkeley family sold their interest in the manor and castle, and conveyed them to Edward Scarling and Lawrence Wright in trust for Sir Thomas Stanhope, for the sum of \u00a32500. In 1815, on the death of Philip, the late Earl, the manor and estate descended to George Augustus Frederick, the present Earl. We extract from the topographer, published in 1790, the following notice of Bretby : \" As we approach the side of Bretby park from Ashby, we lose much of the woody shades, that, till lately, hung around. Lord Stanhope, in his father's life time, here cut down a fine wood upon his es tate, called Newhall Springs, and the Earl of Chesterfield has since robbed his beautiful park of most of its venerable ornaments. We, however, stop to contemplate the fate of this once noble but deserted place. A large avenue from the park gate leads from this road about half a mile to the site of the house, which, when standing, was magnificent. Here stood a magnificent old mansion, which as report says, was built by the famous Inigo Jones, and probably it was by that master, from the style of architecture, which we remember to have seen when it existed, ten years ago, as well as from examining it, as still preserved in a bird's-eye view, engraved by I. Kip, in the ' Nouveau Theatre de la Grande Bretagne.' It was probably built by the family, after their house at Shelford, in the county of Nottingham, was ruined by the parliament army. \" The house consisted of a long but narrow body, with wings of about the same dimensions ; the tops of the latter were circular, but the gables on the roof of the former were more varied. The court was protected by massy iron gates, through which you passed, on a flag pavement, to a portico on the ground floor. This led to a hall and large staircase, painted and hung with many excellent paintings. The rooms were, for the most part, magnificent, with painted ceilings, rich tapestry, and noble pictures. \" Beyond, at right angles with the east wing, was an admirable chapel, finished in 1696; the architecture was Grecian, or of the Ionic order, very light and handsome. Within was a rich lining of cedar, the altar-piece, of Italian marble, was remarkably fine ; there was also an organ"], [209, "183 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. in the gallery ; and at the east end of this chapel stood a very large and venerable cedar, which is still remaining.\" Mr. Wolley, in his Manuscript History of Derbyshire (1712) speaks thus of Bretby: \"The seat of the Earl of Chesterfield is situate in the midst of a large park, well wooded, and stored with several kinds of deer, and exotic beasts ; there are several fine avenues of trees leading to the house, which is of stone, though not of the modern architecture, yet very regular, convenient, and noble, with a very curious chapel, and very good outbuildings ; but the gardens, fountains, labyrinths, groves, green-houses, grottoes, aviaries, but more especially the carpet-walks, and situations of the orange-trees and water-works* before the marble summer-house, are all noble, and particularly curious and pleasant, suitable to the genius of the owner, Philip Stanhope, the third Earl of Chesterfield, who has also been the chief contriver of them, who now, about 80 years of age, retains a great deal of that vigour and capacity which has hitherto rendered him the glory of the nation. The gardens were disposed after the plan of Versailles, in the old grand style, with terraces, leaden images in the shape of wild beasts, fountains, &c. \" The park, though not very extensive, was formed by nature, with much variety to please ; a deep glen divided the eastern side, down which winded a chain offish-pools; the swells on every side were clothed with fine timber, until the American war caused them to be felled. In the other parts, long avenues of elms and chestnuts filled the scene. To the north-east, Repton shrubs, that glorious wood, which still retains its greatness, seemed a continuance of the same park, and highly ennobled the scenery. A little west of the north rises that charming feature, called Bretby Mount, an object seen from most parts of the county. Such is the mutilating power of a few years, that where we before wandered amidst the finest shades, trees are now but thinly scattered ; and where we might behold a magnificent edifice, adorned with noble paintings and all the richest ornaments of the times, now scarcely a relic is discovered ; the materials being all sold, and only a small house erected for the steward. This, however, was the celebrated scene of the Count de Grammont's visits to the beautiful Countess of Chesterfield, in the time of Charles II.\" The late Earl of Chesterfield was persuaded, in his youth, by an artful steward, to pull down this splendid old mansion and chapel, as being in a dangerous state of decay, though it was after wards proved to have been very substantial. Its demolition, which took place in 1780, was sin cerely regretted by the late Lord, who was ever after much attached to the place, and for some time inhabited a small house, erected by the steward out of the materials of the old house, until he built the present splendid mansion. The castle, according to tradition, was standing in the reign of Elizabeth ; the site is still dis cernible near the church. The chapel, with the tithes of the chapelry, were parcel of the rectory of Repton, which be longed to the priory at that place. This grant was confirmed by John, archbishop of Canterbury, 13 Kal. April, 1279- It passed with one of the co-heiresses of Sir John Port, to the family of Hastings, and probably was brought into the Stanhope family by the marriage of the first Earl of Chesterfield with a daughter of Francis, Lord Hastings. The living is a donative, in the gift of the Earl of Chesterfield, and the Rev. John Chamberlayne is the present incumbent, and chaplain to the Earl. The late Earl and Countess of Chesterfield supported a school for thirty boys, and another for thirty girls, in which the children were clothed and instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic. These schools are still kept up, and are chiefly supported by the Earl of Chesterfield. * The water-works were began to be constructed in 1084, and finished in 1702, most probably by the same artist, who constructed those at Chatsworth. They consisted of numerous jets-d'eau, one cf which, from a dragon's mouth, was thrown to the height of fifty feet. On the east side of the house was an oblong piece of water ; in the centre of which was a lofty pedestal, supporting a statue of Perseus ; from the sides ofthe pedestal issued numerous jets-d'eau. The orangery was very extensive, its large and lofty trees all growing in the natural soil, the conservatory having a lofty roof, and sides of glass removable in the summer. These gardens appear to have been preserved complete, with the water-works, &c. until 1780, when they were destroyed with the house."], [210, "184 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The following Masque, written by Sir Aston Cokayne, was presented here on the twelfth night, 1639- THE PROLOGUE. To be spoken by whom the Masquers shall appoint. To you, great Lord, and you, most excellent lady, And all this well-met, welcome company, Thus low I bow : and thank that you will grace Our rude solemnities with such a presence. The Lar familiaris ofthe house being proud of so much and great company, and glad of their free and noble entertainment, appears to congratulate the hospitality of the lord and lady, and speaks these lines. Better than I could wish ! Superlative To all relations, not examples now I I've known the household Gods of Rome and Greece, And all the good Penates of famed Troy, Heard what they could triumph in, of their fates ; Tell jovial stories of the frolic Greek, And the great banquets of fam'd Ilion ; Have been inform'd of Egypt's glorious feasts To entertain the courtly Anthony : Yet was there or necessity or pride, Or empty prodigality in all. Here is a course steer'd even and voluntary ; And I rejoice, as much as Ganymed, Olympus Nectar, and __m.ro_i\u00ab-keeper. Here I grow fat with plenty of all sorts That either seas, or land, or air can yield ; And here I live, as well admir'd as envi'd By all the Lares of all other places, For there's a constancie in my delights, A blest Elyzium, where I do not want The tythe of any wish I ever thought. The proudest Lares of the greatest princes, May boast of state and languish in a noise, Whilst here I live secure, and do enjoy As much of every thing, but fears and dangers. And may it last while fate attends on time, Until the supreme deities of heaven Think you too worthy to adorn the earth, And mean to fix you glorious stars in heaven : And while there's air but to receive a sound, May your names busie it to speak your praise. Continue ever matchless, as you are A pair without compare, and but a pair. A Satyre, invited by the loudness of the music, and the perpetual concourse of people, to in form himself to what end all tended, comes boldly in, and meets the Lar familiaris. Lar. What means this bold intrusion ? Sat. Friend, forbear ; The plenteous autumn does enriche our banquets With earth's most curious fruits, and they un- bought ; The healthful winter doth not pain our bones, For we are armed for cold, and heat in nature. We have no unkind loves in meads or fields, That scorn our tears, or slight our amorous sighes. Nor are we frantick with fond jealousie, The greatest curse Jove could inflict on's queen, For all her curious search into his life : We in the woods esteem that beast the stateliest That hath his head the richliest spread with horns. The golden age remains with us, so fam'd By your Athenian and Roman poets. Thus we enjoy what all you strive to get, With all the boundless riches of your wit. Lar. Satyre ! when I but say th' art ignorant, My flourishing boast is answered at the full. Sat. But I desire a larger way. Lar . And take it. Tho' I was born i' th' woods, and rudely bred Among the salvages, I have a mind Aspires the knowledge of great princes courts, And to what end aimes all this jollity In yours as well as others palaces. Lar. Dost thou approach to censure our delights, And nip them in the bud ? Satyre, take heed, We'll hunt you hence through all the woods and launs, And over all the brooks thine eyes have seen. Sat. You threaten more perhaps than you can do : What art ? Lar. I am this Palace Deity. Sat. I wish thou wert a servant unto Pan, Or any God that doth frequent the fields. Lar. So would not I, I'm better as I am. Sat. Thy ignorance bewitches thee to this : Thou liv'st among all fears, all noise, all care, While I walk merry under heaven's bright eyes. We in the fields are free from any sin Against th' almighty deities of heaven : We know no law but nature's ; do not tremble At princes frowns ; have neither fear nor hope ; And are content ; a state the Gods exceed not. You languish in a perpetuity Of thoughts, as unconfin'd as are your ends; Y'ou truly lavish all your faculties In getting covetous wealth, which we contemn. Your sleeps are starting, full of dreams and fears ; And ours as quiet as the barks in calms. The youthful spring makes us our beds of flowers, And heaven-bright summer washeth us in springs, As clear as any of your mistress's eyes : Canst thou compare the rags of nakedness Before the studied dressings of these times ? And canst thou like a cold and stony cave Before the perfum'd beds of palaces ? Admire the melancholy falls of waters Or whistling musick of th' inconstant windes, The chirping discord of the wanton birds, Above the angel-voices of our ladies, And th' exquisite variety of musick, Order'd to thousand several instruments ? Content to cloy thy homely appetite With crabs and slows, and nuts, and rude mixt herbs, Before the stately banquets of the great ?"], [211, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 185 How canst thou like beasts inarticulate voices Above the heav'n-given eloquence of men ? Forsake the woods (fond Satyre) and but try The unthought difference 'twixt them and us. The hills are fit for beasts ; converse with men, And thou wilt never like thy cause again. Sat. Thou almost do'st perswade me : but then I Shall leave mine old, and honest company. Lar. Thy new ones shall exceed them. Here's a butler Will give thee wine as rich as is thy blood. And here's a cook will clothe thy bones with flesh, As rich as was young Jason's golden fleece. Sat. Well : I will live with thee. Lar. And welcome, Satyre. Sat. Spite of the fates, and Grecia's best protector, I'll be Achilles, and o'ercome thy Hector. Lar. A resolution worthy thy Sy/vanus. Sat. But for my last farewell unto the woods I'll shew you a wild dance of nimble Satyres \u2022 For we do dance as much as they that live In princes courts, and tissue palaces. First Song, Y'ou Satyres that in woods Have frozen up your bloods, Advance yourselves and shew What great Pan's men can do ; Appear. Here you had need beware, And move as swift as air : These are not sylvan swains, But courtly lords and dames. Sit here. THE ANTI-MASQUE. Satyres, rudely, but decently attired, stuck with flowers, and bay's-chaplets on their heads, come in, and dance as many several antics, and in as many several shapes, as shall be necessary. Being ready to depart, two excellent youths, in rich apparel, come striving in together ; to whom the Lar speaks. Lar. What do you mean (sweet boys) to interrupt Our sports ? I pray you leave your wrestling thus, And do not strike your skins, too soft for blows. 1st boy. He would outrun me, and be kist before me. 2nd boy. And he leave me among these dreadful Satyres. Lar. Whence come you ? 1st and We both were left i'th' woods, and tempted by 2nd boy. Such things as these to live abroad with them. Lar. What would you have ? 1st boy. I would go to my father. 2nd boy. And I unto my mother. Lar. Who is your father ? 1st boy. The ever honour'd Earl of Chesterfield ; Worthy of all his titles by his vertues ; And full of noble thoughts. A great main- tainer Of our great-grand-father's vertue, hospitality : The feeder of the poor ; whose gate's so open, It doth not need the office of a Porter : Whose house is now Delphian Apollo's seat : For he's the patron of all arts and wit. Lar. And who is your mother, pretty one ? 2nd boy. She is the Countess to that noble lord ; A lady worthy more than earth can give her ; Rich in those vertues make her sex admir'd ; A fair exceeder of the best examples That Greek or Roman stories e'er produced : Goddess of Tame, of Anchor and of Trent. She's such an one as hath none equal to her, And therefore you may very easily know her. Lar. I know them both, and honour'd in my know- ledge : Sweet youth ! yon'd is your father, kisshishand: And that (fair little one) th' unequal'd lady Y'ou asked for : go, and beg a kiss of her. Here the Lord of the house gives his hand to his son, and the Countess kisses her son. Then the Satyre speaks to his companions. Sat. Fellows, since you have done, farewell ; I'll leave you And all the rural pastimes of the woods : I like this noble company so well, That I hereafter here intend to dwell. The Anti-masquers depart ; then the Lar familiaris speaks to the Satyre. Lar. Now (Satyre) I will let thee see how far The palace-pleasures do exceed the woods. The Lar leads the Satyre to a curious bower, all deckt with the best and finest flowers of the season : and opens a wide entry into it, where sitting upon pleasant banks, full of the sweetest herbs and delicatest flowers, he discovers the Masquers : then presently invites them forth with this song.

It is unfit we should be dumbe When beauties like to those of heaven To grace our mirths are hither come, And help to make our pleasures even. Then let us dance, and let us sing, Till hills and dales with echoes ring.

Now it is fit our souls should know No thought but what is full of pleasure Here the grand Masquers come forth, the ladyes drest like the ancient goddesses : then the Lar speaks to the Satyre. Lar.

Come, ladyes, rise, and let us know Now you have seen, what you can do ; Hark how the musick doth invite All you to solemnize this night : Then let the sounds that you do hear Order your feet unto your ear.

MARTIN, Architect and Builder, Sept. 1828."], [214, "188 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Bretby house, the principal seat of the Earl of Chesterfield, is a noble modern, castellated gothic mansion, embattled, surrounding a spacious quadrangular court, which had been several years building prior to the death of the late Earl, in 1815, since which time the building has not been continued. This mansion, at present unfinished, was designed by Sir Jeoffrey Wyatville and Mr. Martin, the Earl's architect, and built under the direction of the latter gentleman. The site is an elevation in the centre of a beautiful deer park, enriched with plantations and shady groves of chestnut, beech and other ornamental timber, together with a variety of picturesque scenery, unequalled for its extent. A small trout stream rises in the Pistern hills, and meanders through a deep glen ; this, in its course, supplies several fish ponds. The portion of the house which is finished comprises the principal suite of rooms ; these are most elegantly fitted up, and splendidly furnished agreeable to modern taste. The dimensions of the rooms, and particulars given with the accompanying plan, will convey a correct idea of the magnitude and conveniences attached to this noble structure. The saloon, which is circular, is elegantly fitted up with blue silk tabaret arid festooned dra pery ofthe same, trimmed with white silk or silver fringe. The room is lighted by three win dows ; in the pannels between the windows are two large mirrors. The ceiling, divided into compartments, is richly ornamented ; from the centre is suspended an elegant chandelier. The chimney-pieces are of statuary marble, by Westmacott. The doors, very large and massive, are of mahogany, highly polished. The circular Ottoman in the centre of the room, the couches and the chairs are covered with blue silk tabaret, to correspond with the drapery. The tables and chairs are of rose wood. The bed rooms are superior to most other houses in the county. The staircases and spacious passages communicating with them and the lower rooms give it a decided character, and reflects considerable credit on the talent of the architects in the domestic arrangement and comfort of the whole. There are a great number of excellent paintings, by ancient masters, but which have not been appropriated to their proper situations, and of which there does not appear to be any correct list. The extensive gardens are on the north side of the mansion. On the east side of the house is preserved a fine cedar of Lebanon, which probably is the oldest tree of the kind in the king dom. It was planted in February, 1676-7, as appears by the gardener's bill, still in the posses sion of the Earl of Chesterfield. According to Evelyn, the cedar had not been introduced into this country in 1664. The Enfield cedar was planted about the same time as that at Bretby; those in the physic gardens at Chelsea, in 1683. The Bretby cedar is 13 feet 9 inches in cir cumference. This illustrious family, which at the present time enjoys three seats in the House of Lords, and one baronetage, is said to derive its name from the town of Stanhope, in the county of Dur ham. In the reign of Henry III. Sir Richard de Stanhope had an estate in the north; and his son, of the same name, was lord of Estwyche, in Northumberland, and mayor of Newcastle. He obtained a grant of a third part of the town and fishery of Paxton, in Scotland, from Edward III. on account of his services against the Scots. Sir John Stanhope, the son of the lord of Est wyche, acquired the manor and mansion of Rampton, in Nottinghamshire, by marriage with the heiress of Stephen Maluvel, who was likewise, by her grandmother, heiress to the estates of Sir John de Longvilliers. This elder branch of the Stanhopes resided for several generations at Rampton ; and during the wars of the Roses, they took part with the House of Lancaster. Sir Edward Stanhope was an eminent commander, in the re,ign of Henry VII. and one of the prin cipal who vanquished John, Earl of Lincoln, at the battle of Stoke, near Newark, which was fought in behalf of the impostor, Lambert Simnel; and also against lord Audley, in 1497, when the Cornish rebels were defeated at Blackheath : where, for his valour, he was knighted in the field. He was knight of the body to the King, steward of Wakefield, and sheriff of Nottingham shire and Derbyshire, and died in 1511. The granddaughter of Sir Edward, by his eldest son Richard, was Sanchia, the sole heiress of the elder branch of the family. She married John Babington, esq. and the manor of Rampton has remained in that family and the Eyres ever since."], [215, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 189 \u2014 The second son of Sir Edward was Sir Michael Stanhope, who, during the reign of Henry VIII. obtained a grant of the manor of Shelford,* which was parcel ofthe monastery dissolved there : he obtained also the advowson of several churches and estates in no less than twenty parishes. In the reign of Edward VI. he was appointed chief gentleman of the bed-chamber. The Duke of Somerset, protector of the realm, had married his half-sister, Anna, the daughter of Sir Edward, by Elizabeth, daughter of Fulke Bouchier, lord Fitzwarren; and Sir Michael was committed prisoner to the tower with the Duke, and afterwards participated in the conten tions of that period, until in 1552 he was beheaded on Tower hill, on the same day with Sir Thomas Arundel. \u2014 From Sir Thomas Stanhope, the eldest son of Sir Michael, the Earls of Ches terfield have derived their descent. \u2014 Sir Philip, who was the grandson of Sir Thomas, was cre ated Baron Stanhope, of Shelford, in l6l6, and in 1628 he was by Charles I. created Earl of Chesterfield. When the civil war broke out between the King and the Parliament, the Earl gar risoned his house at Bretby, which was stormed and taken by Sir John Gell, at the head of four hundred musketeers. During these wars, two of the sons of the Earl perished in the Royal cause.t In March, 1643, the noble Earl himself was taken prisoner, and died in prison, after a confinement of thirteen years, in the 72nd year of his age.j \u2014 Philip, the second Earl, was the grandson of the first : he was instrumental in bringing about the restoration, and was made cham berlain to the queen of Charles II. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son. The celebrated Earl of Chesterfield (Philip Dormer) was the eldest son of the third Earl. His lordship was ambassador from this court to Holland on various occasions, and was regarded as an intelligent statesman. As lord-lieutenant of Ireland, his conduct was estimable and concilia tory. His lordship was also principal secretary of state in 1748. As a wit as well as a politician, this talented nobleman was much admired ; and his letters to his natural son, however objection able they may be in some points, display the man of the world and the elegant writer. The fourth Earl having died without legitimate issue, the titles and estates fell into the pos session of a younger branch, who are descended from Arthur Stanhope, of Mansfield Woodhouse, in the county of Nottingham, the eleventh son ofthe first Earl of Chesterfield. \u2014 Philip Stanhope, the great-great-grandson of Arthur Stanhope, was the fifth Earl. His lordship was greatly dis tinguished by his attention to agricultural improvement. He died in 1815, leaving an only son, George Augustus Frederick, the present and sixth Earl, then ten years of age. This spirited young nobleman stood high in the esteem of the late Monarch, who appointed him one of his chamberlains, and promises well to maintain the honour and dignity of his illustrious ancestors. The family estates consist of about 10,000 acres in Nottinghamshire, 6,200 in Buckinghamshire, and 6,350 in Derbyshire. To his lordship the author is indebted for much condescension, and for the donation of the accompanying plate of Bretby house. \" Henry the Eighth, by letters patent, 29th of his reign, granted the monastery of Shelford, with 25. acres of land, the advowsons of several churches, and all other appurtenances to the same belonging, to Michael Stanhope, esq. and Anne, his wife, and the heirs male of Michael. This grant was enlarged by a subsequent one in 31 Henry VIII. whereby the manor of Shelford, the advowsons of several other churches in the counties of Nottingham, Lincoln and Derby, and estates in no less than twenty parishes are added to the former. Many of these still remain in the de scendants of the first grantee, since that time ennobled by the earldom of Chesterfield. f The Priory had been converted into a dwelling-house, and continued to be the residence of some part of the Stanhope family until the reign of Charles I. During the troubles of those times, it was made a garrison for the King, under the command of Philip, son of the then Earl of Chesterfield, who lost his own and the lives of many of his soldiers in the defence of it. The Parliamentarians took it by storm, October 27, 1045, and burnt the greatest part of it to the ground. Out of its ruins a pretty large house was built in the year 1078, which still remains, but presents nothing to arrest attention or gratify curiosity. It is supposed, that after the destruction of Shelford manor, the head of this distinguished family settled in Derbyshire, and built the noble mansion described in the text at Bretby ; which mansion, through the artifice of a steward, in the early life of the late Earl, was in the year 1/80 to tally destroyed. %From a manuscript volume, in the collection of Godfrey Meynell, of Meynell Langley, esq.

The eldest son of the late Earl Berkeley, long known by the name of Colonel Berkeley, was in the gazette of September 7, 1831, as Baron Segrave, one ofthe coronation peers. Bretton, in Eyam parish. Briglitgate, in Bonsall parish. Bridgetown, in Darley and Ashover parishes. BRIMINGTON, a village, township, constabulary, and parochial chapelry in the parish and BrimintorT' deanery of Chesterfield and hundred of Scarsdale. This village is pleasant- ly seated on a hill about 2 m. N. E. from Chesterfield, on the Worksop road. In 1821, there were 127 houses, 130 families, and 629 persons. In 1831, the population con sisted of 152 families, occupying 142 houses and 759 inhabitants. Of the families, 26 were em ployed in agriculture, 33 in trade or handicraft, and 93 in the collieries and variously. The township consists of 1 148 a. 1 r. of old enclosed, and about 100 acres of unenclosed, iron- stone and coal land, chiefly of a cold clay, at an average rental of 30s. par acre. The great tithes belong to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln, who has leased them to the Duke of Devonshire. His Grace receives about is. an acre. The land is divided among 51 proprietors, the principal of whom are Sir William Chambers Bagshaw, who owns about 60 acres ; Peter Pegge Burnell esq. 200 acres; John Meynell, esq. the Tapton Grove estate, in right of his mother, the daughter of Avery Jebb, esq. 120 acres; D'Ewes Coke, esq. who owns the ancient hall, 100 acres ; Messrs. John and Anthony Heywood, 320 acres ; Robert Barker, 40 acres ; John and James Greaves, 36 acres; John Lingard, 50 acres ; Michael Scales, of London, 14 acres; Wil- liam Barker, of London, 20 acres; W. B- Thomas, esq. 6 acres; and the remainder (except the 100 acres of unenclosed) is divided among the other proprietors. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a32373. 1 Is. The average of ten years' poor rate is \u00a3 1 5 1 . a year ; in- cluding the county, church and highway rates, taking an average of 14 years, \u00a3264. per annum. In the years 182si and 1827, the church rates were \u00a377- 18.. 9|rf. each year. The manor was a berewick to Newbold when the Doomsday Book was compiled. Geoffrey son of William de Brimington, gave, granted and confirmed to Peter, son of Hugh de Brim- ington, one toft, with the buildings, and 3 acres of land in die fields there, with twenty pence yearly rent, which he used to receive of Thomas, son of Gilbert de Bosco, with the hostuages and services, reliefs and escheats, rendering yearly to him and his heirs a pair of white gloves, of the price of a halfpenny, at Christmas, for all services. The manor passed successively into the fami- lies of Breton, Laudham, and Foljambe. In 1800, Mr. Foljambe, deputy clerk of the peace for the West Riding of York, sold it to John Dutton, of Chesterfield, esq. the present owner. The church is a handsome, plain, modern structure, rebuilt in 1 SOS ; the tower had been built in 1 796, at the expense of Avery Jebb, esq. The living is a curacy, valued in the king's books at \u00a310. It has been twice augmented, by lot, in 1735, \u00a3200. and in 1753, \u00a3200. by royal bounty \u00a3400. and by subscription, in 1 762, when the sum of \u00a3500. including queen Anne's bounty, was laid out in the purchase of an estate in Ashover; and by a parliamentary grant of \u00a31200.

BROADLOW, or BRADLEY ASH, a village in the township of Thorpe, consisting of two Bradelawe, farm houses, and 405 acres of land, in the parishes of Asbourn and Thorpe, 3 m. N. of Ashbourn, and was part ofthe king's lands at the time of Doomsday Survey. The manor was parcel of the duchy of Lancaster, and was held by the Cokayne family. In 37 Henry VIII. George Beresford held lands here. In 1608, it was granted, with other estates, to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, in exchange for lands in Hertfordshire. In 1613, the Earl sold it to Dame Judith Corbet, widow of William Boothby, citizen of London, by whose bequest it passed to her grandson, Sir William, who was created a baronet in 1660. On the death of his son, Sir Henry, the second baronet, without male issue, the estate passed, in 1727, to Thomas Boothby, of Tooley Park, Leicestershire, cousin and heir of Sir Henry. For several generations this was the chief seat of the Boothby family, who had here a good old stone house and a fine park walled about. In 1754, the Boothby family sold this estate to Nicholas Twigge, esq. and two other persons ; soon afterwards Mr. Twigge became the sole proprietor, from whom it descended to his grandson, the Rev. Thomas Francis Twigge, late of Derby, who devised it to Francis Thornhaugh Foljambe, esq. youngest son of John Savile Foljambe, of Aldwark, co. York, and Osbiston, co.

BROUGH and SHATTON, two small villages forming one hamlet, in the parish and con- Scetune, stabulary of Hope, and hundred of High Peak. In 1831, con- tained 1 8 houses, 1 8 families, and 78 inhabitants, who were chiefly employed in agriculture, and at the cotton mills of Messrs. Pearson and Co. Brought is situate 1 m. E. from Hope, on the banks of the river Nooe. We have already no ticed this village as being formerly a Roman station. A gold coin of Augustus C\u00e6sar was found here about 30 years ago, in the Halsteads, by Mr. Samuel Sidebottom. The camp was at the place called the Castle, near the junction of two small streams, named the Nooe and the Brad well. According to tradition, William Peverel had a house at Brough ; and that a bloody battle was fought near Winhill and Losehill, by two armies which encamped thereon, but when, or by whom, is not known. It does not appear on examination that there have been any fortifications on them more than some ditches $. and whether these were used for fences or a slight temporary defence, is not known. About the year 1778, on removing a heap of stones to the eastward of Winhill pike, an urn, made of clay, badly baked and of rude workmanship, was found under them. The urn stood on the surface of the ground, the top covered with a flat stone, and over it the heap of stones was rudely piled up in the form of a hay-cock. Brough and Shatton hamlet contains 458 a. 2 r. 22/). of old enclosed, and about 522 a. 3 r. 21 p. of unenclosed gritstone land. The enclosed land is rather flat, and the soil is fertile ; the river Nooe runs down the north side of it ; the farirjs are small ; the average rental is about 35s. per acre ; the tithe belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield ; hay is rated at 4.. 6d. per acre. The average poor and county rate, and constables' accounts is \u00a366. 19s. 4d. per annum. The highways and church rate are collected separately. The estimated annual value of all the build ings and land, including Offerton,* is \u00a31046. 16'.. 10a*. The principal proprietors are, the Earl of Newburgh ; Robert Newton Shaw, esq. ; Robert Needham, esq.; Messrs. Thomas Bagshaw, of Shatton; Robert Middleton, of Brough ; John Middleton, of Manchester ; Benjamin Pearson and Co. ; Joseph Taylor, of Barmoor Clough; William Cockayne, of Sheffield; Christopher Greaves, of Eccles ; George Robinson, &c. The Duke of Devonshire, who, as lessee under the crown, holds a court annually at Highlow. There is one water corn-mill, two cotton-mills, one county bridge, and one public-house in the hamlet. Brough mill belonged to the family of Strelley in the reign of Edward III. who held it by the service of attending the king on horseback whenever he should come into Derbyshire, carrying a heronor (or heron falcon) ; if his horse should die in the journey, the king was to buy him another, and to provide two robes and bouche of court. BROUGHTON, CHURCH, a village, township, constabulary and parish, in the hundred of Broctune, Appletree, and deanery of Castillar, is situate about 1 m. S. of Barton Park, and 10 m. N. W. from Derby. The parish includes the village of Sapperton, situate 1 m. W. and contained, in 1831, 121 houses, 122 families, and 521 inhabitants. Of the families, 91 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 14 in trade or handicraft, and 17 variously. The extent of the township is about 2000 acres of good land on a red marl substratum, chiefly meadow and pasture, about one-sixth arable : the farms are large, at an average rental of 30s. per acre. The tithes are fixed by a modus for one half of the parish at 9d. or lOd. per acre. The average of seven years' parochial expenses, including church rate, highways, salaries, &c. is \u00a3J36l. 12*. 3d.

In 1552, Edward VI. granted it to Sir William Cavendish, and it is now the property of his de scendant, the Duke of Devonshire. The manor of Sapperton was part of Ferrers' land. In 9 Richard II. it belonged to Sir Walter Blount, in which family, the lords Mountjoy, of Barton Park, it long continued. In 9 Henry VIII. John Sapperton died and left Hellen, his daughter and heiress, an estate at Mackley, Sap perton, Scropton, Foston, and Sapperton Lees. In 7 Elizabeth, Clement Agard, of Foston, esq. left this manor and Scropton to his son William, in which family it continued until the year 1675, when Charles and John Agard, esqrs. the last of the male line, sold the demesne of the manor and the ancient hall to Adam Wolley, of London, merchant,* a branch of the family of Wolley, of Marston on Dove, who left it to his son Adam, whose daughter and heiress brought it to Thomas Yates, esq. ancestor of Henry Yates, esq. who now resides at the hall ; but the estate was sold some years ago. The late Edmund Evans, esq. purchased the estate and manor, and it is now, through his daughter and heiress, the property of John Harrison, of Snelston hall, esq. The church, dedicated to St. Michael, is a handsome structure with a square tower terminated by a low spire. In the chancel are three stone stalls, and a compartment for the holy water.

N. of Ripley, and 2 m. S. of Alfreton, has long been celebrated for its extensive iron works, established here nearly half a century ago, by Outram and Co. The works are now carried on under the firm of Messrs. Jessop and Co. who employ in their various works nearly 1500 men, and twenty-six steam engines, with a power of 700 horses. We have noticed these works at page 200, in the First Part, under our Chapter on Commerce, therefore it is only necessary to say here, that castings of any required weight, such as iron bridges, steam engines, pipes, &c. are furnished from this establishment. The manor belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Darley, who had two parks in the parish of Pentrich, viz. one at Butterley, and one at Hartshay, in the reign of Edward I. Butterley park belono-ed to the same families as Codnor, viz. Bardolf, Grey, Zouch, &c. ; a place famous for a good coal delph, and belonged to Baptist Trott, esq. early in the 18th century. The site of one of the parks, though long since disparked, retains the name. The manor was granted to Sir William Cavendish, and has passed with that of Pentrich. The family of Home had, for some descents, an estate, with a park and a capital mansion, call ed Butterley hall, where they resided. William Home, esq. died, in 1747, at the age, as it is said, of 102. His eldest son, William Andrew Home, esq. was, in the year 1759, at the age of 74, executed at Nottingham, for the murder of an illegitimate child, in the year 1724, by exposing it under an hay-stack, at Annesley, in Nottinghamshire. Charles Home, his brother, who was the principal evidence against him, survived until the year 1784, when he died at an advanced age; being the last of the family. Edward Thomas Warren, esq. his sister's son, took the name and arms of Home, by sign manual, the same year, in pursuance of the will of Captain Edmund Home, of the royal navy (brother of the above Charles) who died in 1764. He inherited the Butterley estate, which he sold about the year 1 790, to Francis Beresford and Benjamin Outram, esqrs. The present owners of Butterley hall and an estate of about 200 acres, are James Outram, a lieutenant in the Bengal service, and John Beresford, of Compton, county of Derby, esqrs.

BUXTON, a celebrated watering place, is situate near the N. W. extremity of the county, in Bawkestanes, a deep hollow or valley on the banks of the romantic river Wye ; long. 1\u00b0 50' W. ; lat. 53\u00b0 5' N. ; 34 m. N. N. W. from Derby, by way of Ashbourn ; 38 m. by way of Belper, Cromford, Matlock and Bakewell (by the new road which passes along the banks of the river Derwent, through a valley of great picturesque beauty, considered by most travellers one of the finest drives in England) 25 m. S. from Manchester, 6 m. S. W. from Chapel-en-le-Frith, 7 m. N. W. from Tides well, 12 m. N. W. from Bakewell, 21 m. N. from Ashbotirn, 24 m. W. from Chesterfield, and 160 m. N. N. W. from London. It is a market-town, township and parochial chapelry, partly in the parish of Hope, but principally in the parish of Bakewell, in the constabu lary of Chelmorton and hundred of High Peak. In 1821, the number of houses, which are chiefly built of stone and washed over, were 1S4, occupied by 188 families and 1036 inhabitants. Of the 188 families, 115 were returned as being engaged in agricultural pursuits, 57 in trade and handicraft, and 16 professionally, &c. The principal dependence of the inhabitants is more upon the crowds who assemble here du ring the bathing season than on any regular employment. It is computed that the public and private lodging-houses will accommodate from twelve to fifteen hundred persons at one time, be sides the resident inhabitants. Several shops for the manufacture and sale of fluor spar and mar ble ornaments are established in the town, and the elegant repository of Mr. Hall, for these articles, and that of Messrs. Bright and Sons, for hardware and jewellery, attracts the visitors. The diamonds procured in the neighbourhood may be seen here in great variety. They are made up in handsome ornaments, such as rings, brooches, and various articles of jewellery. There is a weekly market, on Saturday, for corn and provisions ; and four fairs during the year, held on February 3rd, April 1st, May 2nd, and September 8th, for sheep, cattle, horses and pedlery, obtained by grant in 1813. The township of Buxton is bounded by Chelmorton on the south, Hartington Upper Quarter and Fairfield west, and Fairfield to Topley Pike, in Taddington, south-east. The Wye divides the townships of Buxton and Fairfield, and part of the offices belonging to the crescent stands in the latter. The township includes Cowdale, King's Sterndale, and Staden, and consists of 748 a. 3 r. 28 p. of old enclosed, and 977 a. 3 r. 25 p. of new enclosed land; the enclosure, under an Act of Par liament, was completed in 1774. The land is limestone, and principally meadow and pasture. The tithes of hay, corn, wool and lamb, belong to the Duke of Devonshire, who re-lets them, and the occupiers compound with the takers. The land is divided among 1 9 resident and 7 non resident proprietors ; the principal of whom are His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, who owns nearly the whole of the buildings in the town, and upwards of 1000 acres of land in the township ; George Goodwin, esq. Samuel Barker and Thomas Buxton, gents. Messrs. William and Ralph Birch, William, Joseph and George Swann, John Bennett, William Cotterell, Robert Nail, sen. and jun. Joseph and John Turner, George Hobson, John Ward, George Wood, Joseph Vernon, Thomas Cooper, William Dawson, Ensor, Turner, Farmer, Mrs. Pott, and Mrs. Ann Finney. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a35810. 4_. 2d. The average of five years' parochial expenses, including poor, county rate, constables' accounts, and the repairs of the by-ways, is \u00a3505. and the church rate about \u00a342. per annum. The parishioners join Middlewich House of Industry, where the paupers are sent at a cost of 2s. per week each. There are two men's clubs, one endowed parochial school, one Sunday school at the Wesleyan Methodist chapel, maintained by the voluntary contributions of the society, one Calvinist chapel, three bridges, two across the Wye, and one across Hogshaw brook, which are repaired at the ex pense of the county, and fifteen Inns in the township. Buxton is parcel of the king's manor of the High Peak, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. His Grace holds a court annually."], [229, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 203 Antiquarians have disagreed as to the derivation of the name. Dr. Jones, one of the earliest writers concerning Buxton, conjectures the name to be derived from the stags, or bucks, taking soyle there when wounded, whence it was called, by the foresters, Buckstand. And as the place formed a part of the king's great forest of the Peak (Picus) which was certainly well stocked with deer of various kinds, the conjecture is ingenious. Mr. Gough traces the name from boc, and coxit ; that is, the warm springs among rocks ; and Dr. Pearson thinks the name may have originated from the German bockstein, or the English stein-bock, or wild goat. The pronunci ation of the word Bockstein certainly comes nearer the name as written in Doomsday Survey, viz. Bawkestanes. \u2014 These are the vague conjectures of antiquarians. They would have found a more simple derivation from the Saxon word, which gives us the word bucket, and from which a basket of linen carried to be washed was called the bucking-basket. The Buck or Bucking-Stanes, meant simply rocks that were frequented, as they are now, for the purposes of bathing. The antiquity of this now fashionable watering-place has been clearly proved by the most re nowned antiquarians. That its warm springs were known to the Romans, is evident from various concurring circumstances. Several ancient roads concentrate at this place, particularly two great military roads \u2014 the one connecting Manchester with Little Chester, and the other running from Middlewich and Congleton to Brough, near Hope, in the Peak, and thence to York and Aid borough. The latter, called the Bathway, or Bathomgate, was traced by the late Dr. Pegge ; the former is known in different parts of its course by the appellation of High Street, Street Fields, Street Lane, eye. Dr. Gale, as appears from a manuscript of his, quoted in Gough's Additions to the Britannia, by Camden, placed the Aquis of Ravennas at Buxton. Specimens of Roman work manship have been discovered here. Bishop Gibson mentions a Roman wall cemented with red plaster, close by St. Anne's well, where are the ruins of the ancient bath. This wall was taken down in 1709, when Sir Thomas Delves, a Cheshire gentleman, in memory of a cure he had re ceived by virtue of the waters, erected a small stone alcove over the well. Some capacious leaden cisterns, and various articles, apparently Roman, were discovered in digging the foundation. In 1781, at the time the building of the crescent commenced, the shape and dimensions of the an cient bath was found to be thirty feet from east to west, and fifteen in a contrary direction. The spring was situate at the west end, ancl at the east there was a flood-gate to let out the water ; this bath was about seven yards from the present bath-room. The wall was built with limestone, covered on the outside with a strong cement ; the floor consisted of a composition of lime mixed with coarse sand saturated with blood ; near one end a cavity was formed in the floor resembling the figure of a boat. Though the remote appropriation of the Buxton waters is apparent from the above circum stances, neither the Saxon or Monkish annalists furnish any testimony, as to their having been in use in the middle ages. It seems probable, however, notwithstanding the wild, bleak, barren re gion in which it is situate ; a region, inhabited by wild beasts, and subject to depredations of every description, in a thinly inhabited district ; that they never were entirely deserted ; though we have no certain record of their having obtained a high degree of reputation prior to the six teenth century, when Dr. Jones, an eminent physician, living at King's Meade, in Derby, gave them celebrity by publishing a treatise on the beneficial qualities of the Buxton waters. It ap pears, when this curious work, entitled, \" Buckstone's Bathes Benefyte,\" issued from the press, in 1572, the waters were then in high repute, and the place of considerable resort. The first con venient house for the reception of visitants was erected a short time previous to this publication, by the Earl of Shrewsbury, on the site of the building now called The Hall, a part of which be longed to the old fabric. This, in the verbose manner of that age, Dr. Jones described as follows : \" Joyninge to the chiefe springe betwene the river and the bathe, is a very goodly house, foure square, foure stories hye, so well compacte with houses of office beneath, and above, and round about, with a great chambre and other goodly lodgings to the number of thirty : that it is and will be a bewty to beholde, and very notable for the honora ble and worshipfull that shall neede to repaire thither, as also for other. Yea, the poorest shall have lodgings and beds hard by for their uses only. The baths also so beutified with seats round about ; defended from the ambyent"], [230, "204 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER ayre ; and chimneys for fyre, to ayre your garments in the bathes syde, and other necessaryes most decent. And truely I suppose that if there were for the sicke, a sanctuarie during their abode there, for all causes saving sacri ledge, treason, murther, burglary, rape, and robbing by the hyeway syde, with also a lycense for the sicke to eat flesh at all tymes, and a Fryday market weekely, and two fayres yeerely, it should be to the posterities, not only commo diouse, but also to the prince, great honour and gayne.\" It seems that the hall and baths had not long been constructed, and that other improvements were then in con templation. Dr. Jones speaks of a \"phisicion,\" (probably himself) to be \"placed there continually, that might not only counsayle therein, how the better to use God's benefyte, but also adapt theire bodyes making artificiall bathes, by usinge thereof as the case shall requyre, with many other profitable devyses, having all things for that use or any other, in a redinesse for all the degrees as before it bee longe it shall bee seene of the noble Earle's own performing.\" To the gentlemen, Dr. Jones recommends as exercise, bowling, shooting at butts, and tossing the wind ball. \" The ladyes, gentlewomen, wy ves, and maydes, maye, in one of the galleries walke ; and if the weather bee not agreeable to theire expectacion they may have in the ende of a bench eleven holes made, into the whiche to trowle pummetes or bowles of leade, bigge, little, or meane, or also of copper, tynne, woode, eyther vyolent or softe, after theire owne discretion, the pastyme Troule in Madam is termed.

This building occasioned the waters to be much more resorted to than heretofore by all ranks of people. Mary Queen of Scots, being at that time in the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and Elizabeth his Countess ; the Earl, by the permission of Queen Elizabeth, reluctantly obtained, visited Buxton four times with his illustrious prisoner.* In one of these visits this heroic and ill-fated princess applied to Buxton, C\u00e6sar's verses upon Filtria, with some alteration.

Buxton, whose fame thy milk-warm waters tell, Whom I, perhaps, no more shall see, farewell. \u2022 Her first journey to Buxton appears to have been in the year 1573 : Lord Shrewsbury, speaking of his application for permission to repair to Buxton wells for her health, speaks thus, in a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham. \" Whereas she hath put hur Majestie in mynde of hur jorney to Buxton well, and you refarre to my consyderacion the conve nyerice and meteness thereof, and what nede she hath of that bane ; and if hur jorney thedder be nedeful and fytte, then howe it may be done convenyently ; and thereof I to sartefy hur Majestie, I can saye lyttell of the state of hur boddy ; she semes more helthfull now, and all the last yere past, than before ; she hath very myche used baning wt yerbes now of late, as she hath done other yers ; what nede she hath of Buxton well I knowe nott further than I have here wrytt ; my L.

The following instructions from Lord Burleigh to the Earl of Shrewsbury, will show how loth the Queen was to give her permission, and with what caution her first visit (and of course equal caution was observed in all subsequent visits) was conducted. \" Her Majesty is pleased, that if your L. shall think you may wt out perill conduct the Q. of Scotts to ye well of Buckston, accordyng to her most ernest desyre your L. shall so doo, usyng such care and respect for hir person, to contynew in your chardg, as hytherto your L. hath honorably, happely, and avisably doone : and whan your L. shall determyn to remove wt the said Q. thythar, it wer good yt as little forknolledg abrode as may conveniently be given ; and nevertheless, yt for ye tyme yt she shall be ther, yt all others, being strangers from your L.'s company, be forbydden to come thyther duryng ye tyme of ye sayd Quene's abode there.

The Queen of Scots was at Buxton again in 1576. Ibid. ii. p. 149. In a letter to Lord Burleigh, without date, which was written after her second visit to Buxton, alluding to some false reports which had been made to the Queen, the Earl of Shrewsbury says, \" Touching the doubtfullness her Maty. should have of me in gyvyng the Scotes Q. lybarte to be sene and saluted ; suerly, my L. the reportars thereof to her Maty, hathe done me grete wronge : In dede at her fyrst beinge there, ther hapenyd a pore lame crepell to be in the lowar unknowne to all my pepell that garded the plase, and whan she hard that there was women in the she desiered some good gentylwoman to gyve her a smoke ; wherupon they putt one of ther smokes out of a hole in the walle to her, and so soone as it came to my knolege, I was bothe offended wt her, and my pepell for takeyng any lettarr unto her ; and after that tyme I toke such ordar as no pore pepell cam unto the house duryng that tyme ; nether at the seconde tyme was ther any strangar at Buxtons (but my one pepell) that sawe her, for that I gave such charge to the contrey about, none should come in to behold her.\" Ibid. vol. ii. p. 247."], [231, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 205 We find the Queen's favourite ministers, Leicester and Burleigh,* among the noble visitors at Buxton. Buxton now became a place of considerable resort for all classes, both for health and pleasure, and it was found necessary to increase the buildings for their accommodation. We find, by the legislative enactments in the 39th of Elizabeth, that the itinerant migrations ofthe poor were re strained, and they were more closely confined to their parishes. In a clause in this Act it is pro vided, that, the poor, who, from disease or infirmity, might have occasion to resort to Bath or Buxton, should have relief from their several parishes, and a pass from two magistrates, fixing the period of their return : this provision clearly shows the high estimation in which the Buxton waters were hed at this period, and evinces a solicitude to guard against vagrancy and begging, that appears to have been prevalent at that time. The antiquity of the baths at Buxton has already been mentioned in the first part of this work ; and it seems probable that they were not deserted during the Saxon and Norman periods of his tory. There is, however, no record of their having obtained any high degree of reputation until the sixteenth century. Shortly previous to the publication of Dr. Jones, which we have already mentioned, a convenient house for the reception of visitants had been erected by the Earl of Shrewsbury, on the site of the building, now called the Hall. In 1670, a new and enlarged edi fice was erected on the same spot, by William, the third Earl of Devonshire. This building has subsequently been greatly improved, and is now one of the principal hotels for the reception of company. Within it are the baths. \u2014 The baths, tepid by nature, are six in number : one public and two private for gentlemen, and the same, for ladies. There is also the charity bath. \u2014 The new hot baths were constructed upon a plan devised by the late Mr. Charles Sylvester, under the patronage of the Duke of Devonshire. These baths are lined with Italian marble and porcelain In 1580, we find that the Earl of Shrewsbury went to Buxton a third time with his charge. The Earl, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, dated Aug. 9, 1580, says, \" I cam heddar to Buxtons wt my charge, the 28 of July. She hadde a harde begynnenge of her jorney ; for whan she shuld have taken her horse, he started asyde, and therwith she fell and hurt hur bake, wch she still complaines oft\", notwithstanding she applyes the bathe ons or twyse a daye. I doo strictly obsarve hur Maties. commandment, wrytten to me by yor L. in restreyninge all resorte to this plase ; nether dothe she see, norr is seene to any more than to hur owne pepell and suche as I appoynt to attende : she hathe nott come forthe of the house synce hur cumynge, nor shall nott before hur departynge.\" Ibid. vol. ii. p. 239. The re mainder of this letter complains of an abatement of the allowance for the Queen of Scots' provision, by which it seems that, besides the many inconveniences and distresses which attended his odious and burdensome office, he was incur ring a considerable pecuniary loss. It appears that the Earl of Shrewsbury was at Buxton again with his illustrious charge in 1582, (Ibid. ii. p. 2/1.) and this seems to have been the Queen of Scots' last visit to Buxton. We find that in 157b', the Queen so ordered her progress, that she might remain twenty-one days within sufficient distance of Buxton for the Earl of Leicester to have the Buxton waters brought to him daily, the physicians having resolved that wheresoever the Earl of Leicester was, \" he must drynke and use Buxtons water twenty dayes together.' (Lodge's Illustrations, vol. ii. p. 150.) In 1577, the Queen writes a letter of thanks to the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury, for accommodating the Earl of Leicester with lodgings at Buxton, discharging his diet, and presenting him with a very rare present. * It appears that Lord Burleigh had been at Buxton (probably more than once) before 15/3. See Lodge vol. ii. p. 109. He was there again in 1575, when Queen Elizabeth became jealous of him (though her favourite and trusty minister) as favouring the Queen of Scots, and supposed that the reason of his going thither was, that he might the more readily hold intelligence with her by means of the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury, Ibid. vol. ii. p. 131. In 1577, he went again to Buxton with the Queen's permission. Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, isa letter from Lord Burleigh to the Earl of Sussex, Lord Cham berlain, who, it appears, had recently been at Buxton, the letter being dated \" From Buxton in your chamber,\" July 31, 1577. The following is an extract : Your Lordship, I think, desyreth to heare of my estate, which is this ; I cum hither on Sunday last at night, took a small solutive on Monday; began on Tuesday, yesterday I drynk ofthe water to the quantity of 3 pynts at 6 draughts ; this day I have added two draughts, and 1 drynk 4 pynts, and to-morrow am determyned to drynk 5 pynts, and mixt with sugar I fynd it potable with pleasure even as whey. I meane not to bath these 8 dayes, but wyll contynew drynking 10 dayes. Here are in company, Mr. Roger Manners, for whose company I hartily thank your Lordship, Sir William Fitzwilliam, Thomas Cecill, my Lady Harrington, Mr. Edmunds, with sondreye others. The weather is dry, but yet cold with wynds. By a letter from the Earl of Sussex, dated Aug. 7, 1582, it appears that the Buxton water was by some drank in still larger quantities than Lord Burleigh used it. \" The water,\" says he, \" I have drunke liberally begynning with thre pynts, and so cncreasyng dayly a pynt I come to 8 pynts, and from thens descendyng dayly a pynt till I shall ageyne reterne to 3 pynts, wch wil be on Thursdye next, and then I make an ende.\" Lodge's Illustrations, vol. 2. p. 282."], [232, "206 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER tiles, and the water, naturally in temperament 78\u00b0 Fahrenheit, may be raised to any degree of heat, by the action of steam. \u2014 The waters of Buxton are considered to be of particular service in cases of bilious cholic; and are said to restore the tone of the stomach after diarrh\u0153as and dys enteries, and to have been found of great use in the cure of diabetes. They are also celebrated for the cure of rheumatic complaints ; and in cases of paralysis, they have been preferred to those of Bath. The waters are considerably lower in temperament than those of Bath, but are higher than those of Matlock or Bristol. The almost invariable temperature of the water, as it rises in the baths, is 82\u00b0 Fahr. but sometimes, according to the observations of Dr. Pearson, it has been a quarter of a degree lower. From the analysis of that gentleman, who was one of the earliest and most successful enquirers into the chemical character of these waters, there are 15| grains of sediment in one gallon, viz. carbonate of lime, 1 1*5 grs. ; sulphate of lime, 2-5 grs. ; muriate of soda VI 5 grs. Medicinally, these waters seem entitled to the appellation of a mild, saline mineral : they are perfectly pellucid, and owing, very probably, to the presence of azotic gas, they are devoid of that vapid taste, so observable in common water, when heated to the same temperature. The able and intelligent surgeon to the Buxton Bath Charity (Mr. T. J. Page) to whose excellent observations on the Buxton waters we are much indebted, states, that \" the more obvious effects of these waters are those of a mild stimulant and tonic ; increasing, in a remarkable degree, the strength and energy ofthe nervous system. Their salutary effects on the digestive organs are not less conspicuous ; restoring tone to the debilitated stomach, and often regulating the action of the intestinal canal and urinary organs, after every other means have failed.\" The same gentleman interdicts the use of them \" during the actual existence of any undue determination of blood to particular organs ; during the existence of all febrile and inflammatory action ; and in all visceral obstructions.\" In the \" Observations on Buxton Waters\" by Dr. Denman, we find these waters considered as more actively remedial than they have been by other persons esteemed to be. He, however, dissuades from the use of them in all inflammatory and feverish complaints, and limits the quantity to be taken, in cases where the use of them may be efficacious, to a moderate portion. \" In common,\" he observes, \"two glasses, each of the size of a third of a pint, are as much as ought to be drunk before breakfast, at the distance of forty minutes between each ; and one or two of the same glasses between breakfast and dinner will be quite sufficient.\" With respect to bathing, he recommends for invalids, the time between breakfast and dinner as the most proper ; and directs that the prescribed or usual exercise, should be taken before going into the bath ; the water never to be drunk immediately previous to bathing. \u2014 Mr. Page gives the following five rules, with respect to bathing. 1st. To go into the bath about the middle of the day. 2nd. To go into the bath when the body is warm. 3rd. To go in with the feet first. 4th. To remain in the water, at first, but a very short time. 5th. To bathe on alternate days, or to miss every third day. Persons who resort to the Duke's houses have the exclusive privilege of bathing before nine o'clock. St. Anne's Well is a chaste little building, of the Grecian order, in front of the south-west wing of the Crescent. Here the water is usually taken ; it is conveyed by a pipe into a white Italian marble basin ; the well-women, who are always in attendance, serve it out to the visitants. Close by this building is a double pump, from which both cold and warm water is obtained ; this was formerly regarded as one of the wonders of the Peak, but later discoveries amongst the wonders of nature, have, with the great progress of science, lessened the importance of them. Centuries ago, the chapel of St. Anne, the tutelary saint of these hot springs, was hung round with the crutches of those who had come infirm and lame to try the sanative powers of these wa ters, and had returned \" leaping and rejoicing.\" A zeal for reform destroyed these reliques, which were supposed to have a tendency to perpetuate error and delusions. The following letter, addressed to lord Cromwell, in the reign of Henry VIII. is an interesting and curious document as connected with the history of Buxton, and illustrative ofthe complacent subserviency of some of the principal families k) that reign. .\"' .-A"], [233, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 207 \" Right Honourable and my inespecial Good Lord. \"According to my bounden duty, and the tenor of your Lordship's letters lately to me directed, I have sent your Lordship by this bearer, my brother Francis Basset, the images of Saint Anne of Buckston, and Saint Andrew of Burton-upon-Trent, which images I did take from the places where they did stand, and brought them to my house within forty-eight hours after the contemplation of your said Lordship's letters, in as sober a manner as my little and rude will would serve me. And for that there should be no more idolatry and superstition there used, I did not only deface the tabernacles and places where they did stand, but also did take away crutches, shirts, and shifts, with wax offered, being things that allure and entice the ignorant to the said ofTering; also giving the keepers of both places orders that no more offerings should be made in those places till the King's pleasure and your Lordship's be further known in that behalf. \" My Lord, I have locked up and sealed the baths and wells of Buckston, that none shall enter to wash there till your Lordship's pleasure be further known ; whereof I beseech your good Lordship that I may be ascertained again at your pleasure, and I shall not fail to execute your Lordship's commandments to the utmost of my little wit and power. And my Lord, as touching the opinion of the people and the fond trust they did put in those images, and the vanity of the things, this bearer can tell your Lordship better at large than I can write, for he was with me at the doing of all this, and in all places, as knoweth good Jesus, whom ever have your Lordship in his precious keeping. \" Written at Langley with the rude and simple hand of your assured and faithful orator, and as one and ever at your commandment, next unto the King's, to the uttermost of his little power. \"WILLIAM BASSETT, Knight. \" To Lord Cromwell.\" Buildings. The Crescent is a magnificent pile of building, erected about half a century ago, by the command ofthe Duke of Devonshire, from the design, and under the superintendence of John Carr, esq. an eminent provincial architect. The building is situate in a valley on the banks of the river Wye, and cannot be seen to advantage until you are close upon it ; its erection was dictated by a spirit of munificence, and it is executed in a style of grandeur as if designed for the residence of a prince. It consists of three stories ; the lowest one is a rusticated arcade, forming a beautiful promenade, which extends the whole length of the front, and is 7 feet wide within the pillars, and 11 feet high. An elegant balustrade skirts the front and ends of the fabric : the span of which is 3l6|feet. The divisions between the windows over the piers ofthe arcade, are formed of fluted Doric pilasters, that support the architrave and cornice, the triglyphs of the former, and the rich planceer of the latter have a striking effect. The termination above the cor nice is formed by another balustrade, that extends the length of the building, in the centre of which are the Devonshire Arms, neatly carved in wood. In the space between the windows runs an enriched string course. The span of the Crescent is 200 feet, and each wing measures 5S feet 3 inches. The floor of the arcade is raised considerably higher than the gravelled area, between which, communications are formed by several flights of steps. Each wing of the Crescent con tains an hotel ; that to the east being the Great Hotel, that to the west the St. Anne's Hotel ; in the centre is the Centre Hotel, and one private lodging-house (which is the St. Anne's Hotel lodging-house) the lower front rooms of which are converted into shops. The assembly-room forms part of the Great Hotel ; it is an elegant and well-proportioned apartment, with a rich projecting cornice, and various appropriate and beautiful ornaments ; the length of this room is 75^ feet, the width 30 feet, and the height 30 feet. The number of windows in the whole Cres cent is 378. It is built with gritstone obtained near the spot, and faced with fine freestone, pro cured from a quarry about two miles distant. The stables at the back of the Crescent, belonging to the Duke of Devonshire's Hotels, are supposed to be the handsomest in Europe \u2014 these constitute a fine range of buildings ; their style of architecture happily corresponds with the grandeur of that noble edifice. They are situate on a gently rising ground, forming on the outside an irregular polygon, but having a circular area within, sixty yards in diameter ; round this is a covered gallery, or ride, where the company take exercise on horseback when the weather renders shelter necessary ; the ride, inside the circus, is 1 60 yards round ; on one side of the stables is a spacious repository for carriages. These build ings, like the Crescent, were constructed at the charge ofthe Duke of Devonshire, who is said to have expended the sum of \u00a3120,000. in completing the whole."], [234, "208 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The Hall Bank is a range of buildings on the hill opposite the Hall, and from their elevation may be esteemed the most pleasant in Buxton. The Square is a plain substantial building, having an arcade which communicates with that of the Crescent, thus making a covered walk of considerable extent. The new church is an elegant structure of freestone, ofthe Tuscan order, erected at the expense ofthe Duke of Devonshire, on a pleasant and convenient site, south-west of the Crescent. The east front has large columns, supporting a massive pediment, in the execution of which, very large blocks of stone have been used ; the masonry is excellent, and the building has altogether an air of substantial grandeur ; the interior is elegantly finished, and in a style that is extremely chaste. All the angles of the edifice are rusticated with huge blocks of stone. The west end is orna mented with an elegant tower, and the whole building is very properly surrounded by a broad pavement that is brought close up to its wall. The church, dedicated to St. John, stands in the township of Fairfield, in the parish of Hope. It was opened for divine service on the 9th of August, 1812. By an Act of Parliament, 51 Geo. III. the patronage of this chapel, and that of Baslow, was given to the Duke of Devonshire ; and in lieu of this patronage, lands, of the value of \u00a395. per annum, and the patronage of the vicarage of Tutbury, in Staffordshire, are given to the vicar of Bakewell. In 1728, Mr. John Needham gave \u00a3200. in aid of Queen Anne's bounty. The living, a peculiar, in the diocess of Lichfield and Coventry, valued in the king's books at \u00a35. has been augmented by \u00a3400. subscribed, royal bounty \u00a3400. and by a parliamentary grant of \u00a3800. The Rev. George Trevor Spencer is the incumbent. The old church at Buxton, a very mean building, is now converted into a school-room. It for merly contained a statue of St. Anne, to whom, the superstition of former times attributed the miraculous power of performing all the cures that the medicinal qualities of the water had effected. This object of superstitious veneration was destroyed at the Reformation : since which time, the waters have been found to possess all those healing powers that were attributed to the Saint. After the Reformation, the church was dedicated to St. John; the ostensible object of this chano-e of the patron saint from St. Anne to St. John, was for the purpose of removing the superstition that clouded the minds of the lower classes of the community. The removal of the cause was certainly calculated to effect that intention, yet the change did not entirely eradicate the remem brance of St. Anne; so prone was human nature to superstition, that it still clung to its object and the name of St. Anne was kept appended to the well. Although the name is continued, the superstition has long since vanished away. Monumental Tablets iu Buxton old Church, which is now converted into a school room. To the memory of the Hon.

The origin of this charity we are not enabled to trace. In the reign of Elizabeth, a similar institution seems to have had the support of the wealthy who visited the place at that period. It appears from Dr. Jones, \" Buckstone's Bathes Benefit,\" already quoted, that, in 1572, there was a fixed rate to be paid by all persons resorting to the waters, towards a fund, one-half of which was for the physician, the other for the benefit of poor bathers. \" Alway, provided the day of your coming thither be noted before you enter into the bathes, and the day of your departure, with the country of your habitation, condition, or calling, with the infirmityes or cause you came for, in the regyster booke, kept of the warden of the bathe, or the physician, that there shall be appointed, and the benefite you receyved, paying fourpence for the recording, and every yeoman besides twelve pence, every gentleman, 3s. ; every esquier, 3s. id.; every knight, 6s. 8d. ; every lord and baron, 10_. ; every viscount, 13s. id.; every erle, 20s.; every marques, 30.. ; every duke, \u00a33. 10.. ; every archbishop, \u00a35. ; every bishop, 40.. ; every judge, 20_. ; every doctour and sergeant at lawe, 10. ; every chauncellor and utter-barrister, 6s.

Sd.; every gentle woman, 2.. ; and all for the treasure of the bathe, to the use of the poore, that only for help do come thither, the one halfe ; the other to the physician, for his residence.\" The annual reports of this valuable and well-conducted charity, now lying before us, for three successive years, is a convincing proof of the extent and utility of this benevolent and unostenta tious institution; established for the relies of the poor, resorting to Buxton for the benefit ofthe bath waters. This charity is principally supported by a trifling contribution from the visitors ; whenever any new comers arrive, either at the inns or the principal lodging houses, immediately after dinner, a subscription-book is introduced, in which those who are charitably disposed insert their names, and pay Is. each towards the relief of those who suffer the double affliction of pain and poverty. This little donation, as Mr. Rhodes justly observes, \"blesseth him that takes, and those who give ; it purchases the gratifying privilege of recommending a person to the charity. On his or her admission, a letter (post paid) to the Secretary ofthe Charity, stating the nature ofthe com plaint, age, character, and circumstances of the patient, receives a reply from the Secretary. Other patients are admitted on bringing a certificate from the minister of their parish and medical attendant, vouching for their being proper objects of charity. The sums received from the one shilling subscription, from private donations, and from the handsome collections made after two sermons preached for the benefit ofthe establishment during the season, are considerable. By the provision of this valuable institution every invalid duly recommended, has the advantage of medical advice, medicine, and the use of a bath, which is exclusively appropriated to this pur pose; together with an allowance of 5*. weekly for three weeks, if standing in need of such pe cuniary aid. A charity conducted on such liberal principles, and furnished with such abundant evidence of its utility, possesses strong claims to the support of the wealthy part of the public. e e"], [236, "210 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Extract from the Annual Reports of Receipts and Expenditure ofthe Charily.

Scenery. \u2014 Within the last half century, the neighbourhood of Buxton has been much improved by cultivation and plantations, judiciously arranged on the adjacent hills, by the command ofthe Dukes of Devonshire. The present noble Duke, following the example of his illustrious father, is continually adding to the rides, walks and plantations in the vicinity. The serpentine walk commences opposite the square, winding beautifully on each side of the Wye. The walks are well laid out, the cascades and bridges have a good effect, and the trees, which are shooting into beauty, render it a delightful spot. The more recent improvements on St. Anne's Cliffe were de signed by Sir Jeffery Wyattville, and render that hill a highly ornamental pleasure ground, har monizing with the classic architecture of Carr. A series of terrace walks, one above another, sweep in a circular direction, to agree with the convex form of the hill, and communicate with each other by flights of steps at each end and in the centre of the different walks. Numerous seats are placed on the walks for the accommodation of the company, and beautiful vases ornament the whole. If the exquisite taste and munificence of the present owner of Buxton is continued, this fashionable place will become, in a few years, equally celebrated for its sylvan scenery as it"], [237, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 211 is for the salubrity of its air and the efficacy of its waters. Half a century ago, Buxton was described as being situate amidst the most dreary and cheerless scenery in the Peak of Derby shire ; and the country as exhibiting one wide extent of hopeless sterility. To the admirers of rock scenery, the neighbourhood of Buxton affords ample scope for the imitative powers of the most enthusiastic artist ; for the effusions of the most brilliant poetic fancy ; and for gratification to all who admire the beauties of nature in her wildest garb. To the mineralogist it offers many a rare and beautiful fossil ; but to the botanist it is a source of incalculable delight : for there is scarcely a plant indigenous in Britain which may not be found on the mountains or in the valleys. To the angler, the pellucid waters of the Wye and the Dove furnish the beautiful finny tribe of trout and grayling, so celebrated by Cotton and Walton. To the sportsman, during the shooting season, the extensive moors belonging to the Duke of Devonshire and the Earl of Derby, abound ing with grouse, partridges, snipes, dotterell, plover, &c. have their attraction. The Races at Buxton, we believe, are permanently fixed for the Wednesday and Thursday sub sequent to the first Sunday after Trinity. A subscription pack of hariers are kept in the neighbourhood, and the chase in this moun tainous district forms a striking and pleasing contrast to those gentlemen who have followed this diversion in low countries. Thus it will appear that Buxton is a place of resort for pleasure as well as for health. The amusements of Buxton generally commence in June and end in October. Besides those already noticed, we may add billiards, plays, assemblies, and the card-room. The balls are held in the Assembly-room, at the great Hotel, and are well attended. The dress balls are on Wednesday nights ; the undress on Mondays and Fridays. An elegant card-room, ad joining the assembly-room, is open every night. The subscription to the ball and card-rooms is one guinea : but if a family subscribe, the charge is one guinea each for the two first, and half a guinea each for the rest of the family. The subscription to the news-room for the season is six shillings. An excellent band of musicians attend, by command of the Duke of Devonshire, who supports them. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, a small theatre is opened, neatly fitted up, and fre quented by a respectable company of comedians. The natural curiosities in the neighbourhood, generally visited by the company, are Poole's Hole, about one mile to the west of the town, celebrated for its wonderful crystallizations; Axe- edge hill, 2^ m. west, out of which issue four rivers, the Dove, the Wye, the Dane and the Goyle ; the two first fall into the eastern estuary, the latter into the western. From this eminence may be seen, on a clear day, the mountains of North Wales, and the light-house beyond Liverpool. Kinder-Scout, a mountain of still greater elevation, 1 0 m. north of Buxton, where there is an ex- traordinary waterfall that is the head of the river Sett. The Marvel-stones, 3 m on the Chapel- en-le-Frith road. Combes Moss, about 3 m. N. W. on which are some ancient military works, consisting of two deep trenches, running parallel to each other to an extent of about 200 yards. That which lies nearest to the edge of the hill is carried down the declivity by two traverses, and reaches nearly a quarter of a mile, and is much wider than the other. Chee Tor, 6 m. to the S. near the village of Wormhill, on the banks of the Wye, is a prodigious limestone rock, which rises perpendicularly from the river to the height of 360 feet ; and in most places, except where the mountain-ash, ivies, brambles and hazels, have grown out of the fissures in its front, is quite naked. In some parts it considerably overhangs the river, and seems to threaten destruction to the spectator. Near the boldest projection of the Tor, a view admirably adapted to the pencil is presented. The views in Chee-dale and Monsal-dale, though of the same general character, are agreeably diversified. Rhodes, in his Peak Scenery, says, this secluded dell abounds in pictures ; every change of place exhibits a new one, and every one that occurs is marked with a peculiar beauty. The other most interesting dales are Dove-dale, about 18 m. S. from Buxton. This dale has a peculiar character ; its detached perpendicular rocks stamp it with an image entirely its own, and for this reason it affords the greater pleasure. No admirer of na ture should neglect to visit Dove-dale ; for on the whole, here are the most picturesque scenes"], [238, "212 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER any where to be met with. Middleton-dale, 10 m. E. from Buxton, through Wye-dale and Mil lers-dale, is a deep chasm, which in grandeur and beauty is inferior to few of the valleys described. Elden Hole, in the same direction, is a perpendicular cleft in the measure of limestone, situate in the Peak Forest. It is a deep chasm, extending lengthways, in the direction of N. E. and S. W. Near the surface it is about ten yards wide and thirty long, but it gradually contracts, and at the depth of 90 feet from the surface the passage is much diminished. It is exceedingly deep, and abounds in the most beautiful stalactites and encrustations. Castleton is about 12 m. N. E. from Buxton, and is the scene of Sir Walter Scott's Peverel ofthe Peak ; the ruined Castle, the mag nificent Cavern, called Peak Hole, the Speedwell Mine, Mam Tor, called the shivering mountain, and a variety of objects give peculiar attractions to this interesting neighbourhood. The Ebbing and Flowing Well is about 4^ m. from Buxton, on the road to Castleton, at a place called Barmoor Clough. This natural phenomenon is worthy the attention of the curious visitor ; it is situate near the turnpike road, at the foot of a steep hill, rising more than 100 feet to the west. In dry weather it flows about once an hour, and in wet four times. One mile from Buxton, in Wye-dale, is a narrow tremendous chasm ; a steep and craggy precipice, known by the name of the Lover's- Leap, in this dale, requires some firmness of mind to look down it without producing feelings of terror. A new road winds along the dale, by the side of the river Wye, to Bakewell and Chats worth, in a most romantic manner. Here hill and dale, rock, wood and water are so harmonized, as to heighten the charms of this beautiful ride. \u2014 The natural features ofthe county, and the an cient tumulis, Roman stations, druidical circles, rocking-stones, &c. are more fully described in the first part of this work. A large quantity of lime is annually burnt in this township for agricultural purposes, prin cipally for the Cheshire farmers ; and when the new rail-road is completed the demand will be still greater. The hillocks produced by the ashes are excavated and formed into habitations for the work people. Cadhouse Lane, in Repton and Ticknall. CALDWELL, a village, hamlet, constabulary, and chapelry, 2 m. S. of Drakelow, in the parish Caldewelle, of Stapenhill, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley. In 1821, there were in ' this hamlet 31 houses, 33 families, and 157 persons, now about 180, who are entirely supported by agriculture and trades connected therewith. This village takes its name from the cold springs which abound in the neighbourhood. It is one of the most rural and pleasant agricultural villages south of the Trent ; the site of it com mands extensive prospects over the Trent and the Dove valleys to the distant hills of the Peak ; no public roads intersect it : the excellent houses, composed of red brick, made in the township, are surrounded by ancient elms, limes, firs, and other forest and ornamental timber, and large gardens. The township of Caldwell is bounded by Rosliston, S. W. ; Linton, S. E. ; and Drakelow, N. : the extent is 1028 acres of good land, principally a red marl on a rock substratum, wa tered by numerous powerful springs. The land is divided between nine proprietors; viz. the lady ofthe manor, Miss Rebeckah Evans, 18 acres ; the Corporation of Repton School and Etwall Hospital, 165 acres; Messrs. Thomas Pratt, 255 acres; Thomas Freer, 112 a. 2 r. 3 p. ; William Campion, 112 acres; Thomas Moss, 160 acres; Thomas Leedham, 1 60 acres ; John Campion, 44 acres. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a32162. 17_. 6d. The poor, county, and church rates, with the constables' accounts and highways, average about \u00a3265. per annum. A complete revolution has taken place in the owners of property in this township since 1758. The parishioners support a Sunday-school. In Caldewelle, Alfric had two carucates of land to be taxed.

The manor belonged to the Abbot of Burton ; it appears that Henry de Collingwood and others held considerable lands here, 30 Edward III. as homagers to the abbot of Burton, which family t"], [239, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 213 of Collingwood long afterwards held it. In 37 Henry VIII. the king granted to Sir William Paget, his secretary, the manor of Winshill, Stapenhill, Mickleover, Littleover, Finderne, and Caldwell, and part of the abbey of Burton on its dissolution. In 156o, Sir Henry Paget, knt. afterwards Lord Paget, his son, alienated the manor of Caldwell to Peter Collingwood, and his heirs, who died 29 Elizabeth, and left his estate here, and at Barton, co. Stafford, to his two nieces, daughters of his brother Ralph; Ellen, the eldest, married John Stone, clerk; and Mar gery, the younger, Thomas Sanders, of Lullington, esq. In 1653, Collingwood Sanders died seised of the manor of Caldwell. In 1758, Samuel Sanders, esq. owned the manor; from this family it passed by marriage to the Mortimers. It was the property of Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, Secretary to the Royal Society, whose son, Hans Winthorpe Mortimer, esq. sold it to Henry Evans, of Burton-upon-Trent, esq. ; it is now the property of Miss Rebeckah Evans, (see Pedi gree of this family.) Edward II. when in pursuit of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who was then with his adherents at Burton-upon-Trent, halted with his army at Caldwell ; the king was attended by the Earls of Surrey, Richmond, Pembroke, and other eminent persons. This was not long before the battle of Boroughbridge, in 1322. Caldwell church stands on a pleasant site, surrounded by a secluded church-yard : the chancel part is very ancient ; in the gable of which a rude sculpture, discovered some years ago, is fixed up. Caldwell and Stapenhill churches are supposed to be two of the oldest in the kingdom. The Rev. Henry de Voeux is the incumbent, and receives annually from the parishioners \u00a3152. 14.. in lieu of the small tithes. Formerly service was occasionally delivered in the church, now regularly once every Sabbath. Monumental Inscriptions in the Church.

There was formerly a Presbyterian meeting-house here, of which the celebrated Dr. Ebenezer Latham was minister. There is now a meeting-house of General Baptists at this place. Caldwell hall is described by Mr. Wolley, in his Manuscript History of Derbyshire, as being an old seat, removed out of a little moated piece of ground adjoining. The moat is cut out of the solid rock, and the pavement ofthe court is solid rock.t The mansion has been much improved since it came into the family of Evans. The hall is a large and handsome brick mansion, over looking a rich lawn to the south front, and a lake of water to the extent of seven acres, which is surrounded by shady walks and ornamental gardens. This charming residence is now the pro perty of Miss Rebeckah Evans, who resides at it. \" This was Colonel Thomas Sanders, of Little Ireton, an eminent Parliamentary officer, under Cromwell. See further particulars under Little Ireton, in Mugginton. t The late Adam Wolley, of Matlock, esq. has here inserted an advertisement respecting an estate sold here, con sisting of a mansion house 108 feet in front, a sheet of water of 5 acres, and 50 acres in paddock. The corn tithes of the hamlet consisting of 800 acres. The great and small tithes of the hamlet of Linton containing about 700 acres, 500 acres of land in the hamlet of Coton, 700 acres in the hamlet of Linton, as before stated, the whole containing 1340 acres, and let for \u00a32153. per annum.

The tithes belong to Sir George, who is the sole proprietor ofthe lordship The estimated annual rental of all the land and buildings is \u00a3793- The paro chial expenses, taking an average of seven years, have been \u00a360. per annum. The manor belonged to the Earl of Mercia before the conquest, who granted it to Burton abbey. In the reign of Henry VIII. it was held by Sir William Bassett, knt. who died 6 Ed ward VI. and left it to his son William ; who died 4 Elizabeth, and left it to his son William (Wolley.) In 1547, Edward VI. granted the site of the abbey to John, Earl of Warwick. In 1577, Roger Wensley, esq. possessed it, and resided at the abbey. In 1582, Richard Wensley, esq. sold the estate to Robert Bainbrigge, esq. In 1621, Mr. Bainbrigge conveyed it to Henry Harpur, esq. of Normanton, ancestor of Sir George Crewe, bart. the present proprietor. A convent of regular Canons, of the order of St. Austin, was founded at Calke, by the Earl of Mercia. Before ll6l, Ranulph, second Earl of Chester, Matilda, his wife, and their son Hugh, made considerable additions to the foundation. It was dedicated to St. Mary and St. Giles, and received endowments from various benefactors ; but chiefly from the Countess of Chester, on condition that it should be subject to the priory of Repton. The monks re moved first to Depedale (the site of Dale Abbey) and afterwards to Repton. The following is a translation of the charters to this religious house.

Here lies the body of Sir John Harpur, bart. who died the 24th of June, 1741, aged 63. In his character were happily united the true patriot, the tender husband, the indulgent parent, the worthy gentleman, and the sincere friend. The world paid this uncommon regard to the greatest good nature and humanity, that he lived and died almost without an enemy. He married Catherine, the youngest daughter of the Right Hon. Thomas lord Crewe, of Stene, in the county of Northampton, who sur vived him three years and six months, and lies interred in the same grave. She was a lady of so rare a disposi tion, that it is hard to say in which of the duties of life she excelled the most, she was eminent in every one. In the profession of religion she was steady, in the practice of it exemplary. She looked upon her birth and station not merely as marks of distinction, but as spurs to the noblest actions ; she thought earthly greatness received its fairest lustre from virtue and piety ; though she was placed far above want herself, yet affluence could never abate her humanity. She had the most merciful feeling for the distresses of others ; she made the miseries of her fellow-creatures her own. The poor found in her a sure patroness, the orphan a never-failing friend. Thus they both lived ; happy in each other, an ornament to religion, an honour to their country, a blessing to this place, equally beloved, and their loss was universally lamented. Charities.

The ancient family of Harpur is traced to the period of the Conquest. Hugo, the son of Richard le Harpur, lived at the time of Henry I. ; and his grandson Roger, who was contempo Ff"], [244, "218 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER rary with Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, bore a plain cross as his distinction. The son of Roger, Gil bert le Harpur, espoused Hawise, who was heiress of Elmedon and of Chesterton, in the county of Warwick. The grandson of Gilbert was John le Harpur, who some time early in the fifteenth century married Isabella, daughter of Sir Robert Appleby, of Rushall, in the county of Stafford, knt. Richard Harpur, Serjeant at Law and Judge of the Common Pleas, greatly aggrandized the family, and was the first that fixed at Swarkstone; he married Jane, daughter of Sir George Finderne, of Finderne, who, by the death of her brother, Thomas Finderne. esq. brought to her husband the manors of Finderne, Swarkstone, &c. Sir John Harpur, knt. the son of the Judge, was High Sheriff in 1605; and Sir Henry Harpur, the grandson of the Judge, was created a Baronet in 1626, by Charles I. and afterwards espoused the cause of that monarch, and fortified his house at Swarkstone, which was destroyed by the parliamentarians. The Baronet, who was of Calke, was the third son of Sir John Harpur, and it was his grandson, Sir John Harpur, knt. and bart. who on the death of Sir John Harpur, of Swarkstone, in 1671, succeeded to his large estates. Both branches of the family were great sufferers for their loyalty in the reign of Charles I. (See a List of those who Compounded at page 84, in the Appendix.) His son, Sir John Harpur, bart. of Calke, married Catherine, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Lord Crewe,* of Stene. Sir Henry, the son of Sir John, married one of the daughters of the Duke of Rutland: he was M. P. for Worcester and afterwards for Tamworth. The next Baronet of that name was son ofthe preceding one, and was M. P. for Derby in 1761, and sheriff in 1774- He married the second daughter ofthe Earl of Warwick. The name of Crewe was assumed by the succeeding Baronet in 1 808, by permission, under the royal sign manual. The present Baronet, Sir George Crewe, of Calke, succeeded to the title and estates ofthe family in 181 9, and was high sheriff of the county of Derby in 1821 Sir George has the inestimable reputation of being a kind and liberal landlord. He is a great encourager of agricultural improvements, and is extensively es teemed for his general benevolence and philanthropy. Sir George is lord of the manors of Ar leston and Sinfen, Boulton, Breadsall, Calke, Smisby, Stanton by Bridge, Swarkstone, Ticknall, Twyford and Stenson, &c. The principal estates of Sir George, consist of 1 1 ,000 acres in Der byshire and 23,000 acres in Staffordshire, besides the lordship of Hemmington, in the county of Leicester. \u2014 The proprietor of this work has to acknowledge respectfully, the donation of the two plates of Calke Abbey, which ornament these pages. Calke Abbey, the principal seat of Sir George Crewe, bart. was erected early in the last cen tury, by Sir John Harpur, bart. It is a noble mansion, standing in the centre of an extensive park, of which the verdant and well wooded elevations rise on all sides from the Abbey. These elevations afford rich and interesting prospects, and the valleys which intersect them are adorned with venerable oaks and other ancient forest trees. Few spots exceed this in variety, and wood intermixed with sheets of water is met with amid this charming diversity of hill and dale. Groups of deer, sheep, and cattle enliven the scene. The deer are a fine species of the fallow-deer : the sheep are a peculiar breed, called the Portland, of which notice has been taken in our Agricul tural chapter. The house is built of fine freestone, round a quadrangular court : it is large and elegant. In the centre of the south front, two flights of steps lead to the portico, the pediment of which is supported by four Ionic columns. The hall or saloon communicates with the princi pal apartments; and is 46 feet in length, 31 in width, and 29 feet in height. This saloon is richly adorned with paintings, cabinets, &c. the former presenting numerous family portraits by eminent artists, and the latter containing an abundance of well arranged fossils, shells, and other natural curiosities. Portraits of Sir George and Lady Crewe are considered to rank among the best productions of Reinagle. There are portraits, also, of the Earl and Countess of Huntingdon, Colonel Harpur, Judge Harpur, of Swarkstone, Sir John and Lady Catherine Harpur, Lady * Crewe, the name of a family, which was so called from the township of Crewe, in Cheshire, where Thomas de Crewe became possessed of a knight's fee in 1288 ; John Crewe, esq. his descendant, was for his loyalty created, 13 Charles II. Lord Crewe, of Stene; which title became extinct in 1721, at the death of Nathaniel, the third Lord, who was bishop of Durham. It was revived in the person of John Crewe, of Crewe hall, who was the descendant of another branch ofthe family, in the female line, and was created a Baron in 1806."], [245, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 219 Palmer, Lady Gough, the Duke and Duchess of Rutland, &c. To the right is the drawing-room, the dimensions of which are 29 feet 9 inches by 20 feet 3 inches. This spacious room is elegantly furnished : the walls are adorned with landscapes and other works of art ; and the sideboards are ornamented with vases of exquisite workmanship, and a costly Chinese pagoda carved in ivory. To the left is the breakfast-room, 20 feet by 1 9 feet ; and the dining-room, which is 33 feet by 28 feet. These rooms are exactly half the height of the saloon, and with it occupy the southern front. On the east is the library, 44 feet in length and 19 feet in width. It is well stored with works in every department of literature. Adjoining the library is the sitting-room of Lady Crewe, which is 17 feet 9 inches, by 1 7 feet 6 inches. In this elegant apartment are some paintings by the old masters, which are esteemed among the richest productions of the pencil. \u2014 The prospect from the eastern front is highly picturesque, comprising the varieties of a valley with lawns, woods, and water. The lower rooms consist of the private room of Sir George, and various other apartments. The upper story contains handsome chambers, connected by ex tensive passages and spacious anti-rooms ; in one of these is a collection of preserved birds, con taining specimens rare for colour and species, collected within a few miles of the house. The principal bed-chambers, &c. are upon the second story, consisting of four suites of family apart ments, seven smaller single rooms, school-room, nursery, and servants' apartments. These cham bers are all 14 feet 9 inches in height. In this house, although it has never yet been put up, either for use or ornament, is perhaps, one of the most splendid state beds in the kingdom, pre sented, on the occasion of her marriage, by Caroline, queen of George the Second, to Lady Caro line Manners (afterwards Harpur) as one of her bridemaids. This now beautiful seat was, in the memory of persons now living, one of the plainest and least ornamental, it is said, almost desolate and ugly, places in the county. The present improvements were all planned and executed by the late Sir Henry Crewe, bart. who devoted a life of retirement to this purpose, affording thereby for many years, ample employment to the workmen and labourers of the surrounding neighbour hood. The house being ill supplied with water, Sir Henry Crewe, at a great expense, brought it from an excellent spring beyond Ticknall, about a mile and a half, to a covered reservoir in the park, from whence the stables, house, gardens, and dairy, are now fully and amply supplied. The style of architecture is Ionic, highly enriched, with fluted pilasters between the windows, and an elegant balustrade round the whole building, within which is a flat roof covered with lead. The stables are excellent, and stand on an elevated site to the north of the house. CALLOW, a scattered village and hamlet (which with Ible forms a joint constabulary) is in Caldlow, Caldelawe, the parish of Wirksworth, and the inhabitants are supported by agriculture. The hamlet contains 1092 acres of gritstone and limestone land, viz. 100 acres of wood, one fourth arable, the remainder meadow and pasture, divided into farms of about 100 acres each, at an average rental of 30s. per acre. The land is well watered by the Ecclesbourn and numerous springs. The lordship is about equally divided between Hugo Malveysin Chadwick, of Malvey sin Ridware, esq. and Philip Gell, of Hopton, esq. who are joint lords of the manor. The tithes belong to the Dean of Lincoln ; they are held on lease by G. Errington, esq. who re-lets them to the occupiers at an average of 2s. 6d. per acre. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a3-1111. 10*. The average of seven years* parochial expenses is \u00a3135. Is. 6d. per annum. The inhabitants pay to Brassington House of Industry, and the paupers are sent to that house. The ancient hall is now in the occupation of Mr. German Dean, one of Mr. Chadwick's ten ants. The duchy manor exercises a paramount jurisdiction over the manor of Callow. The manor was part ofthe king's lands after the Conquest, attached to the manor of Wirksworth. At an early period it was held by the Okeover family. In the reign of Edward I. the descendant of Patrice de la Launde, whose name appears in the roll of Battel Abbey, had free warren granted in this manor. Joan, daughter of William, and one of the co-heirs of Sir John de la Launde, knt. brought this manor, by marriage, to Richard de Morley, whose daughter and heir married Hugh de Rieslep ; her daughter and namesake, Lucia, married Roger de Masey, whose daughter and"], [246, "220 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER heiress general of de la Launde, Morley, &c. Goditha, married Ralph de Statham. Joan, the great-granddaughter of the latter, in the reign of Edward IV. brought the manor to John Sa cheverell, esq. whose great-great-grandson, Henry Sacheverell, esq. who died in 1620, bequeathed it to his eldest natural son, Valens Sacheverell, esq. of Callow, co. Derby, whose son George gave a moiety of it to his great-nephew, Charles Chadwick Sacheverell, esq. : this moiety is now the property of Hugo Malveysin Chadwick, esq. The other moiety was given by George Sacheve rell, esq. to the celebrated Dr. Henry Sacheverell, rector of St. Andrew's, Holborn. The doctor's widow gave it to her third husband, Charles Chambers. It afterwards became the property of Mr. Chambers' daughter, who married Mackenzie, and gave a moiety of this share to Miss Jane Mackenzie, her husband's sister, and the other to Mary Kirkby, who married Mr. Thomas Rob inson. In 1775, these parties joined in selling the moiety of the manor of Callow to the late Philip Gell, esq. and it is now the property of his son, Philip Gell, of Hopton, esq.

Stafford, is with respect to antiquity and connexions, one of the most eminent in the latter county. The present representative, Hugo Malveysin Chadwick, esq. is the fourteenth in descent from Nicho las de Chadwick, the seventeenth from De la Launde, the nineteenth from John de Healey, and the twenty-fifth from Malveysin, the Norman. The Malveysins of Ridware, after possessing estates in Staffordshire, ten descents from the Conquest, terminated in the male line by the death of Sir Robert Malveysin, who was slain at the battle of Shrewsbury, in 1403; his two co-heir esses, Margaret, the younger, espoused Sir William Hansacre, knt. and Elizabeth, the elder, Sir John Cawarden, knt. and after seven descents of the Cawaidens, Joyce, the third daughter of Thomas Cawarden, brought by marriage, a moiety of the manor of Malveysin Ridware to her husband, John Chadwick, esq. in the year 1594. Katherine, the granddaughter of this marriage, and daughter of Lewis Chadwick, esq. a lieutenant colonel of Horse in the Parliament army, at the battle of Stafford, &c. brought these estates to John Chadwick, esq. of Healey hall, who was also a lieutenant colonel in the Parliamentary army. His son, Charles Chadwick, who married into the family of the Sacheverells of Morley, was an earnest supporter of the cause of William III. who seems to have differed greatly in the politics of the period from his brother-in-law, George Sacheverell, of Callow, who, when he was sheriff of Derbyshire, in the year 1712, acknowledged the very doubtful relationship of the famous Dr. Henry Sacheverell,* and gave him half the * Tindal says that Dr. Henry Sacheverell was the grandson of John Sacheverell, Presbyterian minister, of Wincan ton, in Somersetshire, who was bred in St. John's college, Oxford, and silenced soon after the Restoration. This John, being taken at a conventicle, suffered three years imprisonment, which occasioned his death. John's eldest son, father of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, was bred in King's college, Cambridge, and entertained notions very opposite to his father's principles, and died minister of St. Peter's church, in Marlborough, leaving a numerous family, in very low circumstances. His son Henry was put to school at Marlborough, at the charge of Edward Hearst, an apothe cary, who, being his godfather, adopted him for his son. Hearst's widow sent him afterwards to Oxford, where he became Fellow of Maudlin college. His mother, by procurement of Bishop Burnet, was admitted into the hospital for distressed widows, at Salisbury. He had not been long at Oxford before he discovered his turbulent spirit. When he came to be ordained by Bishop Lloyd, he was by the Bishop charged with false Latin, but he confidently defended it, until the Bishop sent for books to convince him. The Bishop, finding him very ignorant in divinity, refused to ordain him at that time, but did it afterwards on the Bishop of Oxford's recommendation, with particular marks of favour ; yet he ungenerously traduced the learned prelate in a libel, called, \" The Character of a Low Churchman.\" Nor was he less virulent against Bishop Burnet, his mother's benefactor.

CALVER, a village, hamlet, and constabulary in the chapelry of Baslow, parish of Bakewell, Caluoure, anc] ;n the hundred of High Peak, is seated on the west bank of the Derwent, 2 m. N. of Baslow, and 1 m. S. of Stony Middleton, which is the post town. In 1821, this hamlet contained 115 houses, 121 families, and 604 inhabitants. Of the families, 27 were employed in agriculture, 36 in trade, and 57 in the cotton-mills and in the lime quarries. The cotton-mills are worked by Messrs. Mason and Co. who employ about 200 hands, and the extensive lime works at this place are carried on by Messrs. Broomhead and Frost. The township consists of 850 acres of limestone and gritstone land. The tithes belong to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, who lets them on lease to the Earl of Newburgh, who is sole proprietor and lord ofthe manor. The average rental is about 24*. per acre, and about Is. in the pound for tithe is added to the rental. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a3822. The average of nine years' poor and county rates, with the constables' accounts, is \u00a3108. 10.. Id. The parishioners pay church rates to Baslow and Bakewell. There is one male friendly society, consisting of 170, and one female, of 80 members ; one Sunday-school, supported by Mr. Mason and the parishioners, and one bridge across the Derwent, repaired at the expense of the county. Calver is a part of one of the principal limestone districts of Derbyshire, and it derives con siderable advantage from its proximity to lands where a different soil prevails, and its produce is in great demand. The lime obtained here is admirably suited for agricultural purposes ; hence a fordshire, he fell in, both there and at Oxford, with the most furious of the High Church and Jacobite party ; made scurrilous reflections on the death of King William and the Hanover succession, and, when the Queen appeared against the High Church Memorial, he called her a waxen queen, alluding to the jest passed upon her at Oxford by those who put her motto Semper Eadem upon a weather-cock. He was proceeding in this manner when his friends got him preferment in London."], [249, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 223 lucrative trade has been established, for the supply of which the hills of Calver furnish abundant materials. It is much to be regretted that no canal communication has been opened between this and other parts of the same county, where lime is wanted and coal abounds ; a mutual ex change of the productions of each would be highly advantageous to both. Great difficulty would certainly be found in thus passing the immense rampart of hill by which they are divided ; but, as a canal has been lately continued to Sheffield, it might easily be carried through Abbey Dale to East Moor, above Totley, and thence by Dronfield to Chesterfield. With the nearest part of this branch a rail-road, on the principle of the one near Chapel-en-le-Frith, might communicate. The practicability of this undertaking is easily discernible, and its utility would produce an in crease of business to the Sheffield and Chesterfield canals, that would be of incalculable benefit to both. The limestone rocks of Derbyshire not only furnish excellent manure for agricultural purposes, but, when untouched by fire, they produce the best materials in the kingdom for road-making. The persons employed here in this useful branch of labour are by no means deficient in a know ledge of their business ; on the contrary, they appear to understand the best principles of making and repairing roads. They break the limestone to a circular guage of from two and a half to three inches in diameter, and a forfeit is incurred for every stone that will not pass the ring: the stone when thus broken is laid upon the road six or eight inches thick, and shortly it becomes so hard and compact, that the carriage wheels as they pass over it scarcely leave a mark behind them. In the vicinity of Bakewell, Baslow, Calver, Hassop, and throughout the High Peak, this system of road-making has long prevailed, and has been found very beneficial; the roads are not only easy to travel on, but they are very durable, and made at little expense. The manor of Calver at the Doomsday Survey was a berewick to Ashford, and belonged to the king. In the reign of Henry VI. to Thomas Lynford. Henry VIII. granted it to Rowland Shakerley, and having passed to the Traceys, was conveyed by that family to the Stratfords.

W. from London, is seated in one of the most beautiful valleys in the Peak of Derbyshire, and more celebrated than any other for its extensive and wonderful cavern, ancient and once valuable lead mines, and Peverel's castle. The houses in the village are built princi pally of stone, procured in the neighbourhood at the foot of Mam Tor, and other immense moun tains that enclose it to the south and west : to the north and east a fruitful plain of some miles' extent is enclosed on the north by another range of hills, the highest eminences of which are known by the names of Winhill, Losehill, Bamford Edge, &c. The parish includes the parochial chapelry of Edale, which is seated in the most secluded part of Derbyshire, embosomed amidst the highest portion of the Peak hills. The township of Castleton, in 1821, contained 210houses, occupied by 214 families, and 993 persons, now increased to about 1200 inhabitants, who are em ployed in agriculture, the mines, cotton weaving, twine spinning, and other trades and handicraft. The support of the inhabitants is derived from these sources, and from those who are induced to visit the remarkable places in the neighbourhood. The extent of the township of Castleton is 2905 a. 3 r. 32 p. of good land, principally pasture, watered by a brook which springs from under a rock near the Peak cavern ; the land on the north side of the township is gritstone, and that on the south, limestone, divided into large farms, generally at an average rental of \u00a32. per acre, though there are many small proprietors, the number of freeholders being 150. Among the large proprietors may be enumerated the Duke of Devonshire, grantee and lessee of the manor under the crown, Sir William Chambers Bagshaw, M. D. W*illiam John Bagshaw, of the Oaks in Norton, esq. Rev. John Bagshaw, of Banner Cross, as lessee ofthe duchy, Isaac Hall, esq. John Champion, esq. Messrs.

The great tithes belong to the bishop of Chester, as rector, and the vicar in the following proportions, viz. two thirds to the bishop, and one-third to the vicar. The great tithes are on lease to the inhabitants at \u00a3135. 19.P. Id. The tithe of lead ore is every twentieth dish, and rarely exceeds \u00a360. per annum. The small tithes belong to the vicar. The estimated annual value ofthe buildings and land is \u00a32897. 19.. 2d. The average of seven years' parochial expenses (except the church rate, which is nearly one book annually, and the highways) is \u00a3288. 5s. The paupers are maintained in a workhouse. There is one Wesleyan Methodist chapel, built in 1S09; two male, and one female friendly societies, a parochial day-school, endowed, two Sunday-schools, one at the church and one at the Methodist chapel, which are supported by the voluntary contributions of the in habitants, and seven inns in the township.

The manor of Castleton is described in the Doomsday Survey as \" Terra Castclli William Peverell, in Peche fers.\" This expression, says Lysons, seems to import, that the castle which gives name to this parish, was built by William Peverel, natural son of William I. who had given him this manor amongst other estates after the Conquest. The Peverels did not enjoy their large estates in this county many generations ; for William Peverel, a grandson of the first possessor, having poisoned Ranulph, Earl of Chester, was obliged to secure his safety by an ignominious flight; leaving his castles and immense possessions at the king's (Henry the Second) disposal. Some of these continued many years in the crown, as appears by the sheriffs' accounts, but at length were granted by Henry II. to his son John, Earl of Morteyne, who afterwards succeeded to the crown. During the absence of Richard I. this castle, pursuant to the agreement between Longchamp, bishop of Ely, and John, Earl of Morteyne, was placed in the hands of Hugh de Novant.* In the sixth year of the reign of John, Hugh de Neville was appointed governor of the castle of Pec. It was afterwards in the hands ofthe rebellious barons, who united to oppose the tyranny of the monarch, but, in 1215, William de Ferrers, seventh Earl of Derby, raised troops for the king, and took it from them by assault; and, in recompense for this eminent ser vice, he was appointed governor. In the following year, Ranulph de Blunderville, Earl of Ches ter, was governor. The castellans now followed each other in quick succession. In 1 Henry III. William de Ferrers, seventh Earl of Derby, obtained a new patent for the custody of the castle of Pec, and held the government of it full six years. In 7 Henry III. the custody was given to Bryan de Lisle, a person of great trust with the king. In 13 Henry III. it was delivered up by \u2022 Hugh de Novant, or Nonant, was chaplain to Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury and archdeacon of Oxford. He was high sheriff for the county of Stafford, in 3, 4 and 5 Richard I. and for executing which office he was suspended from his Episcopal functions. Before his consecration, he was appointed by the Pope to the office of legate. In 11!!9, Richard I. granted to him liberty of all his manors, lands and men, and of all those of his churches of Coventry and Lichfield, Chester, Shrewsbury, &c. He purchased the monastery of Coventry of the same king for 300 marks, intending to place secular priests in it. In 1 190, he, for this purpose, went thither with armed men, and the monks refusing to obey his order, he effected his design by force of arms, wounding some and putting others to flight ; he burnt and destroyed their charters and evidences, and established secular priests in their place. Bale says that he himself was wounded in the conflict near the high altar. In 1193, he was robbed of valuable treasures near Canter bury, as he was travelling towards king Richard, then a prisoner in Germany. Soon after the king's return he was deprived of his bishopric, for joining in the conspiracy with John, Earl of Morteyne, afterwards king John, against his brother Richard, in his absence ; but he was willing to buy restitution, although he could never regain the king's favour, with the sum of 5,000 marks. During his episcopate he obtained for the church of Lichfield the advowson of Bakewell. In 1197, he was compelled, by the pope's mandate and the king's authority, to replace the monks of Coventry, though he yet entertained great aversion to them. Before his death he repented of his severity to the monks, and by large contributions endeavoured to expiate his offence, and dying in the habit of a monk, in 1199, at Betherleven, in Normandy, he was buried in the Monks' cloisters, at Caen. After the death of this bishop, the monks of Coventry having appointed a new prior, they proceeded to the election of a bishop."], [253, "227 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY.

Prince Edward ; and in 49 same reign, Simon de Montfort. In 18 Edward I. William, Earl Warren; 1 Edward II. Piers Gaveston; 4 Edward II. John, Earl of Warren, obtained a free grant of the castle and honour of Peke, in Derbyshire, with the whole forest of High Peke, to hold during his life in as full and ample a manner as it was anciently enjoyed by the Peverels before it came by escheat to the kings of England. In 2 Edward III. this castle and forest appear to have been a part of the fortune given with Joan, sister of Edward III. on her marriage with David, Prince of Scotland. In 46 Edward III. it was given to John of Gaunt, and consequently absorbed in the Duchy of Lancaster. Sir Ralph Shirley, who died in 1466, was constable of Peak castle. In the reign of Henry VII. the castle was held under the Duchy, by Robert Eyre, of Padley, esq. ; in that of Henry VIII. successively by Robert Thornhill and William Gallins. Leland calls it the \" Castel of the Hy Peke, belonging to the king.\" In the reign of Edward VI. it was held by Godfrey Somersall; and in that of Elizabeth, successively by John Eyre, esq. and Godfrey Foljambe, esq. The elevated situation of the castle, and the almost perv.endicular chasms that nearly isolate the eminence which it occupies, must, prior to the invention of gunpowder, have rendered it al most impregnable. The east and south sides are bounded by a narrow ravine, called the Cave, which ranges between two vast limestone rocks, and on the east is nearly 200 feet in depth. On the west it is skirted by the precipice which frowns over the great cavern, and rears its abrupt head to the height of 200 feet. The north side is the most accessible, yet even here the path has been carried in a winding direction, to obviate the steepness of the ascent. The castle yard, an enclosed area, extended almost over the whole summit of the eminence. The wall is nearly in ruins to the level of the area; though, in some few places on the outside, it measures twenty feet high. On the north side were two small towers, now destroyed. The entrance was at the north-east corner, as appears by part of an archway yet remaining. Near the north-west angle is the keep. The walls of this building, on the south and west sides, are pretty entire ; and at the north-west corner are 55 feet high ; but the north and east sides are much shattered. On the outside it forms a square of thirty-eight feet, two inches ; but on the inside it is not equal, being, from north to south, twenty-one feet, four inches; from east to west, nineteen feet, three inches. This difference arises from a difference in the thickness of the walls, which are composed of broken masses of limestone, and mortar of such an excellent temper, that it binds the whole together like a rock : the facings, both outside and inside, are of hewn grit stone. In the wall within is a little herring-bone ornament. The inside is a complete vacuity ; but anciently consisted of two rooms ; one ou the ground floor, and one above : over which the roof was raised with a gable end to the north and south, but not of equal height with the outer walls. The ground floor was about fourteen feet high, the upper room about sixteen. The entrance to the former appears to have been through a cToor way on the south side ofthe upper room, by a flight of steps, now wholly destroyed, but said to have existed within memory : the present entrance is through an opening made in the wall. At the south-east corner is a narrow winding staircase communicating with the roof, but in a ruinous condition. The antiquary will contemplate this ancient structure with feelings of gratification. The top ofthe rock where the castle stands is but a circumscribed plot of ground, nor can it at any time have been sufficiently ample to accommodate the numerous establishment of a great feudal chief tain : yet, in the earlier ages, it appears to have been a place of considerablejmportance ; and the occasional residence of the Peverels, who resided here in great pomp and splendour. The antiquity of this castle is considerable. Mr. King, who has minutely described it in the sixth volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia, imagines it to have been a fortress, and a place of royal resi dence, during the government of the Saxons ; but other antiquarians suppose it to be an undoubted Norman structure, built by William Peverel, natural son of the Conqueror ; to whom, indeed, the traditions of the neighbourhood ascribe its erection. Its ancient appellation of Peverel's Place"], [254, "228 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER in the Peke, countenances this opinion. Whatever is the truth, it is certain, that Peverel pos sessed it at the time of the Doomsday Survey, by the name of the Castle of the Peke, with the honour and forest, and thirteen other lordships in this county. About this time a tournament is reported to have been held here on the following occasion. \" Pain Peverel (half brother to William) Lord of Whittington, in the county of Salop, had two daughters ; one of whom, named Mellet, was no less distinguished by a martial spirit than her father. This appeared from the declaration she made respecting the choice of a husband. She firmly resolved to marry none but a knight of great prowess ; and her father, to confirm her pur pose, and to procure and encourage a number of visitors, invited all noble young men who were inclined to enter the lists, to meet at Peverel's Place in the Peke, and there decide their preten sions by the use of arms ; declaring, at the same time, that whoever vanquished his competitors, should receive his daughter, with his castle at Whittington, as a reward for his skill and valour. Guarine de Meez, a branch of the house of Lorraine, and an ancestor of the Lords Fitz-Warrine, hearing this report, repaired to the place above mentioned, and there engaged with a son of the king of Scotland, and also with a Baron of Burgoyne, and vanquishing them both, obtained the prize for which he fought.\" It has been observed that this castle, though almost impregnable from its situation, was but ill adapted for a procrastinated siege, there being no appearance of any well or reservoir within its walls, from which the garrison could be supplied with water. To this observation it has been replied, that the spring at the upper end of Cave Dale might, by some very simple contrivance, have been made available to furnish the troops with this necessary article. Another, and more ample supply, lies more conveniently ; a well has been discovered on the summit of Long Cliffe Hill ; between which, and the castle, there is a communication, though now a very dangerous one, across the narrow ridge of rock that overtops the entrance into Peak's Hole. This well is built ofthe same kind of stone as the castle, and it is so situate as easily to be made available for an abundant supply of water. The Duke of Devonshire has the nominal appointment of constable ofthe castle, and is lessee of the honour or manor and forest of the Peak, of which Castleton was, till of late years, esteemed a member. Courts are now held for Castleton as a distinct manor, extending over many of the townships of the Peak. The name of Peverel is closely identified with the ancient history of this county. One of the most celebrated possessors of that name was the natural son of William the Conqueror, by Maude, the daughter of Ingelric, a Saxon nobleman, related to Edward the Confessor. This lady, who possessed great personal beauty, appears, according to some historians, to have been the wife of Ranulph Peverel, Elderman of the hundred of Dengy, in the county of Essex, and resident at Hatfield Peverel, in that county. It is probable that she became the mistress of William of Nor mandy during his visit at the court of the Confessor, and that he gave her in marriage to his companion in arms, Ranulph Peverel, son of Payne Peverel, standard bearer to Robert, Duke of Normandy, the father of William I. The king's son, by Maude, at the desire of his mother, as sumed the name of his father-in-law, Peverel. According to the monk Vitalis, the newly built castle of Nottingham was committed to the custody of Peverel, in the second year of the reign of the Conqueror, but it is not stated which Peverel is meant ; and we find that Castellane, one of the sons of Maude, was living in Dover, and that another, named Payne, was Lord of Brun, in the county of Cambridge. There is no difficulty in the supposition that William Peverel, the natural son of the Conqueror, was advanced nearly to the age of manhood, at the period of his father's successful enterprise, and we accordingly find that immense possessions were bestowed upon him immediately after the Conquest. Blore, in his History of the manor of South Winfield, says \"he had in Nottingham forty-eight houses of merchants, twelve houses of knights, and thirty nine manors, with many dependent villages, in Nottinghamshire : forty-four lordships in Northamp tonshire, and two in Essex. He had one manor and a dependent village in Bedfordshire, two towns in Oxfordshire, eight manors and their dependencies in Buckinghamshire ; and besides"], [255, "229 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. this manor of Winfield, twelve manors and their villages in Derbyshire.\"* At the court of his half-brother, William Rufus, Peverel continued in favour, and, during the war with Robert of Normandy, the castle of Helme, in that duchy, was entrusted to him, which, however, he sur rendered upon its being closely besieged. He died shortly afterwards, probably in disgrace, and is said by Deering,t from the Records of Lenton, to have founded the priory at that place, for Cluniac monks. William Peverel (his son) in the time of Henry I. founded the priory of Lenton, near Not tingham, for Cluniac monks, and for the health ofthe souls of King William and Queen Matilda, and of their and his parents, and of King Henry and his Queen Matilda, and of their children, William and Matilda (the latter of whom first married to the Emperor, Henry IV. and afterwards to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Earl of Anjou, and by her last husband was mother of King Henry II.) and also for the health of his own soul, and for the souls of Adeline, his wife, his son William and all his (the founder's) children; he gave thereto the following munificent gift out of his Der byshire estate, viz. two parts of his demesne pastures in Buchestones (Buxton) Sachalcros (Shall cross) Ferneley (Fernilee) Sirebrock, Stafden (Staden) Cudal, probably (Cowdale) Crebil, Chal delow, Darnehal, Stauredorl (Sterndale) Dunningestede, and Chelmordon (Chelmorton). He also gave them his manor of Blacowell (Blackwell) in the Peak, and two parts of the tithes of Tideswell, Bradewell, Badecowell (Bakewell) Hoccalaw (Hucklow) Esseford (Ashford) Worm mill (Wormhill) Monyax (Monyash) and Hulme (Holme) together with the whole tithe of his lead and venison in the Peak. Avenellus, one of his men, ancestor of the Earl of Rutland, granted to the same out of his demesnes at Haddon and Mettred uc ploth, probably (meadow place) and Monyax (Monyash.) To which his knights and great tenants made considerable additions. He gave to the abbey of St. Mary, in York, founded by the Earl of Brittany, eight carucates of land in Rudsten ; he also founded an abbey of Black Monks, near Northampton, where, accord ing to the Abbey register, he died in 1113. William Peverel, according to the opinion of Blore, son of the last named William, was one of the temporal Lords who attended King Stephen in the great council held at Oxford, in the first year of his reign, in which the King granted his Charter of indulgences to the people and privi leges to the church ; and in the third year of King Stephen he conducted the Nottinghamshire forces into Yorkshire, against the Scots; and in that expedition, he, at the famous battle, fought near Northallerton, in Yorkshire, called Bellum de Standard, shared in the honour of a glorious vic tory, obtained by the English, under the command of William, Earl of Albemarle, in the com pany of Robert de Ferrers, then Earl of Ferrers, and afterwards created Earl of Derby. But in the sixth or seventh year of King Stephen (1440) he experienced a wide reverse of fortune; for, continuing firm in his attachment to the King, and the affairs of the Empress, who had then raised an army to assert her right to the crown, taking a favourable turn, Ralph Paganell, baron of Dudley, one of her adherents, set fire to the town of Nottingham : and this W*illiam Peverel, immediately afterwards, fighting stoutly at Lincoln, in the army of Stephen, against the army of the Empress, headed by Robert the Consul, Earl of Gloucester, he was there taken prisoner with the King, and the government of his castle at Nottingham was given, by the Empress, to the before named Ralph Paganell.:): But in the following year the soldiers of William Peverel by stratagem in the night recovered it again. * In the extract from the Doomsday Book, given in our Appendix, will be found particularized the manors in Der byshire held by William Peverel. The castle, in the Peak Forest, Derbyshire, is expressly mentioned at the head of them. f This author states that William I. in the second year of his reign, bestowed on his natural son the newly built castle of Nottingham, and large estates in that county. The Peerage of England places him at the head of the Earls of Nottingham, but Glover, in his Catalogue of Honour, makes no mention of him as such ; and Camden says Wil liam, surnamed the Conqueror, made his natural son ruler of the counties of Nottingham and Derby, by the title of Lord. Some of the minor courts of this and the adjoining county of Nottingham, are still known by his name. + Duo. Bar. Vol. I. p. 431, 437, and Speed, p. 473. I am aware this action, and all the other occurrences I have related respecting this family, except the donations to York abbey, are annexed by Dugdale to one and the same William Peverel. But besides that, the register of St. James, near Northampton, offers evidence (notwithstanding the disagreement between the year of our Lord and the King's reign) that William Peverel, the founder, whom, for"], [256, "230 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER King Stephen being at Nottingham, at the very earnest entreaty of this William Peverel (the third) and of Odona, his wife, and Henry, his son, confirmed to the monastery of Lenton what William Peverel, father of this William, or this William himself, or any other benefactors had given thereto. This William Peverel, it seems, had taken from the canons at Lenton the churches of H\u00e6cham and Randia, which had been given to them by William, his father : but afterwards repenting of what he had done, he, with the consent of his heir, William the younger, restored them. His Deed being attested by many witnesses, and, amongst others, by Robert de Heriz. His son William inherited the wealth and honours of the family, but was deprived of his estates by Henry II. His crime was the poisoning of Ranulph, Earl of Chester, with whose wife, the daughter ofthe Earl of Gloucester, he intrigued and confederated in the perpetration of this ne farious action, A. D. 1153. Dreading the just severity of the monarch, he fled, on his guilt be coming known, to the monastery of Lenton, founded by his grandfather, and took the cowl as a monk ; but it being intimated to him that the king intended to pass through Nottingham in his way to York, he threw off his religious habit and privately quitted the kingdom. The king seized upon the major part of his possessions, which he retained in his own hands until the birth of his youngest son, John, on whom he bestowed them, with the title of Earl of Morteyne. Margaret, the sister of the last William Peverel,* married Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Nottingham and Derby, whose pedigree will appear in our account of Duffield. Most of the Pedigrees we have consulted only give two generations of this family, but we think the account given by Blore is more consistent with truth than any other, and that his reasons are well grounded. The handsome tower church is dedicated to St. Edmund. In 1269, the church of Peak castle was given by Prince Edward (afterwards Edward I.) to the Abbot and Convent of Vale Royal, in Cheshire. After the dissolution, Henry VIII. gave the great tithes and the advowson of the vicarage, to the Bishop of Chester, and his successors. The Bishop of Chester has 85 a. 1 r. 15 p. of land in the township, 35 acres of which is but of little value, being high inferior land, and difficult to cultivate. Some small plots, containing 3 a. 3r. 4 p. are divided between the bishop, as rector, and the vicar. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at \u00a341. and yearly tenths ; it has been augmented by \u00a3200. subscribed, and \u00a3200. obtained from Queen Anne's Bounty. The glebe land is 2 1 a. 3 r. 1 7 p. ; the vicar also receives a third part of the great tithes, now let for \u00a3135. 19_. Id. yearly; and the tithe of lead ore, which averages about \u00a360. per an num, the mines being less productive than formerly. The Rev. Charles Cecil Bates is the present vicar. In 1819, the Rev. F. Farren left about 600 volumes of books to be lent out to the parishioners at the discretion of the minister. A handsome Saxon arch, which divides the nave and the chancel, was rebuilt, in 1827, by order of Mr. Elias Needham and Mr. Timms, churchwardens. Monumental Inscriptions in the Church.

And, indeed, I think it is evident it was not him, but his grandson, William Peverel the third, who fought for King Stephen.

Township of Castleton, The immediate approach to Castleton, by the road across the mountains from Chapel-en-le- Frith, is by \" a steep descent, called the Winnats,* or Wind-gates, from the stream of air that always sweeps through the chasms. This road is two miles in length, and carried on in a wind ing direction, in order to render the natural declivity of the ground passable by carriages. Happy was the imagination that first suggested its name, The gales or portals of the winds; since, wild as these sons of the tempests are, the massive rocks which nature here presents, seem to promise a barrier sufficiently strong to control their maddest fury. Precipices 1000 feet in height, dark, rugged and perpendicular, heave their unwieldy forms on each side the road, which makes several inflections in its descent, and frequently presenting themselves in front, threaten opposition to all further progress. At one of these sudden turns, to the left, a most beautiful view of Castleton vale is unexpectedly thrown upon the eye, refreshing it with a rich picture of beauty, fertility and variety, after the tedious uniformity of rude and barren scenery to which it has so long been confined.\" This peaceful and luxuriant vale has a very impressive effect, from being contrasted with the bleak and elevated tracts that environ it. Its breadth is in many parts two miles from south to north ; its length, eastward, between five and six ; and its depth, below the general level of the surrounding country, nearly 1000 feet. Through its bosom flows several meandering rivulets ; and from the north and south, various lesser dales open into it from different distances. 1 his valley communicates with that through which the Derwent holds its course to Derby, a track well worth pursuing, from the romantic variety and beauty of the scenes it successively presents. * \"The Winnats is not without a tale of horror. About sixty years ago a gentleman and lady, mounted on single horses and unattended with servants, are said to have been murdered in this dreary pass. They were strangers in the country, and some circumstances induced the supposition that they were on a matrimonial excursion to the north. They were both young, and one of the men concerned in the murder stated the lady to be extremely handsome. The morning after the commission of this atrocious act, the horses belonging to these unfortunate persons were found in the neighbourhood of Castleton, without riders, but properly caparisoned for travel. Suspicion pointed to the crime that had been committed, and an enquiry took place, when, after a few days' search, the dead bodies were found in one of the holes in the craggy sides of the Winnats. AU attempts to trace out the perpetrators of this horrid deed were for a long time fruitless : they escaped the punishment of an earthly tribunal, but a singularly calamitous fate attended them. They were five in number : one only died in his bed, who confessed to have participated in the crime, and as he was the last survivor, he told who were the companions of his guilt ; two of them, working near where the murder was committed, were killed by the sudden falling of a part of the rock above them ; the other two were the victims of different accidents, and the inhabitants of this district regard their premature deaths as awful instances of divine vengeance. Such is the tale of blood connected with the local history of the Winnats, and it is so circumstan tially related, that the names of the men who were concerned in the commission of the crime are mentioned, and the manner of their death particularly detailed. This story I have told as it exists in the vicinity of the place, but the enquiries I have made into the accuracy of the narrative induce me to suppose it fabulous.\" Bhodes.

The steep sides of the valley are beautified by well cultivated enclosures, rising above one another to its very edge. To the north, the country boldly swells into hills, terminating in two high points. Westward, it does not extend beyond the village of Castleton, but it there forms a noble amphitheatre, the back of which rises in many parts to the height of 1000 feet. As the road winds along the declivity, the traveller obtains a prospect of Castleton, which appears clus tered near the bottom of the steep eminence, at whose feet the famous cavern discloses itself, and whose summit is occupied by the ruins of the ancient castle, frowning over the precipice, and Mam Tor raising its head beyond, are striking and grand objects. Near the entrance of the vil lage, a bridge has been thrown across the stream which issues from the cavern. A ditch and vallum formerly extended in a semi-circular course round the village, from the mountain on which the castle stands, and may yet be traced in particular directions. Between one and two miles from Castleton, near the western extremity of the elevated ridge that separates this valley from Edale, is Mam Tor, or the Shivering Mountain, one of the seven wonders of the Peak. This eminence is composed of shale and micaceous grit in alternate strati fication ; the former being highly impregnated with vitriol of iron. Its name, Mam Tor, is an ancient British appellation ; but the Shivering Mountain is a title it has received in more modern times, from the circumstance of the shale continually decomposing under the action of the atmos phere, and falling in large quantities down the face of the precipice into the valley below. The vulgar error, that the mountain has suffered no diminution in bulk, though the shale and grit have been shivering from its face for ages, requires no confutation. If it did, the bare inspection of the spot would be sufficient ; as the valley below is overwhelmed with its ruins, to the extent of half a mile ; and the lines of an ancient encampment, which occupied the summit, destroyed fora num ber of yards by the crumbling ofthe substance. At some distance to the north-west, is another break in the mountain, called Little Mam Tor, from which the shale and grit frequently shiver, but not in so great a degree as at the former, where the rushing noise ofthe quantities that descends is sometimes so loud as to be heard at Castleton. The summit of Mam Tor was extremely well-adapted for a military station, as the ascent on every side, but the north-east, is very steep ; and the height of the mountain nearly 1300 feet above the level of the valley. The camp was surrounded by a double trench, which is still, for the most part, in excellent preservation. It extended from the north-east to the south-west, along the ridge of the eminence, and occupied somewhat more than sixteen acres of ground, the cir cumference being nearly 1200 yards. The enclosed area is very irregular, but approaches to the oblong form. The principal entrance was from the west. At the north-east corner is a perennial spring ; and near the south-west side are two barrows, one of which was opened a few years ago, and a brass celt, and some fragments of an unbaked urn, discovered in it. From the top of Mam Tor there is an extensive and charming view into Edale, which a modern tourist has described as. \"a place in which the inhabitants, secluded in the bosom of the moun tains from the bustle of the world, appear to enjoy all the quiet and security that pervaded the happy vale of Rasselas :\" the view from this eminence is not of common description : the most striking features of the Peak of Derbyshire \u2014 its loftiest hills, and some of its loveliest dales are included in the prospect. Near the bottom of Mam Tor, on the south, is the very ancient mine of Odin, which has proba bly been worked from the Saxon times, and still furnishes employment for nearly 140 persons men, women, and children. It consists of two levels, running horizontally into the mountain ; the upper, a cart-gate, by which the ore is brought from the mine ; the lower one, a water level, to drain the works, which have been carried more than a mile from the entrance. The vein of ore runs from east to west, hading, or underlying, to the south; and has in some places been fol lowed sixty yards below the horizontal entrance; and in others, as much above it : the thickness of the vein is various. The quality of the ore differs in different parts of the mine : the best kind"], [259, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 233 yields about three ounces of silver to the ton weight of lead. Elastic bitumen, blende, barytes, manganese, fluor spar, sulphuret of iron, and various other substances are obtained in this mine. Though the level at the entrance of Odin mine is not more than seven or eight feet from the surface of the earth, it is said to be nearly 450 feet below it, at the further extremity. It extends into the mountain where the blue John is found, that singular and beautiful substance, of which we have already given a description, as well as of the process observed in manufacturing it into ornaments, at page 77, in the first Part of this Work. The two mines in which it is procured, are named the Trecliff and the Water-hull. The entrance to the former is by an arched descent, con ducting by numerous steps to the depth of about sixty yards, where the steps terminate ; but a confined, yet tolerably easy path, leads into an opening about thirty yards deeper. This forms the commencement of a range of natural caverns, or fissures, in the bowels of the mountain, the termination of which is unknown, though they have been followed to an extent of nearly three miles. In this adventurous journey, the passage is in many parts extremely rude and difficult, the way being sometimes obstructed by enormous masses of stone, and at others impeded by pre cipitous gulfs, where the use of ropes becomes necessary to aid the descent. The strangely con fused situation of the fissures; the abrupt and dislocated appearance of the rocks which form them ; the singular direction of the path, now suddenly darting into the depths of the earth, and now proceeding by a more easy and circuitous route ; and the effect produced on the mind by this extraordinary arrangement of Nature's scenery ; are circumstances which description will ever be inadequate correctly to display. Some beautiful snow-white stalactite decorates several parts of these subterraneous passages ; and beds of a very rich kind of red ochre are found among the productions of this singular mountain. The blue John is obtained in two or three places of the mine, but does not appear to exist in any considerable quantity. The passage is in many places wet and slippery ; and the flannel shirt, hat, and trowsers, of a miner, are necessary to be worn by the person who undertakes to explore these remarkable cavities. The Speedwell Level, or Navigation Mine, another curious object for inspection in this neigh bourhood, is situate near the foot of the Winnats, in the mountainous range called the Long Cliff. This level was originally driven in search of lead ore, by a company of adventurers from Stafford shire, who commenced their undertaking about fifty-five years ago, but with such little success, that, after an expenditure of \u00a3l 4,000. and eleven years' ceaseless labour, exerted in vain, the works were obliged to be abandoned. The descent is beneath an arched vault, by a flight of one hundred and six steps, which leads to the sough, or level, where a boat is ready for the reception of the visitor, who is impelled along the stream by the motion communicated to the boat by the guide, through pushing against wooden pegs driven into the sides of the rock at the distance of six feet from each other. The depth of the water is about three feet : the channel through which it pro ceeds was blasted through the heart of the rock, which was found of such solidity and hardness, that implements of sufficient temper could hardly be procured to penetrate it. As the boat pro ceeds, several veins of lead ore may be observed in the rock, but of insufficient value to defray the expense of working them. At the distance of six hundred and fifty yards from the entrance, the level bursts into a tre mendous gulf, whose roof and bottom are completely invisible ; but across which the navigation has been carried, by throwing a strong arch over a part of the fissure where the rocks are least separated. Here, leaving the boat, and ascending a stage erected above the level, the attention of the visitor is directed to the dark recesses of the abyss beneath his feet ; and firm, indeed, must be his resolution, if he can contemplate its depths unmoved, or hear them described, with out an involuntary shudder. To the depth of ninety feet all is vacuity and gloom ; but beyond that commences a pool of stygian waters, not unaptly named the Bottomless Pit ; whose pro digious range may in some measure be conceived, from the circumstance of its having swallowed up more than 40,000 tons of the rubbish made in blasting the rock, without any apparent diminu tion either in its depth or extent. The guide, indeed, informs you, that the former has not been ascertained ; yet we have reason to believe that this is incorrect, and that its actual depth in standing water is about 320 feet. There cannot, however, be a doubt, but that this abyss has Hh"], [260, "234 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER communications with others, still more deeply situate in the bowels of the mountain, and into which the precipitated rubbish has found a passage. The superfluous water of the level falls through a water-grate into this profound caldron, with a noise like a rushing torrent. This fissure is calculated at being nearly 280 yards below the surface of the mountain ; and so great is its reach upwards, that rockets of sufficient strength to ascend 450 feet, have been fired without rendering the roof visible. The effect of a Bengal light discharged in this stupendous cavity, is extremely magnificent and interesting. Beyond the fissure, the level has been driven to a similar length to that part which precedes it ; but in this division of its course little occurs to excite observation. About half a mile from the entrance ofthe Cave- valley is a stratum of basalt, which appears at the surface, and, in one part, assumes somewhat ofthe form of an hexagonal column, and is simi- lar, in texture and hardness, to those of Staffa, in the Hebrides, and of the Giant's Causeway, in Ireland. Incorporated in it is crystallized quartz, approaching in appearance to chalcedony. This column is part of a vast basaltic mass of great thickness and considerable dip, which ranges north and south for fifty or sixty yards, and is covered with a thin stratum of a substance re sembling half baked clay. In its immediate neighbourhood is a stratum of toadstone ; some of which is decomposed, and appears like indurated clay, full of holes, and variegated with green spots, and calcarious spar : other specimens are extremely hard, with zeolite and jasper occasion ally occurring in them. The late Mr. Mawe, in the preface to his \" Mineralogy of Derbyshire,\" observes, \" that for the purpose of obtaining mineralogical information, Castleton seems to be the best situation, where such a variety of strata, mines, and minerals occur, as perhaps no situation in this kingdom can boast.\" \" The various mines and veins of ore,\" he adds, \"are ofthe first consequence, while the mountains around present a variety of strata worthy the attention of the geologist.\" CATTON, a village, township, constabulary and chapelry, in the parish of Croxall and hun- Chetune, dred of Repton and Gresley, 1 m.

This manor was possessed by the baronial family of Ferrers ; after the fall of that family, it appears to have been somewhat divided, for we find in 25 Edward I. William de Chaddesden, Henry de Cordville, and Anthony Luttrell held lands here. In 3 Edward II. Ralph Pipard died, and left his son John an estate here and at Spondon, which his father had held in 1 Edward I. In 29 Edward III. Nicholas de Chaddesden, clerk, Geoffrey de Chaddesden and William de Duf field, gave an estate here towards maintaining three chaplains in the church of Chaddesden. In 37 of same reign, and in 4 Richard II. Godfrey Foljambe left an estate hereto his granddaughter Alice. In 15 Richard II. Henry Cotton gave lands to the priory of Breadsall. In 12 Henry IV. William Sallow, of Stanton, died, and left his son John an estate under Sir John Fitz William. The Abbot of Darley also owned lands in this township. In 3 Edward IV. Agnes Marmion left her niece, Alice, wife of Thomas Pilkington, an estate here. In 1480, Sir William Plumpton died seised of the manor, by inheritance from Sir Robert Grene, and devised it to his granddaughters, Elizabeth, wife of John Sothill, and Margaret, wife of John Rocliffe ; from the latter the manor descended to the family of Clifford, and was sold by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, to Francis Curzon. In 7 Henry VII. Ralph Pole of Radbourn died, and left an estate here to George, son of John, son of Ralph, his cousin and heir at law. In 4 Henry VIII. John Curzon, of Kedleston, esq. died, and left his estate here to his son Richard. In 10 of the same reign, Thomas Babington died, and left his estate here to his son Anthony. In 31 of the same reign, Ralph Sacheverell left his son an estate here, under Richard Curzon. In 2 Edward VI. John Curzon left an estate here and at Spondon to his son Francis.

In 1 Elizabeth, John Bird, of Locko, left his son William his estate here and at Spondon. John, son of George Dethick, before-mentioned, died and left an estate here to his daughter,"], [263, "237 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. Dorothy, the wife of Sir John Harpur, of Swarkstone. In 27 Elizabeth, Henry Beaumont, of Normanton, esq. left his son Francis an estate here. In 35 of the same reign, Robert Newton, esq. had a considerable estate here, part of which had been bought of Francis Curzon and German Pole, esqrs. John Sacheverel, in the same year, left his son Henry an estate at Derby and Chad desden, which descended to his son John. In 42 Elizabeth, John Drew, of Derby, gent, had an estate here under Robert Newton, which he left to his son John. A family ofthe name of Lave rock formerly resided at Chaddesden, of whom John married Agnes, daughter and heiress of Ed mund Powtrell. The manor has long been united to that of Locko, and is now the property of Mrs. Lowe, of Locko hall. Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. is the principal landed proprietor, whose ancestors have resided here many generations. The church is an ancient structure, with a square embattled tower, dedicated to St. Mary. It was built before the time of Edward III.; for early in this reign a grant of one messuage and thirteen acres of land was made to three chaplains in the church at Chaddesden : most probably the warden and two chaplains of the chantry, founded in this church by Henry de Chaddesden, archdeacon of Leicester. Certain lands were conveyed, as the endowment of this chantry, by his executors, Sir Geoffery and Sir Nicholas de Chaddesden, in 1362. Besides the original endow ment, two messuages, one toft and sixty acres of land, were given to the chanters at the altar of the Virgin Mary, at Chaddesden, in 1380. Robert Newton, esq. beforementioned, died seised of the chantry, in Chaddesden, in 1593. In the south side ofthe chancel are two stone stalls. The skreen that divides the nave and the chancel is of oak, richly carved, after the gothic order. The living is a vicarage, stated in the king's books to be of the clear value of \u00a322. The benefice de rived from 23 a. 2r. 3 p. of glebe land, &c. is but small. Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. is the patron, and the Rev. Richard Coke Wilmot is the present incumbent.

Robert Wilmot, esq. by Deed, bearing date l6th April, 1737, granted for ever to the town of Chaddesden, a piece of land, in order that a school-house might be erected thereon. Adjoining the school are six almshouses, founded in 1634, by Edward Wilmot, D. D. for six poor people. Robert Wilmot, esq. by his Will, in 1 638, directed that his eldest son, Robert, and his heirs, should, out of lands at Chaddesden, thereby given to him, pay to four men and two women, to be placed in the almshouses at Chaddesden, Is. a piece weekly, a gown at Christmas, yearly, or 10.. in lieu thereof, three yards of linen cloth, at Is. per yard, and a dinner or 8d. in lieu thereof; to each of the poor men, once in two years, a cap, of the price of about 2s. and should repair the said almshouses as often as need be.

The family of Wilmot have sprung from the Saxon possessors of lands in Nottinghamshire, Sussex and Essex. A thane, of the name of Willimot, is mentioned by Speed as being attached to the court of king Ethelred. This nobleman held estates in Sussex in the tenth century ; and, in the next century, we find an illustrious family, named Wyllimot, resident at Sutton-upon-Soar, in the county of Nottingham. There are Deeds in the Wilmot family which were made in times before the custom of dating those documents was introduced. The Wilmots, or Wyllimots, of Derbyshire, settled at Derby or its immediate neighbourhood in the year 1539, in the person of Robert Wyllimot; whose son Robert married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Smith, of Spondon, and possessed property in Spondon and Derby. We refer our readers to the table of lineage for the descent and alliances which have branched out into families headed by three baronetcies ; the elder of which is the family possessing the estate and residence of Chaddesden ; the mansion was rebuilt about a hundred and thirty years ago, by Robert, the father of the first baronet, Sir Ed ward Wilmot, of Chaddesden. This eminent man was Physician General to the army, and Phy sician in Ordinary to the Royal family during the reign of George II. and the early part of the"], [266, "240 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER reign of George III. ; and for his professional services, he was created a baronet in the year 1759. \u2014 He died in the ninety-third year of his age, on the 21st of November, 1786. \u2014 Sir Robert Wil mot, the grandson of this eminent physician, was high sheriff of the county in 1803, and, from the enrolment to the disbanding of the Derbyshire Yeomanry Cavalry, he discharged the duties of Lieutenant-Colonel, with high satisfaction to the gentlemen composing that important loyal corps, and with reputation to himself. \u2014 His second, but eldest surviving son, resides at Chaddes den, and is an active Justice of the Peace for the county. The genealogical table of this family, which has flourished with high repute in this county during three centuries, will more distinctly point out the eminent individuals who have distinguished themselves in the senate, the church, the law, and in the medical profession. Two other branches of this family have obtained the dignity of baronet : Sir Robert Wilmot, of the junior branch, father of Sir John Eardley Wilmot, the Judge, was created in 1772 ; and Sir John Eardley Eardley Wilmot, grandson of the Judge, was created in 1821. These will be noticed under their respective residences. Chaddesden hall stands on a little elevation, south of the village church ; it is a good square mansion, built of brick upwards of a century ago, by Robert Wilmot, esq. The grounds around it are of the richest verdure, and well studded with plantations and ornamental timber. It is oc cupied by Henry Sacheverell Wilmot, esq. eldest son of Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. who has orna mented the hall with a good collection of preserved birds, of the most rare kinds and beautiful plumage. Chanderhill, in Brampton. CHAPEL-EN-LE-FRITH is a market-town, township, constabulary and extensive parish, Chapel-in-the-Forest, seated in a deep valley, on the road between Manchester and Sheffield, completely surrounded by barren and lofty mountains, called South Head, Cobwin and Paisley 's Coombs Moss, Chinley Churn, Eccles Pike, &c. in the archdeaconry of Derby and in the hundred of High Peak. This town is pleasantly situate, being built on a rising ground ; the houses are chiefly grit stone, of which the surrounding hills are composed. The Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester coaches pass through the town daily. It is 18 m. S. E. from Manchester; 40 m. N. N. W. from Derby ; 20 m. S. W. from Sheffield ; 24 m. N. W. from Chesterfield ; 6 m. N. of Buxton ; 7 m. N. of Tideswell ; 14 m. N. of Bakewell ; and 166 m. N. N. W. from London. Its name signifies the chapel in the Forest, from which the Saxon -word frith, a forest or wood. This parish contains four townships, of which the following form the enumeration, with the returns of the number of inhabitants in 1801, 1811, and 1821, and the estimated annual rental of all the lands, mes suages, and other buildings, in each township. Of the 1348 families, 194 were then chiefly employed in agriculture, 4Ssi in trade or handicraft, and 6(i8 in collieries, lime-works, stone-quarries, on the Peak Forest canal, and in professional pursuits. The manufactories of the neighbourhood are cotton-spinning, weaving calicoes, checks and ginghams, paper-making, &c. A power-loom mill has lately been erected by Messrs. Ash ton at Hyde. The extensive paper mills at Whitehough belong to Mr. Ibbottson, who has put up expensive machines, from which he has produced a sheet of paper 1000 feet long by 7 feet wide.

The extent of the parish of Chapel-en-le-Frith is upwards of 8000 acres of gritstone land, well watered by Randle Car-brook, Black-brook and numerous springs. It is bounded W. by Fernilee and Whaley in Cheshire ; N. by Chinley, Bugsworth and Brownside ; E. by Edale and Peak Forest ; and S. by Wormhill and Fairfield. The high land, which here prevails, lies bleak and cold, but in the vales it is good corn and pasture land. The average rental may be stated at 20.. per acre. The land is chiefly grazed, except about 30 acres of plantations and 100 acres of wastes or commons. The tithes are fixed by a modus, at \u00a3\\3. per annum, viz. two-thirds to the lord of the manor, and one-third to the minister. The parochial expenses have averaged about \u00a3 1 000. per annum during the last seven years (excepting the highway rate, which is col- lected separately) viz. the poor and county-rate, constables' accounts and salaries \u00a3910. and church- rate about \u00a3100. The parishioners subscribe to Newton in Cheshire House of Industry, where the paupers are sent, at a cost of 2s. each, weekly. The pauper-children are apprenticed to farmers and tradesmen. The land is divided among 80 resident freeholders above \u00a310. and 40 under \u00a310. per annum, and many non-resident.

By virtue of a commission, ad quod damnum, dated at York, the 28th of September, 1317, it is presented, that the Chapel in the Frith was built upon the king's soil, by the inhabitants there dwelling, in the time of Henry III. and was consecrated by Alexander de Savensby, the 45th bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, between the years 1224 and 1238. The east end was lengthened some years ago, by Mrs. Bower, whose daughter bequeathed her harp sichord, and \u00a320. per annum for a person to play, and to find coals to air the church. The living is a donative and a peculiar to the Deanery and Chapter of Lichfield, and is entered in the king's books ofthe clear value of \u00a3l6. l6_. 8d. In 171 9, Thomas Bagshaw, esq. gave lands, then let for \u00a320. a year, now more than treble that sum, to the minister of Chapel-en-le-Frith, for whom a house was built by subscription, in 1721. The living has been augmented by \u00a3500. from Queen Anne's bounty, and a parliamentary grant of \u00a3200. The present value of the living is about \u00a3200 per annum ; the freeholders are the patrons, and the Rev. Samuel Grundy is the present minister. The church has been recently re-pewed, and the church-yard greatly enlarged. In the parish register is an entry, which records the preservation of a girl of thirteen years of age, after having been exposed, without food, to the severity of the weather for six days.* ' \" On March 13, 1718-17, one Ph\u0153nix, a girl about thirteen years of age, a parish apprentice with William Ward, of Peak Forest, went from George Bowden's house, of Lane-side, about five of the clock in the morning, towards her master's house ; sat down upon George Bowden's part, on Peaslow, between two rutts, and staid that day, and the next, and the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday following, two of which days, viz. the 15th and 16th, were the most se vere for snowing and driving that hath been seen in the memory of man, and was found alive on the Monday, about one of the clock, by William Jackson, of Sparrow Pitt, and William Longden, of Peak Forest, and after a slender refreshment, of a little hot milk, was carried to her master's house ; and is now (March 25, 1717) very well, only a little stiffness in her limbs. This was the Lord's doing, and will be marvellous in future generations. She eat no meat during the six days, nor was hungry, but very thirsty, and slept much."], [269, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 243 Charities. SCHOOL. \u2014 Mary Dixon, by her Will, bearing date 6th August, 1696, devised a house and 17 a. lr. 20 p. of arable and pasture land, besides 5 or 6 acres described as brow, wood and clough land, and unproductive. This land is now let for \u00a318. per annum, of which sum \u00a316. is paid to the schoolmaster and \u00a32. to the poor. Robert Kirk gave a piece of land, which now lets for \u00a32. 10s. per annum to the schoolmaster, to teach three poor children; and John Marchington, by his Will, bearing date 20th November, 1 630, left a rent-charge of 20*. per annum to the schoolmaster. In respect of the two first donations above named, nineteen children are taught free. Richard Kirk, esq. who now resides in Wales, is supposed to be the only Trustee under Mrs. Dixon's Will. BOWDEN HEAD SCHOOL. \u2014 There is a small dwelling house and garden in the village of Bowden Head, in this parish, now occupied by a schoolmistress, rent free. The house is stated to have been built by subscription, for the residence of a schoolmaster or schoolmistress, about fifty years ago. The endowment for the support of the school kept on these premises is derived from the gift of Mary Bagshaw, who gave \u00a3100. and John Frith, who gave \u00a320. to the school- master, the interest of which is now \u00a35. per annum. For this payment the schoolmistress in- structs fourteen children, appointed from the neighbouring parts of the parish. There was formerly a Presbyterian meeting-house at Chapel-en-le-Frith, of which James Clegg, who published the Life of the Rev. John Aslie, was minister. There is now a meeting-house of the Wesleyan Methodists at Chapel-Town-end. Bank hall was the residence ofthe late Samuel Frith, esq. High Sheriff for the county in 1781, and a Justice of the Peace, who died at an advanced age, in 1828 ; and is now the estate of his brother, John Frith, esq.

Among their members have been found persons eminent for their rank and talents. We find in the Biographical Dictionary a mention of Edward Bagshaw, stated to have been a gentleman of Derbyshire, bred to the law, who, having first taken part with the Parliament, sided with King Charles I. and died in 1662, treasurer of the Middle Temple. He was the author of various political, legal, and religious works. Of his two sons, the elder, Edward, was a violent non-conformist and the author of many works of controversy : the younger, Henry, was a Prebendary of Durham, in 1 709- He wrote the \" Diatrib\u00e6, or discourses upon select texts against Papists and Socinians,\" and numerous single sermons. \u2014 In the regular lineage we find William Bagshaw, who was called the Apostle of the Peak, of Ford and Litton. He was minister of Glossop, but was ejected for his non-conformity, and died in 1 702, leaving, it is said, fifty volumes on different subjects, fairly written with his own hand. Of this gentleman we have a full account from the pen of his nephew, Mr. John Ashe, to which few particulars are to be added. Mr. Bagshaw was born at Litton, in the parish of Tideswell. His father, of the same name, had much improved a small inheritance by success in the lead-mines. From his early youth he was attached to religious studies, and opposed successfully the views of his family, who sought to divert his mind to some other pursuit. After a suitable education at different grammar-schools, he was sent to Cambridge, and being admitted of Corpus-Christi college, was under the care of Mr. Boise. His first public labours were at Wormhill, a chapel in his native parish. He had been there but one quarter of a year when a scene of wider usefulness opened upon him. Though only in his twenty-first year, he was chosen one of the assistant ministers of Sheffield, and appointed to the curacy of Attercliffe. He was also domestic chaplain to Colonel John Bright, afterwards Sir John, and consequently, we may presume, resided in the hall at Carbrook. On New Year's Day, 1651, he was ordained at Chesterfield, after the Presbyterian manner; Immanuel Bourne, rector of Ashover, being moderator on the occasion. His orthodox Confession of Faith was afterwards published, with a Sermon of Mr. Bagshaw's * on Christ's Purchase,' dedicated to his friends, Mrs. Jane Jessopp and Mrs. Elizabeth South, her sister, then living at Broom hall. Early in 1 652, Mr. Bagshaw resigned his connexion with the church of Sheffield. He settled at Glossop, ' the remotest corner of his native county,' where he laboured most assiduously in the ministry, amongst a rude but attached and grateful people. A connexion mutually acceptable was dissolved by the provisions of the Act of Uniformity. Tears testified his people's gratitude and esteem. He had an estate at Ford, in the parish of Chapel-en-le-Frith. To this place he retired, exer cising his ministerial functions whenever opportunity was afforded him. When some indulgence was granted to the non conformists, in 1672, he preached more publicly; and in the uncertain and dangerous times which succeeded, as well as in the more prosperous days after the Revolution, he was most assiduous in what he conceived to be the duty to which the providence of God had appointed him ; and so assiduous were his labours in instructing the people in his own neigh bourhood that he obtained the appellation of ' the Apostle of the Peak.' Various societies of Dis senters in the wilder parts of Derbyshire still exist, which were first collected by Mr. Bagshaw. His last public sermon was on the death of King William. The next Sunday he was confined to his bed. To a friend who lamented that he saw him unable to address his friends as usual on that day, he observed, ' My silence is a sermon :' and when another expressed his regret that Mr. Bagshaw could not even converse with them at any length, he said emphatically, ' I have spoken to you before.' There are many interesting particulars of Mr. Bagshaw's useful life and peaceful death in the work before quoted ; and also of his manner of conducting public services, in which was some thing peculiar. A list of his works may also be found, too long to be here transcribed. Popular in their day, they are now forgotten. They are chiefly pieces of practical divinity, and the fame ofthe practical divine, like that of the physician, can hardly be expected to outlive its century."], [272, "246 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Of all his works, probably, the only one now enquired after is his little tract ' De Spirilualibus Pecci,' which contains a brief account of several clergymen and other pious persons), his friends, delivered in a simple, natural, and interesting manner. His brother, John Bagshaw, of Litton and Great Hucklow, esq. was High Sheriff for the county of Derby in 1696. Adam, his third brother, was grandfather of Ellena, who married William Chambers, of Hull, M. D. ancestor of Sir William Chambers Bagshaw, of Wormhill. The great grandson of the celebrated divine was Colonel of the 93rd regiment, and Member of the Irish Parliament, for Waterford. The present representative of this (the elder) branch of the family, is the Rev. William Bagshaw, of Banner Cross, near Sheffield, perpetual curate of Wormhill, who married Ann, daughter of Samuel Foxlowe, of Staveley, esq. and sister and heiress of General Murray, of Banner Cross, in Eccleshall, co. York, and widow of Dr. Bedford, of Chesterfield, and has surviving, one daughter, married to Henry Marwood Greaves, of Hesley, esq.

We find John Gisborne, Mayor of this borough in 1659, from whom the present Rev. Thomas Gisborne, of Yoxall Lodge (a divine, eminent for his poetic and prose works) is the fourth in descent. The branches of this family are numerous and highly respected. We find among them General James Gisborne, a gentleman of distinguished talent, and the late President of the College of Physicians, Thomas Gisborne, M. D. who died at Romeley hall, early in the present century. The Rev. Francis Gisborne, elder brother of the Physician, was, during sixty years, rector of Staveley. He died in 1821, at the age of 89, unmarried; and left his property, to the amount of \u00a360,000. to charitable uses. In his lifetime he transferred \u00a31 6,1 67- 13s. id. in the 3 per cent. Consols, to Trustees, the dividends to be appropriated to the purchasing of coarse Yorkshire cloth or flannel, for the use and benefit ofthe poor in one hundred parishes or chapel ries in Derbyshire. \u2014 After certain bequests in his Will, he directed the residue of his property to be divided into three equal parts : one part to the Derby Infirmary, another to the Sheffield In firmary ; and the third portion to be incorporated with the sum invested in the 3 per cents, for purchasing coarse cloth, &c. for the use of the poor in the one hundred parishes previously designated. \u2014 The younger brother of the same branch was General of the army, Member of the Irish Parliament, and Governor of Charlemont. Thomas Gisborne, esq. the uncle of these gentle men, was five times Mayor of the borough of Derby, and many years a Justice of the Peace. His brother, John Gisborne, esq. was twice Mayor of the borough, and also a Justice of the Peace. Horridge house is the seat of Walter Gisborne, esq. Bowden hall, another remnant of antiquity within this parish, formerly belonged to an ancient and wealthy family of that name, who, as tradition reports, gave to the parish of Chapel-en-le- Frith, the present chancel part of the church, formerly used as a Roman Catholic chapel. This report seems to be confirmed, by the parish being called Bowden Chapel to this day, and b}- the derivation of the name of the town, which probably was so called from this ancient chapel, and the great number of trees which surrounded it : for there is also a tradition that a squirrel could run from Coombs Head to Chinley Head, in which direction the chapel lay, without touching the ground.

We are not aware of the lineage which traces a con nexion hetween this family and that of the poet Milton. Godwin, in his History of the Commonwealth, thus speaks of the President: \" An individual, who was rising into eminence at this time was John Bradshaw, the kinsman of Milton. He was bred to the profession of the law, and his eloquence is praised by Lilburn. Milton, who seems to have known him thoroughly, speaks of him in the highest terms; as at once a professed lawyer, and an admirable speaker ; an uncorrupt patriot, a man of firm and intrepid cast of temper, a pleasant companion, most hospitable to his friends, most generous to all who were in need, most peaceable to such as repented of their errors. He appears to have been in great practice as a pleader.

The subordinate or nominal manor of Blackbrook, consists of several estates or small parcels of land, which lie in many different villages in this and the adjoining parish of Glossop. It formerly belonged to the family of Leigh. The magistrates hold their petty sessions once a fortnight. The Duke of Devonshire, as lessee of the manor, under the duchy of Lancaster, holds a Court Leet and Court Baron, and a three weeks' court, for the recovery of small debts and damages, not exceeding \u00a35. Chapel Milltown, in Chapel-en-le-Frith. CHARLESWORTH, a village and hamlet in the parish of Glossop and hundred of High Peak, contained, in 1821, l6l houses, 164 families, and 1005 inhabitants. This village lies about 3 m. S. W. of Glossop, and 5 m. N. of Hayfield. The houses are built on the acclivity of Charles worth rock, a name given to the highest ridge of hills in this part of Derbyshire, extending south east to a considerable distance, being a continuation of freestone and gritstone rocks. This long straggling village has increased rapidly, both in buildings and population, within these few years, owing to the spreading of the cotton business, which gives employment to many of the inhabi tants. About one mile to the south are the collieries, which supply the numerous cotton-mills and villages in the neighbourhood. There are eight cotton-mills, one linen-thread-mill, and the extensive print works of Messrs. Matley and Co. in the immediate neighbourhood ; the latter is on the Cheshire side of the river Goyte. This place had formerly a market on Wednesdays, and a fair at the festival of St. Mary Mag dalen, granted, in 1328, to the Abbot of Basingwerk. That monastery acquired considerable landed property in Charlesworth, Chunall and Simondley, in the years 1307 and 1308. There is now a cattle fair held here on the 25th of April. The extent of the township is 1474 a. 2 r. 18 p. of gritstone and coal land, belonging to the Duke of Norfolk, except 24 a. 0 r. 1 p. : about one-tenth is arable, the remainder is meadow and pasture. The estimated annual value of the buildings and land is returned with Glossop, and the poor rates, &c. are collected by the overseer of Glossop. The average rental ofthe land is about 15_. per acre. Half the small tithes belong to the duke, and half to the vicar. The chapel at this place belonged formerly to the establishment; and in the Liber Regis it is described as a chapel of ease to Glossop : but more than a century ago it was, by permission of the Howard family, in the hands of the Presbyterians. In 1716) Mr. John Bennet left the in terest of \u00a320. for the benefit of the Presbyterian minister at Charlesworth. The chapel has lately been rebuilt, and it now belongs to the Independents. For Charities, see Glossop. CHATSWORTH is an extra-parochial hamlet in the parish of Edensor, in the hundred of Chetesvorde, High Peak, 2 m. S. of Baslow, 2 m. N. E. of Rowsley, 3| m. S.

D. B. 295. At the time ofthe Norman Survey, the manor of Chatsworth belonged to the crown ; and was placed under the custody of William de Peverel. It was for many generations the property of a family named Leche or Leech ; one of whom, named John, was chirurgeon, or, as a medical at tendant was termed, at that period, Leech to the king, in the reign of Edward III. From this John Leech descended Sir Roger Leech, of Beaurepoir or Belper, who was Lord High Treasurer of England in the time of Henry V. The brother of Sir Roger was Sir Philip Leech, who was treasurer of the wars of France. This distinguished knight was appointed to maintain a military"], [277, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 251 post at the siege of Rouen. He was also governor of Monceux and Newcastle, and was sent by the king on a commission with the Earl Marshal to the province of Maine. Raulf Leech was a captain in the van-guard of the king's army, which entered France the l6th of June, 1513 ; and Roger Leech was his pety captain. The male branch of this family became extinct about the middle of the sixteenth century ; but previous to that occurrence, the manor of Chatsworth had been sold, by Francis Leech or Leche, who had espoused the sister of the Countess of Shrews bury, to the family of Agard, of whom it was purchased by Sir William Cavendish. The extra-parochial hamlet of Chatsworth chiefly consists of the park, and comprises 1 280 a. 1 r. including about 420 a. of wood. The park is stocked with Spanish and South-down sheep, cattle, and nearly 2000 fallow and brown deer. In the summer and autumn months ley cattle are taken into the park, at 2s. per head weekly. The circumference of the park is nearly eleven miles, and it is beautifully diversified with hill and dale, wood and water. Extensive plantations range in masses over the inequalities of the ground. The noble river winds with a serpentine course through the valley. Descending from the lodge at Edensor inn, the mansion appears to great advantage, amid a noble amphitheatre of wood. The foliage near the house is connected with the remote hills by a succession of forest scenery, until it terminates in the rude and barren mountains of the Peak. Many delightful views occur from various points, almost all of which terminate in the surrounding moorland scenery. We copy the following exquisite sketch from Rhodes's Peak Scenery. \" Immediately before us lay the river, across whose stream a stone butment or wear has been erected, which damming up the water, expands it into breadth ; it is thence precipitated over this interruption to its progress, where it forms a magnificent cascade. On a gently ascending ground, about half a mile higher up the river, stands Chatsworth, finely embosomed in ' Majestic woods, of every vigorous green ; ' Stage above stage, high waving o'er the hills.' Thompson. \" A little on the left is the bridge, backed with broad and ample foliage : cattle reposing in groups on the brink of the river, or cooling themselves in the stream, adorned the foreground ; and the middle and remote distances, which are ornamented with a palace, a bridge, and towers and temples, disclose a scene as rich and as lovely as the fancy of Claude Lorraine ever portrayed when under the influence of his happiest inspirations. Yet the foreground had more of Berghem than Claude about it : the respective features which constitute the peculiar charm and excellence of these great masters, were most harmoniously combined ; every part was in character, and the whole was faithful to nature.\" The following Sonnet, from the pen of Clio Rickman, 'written at Chatsworth, on an evening in October, may be introduced in this place. I always lov'd thee, and thy yellow garb, October dear ! and I have hailed thy reign On many a lovely, many a distant plain, But here, thou claim'st my warmest, best regard. Not e'en the noble banks of silver Seine Can rival Derwent's \u2014 where proud Chatsworth tow'rs Reflect Sol's setting rays \u2014 as now yon chain Of gold-tipp'd mountains crown her lawns and bowers. Here countless beauties catch the ravish'd view, Majestic scenes, all silent as the tomb ; Save where the murmuring of Derwent's wave, To tenderest feelings the rapt soul subdue, While shadowy forms seem gliding through the gloom To visit those again they lov'd this side the grave. Chatsworth House was begun on a much more moderate scale than the subsequent design by Sir William Cavendish, who, by his marriage with the celebrated heiress of Hardwick, became possessor of a large estate in this county. Before one wing of the intended fabric was raised, Sir"], [278, "252 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER William died, but his widow, who became Countess of Shrewsbury, completed the whole building in a style which entitled it to be ranked among the wonders of the Peak. \" Qualiter in mediis, quam non speribitur, urbem Attonitus Venetam navita cernit aquis ; Sic improvisa, emergens e montibus imis Attollit sese Devonina Domus.\" As to th' astonish'd seaman's startled sight The city Venice midst the waves appears; Unlooked for, thus, midst many a mountain's height The Devoninian Hall its towers uprears. The ancient mansion appears to have been a quadrangular building with turrets, and when the widow of Sir William became, by her fourth marriage, Countess of Shrewsbury, and was with the Earl, entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, this hall acquired particular interest, as being one of the prisons of that unfortunate princess. In 1570, the unhappy queen was re moved to Chatsworth from Winfield, and then resided here for some months. It also appears that she was at Chatsworth in the years 1573, 1577, 1578 and 1581. In the month of October, 1570, Sir William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burleigh, and Sir Walter Mildmay, visited Chatsworth, and remained there twenty days, being employed in certain negociations between Mary and Queen Elizabeth. On the return of Sir William Cecil to court, he wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury, stating that the queen was willing that her unhappy prisoner should sometimes take the air on horseback in the Earl's company, to the distance of a mile or two. In this letter he says, \"the Q's Maty is pleased yt your L. shall, when yow see tymes mete, suffer yt Quene to take ye ayre about your howss on horsebacke, so your L. be in company ; and not to pass from your howss above one or twoo myle except it be on ye moores.\" But this indulgence was not long continued, and shortly after the Scottish Queen was removed to Sheffield castle, which was her chief resi dence during the ensuing fourteen years. In 1577, Elizabeth wrote with her own hand to thank the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury for their hospitable entertainment of her favourite minister, the Earl of Leicester, at Chatsworth. During the civil wars between the parliament and Charles I. the old hall at Chatsworth was oc cupied as a fortress occasionally by both parties. In 1 643, it was garrisoned by forces under Sir John Gell, on the part of the parliament; and in the December of the same year, the Earl of Newcastle, having taken Winfield manor, made himself master of Chatsworth Hall, and placed a garrison in it for the king, under the command of Colonel Eyre. In September, 1645, it was held for the royal party by Colonel Shalcross, with a fresh garrison from Welbeck, and a skirmish ing force of three hundred horse. It was then besieged by Major Mollanus with four hundred foot, but the siege was raised by the command of Colonel Gell, who ordered the Major and his forces to return to Derby. The description of this building, as it appeared during the times of the Stuarts, by Hobbes, translated by Cotton, will be appropriately inserted in this place. \u2014 \" This palace, with wild prospects girded round, Stands in the middle of a falling ground, At a black mountain's foot, whose craggy brow Secures from eastern tempests all below, Under whose shelter trees and Jlowers grow, \"With early blossoms, maugre native snow ; Which elsewhere round a tyranny maintains, And binds crampt nature long in crystal chains. The fabrick's noble front faces the west, Turning her fair broad shoulders to the east ; On the south side the stately gardens lye, Where the scorn'd Peak rivals proud Italy. And on the north, seven inferior plots For servile use, scatter'd do lye, in spots. \" The outward gale stands near enough, to look Her oval front in the objected brook ; But that she has better reflexion For a fair lake, from wash of floods unmixt, Before it lies an area spread betwixt.

The ponds, which here in double order shine, Are some of them so large, and aU so fine, That Neptune in his progress once did please To frolick in these artificial seas ; Of which a noble monument we finde, His royal chariot, left, it seems, behind : Whose wheels and body moor'd up with a chain, Like Drake's old hulk, at Deptford, still remain. No place on earth was ere discov'red yet, For contemplation or delight so fit.

The muses too pearch on the bending spraies, And in these thickets chant their charming laies ; No wonder then if the He'roick song That here took birth and voice, do flourish long.

So a bright diamond would look, if set In a vile socket of ignoble jet t And such a face the new-born nature took, When out of Chaos by the fiat shook. Doubtless, if any where, there never yet So brave a structure on such ground was set; Which sure the foundress built to reconcile This to the other members of the Isle.

But let me lead you in, 'tis worth the pains T* examine what this princely house contains: Which, if without so glorious to be seen, Honour and virtue make it shine within. The forenam'd outward gate then leads into A spacious court, whence open to the view The noble front ofthe whole edifice, In a surprising height is seen to rise. Even with the gate-house, upon either hand, A neat square turret in the corners stand; On each side plates of ever-springing green, With an ascending pavier-walk between. In the green plat, which on the right hand lies, A fountain, of strange structure, high doth rise, Upon whose slender top, there is a vast, I'd almost said, prodigious bason plac't ; And without doubt, the modte of this piece Came from some other place, than Rome, or Greece, For such a sea, suspended in the air, I never saw in any place but there: Which, should it break or fall, I doubt we shou'd Begin to reckon from the second flood. The new building at Chatsworth was projected by the celebrated fourth Earl (afterwards the first Duke) of Devonshire on his retirement from the court of James II. That nobleman, in order to keep his patriotic mind from dwelling too intensely upon the oppressions of his country, directed his attention to works of architectural taste and magnificence, and resolved to raise a structure worthy his wealth and rank. In this disposition he contracted (says Kennet) with workmen to pull down \" the south side of that good old seat, and to rebuild it on a plan he gave to them, for a front to his gardens, so fair and august, that it looked like a model only of what might be done in after ages. When he had finished this part he meant to go no further ; till seeing public affairs in a happier settlement, for a testimony of ease and joy, he undertook the east side of the quadrangle, and raised it entirely new, in conformity to the south, and seemed then content to say, that he had gone half way through and would leave the rest for his heir. In this resolution he stopped about seven years, and then reassumed courage, and began to lay the foundations for two other sides to complete the noble square, and these last, as far as uniformity admits, do exceed the others, by a west front of most excellent strength and elegance, and a capi- tal on the north side, that is of singular ornament and service. And though such a vast pile (of materials entirely new) required a prodigious expense, yet the building was his least charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water- works, statues, pictures, and other the finest pieces of art and of nature that could be obtained abroad or at home.\" It appears from the auditor's account, and from a book of the artists' and tradesmen's receipts, which are now in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, that the south front of the present magnificent mansion was begun to be rebuilt on the 12th of April, 1687, under the direction of Mr. William Talman, an architect of some celebrity, the latter end of the seventeenth century. The great hall and staircase were covered in about the middle of April, 1690. In May, 1692, the works were surveyed by Sir Christopher Wren,* at which time upwards of \u00a39000. appears to have been expended. In 169S, Mr. Talman was paid \u00a3600. in advance for building the east front and the north-east corner, which was finished in 1700, and in that year the old west front was pulled down. The whole of the building was completed soon after the year 1706, which was about 20 years from its commencement. Mr. Talman received upwards of \u00a313,000. for his contract. \u2022 It is the impression of many that Sir Christopher Wren built two of the fronts of Chatsworth House."], [282, "254 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Artists employed at Chatsworth House. Architect \u2014 William Talman. Painters \u2014 Laguerre and Ricard, who were engaged in January, 1689. These two persons were much employed by Verrio, and it is not improbable that they were sent over by him previous to his own coming. They were paid \u00a3190. for their labours at Chatsworth. Verrio himself did not arrive until November in the following year. He received \u00a390. in advance for ceilings to be executed at Chatsworth. Lord Orford considered the altar-piece at Chatsworth chapel to be Verrio's master-piece: the subject is the incredulity of St. Thomas. In September, 1692, Verrio had finished the great chamber, staircase, and altar-piece. He was paid ,\u00a3469. for his work. \u2014 A Monsieur Huyd was also employed, who appears to have been one of Verrio's assistants. Mr. Highmore, serjeant-painter to William III. was also employed; and a painter of the name of Price. Sir James Thornhill was also engaged, but probably at a somewhat later period, and when he was induced by the paintings of Verrio and Laguerre to enter into their style. He painted the Fall of Phaeton on the back staircase, and in the adjoining ante-chamber, he represented on the ceiling the assembly of the gods. His large picture of the rape of the Sabine women covers nearly one side of the same apartment. Perseus and Andromeda, a large painting which occupies a place in the ante-chamber ofthe Duke's dressing-room, is by this artist. Ironworker \u2014 Monsieur Tijou, a French smith, whose daughter was the wife of Laguerre : he executed the iron balustrades, and received \u00a3528. for his work. Plumber \u2014 Mr. Cock, of London, delivered a bill for work done of nearly \u00a31000. from which a deduction was made of \u00a3236. for overcharge. Carvers in slone \u2014 Caius Gabriel Cibber, father of the celebrated author and comedian Colley Cibber, was engaged in 1687. Two sphinxes on large bases, with ornaments, which are much praised by Lord Orford, were the work of this artist. He carved several door cases with rich foliage, and many ornaments. On each side of the altar is a statue by him, Faith and Hope. It appears from Cibber's receipts that he was employed, in 1688, to make the statues of Pallas, Apollo, and a Triton, for which he had \u00a3100. In I69O, Cibber made figures for the new foun tain, supposed to have been the four sea horses. He received, in the whole, \u00a3310.* \u2014 J. T. Geeraerslius assisted Cibber, and made a sea nymph and other figures, on his own account. \u2014 Augustine Harris was engaged in 1688 : he made seven statues for the garden, for which he was paid \u00a3\u25a0_ \u25a0_. I8_. 6d. \u2014 In 1694, Nost was engaged, and made a statue of Ceres, for which he was paid \u00a330. and two years afterwards, he was paid fifty guineas for a marble figure and a bas-re lief. \u2014 In I696, Davies was paid \u00a324. for a stone statue, and in the year following \u00a3 130. for three bas reliefs and three heads. \u2014 A Mr. Auriol was also employed. Carvers in wood \u2014 With respect to the general opinion that most of the wood carving at Chats worth was executed by the celebrated Grinlin Gibbons, we shall not offer an opinion of our own, but extract the following portion of a note from Lysons. \" It has been of late years universally supposed, that most of the carving in wood at Chats worth was the work of the celebrated Grinlin Gibbons ; but we do not find the least trace of his having been employed there at all. We find, indeed, in the auditor's account, an item of the sum of \u00a314. 15s. paid to Henry Lobb, the carpenter, for cases which conveyed some carved work, statues, and pictures from London : and it is possible that this carved. work might have been from the hand of Gibbons; but we find no memorandum of any money paid for such a purchase. It may be supposed that the principal contractor for the carving might have employed the chisel * In a volume of the Artists' Receipts, now at Hardwicke, is the following memorandum of Cibber's prices, in his own hand ; he says, that the rates he had at my Lord Kingston's were : \" For two figures in the pediment, each of them having four ton of stone in them, \u00a370. for one, and for both \u00a3140. ; for one round statue, having a boy upon its shoulder, \u00a360. ; for four statues which were not wrought round, \u00a342. 10s. Od. per statue ; for two dogs, \u00a38. a piece ; for 12 C\u00e6sar's heads, \u00a35. per head ; my Lord did after this pay for my board, and wine for me and my man. And then I did two sphinxes at \u00a310. a piece, having in them but three-fourths of a ton. For two statues as big as the life, I had \u00a335. a piece, and all charges borne, and at this rate I shall endeavour to serve a nobleman in freestone.\""], [283, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 255 of Gibbons in London. If none of the carving at Chatsworth be the work of Gibbons (and the presumption is certainly against it, whilst there is no proof for it) the consequence is, that the art of carving exquisitely in wood was not confined to so few hands as generally hath been sup posed. The name of Thomas Young, who was certainly during three years the principal carver in wood, is not mentioned by Lord Orford, nor those of Lobb, Davies, or Lanscroon : the latter, or a person of that name, is mentioned as a painter. The slight mention that is made of Watson is erroneous. It is remarkable that no writer, before Lord Orford published his Anecdotes of Painting, &c. ever spoke of the works of Gibbons at Chatsworth. Dr. Leigh, who gave a par ticular description of Chatsworth in 1700, soon after all the principal apartments were finished, speaks of the works of Verrio, but makes no mention of Gibbons ; nor does Dr. Kennet, when describing Chatsworth in his Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish. J. Mackey, who published a Tour through England (the result of actual observation) in 1724, quotes Leigh, and makes no mention of Gibbons, which seems to intimate that the carving was not then shown as his work. It is no improbable supposition that Lord Orford, when he visited Chatsworth, seeing those ex quisite productions of the chisel, so nearly resembling the well known works of this artist at Windsor and elsewhere, concluded that they must be the work of Gibbons, of which, indeed, there appears then to have been a tradition. ' At Chatsworth,' (he observes in the Anecdotes of Painting) ' are many ornaments by Gibbons, particularly in the chapel : in the great antechamber are several dead fowl over the chimney, finely executed ; and over a closet-door a pen, not dis tinguishable from real feather.* When Gibbons had finished his works in that palace, he pre sented the Duke with a point cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his own head, all preserved in a glass case in the gallery.' \" The carvings in wood at Chatsworth are in the highest style of excellence : they consist in representations of dead game, fish, flowers, shells and trophies, variously composed and distributed. Whether they were in part or not the work of the eminent Gibbons, we may observe, with Horace Walpole, \" that there is no instance of a man before Gibbons who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and chained together the various productions of the elements with a free disorder natural to each species.\" It is certain that much of this beautiful carved work at Chats worth was executed by Watson, who studied under Mr. C. Oakley, of London. Samuel Watson was a native of Heanor, in this county, and was engaged jointly with Lobb and Davies, to exe cute the ornaments of the state apartments. He was the friend and associate of Sir James Thorn hill, who painted his portrait, which is now in the possession of Mr. White Watson, of Bakewell. It is stated that he was to have a third part of the work in the great chamber, the ornaments of which were carved in lime-tree, in conjunction with Young and Joel Lobb, and that the whole payment was \u00a3400. He received very liberal prices for all his works, as may be seen by certain items from the original accounts, with the inspection of which we have been favoured by Mr. White Watson, the grandson of this eminent carver, who is in possession of the drawings and de signs from which the carvings were made. These are contained in a folio book, entitled Designs, Agreements, and Bills of Carved Work executed at Chatsworth, by Samuel Watson, from lb\"90 to 1712, &c. &c. \"Sep. 9, 1692. Joel Lobb, William Davies, and Samuel Watson agreed with the Earl of Devonshire to execute in lime-tree, the carving in the great chamber, to be done equal to any thing of the kind before executed, for which they were to receive \u00a3400. : this carving consists of flowers, wreaths, fish, dead game, cherubs, &c. &c. The following agreement upon a stamp, is among Mr. Samuel Watson's papers: \" September 2, 1701.

My mournful friends, forbear your tears, For I shall rise when Christ appears.\" \" This Samuel Watson died 29th March, 1/15, aged 53 years. The arms of Cavendish, in the west front of Chatsworth house, were carved by Mr. Samuel Watson. The arms of Cavendish, in front of the great stables, were carved by Mr. Henry Wat- son, his son. The arms of Rutland, carved in Hopton stone, formerly in front of the Rutland arms' Inn, Bakewell, were carved by Mr. White Watson, F. L. S. and corresponding member of the Edinburgh Royal Physical Society, mineralogist and statuary, Bakewell, nephew of the afore- said Henry, and grandson of Samuel. Notwithstanding these proofs that Watson was chiefly employed in the ornamental carved work at Chatsworth, there is still reason to conclude that Grinling Gibbons formed most of the designs, executed some of the work, and probably superintended the whole ; particularly as it is apparent that the carvings in the chapel and state-rooms are of the same characteristic beauty, and seem to be the production of the same mind. In the Life of Grinling Gibbons, by Allan Cunningham, recently published in the Family Library, we find the claims of that artist strongly enforced. \" All the wood carving in England,\" says the author, \" fades away before that of Gibbons at Chats- worth. The birds seem to live, the foliage to shoot, the flowers to expand beneath your eye. The most marvellous work of all is a net of game ; you imagine at the first glance that the game- keeper has hung up his day's sport on the wall, and that some of the birds are still in the death- flutter He was, however, much assisted at Chatsworth. The designs are L 1"], [286, "258 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER from the pencil of Gibbons, and much of the carving too ; but there is plenty of proof that the hand of Samuel Watson, a Derbyshire man, was extensively employed under him.\" And again, after noticing the observations of Rhodes, and those of Lysons, to which we have already referred, Mr. Cunningham says, \" There can be no doubt that Gibbons was the presiding artist in the em bellishments of that princely residence ofthe Cavendishes. The stamp of his hand is legibly im pressed every where. Who could have given that buoyant elegance to flowers, and that downy softness to feathers except himself? Had the real master-pieces of Chatsworth been Watson's, Watson would not have remained in Derbyshire, to lead an obscure life, and be buried with a doggrell epitaph.\" There is not much argument in these latter observations. Mr. Samuel Wat son died at the age of fifty-three, and almost immediately after serving his apprenticeship in London, was engaged in the works at Chatsworth, which occupied nearly the whole of his time. He was therefore obliged to remain in the comparative obscurity of a provincial life. Gibbons is the well known name of the patriarch of English sculpture. With him ornamental carving rose to its highest excellence in this country. No one has since approached him in the happy boldness and natural freedom of such productions. Under his chisel, stone seemed touched with vegetable life, and wood to look as lilies of the valley and fruit upon the trees. His works chiefly are \u2014 the carvings in St. Paul's choir, the wooden throne at Canterbury, the embellish ments at Chatsworth, Petworth, Burleigh, Houghton, Southwick in Hampshire, where the whole gallery is embroidered in pannels, by Gibbons' own hand ; and the altar-piece of Trinity College, Oxford. This artist was appointed Master Carver in wood to George the First, with a salary of eighteen-pence a day, which splendid allowance he enjoyed from 1714 to 1721, on the third of August in which year he died. The erection of the modern mansion at Chatsworth was begun under the direction of William salman, about the year 1687 ; but it was not completed before the year 1706. The recent ad ditions and improvements at Chatsworth have been made by the present Duke, who has employed the talents of Sir Jeffery Wyatville, since the year 1820, in building an elegant northern wing to the original design. Chatsworth house stands on the east bank of the Derwent, having that river on one side, and on the other a very high hill covered with wood. The approach to the mansion, from Edensor, is by an elegant bridge of three arches, which is ornamented with some fine figures, by Cibber. Northward of this bridge is a small tower, encompassed by a moat, and approached by a large flight of steps, called the bower of Mary Queen of Scots, from a garden which formerly occupied its summit, wherein that unhappy princess passed many of the tedious hours of her confinement. The style of architecture in which the house is built, is the Ionic. The roof is flat and surrounded with a balustrade. The form is nearly square, the south front is 1 83 Jl. 2 in. in length, enriched with pilasters of the Ionic order, resting on a rustic base ; the west front is 172 feet in length, with similar enrichments, and also a pediment supported by half columns of the same order, enclosing a quadrangular court, formed by the four sides of Chatsworth, which in general style and richness of ornament corresponds with the principal fronts of the building. Two sides of this court have open balconies, guarded by stone balustrades, which are divided into different sections by twenty-two intervening parts, that form the pedestals to the same number of busts. The busts are well carved in stone, and represent some of the most distinguished per sonages in the reign of Queen Anne. In this court there are some military trophies, which are said to have been executed from designs by G. Gibbons, the celebrated carver in wood: they are formed into four different subjects, and they embellish the east and west sides of the court. In the centre of which there was formerly a fountain, composed of Derbyshire marble, with the figure of Arion seated on a dolphin. They are the workmanship of Mr. Samuel Watson, of whom mention has been already made. The principal entrance on the west is by a flight of steps, to a terrace which extends the whole length of the building. \u2014 The principal external fronts are the east, the south, and the west. The great northern wing is chiefly intended for the accommodation ofthe Duke's numerous and distinguished visitants. The additions and improvements suggested by his Grace, reflect great credit on the ability displayed by the architect who gave the design, and on all who have been employed under him in the execution of the work ; particularly Mr."], [287, "259 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. Holmes, the clerk of the works, who left Windsor Castle to superintend the erection of this splendid structure. The chasteness of the design, the superiority of the masonry, and every other description of work, display talent of the first character. The arrangement of the whole will remain a lasting memorial ofthe abilities of Sir Jeffery Wyatville, and ofthe taste and mag nificence ofthe sixth Duke of Devonshire. Nearly the whole of the numerous rooms and passages in the new wing have groined arches, or arched roofs. The basement rooms and passages are all built of rubbed ashlar stone, procured from the Duke's quarries at Beeley moor. CHATSWORTH HOUSE WITH THE ADDITION OF THE GREAT NORTH WING. Basement story. The south front is approached by a double flight of steps. On the left hand is the chaplain's room and the chapel ; on the right, is the auditor's room, breakfast-room, bath, and dressing room. The window-sashes are gilt. On the east is the coffee-room, steward's room, housekeeper's room, and still-room ; together with the great hall, and the grotto-room.

The north front contains the book-room, the Duke's private dining-room, the Duke's servants' waiting room, the sub-hall, the servants' waiting room, and various staircases. The north wing is a continuation of the east front, which, with the old part, is 557 feet. In this extension of the north wing are the cockles for warm air, the sculleries, the plate room, the under and upper butlers' pantry, the staircases to the dining-room, the confectionary, the house maids' room, and other offices. On the other side the great passage on the same floor, is the room for the groom of the cham bers, the still-room, the servants' hall, servants' rooms, the kitchen and the kitchen court. There are also the laundry, drying-room, dairy, wash-house, bake-house, scullery, larder, butcher's lobby, and the clerk ofthe work's room, and numerous other offices. The whole of this story is rusticated. The second story. On the south front is the continuation of the chapel, the music-room, billiard-room, and draw ing room, with the south gallery.

To give a minute and particular description of the present mansion, with the additions and im provements made by the present Duke, would occupy more space than we can allow in a com pressed History of the whole county. We shall therefore content ourselves by giving the best description we are enabled to do, of a few of the most interesting apartments which are shown"], [288, "260 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER to the public. The five plans given in the succeeding pages, viz. the three floors of the former house, and the two stories of the northern wing, will convey a more accurate idea of the extent and arrangement of this splendid structure. For the use of the working plans of Sir Jeffery Wyatville, which are given upon a small scale, the Publisher begs to present his sincere acknowledgments. The elegant entrance lodge, leading to the north front, is a chaste Doric structure, and consists of three arched gateways. These arches are divided into compartments, and enriched with car ved roses. The gates are to be of wrought iron, with gold enrichments. The palisading between the trophies on the west front and the lodge gates, are to correspond. The centre or principal gateway leads to the northern entrance. The western gateway leads to the Duke's private ter race, which will be divided from the entrance court by an ornamental wall, with a handsome stone balustrade, the piers of which will be surmounted by sphynxes elegantly sculptured by Rossi. The eastern gateway leads to the office court. The entablature and balustrade are sup ported by eight Doric columns with pilasters. The Entrance or Great Hall is sixty feet by twenty-seven, and strikes the visitor with an air of grandeur. The Mosaic floor of black and white marble was laid down by Mr. Henry Watson, son ofthe celebrated carver, in 1779- The paintings in the hall are as follows. Side Pannel. \u2014 Julius C\u00e6sar sacrificing before his going to the Senate, at the closing of the temple of Janus. Over the Door. \u2014 The death of Julius C\u00e6sar in the Senate House at the foot of Pompey's statue, which is thus celebrated by Akenside : \" When Brutus rose. Refulgent from the stroke of C\u00e6sar's fate, Amid the crowd of patriots, and his arm Aloft extending, like eternal Jove, When guilt brings down the thunder, call'd aloud On Tully's name, and shook his crimson steel, And bade the Father of his Country hail ! For, lo ! the tyrant prostrate in the dust, And Rome again is free.\" He died pierced with twenty-three wounds, the 1 5th of March, B. C. 44, in the 56th year of his age. On the Ceiling. \u2014 The Apotheosis, or Deification of Julius C\u00e6sar. First Oval Compart ment. \u2014 C\u00e6sar passing the Rubicon. Second Oval Compartment. \u2014 C\u00e6sar passing over to his army at Brundusium. From this spacious and noble room, the approach to the staircase is the most magnificent that can be imagined, ascending by a double flight of marble steps, passing between two rocks of variegated alabaster, and guarded by a rich gilt balustrade. We are informed that the approach to the staircase will be altered to a single flight of steps. The Staircase is 34 feet by 24 feet. This part of the house was thought, by Kent, sufficiently elegant to be borrowed for the princely seat of Holkham in Norfolk. The paintings in this apartment are as follows. Over the Window looking into the Hall. \u2014 Iphigenia about to be sacrificed by Calchas, at Aulis. Over the Gallery door. \u2014 The sacrifice of Polyxena at the tomb of Achilles. First Compartment. \u2014 The triumph of Bacchus. Second Compartment. \u2014 The triumph of Cybele. Third Compartment. \u2014 The Nymph Arethusa relating to Ceres that Pluto had carried off her daughter Proserpine. On the Ceiling. \u2014 The triumph of Cybele. In the Niches. \u2014 The statues of Apollo, Lucretia, and Minerva. At the foot of the staircase there are several figures in chiaro oscuro, particularly one of Hercules. From the staircase we entered a long narrow gallery, which is over the colonnade on the north side ofthe quadrangle. The Gallery leading to the Chapel contains nearly one thousand original sketches, by the most eminent Flemish, Venetian, Spanish and Italian masters ; forming altogether an assemblage of drawings, which for number and excellence, can hardly be surpassed in any part of the kingdom. The admirer of the fine arts will enter this attractive and interesting apartment with pleasure, and will leave it with regret. There are also paintings of the four seasons and two flower-pieces, by Baptista. From the gallery we pass on to the beautiful and richly ornamented Chapel."], [289, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 261 The Chapel is wainscoted with cedar; here painting, sculpture and carving, have all contribu ted to its decorations ; the ceiling, and every part of it which is not otherwise appropriated, have been embellished by the pencils of Verrio and Laguerre. The painting on the side ofthe chapel, opposite the windows, is a large piece, representing the miracles of Christ, in which some of the figures are very striking, by Laguerre. In the compartment over the gallery are the twelve dis ciples, and our Redeemer, reproving the incredulity of St. Thomas. This is considered one of the best and most successfid efforts of Verrio's pencil. Pilkington, in his Dictionary of Painters, when speaking of Verrio, says, \" That performance which is accounted his best, is the altar-piece in the chapel at Chatsworth, representing the incredulity of St. Thomas.\" Laguerre' probably had a share in its production, and the visitors at Chatsworth are frequently told by their attendant, it is by that artist. He had a free pencil, and executed with great facility those combinations with which his mind was stored. In the corresponding compartment, over the pulpit, Bartimeus restored to sight. Over the door, Christ talking with the woman of Samaria. Beyond the statuary, the two figures painted in relief are Justice and Mercy. In the spaces between the windows are Charity and Liberality. On the ceiling is painted the Ascension of Christ. Caius Gabriel Cibber sculptured the altar-piece, which is composed of the fluors and marbles of Derb}rshire, exquisitely wrought and highly polished, and enriched with Faith and Hope, in full relief; a vacant niche, apparently intended for a third figure, forms a part of the design of this altar. Charity, as a proper companion to the Faith and Hope of Cibber, might be introduced into this vacant niche, and thus fill up what appears to have been the original intention of the sculptor. The exquisite carving in wood in this chapel, we have no doubt were executed by the celebrated Grinling Gibbons, though various other artists were employed in this department. The floor is of marble, curiously inlaid. The Music-room adjoins the gallery of the chapel. The family are seated in the gallery when divine service is performed. The organ is placed in the Music-room, and has a fine effect. The room is hung with white watered tabby, the chairs and sofas correspond. Over the chimney piece is a half-length portrait of the late Duke of Devonshire, presented to his Grace by Sir Henry Fitz Herbert, bart. The Chaplains-room adjoining the chapel is richly furnished and ornamented with statuary. The Drawing-room is hung with pea-green silk damask, and ornamented with a painted ceiling, by Sir James Thornhill. Over the chimney-piece is a whole-length portrait, by Sir Joshua Rey nolds, of his Royal Highness, William, Duke of Cumberland, who defeated the rebels at the battle of Culloden, in 1 745. Over the doors are some small pieces of fruit, &c. by Reinagle. The Anlc-room is ornamented with a large painting of Diana and Act\u00e6on, Perseus and An dromeda. The old Dining-room, now Drawing-room, is 48 feet long, 28 feet wide and 18 feet high. In this elegant room there is a fine whole-length portrait, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of William, first Duke of Devonshire, who was distinguished as a wit, a scholar, a soldier and a gentleman. A whole-length portrait of George the Fourth, by Sir Thomas Lawrence. Over the doors are tro phies and fancy paintings, by Reinagle. The Duke's Breakfast-room is elegantly furnished, and contains several good portraits ; among them we noticed miniatures of the Emperor and Empress of Russia, half-length portraits of the Empress of Russia, the mother of Alexander, and the Empress Alexander, the Princess Borghese, Buonaparte's sister, by Campbell, Honourable James Abercrombie, Lord High Advo cate of Scotland, Hon. Charles Cavendish and his lady, Canova by Sir Thomas Lawrence, &c. The Duke's Sitting-room is ornamented with interior views of Hardwick hall, by Hunt, a scene from Gil Bias, portraits of Lord Normanby, Agar Ellis, &c. In the Ante-room adjoining to the Duke's sitting-room is the painting of the former House at Chatsworth, built by Sir William Cavendish and the Countess of Shrewsbury. A portrait of Burgoyne, the gamekeeper, on horseback, by Reinagle. The Duke's Private room is richly furnished, and contains a fine whole-length portrait of His Grace, in his robes, by Hayter ; a whole-length portrait of His Grace's mother, with her infant"], [290, "262 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER daughter, the present Countess of Carlisle, on her knee, is an excellent painting. The graceful turn of the head of the principal figure, the happy expression of countenance, the smiling face, and the uplifted outspread hands of the infant, are exquisitely beautiful and true to nature. This picture is entirely and essentially all that it professes to be \u2014 a mother and a child mutually delighting and delighted with each other : it is painted in a full and brilliant tone of colour, and altogether it may be classed amongst the best pictures of Sir Joshua Reynolds ; an equestrian portrait of the present Emperor of Russia, and of the late Emperor Alexander, in a Drowski. (This room is not shown to the public.) In the Housekeepers-room are medals of the Kings of England and of the Roman Emperors, prints ofthe Duke of Bedford, two Duchesses of Devonshire, Prince Leopold and Princess Char lotte, Henry Lord Holland, &c.

These rooms are lined with wood of the choicest description, beautiful and costly cabinets, exquisite carvings, excellent paintings, by the old masters, and fitted up with Gobelins' tapestry, representing the Cartoons of Raphael. The parquetted floors are of oak. The Ante-chamber. Over the door is that carved delineation of a pen, so finely executed, which Mr. Walpole characterized as \" not being distinguishable from real feather.\" The ceiling is adorned with many beautiful paintings. A singular and ludicrous incident is recorded in one part of the ceiling. Mrs. Hackett, formerly housekeeper, is drawn in the character of a fury cutting the thread of life. It is said, that being violently enraged with the painter, he caught the air of her countenance, and represented it in all the deformity with which it then appeared. The State Dining-room or Great Chamber is an elegant and interesting room, 50 ft. by 30 ft. ; over the chimney-piece are the representations of dead game, fish, &c. They are so exquisitely carved in wood, and so accurately grouped, that they have been generally attributed to the cele brated Grinling Gibbons. The design might possibly be from Gibbons, but the execution was chiefly by Samuel Watson, Joel Lobb and William Davies. This room is ornamented with alle gorical paintings.

The Modern common apartments, generally called the apartments of Mary Queen of Scots. It would be an error to suppose that this unfortunate woman ever made use of these apartments ; it is an undoubted fact that she was confined at Chatsworth at intervals during sixteen years, and wrote from this place her second letter to Pope Pius, dated 31st of October, 1570 ; but this event"], [292, "264 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER took place more than a century before the building of the present house. A tradition exists that the apartments occupied by the unhappy Queen of Scots during her temporary residences at Chatsworth, were preserved when the house was re-built. This is not probable, and indeed it is certain, that nearly the whole of the south and east fronts were taken down when the first Duke commenced the building of the present pile, about the end of the 16th century. It is, however asserted, upon tolerably good authority, that the rooms which now bear the name of the royal prisoner, occupy the site of those which she inhabited ; and that which is called her bed-room, is furnished with the same bed and tapestry. In the Crimson Bed-room are two landscapes, by an unknown artist, and a medallion of Philip II. of Spain. In another bed-room are paintings of Bacchus and Ariadne, and Dance in a golden shower.

The recesses between the windows, the ends and west side ofthe library, are fitted up with mahogany book-cases, with looking-glass pannels over them. There is a gallery, supported by bronze metal columns and cantie-levers, to which there is an ascent by a secret winding staircase in the wall : this gallery is surrounded by an elegant bronze balustrade. The mouldings are exquisitely carved and gilt. The floor is parquetted and the doors are mahogany. \u2014 The Ante-Library is 29 ft. 6 in. by lift. 6 in. and 17ft. in height.

They are rich in forest scenery, and are particularly admi red for the picturesque beech, chestnuts and elms with which they abound. The fountains on the south front of the edifice eject the water to an amazing height. On the east front is the great cascade, and the natural waterfall, the latter of which rolls down precipitous rocks to the depth of forty feet. The artificial water-works were designed and executed above a century ago, by a French engineer of the name of Grillet, and have recently been repaired and improved by the desire of his Grace, under the direction of Mr. Paxton and Mr. Holmes. They are curious and interesting as works of art, but, it must be confessed, that works of ingenuity of this class appear to be misplaced among the sublimities of nature which particularly characterize the surrounding scenery. The principal of these artificial contrivances is the Great Cascade, which consists of a series of steps or ridges extending down a steep hill ; and on the highest of the steps is a temple. When the cascade is put in motion, the water rushes from the roof of the temple and from a variety of lions' heads, dolphins, sea-nymphs and other figures that ornament it, and, falling into a basin in front of the building (from which also several fountains issue) is thence discharged down the flight of steps, and, having reached the bottom, disappears by sinking into the earth. Among the other artificial water-works, is a copper tree, made to represent a decayed weeping willow, the branches of which produce a shower. This has been renewed and much enlarged under Mr. Paxton. Here a trick is sometimes practised on the unsuspecting stranger, while his attention is fixed on the object before him, the guide turns a tap which spreads the water to a considerable distance, christening those who may happen to be within its reach. The principal fountain throws up water to the height of nearly a hundred feet. \u2014 The walks have been carried through the wood which clothes the hill on the east of the building. These walks are of some miles in extent, from the necessity of their being conducted in circuitous directions to diminish the steepness of the ascent. The principal walks are thirty feet in width : these, and the pleasure grounds are ornamented with sculptured figures and vases. On the most lofty part of this emi nence is the Hunting Tower. This building is seen at the distance of many miles ; and when his Grace is resident at Chatsworth, a flag is displayed upon its turrets. It is supposed to have been erected as a station where the female visitants could enjoy the spectacle of a stag-hunt without incurring the dangers attendant on the chase : its height, which is ninety feet, as well as its lofty station, would enable them to see across the surrounding hills to a very great distance. The tower is square, with a rounded tower at each angle. The Gardens appropriated to the growth of fruit and vegetables extend over twelve acres of land ; and these are furnished with twenty-two hot-houses and numerous forcing-pits : they are at some distance to the north ofthe house. The Flower gardens have been greatly enlarged, and are intended to surround the house. They are laid out from plans furnished by Sir Jeffery Wyatville, under the superintendence of Mr. Paxton. The style of the gardens on the west front is oriental ; and they are enriched with eight stone baskets elegantly sculptured for shrubs and flowers, thirt3'-two feet square each. In the pleasure grounds there is a Spanish chestnut, planted by the Archduke (now the emperor of Russia) Nicholas; and a variegated sycamore, planted by his brother, the Archduke Michael, in commemoration of their visit. It is unnecessary to say, that the greatest care is taken for the preservation of trees planted by those eminent visitors on such an occasion. \u2014 A large weeping ash tree, that ornamented the nursery-grounds of the Messrs. Wilson, of Derby, between forty and fifty years, was, in April, 1830, removed to Chatsworth, and is now growing luxuriantly in the court on the north front ofthe building. The celebrated philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, passed a great portion of his life at Chatsworth, under the patronage ofthe first Earls of Devonshire. The father of this eccentric scholar was a clergyman, resident at Malmesbury, in Wiltshire, where the subject of this short memoir was born, in the year 158*. In his early studies, under the master of the grammar school in his native town, his proficiency was so rapid, that before he was fifteen years of age he translated the Medea of Euripides into elegant Latin verse. He was entered at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and"], [301, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 273 obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts before he was nineteen, and, in the following year, was recommended by the heads of his college to Lord Hardwick, who was soon afterwards created Earl of Devonshire, as a person well qualified as tutor to the young Lord Cavendish. Mr. Hobbes became the friend and companion of his pupil, and, in the year 1610, accompanied him in his travels through France and Italy. On his return, Mr. Hobbes enjoyed the society, and acquired the esteem of the lord chancellor Bacon, and of the eminent Lord Herbert, of Cherburg. Ben Johnson had so great an esteem for him, that he revised his translation of \" The History of Thucydides,\" While this work was preparing for the press, the Earl of Devonshire died, and shortly after the second Earl, in whose service, as tutor and secretary, Mr. Hobbes had spent twenty years. He was then in his fortieth year, and an offer being made him to accompany the son of Sir Gervase Clifton, he again went abroad, but was recalled to England by the solicit ations of the Countess Dowager of Devonshire, who was desirous of placing under his tuition the young Earl, then in the thirteenth year of his age. In the year 1634, Mr. Hobbes accompanied his noble pupil to Paris and Italy, and returned to England in 1637. Here he continued to reside in that nobleman's family, and wrote his Latin poem on the Wonders of the Peak, which he published in 4to. under the title of \" De Mirabilibus Pecci, Carmen.\" At the commencement of the civil war between the King and Parliament, Mr. Hobbes, who had rendered himself ob noxious to the popular party, by his conversation, retired to Paris, and became intimate with Des Cartes. It was in the year 1642 that he published his work \" De Cive,\" which was the basis of his subsequent famous book entitled \" Leviathan.\" He continued to reside at Paris, where he was recommended to the Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles II.) as a mathematical and philo sophical tutor. During a severe illness with which he was attacked in the metropolis of France, his friend, father Mersenne, attempted his conversion to the catholic faith, but he told the worthy priest that he had debated all those matters in his own mind long before. In the year 1650, he published a small treatise, at London, entitled \" Human Nature,\" which Mr. Addison pronounces to be his best work ; and in the next year appeared his \" Leviathan,\" a work which displays immense learning and ingenuity, and with many sound and important ob servations on politics and government, contains notions that have been regarded as both para doxical and dangerous. Upon its publication, the whole body of the English clergy took the alarm; and the author was not only suspected to be inimical to the cause of revelation, but in politics to favour the cause of democracy. These suspicions dissolved his connexion with Charles II. at Paris, and, according to Lord Clarendon, he was compelled secretly to effect his escape. On his return to his native country, he found a welcome asylum in the Devonshire family, and commonly passed his summers at Chatsworth, and his winters in London. On the restoration of Charles II. Mr. Hobbes attended the Earl of Devonshire to court, where he was well received by the monarch, who admitted him to a private audience, ordered his portrait to be painted by an eminent artist, in order that it might be placed in the royal closet, and settled upon him a pen sion of __100. per annum. His \"Leviathan\" was nevertheless censured by a vote of parliament. He enjoyed, however, the high estimation of the learned men and philosophers of all countries, and among the foreigners of distinction who visited him, was Cosmo de Medicis, then Prince of Tuscany, who, having received his picture and a complete collection of his writings, ordered them to be placed in the library of Florence. In the year 1672, Mr. Hobbes wrote his own Life in Latin verse, when, as he observes, he had completed his eighty-fourth year. In this poem he informs his readers that when he retired to France his whole fortune consisted of \u00a3500. ; and he observes that, with the accession of a legacy of \u00a3200. together with an annuity of \u00a380. a year from his patron, the Earl of Devonshire, he could easily persuade himself that neither Cr\u0153sus nor Crassus were richer than he. In 1674, he published a translation in English verse of four books of Homer's Odyssey, which were so well received by the public, that he was encouraged to undertake a version of the whole Iliad and the remaining books of the Odyssey. This task (an astonishing labour for a man of eighty-seven) he completed, and published the work in 1675; and in less than ten years it ran through three large editions. The versification is very bad, and there are traces throughout of the carelessness n n"], [302, "274 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER or weakness of senility; but Mr. Pope, in his preface to his own translation, admits that the sense is in general correctly given. Mr. Hobbes continued for four years longer to employ himself in literary pursuits, and in the year of his death, he sent his \"Behemoth,\" or a History ofthe Civil Wars, from 1640 to 1660, \" to an eminent bookseller, requesting that it might not be published until an interval of some years had elapsed. The work, however, made its appearance shortly after the decease of the author. He was about this time seized with a suppression of urine, and on being informed by the physician that the complaint would probably be fatal, he said, \" 'Tis well \u2014 I shall find a hole, at last, to creep out of the world at.\" In the month of November, his patron, the Earl of Devonshire, removed from Chatsworth to Hardwick, when Mr. Hobbes earnestly persisting in requesting that he might be carried to the same place, he was conveyed thither upon a feather-bed. He bore the journey without much inconvenience ; but within a few days afterwards, he lost the use of speech and of his right arm by a paralytic attack ; and on the 4th of December, 1679, he died in the 92nd year of his age. Hobbes was a man of strong and capacious mind, and he had greatly enriched his natural powers by his acquired knowledge. He reasoned closely, but he had much in his early preju dices and general habit of thinking to overcome, and it is manifest that he permitted himself to yield slowly to the force of truth. Notwithstanding the devotion to high monarchical principles with which he entered life, and which were fostered by the leading principles of the noble family in which he was so honourably domesticated, his great work, the \" Leviathan,\" insists determi nately on the natural and political equality of mankind, and contains sentiments which, however qualified, are favourable to democracy. If he is an adversary to the doctrines of revealed reli gion, he is an unwilling one, and in his conduct he was a practical adherent to the established church, adopting her creed, and regularly communicating with her members. Ecclesiastical power rather than religion is the topic of his severest animadversions. Considering his position and the times in which he lived, he did much, it must be confessed, towards the emancipation of the human mind, and if his two noble pupils did not catch his tone of ratiocination, he made, it is probable, a deep impression upon the sentiments of that illustrious family, which was seen in the conduct ofthe first Duke of Devonshire at the period ofthe revolution : nor will it ever be con sidered as the least honour of Chatsworth that it was the seat of the lucubrations of Thomas Hobbes. St. Evremond, in one of his letters to Waller, dated from Chatsworth, details some interesting particulars of this extraordinary man, whom he found, as he expresses it, \" like Jupiter, involved in clouds of his own raising.\" He says, \" I now write to you from the Earl of Devonshire's, where I have been this fortnight past, paying my devotions to the Genius of Nature. Nothing can be more romantic than this country except the region about Valois, and nothing can equal this place in beauty but the borders of the lake. \" It was not, however, so much the desire of seeing natural curiosities that drew me hither : there is a certain moral curiosity under this roof which I have long wished to see, and my Lord Devonshire had the goodness to in dulge me by a very kind invitation : I need not tell you that I mean the great philosopher, Mr. Hobbes, so distin guished for the singularity of his sentiments and disposition. I arrived a little before dinner, notwithstanding which, the Earl told me he believed I was too late to see Mr. Hobbes that day. 'As he does not think like other men,' said his Lordship, ' it is his opinion that he should not live like other men ; I suppose he dined about two hours ago, and he is now shut up for the rest of the day : your only time to see him is in the morning, but then he walks so fast up those hills, that unless you are mounted on one of my ablest hunters you will not keep pace with him.' It was not long before I obtained an audience extraordinary of this literary potentate, whom I found, like Jupiter, involved in clouds of his own raising. He was entrenched behind a battery of ten or twelve guns, charged with a stinking combustible called tobacco. Two or three of these he had fired off, and replaced them in the same order. A fourth he levelled so mathematically against me, that I was hardly able to maintain my post, though I assumed the character and dignity of embassador from the republic of letters. ' I am sorry for your republic,' said Hobbes, ' for if they send you to me in that capacity, they either want me or are afraid of me : men have but two motives for their applications \u2014 interest and fear ; but the latter is in my opinion most predominant.' I told him that my commission extended no farther than to make him their compliments, and to enquire after his health. ' If that be all,' said he, ' your republic does nothing more than negociate by the maxims of other states, that is, by hypocrisy : all men are necessarily in a state of war, but all authors hate each other upon principle : for my part, I am at enmity with the whole corps, from the Bishop of Salisbury down to the belman : nay, I hate their writings as much as I do themselves : there is nothing so pernicious as reading ; it destroys all originality of sentiment. My Lord Devonshire has more than ten thousand"], [303, "275 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. volumes in his house : I entreated his Lordship to lodge me as far as possible from that pestilential corner : I have but one book, and that is Euclid, but I begin to be tired of him ; I believe he has done more harm than good ; he has set fools a reasoning.' \u2014 'There is one thing in Mr. Hobbes's conduct,' said Lord Devonshire, ' that I am unable to account for: he is always railing at books, yet always adding to their number.' \u2014 'I write, my Lord,' answered Hobbes, ' to show the folly of writing. Were all the books in the world on board one vessel, I should feel a greater pleasure than that Lucretius speaks of in seeing the wreck.' \u2014 ' But should you feel no tenderness for your own pro ductions ?' \u2014 'I care for nothing,' added he, ' but the Leviathan, and that might possibly escape by swimming.' \" As he had frequently changed his political principles, I did not think it of consequence to enquire into his ideas of government ; but in the course of conversation, I found that he looked upon the principal engine of administration to be Fear. ' All government,' said he, ' is in itself an evil : it is nothing but the continual imposition of terror and inflictions of punishment : it must be owned that it is an evil which the natural depravity of men has rendered neces sary to the existence of society ; but still, it cannot in itself be looked upon with any other sensations than such as are excited by the view of its several instruments \u2014 the scourge, the gibbet, and the jail \u2014 the sight of majesty inspires me with no other ideas than such as arise when I see the lowest executioner of the civil power.' \u2014 ' That is,' said Lord Devonshire, 'you have the same respect for the king as the hangman.' \u2014 'Pardon me, my Lord,' returned Hobbes, recollecting himself, ' the king is a very worthy gentleman : you know I had the honour of teaching him philosophy at Paris.' \u2014 'Oh, Mr. Hobbes,' replied his Lordship, 'in that respect your royal pupil does you much honour.' \" The celebrated Marshal Tallard, who was taken prisoner on the plains of Hochstedt, near Blenheim, by the Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, remained a prisoner in this country during a period of seven years. He was invited by the Duke of Devonshire to Chatsworth, and nobly entertained by him for several days. On departing, he paid his Grace this pleasing compli ment : \" My Lord Duke, when I compute the days of my captivity in England, I shall leave out those I have passed at Chatsworth.\" In September, 1768, the king of Denmark visited Chatsworth, and was entertained there with great splendour, during his tour through the north of England. In 181 6, the present Emperor of Russia, then the Archduke Nicholas, was, during the month of December, magnificently entertained by the present Duke of Devonshire ; and this reception was most cordially remembered when his Grace was appointed ambassador to St. Petersburgh, to congratulate his Imperial Majesty on his accession to the throne. \u2014 In 1818, the Grand Duke Michael of Russia, then on a tour through England, was received with splendid hospitality at Chatsworth."], [304, "276 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER \u25a0 TITLES.

The illustrious family of Cavendish derives its origin from one ofthe branches of the De Ger nons, whose ancestor was a distinguished officer, in the service of William of Normandy, and who received from the Conqueror donations of land in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, and other coun ties. The founder of the line, which has given to the country the patriotic Earls and Dukes of Devonshire, was Geoffrey, designated of Moor hall, in Derbyshire, who lived in the reign of Ed ward I. His son Roger, resided at Grimstone hall, in the county of Suffolk, and having espous ed the daughter and heiress of John Pottin or Potkins, lord of the manor of Cavendish, his chil dren, in compliment to their mother, assumed the name of Cavendish. This Roger died in the reign of Edward II. leaving three sons, John, Roger and Stephen. The eldest became Lord Chief Justice in 1366, and was chancellor of the University of Cambridge. This eminent man was seized by the insurgents of Suffolk, as he was returning from suppressing an insurrection in York, in 1381, and beheaded at Bury St. Edmunds. By his will, dated 4 Richard II. he was buried in the chancel of the church of Cavendish, and numerous manors and other possessions were bequeathed to his son, Andrew Cavendish. From Roger the second brother of the Lord Chief Justice, descended the famous circumnavigator, Sir Thomas Cavendish, who, in the year 1586, undertook the third voyage round the world. His third brother, Stephen, was bred to trade, and represented the city of London in parliament, arid was also lord mayor. \u2014 Andrew, the eldest son of the Lord Chief Justice, left issue a son, from whom the estates passed, by fine, to William, the eldest son of Sir John Cavendish, who was the second son of the Lord Chief Jus tice.* This Sir John was knighted for slaying Wat Tyler, in 1379, and had an annuity of forty pounds per annum settled upon him and his heirs. He was one of the Esquires of the body to Richard II. and Henry V. to the last of whom he was embroiderer ofthe wardrobe, and in Octo ber, 1415, he was present at the battle of Agincourt. In a direct line from Sir John, in the fourth descent, we find Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, who rose to great distinction during the reign of Henry VIII. through the influence of Cardinal Wolsey. After the death ofthe Cardinal, the monarch took him into favour, and told him \" he should be his servant in his chamber, as he had been with his former master.\" At the suppression of the religious houses, Sir William was appointed one of the commissioners for visiting them ; and some time afterwards, he was made one of the auditors of the court of augmentation, which was instituted for the extinction of mo nastic establishments. Three manors in Hertfordshire were the reward of his services, and he was appointed treasurer of the chamber and privy counsellor. In the reign of Edward VI. he exchanged his Hertfordshire manors for several lands, &c. belonging to the dissolved priories and abbeys in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Dorsetshire, Cornwall, Kent and Essex, besides Northawberry in Lincolnshire, the site of the priory and rectory of Cardigan, in South Wales, with other lands in Cornwall and elsewhere. The third wife of Sir William Cavendish * Cavendish is a towne or village in Suffolke, -wherein the valiant gentleman, John Cavendish, esq. who slew that arch rebell, Watt Tyler, Anno Reg. Regis, Ric. 2. 4. was borne, which fact was not long unrevenged, for, in the same yeare, the rebels of Norfolke and Suffolke, under the conduct of their captaine, Sir John Wraw (a detestable priest) took Sir John Cavendish, knight, cousin to the foresaid John, Chiefe Justice ofthe King's Bench, and beheaded him, together with Sir John of Cambridge, prior of St. Edmundsbury, whose heads they set on the pillory in the market place.

This lady was subsequently the Countess of Shrewsbury. Being co-heiress with her brother, she brought the manor of Hardwick, with other very considerable property to the Cavendish family. She built three of the most elegant seats that were ever raised at the expense of one family within the same county. These were Chatsworth. Hardwick and Old Cotes, and these were all transmitted entire to the first Duke of Devonshire. When the unfortunate Mary, queen of Scots, was committed prisoner to the care of the Earl of Shrewsbury for seventeen years, the Countess was appointed the keeper of her majesty, and some of the queen's needle work is still preserved at Chatsworth and Hardwick. \u2014 From the second son of Sir William Cavendish and this lady, has descended the first branch of this illustrious family. This second son, Sir William, was created Earl of Devonshire and Baron Hardwick by James I. in 1618 : his lordship contributed greatly to the rise of the English colonies in North America, particularly those of Virginia and t_ie Bermudas, ofthe largest of which last, one ofthe eight divisions is still known by the name of Cavendish. His Lordship became possessed of a larger fortune than his elder brother. He died in 1625, and was buried at Edensor, where an elegant Latin epitaph, in scribed on his tomb, represents him as a \" Man born to execute every laudable enterprise, and in the simplicity of virtue, rather deserving than courting Glory.\" The celebrated Countess of Shrewsbury is thus spoken of by Dugdale. She was one ofthe daughters of John Hardwick, of Hardwick, in the county of Derby, esq. (sister and co-heir to John her brother.) Her marriage with Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, greatly conduced to the enlargement of the Cavendish property. \" For,\" says Dugdale, \" being a person as well politick as faire and beautiful, in time she became mistress of a very vast fortune, by her success ful matching with several wealthy husbands ; whereof the first was Robert Barley, of Barley, in Com. Derb. esq. ; of whose great affections to her she made such advantage, that, for lack of issue by her, he settled a large inheritance in lands upon herself and her heirs ; which, by his death, within a short time after*'; she fully enjoyed ; and then became the wife of this Sir William Caven dish, by whom she had issue three sons ; Henry, William and Charles ; and three daughters ; viz. Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierpont, knt.; Elizabeth, to Charles Stuart, Earl of Lenox ; and Mary, to Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury. \" But the greatest access of riches was by this prudent lady afterwards acquired ; for, surviving Sir William Cavendish, and discerning herself still youthful and amiable, and likewise courted by many, she made choice of Sir William St. Lo, knight (though much superior to her in years) then Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth, and possessor of divers faire lordships in Gloucestershire. With whom she made such termes, in order to her marriage with him, as that she fixt the inher itance thereof upon herself and her own heirs (for fault of issue by him) excluding his own daughters and brothers. \" Whereupon, overliving him, and by that means gaining his whole estate ; as also discerning, that George, Earl of Shrewsbury (at that time one of the greatest Peers of this Realm) was capti vated with her beauty ; she stood upon such termes with him, that unless he would yield, that Gilbert, then his second son, but afterwards his heir, should take Mary, her daughter, to wife ; and that Henry, her eldest son, should marry the Lady Grace, his youngest daughter ; besides the settling of a large joynture in lands upon herself, he must not enjoy her. Unto all which he condescending (and much more after) became her husband. Whereupon, surviving him, and abounding in riches, she built those noble houses of Chatsworth, Hardwick and Oldcoles, all in Derbyshire, which her great-grandson doth at this day enjoy: and departing this life, 13 Febr.

She was married first to Robert Barley, of Barley, in the said county of Derby, esq. ; afterwards to William Cavendish, of Chats worth, knt. Treasurer of the Chamber to the kings Henry VIII. and Edward VI. and queen Mary, to whom he was also a privy councellor. She then became the wife of Sir William St. Lo, captain of the royal guard. Her last husband was the most noble George, (\"Talbot) Earl of Shrewsbury. By Sir William Cavendish alone she had issue. This was three sons, namely, Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury, in the county of Stafford, esq. ; who took to wife Grace, the daughter of the said George, Earl of Shrewsbury, but died without legitimate issue ; William, created Baron Cavendish of Hardwicke, and Earl of Devonshire, by his late Majesty King James ; and Charles Cavendish, of Welbeck, knt. father of the most honourable William Cavendish, Knight of the Bath, and Baron Ogle, by right of his mother, and on account of his merit created Viscount Mansfield; Earl, Marquess, and Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne ; and Earl Ogle, of Ogle.

She founded the almshouses in Full-street, Derby, and drew up the regulations on which they still continue to be managed. These she endowed out of her manor at Little Longstone. \u2014 The free-school at Hardwick is of her establishing. There are also other charitable institutions throughout those parts of the county to which the Cavendish estates extend, that owe their origin to this eminent woman. Lodge, in his Illustrations of British History, gives the following character of this celebrated lady. \" She was a woman of masculine understanding and conduct, proud, furious, selfish, and unfeeling. She was a builder, a buyer and seller of estates, a money lender, a farmer, a merchant of lead, coals, and timber. When disengaged from these employments, she intrigued alternately with Elizabeth and Mary, always to the prejudice and terror of her husband. She lived to a great old age, continually flattered, but seldom deceived, and died immensely rich, and without a friend. The Earl was withdrawn by death from these complicated plagues, on the 1 8th of Nov. 1 590.\" In the disputes between the Countess and her husband, which had proceeded to an open rupture towards the latter part of his life, the Queen took the Lady's part, enjoined the Earl the irksome task of submission, and allowed him a rent of \u00a3500. per annum out of his estate, leaving, as it appears, the whole disposal of the remainder in the Countess's hands. In a letter to the Earl of Leicester, dated April 30, 1585, he says, \" Sith that her Ma'tie hathe sett dowen this hard sentence agaynst me, to my perpetual infamy and dishonor, to be ruled and everanne by my wief, so bad and wicked a woman ; yet her Ma'tie shall see that I obey her com'andemente, thoughe no curse or plage in the earthe cold be more grevous to me. These offers of my wiefes inclosed in yo'r L'res, I thinke theim verey unfyt to be offered to me. It is to muche to make me my wiefes pen cyoner, and sett me downe the demeanes of Chattesworth, without the house and other lands leased, which is but a penc'on in money.

Chancelor.\" From this time they appear to have lived separate. The Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (Overton) in a long letter, in which he labours to bring about a reconcilia tion, appears to take the Lady's part, though he admits that she was reported to be a shrew. \" Some will say, (observes the Bishop) in y'r L. behalfe tho' the Countesse is a sharpe and bitter shrew e, and therefore lieke enough to shorten y'r liefe if shee should kepe yow company : In deede my good Lo. I have heard some say so ; but if shrewdnesse or sharpnesse may be a just cause of sep'a'con betweene a man and wiefe, I thincke fewe men in Englande woulde keepe theire wives longe ; for it is a com'on jeste, yet trewe in some sence, that there is but one shrewe in all the worlde, and ev'y man hath her ; and so ev'y man might be ridd of his wiefe, that wold be rydd of a shrewe.\" The third son, Sir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover, had a son who became Duke of Newcastle, and has already been mentioned in this work, under the article Bolsover. The second Earl of Devonshire was the second son of the first Earl. His Lordship was dis tinguished for his classical knowledge and mental attainments. He was a great speaker in both houses of Parliament, where he was beloved and admired. He also upheld the dignity of his family in all public transactions, in which he was deeply engaged during his short life, which terminated in 1628. He travelled through France and Italy, with the celebrated philosopher Hobbes for his tutor, to whom, during his own life, he continued his friendship and patronage. His Lordship espoused Christiana, daughter of Edward, Lord Bruce, of Kinloss, and sister to Thomas, Earl of Elgin, descended from the Kings of Scotland. This lady was respected for her address and judgment as well as her economy and resolution. Being left a widow at an early period of her life, with three children, the eldest of whom had not attained the age of eleven, and with the immense estates of the family greatly encumbered by the splendid style in which the Earl had lived, she, by her good management during the minority of the young Earl, paid off the debts and terminated many expensive law-suits. She committed the education of the youthful peer to the friend and tutor of his father, and Mr. Hobbes privately instructed him at his own house for three years, and travelled into foreign parts with him three years more. On their re turn, the aged philosopher was maintained by the Devonshire family in ease and plenty until his"], [311, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 283 death, which did not happen before his 92nd year. \u2014 During the civil war between the unfor tunate Charles I. and the Parliament, the Earl of Devonshire went abroad, and his estates were sequestrated. The Countess dowager was held in great estimation by leading persons of both parties, but she never remitted her endeavours to serve the royal cause, even when all expecta tions of success in the field had terminated. While she resided at Latimers, a seat be'ono-ino- to the family, in Buckinghamshire, the king was brought thither prisoner, and was for two nights entertained by her and her son. So steadfast was she in the cause of the king, that the politic General Monk sent her, by a considerable officer, a private signal by which she might know his intentions of restoring the monarchy. After a long life spent in acts of hospitality and charity, and still with splendour and magnificence, this eminent lady departed this life in the year 1674, and was buried at Derby. Charles Cavendish, esq. a younger brother of the Earl of Devonshire, distinguished himself as a loyal and brave subject on the behalf of his King during the rebellion, in which, after perform ing many gallant exploits, he perished fighting nobly near Gainsborough, in 1642-3. Cromwell was in this engagement, and boasted not a little ofthe advantage he had gained on this occasion. He was buried first at Newark, and afterwards removed to Derby. \" Colonel Cavendish was the son of William, Earl of Devonshire, and a person of such a manly figure, winning presence, polite arts, and personal courage, that he was the love and admiration of all that conversed with him and beheld him ; insomuch, that when he was brought into this town to be interred, the people would not suffer him to be buried, till for some days they had viewed his body with their eyes, and embalmed it with their tears. When his body was removed to Derby, thirty years after, fresh lamentations were made for him by all that knew him, so unwilling were they to part with the reliques of a person, who, while living, had been the ornament and defence both ofthe town and country round about.\" Anon. Hist, of Nolls. 1742. The third Earl of Devonshire was not backward in testifying the loyalty which was so dis tinguished in his parents, and opposed every approach to the rebellion, which afterwards broke out and destroyed the monarchy. He withdrew from England when his services could be of no avail ; and although he suffered much for his loyalty, yet he never engaged in public business or sought employment at court. Nevertheless, he enjoyed the confidence of his majesty, Charles the Second, until his death, which took place at Roehampton, in 1684, when he was succeeded by his eldest son, then in his 44th year ; an illustrious patriot and enterprising statesman. The fourth Earl and first Duke, after a regular course of studies, made the tour of Europe, attended by Dr. Killegrew, who was subsequently master of the Savoy. He sat in the long par- liament, immediately after the Restoration, as member for the county of Derby. During the Dutch wars he attended the Duke of York, and was present at that memorable engagement, on the 3rd of June, 1665, when the Hollanders lost two and thirty ships of war. Four years after- wards, he accompanied Mr. Montague in his embassy to the court of France, and during his resi- dence at the capital of that kingdom, he distinguished himself by his personal courage. As a member of the House of Commons, he was a strenuous asserter of the rights of Parliament : he had an honest heart, an able head, and a great fluency of expression. He remained a member of the Commons House of Parliament until the death of his father. So attached was he to that es- timable and interesting patriot, Lord Russell, that he sent a message to him by Sir James Forbes, declaring that he would come to his prison and exchange clothes with him in order to effect, if possible, his escape. A nobleman of such principles was not likely to contemplate with satisfac- tion, the accession of a prince like the Duke of York, bigoted to the dominion of a foreign priest- hood, and insisting upon the divine right of the crown. The noble Earl was, accordingly, a de- termined advocate for the Bill of exclusion, and by this and other public acts incurred the hatred of the mis-directed monarch, James II. It is stated that soon after the accession of that prince, his lordship, having in the king's presence chamber met with Colonel Colepepper, by whom he had been insulted, took him by the nose and led him out of the room. For this action, a prose cution was commenced in the court of King's Bench, and his lordship was condemned to pay a fine of \u00a330,000. and was committed to prison. On his making his escape, a precept was directed"], [312, "284 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER to the sheriff of Derbyshire, to raise the posse comilalus and to take the Earl prisoner to London. The Countess dowager offered to deliver up to the king bonds and acknowledgements to the amount of double the fine, which her ladyship held for money lent by the Earl's father and grand father to the Royal Family in their deepest distress ; but this offer was rejected. The Earl was at length induced to give his bond for the \u00a330,000. This bond was found among the papers of James after his abdication, and returned to the Earl by King William. After this affair, until his Lordship's attention was again called to the great political events of the Revolution, he employed himself in consultations with architects and with their plans for the magnificent edifice of modern Chatsworth, exemplifying the richness of his taste by devising and collecting ornaments for that beautiful structure. The conduct of the king had, in the mean time, alarmed and disgusted his subjects, and the Earl of Devonshire took the lead with other eminent patriots in inviting over the Prince and Princess of Orange, to whom he pledged his support throughout their noble purpose of delivering the nation from the tyranny, civil and ecclesiastical, under which it was suffering. As soon as his Lordship received intelligence of the Prince's landing, he marched at the head of his retinue to Derby, where many of the principal noblemen and gentlemen of that and the neighbouring counties, resorted at his Lordship's invitation, and were nobly entertained by him. Having received the Prince's declaration, he read and explained it to the mayor and commonalty of Derby, and then produced a paper drawn up by himself, and signed by the nobility and gen try with him, in which they declared, that if the King should refuse to consent to the meeting and sitting of a Parliament, freely and duly chosen, they would, to the utmost, defend the Protes tant religion, the laws of the kingdom, and the rights and liberties of the people. Not long after a new declaration was drawn up at Nottingham, which, after enumerating the various illegal acts and arbitrary proceedings of the King and his ministers, and making proper observations upon them, concluded with signifying the intention of his Lordship and his friends to join the Prince of Orange. In consequence of this a regiment of horse was formed, under the command of the Earl of Devonshire, who, from that time forward, exerted himself with the utmost zeal and spirit, in the cause of the Revolution. Soon after the accession of William and his Queen, his Lordship was admitted into the Privy Council, and made Lord Steward of the household. He was also appointed Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire, and created Knight of the Garter. It reflects the highest honour on his memory, that while he displayed an abhorrence to Popery, he was too conscientious a friend to religious liberty, to entertain the most distant idea of persecution ; and he sometimes fearlessly reminded King William, that he came over, not to persecute the Papists, but to defend the Protestants. The Earl attended King William to the Congress of the princes of Germany, held at the Hague, in January, 1 690, and was in the shallop or royal yacht with him, when he and all his attendants were in the most imminent danger of perishing. When the congress met, few of the sovereign princes who assisted at its deliberations, equalled the Earl in the magnificence of his furniture and plate, and the splendour of his entertainments. In May, 1694, his Lordship was created Marquess of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire. In the preamble to the patent, their Majesties expatiate in his praise, and acknowledge how much they were indebted to his assistance in re storing the ancient rights and liberties of the nation. Repeatedly during the absence of the King his Grace was named in the Royal Commission for conducting the business of the Crown ; and on the accession of Queen Anne, he retained the favour of that princess. It was chiefly owing to the Duke of Devonshire, that the bill against occasional conformity (which was, in fact, a bill tending to abolish all freedom in religious matters, and would have been a disgrace to a free country) miscarried in the House of Lords His Grace was nominated one of the commissioners to treat with the commissioners of Scotland concerning a union between the two kingdoms; and when, after the miscarriage of the first negociation, the design was resumed in 1706, both the Duke and his eldest son, the Marquess of Hartington, were put into the commission. In the celebrated case of Ashby and White, which concerned the rights of electors and implicated the dignity of both Houses of Parliament, His Grace distinguished himself by his public spirited declarations in the House of Lords, while his son, the Marquess, did the same in the Commons."], [313, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 285 His Grace was also one of the sixty-one peers in a majority against thirty, who, upon a division, after long and violent debates relative to the danger of the church, resolved, that \" the Church of England is now, by God's blessing, in a most safe and flourishing condition, and that, whoever goes about to insinuate that the Church is in danger under her Majesty's administration, is an ene my to the Queen, the Church and the Kingdom.\" \u2014 After an active political life spent in pro moting the civil and religious liberties ofthe country, this patriotic nobleman expired at Devon shire House, in Piccadilly, London, in the 67th year of his age, in 1707- His Grace united to a liberal mind, great political foresight, and was considered a wise and resolute statesman. Pie possessed an elegant and discriminating taste, which he had much enriched by observation and reading. Chatsworth remains as a monument of his love of the fine arts, and the Revolution of l68S is an historical proof of his ardent attachment to the liberties of his country. He was the author of an ode on the Death of Queen Mary, and a work entitled an allusion to the Bishop of Cambray's Supplement to Homer. The following inscription is said to have been left by his Grace to be inscribed upon his monument : Gulielmus, Dux Devoni\u00e6, William, Duke of Devonshire, A faithful subject to good Sovereigns, Inimical and hateful to Tyrants. Bonorum Principium subditus sidelis, Inimicus et invis us Tyrannis. William, the second Duke of Devonshire, succeeded his father not only in his titles and estates, but likewise in his places and trusts. While a Commoner he served as Knight of the Shire for Derbyshire in the Parliaments of 1 695, l6y8, and 1700; and for Yorkshire in 1702, 1705, and 1707- While Marquess of Hartington he was constituted Captain of the Yeomanry of the Guard ; 6th September, 1707, declared Lord Steward of the Household; Sth September sworn of the Privy Council ; 29th October following, Justice in Eyre, north of Trent, and also Lord Lieu tenant ofthe county of Derby. May 10th, 1708, again sworn ofthe Privy Council ; in 1710 he resigned his places, but having been elected Knight of the Garter he was installed the same year. On the accession of George I. he was nominated one of the Regents of the Kingdom, declared Lord Steward of the King's Household, and sworn of the Privy Council. On 5th July, 1716, he resigned the office of Lord Steward, and the next day was declared Lord President of the Council, which he resigned in April, 1717. In 1720, His Grace was again declared one of the Justices ofthe Kingdom ; in 1725, Lord President ofthe Council ; and in May, 1727, a fifth time declared one of the Lords Justices ; the same year His Grace was reappointed Lord Lieutenant ofthe County of Derby; 4th October, Lord President of the Council; and, 1 7th November, one ofthe Governors ofthe Charter House. He died in London, 3rd June, 1729, and was interred with his ancestors at Derby the 14th of the same month. His Grace married Rachael, the daughter of William Lord Russell, and sister of Wriothesley, Duke of Bedford, and by her had issue, five sons and six daughters. William, the third Duke of Devonshire, born in 1698, like his predecessors had a considerable share in the administration of the public affairs of the kingdom. He served in Parliament whilst a Commoner for the boroughs of Lostwithiel and Grampound, and for the county of Huntingdon. In 1726 he was constituted Captain ofthe Band of Gentlemen Pensioners; succeeding his father in his honours, His Grace was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the county of Derby, and sworn of the Privy Council ; and 12th June, 1731, declared Lord Keeper ofthe Privy Seal. In 1733, His Grace was Lord Steward ofthe Household, and installed Knight ofthe Garter 22nd of August in the same year. He was declared Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 31st of March, 1737, which office he held until the 3_d of January, 1744, when he was again made Lord Steward ofthe Household during his Majesty's absence from the Kingdom. His Grace was one of the Lords Justices in 1741, 1743, 1745, and 1748, and continued Lord Steward of the Household until June, 1749, when he resigned that office. Towards the end of his life, His Grace relinquished all public business and retired to Chatsworth, where he died, 5th December, 1755, and was buried with his ancestors at Derby, the 17th ofthe same month. His Grace married the only daughter"], [314, "286 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER and heiress of John Hoskins, of the county of Middlesex, esq. and had issue, four sons and three daughters. Lord James Cavendish, the third son of the second Duke, was in 1 730, Colonel and Captain in the 3rd regiment of Foot Guards ; in 1 738, made Colonel of the 34th regiment of Foot ; Member of Parliament for Malton; died 5th November, 1741, and buried at Derby on the 14th of the same month. Lord Charles Cavendish, the fourth son, was M. P. for Heytesbury, in Wiltshire, in 1725 ; in 1727, for the city of Westminster; in 1728, Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales; and in 1734, chosen M. P. for the county of Derby. He died 28th of April, 1783, and was buried at Derby on the 7th of May following. William, the fourth Duke of Devonshire, born in 1720, was at the general election in 1747, M. P. for the county of Derby. On the 13th of June, 1751, he was called up to the House of Lords, in the lifetime of his father, and took his seat there as Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick, with precedency, according to the Patent granted to his ancestor, on the 4th of May, 1605. He was appointed Master of the Horse, 30th March, 1752, and three days afterwards sworn of the Privy Council. He was appointed one ofthe Lords ofthe Regency in January, 1754; constitu ted Governor of the county of Cork, in Ireland, in the February following ; Lord High Treasurer of that Kingdom in the place of the last Earl of Burlington, 27th of March, 1755 ; Lord Lieu tenant of Ireland, 1 6th November, 1756; First Commissioner of the Treasury, 15th of December in the same year; Lord Lieutenant of the county of Derby and Knight of the Garter in 1757- In May, 1757, His Grace was appointed Chamberlain of the Household, (having first resigned his seat at the Treasury Board) upon the death of the Duke of Grafton, in which station he as sisted at the coronation of George III. In 1762, he resigned all his employments in England depending on the crown, being disgusted, as it was said, at the high degree of favour and influence possessed by the Earl of Bute. His Grace married, 28th March, 1 748, Charlotte, the third daugh ter and at length heiress of Richard, Earl of Burlington and Cork, by which union the Barony of Clifford, created by Writ of Charles I. in 1628, came into this family. By this marriage he had issue, three sons and one daughter. His Grace died at the German Spa, whither he had gone for the recovery of his health, 3rd of October, 1764, and was buried at Derby 24th of the same month. Lord George Augustus, brother of the fourth Duke, was appointed in October, 1761, Comp troller of the Household ; and in 1 762, sworn of the Privy Council. He died unmarried, and was buried at Holkar, in the county of Lancaster, in 179&- Lord Frederick Cavendish, third son of the third Duke of Devonshire, rose to the rank of Field Marshal, and was taken prisoner at the battle of St. Cas, in 1 758, but was afterwards allowed to return home on his parole. Lord John Cavendish, fourth son of the third Duke of Devonshire, was distinguished as the friend of Lord Rockingham and the opponent of Lord North. He was twice Chancellor of the Exchequer, many years Member of Parliament for the county of Derby, and died in 1796. Lady Caroline married William Ponsonby, Lord Viscount Duncannon, son and heir of Braba zon, Earl of Besborough. The Hon. Henry Cavendish, son of Lord Charles Cavendish, nephew to the third Duke of Devonshire, and great-uncle to the present Duke of Devonshire, died on the 24th of February, 1810, at his house at Clapham. His remains were removed from thence to be privately interred in the family vault, in All Saints' church, Derby. This gentleman had rendered himself familiarly conversant with every part of Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy : the principles of which he applied, nearly fifty years ago, to an investigation of the laws on which the phenomena of electricity de pend. Pursuing the same science, on the occasion of Mr. Walsh's experiment with the torpedo, he gave a satisfactory explanation of the remarkable powers of electrical fishes ; pointing out that distinction between common and animal electricity, which has since been amply confirmed by the brilliant discoveries in galvanism. Having turned his attention very early to pneumatic chemistry, he ascertained, in 1766, the extreme levity of inflammable air, now called hydrogen gas. On this"], [315, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 287 discovery, many curious experiments, and particularly that of aerial navigation, have been founded. In the same path of science, he made the important discovery ofthe composition of water by the union of two airs ; and thus laid the foundation of the modern system of chemistry, which rests principally on this fact, and that of the decomposition of water, announced soon afterwards, by M. Lavoisier. As the purity of atmospherical air had been a subject of controversy, Mr. Caven dish contrived essential improvements in the method of performing experiments with an eudiome ter ; by means of which, he was the first who showed that the proportion of pure air in the atmos phere is nearly the same in all open places. The other and much larger portion of our atmosphere, he sagaciously conjectured to be the basis of the acid of nitre ; an opinion that he soon brought to the test by an ingenious and laborious experiment, which completely proved its truth ; whence this air has now very generally obtained the name of nitrogen. So many and such important discoveries spread his fame throughout Europe, and he was universally considered as one of the first philosophers of the age. Among the labours of his later days, is the nice and difficult ex periment by which he determined the mean density of the earth ; an element of consequence in delicate calculations of astronomy, as well as in geological enquiries. Even in the last year of his life, at the advanced age of seventy-seven, he proposed and described improvements in the manner of dividing large astronomical instruments ; which, though not yet executed, promise very great advantages. These pursuits, together with reading of various kinds, by which he acquired a deep insight into almost every topic of general knowledge, formed the whole occupation of his life, and were, in fact, his sole amusement. The love of truth was sufficient to fill his mind. From his attachment to such occupations, and the constant resource he found in them, together with a shy ness and diffidence natural to his disposition, his early habits had been secluded. His manners were mild, his mind firm, his nature benevolent and complacent. He was liberal without being profuse, and charitable without ostentation. He possessed great affluence, which was to him rather a matter of embarrassment than of gratification ; but, however careless about its improve ment, he was regular in its management and direction. He was born Oct. 10, 1731, and died in 1810, at the age of 79, leaving the greatest sum in funded property which perhaps any person ever possessed, amounting to \u00a31,200,000. His writings on subjects of science appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of 1 766 and subsequent years. The stamp-duty upon Mr. Cavendish's will amounted to \u00a342,000. William, the fifth Duke of Devonshire, born 14th December, 1748, maintained the independent spirit of his father, and held no public situations under the crown except the Lord Lieutenancy for the county of Derby, which is an office almost necessarily attached to the extensive possessions of the family in the county. His Grace married in 1774, Georgiana, daughter of John Earl Spencer, of Althorpe, in the county of Northampton, who died 30th March, 1 806, by whom he had William Spencer, born in Paris 21st of May, 1790; and two daughters, Georgiana, born 12th July, 1783, married 21st March, 1801, George, Lord Morpeth (now Earl of Carlisle) ; and Henrietta Elizabeth, born 12th of August, 1785, married 24th December, 1809, Lord Viscount Granville. His Grace married again, 19th October, 1809, to Lady Elizabeth Forster, relict of John Thomas Forster, esq. of the county of Louth, Ireland, and daughter of the late Earl of Bristol; he died in London 29th July, 1811, aged 63, and was laid in the family vault with his forefathers, in All Saints' church, Derby. Lord George Augustus Henry Cavendish, third son of the fourth Duke, has been Member of Parliament for the borough and county of Derby more than half a century, and has ever dis tinguished himself by his free and independent attachment to the liberties of the people. He succeeded his uncle, Lord John Cavendish, who died in December, 1796, as representative in Parliament for the county of Derby. He was created Earl of Burlington by his present Majesty, William IV. His Lordship's eldest son was unfortunately killed by a fall from his carriage about 18 years ago, leaving three children ; of whom the eldest, William Lord Cavendish, after having attained the highest academical honours at Cambridge, was, in testimony of his capacity and ac quirements, chosen Member of Parliament for that University in the year 1829 ; and soon after wards espoused Lady Blanche Howard, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle. In 1831 his Lordship"], [316, "288 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER was chosen Member of Parliament for the county of Derby, in the place of his grandfather. Colonel Cavendish, third son of Lord George Cavendish, has been many years Member of Par liament for the borough of Derby. The present illustrious possessor of the Dukedom is His Grace William Spencer, the sixth Duke and the ninth Earl of Devonshire. Endowed with a mind liberal and comprehensive, His Grace has devoted his princely revenues to the patronage of the fine arts, to the encouragement of literature, and to that splendid yet judicious style of living that renders the luxuries and em bellishments of society the channels of public benefit. His establishment is numerous and elegant as becomes his rank, and his entertainments bespeak at once his magnificence, his taste and his benevolence. Among his dependants and his tenantry, an affectionate attachment to His Grace is every where apparent, and in the public estimation no nobleman of the present day stands more secure. His Grace has not taken any prominent position in the conduct of public affairs, but whenever important occurrences have demanded his attention, he has ever been found in his place in the House of Peers, or offering his patriotic counsels to his Sovereign. On all occasions when his sentiments have been called forth, they have been found to be those of a clear-minded philan thropic statesman, earnest rather than ardent, having for their object the practical blessings of national liberty and greatness. Enjoying the personal esteem and friendship of George IV. His Grace has never permitted the tenor of his political principles to swerve from that high and hereditary determination which influenced his illustrious ancestor at the period ofthe Revolution of 1688, to vindicate the claims of civil and religious liberty ; and, hence, with sincere and grate ful attachment to the Sovereign, His Grace on his taking his seat in the Upper House, hesitated not to oppose the measures of those servants of the Crown, who, at that period, seemed to endea vour rather to stifle than to alleviate the complaints of a distressed people. His Grace has always supported the cause of humanity, justice and popular rights; and even when, in one great and particular instance, the sensibilities of the Sovereign himself were excited, the noble Duke fearlessly espoused the cause of the insulted and the persecuted, with that intrepidity of rectitude which secures admiration even in the quarter where it seems most to offend. Such generous conduct abated not the favour and regard of his Majesty towards his Grace, and, on the accession of the Emperor Nicholas to the throne of Russia, the noble Duke was nominated to the embassy of congratulation from the British court to that of St. Petersburg. The splendour and magnificence displayed by His Grace on this occasion, combined costliness with elegance, and surpassed as well in taste as in dignity all previous embassies of a similar character. His Grace was received not only with royal favour, but with the intimacy of princely friendship by the new emperor, and invested by him with the highest order of Russian Knighthood. \u2014 On the return of his Grace to England, he was distinguished by the favour and confidence of his late Majesty ; and the sudden illness of the Earl of Liverpool rendering a change in the administra tion necessary, his Grace was nominated to select, conciliate and arrange a ministry, in the forma tion of which all the remains of party spirit might be lost in a general devotion of the members to the interests of the public. The period was favourable for the dissolution of all party dis tinction, and although fatal and unforeseen events have diminished, in some degree, the effect of the noble Duke's patriotic efforts, still the measures of the state council have taken a more liberal direction and have had a more decided tendency to those principles of civil and religious liberty which it has ever been the object of the illustrious Duke and his ancestors to promote. His Grace is Lord High Chamberlain to William IV. ; Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum ofthe County of Derby ; High Steward of the Borough of Derby ; Lessee under the Crown of the mineral duties in the High Peak ; Lord of the following manors, and patron of the following church livings in the county of Derby :"], [317, "289 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY.

S. from Derby and 4 m. N. from Melboum. In 1821, this village contained 64 houses, 64 families and 202 inhabitants, who were chiefly employed in agriculture and in the gypsum quarries and brick-yards. The houses are now increased to 74, and the inhabitants to 352. The township is bounded by Aston, E. ; Boulton, N. N. E. ; Sinfin Moor, N. ; Swarkstone, S. S. W. \u2022 and Weston, S. S. E. The extent is about 890 acres of good com land, being chiefly a marl sub- stratum, under which the beautiful alabaster is procured; many thousand tons of this article are conveyed by the canal which runs through the township to the Staffordshire potteries and to various parts of the kingdom. The average rental is about 30s. per acre. The land is divided between twenty proprietors, viz. Sir George Crewe, bart. 300 acres; the late Mr. William Orton, 80 acres ; Mr. George Wotton, 60 acres; the perpetual Curate, in lieu of tithes, 54 acres; (the principal alabaster quarries are in the lands of the above four proprietors) Mr. William Soar, 150 acres ; Rev. Joseph Sykes, of Newark, 30 acres ; Messrs. Thomas Browne Dummelow, 46 acres ; George Newton, 28 acres ; Luke Pym, 36 acres ; William Manful, 18 acres and a corn mill ; Joseph Soar, 8 acres ; Samuel Rose, 8 acres ; Robert Forman, 5 acres ; John Warren, 4 acres ; Francis Astill, of Swarkstone, 1 6 acres ; John Bentley of Swarkstone, 5 acres, and four small proprietors. The land was enclosed under an Act of Parliament in 1802, since which the drainage act has been obtained. The estimated annual value ofthe land and buildings is <\u00a3l307. 10*. lOd. The average of seven years' parochial expenses is \u00a3123. 4s. 6d. The highways have averaged \u00a344. is. for the last three years, and the church-rates \u00a314. 7*- The parishioners con tribute to the House of Industry at Shardlow. There is one sick-club of 60 members, one Wes levan Methodist Chapel, and one Sunday-school at the church, the latter is maintained by volun tary contributions. The inhabitants pay a chief rent of 6s. Sd. to the Tutbury court, which is held at Sudbury. The Marquess of Hastings holds a court-leet annually at Melboum for this township. There is a lane, leading from Chellaston to the London road, called No Man's Lane, from the circumstance of there being upwards of 100 yards in length, not owned or repaired by any parish, which is almost impassable, except in very fine weather.

Nottingham, and Idonea, his wife, claimed William Chelardeston's lands, Joan, his wife's lands, here and elsewhere. Idonea, we suppose, was daughter and heir to Chelardeston. King John granted to Hugh de Beauchamp the manor of Melbourn, together with a carucate of land thercto belonging, at Chellaston, which land the said Hugh gave, in marriage with his daughter, to William Fitz Geoffry. In 4 Edward I. William de Frescheville held two-thirds and William de Bredon one-third of the said land, which was then said to be in the wapentake of Litchurch. In 36 Henry III. that king granted to Ralf de Frescheville free warren in several manors, and amongst them that of Chellaston is included. Witnesses to this charter are Roger de Lokington, Ralf de Bakepuize, &c. In 1307, Robert de Holland had a grant of the manor of Chellaston. In 1499) William Ashby, esq. died, and left this manor to his son William, under the honour of Tutbury. About this time and before, the Dean and Canons of the Newark College, in Leices ter, held lands here, which probably were given to them by the founder, Henry, Duke of Lancas ter, about the middle of the reign of Edward III. After the dissolution of abbeys, 32 Henry VIII. Christopher Hunt, esq. was possessed of it, and left it to his son Thomas. In 2 Edward VI. Rowland Babington, esq. held lands here, under the honour of Tutbury, which he left to his grandson Francis, as did Sir Henry Sacheverell, who, dying, 5 or 6 Philip and Mary, left his es tates to his son John. In 16 Elizabeth, Sir Richard Harpur, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, held lands here, and left them to his son John, which lands are still in the possession of their descendant, Sir George Crewe, bart. The Earl of Huntingdon sold the manor-house and a con siderable estate to a family of the name of Whinyates, who afterwards re-sold it in parcels ; when the manor-house and about 80 acres of land became the property of Mr. W*right. Mr. Orton, of Derby, having purchased the same from the Wright family, said that the Earl of Huntingdon conveyed the manorial rights with the estate; that he possessed the original deeds to that effect, and he considered himself clearly entitled to the manorial rights. The Marquess of Hastings still enjoys them, by inheritance from the Earls of Huntingdon. Chellaston was part of the rectory of Melbourn, and belonged to the bishops of Carlisle ; it had been a considerable time on lease to the family of Coke before it was enfranchised by an Act of Parliament, in 1704. Lord Melbourne, the representative ofthe Coke family, has sold the great tithes to the several proprietors, and, at the time of the enclosure, in 1 802, an allotment was awarded to the curate in lieu of the small tithes. The living is a perpetual curacy, now worth \u00a3100. per annum, including the rental ofthe plaster pits on the estate. The bishop of Carlisle is the patron, and the Rev. Joseph Dean is the incumbent. The ancient church, dedicated to St. Peter, formerly belonged to Dale Abbey. On the south side ofthe chancel, in a small compartment, there is a mutilated figure ofthe Virgin -Mary, with the infant Jesus on her knee. A handsome silver waiter and cup was given to the church by Mr. Benjamin Day, of London, mercer, in memory of his father, Mr. John Day, of the city of Norwich, woolfactor, who was born at Chellaston, and raised himself, by a life of industry and prudence, from a low estate in life to honour and opulence. His arms and crest are engraven on the plate. Monumental Inscriptions in the Church. On the north side of the chancel, on an alabaster slab, a cross store., with the sacramental cup on one side and the book of holy writ on the other, with the date of 1405 engraven thereon.

We find them on the first page ofthe first register, in 1570. From this family descended the celebrated Poet. The present descendants are now resident at Sinfin and Barrow, and are considerable freeholders. The most ancient yeoman families now resident at Chellaston are Soar, Meakin, Forman, Wotton, Rose, Glover, and Dummelow.

CHELMORTON, a village, township, constabulary and parochial chapelry, in the parish of Chelmerton, Bakewell, in the hundred of High Peak. This village is situate at the foot of a high eminence, nearly 2 m. to the E. of the Buxton road, and 4 m. S. from Buxton, which is the post town. On the summit of the hill, east of the village, are two considerable barrows within a short distance from each other, one called Chelmorton-low, which we have described at page 237, in the first Part; the other near the Five Wells farm house, in Taddington liberty. In 1831, the number of houses were 53, occupied by 53 families, and 268 inhabitants. Of the families, 23 are chiefly employed in agriculture, 17 in trades or handicraft, and 13 variously connected therewith. The township of Flagg is in this chapelry. The extent of the township is 1888 a. 2 r. of limestone land, at an average rental of 25*. per acre : about one-sixth of the land is arable, the remaining five-sixths is meadow and pasture ; watered by a powerful and never-failing spring, that runs down the village and sinks into the earth a little below it. The commons in Chelmorton and Flagg were enclosed under one Act, in 1805, at which time an allotment of land was given in lieu of the great and small tithes. His Grace the Duke of Devonshire had awarded to him in lieu of the great tithes, 175 a. 0 r. 32 p.; and the perpetual curate, in lieu of the small, 59 a. 2 r. 36 p. ; and 8 a. 3 r. 23 p. is appropriated to keep a bull for the benefit of the inhabitants. Priestcliffe School land, in this township, is 65 a. 2r. 24/>. : the other proprietors are, Messrs. George Percival, George Holme, John Bateman, Michael Simpson, Thomas Buxton, of the Flatt, Thomas Buxton, of Chelmorton, Thomas Ben nett, and John Hodgkinson, are freeholders of above \u00a310. a year; Joseph, Alexander, and Exu perius Olerenshaw, William, and Anthony Holme, George Bennett, Thomas Goyte, and James Smith, are freeholders of above \u00a32. a year. The estimated annual value of the buildings and land is \u00a31772. 19*. 2 d. The average of eight years' parochial expenses is \u00a3117. Qs. per annum. The poor are maintained at home. There are a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, a Presbyterian chapel, a parochial endowed day-school, a Sunday-school, supported by voluntary contributions, and two public houses in the township. The township is esteemed parcel of the king's manor of High Peak, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. The Talbot family had a subordinate manor in Chelmorton in the reign of Eliza beth, in which they were succeeded by the Eyres of Hassop : it is now the property of the Earl of Newburgh. The ancient tower church is supposed to have been built in the year 1111, having that date on an oak beam. In 1282, the revenue of this chapel was estimated at twenty marks; two parts belonged to the priory of Lenton, in Nottinghamshire, and the remainder to the Dean and Chap ter of Lichfield. The prior and the dean and chapter were bound to provide, jointly, books and ornaments for the chapel ; and thS dean and chapter a priest, with a stipend of five marks. It is a peculiar in the Deanery and Chapter of Lichfield. The font is octagon, with a Greek capital raised letter on each of the squares. In this church are the remains also of a rood loft or other screen work. The interior of the church is much neglected, and wants new paving and new seating.

Of the families, 396 are chiefly employed in agriculture, 1175 in trade and manufacture, and 1371 not included in the two preceding classes, are employed in the extensive collieries, ironstone pits, &c. Besides the townships and chapelries enumerated above, there are the following villages and places within the parish, viz. Ashgate, Birley, Boythorp, Grass-moor, Hady, Hallclift. Holy moor-side, Loads, Moorhay, New Brampton, Platt hall, part of Stanage, Spital, Stubbing, Sum mersall, Swathwick, Wadshelf, Wigley, Wildens mill, &c. It appears by the Chantry Roll that there were in the parish of Chesterfield, in 1547, about 2000 persons of sixteen years of age (called at that period Howselyng people, of an age to be ad mitted to receive the communion.) In the month of December, 1788, the town was found, by an actual enumeration, to contain 801 houses, and 3626 inhabitants. In 1801, there were 893 houses, and in 1811, 951 houses; the number of inhabitants will be found in the columns. Of the 2491 families (according to the returns made in 1821) 417 were chiefly employed in agricul ture, 1002 in trade or handicraft, and 1072 variously. The neighbourhood of Chesterfield produces excellent coals, ironstone, potters' and brick clay, &c. consequently the procuring the coal, ironstone and clay, the furnaces, founderies and potteries connected therewith, furnish employment for a great number of the inhabitants. Next to Derby, Chesterfield is the most considerable trading town in the county. The manufactures are silk, cotton-wick, hats, ginghams and checks, ropes and sacks, snuff, tobacco, and tobacco pipes, cot ton and worsted hosiery, cotton and woollen gloves, bobbin-net lace, leather, &c. The gloves netted here with one needle (termed pegging by the operative) are expeditiously made, neat in appearance, and durable in wear. The art of making this description of gloves was first intro duced by the French prisoners, of which there were about two hundred at a time stationed here, between the years 1804 and 1814, 011 their parole of honour, during the late war with France. The excellency and neatness of these gloves soon found a market; and the great demand there has since been for them, has given employment to numerous hands, and the town has been bene fited by it. Many young females are employed in figuring the bobbin-net lace manufactured here, at Nottingham, and at Derby. Extensive bleach yards and the making business are also carried on. Some years ago carpets were manufactured at Chesterfield, but no fabric of this kind is now made. Its early importance as a place of trade may be inferred from the fact of a guild of merchants, possessing ample privileges, having been established in 1204. \u2022 Commons unenclosed not included. + Waste not included. .*\u00a3 Roads not included. \u00a7 Brampton (including Cutthorpe) and Wingerworth are considered distinct parishes.

King John, by his charter of 1204, granted a weekly market at Chesterfield on Saturday, and a fair for eight days, at the festival of the Holy Rood. The market continues to be held on Sat urday, for corn (particularly wheat and oats) and all kinds of provisions. The Quo Warranto Boll of 1330 mentions the Holy Rood fair, and another on the eve of Palm Sunday. The charter of 1631 grants four fairs ; February 28; May 4, for two days; July 4 ; and September 14, for eight days. The fairs in January, April, and November, were first estab lished in the year 1750. The present annual fairs are held on the 27th January (toll free) 28th February, and first Saturday in April, for horses and horned cattle, 4th May, for cattle, &c. (pleasure fair) 4th July, for cattle and pedlery, 25th September (old fair) for cattle, cheese, onions, &c. (pleasure fair) and 25th November, or the last Saturday in November, for horses, horned cattle, &c. (statute fair, toll free). Most of these fairs are frequented by the Yorkshire clothiers. A market is held every Christmas eve. The increasing market has induced the inhabitants to take down a range of buildings that separated the market-place from the new square, and circumscribed its means of accommodation. The two openings being thrown together, renders the market-place one of the most commodious in the kingdom, for the extent and population of the town. The town is well built ; the houses are chiefly of red brick, made in the neighbourhood ; and within a few years great improvements have been made in its internal appearance and arrange ments. The town is well supplied with fuel, but wholesome water was long a desideratum. Previously to the establishment of the Water Company, the inhabitants were supplied, by means of carts, from springs strongly impregnated with the properties of minerals that abound in the neighbourhood, and consequently prejudicial to health. The Company have at great expense brought an abundant supply of excellent water to the town by means of pipes, perfectly free from the deleterious properties alluded to, from Holme brook, about two miles westward. Com modious baths have been erected ; the hot baths are heated to any required temperature. An Act of Parliament was obtained, in 1825, to light the town with gas. All these improvements must prove highly advantageous, and eminently conducive to the happiness and prosperity of this increasing manufacturing town. The sombre aspect which it presented for many years, was a theme of reproach with most travellers who happened to pass through in the dark months of winter, but its streets may now be perambulated at evening with pleasure and safety. Many genteel families reside in the borough and parish of Chesterfield. Chesterfield has possessed a respectable weekly newspaper since January, 1828; and likewise the Derby and Chesterfield Reporter has a publisher in this town. The amusements are races, held annually about the latter end of October or the beginning of November. An elegant and commodious stand has been recently built by subscription. The theatre is neat and well fitted up. The interesting company of Mr. Manly attends regu larly. The assemblies are held monthly during the winter season, in the assembly-room at the Angel Inn. A large bowling-green has been opened by Mr. Pindar, for the pleasant and healthful ex ercise of the lovers of that pastime. The same spirited landlord keeps a billiard-table for the accommodation of his customers. Public Bui/dings The present town hall was built by the Duke of Portland, under the direc tion of Mr. Carr, of York, in the years 1787-8. It is a handsome and convenient edifice. The Midsummer sessions are held, and the public business of the town is transacted in it. The ground floor is converted into a jail for debtors, and a residence for the jailer. The house of correction"], [325, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 297 is an ancient building, in a low damp situation, almost the worst that could be found for such a purpose.

Sitwell Sir George, bart. non-resident, Tomlinson Richard, painter, Chesterfield is supposed by Dr. Pegge to have originated in a Roman station, on the road to Derby and York. The name, according to the opinion of other antiquarians, imports that it had been the site of an ancient castle. In the Doomsday Survey Cestrefold is described as a hamlet of Newbold, which was an ancient demesne of the crown. The manor was given by William the Conqueror to his natural son, William Peverel. William, his grandson, or great-grandson (for historians disagree upon this point) having fled the kingdom for the crime we have alluded to under Castleton, the king (Henry II.) seized this and his other estates. In 1204, king John granted the manor of Chesterfield, in the county of Derby, with Brimington and Whittington, and the whole wapentake of Scarsdale, in fee farm, to his favourite, William Briwere, on the yearly payment for the manors of Chesterfield, Brimington and Whit tington, with the soke, \u00a369. ; and for the wapentake of Scarsdale, \u00a310. ; and that the manor of Chesterfield should have the same liberties as the borough of Nottingham enjoyed. By the same grant he had likewise the manor of Snotinton (Nottingham) in the county of Nottingham, and Axeminster, in the county of Devon, paying yearly for Nottingham \u00a38. and for Axminster \u00a324. And that he should have a fair at Chesterfield every year, for eight days, beginning upon the Exaltation of the Holy Cross ; as also a market for two days every week, viz. Tuesday and Sat urday, with free fishing in Kingsmere, county of Somerset, in fee farm also for \u00a320. per annum. This William Briwere (or Brievere) built the castle at Bridgewater, which town he obtained as the gift of Fulk Paganel : he also got a license from king John to enclose his woods at Toare, Cade legh, Raddon, Ailesbury and Burg- Walter (Bridgewater) with free liberty to hunt the hare, fox, cat and wolf throughout all Devonshire, and likewise the goat, out of the regard of the forest ; and to have free warren throughout all his own lands, for hares, pheasants and partridges. He had a previous ample charter granted in the second year ofthe reign of John, for his lordship of Bridgewater, viz. That it should be a free borough ; and to have a free market there every week, a fair once a year, and other privileges, as the benefit of toll and passage, and that the burgesses should be free of soke, &c. giving him license to build three castles ; one in Hampshire, at Eslege or Stoke, one at Bridgewater, and a third in Devonshire, wherever he thought fit. King John, in the fifth year of his reign, gave him ten knights' fees in Cornwall, which Nicholas de Middle ton formerly held. He founded the hospital of St. John, at Bridgewater, for the health of the souls of king Henry II. king Richard I. and king John ; for thirteen poor people, besides religious and strangers. We have noticed this William as being a castellan of Bolsover castle, in the sixth year of the reign of king John. He died, according to Leland, 1 1 Henry III. and was buried at Dunkeswelle,"], [327, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 299 an abbey of white monks of his foundation, in Devonshire, leaving issue by Beatrix de Valle, his wife (who was buried at Monlesfonle, a priory of her husband's foundation) one son, William, and five daughters. William, the son, according to Leland, founded the priory of grey friars at Bridge water, and died, 1232, without issue, when his five sisters became his co-heirs, viz. Grecia, wife of Reginald de Braose; Margaret, wife of William de Ferte; Isabel, first wife of Dovre, and second of Baldwin Wake ; Alice, wife of Reginald de Mohun ; Joane, wife of William de Percy. Bridgewater castle passed to Margaret, and from her to her daughter Gundred, wife of Pain de Chaworth, and from him to Henry, Duke of Lancaster, who married Mary, daughter and heir of Sir Patric Chaworth, afterwards to the Cantilupes, descended from Grecia de Braose, and from them to the Zouches. On a partition of the estates, the manors of Chesterfield, Brimington and Whittington fell to Isabel, the wife of Baldwin Wake, from which family it passed by an heir female, viz. Margaret Wake, to Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Kent, whose descendants inherited several generations. In 26 Edward III. it was held by John, second son of Edmund, of Woodstock, grandson of Ed ward I. In 1385, Ralph de Frescheville held lands in Chesterfield. In the time of Richard I. Alan of Cumberland was lord of the manor; and in 1386, Sir Thomas Holland held it, from whom it passed, in 1442, to Richard Nevile, Earl of Salisbury, who, according to Lysons, became possessed of the manor in right of Alice, his wife, one of the co-heiresses of Earl Edmund. In 1472, an act of parliament passed, by which the castle of Scarborough, with lands in Yorkshire, were given to Anne, Duchess of Gloucester, one of the co-heiresses of Richard, the succeeding Earl of Salisbury, in exchange for the manor of Chesterfield. It appears, nevertheless, that it was afterwards possessed by Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, daughter and heiress of Isabel, Duchess of Clarence, sister to the Duchess of Gloucester ; and that she gave it to George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, in exchange for other lands. According to the inquisition taken after the death of George, Earl of Shrewsbury (18th of November, 1591) bearing date 13th of April, 1592, it appears that he died seised of Chesterfield, Scarsdale, com.

William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle, afterwards Duke, purchased this manor of the Shrewsbury family. Having de scended in the same manner as Bolsover to the late Duke of Portland, it was, together with the hundred of Scarsdale, exchanged by his son, the present Duke, in 1792, for estates in Notting hamshire, with the late Duke of Devonshire, and they are now vested in William Spencer Cav endish, the present Duke. A court of record is held under the authority of the Lord of the Manor, for the recovery of debts not exceeding \u00a320. The Stanhopes derive their title of Earl of Chesterfield from this town. Philip, Lord Stan hope, of Shelford, in Nottinghamshire, was created Earl of Chesterfield in the fourth year of king Charles the First. The title has been continued in the same family down to the present time. An account of which family will be found under the head Bretby. King John's charter, before mentioned, made Chesterfield a free borough, and granted that the burgesses should have the same privileges which were enjoyed by those of Nottingham, which succeeding monarchs have confirmed and enlarged. Prior to 1598, the governing body consisted of an alderman and twelve brethren ; but by the charter of queen Elizabeth, granted in that year, and confirmed subsequently by that of Charles II. the civil power was entrusted to a mayor, justice, six aldermen, six brethren, and twelve capital burgesses, or common councilmen, assisted by a town clerk, a chamberlain, a master butcher, a master brazier, and other officers. The mayor is chosen by the whole corporation, on the Sunday next before Michaelmas day ; who, with the preceding mayor, are justices of the peace; but the county magistrates possess concurrent jurisdiction, al-"], [328, "300 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER though, from courtesy, they seldom exercise it. The duty of the master butcher is to inspect meat brought to the market; and that ofthe master brazier is to examine and adjust the weights and measures : these officers are elected annually.

A court leet is held in October by the Lord of the Manor, at which the constable and headboroughs for the town are chosen and sworn in. There are but few historical events connected with this town. In 1266, a battle was fought here between Henry, nephew of Henry III. and Robert de Ferrers, the last Earl of Derby, of that family, Baldwin Wake, Lord of Chesterfield, John d'Egville, and others. They assembled a numerous force in the vicinity of Duffield, about i\\ miles from Derby, marched to Chesterfield, and took up a military post there, with the hope of having their little army increased by the ac- cession of some of those rebellious barons and their followers, who, in the preceding year, had been beaten and dispersed at Evesham. Their dreams of success were, however, soon over. They had scarcely established themselves in the neighbourhood of the town when they were at- tacked by Henry, the eldest son of the king of Almaine. This rebel army was soon beaten, and the greater part of them were put to the sword. The Earl of Derby himself took refuge in the church, and sought a hiding-place amongst some bags of wool that had been deposited there. A woman in whom he had confided pointed out the place of his concealment to his pursuers, and he was taken prisoner. Several of the knights and barons made their escape into the forest of the Peak, where they continued for two years leading a predatory life, closely hemmed around with danger, and subjected to continual alarm. Robert de Ferrers, the principal in this mad scheme, was conveyed to Windsor in irons, and detained a prisoner for many years. He was at length set at liberty, but his estates were confiscated, and he was ultimately deprived of the earldom of Derby. In this borough, Mr. Eaton Wood, and afterwards his son, Richard Wood, who were both apothecaries, coined money amongst others; and on the death of the late Mr. Edward Wood, son ofthe said Richard, the dies and press were found in the house, whence we may be enabled to comprehend the whole process, which may be presumed not to be very intricate. These Woods coined only halfpennies. There were two sets of dies, one for the father's, and one for the son's money. Being apothecaries, they had for their devise Apollo Opifer. The late Dr. Pegge pur- chased one set of these dies, viz. an obverse and reverse; these, he says, were cut on two small pieces of steel, which were afterwards welded upon a larger block of iron. The press consisted of four pieces of oak about four inches thick and strongly dovetailed together. In an upper cross piece was fastened an iron box with a female screw, through which passed a stout iron screw of an inch or more in diameter, to the bottom of which was fixed one of the dies; whilst the other was received into a square hole made in the bottom cross piece, where it lay very steady, as in a"], [330, "302 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER proper bed. The screw was wrought by the hand, in the manner of a capstan, by means of four handles affixed to the top of it, about nine inches long each, and thus, after the copper was reduced to a proper thickness, shorn to a size, and commodiously rounded, many hundreds of halfpence might be coined by two persons in a very short time ; viz. by a man to ply the screw, and a woman or boy to put on and take off the piece ; yet these Chesterfield halfpennies were remark ably well struck. Gentleman's Magazine, 1757- Eminent Natives. \u2014 The venerable Dr. Pegge, the well known antiquary, author of the Lives of Bishop Grossetette, and his friend, Roger de Weseham, the History of Beauchief Abbey, of Bolsover and Peak Castles, several Treatises on Coins, and other antiquarian subjects, was born at Chesterfield in 1704, preached the centenary sermon in commemoration of the Revolution, at Whittington church, of which he was rector, in 1788, and died in 1796. Samuel Hallifax, bishop of St. Asaph, and numerous other persons of the families of Heathcote, Milnes, Bright, Youle, Webster, &c. have been eminent for learning and benevolence, as will be seen on reference to the Biography, and the Chesterfield Charities and Church Notes. There was an ancient hospital of lepers at Old Spital, near Chesterfield, dedicated to St. Leonard, which existed before 1195, when a rent charge of \u00a36. per annum, payable out of the manor, was assigned to the brethren in lieu of their fair. The patronage of this hospital was annexed to the manor. John, Earl of Kent, held it in capite 26 Edward III. but in 9 Richard II. it was seised by Joan, princess of Wales. In 1507, Henry VII. granted it for life to John Blythe; but Mar garet, Countess of Salisbury, seised it as an appendage to the manor. In 1547, Francis, Earl of Shrewsbury, claimed it on the same grounds. Spital is half a mile from Chesterfield, near the river Rother. This place formerly belonged to the Jenkinsons, and was sold by the co-heiresses of Woodyear to the late Sir Thomas Windsor Hunloke, bart. The house was many years occupied by the Bourne family, and now by John Charge, esq. clerk of the peace for the county, who married one of the daughters of the Rev. John Bourne. There were formerly two chantries and a guild belonging the church of Chesterfield: the chantry of St. Michael, founded in the year 1357 by Roger de Chesterfield ; the revenues of which were valued, in 1547, at \u00a3ll. 7*- 3d. per annum; and the chantry of the Holy Cross, founded by Hugh Draper, and valued at \u00a310. 6s. 8d.; and the guild of the aldermen, brethren, and sisters of the Virgin Mary and the Holy Cross, endowed in 1392, by Thomas Dur and others, and valued, in 1547, at \u00a315. 10.. per annum. There were formerly three chapels in Chesterfield : one, dedicated to St. Thomas, in Holy well street, the remains of which form part of a barn and stable, which is the property of Mrs. Ph\u0153be Taylor : another, dedicated to St. Helen, which, after the reformation, was appropriated to the use of the school; and a third, dedicated to St. James, at the Lordsmill bridge, but of which there are now no traces. There was a church here in the eleventh century. William Rufus gave the church at Chester field, with its chapels, to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln; and about the year 1100, it was ap propriated to the Dean and his successors. Ever since that time the Deans of Lincoln have been Lords of the rectorial manor, appropriators of the great tithes, and patrons of the vicarage. The rectorial manor and great tithes are rented by the Duke of Devonshire, on a lease for three lives. His Grace receives about \u00a31200. per annum. It is generally supposed that the present church was built in the beginning of the thirteenth century. In Doomsday Book it is said that Matthew Hathersage gave six acres of land, in Newbold field, to the church at Chesterfield, on the day of dedication, in the year 1233. Godfrey Foljambe, of Walton, who died in 1595, bequeathed a rent charge of \u00a340. per annum, as the endowment of a lectureship at Chesterfield, the patronage of which he vested in the Archbishop of York. The present lecturer is the Rev. Thomas Hill. The church is a spacious and very handsome gothic structure, in the cathedral form, being that of the cross.

From the middle a massy tower rises, adorned with pinnacles and double"], [331, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 303 windows, terminated by a tall spire of timber, covered with lead, which, from its remarkable construction, has a leaning appearance. It has been the cause of various opinions, and innumera ble arguments have been advanced for and against it being in a perpendicular position. The Rev. Mr. Hall says, the action of the sun on the west side has caused the timber to shrink on that side, and to force it out on the contrary direction. Mr. Wilson, cabinet maker, of Chesterfield, who has minutely examined, and made a model of it, says, one of the upright beams, of which there are four, being drawn out of its tenon, has shrunk several inches, which has caused the spire to have the singular leaning appearance, which now arrests the attention of every traveller who approaches it. Being in conversation with an architect of some eminence on the subject, he informed us he had plumbed the spire from the base to the vane, and had tried it in every possi ble shape, and found it to be perfectly upright. The fluting or volutes that run up the spire from the base to the top, and the manner in which the lead is laid on, undoubtedly deceive the eye. The height, from the ground to the vane, is 230 feet. The nave rests on six pointed arches on clustered columns ; the centre arches on four clustered columns. The choir is handsomely pewed; and there are two large galleries, and an excellent organ. The steeple contains 10 mu sical bells. This church is dedicated to All Saints. The living is a vicarage. Its value, in the king's books, is \u00a315. Os. 2|t.. and yearly tenths \u00a3l. 10_. O^d.

What renders it worthy of remark is, the person's head appears to have been shot off entirely from the mouth upwards, and the helmet lightly placed on the remaining part, which has a very odd appearance. There is no memorial for whom it is intended to represent. In the chancel are three altar tombs of the ancient family of Foljambe, who formerly resided at Walton, in Jacobo Foljambe equiti aurato Filio natu maximo et H\u00e6redi Godefridi Foljambe equitis, Pietate, morum in tegritate, majorum Stemmatibus, propriisque suis vir tutibus, ornatissimo viro.

Besides the Foljambe altar tombs is a large rib, sup posed to be the rib of a mammoth, which has been de posited here from time immemorial, and no history or account remains of it. Its length, when measured on the outward side, is 7 feet 4 inches, and when measured straight across, 5 feet 7 inches. Its circumference varies from 12 to 13 inches. Near one end of it is engraven, in Old English characters, \" CfjamaS JfitttfytX'.\" hence it is supposed to have belonged to the family of Fletchers who succeeded the Foljambes at Walton, and to have been deposited here about the year 1650. \u2014 A similar rib may be seen at Warwick castle. In the south aisle of the nave, between the first and second window from the east, with arms and crest in the south wall, is a stone figure of a Priest, and the following inscription, as far as it could be read : \u2014 No bowbrdys Godfray ffols B. In the south aisle is a slab with a triple cross, on steps between a hammer and pincers. In the north transept, cut in freestone, on an altar tomb, are the figures of a man and his wife entire ; the principal of the inscription is effaced, the only remains being, Burgensis de Chesterfield, 1599. On the north side of the altar rails is the burial place of the Heathcotes, the munificent benefactors to Ches terfield, and against the wall is the following inscription. At the foot of this, here lieth in hopes of a blessed re surrection, the body of Gilbert Heathcote, late of this town, gentleman, who departed this life the 24th of April, 1690, in the 65th year of his age.

The first register of marriages, baptisms and burials, in Chesterfield church, begins in the month of Novem ber, 1558, in the seventeenth year of queen Elizabeth. In the register, in September, 1586, is the following memorandum : \" Here began the great plague in Chester field.\" From this time it appears by the register, that the number of deaths gradually increased, till June, 1587, when the number of burials in that month were 64, and in July 52. The number of burials then gradu ally decrease ; and in the succeeding winter it seems to have disappeared. Some idea of the appalling mortaUty that pervaded the town at this time may be formed, when it is known, that by the register, the number of funerals in the month of June, 1586 (the summer before the plague broke out) was only three, and in the next month (July) three: and in the June following, the summer after the plague, i. .. in 1588, only four ; and in July two. Hence it appears, that three funerals a month was the average number at this period, when no fever or epidemic was prevalent in the parish. On March 18, 1608-9, is this memorandum in the mar gin of the register : \" Here began the latter plague in Chesterfield.\" During the time of this plague it appears the greatest number of funerals were in the month of April, when eighteen were buried : in May, eight were buried : it then seems to have gradually subsided, and"], [338, "HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 310 it was probably on account of the plague, which, it ap pears by history, was prevalent at Derby at this time. There is no doubt but Brampton and Wingerworth were formerly chapelries in the parish of Chesterfield. At the end of the first register book in Chesterfield church is a memorandum, or an agreement in Latin (now scarcely legible) between Matthew Waddington, vicar of Chesterfield, and the inhabitants of Brampton and Win gerworth, wherein this Vicar consented to give up his patronage of these chapels, and allowed them respectively to christen, marry and bury thereat, on condition of their paying him a small acknowledgment yearly. This agree ment is dated November 11, 1634. the number of funerals to have sunk into the average of three a month. In the church register are the following memoranda in the margin. In the month of May, 1643, \" Newcastle forces came to Chesterfield.\" And in the November fol lowing, \" Newcastle army came into Derbyshire ye latter time.\" From this it is supposed that it was at one of these times, during the civil wars, that the action hap pened, in which the Earl of Newcastle is said to have de feated a body of the Parliamentary army near Chester field. \"The assizes were held here the 15th and lbth of March, 1637, and there suffered five men and one woman.\" The reason of their being held here is not mentioned, but The following is a Table of baptisms, burials and marriages, extracted from the registers at Chesterfield church, for the respective years mentioned : Baptisms.

The causeways therein contained ........ 788 square yards. Leaving for burying ground ......... 5077 square yards. Hence, if it be assumed that a grave takes up one square yard and a half, that is, six feet long and two feet three inches wide, which, on an average, is about the truth, it follows that the church yard is dug through every twenty-one years; there being 160 funerals in a year, which consume, at this rate, 240 yards yearly.

Free Grammar School. \u2014 By a Charter of queen Elizabeth, which was recited in, and confirmed by letters patent, bearing date 21st July, 32 Charles II. her Majesty constituted the borough of Chesterfield a free borough, and the burgesses and inhabitants of the town a body corporate, by the name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of Chesterfield, to consist of a mayor, six aldermen, and six brethren, to be chosen out of the capital burgesses of the said borough in the manner therein mentioned, and empowered the said mayor, aldermen, brethren and capital burgesses, or the greater part of them, of whom the mayor should be one, to make such laws and ordinances as should be necessary for the government of the borough, and the inhabitants thereof, and also for the government of a grammar school, thereafter to be erected, founded and estab- lished within the said borough, and of a master and usher of the same, and of the boys in the same school, thereafter to be educated ; and after reciting that Godfrey Foljambe, esquire, de- ceased, by his will, bearing date 24th February, 1594, had, among other things, willed and ap- pointed that Isabella, his wife, her heirs and assigns, should, after a certain time therein specified, pay an annual salary of \u00a340. for the maintenance of a preacher, as therein mentioned, and also an annual salary of \u00a3l3. 6s. 8d. for and towards the maintenance of a schoolmaster, for the edu- cation and instruction of boys in Chesterfield ; and that the burgesses and inhabitants of the borough, being desirous to keep with them, as well a venerable honest man to preach at Chester- field, as also to build, found ancl erect a grammar school within the borough, to be called the Free Grammar School of Chesterfield, to be governed by the mayor, aldermen, &c. for the time being, and also to have and receive to them and their successors, as well of her Majesty, her heirs and successors, as of William Bowes, knight, who had then married the aforesaid Isabella, or of other persons whatsoever, any manors, messuages, land and hereditaments, without special license, providing the same should not exceed the yearly value of \u00a3S0. A grammar school was established under the authority of the charter of queen Elizabeth ; and a school-house, with a garden and two closes, containing together between four and five acres, adjoining the town of Chesterfield, are supposed to have been appropriated at the time of the foundation, to the use of the master. The present school-house, which contains sufficient apart- ments for the master's residence, and for the accommodation of boarders, with a large school-room, appears, from an inscription over the entrance, to have been rebuilt by voluntary contributors thereto, in the year 1710.

The head master is appointed by the mayor and aldermen, subject to the approval of the Arch bishop of York (Godfrey Foljambe having, by his will, directed that the sum of \u00a313. 6s. 8d. per annum, should be paid to a schoolmaster, sufficiently learned, for teaching children, within the town of Chesterfield, such schoolmaster to be allowed and removed, if cause of his defects should so require, by the Archbishop of York ;) and to entitle the schoolmaster to the benefit of Clarke's augmentation, it is necessary that he should be also approved of by the Lord of the manor of Nor ton, being of kin to the said Cornelius Clarke, or at least that such Lord of the manor should have no just cause of exception against him. The appointment of the usher or under master is vested solely in Samuel Shore, esq. as Lord of the manor of Norton, and a descendant from Cornelius Clarke. In 1794, the Rev. Thomas Field, who had held the office of usher from 1~S8, was appointed head master, and from that time to the present he has held both offices. No rules or regulations appear to have been made, either for the government of the school, in pursuance of the powers vested in the mayor, aldermen and burgesses, by the charter of queen Elizabeth, or for the government of the usher, under the powers given by Cornelius Clarke, to the mayor and aldermen, together with the Lord ofthe manor of Norton, being of his kindred. The freedom of the school is not only open to such boys as are born within the town of Ches terfield, but is extended to other boys, if thought expedient, under the authority ofthe charter of queen Elizabeth, by which the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses are empowered to make laws and ordinances for the government of the school, and to order that the freedom of the school shall in future be extended to other boys, besides those born within the town of Chesterfield. This school was formerly a grammar school of some reputation, but of late years it seems to have been of little public benefit. At some periods, since the appointment of Mr. Field, there has been no scholars on the foundation, and in 1827, there were only five. From the evidence of Mr. Field, before the Commissioners, it appears that his attendance at the school never exceeds an hour and a half, or at the most two hours in the day, and that on two days in every week it does not exceed one hour ; that even such attendance is subject to interruptions by his parochial duties, as curate of Great Barlow and of Brimington, and other occasional engagements ; and it does not appear, that he has ever given a greater degree of attendance at any period since his appointment in 1 794. Therefore what parent would be induced to send their children to such a school. Natives of Chesterfield, after founder's kindred, have a preference for the scholarships and fellowships of Beresford's foundation, at St. John's College, Cambridge.

Out of the income of this charity, which amounted, in 1829, to \u00a393. 2s. l^d. per annum, the chamberlain pays \u00a330. to the Rev. T. Field, as the stipends of the head master and of the usher of the Grammar School ; he also pays 20.. a year to the poor. The yearly sum of \u00a330. is given to a schoolmistress for instructing in reading, writing and accounts, twenty poor children of the town of Chesterfield, who are appointed by the Corporation, she providing them with books. From the accounts, as stated in the Commissioners' Reports, it appears that there has been in every year, with a few exceptions, a considerable surplus of income beyond the expenditure. The amount of these balances, so applied by the Corporation to their own use, from 1799 to 1815 inclusive, after deducting the balance against the charities, in the years 1803 and 1804, appears to be \u00a3719- 15s. 7d.: exclusive of this balance, there is the following sums due to Clarke's charity.

Upon referring to the Deed of the 20th of May, I69O, it will be found that the object of Cor nelius Clarke, in providing for the maintenance of a Petty School, was to prepare scholars therein for the Grammar School, he having first given an increase to the stipends of the master and usher of the Grammar School. The object of John Bright, the elder, and John Bright, the younger, as appears from the Deed of 1738, was to teach ten children, boys and girls, to read English, The former charity, therefore, having been evidently intended for the advancement of the Gram mar School, it seems that a scheme for the application of the income of this charity, the effect of which would be, not only to supply such deficiencies as are found to exist in the system of education adopted in the Grammar School (without altering the character of that school, as a foundation for the instruction of boys) in classical knowledge, but also to establish a con venient and useful Petty School, would not be considered as a departure from the intent of that donor. The principal defects now existing in these establishments seem to be, that in the Grammar School there is no provision for teaching the scholars writing and arithmetic, and that there is no school room for the scholars under the petty master, and it is suggested, that these deficiencies might be supplied if a petty master were allowed to teach his scholars in the room appropriated to the use ofthe Grammar School, which is sufficiently large for the purpose of both schools, and if he were required to teach the grammar scholars writing and accounts. The income of Bright's charities, seem to be properly applicable to a school of an inferior de scription, in which girls as well as boys are admissible, and such a school may be carried on without much inconvenience arising from the want of a regular school room for the purpose. John Bright, the elder, and John Bright, the younger, by indenture, bearing date 24th Janu ary, 1738, gave to the Corporation of Chesterfield \u00a3100. which was laid out in lands at Ashover, and the said Corporation gave \u00a3100. to advance the said charity, and one moiety of the interest or clear rents and profits of such lands should be given to a sober master, that should be able to teach English well in a Petty School, for which the said master should well teach and instruct in the English tongue, ten children, boys or girls, or both, to be appointed and named by the mayor and aldermen, and their successors, and that they should apply and pay the other moiety of the said rents and profits, to such master teaching in such Petty School, as should in like manner in struct ten such other children as the said mayor and aldermen should nominate ; provided, never theless, that the said mayor and aldermen, and their successors, might at any time thereafter withdraw the yearly payment of the said last mentioned moiety, and apply the same to any other uses.

The Tapton branch became extinct early in the last century, the estates falling to co-heiresses, who married into the families of Revel and Brailssord, of Chesterfield. In the branch descended from Richard Milnes, we find the celebrated Dr. Milnes, who, by his mother's side, was nephew to Seeker, Archbishop of Canterbury, a prelate highly distinguished in the annals of the Church. He died without pro geny, and was succeeded in his estates by his niece, the wife of William Waller, of Chesterfield, esq. Three other branches are now represented by the Lowndes, of Hampstead, near London ; the Oates, of Low Hall, near Leeds ; and the Boroughs, of Chetwynd Park, Shropshire. The Yorkshire branch derives its descent from Richard Milnes, of Chesterfield, who died in 1706, a younger brother of William Milnes, of Tapton Hall, esq. The representative of this branch is Sir Robert Shore Milnes, created a baronet in 1801, of Galfrey, Leicestershire. Pedigree of the family of BURTON, of Chesterfield, Dronfield, fye. ARMS of Burton.

Mr. Richard Calton, of Chesterfield, attorney at Law, is the representative of the junior branch of the ancient family of that name, long resident at Calton, in the parish of Bakewell, and of Edensor. The family sold the Calton estate to the Countess of Shrewsbury, in the reign of queen Elizabeth. This family is mentioned in the list of gentry in the reign of Henry VI. ; they were then of Edensor. The junior branch, which settled at Chesterfield some generations ago, was a family of some consequence ; for there is a chapel in the church which still bears their name. The representative of the elder branch is said to be a clerk in some office in Manchester. His father formerly kept one of the principal Inns in Derby; and his grandfather sold the remains of the family estate in Darley Dale. John Calton, of Stanton by Yolgrave, gent, was possessed of an estate there. Richard Calton, his eldest son and heir, was an eminent attorney at Chester- field; he made his will 17th August, 1751. and died 17th May, 1756. By Helena, his wife, he had three daughters and two sons: viz. Elizabeth, married Gervase Gardener; Hellen, died un married September 1, 1778, aged 75; Anne, married Mr. William Manley, an eminent attorney at Chesterfield ;* Richard, of Chesterfield, gent, eldest son and heir, died April 3, 1758; and * The following will show in a striking and forcible manner the vicissitudes in human life. *\" Died in the workhouse of the parish of Chesterfield, county of Derby, December 5, 1804, aged 73, Mr. William Manley, who formerly practised there as an eminent Attorney and Solicitor, and was esteemed, employed, and visited"], [356, "328 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Thomas, of same place, gent, his brother and heir, died May 17, 1784, aged 77 ; and by Eliza beth, his wife, had a son, Richard, of Dronfield, in 1788, and then described as nephew and devisee of the above Richard, of the Cow Close farm, about 46 acres, in Stanton. This gentleman died in 1795. His son, Mr. Richard Calton, attorney at law, now resides a't Chesterfield.

The ARMS of Heathcote are, Ermine, three pomeis, each charged with a cross, Or. CREST. Between two wings issuant from a mural coronet, a pomei charged with a cross, Or. The ancient and respectable family of Heathcote have held property in Chesterfield since the reign of Edward IV. when they were engaged in mercantile concerns. In 1584, we find Godfrey Heathcote, constable, and in 1594, alderman of Chesterfield. In 1594, William Heathcote was chamberlain, and Ralph and George burgesses. In 1598, Godfrey and Thomas Heathcote were elected aldermen. In 1599, George, Francis and Thomas Heathcote (tanner) were elected burgesses. In 1600, Godfrey accounts for the expenses of his mayoralty. In 1 602-3, Thomas accounts for the same, when Francis Heathcote was chamberlain. In 1606, John Heathcote (tanner) was elected a burgess, and the following year chamberlain. In 1607, Godfrey was mayor, and Francis constable. In 1609, Francis was elected a burgess. In this year Thomas Heathcote presented the Corporation with a gilt cup for his disfranchisement, on account of imperfection of body and im- pediment of sight.

Schoolmaster, and has issue. Rupert Montague, born 8th April, 1825. George Turner, bom 10th October, 1828. The family of Browne, of Hungry Bentley and Chesterfield is of considerable antiquity, and claim to be descended from Sir Anthony Browne, knt. who married Lucy, daughter of John Neville, Marquess Montacute, in the reign of Edward IV. and widow of Sir Thomas Fitzwil liams, of Aldwark, knt. father ofthe Earl of Southampton. The grandson of Sir Anthony, was Sir Anthony Browne, created Viscount Montacute, in 1553, by queen Mary, to whom he was Master of the Horse. He was high in favour with queen Elizabeth, notwithstanding his con tinuing a catholic, and was visited by her during his sickness. He died in 1592. \u2014 The marriage of Edmund Browne, esq. with Dorothy, daughter of Sir Edmund Vernon, knt. seems to have first connected this family with the county of Derby. In the course of the last century, Rupert Browne, esq. settled at Chesterfield, and left two sons, who espoused sisters, the co-heiresses of George Turner, of Wigwell Grange and Swanwick, in this county, esq. The Brights, the Youles, the Bournes, the Wilkinsons, and several good families have resided in Chesterfield, and the Bossleys, the Charges, the Duttons, and many other respectable families now reside there. The following letters are interesting as connected with the town of Chesterfield, which was a manor in the possession of the Earl of Shrewsbury at the time they were written. The writer was Thomas, Lord CrumweU (Cromwell) afterwards Earl of Essex, and one of the most distin guished counsellors of Henry VIII. The time to be assigned to these letters must be the latter end of the reign of that sovereign, and the hermit alluded to was probably some concealed catho lic priest engaged in exciting the lower people against the Reformation, To my very good Lord, th' erle of Shrewsbury, Lord Stuard to the King's Majestie. \" After my right herty com'endac'ons to your Lordship, I have by this bearer, your s 'rvaurit"], [359, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 331 bailly of Chesterfeld, recey ved your l'res and the byll therin enclosed concernyng thermyte ; the whiche being by me examyned, answered that he could not tell whether he spak em the same trayterouse words or not.

This once celebrated Roman station (now a ruinous village) one mile N. of Derby, bearing the ancient appellation of Derventio,* has been noticed by Camden, Dr. Stukeley, Dr. Pegge, and other celebrated antiquarians. This station, and the coins which have been dis- covered in it, we have before noticed, on pages 250 \u2014 252, in the first Volume of this work. In 1831, this township and constabulary contained 46 houses, 46 families, and 191 inhabitants. Of the families, 13 were employed in agriculture, 26 in trade or handicraft, and 7 variously. The Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds mail and post coach runs daily past the village. Several ofthe houses are falling rapidly into decay, and but little improvement has taken place here for some centuries, except the erection of an elegant house, the property of Mr. Harrison, engineer. The extent of the township is 436 a. 0 r. 12 p. of good freehold and copyhold land, including road and waste of llo.8r.18p. watered by the canal and the river Derwent, at an average rental of 50. . an acre, being let at various prices of from 30s. to 80.. an acre.

In 2/5, the Britons besieged and took it by storm, and put all the Romans to the sword."], [360, "332 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The manor of Little Chester includes the townships of Little Eaton and Quarndon. The manor after the Conquest is described in the Doomsday Survey as parcel of the ancient demesne ofthe crown. In the reign of Edward I. it belonged to, and has ever since continued to be the property of the Deans of Lincoln. The Degge family for a considerable time held a moiety of this manor under the Dean. The present lessee of the manor of Little Chester, cum membris, is the Duke of Devonshire. The following document relative to a cottage now standing in Little Chester, and occupied by Mr. William Gadsby, a framework-knitter, and eminent florist, has been for many years in his family, and contains some curious particulars not unworthy of record : the sword worn by his ancestor in the Cromwellian wars is still in his possession, the blade of which is 4 feet 6 inches. This puts him on a level in point of interest with the ancestor of William Flutton, mentioned by that shrewd and intelligent writer in his History of Derby. \" A trew account of the famaley of the Creswell, at Little Chester, in the County of Derby, by tradition from my grate granfather and granfather and mother ; that built and lived in the same house wherein I now am in the possession of, at Little Chester. \" My grate granfather, George Creswell, was a blacksmith, and lived in a house over against the place on which stands the house I now hold under the Gentlemen of the Corporation of Derby. The place opposite my grate granfather's house being unoccupied, he got leive of the Corporation to erect a building for shoeing horses in, for which he paid a small acknowledgment. And in some time he built a house, only of wood in part, and wattled it with wattlings, and covered the wattlings with clay, and then came to live in it. None of the flors was paved, but of the natural earth. Then he dyed, and my granfather, Robert Creswell, came to live in it, he was a labouring man, and had been a gentleman's sarvant, and had lived with one Mr. Britemore, in St. Alkmund's parish ; and lived with the same Mr. Britemore at the time of the sivle wares : this was in King Charles the First's time, which, at that time, King Charles the First ordered a press to take all the men that could be spared, and that could bear arms ; so the press gang came to take him, but he made his escape over the garding walls into the road going to Darley, and got over Darley wares, and so went to Nottingham, (which place generall Moonk had got in pos session, under Oliver Cromwell) where he inlisted in his trope of horse, and was with him in severall battles, and at the battle of Edge Hill, and continued with generall Moonk till the resto ration of King Charles the Second. He was then discharged and came to Little Chester. My grate granfather being dead, my granfather came to the same house and married ; and repared the house, and made some addition to it; and pained (panneled) some parts with brick, and made a plaster floore as there was one chamber only before, which was only boards in an irregular manner. He was imployed by Mr. Lord, of Little Chester (grandfather of the present Mr. Lord, of Little Chester) as a malt miller, the said Mr. Lord had a malt mill in the Full Street, (where now Mr. Heath's new house stands,) Mr. Lord was then the Mayor of Derby, and my granfa ther died in his sarvis. Then my father, George Creswell, came to it and made severall repares, and after some time built a part to the house, containing one seller, one parler and chamber, as it now is ; cost \u00a322. and upwards. After my mother died, my father let me come to it, where I now am : then it was repared by Mr. Sims, whom I paid upwards of five pounds ; last year but one fencing the orchard and thatching the house and other repares cost me \u00a34. Us. ; the whole ground, with the orchard and garding and what the house stands on, being no more than the 4th of an acre.\" The writer of this document has been dead about 70 years. William Gadsby, a framework-knitter, who came from Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire, married the only daughter of Robert Creswell, and resided at Little Chester until his death, when his son, William Gadsby, took possession of the cottage. William Gadsby was born in 1759 ; and has a son, William, and four daughters. He has held the cottage 45 years by paying an acknowledgment to the Corpo ration of \u00a3l. per annum. He has recently been raised to \u00a34. per annum. His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, as lessee of the manor under the Dean of Lincoln, holds a court annually.

W. of Seal, Childecote, on the south bank of the Trent, at almost an equal distance from Tamworth ' (the post town) Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and Burton on Trent; in that corner of the county, where the four counties of Derby, Leicester, Stafford, and Warwick, meet on the common, which is called by some Chilcote Common, by others Clifton Common, and by others No Man's Heath. This township contained, in 1831, 38 houses, 40 families, and 191 inhabitants, who are entirely supported by agriculture; it is in the parish of Clifton Camville, in the county of Staf ford, and in the hundred of Repton and Gresley in this county. In 1789 there were 14 houses. In Cildecote were three carucates of land to be taxed. Land to three ploughs. Three villanes have there two ploughs and twelve acres of meadow. Value in king Edward's time 40.. now 10.. This berewick then belonged to Cliftune, in Sladford. D. B. As to its ancient history, but little is known. Erdeswick speaks of it as if it were situate in the county of Stafford ; but gives little information respecting it, and the little he does give, is conveyed in very doubtful terms. He says Chilcote was \" so called, as I think, because it was one child's land. In 136S, one Richard Childcote was, I take it, owner thereof, and so continued till 2 Richard II. but whose it was before or since I know not.\" In 4 Richard II. Robert de Berkeley was possessed of the manor of Chilcote.* The Berkeleys held it under the Earls of Chester. The heiress of Sir Thomas Berkeley brought it early in the fifteenth century to Sir Thomas Bridges. Sir Giles Bridges, knt. of Corberley, in the county of Gloucester, father of John, first Lord Chandos, died September 1, 1511, seised inter alia of this manor of Chilcote. It appears that this, like Radbourn, was part of the old Chandos estates. This manor was for many years in the family of Milward, and was afterwards the property of Godfrey Bagnal Clarke, of Sutton, in Scarsdale, esq. from whom it passed by marriage to Job Hart Price, esq. who assumed the name of Clarke, and whose son, Godfrey Bagnold Clarke, succeeded to it; who, dying with out issue, was succeeded by his sister Anne, who married, in 1805, Walter Butler, the 17th Earl and first Marquess of Ormonde. This estate, consisting of nearly 1 400 acres of land, was, to gether with the valuable and extensive English estates ofthe late Marquess, consigned to sale by means of an especial Act obtained for that purpose, under the direction of the trustees therein appointed. In 1 824, on the 1 8th November, this estate was sold by auction at the Auction Mart, London, to Francis Robertson, esq. for the sum of \u00a387,000. The rental of this valuable estate was esti mated at \u00a32,600. per annum. The estimated annual value of all the messuages, buildings and land, according to the return entered in the County office, is \u00a32,209- 10_. The land is excellent, and the average rental is about 40.. per acre. Mr. Robertson is the sole proprietor, and lord of the manor. Chilcote is a valuable and well circumstanced estate. A very large old mansion, on a spot which had been surrounded by every comfort of affluence, was pulled down a few years ago for the materials : and the sole memorials left of its ancient owners, are two glass fragments (fixed in the window of the honest neighbouring farmer at Clifton lodge, who happens to be also some what of a Herald.)

Amongst Sir Aston Cokayne's Poems we find the following, addressed to his cousin, Mr. Wil liam Milward: \" Whilst you at Chilcote live, and I at Pooley : Let's every week meet one another duly : Talk of our long acquaintance, and the strange Things that have happ'ned since this mighty change : And drink a glass of honest country ale To all our absent friends at every tale.\" * Dugdale says, 13th August, 4 Richard II.

In 1831, it contained 189 houses, 192 families, and 993 inhabitants. Ofthe families, 43 were employed in agriculture, 30 in trade or handicraft (chiefly cotton spinning) and 119 variously. This township is surrounded by high mountains, called South-head, Chinley-churn (where excellent paving and slating stones are procured) and others. The small places or villages of Ashenclough, the Nase, the Four lane ends, and Moslee, are in this township. The extent of the township is about 3000 acres of gritstone land, chiefly meadow and pasture, watered by the Sher-brook, Ford-brook, Hall-brook, Black-brook, Frith river, and other small streams, which fall into the river Goyte at Whaley bridge. The land is divided into small farms at an average rental of about 25s. an acre. The non-resident freeholders are Messrs. Daniel Barber, Peter Bramwell, George Hollingshead, John Hudson, John Ibbotson, John Lingard, Francis Marriott, Henry Middleton, Joseph Nixon, John Pearson, and William Williamson. The resident freeholders are Messrs. James Barnes, James Braddock, William Broadhurst, Anthony Carrington, the elder and younger, Thomas Drinkwater of Beard, Thomas Drinkwater of Green head, Thomas Drinkwater of Waterside, John Drinkwater of Meadow, John Drinkwater of Chinley Head, Joseph Drinkwater of Clough Head, Joseph Nicholas, James Goddard, Thomas Goodman of Eccles house, Joseph Hadfield, Joel Handford, Daniel Hanson, Jonathan, William and Obadiah Porritt, John Kirk, James Kinder, Thomas Lomas, John Lowe, John Middleton, Edward Swindell, William Simpson, William and John Taylor, William Ward, Jonathan and William Waterhouse, Samuel Winterbottom, and the Rev. Ebenezer Glossop. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a329 1 6. Ss. 6d. The average of the poor, county and other rates for the last eight years amount to \u00a3313. 8s. 6d. by the year. Chinley, being extra pa rochial, pays no church rates ; but Bugsworth and Brownside contribute to the church rates at Glossop. The hamlet of Chinley pays a fee farm rent to the king of \u00a312. a year. The great tithes of this township were let by the Duke of Norfolk to the proprietors as follows: Chinley for \u00a318. Bugsworth \u00a39. 9s. and Brownside \u00a39. They have since been sold to Messrs. Rimington and Wake, of Sheffield, who have considerably raised the tithes, charging from 9*- to 12.. an acre for oats, and from 1 5*. to 20s. for wheat, which has caused many of the farmers to discontinue the growth of grain. There are here three men's clubs, consisting of about 200 members, and one female club, of 300 members. Here are three dissenting chapels, two day schools, and one Sunday school, which is supported by voluntary contributions ; one county bridge, at Chapel Milltown, half of another at Brownside, and three public houses in the township. The inhabitants of this township owe suit and service to the king's manor of High Peak, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire, who holds his courts at Chapel-en-le-Frith. The Independent chapel at Chinley, which was built in 1711, originally belonged to the Rev. William Bagshaw, who formed a congregation here after his ejection from Glossop in 1662.

CHISWORTH and LUDWORTH form a constabulary and township in the chapelry of Chisuorde, Leedworth, Mellor, in the manor and parish of Glossop, in the hun dred of High Peak, and is situate on the east bank of the river Goyte. In 1831, these places contained 312 houses, 333 families, ancl 1734 inhabitants; of the families, 42 were employed in agriculture, 279 in trade or handicraft, and 12 variously. The chief manufacture is cotton spinning. The extent ofthe township is \u2014 Chisworth 863 a. 3 r. 38 p. and Ludworth 1733 a. 1 r. 5 p. the whole being gritstone and coal land, watered by the Goyte and numerous small streams. About one-tenth of the land is arable, and the remainder meadow and pasture; being chiefly divided into small farms, at an average rental of 1 5s. per acre. The principal freeholder is the Duke of Norfolk, who owns 1 701 a. 0 r. 38 p. in Ludworth, and 844 a. 2 r. 10 p. in Chisworth. The other freeholders in Chisworth are the Earls of Stamford and Dysart; and in Ludworth, the Earl of Stamford, Egerton Tatton, Nathaniel Wright, and Ardern, esqrs. William Roylance, and the representatives of the late William Chatterton. The estimated annual value of all the land and buildings is \u00a33229. Os. lOd. The parochial expenses bear about the same proportion as the neighbouring townships in Glossop Dale. The great tithes belong to the Duke of Norfolk, and the small tithes to the Vicar of Glossop. \" On Ludworth common there is a flat stone about 8 feet long and 3 feet 6 inches wide, and nearly 2 feet thick, approaching in form to an oval, on which formerly stood two stone pillars, fixed in round sockets and tapering upwards. In 1810, Messrs. Lysons state that only one part remained in its original position, this was two feet 6 inches in height and 20 inches in diameter at the top : the upper part, 2 feet 6 inches in length, had been broken off and removed to the dis tance of several feet : the lower part of the other, which has also been removed from its socket, is 4 feet two inches in length, 18 inches in diameter at the bottom and 15| inches at the top. This ancient monument (which bears a good deal of resemblance to one of the same kind, called the Bow Stones, on the Cheshire side of the river, and at no great distance from it) has received from the country people the appellation of Robin Hood's Picking Rods. As double pillars appear among the earliest sepulchral monuments in christian cemeteries, it is not improbable these were erected to some illustrious person in the pagan times.\" In Leedworth, Brun had four ox-gangs of land lo be taxed. D. B. 295. In Chiseurde and Cheuenesurd Swin had one carucate of land. D. B. 295. In 1345, Thomas le Ragged enfeoffed John Foljambe of two-thirds of the manor of Chisworth. In 1360, the whole manor was conveyed by Richard Foljambe and Robert de Holt to the abbey of Basingwerke. It has since been considered as parcel of the manor of Glossop; Ludworth is also a parcel of that manor, of which manor His Grace the Duke of Norfolk is lord. CHUNAL, a village and hamlet in the manor and parish of Glossop, in the hundred of High Peak, contained in 1831, 19 houses, 1 19 inhabitants, and 19 families ; 14 of whom were employed in agriculture, and 4 in trade or handicraft. The extent ofthe township is 885 a. 1 r. 6 p. of grit stone land, the property of His Grace the Duke of Norfolk, and is divided into small farms, at an average rental of 15.. per acre.

Clivcs, in Mugginton. CLOWN, a pleasant village, is a parish and constabulary in the deanery of Chesterfield, and Clune, hundred of Scarsdale, about 9 miles from Chesterfield. In 1831, it contained 134 houses, 637 inhabitants, and 136 families; of whom 69 were chiefly employed\" in agriculture, 58 in trade and handicraft, and 9 variously. The inhabitants are now chiefly employed in agri culture with the exception of a few hands employed in a mill for the manufacture of candle-wick, sacking and sail-cloth, and at the collieries. The extent of the parish is 1825 acres of limestone and clay land, partly freehold and partly copyhold, and is well watered by numerous springs. The high ground is principally limestone, and the land in the valleys and low ground is a strong clay. The farms are small, at an average rental of 25s. per acre. The estimated annual value of the buildings and land is \u00a3l660. The tithes, which belong to the Rector, are generally compounded for. The principal freeholders are Mrs. Hill, of Romely, Henry Bowdon, of Southgate house, esq. Mr. Cornelius Brown, the Duke of Devonshire, and a few other small freeholders. There are also many small copyholders under the Duke of Portland, who holds a court at Bolsover, in which manor the greater portion of the parish of Clown is situate. The parochial rates (including constable and county rates) have for the last three years averaged \u00a3230. a year. There is neither workhouse or house of industry, the poor having an allowance at home. The average rate of a labourer's wages is 2s. a day, and nothing is paid out of the poor rate in lieu of wages. There is one endowed free school, and a Sunday school supported by voluntary contribution, and five public houses. In Clune Ernui had six ox-gangs of land to be taxed. Land to one plough.

Robert Folville held one messuage and 40 acres of glebe land under the church ; two other messuages and 21 acres of land under the king in the same manner as the castle of Bolsover. The parish is partly situate in the Duke of Portland's manor of Bolsover, and partly in that of Barlborough, belonging to the Rev. C. H. Reaston Rodes. Romely Hall, in this parish, in the reign of queen Elizabeth belonged to the family of Wood, afterwards to that of Routh, of whom it was purchased by Mr. Wright, of Sheffield. The nephew of the latter, in 178S, devised it to Daniel Thomas Hill, esq. and in 1816 it was the residence of the Rev. Thomas Hill, and now of Mrs. Hill. The estate belonging to this hall is partly in Clown, and partly in Barlborough and Bolsover. Romely hall was some time in the occupation of the late Dr. Thomas Gisborne, Physician in Ordinary to the King, and President of the College of Physicians, who died there in 1806. The ancient gothic church, with a tower, is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, though it appears in the reign of Henry III. to have been called by another name ; for that monarch confirmed the church of All Saints, at Clown, to the priory of Radford, near Worksop. Richard de Rawcliff was parson here 8 Richard II. William Inskip (founder of the school) died 1582, having been rector 54 years. Thomas Donne was rector in 1734.

George Bowdon, of Bowdon, by Barbara, daughter of Nicholas Bagshaw, of Abney, had Ed ward and George Bowdon, living in 1 (il 1, married Ellen, daughter of Augustine Pole, of Langley, and had issue Thomas, who died in his father's lifetime (leaving issue) ; German, married Florence, daughter of Nicholas Bradbume ; Ann, married Rowland Smith, of Waterford, and George, mar ried Ellen, daughter and heir of George Bowdon, of Cheshire, by whom he had William and Edward, who had a son George, married to Ellen, daughter of Augustine Pole, of Langley, by his wife Cecily, daughter of the aforesaid William Bowdon. \u2014 Thomas Bowdon, who died in his father's lifetime, as before stated, left issue George, aged 12 years in l6ll, Nicholas, Edward, Thomas, Anne, Elizabeth, and Dorothy. George Bowdon, probably the one aged 12 in 1611, in 1633, was a benefactor to the poor of Chapel-en-le-Frith. A Nicholas Bowdon, of this family, probably brother of George, married Mary, daughter of Thomas Barnby, of Barnby, county of York, whose son, George Bowdon, of Barnby, esq. died 1680, and is said, by Lysons, to have been the last of the family. He was probably the last of the elder branch : but from a perusal of the above short sketch, it plainly appears that there are several younger branches, of whom nothing is stated, and from some of whom it is probable the Bowdons of Beighton Fields are de scended. Mr. Bowdon, of Beighton Fields, states that the Bowdon hall estate continued in the family until it descended to two daughters, co-heiresses, when it was sold, but the heirs male, with the remaining property, settled at Beighton Fields. John Bowdon (the father of the present Henry Bowdon, esq.) being a catholic, and under age, at the demise of his uncle, Mr. John Allen, of Whetstone hall, near Tideswell (in consequence of the several penal laws then existing against catholics) derived little or no benefit from his uncle's bequest, as the next protestant heir stepped into the estate. This family might most likely have shown their connexion with the Bowdons, of Bowdon, but for the loss of many papers which were lost or destroyed by the jiersecutions fre quently carried on against catholic families. Southgate House is a delightful residence, it was purchased and rebuilt at a great expense by the present proprietor, and is now become the chief family seat. COAL or COLD ASTON, a village, township and constablewick in the parish of Dronfield, and in the hundred of Scarsdale, is situate on a considerable eminence 1 mile N.

The eldest son, Richard, seated himself at Codnor castle, which castle and manor con- tinued to be the residence and property of his descendants to the ninth generation. In 1 496, on the death of Henry, last Lord Grey de Codnor, it reverted to Sir John Zouch, grandson of John Zouch, esq. who married Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Richard, Lord Grey, K. G. and aunt of the last Lord Grey of this place. Sir John Zouch then seated himself here. His son, Sir George Zouch, died 3 or 4 of Philip and Mary, and was possessed of 1000 acres of arable land, 2000 acres of pasture, 100 acres of meadow, and 100 acres of wood, which he held under the King and Queen in capite, as of the honour of Peverel. His grandson, Sir John Zouch, and his son and heir apparent, John, in 1634, joined in selling the Codnor estate to Dr. Neile, Archbishop of York, and his son, Sir Paul Neile. Their descendant, Richard Neile, esq. sold the manor and castle of Codnor, with its members, Heanor, Loscoe and Langley, and the manor of Codnor Park, in 1692, to Sir Streynsham Master, knt. who resided here, and was sheriff of this county in 1712, and in his family the same still remains. Charles Legh Hoskins Master, of Barrow Green house, Surrey, esq. (great great grandson of the first purchaser) being the present owner. In 1 330, Robert, Lord Grey, claimed the right of having pillory, tumbril, and gallows, and four parks within the manor of Codnor. The Marquess of Ormond, when he sold his estate here, consisting of upwards of 1000 acres, reserved the coal, which, we believe, has since been purchased by Messrs. Jessop and Co. These gentlemen pay the proprietors about three times the annual rental for the land they occupy in working the coal mines. The ironstone, gritstone and clay, we are also informed, belong to the proprietor of the land. Codnor castle stood upon high ground, and commanded an extensive prospect towards the"], [370, "342 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER east, on which side was a broad ditch or moat, and on the bank grew a double row of trees, which were cut down more than a century ago. On the south side there was formerly a large square court, from which were two entrances or gates into the castle : the wall on the west side of the court is yet standing : in it are two large recesses, which were probably used as watch houses. It is not possible now to discover the size and extent of this ancient fortress : from the ruined walls which are yet standing, and the foundation of others which may be traced near them, it appears to have been a very large building. Nearly a century ago all the outer walls were standing. It is said that six farm houses, with other convenient buildings, were afterwards raised with the materials collected from the ruins of the old castle. The park, connected with the castle, has long been converted into tillage : this was very extensive, containing about 3000 acres of land. . Pedigree of the families of GREY and ZOUCH, of Codnor.

Isabella, dau. of Patrick Lowe, of Denby, esq. The descent of the family of Grey is deduced by a French genealogist and antiquary of great repute (Francis de Belloforest, of Cominges) from Rollo, chamberlain to Robert, Duke of Nor mandy, who obtained by grant from his master the castle and honour of Croy, in Picardy, whence the surname of De Croy changed into De Grey, is said to have originated. In Howard's lately published Life of Lady Jane Grey, the descent of this family from Rolla to Sir Henry Grey, of Turroc, is given as stated in the pedigree. This Sir Henry de Grey, 6 Richard I. obtained from the king a grant of the manor of Turroc, in Essex. 8 Richard I. William de Brewere, sheriff, gave, account of 1 00.. of Henry de Grey scutage for five knights' fees, because he was in the king's service beyond the sea. King John, in the first year of his reign, confirmed the said charter with special license to hunt the fox and hare in any lands belonging to the crown, except the king's own demesnes. In 13 John, Henry de Grey held six knights' fees of the honour of Peverel, which came to the king by escheat in the counties of Derby and Nottingham, viz. in Henoure one, in Normanton one, in Shirland one, in Codenoure and Touton one, in Radcliff one, and Beely one. In 1 Henry III. he had a grant of the manor of Grimstone, county of Nottingham, from Robert Bardolf, for his support in the king's service. This Robert Bardolf died in 9 Henry III. when the said Henry de Grey, having mar ried Isolda, daughter of Hugh Bardolf, and niece and co-heir of the said Robert Bardolf, shared with Maud Bardolf and others all the lands of the said Robert. His issue by her was six sons, the eldest son and heir, Richard, whose principal seat was at Codnor, adhered to king John in all his wars against the barons, and had the lands in Leicestershire of John de Humez, his father-in-law, who bore arms against the king, given him for his services. In 2 John, he had all the lands of Simon de Courcy, in Lincolnshire. In 10 Henry III. he was made governor of the islands of Guernsey and Jersey ; in 12 Henry III. he had the custody of the castle of Devises ; 20th of the same, he was sheriff of Northumberland. In 26 of the same reign he was by writ required to fit himself with horse and arms to attend the king into France. 30 Henry III. on the death of Isolda, his mother (who had married Reginald de Mendre) he did homage and had livery of all the lands she held in the counties of Nottingham and Derby. 36 Henry III. \" the king called all the Londoners together;"], [372, "344 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER and bade the bishops excite them to take a voyage with him to the Holy land, when but few of them would go ; this Richard, and John, his brother, readily consented, and the king kissed them and called them his brothers.\" 42 Henry III. he was made constable of Dover castle, warden of the cinque ports, and discovered much treasure which the king's enemies had ready to convey into France. In the following year he had his commission renewed for being constable of Dover castle. In this year he was deprived of the custody of Dover castle, and went over to the barons, and was with young Mountfort at Kenilworth, who was marching to join his father in the north. A party of prince Edward's horse surprised this Richard and his son John in the night, and his lands were extended, but were restored again by virtue of the Dictum de Kenilworth, on pay ment of their fines. In 1240, he founded in Aylesford Wood, in Kent, a house for Carmelites, in imitation of those he had seen in the Holy land. And died about 1255, leaving a son and heir. John de Grey, of Codnor, who died 56 Henry III. 1271, seised of Codnor, an old escheat of the crown, Sheringham, county of Norfolk, Turroc, in Essex, of a knight's fee in Elsford, of a knight's fee in Hoo, of Radcliff and Towton, county of Nottingham, Evington, county of Leicester, of Newbottle, in Northamptonshire, and that Henry, his son and heir, was 14 years of age. Who, in 10 Edward I. being in the king's army, in Wales, had scutage of all his tenements in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent, Essex, Leicester, Nottingham, and Derby : 22 of the same reign he had summons to be at Portsmouth well accoutred: 23 and 25 of that reign he was also in the king's service. In 29 of the same he was in the king's service in Scotland, and was of the retinue of Prince Edward : 29th same he entered into a recognizance to Edward Payne, in the penalty of \u00a310,000. to be void if he did not sell or alienate the manor of Towton and Eastwood, county of Nottingham, but suffer them to de scend to Richard, his son and heir. In 31 of the same reign he was again in the Scotch wars. In 1 Edward II. he was one of the barons, who, under their hands and seals, obliged themselves to defend the king, his crown and dignity against all men. He gave a cottage in Sheringham, county of Norfolk, to a religious house in Buckinghamshire, to pray for the souls of himself and Alice, his wife. He died 2 Edward II. (1309). He was the first Baron Grey de Codnor, by writ, and was succeeded by Richard, Lord Grey, his son and heir, aged 26 years. Who, 2 Edward II. had livery of his father's lands : 4 th of the same he was in the Scotch wars ; and in the 6th of same was seneschal of Gascony : 8th of same had the wardship of Ralph, son and heir of Edward Bassett ; and the same year was ordered to advance to Newcastle with horse and arms. In the 12th of the same he was again in the Scotch wars. In the 13th same he was in the retinue of Thomas de Brother ton, Earl of Norfolk. 1 7th of the same he was made steward of the duchy of Acquitain ; and the next year he went with his brother to take possession of the duchy, because the French king re fused to do homage to the king of England for it. In 18 Edward II. the jury found it not to the king's loss if he granted John, the son of Richard de Grey, and Alianore, his wife, to retain the castle of Codnor with the members in Derbyshire, and that of Towton remaining over, &c. In 3 Edward III. this Richard de Grey claimed the emendation ofthe assize of bread, and ale, broken in Towton, as a member of Codnor. In 19 Edward II. and 1 Edward III. he was constable of Nottingham castle ; and in the latter year he was sent in the king's service into the marches of Scotland. In 4 Edward III. he obtained a charter for a market and two fairs at his manors of Turroc, in Essex, and Elford, in Kent, and for free warren in all his demesnes in Codnor, county of Derby : 7th of the same he was summoned to be at Newcastle on Trinity Sunday, well accou tred, to march with the king against the Scotch : 8th of same he obtained a charter for a market every Thursday, at his manor of Denby, county of Derby, with a fair on the Eve of the Nativity ofthe Blessed Virgin. He died 9 Edward III. seised ofthe manor of Aylesford, in Kent, manor and castle of Codnor, county of Derby, manor of Turroc, in Essex, &c. leaving his son and heir, John, Lord Grey, 28 years of age. Who, in 3 Edward III. his father being alive, was in the king's service in Scotland, where he behaved himself so bravely that the same king, in the 9th of"], [373, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 345 his reign, acknowledging his great services, acquitted him of all he owed in the exchequer and gave him livery of all his lands, save Joan, his mother's dowry. In 11 Edward III. he was in the Scotch wars; and the year following he was in Flanders, in the king's service. In 13 Ed ward III. on a general summons of all the king's commanders to provide arms, he was exempt being then in Flanders : 14th of the same he was in the naval fight near Stayes : the beginning of the following year he was in the Scotch wars ; and afterwards went with Edward Earl of Derby, into France, and because he staid there the next year, he was exempted from finding men to guard the coast. In 18 Edward III. he and two others were commissioned to array all the men in Derbyshire from sixteen to sixty years of age against the Scotch : 20th of same he went with the king in his expedition into France, where he was the following year with the Earl of Lancaster. He was so active a person, and in such high esteem with the king, that he was made a Knight of the Garter, on the first foundation of the order : 26th of same he was joined in com- mission with William, Lord Deincourt, to array all the knights and esquires and men at arms in the counties of Derby and Nottingham, in case of an invasion from France. In 29 and 32 Ed- ward III. he was in the wars with France, with Henry, Earl of Lancaster. In 33rd of same he was made governor of Rochester castle for life. In 39 Edward III. he obtained license to go on a pilgrimage. In 45th of same, being grown aged, and not able to endure travel, he had a special patent from the king, enumerating his valour and services, exempting him from all further ser- vices. He died about 1392, 15 Richard II. By Alice de Insula, his wife, he had two sons, Henry and John, both of whom served in the French wars, 43 Edward III. ; Henry the eldest died in his father's lifetime, leaving a son, Richard, Lord Grey, of Codnor, grandson and heir. Who, in 16 Richard II. (1393) did homage to the king, and had livery of his lands. In 17 and 21 Richard II. he was in the wars of France. In 2 Henry IV. (April 6) he was constituted admiral of the king's fleet from the mouth of the Thames towards the northern parts of England. The same year he was iointlv with Sir Stephen Scrope, consituted governor of Roxburgh castle. In 3rd of same he was in the French wars ; and two years after made Justice of South Wales. In 8th of same he was consta- ble of Nottingham castle and chief ranger of Sherwood forest for life. In 14th of same he was made governor of a castle in the duchy of Acquitain : in which year, being chamberlain to the king, he was joined in commission with Thomas, Bishop of Durham, to treat of a marriage with the Duke of Burgundy, between his daughter and the king's eldest son. In 2 Henry V. he was joined in commission with the same Bishop to treat of a marriage between Henry V. and the French king's daughter. In the same year he was one of the commissioners to treat of a truce between Scotland and England. In the following year he was made lord warden of the East Marches, and commanded with John, Lord Nevile, to receive Henry, the son of Sir Henry Percy at the hands of the Duke of Albany, governor of Scotland. In 5 Henry V. he was made gov- ernor of the castle of Angevin, in Normandy : he was afterwards made a Knight of the Garter. He married Elizabeth, one of the two daughters and co-heirs of Ralph, Lord Bassett, of Sapcote and had two sons and one daughter, and died, 6 Henry VI. seised in fee amongst other things of the castle and manor of Codnor, and was succeeded by John, Lord Grey, his son and heir, aged 22 years on his father's death. He had issue one son, Henry, who died in the same year as his father, 9 Henry VI. This John, Lord Grey, having no surviving issue, was succeeded by his brother, Henry, Lord Grey, then 25 years of age. He married Margaret, daughter and heir of Henry, Lord Percy, of Athol, and died 22 Henry VI. ( 1 443) being succeeded by Henry, last Lord Grey, of Codnor, son and heir, aged 9 years at his father's death. This Lord being much devoted to chemistry, obtained a license for the transmutation of metals. In 1458, he confirmed his father's appointment of John Clarke, to be keeper of the parks of Codnor and Aldercar, with a salary of 2<_. a day. In 13 Edward IV. in consideration of his great services, he had a grant for forty years of a large tract of land in Ireland. In 1 Richard III. he had another grant of lands. In 5 Henry VII. he suffered a recovery of the manors of Dunham, Eastwood, Towton, Barton, and Radcliffe, which he settled on his two natural sons (by Catherine Yy"], [374, "346 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Finderne) named Henry Grey, of Towton, and Richard Grey, of Ratcliff. His Lordship married Catherine, said to be daughter to the Earl of Devonshire. 10th September, 8 Henry VII. he be queathed his body to be buried in the church of Aylesford, in Kent. He died on the vigil of Easter Eve, 10 Henry VII. (1496) without lawful issue. On his death the posterity of his aunt Elizabeth, who married John Zouch, a younger son of William, Lord Zouch, of Harringworth, inherited Codnor castle and manor. In 1513, Sir John Zouch, of Codnor, was a captain in the vanguard of the king's army in France, and his brother, Davy, was his petty captain. On his death, his son and heir, Sir George Zouch, succeeded him, who died 3 and 4 Philip and Mary, when it was found that he held the castle and manor of Codnor with their appurtenances, and twenty messuages in Ripeley, thirteen cottages in Codnor, Heanor, Langley and Loscoe ; and the manor of Ripeley, and twenty messuages in Ripeley, But terley, Pentriche, Moorehaye (Marehay) Hatcher, Ufton, and Pandley fields, in the county of Derby, of the Queen in capite by knights' service, and that John Zouch was his son and heir. This John was afterwards knighted, and died before 37 Elizabeth. In which year, as also 47th of the same reign, John Zouch, his son and heir, claimed, as son and heir of John Zouch, knt. son and heir of George Zouch, esq. son and heir of John Zouch, knt. son and heir of John Zouch, esq. son and heir of Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Richard, Lord Grey, father of Henry, Lord Grey, father of Henry, last Lord Grey. This John Zouch, of Codnor, was knighted in 1615. In 1634, he and his son and heir appa rent, John, sold Codnor castle and manor and the rest of their estates. After which the family are said to have removed into Ireland. From one of Sir Aston Cokayne's Poems, addressed to Mrs. Milward, it appears that Sir John Zouch emigrated to Virginia, where he and his daughter Catherine both died, when Isabella, another daughter (the Lady to whom the poem above men tioned is addressed) came back to England, and married Mr. Milward, one of the younger sons of Sir Thomas Milward, of Eaton Dovedale, in this county, knt. : but whether there were any more children, or whether John Zouch, esq. left any issue has not been ascertained. Several of the Zouch family of Codnor have served the office of high sheriff for this county, as will be seen by reference to the list in the Appendix of the first volume.

Sir Streynsham had been governor of Fort St. George, in the East Indies, and was high sheriff of the county of Derby in 1712.

The parish is chiefly in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, but extends partly into Scarsdale and Wirksworth hun- dreds. The parish of Crich includes the townships of Crich, Wessington and Tansley. Crich is a township comprising the villages of Fritchley, Dark lane, Edge Moor, Codington, Wheatcroft, and Plaistow, part of Upper and Nether Halloway, and Wakebridge, which form one constablewick. In 1831, this township contained 436 houses, 444 families, and 2115 in habitants. Of the families, 68 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 196 in trade or handicraft, and 180 variously ; the greater part of the latter were miners. There was formerly a market at Crich, and although there are no records of its grant, it appears to have been of considerable an tiquity. It was attempted to be revived about the middle of the last century, at which period it had long been discontinued. In 1810, it was again opened, and still continues to be held on Thursdays, for provisions, &c. but is not much resorted to. There are two fairs held on the 6th of April, and the 1 1th of October, for horses, cows, sheep, pigs, pedlars' wares, &c. On Crich cliff, the greatest elevation in the neighbourhood, and about half a mile north of the church, Francis Hurt, esq. grandfather of the present Francis Hurt, of Alderwasley, esq. erected an obelisk, called Crich stand, which commands a very extensive view over the surrounding country, particularly towards the east and south, and was one of the stations chosen by Colonel Mudge when he made his general survey of the kingdom.

They present a pleasing variety of outline, and their steep sides are adorned with some of the most beautiful woods that ever waved their branches to the winds. The river, with here and there a bridge thrown across the stream, courses through the depths of the vale, and its margin is enriched with almost every object that can delight in landscape scenery. \" The road from Crich to Cromford is carried along the side of a steep hill by a gradual descent. It first passes the Holloways along a kind of mountain terrace that overlooks a long series of miles of beautiful country : it then sinks rapidly amongst the thick woods that border Lea mill. Every step along this road varies the prospect, and the traveller is sometimes delighted with the beauty, and at others elevated by the magnificence of the views it presents.\" The town of Crich is built on a considerable elevation, and its church and stand are very con spicuous objects from a distance of several miles round. The village occupies the summit of an immense limestone hill, that overlooks all the eminences around it. The inhabitants are chiefly supported by working the lead mines (some of which are very rich) in getting and burning of limestone (which is excellently adapted for agricultural and building purposes) the manufacture of stockings and agriculture.

The steward of the court leet and court baron within the manor and liberty of Crich, shall be the steward for deciding such differences wherein a steward shall be thought necessary to be called upon, pursuant to the fol- lowing Articles. 2. The lords, with the rest who are concerned for lot and cope, are to choose an honest man to be bar-master, and the steward to give him his oath, wrhich oath is, \"That he shall be just between lord and miner, and be- tween miner and miner and burner, to the best of his knowledge and good conscience.'' 3. For a new rake or vein, the miner is to give one dish of the first ore therein gotten to the bar-master, for which the bar-master is to measure him out two meers of ground, containing thirty yards apiece, viz. from the middle of the spindle at either end a meer of ground, and then the lords are to have at either end half a meer, containing fifteen yards apiece, and then the miner is to have every meer of ground as far as he is possessed of, paying to the lords every ninth dish of ore therein gotten, and freeing the same from taker meer to taker meer, as far as he is pos sessed of. 9. It is not custom for the miner to go into a fresh close of ground to dig or delve for lead ore without the tenant's consent, unless the miner can bring in a vein along with him off the common, and then he may, or if there hath been mines or old works the bar-master may set the miner on, the tenant having a third part, or a sixth part, if he will maintain the same, or else not. 10.

Ten shillings of the said eighteen shillings and four-pence going to the steward, and the re- maining eight shillings and four-pence to be then laid out in entertaining the steward, bailiff, bar-master, and those concerned in the lot and cope, who shall then attend upon this article. 11. If it happen that there be two founders in one vein, and there fall odd ground under fifteen yards, it falls to the lords ; it is not serviceable to the miner, but is called a Prim Gap. 12. If there happen to be odd yards of ground adjoining to this liberty, and another under fifteen yards, it is not serviceable to the miner, but it falleth to the lords, but if above, it is the miner's, according to his taking. 13. If it happen that the miner neglecteth to work his mine, and lets it stand unwrought six weeks together, the bar-master may nick it three weeks together, and in four days after the last nick, he may give the same away for want of workmanship lawfully. 14. It is not custom within the manor of Crich, for the miner to set on any old work without the bar-master, or 4. For an old rake or vein for one dish of ore to the bar-master, the miner is to have from the middle of the spindle at either end fifteen yards, which maketh a whole meer or thirty yards, and the lords no half meer, the mi- ner freeing every taker meer of ground. 5. If the miner be possessed of twenty or thirty meers of ground, being more or less and lawfully taken and stoced, and given away by the bar-master, and booked and kept in lawful possession, it is not the custom within the manor of Crich for any man to take such meers until such time as the bar-master shall think fit to give the same away: and the person or persons to whom they are given shall pay the bar-master four-pence for every meer of ground for booking. 6. The buyer or burner is to pay sixpence a load to the lords for cope for every load or nine dishes of ore, for which the buyer is to have regress and freegress. 7- If any partner having a share or part of a mine within the manor and liberty of Crich, refusing to pay his part or share of the charges, his partners making three lawful reckonings, two weeks to a reckoning that they will swear to, and complaining to the bar-master, who shall then show or send to him the reckoning (if he can"], [378, "350 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER any freed meer of ground, crosses and holes stand but for three days without stoces. 15.

If any difference shall arise between miner and miner, the bar-master and bailiff may put an end to it, unless there shall be occasion to examine witnesses on oath on both sides. Then the steward is to decide such difference, and award satisfaction as the right shall ap pear. 19. If any miner conveys ore besides the bar-master's dish, the bar-master may set a fine of \u00a32. upon him be sides the ore, and the buyer as much, and arrest for the same. 20. The bar-master may go down into any man's mines or grooves, or put any man down to search for any stolen things belonging to the mines. 21. The bar-master may dial any miner's ground, or mine, to see whether he hath two veins or but one, and to see if he doth not trespass upon another miner or drive out of his length. The miner is to drive his ground to his stool and to his ground's end, and to give his neigh bour insight that the mine be not neglected. 22. If any miner drives into another miner's ground and gets his ore, the bar-master may go down and take three or four honest miners along with him and value the trespass, and cause him to pay as much ore back, or the value of it in money, as they think it worth. 23. If any miner be damped or killed in the mines within this liberty, the bar-master is instead of a coroner. 17- The bar-master may arrest the ore for wages, or any materials to the mines, as timber, smith work, can dles, powder, or bread and cheese and ale, but ale with out bread and cheese he cannot. And when the ore is measured, the bar -master takes the money and pays the debt, and returns the remainder to the owner thereof. 18. No miner is to bring any unlawful weapon to the mines; and if it chance that a miner (or any other per son wrhomsoever) quarrels upon the mine and fights and draws blood on the mine, he shall pay the sum of 3.. id. before the sun set, otherwise the bar-master may set a fine upon him of (is. 8d. and arrest his ore for the same.

He died seised of it in 1325. Sir Roger Belers, who died in 1380, left two dauo-hters who possessed this manor in moieties, but the whole devolved eventually to the descendants of Sir Robert de Swillington, who married the elder. From the Swillingtons the manor passed by inheritance to Ralph, Lord Cromwell, who, in the reign of Henry VI. sold the reversion to John Talbot, the second Earl of Shrewsbury. Upon the death of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury in I6l6 it was divided amongst his three daughters and co-heiresses, the Countesses of Pembroke Kent and Arundel. The Countess of Pembroke's share passed through the Saviles to an ancestor of the Earl of Thanet, who is the present proprietor. The Countess of Kent conveyed her share to her uncle Edward, Earl of Shrewsbury. The Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1710, sold the lands, which were soon after divided into parcels: and, in 171 1, conveyed his third of the manor or barony to William Sudbury and four other persons. The remaining third was sold in 1660 for \u00a33270. by the Honourable Henry Howard, to Anthony Bennet and Ralph Smith. A short abstract of which deed, and two others relating to this manor, here follows : \" By Indenture of feoffment, dated 7th April, 1660.

After reciting the former deed of l660, and the deaths of Newton and Sage, the shares of each party are declared and granted to each other : viz. one-eighth of two-thirds of one-third of the manor, viz. one-thirty-sixth ofthe whole lot and cope to William Newton, in fee; one-eighth of two-thirds of one-third, or three-thirty-sixths, or one-twelfth of the whole to Anthony Wood, in fee ; three-eighth parts of the said two parts of the said one- third, being three-thirty-sixths, or one-twelfth of the whole to George Hopkinson ; and one-eighth part of two-thirds of the same one-third, being one-thirty-sixth of the whole to Francis Alleyn, in fee.\" The manor is now in many shares, and the lords are owners of the mineral duties of lot and cope; and John Charge, of Chesterfield, esq. the steward of the manor, is the sole judge and ar biter of all mineral causes arising within the manor. The manor of Wakebridge belonged at an early period to a family whose ancestor took his name from the place. Peter, son of Ralph de Wakebrugge, married a daughter of Hubert Fitz Ralph, Lord of Crich, in the reign of king John. Sir William de Wakebridge distinguished himself in the wars of France, and is spoken of by Wyrley in his Use of Arms, as being a valiant knight, though he bore colour upon colour in his arms ; he died without issue, in the reign of Edward III. Cecilia, his sister and heiress, brought his estate to her husband, John Pole, of Newborough, in the county of Stafford, by whom she had three sons ; Peter, ancestor of Pole, of Radborne, Edmund, and Ralph whose posterity continued here till the death of his descendant, John Pole, esq. in 1724, when it passed to his great nephew, Garalt Morphy, whose brother and heir, Edward, sold it in 1771 to Peter Nightingale, of Lea, esq. by his bequest this manor passed to his great nephew, William Edward Shore, esq. who has taken the name of Nightingale, and is the present proprietor. The old mansion was taken down about the year 177L but there are still some remains of a chapel. \" Wakeburge, or Wakebridge, was built by Sir William Wakeburge, who was a great bene factor to the church of Crich, as appears by his arms so often set up within the church. He also built a fine chapel at Wakeburge, which he garnished with an organ and other costly devises.\" Harleian Manuscripts. The ancient gothic spire church (which stands above the town) is dedicated to St. Mary. It is very neat and commodious, and has a centre, two side aisles, and a chancel. Lysons states that in the reign of king Stephen, Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, gave this church to Darley abbey, but it is more probable that Ralph Fitz Ralph, first Baron of Crich, in that reign, was the donor. A chantry was founded in this church \" for God's service, and maintaining of poor folk,\" by Sir William de Wakebridge, dedicated to St. Nicholas and St. Catherine : and another, in 1361, was founded by Sir William de Wakebridge, Richard de Chesterfield, and Richard de Tissington, in honour ofthe Virgin Mary. The income of the former was valued, in 1547, at \u00a312. 4*. i\\d. per annum ; the other, at \u00a36. 3s. id. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at \u00a310. 12.. and yearly tenths 13s. Id.

Sir Robert Wilmot, of Chaddesden, is the impropriator of the great tithes ; the Rev. Thomas Cornthwayte, vicar ; and Sir Willoughby Wolstan Dixie, bart. is supposed to be patron of the vicarage. The following document, written between 1766 and 1786, by Mr. John Reynolds, will best illustrate the gift of this church to Darley abbey, and the claim of the Dixie family to the ad vowson. \"Hubert Fitz Ralph (scilicet Hubertus filius Radulfi) in the year 1175, granted to Albin, abbot of Derley, and the canons there, inter alia, the church of Criche, which his father before time had granted them, with all appurtenances thereto belonging (ut earn ita plene et libere et quiete teneant ac habeant sicut earn tenuerunt et habuerunt cum possessionibus illis quas habuit ecclesi\u00e6 die purificationis beat\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 proxime post captionem Willielmi Regis Scoti\u00e6.) And from this time to the general dissolution of monasteries, the abbots of Darley, for the time being, continued patrons to this church. \" The monastery of Darley was dissolved by authority of parliament in 1540, being 31 Henry VIII. and all its estates and possessions were thereby given to the king (see Stat. 31 Henry VIII. cap. 13.) Hence the right of presentation to the vicarage of Crich, as well as the impropriate rectory became vested in the crown, where, I think [[meaning the vicarage] it still remains, for several reasons as will appear hereafter. \" King Henry VIII. (anno regni sui 36) granted to Thomas Babington (inter alia) the tithes of Washington, within the parish of Criche, but nothing is mentioned of the presentation to the vicarage of Crich in this grant. (Tenendas de Rege in capite 36 Henry VIII. p. 51.) \" When, or even to whom, the tithes of the rest of the parish of Crich were granted, namely, Crich, Plaistow, Fritchley, &c. I do not remember ever to have seen, but most likely they were granted to the same Thomas Babington, or else to his son, Sir Henry Babington, or grandson, Anthony Babington, esq. because this Anthony Babington had the tithes of the whole parish of Crich, but whether he had the advowson or right of presentation, I know not, but that would easily be found by searching the Court of Augmentations. The said Anthony Babington sold to John Claye, of Crich, gent, all his lands and tithes in Cryche, alias Cruche, Plaistow, Egge, alias Edge, &c. (what were contained in the grant or grants, I have not seen, as before mentioned) excepting two farms therein excepted (and still known ;) and a fine was passed to perfect the title in Trinity term, anno 27 Elizabeth, 15S4, between John Claye, gent, and Anthony Babing ton and Margery, his wife, deforcients, but no mention is made of the presentation to the vicarage in this fine. The said John Claye, 1st October, 10 James I. 1612, settled all his estates in Cryche, alias Cruche, upon his three daughters, &c. ; but in this settlement deed no mention is made at all of the presentation aforesaid : hence it does not seem that the right of presentation was ever in Claye ; and if so, neither in Sir W^olstan Dixie, nor Sir Edward Wilmott, as both claim under him. The before mentioned Anthony Babington was afterwards found guilty of high treason, against queen Elizabeth (by siding with Mary, queen of the Scots) and executed in September, 1586, and all his estates forfeited to the crown; so that, if the right of presentation was in him, it reverted back again to the crown, whence it came. \" Sundry estates of this Anthony Babington, in our neighbourhood, were granted to Sir Walter Raleigh, (amongst which were the two farms in Crich, which were excepted in Babington's deed to Claye) both of which Raleigh sold ; others [were granted] to Henry, Earl of Kent ; some were enjoyed by Francis Babington, of the borough of Leicester, esq. (brother or nephew to the said Anthony) and by him, and the said Earl of Kent, were sold to divers freeholders about the year 1634, but I never heard that any, claiming under these, pretended to have a right to the presentation. \" Mary, one of the three daughters and co-heirs of John Claye, before mentioned, was wife to Timothy Pusey, of Selston, in the county of Nottingham, esq. and carried this estate of her fa ther's to him, and he enjoyed it in 1646 and lsi_7. Elizabeth, youngest of the three daughters and co-heirs of the said Timothy Pusey and Mary Claye, his wife, married William Willoughby, z z"], [382, "354 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER esq. [son and heir of Sir Rotherham Willoughby, of Muschamp, county of Nottingham] and had a son, Sir William Willoughby, and a daughter, Mary Willoughby, who married Beaumont Dixie, esq. (after the death of his father, Sir Wolstan Dixie) Sir Beaumont Dixie, bart. This Sir Wil liam Willoughby had a son, William, who died an infant before his father, and two natural chil dren, but as these could not inherit, the said Mary Dixie enjoyed her brother's estates (at least this at Crich) and was grandmother to the late Sir Wolstan Dixie [son of Sir Wolstan, the third baronet] and great grandmother of the present Sir Wolstan Dixie, [fifth] bart. This Lady Dixie sold her estate in Crich to one Thomas Morley, a potter. Morley sold several parcels out to di vers persons, and the remainder to Mrs. Millicent Fuller, of Nottingham, widow; and she left it to her grandson, Robert Musters, late of Nottingham, aforesaid, esq. ; and this Robert Musters, and Ann, his wife, in or about the year 1747, sold a part of the same to Dewhurst Bilsborough, an officer of excise, and the remainder to Dr. Willmot, physician to the king, now Sir Edward Willmot, bart. \" Mr. Walker, the present vicar of Crich, has frequently told me that it does not appear from the Bishops' registry at Lichfield, that any Clerk had been legally presented, instituted or inducted to the parish church of Crich since the dissolution of the monasteries. One Bradshaw, I think, it was (who was presented thereto by the then abbot of Derley) being the last there upon record before himself; and he, Mr. Walker, was presented by the Lord Chancellor, who then had the undoubted right (if not dejure, yet pro hac vice) because the living, as I am told, was lapsed. \" From the foregoing account (quam veram esse scio et affit me) I think the right of presenta tion to the vicarage of Crich is actually in the crown, either from the dissolution of monasteries, or else from the attainder of Babington (supposing he had it.\") Arms and Inscriptions in the Church. At the west end of this church, within a pew, is a brass plate to David Woodhouse, who died 27th Feb. 1/49, aged 66 years ; and Mary, his wife, died 3rd July, 1766, aged 75. And above the same is a black marble monument to their two daughters. Jane Woodhouse, died 31st Dec. 1803, aged 73; and Dorothy Woodhouse, died 1st May, 1819, aged 91. In the chancel, on the south wall, there is a neat white marble monument to the son of the above David and Mary. To the memory of David Woodhouse, gent, who died 26th May, 18U4, aged 73. Ann, his wife, died 26th February, 1822, aged 70. On the door of a pew, in the middle aisle, is a brass plate, inscribed \u2014 Robert Alsibrooke, gent, died 20th March, 1771. Susanna, his wife, died 7th December, 1809. Their daughter, Susanna Lawley, died 7th June. 1814. ' On the pavement of the middle aisle is a brass plate to John Kirkland, yeoman, buried here, whose ancestors and he lived at Wheatcroft, in the parish of Crich, above 500 years. Till gentle death did end their days; Yet we will give to God the praise. 1652. From a table of donations over the porch door, it ap- pears that this John Kirkland left 40.. a year to the poor of Crich, to be paid from lands at Wheatcroft. Near to the last brass there is another, in the same aisle, to Robert Marshall, esq. and Margaret, his wyfe, \\\\ ho in this town lived quietly above fifty years with- out debate or stryfe. There are two shields of arms over the arch which di- vides the chancel from the body of the church ; they have been painted, but are hardly visible from the white wash. They appear to be the arms of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick : viz. ARMS of Talbot \u2014 Gules, a Lion rampant within a border, engrailed, Or. SUPPORTERS\u2014 Two Talbots. The other is a lozenge shield, supported by two Stags, j collared, Nothing is to be seen but a sal tier engrailed, and a chief. The ARMS of Hardwick are \u2014 Argent, a saltier, en- grailed, Azure, on a chief of the second, three cinquefoils of the first. The Earl of Shrewsbury had large possessions in Crich, and belonged to the neighbouring manor house and estate of South Winfield. On the right hand side of the chancel is an altar tomb with the effigy of a man resting his feet on a dog traced thereon. On the ledge of the slab is a Latin inscription to Godfrey Berresford, esq. son and heir of Adam Ber resford, of Bentley, esq. and servant to George, Earl of Shrewsbury. He died 29th Nov. 1513. The Arms at the top are nearly defaced, but were ori ginally meant for the Arms of Berresford and Hassall, viz. 1 and 4, Argent, a Bear rampant, Sable, muzzled, collared and chained, Or, Berresford : and 2 and 3 per chevron, Argent and Or, three Pheons' heads, Sable, Hassall. On the wall above the last is Mr. Woodhouse's monu ment, before described. On the left side of the chancel there is an altar tomb of alabaster. The inscription, which is almost defaced, is on the slab at the top; but the name of Clay is to be seen in several places ; and from the arms thereon, it seems to have been erected to a person of the name of Clay, his two wives, and their five children. There are three shields, the middle one is Parti per pale Baron, and two femees per fesse. 1st, Clay.

On the right hand and left of this shield there are two single shields, one of Calton, and the other of Ferrers. The side and end presented to view have five kneeling figures, being children of the above Clay ; over each is inscribed their names, 1st, Susannah; 2nd, Mary; 3rd, Penelope, nupta erat Thomas Brailssord, senior ; and on the end William and Theophilus. This monument to the Clays appears to have been erected to the memory of John Clay, esq. who died in 1632, and Mary, his first wife, daughter of William Cal ton, of Calton, esq.

Wakebridge hall, for many generations the seat of the above distinguished families, is now occupied by Mr. Spendlove, tenant to W. E. Nightingale, esq. CROMFORD, a small market-town, a township, constabulary and chapelry, in the parish and Crumforde, hundred of Wirksworth, is 16 m. N. from Derby, 8 m. N. from Belper, li m. N. from Wirksworth, 9 m. W. from Alfreton, 10 m. S. from Bakewell, 1 m. S. of Matlock Bath, and 142 m. N. N. W. from London. The principal part of the town, and the extensive cotton-mills belonging to Messrs. R. and P. Arkwright, are situate in a deep valley on the south bank ofthe Derwent, enclosed by lofty lime- stone rocks to the north, south and west, e.xcept one street, which runs up the southern hill \u25a0 to the east, an open valley, of some extent, is clothed with the richest herbage. Through this valley the river Derwent flows and the Cromford canal is carried. The new line of road from Derby, through Belper, Cromford, Matlock and Bakewell, to Buxton and Manchester, is of great advan- tage to the town. The new rail-road, which joins the Cromford canal about one mile and a half south of the town, is carried through the north-west part of the Wirksworth hundred, running past the west portion of the High Peak hundred, over a mountainous country, to Whaley-bridge, where it joins the Peak Forest canal. The building of numerous bridges, the forming of inclined planes, erecting steam-engines, and cutting through immense rocks, have been attended with a serious expense; the whole estimated cost, agreeable to the first calculation, being \u00a3 163,000. which sum it will probably exceed before the whole line is opened. The houses and mills are chiefly built of excellent gritsone, procured in the township, and chiefly belong to Richard Ark- wright, esq. The town is eminently distinguished by the founder, Sir Richard Arkwright ; that most ingenious mechanic having established the first cotton-mill, in 1771, erected in the county, and the first upon so large a scale in England. His astonishing and wonderful penetration may be discovered in the very choice of a situation so suitable to carry on his extensive plans and operations, which laid the foundation of that immense wealth now enjoyed by his family. The mills are supplied from a never-failing spring of warm water, which also proves to be of great ad vantage to the canal in severe seasons, as it rarely freezes up, in consequence of a portion of"], [386, "358 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER the water from this spring flowing into it. These mills, and those of Masson, erected a little higher up the river Derwent, belong to, and are worked by, the grandsons of the eminent founder, who employ nearly 800 persons. The valuable lead-mines, the manufacture of red lead, grinding and preparing calaminaris, the wharfs, the canal, and the rail-road, together with the extensive smelting-mills of the Messrs. Alsop, the hat-manufactory and worsted-mills at Lea, which are in the immediate neighbourhood, not only give employment to a numerous and in creasing population, but render the town of great importance in a mercantile view. In 1831, the township contained 233 houses, 257 families, and 1291 inhabitants. Ofthe fami lies, 10 were employed in agriculture, 125 in trade or handicraft, and 122 not included in the two preceding classes. In 1790, Sir Richard Arkwright obtained the grant of a market, which is now held on Satur day. The fairs are held on the 1st of May and the 1st of October. The extent ofthe township is 1348 a. 0 r. 16 p. of limestone and gritstone land, chiefly belong ing to Richard Arkwright, esq. who has considerably improved and beautified the estate by extensive plantations, which add much to the surrounding scenery. The land is watered by the Derwent, Cromford Moor-sough and Bonsall brook ; it is much divided ; every person employed at the mills, capable of purchasing a cow, has a little plot of land allotted to him sufficient to maintain it. The average rental may be stated at 20.. per acre. The estimated annual value of the buildings and land is \u00a33596. 13s. lOd. The average of seven years' poor rates is \u00a3297. 12*. County rates, \u00a354. 15s. 6d. and church rates, \u00a314. 15s. 9d. per annum. The pauper children are chiefly sent to the cotton-mills. There are large Friendly Societies ;* Sunday schools at the church and at the Methodist chapel; an excellent inn and four public-houses ; a water corn mill ; a bridge, repaired at the expense of the county, and a handsome free day-school, built and supported by Richard Arkwright, esq. for boys and girls. Almshouses for six poor widows, &c. in the township. The large handsome inn, erected in the market-place, in 1778, is kept by Mrs. Higgott. Here the London, Manchester, and Nottingham coaches change horses. In Crams orde, there were, at the lime that Doomsday Book ?vas compiled, two carucates of land to be taxed, and it then belonged to the king. The manor of Cromford, at the Conquest, belonged to the king. In 1350, Sir Hugh Meynell, of Meynell Langley, had a grant of free warren in his lands at Cromford, which he held under the Duke of Lancaster. These lands, which are supposed to have constituted what is now the manor of Cromford, were afterwards in the family of Leche, from whom they passed by sale to the Agards. Thomas Agard died seised of it in 1548. From the Agards it passed by sale to Sir William Cavendish. Henry Talbot, esq. of Ronalton, in the county of Nottingham, esq. third son of George, Earl of Shrewsbury, died seised ofthe manor of Cromford in 1596. From Mary, Lady Armyne, his daughter and co-heiress, it passed to Evelyn, Duke of Kingston, descended from her sister Gertrude. The Duke sold it, in 1716, to William Soresby, gent. William Soresby, the grandson, dying unmarried, his two sisters became his co-heiresses : Mary, married William Milnes, esq. and Helen, the Rev. Thomas Munro. Mr. Milnes purchased Munro's moiety: and in 1776, sold the whole to Peter Nightingale, esq. of Lea : of whom it was pur chased, in 1789, by Sir Richard Arkwright, father of Richard Arkwright, esq. the present pro prietor. The church, a plain building of hewn stone, erected on a piece of ground called the green, was begun by the late Sir Richard Arkwright, and completed by the present Richard Arkwright, esq. This chapel was opened for divine service, 4th of June, 1797, consecrated 20th of September in the same year, and endowed by Mr. Arkwright with \u00a350. per annum.

Lady Armyne's Almshouses. \u2014 Dame Mary Armyne, by a codicil to her will, bearing date 14th August, 1662, gave to .the rector or parson of Matlock, county of Derby, for the time being, and to three others, a yearly rent charge of \u00a316. 10_. out of her manor lands and tenements in Crom ford, to be paid quarterly by 40.. a year, to six poor widowers or widows past their labour by age or impotency, and 15.?. a year each for a gown at Christmas. There are six almshouses here, in which these widows (who are appointed by the overseers) reside. It is not known by whom they were built. Mr. Arkwright, the owner of the manor and estate, repairs them, having been pur chased subject thereto, and pays the 40.. a year to each, and si..

Near the upper end of the Dale is a spacious building, erected for the manufacture of cotton by the late Sir Richard Arkwright, and now belonging to his son, who resides in the beautiful demesne at Willersley. This mill is replete with the improved machinery employed in making cotton thread, \" whose operations have been so elegantly described by Dr. Darwin, in a work which discovers the art, hitherto unknown, of clothing in poetical language, and decorating with beautiful imagery, the unpoetical operations of mechanical processes, and the dry detail of manu- factures :\" Where Derwent guides his dusky floods, Through vaulted mountains, and a night of woods, The nymph Gossypia treads the velvet sod, And warms with rosy smiles the watery god ; His ponderous oars to slender spindles turns, And pours o'er massy wheels his foaming urns ; With playful charms her hoary lover wins, And wheels his trident, while the Monarch spins. First, with nice eye emerging Naiads cull From leathery pods the vegetable wool ; With wiry teeth revolving cards release The tangled knots, and smooth the ravell'd fleece ; Next moves the iron hand with fingers fine, Combs the wide card, and forms th' eternal line ; Slow with soft lips the whirling can acquires The tender skeins, and wraps in rising spires ; With quicken'd pace successive rollers move, And these retain, and those extend, the rove, Then fly the spokes, the rapid axles glow ; While slowly circumvolves the lab'ring wheel below. Botanic Garden. The machinery by which the cotton is manufactured, is so complicated in its structure, that a clear conception of its powers, and mode of operation, can only be obtained from a minute inspec- tion of all its parts, both in a state of rest, and in motion. The process by which the raw cotton is prepared for use, will, however, convey some idea of the ingenious mechanical contrivances that are employed to facilitate the production ofthe thread. When the cotton is sufficiently picked and cleaned (an operation that furnishes employment to a great number of women) it is carefully spread upon a cloth, in which it is afterwards rolled up in order to be carded. To the carding machine belong two cylinders of different diameters ; the larger of which is covered with cards of fine wire ; and over, and in contact with it, are fixed a number of stationary cards, that, in conjunction with the revolving cylinders, perform the opera tion of carding. The smaller cylinder is encompassed by fillet cards, fixed in a spiral form ; and"], [388, "360 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER is also provided with an ingenious piece of machinery, called a crank. The spiral roll of cloth before mentioned being applied to the machine, is made to unroll very slowly, by means of rollers, so that it may continually feed the larger cylinder with its contents : when carded, the cotton passes from this to the smaller cylinder, which revolves in contact with the other, and is thence stripped off by the motion of the crank ; not in short lengths, but in continuation ; and having the appearance of a very thin fleece, which, if not intended to pass a second time through the carding machine, is immediately contracted, by passing betwixt a pair of rollers, into what is called a row, or length. The next part ofthe process is that of sizing. The machine by which this is performed has two pairs of rollers, that are placed at a proper distance from each other, and revolve with different velo cities, arising either from the variation of size in the pairs of rollers, from their performing a differ ent number of revolutions in the same space of time, or from both these causes united. When the lengths of cotton are brought from the carding machine, several of them together are applied to the rollers now mentioned ; and the effect produced, is not only that the lengths, thus applied in conjunction, coalesce, and come out single, but also that the fibres of the cotton are drawn out longitudinally, by the different velocities and pressure of the rollers : hence the cotton is now termed a drawing. This process is several times repeated, and several drawings are each time united, by passing together betwixt the rollers ; the number introduced being so varied, that the last drawing may be of a size proportioned to the fineness of the thread into which it is intended to be spun. The cotton is now in a fit state for roving. This operation is performed by passing the last mentioned drawing between two pairs of rollers, which revolve with different velocities, as in the former machine. It is then received into a round conical can, revolving with considerable swift ness. This gives the drawing a slight twisting, and prepares it for winding, which is done by hand, upon large bobbins, by the smaller children. When in this state, the cotton is applied to the spinning machine. Here it is passed between pairs of rollers, which revolving with various degrees of velocity, draw it out, and reduce it to a proper degree of tenuity : at the same time, it is sufficiently twisted by the revolving of spindles upon which bobbins are placed ; and the yarn thus twisted is caused to wind on the bobbins, by the friction of their ends upon laths placed horizontally. These laths have another very essential office to perform, which is that of raising and falling the bobbins, so that the yarn may be spread over their whole length ; otherwise the thread would require to be moved very frequently, as in the case of the common spinning wheel. When thus wound upon the bobbins, the cotton is regarded as ready for use.* * To render this statement of the various processes of the cotton manufacture more intelligible to those who have no previous knowledge of the business, we shall insert an extract from the Life of Sir Richard Arkwright (written, we believe, by Air. Nicholson) as published in Dr. Aikin's Biographical Dictionary. \" The card is a kind of brush made with wire instead of hair ; the wires not being perpendicular to the plane, but all inclined one way in a certain angle. From this description, such as are totally unacquainted with the subject, may conceive that cotton wool, being stuck upon one of those cards, or brushes, may be scraped with another card in that direction, that the inclination of the wires may tend to throw the whole inwards, rather than suffer it to come out. The consequence of the repeated strokes of the empty card against the full one, must be a distribution of the whole more evenly on the surface ; and if one card be then drawn in the opposite direction across the other, it will, by virtue ofthe inclination of its wires, take the whole ofthe wool out of that card whose inclination is the contrary way. \" Spinning is of two kinds : in the one process, the carded wool is suddenly drawn out during the rapid rotation of a spindle, and forms a loose yarn : in the other, the material is spun by a well-known small engine, or wheel, which requires the spinner to draw the material out between the finger and thumb of each hand. If we suppose the ma chine itself to be left at liberty, and turned without the assistance of the spinner, the twisted thread, being drawn inwards by the bobbin, would naturally gather more of the material, and form an irregular thread, thicker and thicker, till at length the difficulty of drawing out so large a portion of the material as had acquired the twist, would become greater than that of snapping the thread, which would accordingly break. It is the business of the spinner to prevent this by holding the material between the finger and the thumb, that the intermediate part may be drawn out to the requisite degree of fineness previous to the twist, and separating the hands during the act of pinching. \" The objects of Mr. Arkwright's improvements were carding and spinning. To effect these by machinery, it was required that the usual man\u0153uvre of the carder should be performed with square cards ; or that cylinders, covered with the kind of metallic brushwork before described, should be made to revolve in contact with each other, either to"], [389, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY 361 The Rock House, the seat of Peter Arkwright, esq. is built on a high limestone rock over looking a beautiful part of the Derwent vale. Mr. Arkwright is now building a school-room, 60 feet by 20 feet, and one story hio-h, to be divided in the centre, one room to be for boys, the other for girls. At Cromford, some years ago, was discovered a number of Roman coins, now in the possession of Charles Hurt, jun. esq. of Wirksworth. Near the road leading from Cromford to Wirksworth, is a mine called Godbehere's Founder in which the following remarkable event occurred at the commencement ofthe year 1797. Two miners, named Job Boden and Anthony Pearson, went into the mine on the morning of the 13th of January, and while they were at work, Boden at the depth of forty- four yards, and Pearson at the depth of twenty, the earth above them, together with a quantity of water, suddenly rushed in, and filled the mine to the depth of about fifty-four yards. The other miners immediately began to draw out the rubbish in search of their lost companions, and on the third day after Pearson was discovered dead, in an upright posture. The miners would now have discontinued their exertions, as there seemed little probability of their labours being of any avail ; but being encouraged to proceed (chiefly by the influence and persuasions of Charles Hurt, of Wirksworth esq.) they at length discovered Boden, about three o'clock in the morning of the twentieth \u2022 and though he had not received any kind of nourishment during the eight days of his confinement he was still living, but greatly emaciated. On being taken out, and treated with proper care, he so far recovered, as to be able to return to his work in the space of fourteen weeks, lived many years, and had several children, one of whom was born within a twelvemonth after the accident. To render the particulars of this extraordinary escape more intelligible, it should be observed that the entrance to the mine is by a perpendicular shaft, forty-four yards deep, from the bottom of which extends a gait, or drift (a passage in an horizontal direction) eight yards in leno-th, at the end of which descends a second shaft (or, as the miners term it, a turn) to the depth of sixteen yards. At the bottom of this is another gait, about twelve yards in length, from the extremity of which another shaft extends to the depth of nearly twenty-four yards. At the top of every shaft a windlass was placed, for the purpose of drawing up whatever might be extracted from the mine ; and Pearson's employment was to draw up to the top of the second shaft, the ore, &c. that was obtained by Boden at the bottom. At the distance of seventy yards from the entrance to the mine was a pool of water, which, though generally containing but a small quantity, had, at the time of the accident, been much increased through wet weather. The ground between the mine and the pool had been under mined in searching for lead ore ; and it is supposed that the additional weight of water over the vacuity, had forced down the earth, which filled the mine to the depth often yards in the second shaft. As the earth that rushed in descended below Pearson's station at the mouth of this shaft, he was consequently jammed in there, and was discovered dead, as already mentioned. The re markable circumstance, that the rubbish did not sink into the mine so low as to reach Boden, but stopped in its descent a few yards above him, may in some measure be accounted for, by obser- card, or to strip, according as their respective velocities, directions, and inclinations of their wires, might be adjusted : and with regard to spinning, it would become an indispensable condition, not only that the raw material should be very nicely prepared, in order that it might require none of that intellectual skill which is capable of separating the knotty or imperfect parts as they offer themselves, but also that it should be regularly drawn out by certain parts, representing the fingers and thumbs of the spinner. The contrivance by which this last means was effected, con- sisted in a certain number of pairs of cylinders, each two revolving in contact with each other. Suppose a very loose thread, or slightly twisted carding of cotton, to pass between one pair of cylinders (clothed with a proper facing to enable them to hold it) and let it be imagined to proceed from thence to another pair, whose surfaces revolve much quicker ; it will be evident that the quicker revolution of the second pair will draw out the cotton, rendering it thin- ner and longer when it comes to be delivered at the other side. This is precisely the operation which the spinner performs with her fingers and thumb ; and if the cotton be then applied to a spinning apparatus, it will be converted into thread.\" From these general principles, the improvements of Sir Richard Arkwright may certainly be deduced ; yet there seems reason to believe, that the former would never have been so clearly stated, unless the machine had been pre viously seen in action. 3 A"], [390, "362 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER ving, that the part of the mine where its fall ended, was somewhat straitened by the projection of a large stone, an obstacle which Boden had often ineffectually attempted to remove. It appears, from a conversation held with the man thus strangely preserved from death, that, after contemplating his horrid situation awhile, during the first hours of his imprisonment, he lay down and slept. On awaking, the idea of perishing for want of food rushed upon his mind, and he recollected that he had four pounds of candles with him in the mine : with these, when pressed by hunger, he endeavoured to appease his appetite ; but after two or three vain attempts to swallow such loathsome food, he desisted ; and the candles were found after his release : his thirst, which he had no means of alleviating, was excessive. Feeling extremely cold, he tried to remove this inconvenience by exercising himself in turning the windlass at the further end of the drift ; but having the misfortune to let the handle fall into the shaft below, he was deprived of this resource. After the space of three or four days, as he imagines, being almost in a state of distraction, he ascended, by means of a rope that hung down, to that part of the mine where the rubbish had stopped in its descent, and, by labouring hard, caused a large quantity of it to fall to the bottom of the shaft. He was employed in this manner, when, at length, he heard the miners at work above him, and by the expedient of knocking with a stone, contrived to apprize them that he was still alive. Though it is evident, from this circumstance, that he retained his senses, he can hardly be persuaded that he was not deprived of them, and fancies that he was prompted to make the signals by some friendly voice, receiving from it an assurance, that if he did so, he should be rescued from his dreadful prison. The signals which he made were heard by the miners about eight hours before they reached him ; and he describes himself as so much terrified by their noise, and by apprehensions that persons were coming to murder him, that he should certainly have destroyed himself, if he had not been closely confined by the earth which he had drawn down, and which so filled the lower part of the shaft, that he was almost prevented from moving. In the midst of the panic that agitated him, he swallowed a considerable quantity of earth, which was afterwards expelled by proper remedies. He complained most that his legs were benumbed and dead ; but their natural heat being restored by friction, no bad consequence ensued. When the accident happened, he was forty-nine years of age, and then weighed upwards of twelve stone ; but imagines that he was reduced to half that weight by his confinement in the mine ; yet, as he was not weighed, this cannot be affirmed with certainty. The anniversary of his deliverance from his subterraneous prison, he regarded as a day of thankfulness and jubilee ; and surely few individuals have had more reason than this man to express their gratitude to a protecting Providence.

It is a township and consta'3ulal7' including part of the village of Edingale, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley, and lies at the southern extremity of the county, about 7 miles from Burton on Trent, and about the same distance from Tamworth and Lichfield ; the latter is the post town. The parish of Croxall contains the townships of Croxall and Catton. The township of Croxall, in 1831, contained 29 houses, 36 families, and 188 inhabitants ; 30 families out ofthe 36 were employed in agriculture, and 6 in trade or handicraft. The extent ofthe township is 1540 acres of good land, on a red marl substratum, watered by the Mease and Trent, namely, 20 acres of wood, one-third arable, and nearly two-thirds meadow and pasture, divided into large farms, at an average rental of about 35s. an acre. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a33462. Thomas Princep Levett, esq. owns the greater part, and is impropriator of the great tithes, which are generally compounded for. The other"], [391, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 363 proprietors are the Rev. S. Holwor thy, Thomas Green, Thomas Hatchett, Charles Mousley, Wil liam Pimm and Thomas Twamby.

The average rate of agricultural labourers is 12*. a week. There is a parochial day and Sunday school, sup ported partly by subscription and partly by a small weekly payment from each scholar. There are about sixty children of both sexes instructed in it. On the south of the church there is a very large tumulus or barrow, which the late owner, Thomas Princep, esq. intended to remove, but on finding, by an excavation which was made, that it contained human bones, ordered it to be closed up again ; and soon after he had it planted. In Crocheshalle Siward had three carucates of land to be taxed. Land to eight ploughs. There are now two ploughs in the demesne, and thirty-five villanes, and eleven bordars, having eight ploughs.

This manor soon after the conquest was part of the lands held by Siward, under Henry de Ferrers. In 25 Edward I. it was held by Roger Brabazon, under Henry, Earl of Lancaster : though Richard Cursun held here a knight's fee in the reign of Henry I. This Richard probably acquired the same by his marriage with Petronella, daughter and co-heiress of W alter de Cam ville. He held four knights' fees in this county, namely, Croxall, Kedleston, Stenson, Twyford and Edingale. He had two sons, Robert, and Thomas, of Kedleston ; which Robert, the eldest son, was of Croxall, and held the same knights' fees in 12 Henry II. His descendants continued to possess this manor, and to reside here till the extinction of the male line, in the reign of Charles I. when Mary, only daughter and heiress of Sir George Curzon (who died in lsi22) brought the manor to Sir Edward Sackville, K. B. afterwards fourth Earl of Dorset. The Dorset family resided occasionally at Croxall. The manor and estate was sold towards the latter end of the last century, by John Frederic, Duke of Dorset, to Thomas Princep, esq. the eminent agri culturist. On the death of his son, Thomas Princep, esq. in 1814, it devolved under his will to his sister's son, Thomas Princep Levett, esq. the present proprietor. This place has been rendered famous by the celebrated agriculturist, Thomas Princep, sen. esq. His valuable breed of long horned neat cattle was for many years greatly admired and much sought after by the surrounding country. In Pitt's Agricultural Report of Staffordshire, he says, \" In May 20, 1794, I viewed the cow stock of Mr. Princep, of Croxall: his land is mostly, but not wholly, in Derbyshire, and therefore more properly belongs to the report of that county. I shall just observe that they are of a long horned breed, and by long attention have been brought to a high degree of superiority : large, thick, heavy and well made, with a pretty good show for milking, and such a disposition to fatten, ' that,' Mr. Princep observes, ' the young stock are obliged to be almost starved by a short pasture, otherwise they run fat and never stand the bull :' cows give upon the average about eight quarts of milk each, which the owner thinks equal, from its superior quality, to a much greater quantity from inferior breeds. Mr. Princep's bull, named Bright, which always has been, and will invariably be kept for his own stock, is a majestic noble animal, large, thick, heavy in the valuable points, with the least imaginable proportion of offal ; with a skin handling soft and sleek. This majestic animal is so gentle and docile, that three or four persons at once may handle him without the least sign of ferocity, or even notice on his part. Bright-eye, the son of Bright, now three years old, is a beautiful and most complete animal, and it requires a person of superior skill to that which I possess, to find a single fault with him.\" Mr. Princep, the great promoter of these fine animals, died August 8, 1 795, aged 64, and was succeeded here by his son, Thomas Princep, esq. who took great delight in the same profitable pursuits : he died without issue on the 1 2th of November, 1814, aged 56, and devised his estate to his nephew, Thomas Princep Levett, esq. The eldest sister of Mr. Princep married The ophilus Levett, of Whichnor, in the county of Stafford, esq. and the second sister married Robinson, of Rydware, in the county of Stafford, esq. The ancient gothic tower church of Croxall, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was given, in"], [392, "364 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 1241, by Robert de Cursun to the priory of Repton, to which the great tithes were appropriated.

CUBLE Y is a small pleasant rural agricultural village, in the deanery of Castillar, and hundred Cobelei, 0f Appletree. It is a township, a constablewick and parish, 7 m. W. of Ashbourn, and 13 m. N. W. of Derby. In 1831, it contained 78 houses, 81 families, and 471 inhabitants! Of the families, 6i were chiefly employed in agriculture, and 1 6 in trades connected therewith, or handicraft. There is no manufacture carried on in this village, but a few young females are employed in figuring bobbin net lace. The parish includes the chapelry and township of Marston Montgomery, which we shall notice in its proper place. William Montgomery, in 1251, obtained a grant of a market, which was held here on Mon- days, together with a fair, for three days, at the festival of St. Andrew. The market has long been discontinued, but the fair is still held on the 30th of November, though it is much on the decline. The township of Cubley is bounded by Stydd, N. ; Marston Montgomery, W. ; Boylston, E. \u2022 Somersall, S.W.; and Sudbury, S. It contains 2300 acres of land, watered by a rivulet' that runs through the lordship, called Cubley Brook ; divided into farms of 200 acres downwards and let at an average rental of 28s. per acre. According to a recent valuation by Mr. Eaton, of Sutton, an experienced valuer, he has rated the township at 23*. an acre. The soil is red marl, watery clay and gravel. The tithes, which belong to the Rector, are taken by composition, and are added to the rental. The Earl of Chesterfield and the Rector are the only proprietors. The average amount of the parochial expenses for seven years, including poor, church, county and constable rates, is \u00a3368. yearly. The inhabitants send their paupers to Tutbury workhouse, to which they contribute, and they are there maintained at a cost of from Is. 8d. to 2s. 6d. each. The pauper children are distributed among the inhabitants. There is one sick club or friendly society, consisting of 90 members, and one public house in the village. In Cobelei, Siward had two carucates of land to be taxed. Land to two ploughs. There are now two ploughs in the demesne, and four villanes, and four bordars, and one bondman, have one plough.

The Ralph who held this place at the Doomsday Survey was probably the ancestor of the Montgomeries (who are known to have held here as early as 1160.) In 34 Henry III.

John Mont gomery, the last heir male, died in 1513, leaving three daughters, co-heirs, one of whom (Doro thy) brought Cubley and other estates to her husband, Sir Thomas Gifford, of Chillington, with whose heiress (Elizabeth) they passed to Sir John Port, of Etwall. Sir John Port had three daughters, co-heiresses, one of whom (Margaret) brought Cubley to Sir Thomas Stanhope, ancestor of the Earl of Chesterfield, who is the lord of the manor and patron of the rectory. The handsome gothic church, dedicated to St. Andrew, has a broad embattled tower surmounted by pinnacles, and ornamented with thirteen shields of the armorial bearings of the Montgomery family and its alliances, and other sculptured devices. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a313. \\6s. 3d. and yearly tenths \u00a3l. 7*- 7%d. and is now worth upwards of \u00a3500. yearly.

George Fletcher, rector of Cubley, informed Stebbing Shaw, the historian of Staf- fordshire, that Dr. Johnson had formerly applied to him for extracts relative to his father and his family, who are registered as natives of this village. Andrew Johnson, uncle of the Doctor, was a celebrated pugilist and wrestler : he kept the ring at Smithfield for some years, and upon the authority of his nephew (the Doctor) it is related that he was never thrown or conquered. Michael Johnson, the brother of Andrew, and father of the celebrated author, Dr. Samuel John- son, first emerged from the obscure occupation of his family, who lived at Cubley as day labourers. He was a bookseller in Lichfield, a man of large athletic construction ; of violent passions, and of a melancholy cast nearly approaching to madness. He married the sister of Dr. Ford, a physician, father of Parson Ford, near the Punch Bowl, in Hogarth's Midnight Modern Conversations. Dr. Samuel Johnson was born at Lichfield, 7th September, 1709- Cubley was the chief seat of the Montgomery family, who had a park there. It was also, for a time, the seat of the Stanhopes ; but the mansion has long since been pulled down. The best, though it is feared but imperfect pedigree of this family, which we have been enabled to procure, is as follows : Sir William Montgomery, living 27 Edward I. anno 1299, was father of Sir Walter, living 1351, whose son, Sir Nicholas, married Eleanor, daughter and heiress of Cheresey,"], [396, "368 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER and died about 5 Edward IV.* ; his son, Nicholas, died in his father's life time, and by Joan, daughter of Sir Nicholas Longford, left a son, Nicholas (afterwards a knight) who was six years old 5 Edward IV.; he married Joan, daughter of John Haddon, esq. and had Sir John, who died 5 Henry VIII. anno 1513; by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Griesley, he had Ralph, who died in his father's life time S.

E. of Calver is a township in the chapelry of Baslow, in the parish of Bakewell, and in the hundred of High Peak. In 1831, this place con tained 69 houses, 77 families, and 277 inhabitants. Of the families, 22 were employed in agricu ture, 32 in trade or handicraft, and 23 variously. Several families are employed at the Calver cotton mills. The extent of this township is 1202 acres of gritstone land, of various qualities, watered by the river Derwent, and divided into small farms, at a rental of from 5s. to \u00a32. an acre. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a3620. 18.?. The average of three years parochial ex penses is \u00a3126. 2s. 2d. The Duke of Rutland is the principal proprietor, and owner of the great tithes ; the other proprietors are Mrs. Gardom, and Messrs. Heygate and Mason. The wool and lamb tithes belong to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield. The moors are uncultivated, but abound in moor game, which is preserved by the Duke of Rutland. This place is in the con stablewick and manor of Baslow, and is governed by a headborough. Near the Upper town of Curbar, about two miles from Eyam, and on a rocky part of the moor, are some gravestones with the initials I C, A C, and several others, dated 1632, of a family of Cooke, said by oral tradition, to have died of the plague ; but as we know this disease raged at Eyam in the year 1666, it is very inexplicable how these should be in 1632. In this township, near the Sheffield road, is a large isolated stone, called the Eagle stone. It appears to have been the work of nature, and is a solid mass, though not without some fissures.

N. of Brampton, is a small scattered village, situate on an eminence which commands the whole vale of Chesterfield: it is a township and constablewick in the chapelry, parish and manor of Brampton, and in the hundred of Scars dale. In 1821, this township contained 72 houses, 74 families, and 315 inhabitants. Of the families, 32 were employed in agriculture, 13 in trade or handicraft, and 29 variously. The acreage of this township is included in that of Brampton, to which place it pays church and poor rates. The estimated annual value of the land and buildings is \u00a31066. 6s. 6d. The principal proprietors are the Rev. Cornelius Heathcote Reaston Rodes, of Barlborough hall (who owns Cutthorpe hall and about 250 acres of land) ; Sir George Sitwell, bart. 250 acres ; Robert Pear son, Charles Newbold, Samuel Hudson, of Wadshelf, Mrs. Barker, of Bakewell, and William Hardwick. The tithes, as parcel of the chapelry of Brampton, belong to the Dean of Lincoln's lessee, His Grace the Duke of Devonshire. The average rental of the land is about 35.. an acre. Cutthorpe hall and estate was purchased by the family of Heathcote in 1614 ; this family had some time previous resided at Brampton. About the latter end of this century Gilbert Heathcote, * This date 5 Edward I V. anno 1465, is too distant from 1351, a period of 114 years, to allow of this man being son of Walter. It would seem by the old church notes, above quoted, that two other Nicholas Montgomeries preceded him."], [397, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 369 of this place, Doctor in Physic, married Frances, daughter of Sir Francis Rodes, of Barlborough, bart. and had Cornelius Heathcote, M. D. whose son, Gilbert Heathcote, succeeded his great uncle, Sir John Rodes, bart. in the Barlborough estate, and took the name and arms of Rodes, as will be seen on reference to the pedigree of Rodes, which we have inserted under Barlborough. The hall, a good old house, erected on a pleasant and commanding site, has, durin^ the last forty years, been, and is now, in the occupation of William Wright, esq. many years Captain of the Chesterfield yeomanry cavalry. Mr. Wright is a younger son of the late Robert Wright, esq. of Great Longstone, in this county, under which place will be found the pedigree and arms of the family. Mr. Wright states, that although Brampton church is only a mile and a quarter from his house the most direct way, that when he goes in his carriage, he has to take a circuitous route of six miles. DALBURY and DALBURY LEES, two small villages forming one parish and constablewick, Delblbl' are in the hundred of Appletree, and deanery of Castillar. Dalbury is 1 m. S. of Trusley, li m. N. of Etwall, 1 m. W. of Radbourn, and 6 m. W. of Derby. In 1831, this parish contained 44 houses, 49 families and 256 inhabitants. Of the families, 36 were employed in agriculture, 6 in trade or handicraft, and 7 variously. The extent ofthe parish is about 1 136 acres, including 36 acres of common or waste land, di vided among sixteen proprietors: viz. E. S.

The land is of a good strong quality, and watered by the Radbourn and Trusley brooks. It is bounded by Etwall S. ; Trusley W. ; Radbourn E. ; and Brailssord N. The estimated annual value ofthe land and buildings is \u00a3l650. 16s. 8d. The average of six years' county, constable and poor rates, is \u00a3258. per annum. The average rental is about 35s. an acre. In Delbibi, Godfrey had two carucates of land lo be taxed. Land to four ploughs.

Dalbury is described in the Doomsday Survey as a hamlet of Mickleover, belonging to the abbot of Burton, and was part of the lands of Henry de Ferrers. Robert de Dun was lord of Dalbury in the time of Henry II. In 25 Edward I. it was held by John Chandos, under Ralf Bakepuze. The manor of Dalbury and Dalbury Lees were, in the reign of Edward II. the pro perty of Sir Richard Holland. 2 Edward III. Robert Holland died and left it to his son John. In 14 Edward IV. Anne, Duchess of Exeter (relict of Henry Holland) left her estate here, which she had ofthe king's gift, to her daughter, Lady Anne. 7 Henry VII. Ralph Pole, of Radbourn, died and left an estate here and at Dalbury Lees, to George, the son of John, the son of Ralf Pole, in which family it continues to this day. After the death of the before named Duchess of Exeter, the manors appear to have escheated to the crown. Sir Samuel Sleigh, of Etwall, who died in 1C79, was possessed of these manors. Sir Samuel's eldest daughter and co-heiress, carried them to her husband, James Cheetham, of Turton Tower, in Lancashire, esq. ; their eldest son, Samuel Cheetham, esq. owned these manors in 1712. On the death of this gentleman and his two brothers, S. P. the estate and manors passed to Rowland Cotton, of Bellaport, in Shropshire, esq. who had married the other co-heiress of Sleigh. On the death of whose grandson, William Cotton, esq. in 182-, the estate here after some time became the property of his nephew, the Rev. Richard Rowland Ward, who, in 1 82-, sold the same to his maternal aunt, Mrs. Cotton, of Etwall hall, who is the present lady of the manor and patroness of the rectory. 3 B"], [398, "370 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The small tower church, dedicated to All Saints, formerly belonged to Trentham priory, in Staffordshire. The advowson of this church passed from the Sleighs to the Cheetbams, and from them to the Cottons, along with the manor. Samuel, afterwards Sir Samuel Sleigh, presented to this living in 1652. In 1749, Humphry Cheetham, of Castleton, in Lancashire, esq. gave to the church of Dalbury a new set of communion plate, consisting of a large silver flagon, a chalice and patine, and \u00a310. to the poor. In 1827, Mrs. Cotton gave to the church a silver patine to add to the communion plate. It is valued in the king's books at \u00a34. 16s. 3d. and yearly tenths 9s. 7$d. The living is now worth about \u00a3300. a year. Mrs. Cotton is the patroness, and her son, the Rev. Charles Evelyn Cotton is the present incumbent.

DALE ABBEY, or the Abbey de Parco Slanlei, also called Depedale, is an extra parochial township, one mile W. of Stanton, one mile N. of Risley, and about six miles and a half nearly E. from Derby, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. The village is situate in a secluded valley, and contained, in 1831, 84 houses, 84 families, and 407 inhabitants, being a decrease on the last census of eleven persons. Of the families, 23 were employed in agriculture, 7 in trade or handicraft, and 54 are not included in the two preceding classes. Of the 113 men above 21 years of age, 82 were employed in agriculture, 17 in retail trade, and 12 framework-knitters. The township is bounded by Stanton E. ; Stanley W.; West and Kirk Hallam W. and N. W. ; and Spondon and Ockbrook S. It contains 1758 a. 2 r. 8 p. of sandy land, tithe free, and of a middling quality, watered by a small rivulet, and divided into farms at an average rental of 28.. an acre.

The estimated annual value of all the build ings and land is \u00a32160. is. 2d. The abbey was, according to tradition, an extensive and magnificent building. It contained several large windows on the north and south sides, and one at the east end, in the chancel, which was very spacious and lofty. The arch is still standing, and displays an elegant specimen ofthe pointed gothic architecture. Some of the offices belonging to the abbey, converted into dwelling houses, are yet remaining, and in the windows of a few there are fragments of stained glass."], [399, "371 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. After the dissolution the site and demesnes of the abbey was leased to Francis Pole, esq. and he purchased the altar, crucifix, organ, gravestones and all the live and dead stock. In 1544, he had a grant of the abbey estate in fee, and the same year conveyed it to Sir John Port, of Etwall, one of the justices ofthe King's Bench. Dorothy, his granddaughter, brought it to her husband, Sir George Hastings, whose representative, afterwards the Earl of Huntingdon, sold it early in the seventeenth century, to Sir Henry Willoughby, of Risley, who died in 1605, leaving three daughters, co-heiresses, one dying without issue, the manor of Dale and the abbey demesnes were held in moieties by the noble family of Grey and that of Dewes, into which the other co-heiresses married. In 1716, Sir Symmond Dewes sold his moiety of the manor and estate to the trus tees of Philip, Earl of Chesterfield, for his son Alexander, father of the first Earl Stanhope. In 1778, the other moiety was purchased ofthe Earl of Stamford, and the whole is now the proper ty of the present Earl Stanhope. The abbey, founded in or about 1204, was surrendered to the crown 20th October, 1539, when their revenues were estimated at \u00a3144. 4*. per annum. Willis says that it was surrendered by John Stanton, the last abbot, and sixteen monks ; but Lysons says, it appears by the commis sioners' accounts of that date (a copy of which was, in a manuscript book, in the possession of the late Sir Joseph Banks) that John Bede, the last abbot, had a pension of \u00a326. 13s. id. and fifteen monks various smaller pensions. Eleven years afterwards the abbey clock was sold for 6s. ; the iron, glass, paving stones and gravestones for \u00a318. and there were six bells, which weighed 47 cwt. The whole number of abbots were sixteen, and the period of their government 312 years, 6 weeks, and 1 day.

But I beseech thee, whosoever thou mayest be who shalt read this, that thou say not of me J presume, in at tempting this little work unattempted by the illustrious men who have preceded us in our path of life ; but that thou accept it, in the disposition in which I compose it. For with no impulse of any levity or temerity, do I commence it, but with true humility and benevolence, that our juniors and others so inclined, may have knowledge of past events done in this place in the days of our forefathers ; which if through neglect, they should not be committed to writing, might be unknown to posterity. Read, therefore, patiently; and when thou shalt have perused it throughout, shouldst thou, in this little work perceive certain things worthy of emendation, be, I implore you, a charitable cor rector and not a presumptuous detecter : for never can he be a judicious emendator, who is, at any time, a sinister interpretator. Yet, as there are many who delight, without cause, to speak ill of the writings of the pious, I, with the invocated grace of the Holy Spirit, unterrified by such barkings against me, after the example of Ulysses towards the voices of the Syrens, will, with a deafened ear, go on persevering to the end. 3. May the Most High cause my name, through the merits of my readers, to be inscribed in the book of the living. To any one desirous of knowing that name, the attainment will be easy, by means of the chapter (or capital) letters, the third distinction of the work being passed over.* CHAPTER II. Concerning the friar Thomas, the abbot John, and his fraternity. 1. HONOURABLE do I esteem it in the opening of my second chapter briefly to compose something in praise of those illustrious men, who received me among them when, on the call of God, I put on the Regular Habit. 2. To what man upon earth ought this work not to praise, whom a life of holiness has conducted to the grave, and whom Christ hath already happily crowned in the heavens ? 3. Being in the middle of the flowery period of boyhood and youth given by my father to the service of God and of his pious Virgin Mother, I took upon myself the sacred habit in this place from the abbot, John Gauncorth, a venerable father, lovely in the eyes of God and men, who had been the especial associate of the blessed Augustine, of Lavendon.-\"* 4. These two shone forth, in their days and in their order, like the morning and evening stars in the firmament of heaven. 5. There were at that time, men belonging to this monastery, who lived before the Lord without enmity, who wore the vestments of the virtues, who had the countenances of the angels, who glowed with mutual affection, and served the Lord Jesus Christ devoutly. 6. Who is there capable of enumerating the virtues of the friar Galfrid of Sawell, of the friar Roger of Derby, or of the rest ? It became such a father to have such sons. 7. Had I the abundant utterance of a Homer or a Maro, language would, I think, be inadequate to declare the magnitude of their virtues. 8. I had been four years or more a member of their congregation, when a noble matron, the Lady Matilda de Sali cosa-Mara, the foundress of our church (whose memory is constantly in our benedictions) came to us from the dis trict of Lindsay ; then aged and full of days : who knowing that the time of her vocation from this world was ap. proaching, had disposed herself to commend her end to God through the prayers of such holy men. Having called them together in her presence on a certain holiday for the sake of discoursing with them ; and mention having been made relative to the earliest inhabitants of this place, she introduced the following narrative into her conversation with us. CHAPTER III. Concerning the Baker who became a Hermit; the first inhabitant of Depedale. 1. C?PEN your ears to my words, my dearly beloved children, said she, and I will narrate unto you a fable:\u2014 no, not a fable ; an event which most certainly came to pass. * Every chapter in the original begins with one of the letters of the author's name; 8T, f\u00a3, <D, ;fW, fJ, \u00a3> ' *\"> *^\u00bb S> \u00bb!\u25a0> \u00ab\u2022 By the third distinction of the work seems to be meant the smaller or Arabic numerals, denoting the division of the chapters into paragraphs. The direction is very ambiguous, but the intima tion is that there are three distinctions : viz. The chapters, the short argument, and the numeral ; and that the third, or numeral, being set aside, we come to the capital with which the text commences.\u2014 This and similar methods of recording their names was not unusual with the monkish writers : in this translation this characteristic of the original is strictly preserved, as is also that quaintness of expression, in which, no doubt, the worthy canon greatly valued himself, and which is in keeping with the facts of his narrative. f In the county of Bucks, near Olney."], [401, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 373 2. There was a baker in Derby, in the street which is called after the name of St. Mary. At that period the church of the Blessed Virgin at Derby was at the head of a large parish ; and had under its authority a church de onere and a chapel. And this baker, otherwise called Cornelius, was a religious man, searing God, and moreover so wholly occupied in good works and the bestowing of alms, that whatsoever remained to him on every seventh day beyond what had been required for the food and clothing of himself and his, and the needful things of his house, he would on the Sabbath-day, take to the church of St. Mary, and give to the poor for the love of God and of the Holy Virgin. 3. And when that he had during many years led a life of such pious exercises as these, and was dear to God and accepted by him, it pleased God to try him more perfectly, and having tried him to crown him with glory. 4. And thereupon it happened, that on a certain day in autumn, when he had resigned himself to repose at the hour at noon, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him in his sleep, saying, 5. \" Acceptable in the eyes of my Son and of me, are the alms thou hast bestowed. But now, if thou art willing to be made perfect, leave all that thou hast, and go to Depedale, where thou shalt serve my Son and me, in solitude ; and when thou shalt happily have terminated thy course, thou shalt inherit the kingdom of love, joy, and eternal bliss which God has prepared for those who love him.\" 6. The man awakening, perceived the divine goodness which had been done for his sake, and giving thanks to God and the Blessed Virgin, his encourager, he straightway went forth without speaking a word to any one ; with know ledge ignorant, to use the expression of St. Benedict : with knowledge, because he had been taught the name of the place ; ignorant, because he knew not where any place of that name might be. 7. Having turned his steps toward the east, it befel him as he was passing through the middle of the village of Stanley, he heard a woman saying to a girl : \" Take our calves with you : drive them as far as Depedale, and make haste back.\" 8. Having heard this, this man, admiring the favour of God, and believing that this word had been spoken in grace, as it were, to him, was astonished, and approached nearer and said, \"Good woman, tell me, where is Depedale?\" She replied, \"Go with this maiden, and she, if you desire it, will show you the place.\" 9. When he had arrived there, he found that the place was marshy and of fearful aspect, far distant from any habi tation of man. Then directing his steps to the south-east of the place, he cut for himself in the side of the mountain, in the rock, a very small dwelling, and an altar towards the south, which hath been preserved unto this day ; and there he served God, day and night, in hunger and thirst, in cold and in meditation. CHAPTER IV. Concerning the tithe of the mill of Burgum (Burrowash) granted to the hermit. I. fHlGHTY in power of that time was a certain man, named Radulph, the son of Geremund, the lord of half the manor of Okebrook, and of Alvaston cum Soka. 2. This lord, having upon some account, returned from Normandy to England, it pleased him to visit his lands and his woods. And it came to pass, on a certain day, seeking amusement, he came with his dogs in order to hunt in his woods at Okebrook, accompanied by numerous attendants, and drew near the spot where lived the man of God ; and, beholding the smoke of fire going up from the cavern of the man of God, he was greatly astonished that any one should have had the audacity to make for himself a residence in that wood without his permission. 3. Coming up to the spot, he found the man clothed in old rags and skins. And when he had enquired of him, how and whence, and for what purpose he had come there ; and when the other had explicitly shown the cause, this same Radulph, son of Geremund, was smitten at the heart, and observing the wretchedness of the man, he granted to him the place, and bestowed upon him the tithe of his mill at Burgum, for his support. And from that time even unto this day hath that tithe remained to the friars who serve God at Depedale. 4. Thus far, the Lady Matilda, aforementioned, continued her narrative. She told us also many other circum stances, which shall be detailed in their proper places. CHAPTER V. How it happened that he changed his place and built the chapel ofthe Blessed Virgin Mary. 1. &ND it came to pass that the old designing enemy of mankind, beholding this disciple of Christ flourishing with the different flowers of the virtues, began to envy him, as he envies other holy men ; sending frequently amidst his cogitations the vanities of the world, the bitterness of his existence, the solitariness of his situation, and the various troubles ofthe desert ; as Humfrid, and many persons now living, understood, and were accustomed to relate to me and to others. 2. This Humfrid, as he often asserted, had been a tenant of the Gomme de la Dale, of whom mention will be made hereafter. 3. But the aforesaid man of God, conscious of the venom of the crooked serpent, did by continual prayer, repeated fastings and holy meditations, cast forth, through the grace of God, all his temptations. Whereupon the enemy rose upon him in all his might both secretly and openly, waging with him a visible conflict. And while the assaults of his foe became day by day more grievous, he had to sustain a very great want of water. \\\\ andenng about the neigh bouring places, he discovered a spring, in a valley, not far from his dwelling, towards the west, and near unto it he"], [402, "374 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER made for himself a cottage, and built an oratory in honour of God and the Blessed Virgin. There wearing away the sufferings of his life, laudably, in the service of God, he departed happily to God, from out of the prison house of the body. CHAPTER VI. Concerning the vision ofthe Cross that appeared to Uthlagus when he was sleeping upon Lynderyke. 1. SUFFER me now to narrate that memorable event, so well known by our forefathers, which about the same pe riod, God deigned to manifest in this place by his immediate ministry. 2. There was one Uthlagus, a very famous man, who frequented these parts, on account of the passage of wayfarers through the forest between Nottingham and Derby : for the whole country between the bridge of Derby and the waters of was at that time covered with wood. 3. And it came to pass, on one of the days of the summer season, this Uthlagus was sitting upon Lynderyke, which is a hill, westward of the gate of our monastery, with his companions amusing themselves around him, when a deep sleep fell upon him. And, while he slept, he saw in his dream, a golden cross, standing in that spot, where the foundation of our church is laid, the top of which touched the heavens ; while the extremities of the arms stretched themselves on each side, even unto the ends of the world. And moreover he beheld men coming from the various nations of the earth, and most devoutly adoring that cross. 4. The man being aroused and awakened from his sleep, called together his companions, and related to them the vision that had been revealed to him from the Lord : and he added and said, \" Truly, my dearly beloved companions, the valley which ye behold below and which is contiguous to this eminence, is a holy place.\" \" Of a truth,\" he said again, \u00ab the Lord is in this place, and I knew him not. Children shall be born and shall grow up, and shall declare to their children the wonderful works that the Lord will perform in this valley. This valley, I say unto you, shall be white with the flowers of the virtues, and shall be filled with delights and with plenteousness. For there shall come, as it hath been revealed to me, from various nations, to worship the Lord, in this valley, and to serve him, until the end of time through the succession of ages. And because our Lord Jesus Christ hath deigned to show to me, a sinner, his secret intentions, so shall ye understand that ye can no longer have in me, either a companion or a leader ; but aided by his grace, I will amend my life according to his will.\" 5. Then embracing them every one, he turned himself away from them ; but whither he went, nought was known at that time concerning him. 6. Some there were, who said that he went to Depedale, and there in secret intercourse served the Lord, and with a peaceful end came to rest in the Lord. CHAPTER VII. Concerning the noble Matron who was called \" the Gomme of the Dale,\" and of Richard her son. 1. SJoMINUS de Bradleye, the lord of Bradleye, by name Serlo de Grendon, a soldier intrepid in arms, illustrious by the eminence of his race, received Margery, the daughter of the aforesaid Radulph, the son of Geremund, as his wife, and with her, the half of the manor of Okebroke, in free dowry. 2. By her he had three daughters : namely, Johanna, Isolda, and Agatha ; to whom (with grief be it spoken) the inheritance ultimately descended. 3. He also begat five sons : Bartholomew, who was afterwards a canon with us ; William, of cherished memory, our advocate ; Fulcher, Jordan and Serlo. 4. Afterwards he married Matilda, noble by family, but still more noble by conduct, the Lady of the manor of Celston. 5. By her he had Andrew of Grendon, and Ranulph, the Lord of Boteston ; with their brothers, wh owere soldiers. 6. He also had Robert by a concubine, who was more powerful in arms than the others. 7- In that time the Grendons of that generation were men of power, the most famous of the earth. 8. Now, the Serlo, already named, had a friend who was also his spiritual mother, in so much she had vowed for him in his name at the Holy font, 9. To her the Lord Serlo assigned the place of Depedale with all that appertained thereunto, that she might dwel) there, with the whole of the land, cultivated and waste, which is between the pathway which extends from the northern part of Boyhawe towards the west, even unto Le Colkeysicke and Brunesbroc. 10. And because such spiritual mothers are in English, called Gommes (or Godmothers) this lady herself, was known by the vulgar denomination of Gomme of the Dale. 11. She had a son named Richard, a youth of good disposition ; whom, when he had studied the sacred writings, and after that he had duly taken holy orders, she caused to be ordained a priest, with the purpose that he should assist in divine service in her chapel of Depedale : and such ministry he performed. 12. And moreover the mansion of this same matron, was on the higher land eastward of us, inclining to the south, where there is now a pond, which is called the pond of Roger de Alcsby. 13. When our fathers dug out that pond, they found at the bottom many wrought stones, which had formerly be longed to the abovementioned mansion."], [403, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 375 CHAPTER VIII. Concerning the arrival ofthe Black Canons de la Kale. 1. Cs VEN at that time, when the House of Kale had been the mother of the church of Repyndon, God, who disposes all things, being willing more gloriously to exalt the place of Depedale, the aforesaid Serlo de Grendon called together the canons of Kale, and gave them the place of Depedale ; the venerable matron, abovementioned, having consented thereto, or rather having solicited for their coming. 2. And the chaplain, Richard, took the habit of the regulars among them. Moreover (as Humfrid of whom I have made previous mention, hath told me) the Prior of those very canons was called Humfrid. He had two associates Nicholas and Symon, who had been, a short time before, school-fellows and companions of William de Grendon ; besides the chaplain Richard, just named, and two others, whose names have escaped my memory. This same Hum frid, with his canons, continued through days and years in this condition. 3. These aforesaid canons having taken root in this soil, and being comforted by God, they built for themselves a church, a costly labour; and other offices. 4. Humfrid also, their prior, visited the Roman see, and obtained a most valuable privilege, which we still hold in our possession, relative to a confirmation of the right of sepulture, a chantry, the laying of interdiction upon land, and many other liberties. 5. About the same time flourished Albinus, abbot of Derley, brightly manifesting so many of the requisites of a holy and virtuous life, that the interior of the cloister and of the church, and the most inward sanctuary of religion may be perceived to this day to be redolent with the fragrance of such a father. 6. Then began, not those only of the race of the Grendons, but many others, noble and simple, to frequent the place of Depedale, to endow it largely with their goods, and at their decease, to leave their bodies to be buried there. I have heard it said by a man of veracity worthy of belief, that more than four hundred warriors lie buried in that place, setting aside others of the nobility and gentry, and a prodigious number of common people. 7. In the same spot reposes, Peter Cook, of Batheley, a hermit of that place, a man of sanctified memory. Of whose holy conversation, with which in part, I was myself acquainted, and of whose actions revealed in full confidence by himself and by others, mention shall be made, by the aid of God, in my future works. And thus devout honour and reverence are due to the place itself, on account of its own sanctity, and on account of the bodies of Christ's faithful people who repose there. CHAPTER IX. Concerning the departure of the Black Canons. 1. jM ANY were the circles of the years during which the aforesaid canons remained together in this appointed place, in distant congregation from the social intercourse of mankind ; and to them, thus secluded, the pleasant as pect of the spot was delightful, and they began to hold themselves more remissly to the service of God, and to the observance of order. For they frequented the forest more than the church ; were more intent upon the amusement than the improvement of their minds ; and to hunting than to prayer or holy meditation. And, the whole of the neighbouring country being then a royal forest, as has already been stated, the king hearing of the trespasses they committed, ordered them to be removed from the place, for the preservation of his deer. 2. Then, they, resigning every thing they possessed into the hands of their patron, returned to the place from whence they came, and which they were by necessity compelled to do; but their prior, Humfrid, betook himself to Le Magdalen, and there for many days he lived the life of a hermit. 3. Truly for my own part, I cannot believe that all this came to pass accidentally, but that it proceeded by the will of him, without whom, not the leaf of a tree, nor a sparrow falleth to the ground. O the height of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable are his ways ! For who hath known the design of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor ? 4. But the place which he had chosen, the Lord would not leave thus desolate ; for \" Ludit in adversis divina Potentia rebus.\" Little by little his clemency began to stretch forth the hand of compassion to greater and more wonderful things ; so as that having plucked up the sycamores, he might plant cedars ; instead of the Black Pr\u00e6monstratensians, who had quitted the place, leading hither and establishing the White Pr\u00e6monstratensians, as will be presently declared after the next chapter. CHAPTER X. Ofthe coming of the Canons of Tupholme, and of their departure. 1. 2FERILY there came from Tupholme, which monastery is of our order, six canons, to tarry at Depedale, being invited by the Advocate of the place."], [404, "376 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 2. And there was given unto them the park of Stanleye, in addition to their possessions ; but by whom and in what manner, I know only in part, and altogether with uncertainty ; and to write uncertain things for certain in matters where the truth of any affair is to be treated, I hold to be absurd. 3. This, indeed, I know most certainly, that a convert Friar, who came with those of Tupholme, was the first who constructed the water-mill in the park, and completed the pool with great labour and trouble. 4. Their prior was named Henry. It was necessary for them to be, as indeed they were, extremely laborious ; for they were much incommoded by the frequent visits of the keepers of the forests, and of others ; nor did they possess any cultivated land, which had previously belonged to the Gomme de la Dale, already mentioned, and Makkcmore, which contained one small hide of land. The Lord of Okebroke retained for himself in his lordship, the serfs and the mansion of Boyhawe, which was situate in a field, now called Boyhawe meadowe. \u00bb_._ ..._.._._.. _- ........... , _ , \u2014 ._ _ 5. When they had sojourned here, for the space of seven years, in great poverty, they sold the upper timber ofthe oaks of the park, which they felled at the middle of the trunks, and having received the money, they returned to Tupholme ; their abbot having recalled them. 6. As for the aforesaid Henry, their prior, he was very cunning in the fabrication of false money, having exercised himself in that unhappy trade ; he went from them to Toftweyth, and there cohabited with a certain young woman of Morleye, whom he had previously known with the insane affection of filthy lust. 7. His abbot having heard of this, and being displeased, that he had neglected to return home with the brethren, at his command, sent persons of the monastery and others with them, to bring him to Tupholme by force, that his disobedience and incontinence, as well as his other crimes might be punished, as they deserved, according to the or dinances of the monastery. He being seized with great affliction of the heart, was so instigated by diabolical resolu tion, that in a hot bath, he bled himself in both arms, and thus, by a spontaneous or rather an insane death, he ter minated his life. CHAPTER XI. Concerning the arrival ofthe Canons of Wellebeck, and of their departure. 1. 5 OLITARY, stained and sallow, sat that daughter of Sion, the church of Depedale, bereft, for a period, of in. habitants ; but the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, who had in his pity selected that place, again looked down upon it with an eye of clemency, and consoled it. 2. Therefore, lest that place, beloved by God, and venerable to man (the name of which, through the prerogatives of its merits is, as it were, honey melting in the mouth) should any longer be defrauded of its religious observances, he sent and caused five canons of Wellebeck, of the Pr\u00e6monstratensian order, to be brought hither. 3. Their prior was named * (under the abbot, Richard de Sewelle; their prior being a man esteemed ex pert in civil and religious affairs, and was afterward appointed prior to their establishment at Wellebeck) and there was also the friar, William of Hogneby, then a canon of their church, but afterwards a prior of this holy congrega tion, who, when I took the habit of the order, was accustomed to relate to us many circumstances respecting himself, for our edification. 4. These five persons remained here, in all the severe discipline of their order, for five years, in the greatest poverty, having endured, in that space of time, many and varied calamities. 5. And it came to pass, that on a certain day, one of them being desirous to draw up the lamps which were sus pended before the altar, they all, falling to the ground, in a wonderful manner, were broken into fragments. The prior being called into the auditory, and having received permission to speak, said, amongst other matters \u2014 \" Let us depart hence, since that nothing happens prosperous to us, but all things go contrary to our hopes : and truly I de clare that the Lord hath judged us unworthy of this place, or perhaps hath reserved us for other and better things.\" And that his words became the true prophecies of what was to happen, as the conclusion of this affair will show, the following chapter will set forth. 6. A short time afterwards, the abbot, already mentioned, came to Depedale, as he had done before, for the purpose of visiting his friars, being desirous that all things should be right with them. And he found them enduring a life of severe poverty, possessing very little corn or meal, and still less flesh meat. 7- The man of God, commiserating their distress, declared that he felt himself to have been unkind and unjust, in so much that his brethren were perishing with hunger and wretchedness in the desert, while he might have provided them sufficiently with necessary food and clothing, at home, as was required by their regulation and order. 8. And when he had returned to his monastery, he discussed the matter seriously with the brethren, and taking the advice of the most prudent, he called home the aforesaid brethren who were sojourning at Depedale. CHAPTER XII. In what manner the manor of Staneleye, with its parish, was given lo the Canons of Newhouse, by Gals rid de Salicosa-Mara and Matilda his wife. 1- \u00ab- O-EXISTENT with these events, it came to pass that William, the son of Radulph, of whom I have already made mention, purchased the manor of Staneleye, from Nicholas, the son of William Chylde, of Trowell, performing his service of the fourth part of the arming of one soldier, during sculage. * This word is not distinct in the manuscript, but seems to be Boniface."], [405, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 377 2. This same Nicholas held Trowell, Broculstowe, Bramcote and Staneleye of the Lord of Kyme, by the tenure of one scutage ; each of which manors were assessed to find one fourth of a scutage. 3. And the aforesaid Nicholas held many other lands : namely, Claxton, Hewes, Leka and Stanford ; of which it is best at present to say nothing, because they have no relation to the matter of which I am treating. 4. The said William, indeed, had known that the manor of Staneleye was given to Galfrid de Salicosa-Mara, who had espoused his daughter, Matilda. Then did these two, Galfrid and his spouse Matilda, having made a vow to God, present themselves before their superior lord, saying, \" Thou knowest, my lord, that we have lived together in wedlock for these seven years and more ; and that God hath deprived us of the fruit of our marriage bed, and that we are without the comfort of children. And therefore we earnestly beseech you, that with respect to the manor of Staneleye, which you have proposed to bestow on us, that you consent that we offer it to God, and confer it upon the abbot of the religious order of Pr\u00e6monstratensians, who are founding a monastic house in your park ; and may God, the most High, the retributor of good deeds, looking down upon the pious devotion of your humility, grant to us the blessing of wished-for progeny, and on account of this benefaction, grant to us and to you the bliss of eternal life.\" 5. Then this nobleman understood that their hearts and counsels were inspired by God, and, accordingly benefi cently yielding to their just and virtuous petitions, he caused William de Grendon, a priest, the son of his sister, and lord of Okebroke, to be called to him, and said to him : 6. \" I purpose to build a certain monastery of the order of the Pr\u00e6monstratensians, by the advice of my friends, in my park at Staneleye ; a place which is contiguous to that of Depedale, of which you are the patron, and where three congregations of different men have successively flourished ; all of whom being attacked and driven away by intolerable poverty, have left the spot desolate. And I most truly am persuaded that you will bestow that place upon my new establishment ; so that between me and thee, we may provide out of our lands, possessions and goods, which God hath granted us (should God grant us length of life) that the religious men, who shall be called thither, may not be compelled by necessity to beg or to change their situation.\" 7. To whom William de Grendon replied, \" Blessed be the name of the Lord, who hath inspired you with so pious a purpose ! and blessed by God may they be who have given you this counsel ! So may you speedily take in hand, happily in the name of the Lord, that which thou hast in thy mind, if it so pleaseth thee, particularly as men are so frail and mortal. And I will bestow the place of Depedale and all the appurtenances which are mine to grant; and never at any former period were the inhabitants of that place, whether black or white canons dwelling there, located there with more certain hope of fruitful grace. Yet 1 grant this place on one condition, that a priest of that congre gation shall every day, in perpetuity, within the chapel of Depedale (which they must keep in repair) celebrate mass for my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors, and for the souls of all those that are at rest in Christ ; and, further, that upon the great table in the Refectory there shall be placed, one loaf of conventual bread, beer, and money,* to be distributed to the poor.\" 8. The nobleman, his uncle, answered him with thanks for his concessions, and said, \" And I also will command and effect that all these things shall be inviolably executed, in perpetuity. And since I, being occupied both beyond sea and on this side of the sea, in the business of the king, cannot find time to attend to the foundation of the monas tery proposed in this matter, I have granted the superintendence to Galfrid de Salicosa-Mara, and to Matilda, my daughter, his wife, and I appoint them my executors in this matter ; namely, the foundation of the monastery and the recalling of the canons.\" CHAPTER XIII. Concerning the arrival ofthe Canons at Newhouse. 1. siND having received charters and other instruments necessary for the foundation of the monastery from the aforesaid nobleman William, the said Galfrid and Matilda went at his command to Newhouse, that they might thence lead forth a convent.-^ 2. For there were men in that monastery fragrant with the flowers of the virtues, so that they had the rose of the firmest patience, the lily of chastity, and particularly the violet of the contemplation of celestial life : whom the sin cerity of life and virtue of manners so honoured, that from sea to sea, throughout all the districts of the English kingdom, their sanctity sent abroad its odour. 3. Then the aforesaid Galfrid and Matilda, arriving at Newhouse, found there the abbot, Lambert by name, a man ofthe highest prudence, true to his word, Justin his judgment, provident in counsel, faithful in his trust, determined in his discipline, conspicuous in beneficence, and illustrious for the universal virtue of his conduct. Who so instructed his monks in the sweetness of celestial intercourse, that I may truly say with the Apostle, \" Our conversation is in heaven.\" 4. Galfrid and Matilda being honourably received by the aforesaid venerable father, and having explained their business and the cause of their coming, the abbot, having held a council with the brethren, granted to them that they should lead forth nine canons to Depedale, and establish the order in that place. 5. Amongst these were \u2014 Walter de Totenaye,^: a man of the highest piety, who previously, proceeding to two other places, namely, to St. Agatha and the convent of Newhouse, had founded there the same order ; also John of Byford, * Companagi, meaning forest dues, and may mean money to enable them to pass through the forest, or wood for firing. -f- Convenlus, an agreed body of monks. \u00a3 Walter de Steteneye is the first abbot named in Dugdale's Monasticon. 3 c"], [406, "378 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER the son of Baldwin of Byford, who was the associate of Peter de Gausila, who also was one of the founders of New. house, and Hugh of Grymmesby, and Roger of Alesby ; and William le Sores, men of virtuous lives and of great piety ; together with other men of God. 6. These, O Dale, were thy living stones, thy chosen stones, the stones precious in the foundation of thy church ; which stones are jointed with that mighty corner-stone, our Lord Jesus Christ. On the ninth chapter of this Chronicle is founded the Legend of Dale. Abbey, published in a volume of Poems, the compositions of William and Mary Howitt of Nottingham, whose writings are celebrated for their simple and yet brilliant powers of description. In this Legend there is much wildness and vivacity. The foundation of the story is laid as well in this Chronicle as abridged by Pilkington as on some information furnished by the Rev. Robert Wilmot, of Morley, to that historian, to the following effect. \" One ofthe windows ofthe church at Morley consists of painted glass with inscriptions, which are plainly designed to record some remarkable event. The glass was brought from Dale abbey, when it was dissolved, and was intended, to convey an idea of the following circumstances. According to tradition, the keepers of the park or forest, being disturbed by the encroachments of the monks, carried their complaints to the king. And with a view of representing this fact they are painted upon the glass in green habits, standing before him, with this inscription, ' whereof we complain unto the king;' when they received this answer, ' go and tell them tjfkWw me.' In another part of the window, the person, against whom the complaint is lodged, appears kneeling before the king. With a view of adjusting the matter in dispute, and giving satisfaction to both parties, the king, it is said, granted to the canons at Depedale, as much land as betwixt two suns could be encircled with a plough, drawn by deer, which were to be caught from the forest. This is expressed by two other inscriptions. ' Go, take them, and tame them.' ' Go home, take ground witli the plough.' We find that this deter mination of the king was afterwards carried into execution. For upon the glass is painted a man with a plough drawn by deer, with these words underneath : \" Here St. Robert plougheth with them.' What extent of land was encompassed in this way cannot now be ascertained. But it is probable, that it comprehended the precincts ofthe abbey, or the whole liberty of Dale \" We have not room for the whole Legend, but the commencement affords, as the authors have themselves pointed out in their Notes, \" a curious portraiture of eremitical ancl monkish life.\" This suits our purpose, and we doubt not that the extract will be highly gratifying to many of our readers. \" This story,\" remark the authors of the Legend, \" and the confirmation so ingeni ously drawn from the painted glass by the Rev. R. Wilmot, sufficiently show what credence we may give to popular tradition, and the fondness of antiquarians for illustrating local history by old relics ancl remains in general. It so exactly resembles circumstances in the history of St. Robert of Knaresborough, of deer-taming renown, that we cannot avoid suspecting it to have originated in it. The tradition, however, is current, and as such we have used it. \" J he cave, originally scooped by the hermit, is still entire. It is cut in a precipice which stands pleasantly elevated above the valley, and overhung with wood, in full prospect ofthe fine, lofty, remaining arch of the abbey. It is one of the most picturesque and perfect hermitages re maining in this country, though probably not less than seven hundred years old, the abbey itself being founded in 1204.\" \" The devil, one night, as he chanced to sail In a stormy wind, by the Abbey of Dale, Suddenly stopp'd, and look'd wild with surprise, That a structure so fair in that valley should rise: When last he was there it was lonely and still ; And the hermitage scoop'd in the side of the hill, With its wretched old inmate his beads a-telling, Were all could be found of life, dweller, and dwelling. The hermit was seen in the rock no more ; The nettle and dock had sprung up at the door ; And each window the fern and the hart's-tongue hung Within, 'twas dampness and uakedness all : When haymakers sought it to 'scape from the shower, Was scored by their forks in a thousand scars, Wheels and ovals, circles and stars. But, by the brook, in the valley below, Saint Mary of Dale ! \u2014 what a lordly show ! The abbey's proud arches and windows bright, Glitter'd and gleam'd in the full moonlight. He perch'd on a finial to ponder the scene, When he heard, loudly chanted, a chorus within : The strain was so merry he could not help peeping To see how their vigils the fathers were keeping ; Wot ye they sung in the cold chapel's gloom ? Nay, they sate in the glow of the abbot's own room. Saw he beads, and crosses, and visages pale ? I trow ye not, but full flagons of ale ; And the abbot himself, in his lordly chair, Bore a hearty good part in this godly air.\" The Virgin, as fair and holy a block As ever yet stood in a niche of a rock, Had fall'n to the earth, and was broke in the fall.

But troth ! if I yet have a subject on earth, I'll spoil their hunting ! \u2014 111 mar their mirth !' He flew to the keepers \u2014 the keepers they pace Away to Sir Gilbert, the lord of the chase ; Sir Gilbert de Grendon he sped to the king, And with grievous complaints made his proud palace ring: How the friars at Dale forsook missal and mass, To chant o'er a bottle, or shrive a lass; No matins' bell call'd them up in the morn, But the yell of the hounds, and the sound of the horn ; No penance the monk in his cell could stay, But a broken leg, or a rainy day ; The pilgrim that came to the abbey door, With the feet of the fallow deer found it nail'd o'er; The pilgrim that into the kitchen was led, On Sir Gilbert's venison there was fed, And saw skins and antlers hang o'er his head. The king was wroth, and ivith angry tone He order'd St. Robert before his throne: St. Robert appear'd in three weeks and a day, For hot was the weather, and long was the way, He spoke so wisely, he pleaded so well, That the king, in sooth, had trouble to tell Which of the two that before him came \" Old Father John was a holy man, And he chanted a mass full well; But his cheek was pale, his heart did fail, The cause pray who can tell ? Oh ! well might the heart of the father fail, For it never was warm'd with a flagon of ale ! \" Saint Benedict in his conscience was prick'd, And full soundly he lash'd his skin ; But father Peter, he never would batter A temple that God dwelt in : Father Peter was right, quoth friar Paul, For thus keeping up God's temple wall. \" Holy Saint Bevil, to quell the devil, Did evermore fast and pray ; But Peter arose, with ponderous blows, And furiou'sly drove him away. Then here's to the arms that made Peter prevail, A venison pasty and flagon of ale ! *-' The devil he heard, the devil he flew Away in a whirlwind, that tore as it blew, Rocks and houses, vast forests of oaks, And buried some hundreds of cattle and folks. Then chatter'd each pane in those windows high, As the fiend arose in the act to fly ; Then a terrible gust did those towers assa^y As the fiend set off from the Abbey of Dale; \" He summon'd his imps in the height of his spleen, And question'd, how many at Dale had been ; And what were the doings might there be seen? One had seen plenty of beef and beer; One had been with the friars a-chasing the deer ; One had carried out venison to twenty good wives, And had wonder'd to see the monks handle their knives, O'er the smoking hot pasties and sparkling ale, By the snug evening fires in the village of Dale. Many had been at a maid's confessing, And some, when St. Robert conferr'd his blessing On pious old souls, that to heaven would sail By giving their lands to the Abbey of Dale. Some, ofthe shrine of our lady told, Of the relics, and jewels, and coffers of gold ; But all of them dwelt on the bountiful cheer, How jocundly flew the whole round of the year, But chief when the monks were a-chasing the deer. To the forest and deer had the fairest claim : But the devil, who sate behind the throne, At that did inwardly writhe and groan; And whispcr'd into the royal ear, ' St. Robert is famous for taming of deer.' Then sprang the king gaily up from his throne, And spoke that fancy, and deem'd it his own ; * For taming of deer St. Robert is famed ; Go catch the wild stags, and get them tamed ; With wood, water, and game, as much forest ground As with such brave steed., thou canst plough round While two summer suns through the heavens do sail, Shall for ever belong to the Abbey of Dale : But if set those two suns ere thou circle the same, They shall cancel for ever and ever thy claim.* Sir Gilbert frown'd \u2014 St. Robert look'd gay; But the envious devil went laughing away.'1 Deeds relative io the donations io Dale Abbey. 1.

DARLEY ABBEY, anciently celebrated as a religious house, has become a large manufactu- Derley, ring village. It is situate in a valley on the western bank of the Der- went, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, and in the parish of St. Alkmund, Derby. The distance from Derby is about a mile northward. In 1831, it contained 172 houses, occupied by 196 families, composed of 487 males and 683 females, making together 1170 inhabitants. Of these families, 1 92 were employed in trade, manufacture and handicraft, and 4 in agriculture. Of the 220 males exceeding twenty one years of age, 130 were employed in the manufacture of cotton, paper and lead, 27 in agriculture,27in retail trades, and 29 retired tradesmen, superannuated labour- ers, &c. There are six stocking-frames in the village. The whole township contains 324 a. 2 r. 28 p. of very good land, consisting of loam and marl, watered by the Derwent, and divided into small farms, at an average rental of 50s. per acre. There are twenty-six acres of wood and orna- mental plantations, and twelve acres of arable land : the remainder consists of pasture and meadow. The soil is excellent. It is bounded by Breadsall and Little Chester, E. ; Allestree, N. ; and St. Alkmund's S. and W. There are five resident and thirteen non-resident freeholders. The prin- cipal proprietors are Walter Evans, Robert Holden, Francis Mundy, William Newton, Edward Strutt, Richard Leaper, Henry Cox, and Thomas Bridget, esqrs. Right Hon. Lord Scarsdale, Rev. Joseph Sykes, the Misses Mainwaring, Miss Cockayne, Mr. Moses Harvey, Henry Welch, Mrs. Palmer, John Walters, and Nathaniel Horsley. The estimated annual value of all the buildings and land is \u00a31934. 11*. 4a!. The average of seven years' parochial expenses is \u00a380. It is a chapelry and constabulary, and finds its own surveyor of the highways. There is no work house, and the pauper children as soon as they are able to work are chiefly employed at the cotton"], [410, "382 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER mills without being apprenticed. There are two friendly societies, viz. one male, consisting ot 155, and one female consisting of 80 members. Before the passing of the beer bill there was no public house in the township. During several years past the village has been gradually enlarged, and its appearance greatly improved, by the Messrs. Evans, whose extensive mills are situate on the Derwent. This village originated in the establishment of a priory of Austin canons, translated to this place from St. Helen's, at Derby. The land had previously belonged to Hugh, Dean of Derby, who gave it to Albinus, abbot of St. Helen's, for the erection of a church and habitation for him self and his canons. He also endowed this establishment with his patrimonial estate in Derby, together with the patronage of the church of St. Peter, and all its appurtenances. This grant was subsequently confirmed by charters of the burgesses of Derby and of Henry II. Among its valuable endowments were the churches of St. Michael and St. Werburgh, the school at Derby and the churches of Crich, Pentrich, Ashover, Winfield, Bolsover and Scarcliffe, in the county of Derby, and Uttoxeter, in the county of Stafford, with all their emoluments and privileges. The manors bestowed upon this religious house were very numerous, and many parcels of land in different parishes were given by pious persons at various periods. The abbot enjoyed some pecu liar privileges : all his lands in tillage, and, indeed, his other property, were exempted from pay ing tithe : he was dean of all the churches in this county that had been bestowed upon his monas tery, but moie especially of those in the town of Derby. He was empowered to hold a chapter ofthe secular clergy. The entire manors seem to have been Ripley, Pentrich, Oakerthorpe, Dethicke, Ible, Tansley, Wessington, Crich, Lea, Hognaston, Souchthorn, Aldwark and Smalldale. The parcel-lands were in Chilwell, Annesley, Blackwell, Kildulvescot, Newton, Hardwick, Burley, Horsley, Ock brook, besides a manse in Nottingham and two mills in Derby. This religious house also held by patents sundry tenements in Derby, Alvaston, Normanton, Wessington, Crich, Haslewood, Duffield, Litchurch, Weston, Mugginton, Spondon, Chaddesden, Little Chester, Thurlston, Am baston, Ripley, Waring-green and Codnor.* In 1271, Robert de Sacheverell passed a sine before John de Rygate, the king's justiciary, for the settling of the church of Boulton upon the Abbot of Darley and his successors, reserving to himself the presentation of a fit chaplain, who was to receive the small tithes of Boulton for his * At Darley belonged to the abbey four plough-gates of land, six acres of meadow, and two corn-mills ; at Alles- tree, one messuage, two cottages, three ox-gangs of land, and eighteen-pence annual rent ; at Mackworth and Mark- eaton, three shillings rent, and a meadow ; at Osmaston, one messuage, sixty acres of land, and ten acres of meadow; at Litchurch, one messuage, and twenty-three acres of land ; at Alvaston, one messuage, two cottages, six tofts, thirty acres of land, and thirteen of meadow ; at Aldward, five ox-gangs of land, three acres of meadow, and a rent of three shillings; at Wigwall, one messuage, and eighty acres of land ; at Alport, three messuages; at Yolgrave, one ox-gang of land ; at Wirksworth, one messuage, and one ox-gang of land ; at Butterley, one messuage and five parks, forty acres of wood, and two woods called Harthay and Lea ; at Ripley, twenty-four messuages, eight cottages, forty ox-gangs of land, and WaingrifFe-field ; at Pentrich, fourteen messuages, six cottages, forty-two ox-gangs of land, and six shillings and eight pence rent ; at Crich, two messuages, four cottages, and five ox-gangs of land; at Horsley, one corn-mill, one toft, four cottages and one croft ; at Wessington, one capital messuage, and eight other messuages, seventeen ox-gangs of land, and six acres of meadow, twenty-six acres of wood, and ten shillings rent ; at Glapwell, two messuages, one cottage, eight ox-gangs of land, four acres of meadow, and seven shillings rent ; at Ogston, rent of ten shillings and seven pence ; at Scarcliffe, one capital messuage, two cottages, and four acres of land : at Palterton, one pasture, and fifteen acres of land ; at Bolsover, one messuage, one toft, and four acres of land; at Ulgarthorpe, rent of twelve shillings and four pence, and Long-croft close ; at Normanton, one capital mes- suage, a toft of land, a small close, three ox-gangs of land, six acres of meadow, and three shillings rent ; at Thurls- ton, Elvaston, and Ambaston, fifteen messuages, twenty-four acres of land, four acres of meadow, and a rent of twenty shillings and te.i pence; at Spondon, two messuages, forty-two acres of land, a meadow, and a rent of four shillings ; at Sandiacre, rent of five shillings ; at Smalley, rent of five shiliings ; at Mapperley, rent of three shillings and one penny ; at Locko, one messuage and ten acres of land ; at Stainsby, rent of four shillings and eleven pence ; at Duffield and Haslewood, sixty acres of land, six acres of meadow, and a rent of three shillings ; at Burley, one messuage, twenty-eight acres of land, and eight acres of meadow ; at Little Chester, one messuage, one cottage, an hundred acres of land, and four acres of meadow ; at Newland, near Derby, nine granges with a garden, nine crofts, sixteen tofts, one hundred and ninety-six acres of land, and sixteen acres of meadow ; al Chaddesden, two messuages, two cottages, an hundred and four acres of land, and six acres of meadow ; and at Key worth, in Nottinghamshire, two tofts, and three ox-gangs of land."], [411, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 383 remuneration. Ralph de Frescheville confirmed to the abbey of Darley the gift of his ancestors, Fitz-Ralph, and Robert his son, ofthe advowsons of St. Michael, in Derby, and ofthe chapel of Alvaston ; of Hubert Fitz Ralph, of the advowson of the churches of Crich and Scarcliffe, and of the chapelry of Palterton ; and of some other things which he gave for the souls of Edelina and Sarah his wives. The said Hubert Fitz Ralph, in the year 1175, confirmed to these canons the land of Pentrich, of Ripley, of Ulkerthorpe (Oakerthorpe) and that land of Chilwell which be longed to the said manor of Pentrice (Pentrich) which land his father gave, and Robert Fitz Stephen afterwards granted: divers other things this Hubert gave them, as also did this Ralph de Frescheville, who made agreement with Ralph, the abbot, the Saturday next before the feast of St. Gregory the pope, at Wynefield, in the year 1243, that the canons should have their estovers out of the wood and hay of Crich, and confirmed the gift of his mother Julian of a bovate of land in Scardecliffe. Among other benefactors to this house we find Robert Fitz Stephen, the king's chamberlain, William Peverel, lord of Nottingham, and Robert, Earl Ferrers. Walter, bishop of Coventry, confirmed the several donations, and committed to the superintendence of the abbot, the nunnery near the town of Derby. In the 4th of the reign of Edward I. Robert de Derley held of Henry de Derley and others, a messuage and garden in Derley ; and we find that in the preceding reign, Andreas de Derley held the manors of Derley, Burley and Baukevell (Bakewell.) At the suppression of the monasteries, the clear value of Darley abbey was estimated at \u00a3251. 13.. 5d. It was surrendered to the king's commissioners on the 22nd October, 1539, by the abbot and thirteen monks. Robert Sacheverell, esq. who took possession of the site as keeper of the abbey estates for the crown, purchased the materials. The church with its aisles, the Lady's chapel, St. Sythe's chapel, and the altars, candlesticks, organ, timbers, paving and gravestones with the metal in them, the roofs, &c. were valued to him at \u00a326. The site was granted to Sir William West, in 32 Henry VIII. Pilkington, in his History, is somewhat at variance with Dugdale, states that in 1540, the tombs and the whole church were sold for \u00a320. ; the cloister for \u00a310. ; and the chapter house for 20.. : and that at the same time \u00a345. Is. lOd. were received for six bells. The whole ofthe plate weighed 131 ounces. N Darley abbey is mentioned in the Herald's Visitation for 1569 as one of the seats of Sir William West. It was afterwards purchased by John Bullock, and the abbey-house was repaired. Thomas Goodbehere purchased it about the middle of the seventeenth century. In 1709, William Wolley purchased the manor, and built the hall on the bank of the Derwent. Subsequently the estate became the property of Mr. Heath, a banker, in Derby, on the sale of whose estates, the hall and surrounding land were purchased by Robert Holden, esq. who devised it to his relation, the present Robert Holden, of Nuttall Temple, county of Nottingham, esq. 1'he site of the monastic buildings is now occupied by the extensive cotton, paper and lead mills, belonging to Messrs. Evans. These manufacturies are conducted on an extensive scale, and have converted a small village into a rising town, in which improvements are almost daily perceptible. The residence of Walter Evans, esq. is an elegant brick mansion, on an elevation north ofthe village, and surrounded with plantations and tasteful pleasure grounds. The new church, recently erected here at the sole expense of Walter Evans, esq. is a handsome gothic structure, with a tower and pinnacles, built on an elevation which commands a very exten sive view over Derby to the south, as far as Charnwood forest hills, Leicestershire. The church was designed and built under the direction of Mr. Moses Wood, of Nottingham. The living is vested in Walter Evans, esq. and the present incumbent is the Rev. John Wakefield.

S. from Bakewell, on the Dereleie, road from London to Manchester, is a delightful rural villao-e, seated on the east bank of the Derwent, in a rich and fruitful valley. It is a township and con stabulary, in the hundred and deanery of High Peak. The parish is extensive, containing the township of Darley including the hamlets or villages of Farley, Hackney Lane, Over Hackney, Little Rowsley, and Toadhole, in the hundred of High Peak ; the township of Wensley and Snitterton, and the hamlets or villages of Oakerside and Oakerend in the wapentake of Wirksworth, and Bridge-town, on the Derwent, which is partly in both. The following is the enumeration, with the return of the number of inhabitants in 1801, 11, 21 and 31, with the acreage and estimated annual rental of all the buildings and land. Of the 257 families in the township of Darley, 96 were chiefly employed in agriculture, Q3 in trade or handicraft, and 68 variously : ofthe 302 males above 21 years of age, 123 are employed in agriculture, 91 in manufacture and retail trades, 30 labourers or gentlemen's servants, 17 gen tlemen or professions, and 1 4 superannuated or retired persons. The chief manufacture is flax spinning, paper making and framework-knitting, and a few young females run lace. There are two annual fairs held on the moors, at a place called Darley Flash, in this parish, on the 13th of May, and the 27th of October, for cattle and sheep. The township of Darley comprises 1600 acres of old enclosed, and 2417 a. 3 r. 2 p. of new en closed common land in Darley, and 111 acres in Little Rowsley. It is watered by the Derwent, Sydnope and Wood brooks. The land west of the Derwent is limestone, and east of the river gritstone, about one-eighth being arable, and the remainder meadow and pasture. It is bounded by Ashover E. ; Great Rowsley and Beeley N. \u25a0 Stanton, VVensley and Snitterton W. ; and Mat lock S. The waste lands were enclosed in 1766, when the estimated quantity in the parish to be enclosed was stated at 4000 acres. The principal landed proprietors are Arthur Heathcote Heathcote, of StanclifFe hall, esq. the lord ofthe manor, who owns upwards of 550 acres of land; Christopher Bower Potter, of Darley hall, esq. who owns upwards of 400 acres * Sir Francis Dar win, of Sydnope, who owns upwards of 200 acres; Peter Walthall, of Hackney Lane, esq. 180 acres; John Gisborne, esq. 48 a. 1 r. 20 p. ; Thomas Knowlton, esq. 17 acres; the Rev. Benjamin Lawrence, rector, 1 88 a. 2 r. 20 p. ; James Dakeyne, esq. upwards of 150 acres, and extensive flax mills ; Mr. John Wildgoose, 1 50 acres ; Benjamin Broomhead, esq. 58 acres ; the Duke of Rutland, 184 a. 2 r. 35 p. in Little Rowsley; Rev.

The vale through which the Derwent flows is chiefly rich meadow land, and the hills are crested with extensive plantations. The farms are from 200 acres downwards, at an average rental of 35s. an acre. The hay is exempt from tithe, the corn tithe averages from 10 to 12.S. per acre, amounting to about \u00a3450. yearly, and the small tithe to t\u00a3l00.

There are three sick clubs or friendly societies, consisting of nearly 200 members, one Lancastrian and one Sunday school, supported by voluntary subscrip tions, one Methodist Chapel, eight public houses, and three county bridges (viz. Darley, Rowsley, and Alport) in the parish. In Dereleie, kins Edward hid two carucates of land to be taxed. These five manors, Derelcie, Mestesforde, Wercheswordc, Essebume and Peurewic, with their berewicks, paid in king Edward's lime thirty-two pounds and six sextaries and a half of honey, now forty pounds of pure silver. D. B. 290\u2014292. The manor of Darley, at the Doomsday Survey, was parcel of the ancient demesnes of the crown. It was held under the crown by the families of Kendall and Darley in the reign of Ed ward I. In 1309, William Kendall died and left his moiety to his daughter and heir, the wife of Laurence Cotterill. This moiety was held under the crown, by the tender of 13s. id. yearly, towards the keeping of Peake Castle. It is probable, Lysons says, that Cotterill died without issue, and that his widow married Herberjour; for it appears, in 1392, William Roper conveyed a moiety of the manor of Darley to Nicholas Attewelle, rector of Darley, which had been the in heritance of Margaret, his mother, daughter and co-heir of Sir William le Herberjour, of Chad desden, by Alice, daughter and heir of William Kendall. The Foljambes afterwards possessed the manor. Sir Thomas Foljambe, father of Sir Godfrey, who died in 1376, resided at Darley. From the arms of Avena, wife of Sir Godfrey Foljambe, it appears she was a Darley, and probably an heiress, though Thoroton, in Kinolton, Nottinghamshire, fancies she was a Villiers ; and St. George's Visitation, in 1634, makes her an Ireland, of Hartshorn, county of Derby. The heiress of Sir Godfrey Foljambe, who died in , married Sir Robert Plumpton, of Plumpton, in York shire,, and brought a moiety of the Old hall manor in Darley to that family. The co-heiresses of William Plumpton, the grandson of the said Sir Robert, married Sotehill and Rocliff. Sotehill's moiety of the Old hall manor descended to two granddaughters, married to Sir John Constable and Sir William Drury. The latter, in 1547, was possessed of the whole ofthe moiety, and sold the same to William Needham, gent. From the Needhams it passed by sale to Senior, of Bridge Town. In 1631, the ancestor of the Duke of Rutland purchased three parts of this moiety from the Oldfields. This moiety is now vested in the Duke of Rutland and Sir John Henry Hunloke. On this moiety of the estate stood the ancient manor house of Old hall, a little to the north of Darley church, which, upon the enclosure of Darley commons, was allotted to the Duke of Rutland. In 1771, some considerable remains ofthe old mansion were taken down. The great granddaughter of Rocliff, who married one of the co-heiresses of William Plumpton, brought the other moiety to Sir Ingram Clifford, whom she married ; she having no issue by him, it became vested, pursuant to settlement, in Sir Ingram and his heirs, and was sold to Roger Columbell, of Nether hall, about 1587; it is now vested in the devisees of the late Herbert Greensmith, esq. The other moiety of Darley manor, called the manor of Nether hall, or Whitwell hall manor, on the death of Ralph de Darley, in 1 370, passed to his sister Agnes, the wife of Thomas Colum bell, of Sandiacre, esq. In consequence of this match, this place became the chief seat of the Columbell* family till the death of John Columbell, esq. in 1673. The sister and sole heiress of the latter married William Marbury, of Marbury, in Cheshire, esq. who died without issue in 1697, and bequeathed her estate in Darley to Gilbert Thacker, esq. who had married her late husband's sister. In 1701 . the estate was purchased of Mr. Thacker, by Messrs. Andrew and * A curious proviso in a Will, expressive of hatred of tobacco. Peter Columbell, of Darley, in his will, 20th Octo ber, 1616, has the following extraordinary clause : \" Now for all such household goods at Darley, whereof John Howson hath an inventory, my will is, that my son Roger shall have them all towards housekeepinge upon this con dition, If at any time hereafter any of his brothers or sisters-f shall fynd him takeing of tobacco, that then he or she so fynding him, and makeing just proffe to my executors, shall have the said goods or the full valewe thereof, according as they shall be praysed, which said goods shall presently after my death be valewed and praysed by my executors for that purpose.\" Gents. Magazine, April, 1769. t There were five brothers and three sisters, so that he must have had many eyes upon him."], [415, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 387 Robert Greensmith, of Wirksworth. In 1789, Herbert, grandson of Robert Greensmith, esq. died seised of this manor, and bequeathed it to Mr. Herbert Greensmith Beard, of Lincoln, and his brothers and sisters, by whom the whole of their landed property in Darley has been sold in parcels, but they retained the manorial rights. In 1 790, Richard Arkwright, esq. purchased the site of the old mansion, called Nether hall, with an adjoining farm. In 1796, Mr. Arkwright took down the old mansion, which by agree ment (still existing among the late Adam Wolley 's valuable collections) between John de Der legh and his mason, appears to have been erected about the year 1321 ; and built a new house at a short distance, now called Darley hall. It is now the property and residence of Christopher Bower Potter, esq. Stancliff hall, held by a younger branch of the Columbell family, under the manor of Old hall, passed by successive female heirs to the families of Newsam and Pott. It afterwards belonged to Sir John Digby, of Mansfield Woodhouse, who, in 1655, sold it to Robert Steere, of Bridgetown, gent. In 1715, Sir Paul Jenkinson gave this estate to his daughter Lettice, who, in 1718, sold the hall and estate to Robert Greensmith, esq. for \u00a31750. In 1799> the devisees of Her bert Greensmith, esq. sold the hall and estate for \u00a310,500. to William Heathcote, of Batavia, in the colony of Demarara. It is now the property, and the hall is the residence, of his brother and devisee, Arthur Heathcote Heathcote, esq. The manor of Little Rowsley belonged to the ancient family of Rollesley or Rowsley, who took their name from this place in the reign of Richard I. The heiress of this family brought the manor to Sir William Kniveton, of Mercaston, who was created a baronet in 1611. His son, Sir Gilbert, sold it to Sir John Manners, ancestor of the Duke of Rutland, who is the present pro prietor. The fine level of Darley dale, extending from Matlock village to the gates of Chatsworth, a dis tance of about six miles ; the excellent road, the richness of the soil, and the beauty of the scenery, have induced many respectable families to take up their abode in it. In Darley Dale, on the east of the Derwent, is a beautiful vale, called Sydnope, through which runs a stream of water, called Sydnope brook, on which are situate the manufactories of Messrs. Dakeyne, for spinning of flax. Seventy-five feet vertical fall on this stream, supported by four reservoirs, is applied to these works by means of three overshot water wheels, the water descending from one to the other. Messrs. Edward and James Dakeyne have invented an hydraulic machine or engine for apply ing the power or pressure of water, steam, or other fluids, to the purpose of working machinery, and other uses requiring power, and applicable to that of raising or forcing of fluids. For which his majesty's royal letters patent have recently been granted for England, and also for Scotland. And on the construction of which they have recently erected a machine to work with ninety-six feet additional fall of water on Sydnope brook, equal to thirty-five horse power, to drive the machinery of a large flax manufactory now erecting, and is occasionally put in action to drive the machinery of the old established works, instead of the water wheels. This original machine exhibits more than ordinary mechanical combination in principle and construction, whereby the power of confined fluids in continuous motion is rendered subservient to the purpose of giving rotary motion to machinery, without the necessity of the retarding in cumbrance and friction of valves or other kind of charging or discharging apparatus, and without the use of fly-wheels and other auxiliaries to regulate the motion which are well known to be heavy drawbacks on the power of first moving machines. In this machine the water descends in a continuous stream from the reservoir, confined by means of pipes, and conducted to revolve in a channel round the equatorial circumference of a globe, and the circumition gives ecliptic cir cumvolving motion by its force or pressure from the head to a circular plate fixed round the equator of the globe, extending across the channel, denominated the ecliptic ring, from its exact resemblance to the ecliptic line, delineated on a map of the terrestrial globe. And the ecliptic circumvolution gives conical motion to the poles of the globe, causing them to revolve in orbs or circles, the centre ofthe globe being the vortex. And rotary motion is given to machinery with"], [416, "388 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER regular impetus and force, continuate with the continuous stream, by means of a taper rod fixed in one, or both occasionally, of the circularly revolving poles of the globe, its termination con nected to a turnable radial arm, which revolves on an axis placed in the centre of the motion ; this revolving axis may communicate rotary motion to any kind of machinery that maybe attached by connecting wheels or coupling joints. This engine is of great utility in the application of water or steam power to the purpose of working machinery of almost every description, and can in most cases be applied to the power of descending water with more advantage than water wheels, particularly in cases of high falls, which generally require two or three water wheels, one above the other, connected with complex expen sive machinery, subject to wear and tear, or hung round with enormous segments, dragged round with lumbering motion and friction. Whereas, on the contrary, this engine is simple, and may consist of only one machine for almost any extension of fall, being in strength proportionate, and having length of pipes to the reservoir, and the speed for most kind of machinery is obtained by one pair of wheels immediately attached to the machine, which is of the greatest advantage in saving of power and also expense. By the use of this engine a small stream of water, having great descent or fall, becomes a powerful agent, equal to work corn-mills or even manufactories, where considerable power is required : in such situations the engine would be of small dimensions and not expensive. In mining operations also, this machine is of the first importance, to be fixed in deep confined excavations to drive machinery for raising water, worked by a descending column of water down the mine, to go off at soughs or levels where situations will admit of such a process. The inven tors are at this time erecting a machine for this purpose, on an extensive scale, for Thomas Bate man, of Middleton, and John Alsop, of Lea, esqrs. to be put down at their mine near Alport, in this county. The globe of this engine is six, and the outer case in which it is enclosed ten feet diameter, to work with sixty-six feet vertical fall of water, and estimated at one hundred and forty horse power. This engine is equally efficient in the various purposes of raising and forcing of fluids. Apply an actuating power of any description to its revolving axis, beforementioned, and the fluid is propelled continuate. And in most cases this machine can be used with more advantage than the common alternating pump, not only for simplicity but in having the effect of propelling the fluid in a continuous stream, and opposing uniform resistance to the actuating force applied. From low situations, where waterfalls are generally found, or from situations convenient to erect steam engines, or other description of power, by the use of this machine water may be raised with facility from deep valleys up the ascent of hills, in a continuous stream, for the use of towns, hamlets, or for the accommodation of gentlemen's seats, lands or gardens, or conveyed to descend down shafts to drain mines, by the process beforementioned. And in blast furnaces also, this machine may be used with advantage for supplying the sires with a continuous stream of air. It can be constructed in so small a compass, as to be used for culinary purposes, and also for effectu ating the action of bellows for blowing organs, either for church or house, particularly from its peculiar silence in its action. A house organ is now erecting under the direction of Mr. John Dakeyne, of Darley, the bellows whereof is intended to be put into action by the said patent machine. The machine, denominated the Equalinum, now in general use in the process of spinning of flax, was also invented in Darley Dale, by the beforementioned Edward and James Dakeyne, in their minority, for which, in 1794, or the following year, a patent was granted to their father, \" Daniel Dakeyne, sen. of Darley Dale, in co. Derby, esq. for a machine for the purpose of pre paring and spinning of flax, denominated the Equalinum.\" This original and much admired machine, the sole and effective principle of rendering the fibre of flax clear and even in the pro cess of preparing flax for spinning, is now become prevalent in most of the flax manufacturing districts throughout the kingdom, and vulgarly called the Gill machinery. The manufactories in Darley Dale were commenced about the year 1780, by the beforemen tioned Daniel Dakeyne, esq. of this parish, descended of an ancient family in this county."], [417, "389 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. No lead mines have been wrought in this parish on the east of the Derwent, with the exception of one lately discovered near Matlock, called Moat Hall. The stratum on this side being the great limestone shale, recumbent on the limestone, which, rising from beneath, becomes the up permost -tratum in the adjacent mineral field, on the south-west of the Derwent. This great limestone shale or schistus has been proved not to be rich in mineral productions or curiosities \u2022 but a large petrified sea fish, in a solid stone, was lately found by Messrs. Edward and James Dakeyne, on their sinking a shaft in pursuit of a mine near their works ; it was found in the vein forty yards below the level of Sydnope brook, and is in length about twenty inches and ten in breadth, much flattened, and adhering to both faces of the stone when divided, and appeared of its natural colour, but partially very brilliant and beautifully variegated with pyrites, as if gilt with gold leaf, which faded on long exposure to the air. There can be no doubt but Sydnope had its name from a hill called the Knabb, by the south side of which the brook runs. There is a small village a little below the works of Messrs. Dakeyne, called Toad-hole ; this appellation was supposed by Mr. Blore and Mr. Wolley to be a vulgar deviation from the old hall, the ancient residence of the family of Columbell and Darley, in the centre of the village ; the moat round which is plain to be seen, at the present time, in a field opposite the residence of Messrs. Dakeyne. Dr. Aikin gives the following description of Darley : \" Darley church,\" says he, \" lies on the east side of the Derwent, close to it in the dale leading from Matlock to Bakewell, which is one ofthe most beautiful rides in the kingdom. The church is ancient, and in the church-yard is one of the oldest and largest yew trees in the kingdom. No traveller can pass without noticing its appearance, which gives solemnity to the lonely church-yard : there is no building but the par sonage near it, which probably is as ancient as the church; adjoining it are pleasant grounds and gardens, much improved and beautified by the present incumbent, the Rev. Mr. Wray, who has had the pleasure of seeing trees planted with his own hands towering as high as the steeple of the church, and shading a considerable space of ground. He remembers in his early youth, the branches of the yew tree extending to a length, and covering a space of ground, that would appear almost incredible. Some of its noble branches have been broken off of late years.\" A modern author thus describes Darley : \" Darley dale, like that of Hope, is in beautiful con trast to many of those wilder ones in Derbyshire, that mark the course of its mountain rivers. The village church, reposing on the sylvan banks of the Derwent, shaded by a venerable yew, appears as the sacred guardian of the scene, holding out the blessed promise, that to those who fear God and keep his commandments, brighter waters and never fading verdure shall be theirs.\" The improvements that have recently taken place is the straightening the line of road from Matlock to Bakewell, and the erection of a capital inn on the new line by A. H. Heathcote, esq. called the Grouse Inn. The church-yard is ornamented with one of the largest and most ancient yew trees in the king dom. It measures 33 feet in girth, and though robbed of many of its branches, still exhibits a singular specimen of luxuriant vegetation. The church is an ancient gothic structure with a square embattled and pinnacled tower, dedi cated to St. Helen. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \u00a357- Us. 10^d. and yearly tenths 19_. 3|<_. This valuable living, now producing with the glebe of 188 acres, tithes and surplice fees, nearly \u00a3900. a year, is in the gift of the Dean of Lincoln, and the Rev. Ben jamin Lawrence, of Gloucester Place, New Road, London, is the present rector, and the Rev. S. Saxton, is his curate. Against a window in the south transept of the church is a recumbent figure of a crusader, with his legs crossed, curled hair and beard, a sword by his side, holding in his hands a heart, and a rose at his feet carved in stone. Tradition says his name was John, of Darley, and that he lived at a place in the neighbourhood, called Darley hall. Beneath this is an alabaster slab with an inscription in Old English, now defaced. The stone font is very ancient, inscribed with letters and coats of arms."], [418, "390 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER A stone coffin was found many years ago, of ancient date, which probably contained the remains of some distinguished individual in the neighbourhood.

In natural and acquired endowments had few su periors, in their application none, for every faculty of his soul was uniformly subservient to the interests of re ligion and virtue, which appeared strongly in his zeal for the true welfare of his parishioners ; on the ninth day of August, 1808, he terminated his exemplary life, in the eighty-seventh year of his age, retaining in an unusual degree, nearly to the last, the vivacity and energy of youth, a blessing for which he was less indebted to a vigorous constitution than early temperance and a well regulated mind ; his family will long lament the loss of an indulgent husband and parent. Next to this, on a pillar, is a black marble monument, to Thomas Savage, twenty-six years rector of this parish, who died April 26, 1704, aged 49 years.

A knightly"], [423, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 395 family of Dakeny were settled in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, in the time of Henry III. and Edward I. About the same period Baldwin de Akeney was Lord of Holkham, in the latter county. Several generations of Dakeny, from Edward I. to 1390, were Lords of a sixth part of the barony of Kainho, in the county of Bedford. Several generations of Dakin are recorded in Chauncey's Hertfordshire. Many respectable families of the name of Dakins were seated at Brandesburton, Cottingham, Linton, Hackness, and other places, county of York. Arthur Da kins, of Linton and Hackness, esq. M. P. for Scarborough, 7 Edward VI. was second son of Robert Dakins, of Chelmorton, county of Derby, 3 Henry VIII. who was son of Thomas Dakyn, of the same place. ThisArthur, in 1563, had a confirmation of Arms, with the Motto \u2014 \"Stryke, Dakyns, the devil's in the hempe:\" he died in 1592, and was buried at Hackness, where are his monument and arms.

The Dakeynes of Stubbing Edge were of the same blood as the above Arthur Dakeyne, of Hackness, and adopted the same Arms, with the difference of Griffins instead of Lions in the staunches. The late Mr. Daniel Dakeyne, of Holt House, was a poet and an eminent antiquary. He was a contemporary with Blore, and collected considerable materials for the compilation of a Topo graphical and Genealogical History of his native county, which are contained in seven folio man uscript volumes, now in the possession of his widow, to whom we acknowledge ourselves in debted for some of the pedigrees contained in these volumes. Messrs. Edward and James Da keyne, his younger brothers, are eminent mechanics, and have obtained patents for their inven tions and improvements of flax and spinning machinery and steam engines.

DENBY is a scattered village 7 m. N. of Derby, and 3 m. S. of Ripley, on the right of the Denebi, Derby and Alfreton turnpike road. It is a township, a constabulary, and a parochial chapelry, in the parish of Horsley, in the deanery of Castillar, and hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. In 1831, it contained 240 houses, 24-3 families, and 1272 inhabitants. Ofthe fami lies, 50 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 30 in trade and handicraft, and the 163 not in cluded in the two preceding classes are chiefly employed in working the extensive collieries and ironstone pits which abound in the parish. Ofthe 300 males above 21 years of age, 92 are em ployed in agriculture, 51 as framework-knitters or retail traders, 150 as labourers in the collieries, &c. and 7 variously. This village seems to have been of some importance early in the fourteenth century. In 8 Ed ward III. Richard, Lord Grey, of Codnor, obtained a charter for a market, and also a fair on the eve and nativity of the Blessed Virgin. At one period four respectable families resided here, viz. two of the name of Lowe, Roby, and Smith. This place also gave birth to the celebrated astronomer royal, the Rev. John Flamsteed, who was born at Denby old hall. The Denby Colliery Company have the minerals for two miles east by west, and three quarters of a mile in breadth. Mrs. Lowe has also valuable coal mines on her estate here and elsewhere in the great coal field. The soft coals procured from the pits here are considered superior to most others in the county for smiths' use, and there is a great demand for them. The Denby hard coal is much consumed in the borough of Derby, and large quantities are sent by canal into the counties of Nottingham, Lincoln, Leicester and Northampton. The township, containing about 2200 acres of coal and ironstone land, the surface of which is stiff clay, is watered by Bottle brook, and bounded by Ripley and Codnor N. ; Loscoe and Heanor E. ; Horsley Woodhouse S. ; Kilbourn and Heage W. ; and Smalley S.

The great tithes be long to Sir Robert Wilmot, of Chaddesden, bart. as trustee for the Widows' Almshouses at Derby, who receives about 2s. 6d. an acre composition, and the small tithes belong to the Rev. Joseph Miller, incumbent of Horsley and Denby. The principal proprietors are Mrs. Lowe, of Locko hall, the lady of the manor, who owns about 1400 acres; John Wright, esq. 120 acres; Mrs. Strelley, 310 acres; John Barber, esq. ; John Moore, 48 acres : George Eley, 32 acres ; John, Benjamin and Joseph Barber, 85 acres ; Edward Smith, 8 acres ; George Wilson, of Alfreton ; and Marriott.

By the Test, de Neville we are informed that in the time of king John, his favourite, William Briwere, held lands in Denby, for which he paid by the hands of Hugo de Makeny, 24.. 8d. The chief part of the manor remained in the possession of the family of de Rossel, until the reign of Henry VI. when, as the property of the heiress, it became vested in Lawrence Lowe, sergeant at law, the ancestor of the family of Lowe, of Locko. The Rossels had a park at Denby in the reign of Henry III. In the reign of Edward II. Richard de Grey, of Codnor, held a part of the manor in right of a gift from William Rossel and William Bernack, who are styled kinsmen and co-heirs of John de Denby. In the 8th of the succeeding reign Richard de Grey obtained a charter for a market at Denby on Thursdays, and a fair for two clays at the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. He left to his son, John de Grey, an estate at Denby, which was called the manor of Park hall. The family of de Frescheville held the hall and lands under the de Greys, of Codnor, from the 14th of Richard II. until the reign of Henry VI. and on the 21st year of the last mentioned reign, Richard de Grey, of Codnor, died and left it to his son Henry. John Lowe, esq. the son of John, was living in 1712, and had a very good house at Denby.

The family of Lowe are of long standing in the county of Derby ; they became possessed of a considerable estate here as early as Henry VI. which has continued in the family to the present time. DERBY, the capital ofthe county, is a corporate and borough town, sending two representa- Deoraby, tives to parliament, and consisting of five parishes with their dependent chapelries ' and townships, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. It is situate upon the banks ofthe Derwent, upon ground of different heights, and is surrounded with gentle and plea sant eminences, from which flow the Markeaton and other brooks. It is in longitude 1\u00b0 25' W. latitude 52\u00b0 58' N. ; 126 m. N. N. W. from London ; 1 78 m. from Brighton ; 28 m. from Leices ter ; 17 m. from Loughborough : 16 m.

E. from Liverpool ; 109 m- from Lancaster ; 73 m. from Chester ; 62 m. from Manches ter; 38 m. from Buxton ; 27 m. from Bakewell; 17 m. from Matlock Bath ; 16 m. from Crom ford; 13 m. from Wirksworth ; 8 m. from Belper: 128 m. N. E. from Bath and Bristol; 40 m. from Birmingham; 23 m. from Lichfield; 11m. from Burton; 42 m. from Coventry; 14 m. from Ashby-de-la-Zouch : 19 m. from Uttoxeter, and 13 m. from Ashbourn. The town of Derby is situate on the western bank ofthe Derwent, about forty-five miles from the source of that river, and nearly ten from its junction with the Trent. As the river approaches the town from Darley it is less confined by the great ridge of limestone and granite hills that em bank its eastern side until it has passed the village of Duffield. The valley then opening to a considerable extent in that direction, the waters expand and frequently overflow the more level ground, and consequently the stream rolls on, with a wider and less rapid course. Opposite to the town of Derby, it embraces several insulated knowls or holmes, and the land stretches in meadows and marshes. The western bank, on which the town is built, rises with a bold but not abrupt sweep, in several undulated heights from the water's edge. These heights are indented by a valley through which flows a strong brook from Markeaton. This brook is known by va rious names : it was anciently called the Odde-brook. The part of it without the town, and until it becomes united with a small stream named Foulbrook drainage from Littleover, is called the Markeaton brook, and the remainder, to its junction with the Derwent, is denominated the Mor ledge creek or Gaol brook. If we, in imagination, divest the whole of the site of Derby of the houses, manufactories, churches and other buildings with which it is covered, we shall be struck with the beauty and convenience, which undoubtedly tempted its earliest founders to select it as a place of residence. Records of its state during the time of the Britons are not to be expected, but we may easily sup pose that its central situation, its hills and valleys of fertile marl, and the groves of oaks which, on such a soil, must have grown very luxuriantly, would tempt the Druids and their dependants to make it one of their principal abodes, as a priesthood, not less observant of the eligibility of their locations, did at a subsequent era. There is reason to believe that the northern slope, de scending below St. Alkmund's church to the water's edge, where the remains of St. Mary's church and monastery are still visible, is the most ancient part of the town. The Roman station of Little"], [428, "400 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Chester occupied the pasture lands, at a very short distance up the river, on its eastern bank. A bridge, of which, it is said, some vestiges are still discernible in the bed of the stream, afforded an easy communication with the inhabitants, composed undoubtedly of natives intermixed with Roman colonists and traders. The Derwent, also, was fordable in former times, at the spot where St. Mary's bridge now stands, previously to the construction of the artificial wears below it. The bank that stretches itself southwards from St. Mary's chapel, in slopes of unequal declivity to the Morledge creek was, according to tradition and records, for several centuries an open space, con taining fullers' and dyers' ground, with separate dwellings that stood without any regular order upon the declivity. It is impossible to trace the sites of the habitations contained within the limits of the town, but we are able to assert, that in the days of the Saxons and early Normans, the western elevations, which must have been pleasant and inviting, with the Odde-brook flow ing through coppices intermingled with willows and alders, and its gentle eminences on the north and the south covered with oaks and beech, were occupied by clusters of regular ecclesiastics. From Darley, through St. Helen's, Nun's-green, Friar-gate, to St. James's, these monastics swarm ed like bees on a bank of thyme, and in that direction there was scarcely an inch of land unap propriated by monasteries with their pleasure grounds, gardens and orchards. Were we to venture, with materials sufficient scarcely to supply suggestions, to sketch an im aginary outline of Derby, in those ancient times of which we have been speaking, we should first place groups of habitations in the part of St. Alkmund's parish which lies nearest the river, and these we should connect by some isolated dwellings with that part of the parish of St. Werburgh which, lying on the Odde-brook, would be likely to attract the millers and the bleachers by the conveniences which that stream must have afforded them. St. Alkmund and St. Werburgh are both Saxon saints, of whom mention has been made in our General History. On the most ele vated spot between the Derwent and the Odde-brook, we would fix the site of the old church of All-hallows or All Saints, with the residences of its secular priesthood, in an open space of ground. The Iron-gate* and Sadler-gate with their artizans in iron, armory, harness and various imple ments serviceable in battle or field labour, should gradually appear with workshops and houses scattered down the side of the hill and along the bank of the Odde-brook. Behind these, we would endeavour to trace a highway from the hamlet of Werburgh, just where the brook dividing its course flows in two or three streams, and intersects the land into holmes or islands. This road would pass a little to the north of All Saint's church, and taking the top of the hill to the north-east, would enter Bridge-gate and terminate at St. Mary's church and monastery. Of this supposed road, the first part alone, near the Odde-brook remains, and is still called St. Mary's gate.t puzzling topographers to account for its existence with such a name, in a part of the town so remote from the edifice that seems to have given it its appellation. Having ventured thus to trace St. Mary's-gate from the brook to the ford or bridge over the Derwent, we may boldly assert that it was the main road through the town at the time of the Saxons, and that, crossing the Odde-brook at St. Werburgh's, it was carried on between the possessions of the monks of St. James and the Dominicans of Friar-gate, and so on over the hill at Littleover until it arrived at the ferry opposite Repton or Repandun,J then the capital of Mercia, and the residence of her monarchs. On the fall of the Mercian kingdom the intercourse with Repton would necessarily \u2022 Gate formerly signified road or footpath, and in the Cambridge Latin Dictionary, we find gate or way, rendered by semita and via. + It may indeed be objected, that if ever a road to the east of St. Alkmund's church, leading to St. Mary's bridge had existed, it would not have been destroyed and built over. The communication which has constantly been carried on between this town and Nottingham, particularly when the two adjoining counties were under the same Lord Lieutenant, and the assizes were held alternately in the county town of each, would certainly have rendered the pre servation of such a road desirable. It must however be recollected that all the old gates or roads in this and other ancient towns are narrow and crooked ; besides St. Alkmund's church-yard has been enlarged eastward, by taking in part of an old passage that entered Bridge-gate opposite to Darley lane. King-street and the western side of Queen street have been built upon what was formerly monastic property, and the broader road through these streets, al though it diverges somewhat to the west, may have been preferred to the old narrow gate. X Repandun is a contraction for Repandunum, but the former name is used by various old monkish writers as the nominative or appellative case, although in the other cases it takes the regular form of the second declension."], [429, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 401 cease, and a road to Leicester, where kings of a later date have held their court and summoned their parliament, would consequently be opened, and speedily become the great road to London. The site of the market-place appears not to have been changed : it must have been convenient to the dyers, bleachers, woolstaplers and millers, in whose hands lay the chief business of the town. The holy rood or wooden cross may be presumed to have stood where Rooden or Rotten row has been subsequently erected. St. James's monastery with its offices occupied a large part of the western side of the present corn-market. To the south of the Odde-brook or Markeaton brook, the land rises more gradually, but attains a superior elevation. Green-lane and Abbot's-hill with the adjoining declivities constituted a ridge of land of considerable height, commanding a prospect of wide extent and overlooking the whole of the town. On a projecting part of this eminence stood the castle, with walls and towers extending down to the bank of the river. Of this fortress, of which there remain only nominal vestiges, we may venture to assert that it was of great antiquity, and that it was occupied and probably rebuilt by the Danes during the early part ofthe tenth century. This castle may again have gone to decay, and have been repaired by Peverel, the natural son of William the Con queror, by whom that venerable antiquarian, Hutton, supposes it to have been built; but there are reasons to believe that the Danes were masters chiefly of this southern portion of the town, and we are informed by writers of authenticity that they never neglected to raise fortifications or to improve those which they found in the places where they settled for any time. Besides the road from this elevated part of the town to Repton or Repandun, which was long in the hands of the Danes, crosses a high land which commands a view of that ancient capital of Mercia, and on that ridge the hamlet of Normanton still exists and proves that these North-men or Norsemen, as they were called by the Saxons, had there fixed an important station. The walls of the castle extended to the river's edge, and one of the principal fortresses stood upon the eminence now called Cock-pit-hill. We may conclude that the part of Derby south of Markeaton brook was, for some centuries, but thinly inhabited. Having taken this imaginary survey ofthe situation of the town, and of the gradual occupa tion by the Britons, Saxons and Normans until about a century or two after the Conquest, we will proceed to such matters of record as have descended to the present period. There have been various conjectures concerning the name of the town ; but the most probable is its derivation from the British appellation of the river on which it is situate. Derwent is the name applied to swift streams in different parts of England. The Roman station called Castrum Parvum or Little Chester, took the name of Derventio from its proximity to the British town. In the chronicle of the princely Ethelward, the learned son of Alfred, we are told that the Saxon name of this town was Nortliworthige, and that the Danes called it Dcoraby. We may suppose that the casual ap pellation of Northivorthige, or the northern market, had reference to its position with respect to Repton or Repandun, the capital of Mercia, situate at about the distance of eight miles on the southern bank of the Trent. That it was known to the Saxons as well as the Danes by the ap pellation of Deoraby, appears from the general Saxon Chronicles, where it is mentioned by no other name, and from coins struck in this town, during the reigns of Athelstan and Edgar. The word Deoraby is a corruption of the old British name, or perhaps an adaptation of it to the Saxon idiom ; the syllable aby being the origin of our word abode. From Deoraby the modern appel lation Derby is easily deduced. Some persons have imagined that the name is compounded of Deer, a wild or swift animal, and by or aby, an abode; and they point to the arms ofthe town as authority for their supposition. Mr. Pilkington thinks this conjecture is rendered probable by two circumstances. \" One is,\" says that ingenious topographer, \" that the arms ofthe town are, a buck couchant in a park ; and the other, that one of the lanes adjoining the town is still called Lodge lane.\" To this it has been replied that the arms are derived from the name, for the name was used long before the introduction of armorial bearings into England. They are allusive or h'Toglyphic arms, the buck expressing the syllable Deer or Der, and the park, the syllable by or abode. As to Lodge-lane, it was probably the approach to a monastic lodge belonging to St. Helen's. There are others (as the Rev. Robert Simpson remarks) among whom are Bishop 3 F"], [430, "402 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Gibson, who have supposed that the name Derby is derived from B i, by, and Dur, water ; but this differs little from the derivation already given. The first historical mention of the place is found in the writings of the venerable Bede, who relates that Edwin, after he had been restored by the aid of Rodowald, king ofthe East Angles, to the kingdom of Northumberland, met at this place,* which was a royal town, the bishop Pau linus, who had accompanied his second wife, the princess Ethelburga of Kent, from her father's court. In the presence of this holy man, a ruffian in the pay of Quicelm, king of the West Saxons, assailed Edwin with an envenomed weapon, and would have assassinated him, had not a thane, named Lilla, thrown himself before the king, received the blow through his body, and fallen dead at the feet of the prince, to the safety of whom he had devoted his life. Edwin him self was slightly wounded, and vowed by his Saxon gods, that he would be avenged on the treacherous enemy. Paulinus told him that vengeance was in the hands of the Christian God alone, and promised him victory if he would become a christian. The king promised to do so, and his pious queen being that same night delivered of a daughter, Edwin, at the persuasion of the bishop, united with the entreaties of his royal consort, consented that his infant daughter should receive the rites of baptism with twelve of the most distinguished of his attendants. He shortly afterwards obtained a complete victory over the West Saxons. Edwin, who combined great political prudence with his valour, hesitated to embrace publicly the christian faith, not withstanding the earnest prayers of the queen, but endeavoured first to secure the approbation of the Grand Council, and to overcome the prejudices of his Saxon subjects, by inducing Coifi, the high priest, in whose appeals to their divinities both the populace and the army had been accus tomed to confii'.e, to profess himself a convert to Christianity. Llaving accomplished these two important points, he was baptized, together with his niece Hilda, on Easter-day, 627- A period ensues of more than two hundred and forty years without the mention of any histor ical circumstance relative to the town of Derby. In 874, the Danish chieftain, Halfdene, estab lished his head quarters in this town, and nominated the abject Saxon prince, Ceonwulf, to the throne of Mercia, which he held as tributary to the Danes until 877- He was then dispossessed and slain by his ferocious masters, who placed Danish garrisons in five ofthe principal towns of Mercia \u2014 Derby, Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln and Stamford. Having despoiled Repandun, where were situate the residence and the burial place of the Mercian monarchs, the Danish chief made Derby his capital, and by the sufferance of the great Alfred, who, having caused his para mount authority to be acknowledged, was desirous that his subjects, whether Saxons or Danes, should live in peace. This part of Mercia had suffered greatly during the Danish wars, and therefore after the submission of the Danes, Alfred settled a colony of these subdued and newly baptized marauders in Derby. The whole of Mercia he bestowed upon -Ethelred, with the title of Subregalus, or Duke of Mercia; but this prince, who had espoused \u00c6thelfleda, the daughter of Alfred, never carried his power into those parts of the province possessed by the Danes : it was left for his heroic widow to rescue Derby and the rest of Mercia from Danish tyranny. In 912 the government of Mercia was administered by \u00c6thelfleda with wisdom and heroic courage. Her brother, Edward the Elder, was then on the throne of England ; and was engaged in warfare with the turbulent Danes. As the particulars of these wars are narrated in our Gen eral History ofthe County, it will be sufficient to repeat, that in 9 18, this heroic princess surpri sed the Danish commander in Derby and gained possession ofthe town. In this conflict, which, if we may judge from the bodies, bones and arms discovered in cutting down the hill on the western side of the Osmaston road, was fought on that spot, four of her most esteemed leaders were slain. The Rev. Robert Simpson is of opinion that, upon this occasion, the castle was de molished. The princess \u00c6thelfleda died shortly after this event, leaving an only daughter, who, on ac count of her supposed attachment to a youthful Danish prince, named Reginald, was deprived of * It may be doubted, however, whether this incident did not happen at Derventio, now called Auldby, about six miles from York, and the usual residence of Edwin and other Northumbrian sovereigns."], [431, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 403 her hereditary possessions by the king, her uncle, and sent to a nunnery. In the ensuing reign the Danes again made themselves masters of Derby, from whence, in 942, they were finally driven by Edmund, the brother of Athelstan. Notwithstanding the troubles of this period, Derby was a place of importance. A coin ofthe reign of Athelstan, has on the reverse this legend, \"Hegemedes mo on Deoraby;\" and the name Deoraby also occurs on a coin of the reign of Edgar. These are proofs that money was coined here at that period During the succession ofthe Dukes of Mercia, we have no mention of Derby, but we find from the Doomsday Book two important circumstances relative to its condition, before and after the Norman conquest. \" In the time of king Edward (the Confessor) there were in the borough of Derby, two hun dred and forty-three resident burgesses, and adjoining the borough there were twelve carucates of taxed land: eight suitable for ploughing. This land was divided among forty-one burgesses, who had twelve carucates besides. Two thirds of the taxes, tolls, forfeitures and of all custom rates belonged to the King, and one third to the Earl. In the same borough there was in the de mesne ofthe king, one church with seven clerks, who held two carucates in Cestre (Little Ches ter) free. There was also another church belonging in like manner to the king, in which six clerks held nine bovates of land in Cernun and Detton; also free. In the town itself there were fourteen mills.\" This description exhibits a very favourable idea of the condition of the place. Two hundred and forty-three burgesses with their families and attendants must have constituted a population of above a thousand persons, and the existence of fourteen mills shows that there was much activity and even capital in the place. This was previous to the conquest in 1066. Our General History points out the causes which in less than fifty years* depopulated the town of half its principal in habitants, laid waste their habitations, and transferred the fixed property from its legitimate own ers into the possession of some of the ferocious soldiers of the invader. Observe the contrast as it stands in the same ancient document. \" There are now there,\" says the Doomsday Survey, \" one hundred burgesses, and forty others of minor (or reduced) condition. There are one hundred and three desolated dwellings which formerly paid rates.\" \u2014 It is remarkable that these burgesses, reduced persons and desolate dwell- ings, make up together two hundred and forty-three, the number of householders or burgesses in the reign of Edward the Confessor. We conclude from this that every householder, in the Saxon times, was esteemed a burgess ; and probably the forty minores were actually minors, who had lost their fathers in the recent wars. \u2014 \"There are now,\" continues the Survey, \" ten mills and sixteen acres of meadow. The coppice wood is three quarentens in length and two in breadth. In the time of king Edward, it paid in all twenty-four pounds; now, with the mills and the town of Ludecerce (Litchurch) it pays thirty pounds.\" Thus it seems that the rates were raised, although the means of paying them were diminished. It is probable that by Ludecerce is meant the whole of St. Peter's, or the town on the south side of Markeaton brook. But to proceed \u2014 \"And nine villanes have two carucates and twelve acres of meadow. In Derbii the abbot of Bertone hath one mill and one masure (equal to four bovates) of land, with soc and sac, besides two masures of which the king has the soc, and twelve acres. Goisfrid Alselin has one church which belonged to Tochi. Radulf, the son of Hubert, has one church which belonged to Leuric, with one carucate of meadow. Norman of Lincoln has one church which belonged to Brun. Edric has one church there, which belonged to Coin his father. Count Hugh has two masures and one fishery with soc and sac. Henry de Ferrariis, three masures, with soc and sac, in like manner. Osmer, the priest, has one bovate of land with soc and sac. Godwin, the priest, has one bovate of land with the like. At the feast of St. Martin, the burgesses pay to the king twelve thraves of corn, of which the abbot of Bertrne has forty sheaves. There are, moreover, in the said borough, eight masures with soc and sac. These were \u00c6lgar's, they now are the king's. * The Doomsday Book was begun in 10111, and completed in about six years."], [432, "404 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The King's two-thirds of levied money, and the Earl's third,* came out of the Apletreu wapen take in Dereberie (Derbyshire) are together in one rate in the hands of the vice Earl (or high sheriff) according to the testimony of the two shires. They say, with respect to Stori, the pre decessor of Walter de Aincurt, that without the permission of any one, he might build himself a church on his own land, and in his own soc, and send his tithe wherever he would.\" The sufferings of a town delivered over to the exactions of the Norman soldiers of fortune, must have been very great. The revenue of the inhabitants in the time of Edward the Confessor was undoubtedly considerable, for if we take the value of money to be forty-five times the present value, the \u00a324. then levied will amount to \u00a3l080.t The number of houses in ruins and of the mills that had fallen into disuse, with the expulsion of Saxon proprietors of churches and lands in favour of the invaders, are recorded testimonials of the magnitude of the calamity with which Derby was then visited. When William the Conqueror enriched his natural son, William de Peverel, with numerous manors in this and the neighbouring counties, he retained Derby as a royal demesne, nor is there any just ground for asserting, as we find in Lysons, Simpson and other writers, that the fee-farm of Derby was granted by Henry II. while he was yet Earl of Normandy, to the Earl of Chester, among the other extensive grants bestowed by the young prince on that powerful nobleman on account of his services against king Stephen, in favour of the claims advanced by the empress Maud. The Derby mentioned in the grant is expressly stated by Dugdale to be West Derby, in Lancashire. No incident connected with this borough occurs until the reign of John, when the crown claimed its usual dues, and allowed the third penny to the Earl, who was then William de Ferrers. In the year 1 1 99, which was the first of that sovereign's reign, Ysolt, widow of Philip de Dereby, is stated to have paid twenty marks to the king for an acquittance of all debts due to the crown, for the wardship of her own children, and for administering to the effects of her de ceased husband. And in Rymer's F\u00e6dera, there appears a deed, dated at Northampton, June 7th, in the first year of John, granting to William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, the third penny on all pleas determined in the sheriff's court in the whole county of Derby, and as well within as without the borough. About this time, the burgesses of Derby began to be desirous of being allowed to take the government of the town into their own hands. Hitherto, the chief magistrate, who was called prepositus or provost, had been, appointed by the Earl, and all fines and imposts were levied by him. In 1202, the burgesses paid into the king's exchequer a fine of sixty-six marks for a con firmation ofthe free customs that had been enjoyed by them in the time of Henry I. and Henry II. and for the privilege of collecting by an officer chosen by themselves, the fee-farm rent and other dues payable to the King and Earl. It is very probable that the provost had frequently laid the assessments in a partial manner. Two years afterwards they obtained a charter similar to that granted to the town of Nottingham, but for this testimony of royal favour they were re turned debtors to the exchequer in sixty marks and two palfreys, and the fee-farm rent was rais ed from \u00a330. to \u00a340. This charter confirms the rights of Thol, Theam, Infongethef and Theolonia ; appoints the weekly markets ; grants a monopoly of dying cloth to the borough ; provides that if any serf or villane whencesoever he might come in the time of peace, should continue to reside in the bo rough for a year and a day, unclaimed of his liege lord, no one should afterwards have lawful claim of him, except the king himself. The undisturbed possession of land for a year and a day after purchase, was to be a legal title against all claimants provided such claimants were in Eng land during that period. Residents in the borough, belonging to other demesnes, to contribute to the rates. Traders coming to the market to be free from all arrest except for the king's dues. * This is the same as the tertium denarium or third penny, frequently mentioned as the due of the ancient Earls, and appears to have been fixed in the times of the Saxons. \u25a0\"- We have no correct means of estimating the value of property in Derby at that period. Two centuries afterwards, three water-mills upon the Markeaton brook were let for six marks per annum ; and land varied from bd. to 2__. rent according to its quality."], [433, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 405 The burgesses to have a merchant-guild with all privileges and free customs, incident and apper taining thereto : freedom from toll throughout the kingdom : power to appoint a bailiff or bo rough-reeve, who should be answerable for the king's due ; and should such borough-reeve be displeasing to the crown, the burgesses were to appoint another: the borough-reeve to pay the dues of the crown at two terms, namely, one half at the close of Easter, the other at the octave of Michaelmas. Any one violating this charter to be fined \u00a310. During the ensuing reign of Henry III. in the year 1256, the burgesses obtained the additional right of issuing writs for the recovery of debts, with the power to choose a coroner. For these immunities they paid seventy marks, and in the year following they paid ten more, for the liberty of expelling Jews from the borough. We have shown in our General History that Jews, as brokers and money lenders, took advantage of the troubles during those unsettled times when Henry III. and the barons were carrying on a desolating contest. Large possessions were mort gaged to them at an exorbitant rate of interest, which the owners of manors could not discharge without increasing their demands upon their tenantry. At a period of internal commotions, when every class of society suffered with severity, these dealers in money appeared alone to thrive ; and believing themselves to have become necessary to both parties, and having made it the in terest of some of the most powerful of the barons and princes to protect them, they forgot the fatal consequences of displaying their wealth, and began to live ostentatiously. The supersti tious hatred, which in that age, was easily excited against that unhappy race, seemed to sanction all that envy, avarice and ignorance dictated. The Jews were expelled from every town in the kingdom : in some they were massacred, and in others they were executed under extravagant ac cusations wliich the barbarity of the courts legalized. On those who escaped this heavy perse cution, a tax was laid in the third year of the reign of Edward I. Joseph de Chauncey, a monk, and Pain de Chaworth were appointed to assess the amount to be levied, and William de Derby was joined in commission with Nicholas Kyngeston to collect it. These collectors were paid out ofthe exchequer the sum of four pounds, nineteen shillings, for their services performed between Michaelmas and the Sunday next after the following Ascension-day. Notwithstanding the losses that must have been sustained by the borough and the surrounding country when Robert de Ferrers, the last Earl of Derby belonging to that family, by his ill-timed rebellion, brought down the vengeance of prince Edmund, and of his brother Edward (after- wards Edward I.) upon the whole neighbourhood, it may be affirmed, that Derby had increased both in population and wealth, towards the close of the thirteenth century. A rate for paving, granted in 1290, may be considered a proof of the improving state ofthe town, and there exists a memorial, drawn up in the 4th of Edward I. probably by a Commission of Enquiry, which, al- though it is full of complaints, seems to contain the rude outline of an improvement act. After stating that the manorial rights of the borough, formerly vested in the crown, had been in the burgesses since the time that king John had granted them their charter, the commissioner com- plains that the traders from Meleburn had for three years refused to pay toll at Swarkeston bridge, and that Robert de Esseburn had appropriated to his own use the tolls of a bridge called Donne- brugge. \u2014 As others from the king, had claimed the right of the return of writs, the burgesses state that they have held that right for forty years by the grant of Henry III. ; that they have the right of gallows from the grants of the two last sovereigns ; that they have the right of the assize of bread and beer through the liberties of the borough by ancient custom. The burgesses also complain that the bailiffs of the abbey of Leicester distrain the traders of the borough on passing the boundary of the counties near Meleburn, in their way to the fair at Bredon, under pretence of a debt, which they never incurred or were sureties for ; which distraint is contrary to the charter of Henry III. They also complain that the bailiffs of Thomas Touchet in the same manner distrain upon those who trade to the fair at Esseburn. The remainder of the memorial relates to certain encroachments upon the highway through the borough. Some one, not named, had built a hog-sty* twelve feet by six, upon the high road, now seven years past. Jordan, the \" The original word is porchiam, which Mr. Simpson translates porch. He may be right, but we consider the word to be a contraction of porcarium, and we think that hog-sties were more common than porches in those days."], [434, "406 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER fuller, had made a sewer across the road, to the great annoyance of passengers, now five years passed. Radulph, the son of Radulph, had raised a wall near the road thirty feet by two. Thomas Rennaway had built a gable upon the high road, to the great injury of passengers. Hugh de Morleye had built a house too near the high road, one hundred feet in length and two feet in width.* The abbot of Derleye had made a ditch sixty feet by two, encroaching upon the highway. William Juvenis has extended the gable end of his upper rooms over the higli road, to the great inconvenience of passengers, now thirty years passed. Thomas de Tomeworthe had also built the gable end of his upper room in the same manner. Geoffry Nicholas, the harness maker, had built a house too near the road, twenty feet in length and one foot in width. The abbot of Derleye had for eight years passed, made a marl-pit upon the high road, to the great in jury of passengers. The bishop of Chester and the abbot of Dale had injured the stream of the Derwent by their dams or wears. From this memorial we glean but few facts concerning the actual state of the town. The anxiety to clear the high road from obstructions is a proof of the increasing traffic of the inhabi tants, but when we find a marl-pit and a sewer open upon that road for many years, we must confess that the general intercourse could not have been very great. If we enquire the value of property at that time, there are documents extant to inform us, that the Grange-house in Derby, belonging to the abbot of Derley, with a paddock, garden and court-yard, let for 4*. a year, which can hardly be estimated at more than \u00a38. of our present money. Probably a similar house and grounds would now not let under \u00a330. or \u00a340. Land, however, seems to have let tolerably high. From 6d. to 2id. per acre for land, must be estimated at from 18_. to 70.?. of our present money, and a mill, rented at \u00a33. 6s. 8d. must be regarded as producing an income equivalent at least to \u00a3120. of modern currency. The outlay for labour and materials in the construction of such a building with its machinery would now be somewhat greater, and the rent would also be greater, but there is reason to assert that wages were higher in proportion to articles of subsistence than they now are, and that the inferiority in the first cost of a mill in the 1 3th century would consist in the lower price of the material and the rudeness of the workmanship. Ofthe prices of goods in Derby at that period we have little means of forming a correct judg ment, but we are warranted in saying that as far as labour and ingenuity entered into the pro duction, they bore a very high price with reference to the common articles of sustenance. In 1307, the goods of Walter de London, chaplain of Derby, were seized in consequence of an ex chequer-writ, and the value of some of the articles are stated in the sheriff's return.J Under such circumstances the prices named must be considered as much below the original cost. The corn is valued at \u00a37. and the hay at 20*. but as the quantity is not mentioned, we are unbenefit ed by this information. Among the household articles, we find a mazer or maple bowl, valued at 20*. ; six brazen jars, 18.. ; three plates, 6d. ; a basin with a wash stand or table, is. 6d. ; an iron stove, 2s. ; two pair of irons for a small cart (carriage), 1 8d. ; two pair of irons called handirons, is. ; and an iron chain, is. Most of these articles would be scarcely at the present day more than twice the nominal prices here assigned them, and consequently in proportion to the different value of money, they were at least sixty times dearer then than now. Hence we may conclude that none but the houses ofthe wealthy were tolerably furnished, and that many ofthe most common articles of convenience were then unknown even to some of the respectable burgesses of Derby, particularly when we find that a couple of sets of handirons were equal to the rent of a decent house. The town was at that early period represented in parliament by one of the burgesses, who was at the same time a trader in the town. Nicholas, the harness maker, whose encroachment on the public road is complained of, in the above memorial, served in the 26th and 28th parliaments of * This must mean that the encroachment was two feet, and extended in front to one hundred feet. \u2022f Gablum solarii : in the old Cambridge Dictionary we find a sollar or solar, explained to be a room at the top of the house, and the Latin word is solarium.

He gave to the prior of Derby one acre and a half of land in Derby. That the town continued to improve during the 14th century may easily be conjectured. The roads and bridges were repaired, as we learn from the grants made for that purpose, while, in 1330, the third of Edward III. who was still in his minority, the rising condition of the town did not escape the greedy vigilance of Mortimer, Earl of Marche, who, with queen Isabella, held the reins of government. The burgesses were summoned to show on what ground they claimed their privileges. Among these were the holding a fair on the Tuesday and Wednesday in Easter week, and another fair for seventeen days at the feast of St. James, and a borough market for four days every week, viz. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and from Thursday evening to Friday even ing. In proof of these and other important privileges, they produced the charter of king John, and the charters of additional rights granted them by Henry III. They were ordered to pay a fine of forty marks, and their liberties were restored to them. In the first year of the reign of Richard II. (1377) lay persons were assessed to a poll-tax, from which none but mendicants, and children under fourteen years of age were exempted : the return made for Derby was 1076 lay persons ; and if to these we add the clergy, secular and monastic, the children under fourteen, and the paupers, we may estimate the population at 2500. \u2014 John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who then governed the kingdom, showed much favour to the bur gesses of Derby, and obtained them a confirmation of their charter with additional privileges. For some portion ofthe 14th century Thomas Touchett, of Markeaton, farmed the king's dues in Derby, and afterwards Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who so successfully invaded Guienne and otherwise distinguished himself in the wars of Edward III. was allowed an annual rent issuino* out ofthe fee-farm of Derby. From the beginning of the reign of Richard II. until the first of Henry VI. we meet with no reference to the affairs of Derby. The regency with which the latter reign opened, following the example of those who acted in the preceding minority, called upon the burgesses of the town to produce their charters, and, of course, levied a fine on restoring to the inhabitants their rights. This has induced some writers to assert that the burgesses obtained additional privileges at that period. During the wars of the Roses, by which the reign of this unhappy sovereign was dis- tracted, the taxes were irregularly paid, and were sometimes altogether neglected through the changes of the paramount authorities. A heavy tax, levied in the decline of the Duke of Somer- set's administration, and on the eve of the rise of the York party into power, was granted by the parliament of 1453. As, in addition to tonnage and poundage, it gave to the crown the high sum of 23.. id. per sack, on wool for home consumption, and \u00a35. per sack on wool for exportation, this impost must have fallen with great severity on Derby, which was then a staple town for that important article. If this exorbitant duty was not directly resisted, it was not very resolutely enforced by the bailiffs of the borough, whose names were Richard Wryghte and Richard Ffox, and who were, at that period, accountable to the exchequer not only for the fee-farm-rent ofthe town but for all other duties in their own persons, lands and chattels. The tax was imposed by parliament in February, and on the 14th of October, in the same year, these two magistrates were summoned, and the liberties of the town were seized, until the amount that was due had been paid. The bailiffs were also fined twenty shillings for their neglect. It appears by this in cident that the borough was ruled by two bailiffs at that time, but we are unable to state when this alteration in the charter occurred. The charter of the town was again renewed at the commencement of the reigns of Edward IV. and Richard III. ; and during a great part ofthe former reign, the celebrated Lord Hastings was steward of the Corporation of Derby. We have seen that in the reign of Edward III. an annuity of \u00a340. per annum was granted to Henry of Lancaster, out of the fee-farm rent of the town ; a fact sufficient to disprove the asser tion of those who contend that the fee-farm rent of the town was a heirloom of the house of Lan caster, until it merged into the possession of the crown on the accession of Henry IV. In the"], [436, "408 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER reign of Henry VIII. it was granted for a short time to the Dean and Chapter of Burton-upon- Trent, but at the Reformation it was resumed by the crown, and in the reign of Edward VI. an annuity of \u00a3l6. per annum was granted to Sir Richard Morrison out ofthe fee-farm rent of Der by. The granddaughter and heiress of this Sir Richard having married Arthur, Lord Capel, the fee-farm is now payable to his descendant, George, Earl of Essex. The following is a copy of the form of the receipt for this rent to the burgesses of Derby : \" I George, Earl of Essex, son and heir of William- Anne-Holies, late Earl of Essex, deceased, who was son and heir of William, Earl of Essex, deceased, who was son and heir of Algernon, Earl of Essex, deceased, who was son and heir of Arthur, Earl of Essex, deceased, who was son and heir of the Right Honourable Elizabeth, dowager Lady Capel, deceased, who was sole heiress of Sir Charles Morrison, knight and baronet, deceased, who was son and heir of Sir Richard Mor rison, knight, deceased, do hereby acknowledge to have received on the day of the date of these presents, ofthe men ofthe town of Derby, by the hands of Edward Wood, gent, the sum of \u00a3l6. due to me for one whole year, ending on the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifteen. It being the sum of \u00a3l6. per annum granted to the said Richard Morrison, deceased, and his heirs, by king Edward VI. by his highness's let ters patent, appointed to be had and taken of the men of the town of Derby, out of the rents of the said town yearly. Witness my hand, Essex. There are no accounts respecting any territorial possessions held by the corporation in the name of the burgesses until the reign of queen Mary. It is probable that the expenses of the govern ment of the town were disbursed from the tolls, dues and fees which the charter gave the bailiffs authority to demand. In the second year of the reign of that unhappy and misguided sovereign the sum of \u00a3266. 13.?. id. was paid into the hands of the high chancellor, Peckhorn, with other considerations not specified, in consequence of which certain grants were made to the bailiffs and burgesses of Derby, out of the lands and other possessions previously belonging to the neighbour ing religious houses. The clear yearly value of these lands, messuages, tenements and tithes, was estimated at \u00a377. 2s. 7d. for which the bailiffs and burgesses were to pay the yearly rent to the crown of \u00a341. 14.. lid. \u2014 Out ofthe balance it was ordered by the same deed, that Is. should be paid annually to Thomas Ward; lOd. to the chamberlains; 12a\". to the churchwardens of All Saints; \u00a313. 6s. 8d. to the priests and ministers of All Saints; \u00a36. 13*. id. to a priest for St. Alkmund's ; \u00a3l. 13s. id. to the bailiffs and collectors, and \u00a313. l6s. 8a!. to the master and usher of the free school. The year before this grant is said to have been made, an act had been passed confirming the right of possession to those who then held the alienated lands and goods of the church, but there existed in the mind of the queen great reluctance to execute grants of that portion of the church property which remained in the hands of the crown. Her bigotry induced her to look forward to a period when even monasteries might be restored, and she regarded herself as their steward until that event should take place. To this we attribute the circumstances that the grant was not enrolled at that time, and consequently could not be legally acted upon. It was not until the last year of the reign of Elizabeth, when some parliamentary enquiries took place concerning grants of lands by the crown, that this grant of her predecessor was allowed to be enrolled, but she seems to have died before it was completed, as it did not issue from the privy seal until the first year of James I. It is probable that the burgesses considered themselves entitled to pasture their cattle on lands, the perpetual lease of which had been purchased with their money, for in the very year, 1603, that this grant received the royal signature, we find that they began breaking open the common grounds, about seven weeks before Michaelmas. The riot continued or recommenced the suc ceeding year, when three or four persons were thrown into gaol and an indictment preferred against them at the assizes. This did not lessen the determination ofthe burgesses to insist upon"], [437, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 409 their supposed rights, for the next year, 1605, they drove the cattle of Mr. John Needham, who seems to have rented the Siddals of the corporation, from the ground, and impounded them. How the affair terminated we have no means of knowing. At the latter end ofthe sixteenth and the beginning ofthe seventeenth century, the buildings of the town had greatly increased. The map published by Speed in 1610, exhibits all the old gales with their buildings. In Friar-gate, on the north side, the buildings do not appear to ex tend so far as the street now called Ford-street, and on the opposite side they reach something further. The land ofthe Friary with its enclosure is ofthe same compass as at present, but the old building is much farther removed from the road. After the dissolution of the religious houses, the site of the convent\" of Black Friars was granted to John Hinde, but it rapidly passed into other hands. Westward beyond the Friar-gate, and northward to St. Helen's, was an extent of fields, in the midst of which, to the south of the brook, stood the pinfold. On the north of Wil low-row there were a few houses, and Lodge-lane is delineated with hedges on each side, and some buildings at the corner where it comes into the Duffield road. Some houses in the Ward wick stand near the brook out of the regular line, and probably had gardens to the street in the front. In St. Peter's parish there appear to have been but few houses on the west side of the street; Bag-lane, the Morledge and the east side ofthe main street constituting the principal part of that division of the borough. Near the bottom of St. Michael's lane, the Derwent was crossed by a causeway a short distance below the bridge. Houses seem partially to stand in what are now called King and Queen street, but there is no name assigned to those avenues on the map. St. Alkmund's church appears to be accessible only on the northern side. In comparing this old map with a plan made a few years ago, we may estimate that although with respect to the actual site of the houses, the modern town is not more in proportion to Derby in the year 1610, than as five is to two ; or that it has about once and a half doubled its extent, yet we may estimate the number of habitations to be five or six times as many as they were at that period. The extensive spaces behind the houses, then used as gardens or open places for recreation, are now, for the most part, converted into throngly inhabited courts, inn yards, and back offices, and all the new buildings, with respect to the ground occupied, are raised so as to economize the land. The population at the opening of the seventeeth century may be estimated somewhere between five and six thousand. The rent of land averaged about 6s. 8d. per acre, but some land was let at 10*. and some as low as 2*. 4c?. A house on the south side of St. Mary's gate, was let by the churchwardens of All Saints to the Widow Willowes for 8*. per annum. A butcher's shop in the Rotten-row, was let for 16*. 8d. This is a slight sketch of the state of the town when king James, in l6l 1, confirmed the privi leges which the burgesses had enjoyed under his predecessors, and renewed their charter : a fa vour for which the full value was undoubtedly paid. We have already seen, that in the reign of Henry VI. the burgesses had two bailiffs, though Mr. Lysons, by an oversight, has stated that queen Elizabeth bestowed on the burgesses this privilege.* The corporation, according to the charter of king James, was made to consist of two bailiffs and twenty-four burgesses, with a re corder, chamberlain and other officers. The corporation was empowered to hold a court of record every second Tuesday; to have the sole return of writs; to keep a quarterly session, two court leets and six annual fairs : to be toll free throughout the kingdom ; to receive toll from all but the Duchy of Lancaster, which was to pay only half the sums charged on the inhabitants of other places. It was declared also, that the bailiffs should be justices ofthe peace for the year of their service and for the year next ensuing: and that no stranger should carry on a trade in the town except at markets and fairs. Twenty-six years afterwards, namely, in the year 1637, Charles I. granted the burgesses a new * There exists a catalogue of the two bailiffs appointed annually from the fifth year of the reign of Henry VIII. to the thirteenth of Charles I. See Appendix to Vol. I. 3 G"], [438, "410 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER charter, under which the Body Corporate was to consist of a mayor, nine aldermen, fourteen brethren and fourteen capital burgesses. Henry Mellor* was appointed the first mayor. Shortly after the grant of this charter to the town of Derby, the long parliament was chosen, and the fatal contest began, which subjected the nation to a series of severe troubles, and cost the monarch his life. The members for this borough in that parliament were Mr. William Allestrey, the recorder, and Mr. Nathaniel Hallowes, and in the parliament summoned by Cromwell, were Gervase Bennet, an alderman of Derby, and John Dalton, whose place was subsequently supplied by Mr. Robert Baynbrigge. Of such particulars of the civil war between Charles I. and his par liament, as had any relation to this town or county, mention is made in our General History, and we shall therefore confine ourselves in this place to a few local circumstances. At the termination ofthe Scottish war, the king, about the beginning of August, 1641, visited that part of his dominions. In passing through Derby, on the 11th of that month, he made Sir John Curzon of Kedleston a baronet of Nova Scotia, and likewise created Sir Francis Rodes of Barlborough a baronet. In the next year, on the 22nd of August, the king set up the royal standard at Nottingham, on which occasion about twenty Derby men marched there and entered his service. On the 13th of September, Charles, with his army passed through Derby in his way to Shrewsbury : he borrowed of the Corporation the sum of \u00a3300. and all the small arms they could furnish, both of which he promised to return at the end of the war. Very shortly after this visit ofthe king to this town, Sir John Gellt was commissioned by the Earl of Essex, who commanded the parliamentary forces, to raise a regiment, of which Sir John was to be colonel, and his brother, Mr. Thomas Gell, lieutenant-colonel. On the 31st of October, 1642, Sir John arrived at Derby with between three and four hundred men, and there appointed officers and gave them commissions. He was joined by Captain White, from Nottinghamshire, with twenty-seven dragoons, which were increased to one hundred and forty by recruits raised in this town and its neighbourhood. The principal officers of Sir John Gell, were Major Mollanus, and Captains White, Saunders, Mellor and Swetnam ; he was also joined by Sir George Gresley with a troop of horse. The nobility and gentry ofthe county were mostly royalists, but the vigi lance and activity of Sir John and the soldiers under his command prevented the town of Derby from falling into their hands. The various expeditions which this spirited commander conducted belong to the General History of the County. In the summer of 1643, General Sir Thomas Fairfax, one of the principal leaders of the parliamentary forces, repaired to Derby with all his horse, and continued there two or three days. He desired that Sir John Gell would let him have four or five hundred musketeers to march with him towards Chesterfield and onward into York shire. Sir John replied that he had not above five hundred men in Derby to defend the town, and that Hastings had at that time at least two thousand at Lichfield, Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Tutbury, still looking for an opportunity to surprise Derby, if his horses had marched out of it ; because it was well known, that if Derby were taken, Nottingham could not long hold out, and then all the north side of the Trent was lost. Nevertheless Colonel Gell told him that he had one hundred men at Winfield manor, of which number he should have sixty, besides some from the companies stationed at Wingerworth and Chatsworth, making altogether the number he required. Sir Thomas Fairfax was satisfied with this arrangement, and immediately marched to Chester field, where he was accompanied by the Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Gell and Mr. Hallowes, who were two of the Parliamentary Committee. About this time the successes of the royalists were very considerable in various parts of the * Bancroft, a poet of no inferior talents, and a native of Derbyshire, complimented the new Mayor in an Epigram. \" To Mr. Henry Mellor, the first Mayor of Derby.

The Earl of Newcastle invaded Derbyshire, and crossed the county in his way to Cheshire, encouraging the loyalists to attempt the seizure of Derby. In consequence of this, many of the surrounding gentry armed their tenants, and conflicts took place close to the town until Major Mollanus, who had been harassing the army of Newcastle in its march, suddenly re turned. The troops of the Derbyshire loyalists were entirely defeated at Tissington, after having for some weeks overawed the peasantry, and completely prevented them from attending the Derby market with supplies of provisions. This was early in the spring of 1644. In the next year, on the 1 4th of June, the battle so fatal to the royal -cause, that the king's affairs never afterwards exhibited any symptoms of success, was fought at Naseby in Northamptonshire. Sir John Gell had been previously commanded to draw his troops out of Derby and to harass the march of the king, who had taken Leicester by storm on the 31st of May, but the battle was fought while he was waiting at Nottingham to be joined by some companies of dragoons from other counties. The Derby troop served under General Pointz at the storming of Belvoir castle, where eleven were slain and twenty-seven were wounded. On account of their service and valour on this occasion, the parliament voted that \u00a340. should be bestowed upon the Derby sol diers as drink-money. At a sharp skirmish at Stoke, on the 1st of January, 1646, the loss ofthe Derby troop was four slain and thirty wounded. The horse fled at the beginning of the engage ment, but the firm conduct of the foot induced Pointz to thank them in the open field for their valiant behaviour. Soon after this the troop was disbanded ; on which occasion the horse soldiers received \u00a34. 6s. each, and the foot soldiers \u00a3l. 6s. The officers had no pecuniary remuneration. This negligence was attributed to the commissioners who superintended the administration of this district. The majority of them were suspected to be royalists, and until the battle of Marston Moor on the 3rd of July, 1644, had given the parliament a strong prospect of ultimate success, the exertions of the officers met with little encouragement. The dismantling ofthe garrisons of Derby and Win field manor was placed under the management of the Committee for the affairs of Ireland, who were empowered to grant such officers as were willing to engage in the Irish expedition a month's pay in advance, and to allow the soldiers their quarters with other good encouragement. Colonel Roper, a person of great worth in Derbyshire, was to command the horse, and Colonel Ireland the foot. Respecting the arrears, every reasonable satisfaction was to be made ; those who were willing to enlist themselves for Ireland being considered as deserving particular en couragement. Derby remained tolerably tranquil during the protectorate, but on the death of Cromwell, the hopes of the royalists revived, and they being now supported by the presbyterians, whom the puritans had by their open enmity estranged from their cause, a general insurrection was medi- tated. The kingdom was in general discontented with the existing government. Richard Crom- well had neither the ambition or the talents of his father : the long parliament resumed its sitting, and the protector resigned his authority. The moment was favourable for any design either in behalf of Charles II. or for the presbyterians to seize from the independents the powers which they had themselves enabled them to maintain, but the friends and enemies of episcopacy were not to be confided in by each other. The plot was discovered, and many of those who had en- gaged in it were imprisoned. Still with the belief that as soon as the insurrection should be begun, and a declaration of their purpose should be issued, their enterprise would be supported by similar demonstrations of the inclinations of the people throughout the country, Sir George Booth and Sir Thomas Middleton issued a memorial, which had been widely though privately circulated, and at the head of about three thousand men took possession of Chester. Lambert, the parliamentary general, hastened to meet this force, and engaging them near Nantwich, totally dispersed them, on the 19th of August, l6o.9. Sir George was taken prisoner, disguised in a female habit, four days after at Newport Pagnel. Some days previous to the defeat of Sir George Booth, his declaration had been brought into Derby by Colonel Charles White. The high sheriff (John Mundy, of Markeaton, esq.) and the magistrates, who, it is probable, were already engaged in the plot, caused it to be publicly pro-"], [440, "412 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER claimed in the market-place, upon Friday, the 12th of August. This day was, for some time afterwards, remembered by the name of White's Friday. An insurrection was the consequence of this step, with which General Lambert, who was then at Stafford on his march to Chester, being made acquainted, he instantly despatched two hundred and fifty cavalry, under the com mand of Major Grove, to suppress the rising at Derby. The disturbance was, however, at an end before the troops had proceeded further than Uttoxeter. It appears that on the market day, on which Sir George Booth's declaration was read, the militia was in the town, with the commis sioners appointed to raise and superintend that force. The insurrection was tolerably general : the shops were shut up, and many of the horses of the militia were seized. Captain Doughty, of the militia, shook hands with Colonel White, and said to him \" we are agreed.\" He then called upon the people to arm, induced his own company to join them, pointed out the magazine of powder, nominated officers and gave orders for the town bells to be rung backward. In the meantime Colonel Sanders, Colonel Mitchell, Major Burton, and Captain Hope, parliamentary officers resident in the town, came up, and Doughty would have arrested Captain Hope, but he was prevented by Colonel Mitchell. The people were after a short time persuaded by Colonel Sanders to withdraw to Nun's-green ; and there they professed their attachment to him, and begged of him to be their leader. On his refusing to do so, the crowd gradually dispersed. On the next day one troop of horse from Uttoxeter having entered the town, the high sheriff and the magistrates were compelled to read, in the market-place, the parliamentary proclamation, wherein Sir George and his adherents were declared traitors. Many of the noblemen and gentlemen were instantly arrested. Towards the latter end ofthe reign of Charles II. the nation was much agitated concerning the succession to the crown, as the Duke of York, the King's brother, was a professed papist. In two houses of commons, which were hastily dissolved, a bill had been brought in for the purpose of setting aside his royal highness's claims. Frustrated in this mode of proceeding, the protestant party formed an association to effect that design, which they had now no hopes of accomplishing by legal means. The articles of this association were powerfully drawn up by the celebrated Earl of Shaftesbury, but the bill of indictment preferred against him in November, 1681, before the grand jury of Middlesex, was thrown out. In order to counteract the impression which this decision was calculated to make, the grand juries, at the ensuing assizes throughout the kingdom, were called upon to display their loyalty in addresses declarative of their detestation of such as sociation. The following is the address of the grand jury of Derbyshire, held at Derby on the 20th of March, 1682. \" To the King's Most Excellent Majestie. \" Wee, your Majesties most dutifull and loyall subjects, the Grand-Jury sworne as the repre sentative body of your Majesties County of Derby, at the Assizes held at Derby, for the saide County, the twentieth day of March, in the four and thirtyeth yeare of your Majestie's most happy raigne, being filled with amazement as well as detestation at the restless attempts of that hellish faction, who, haveing made the murder of your royall Father the glory (tho' it was the infamie) of their actions^and would crowne them with the destruction of your royall Majestie, your law full successors, and the very monarchy of the nation, by an Association, which could have no less intendment or construction, canot withoute stupidety and ingratitude (in this surprisinge circumstance) omitt the repeating of our loyaltie to your Majestie in our just abhorrence of this wicked confederacy and all the abettors of it ; resolving and humbly declaring to your Majestie and the whole world, that wee will alwayes at the expense of our lives and fortunes endeavour to support, preserve, and defend your royall p'son, your heirs and successors in the rite -line, and the government as now by lawe established against all associations, consperracyes, attempts and pretensions whatsoever, and that no p'son who shall not have the same loyall sense with us shall have no sufferage, or voate from us for any office, employment, or trust whatsoever."], [441, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 413 \" Signed by the Grand- Jury, whose names are subscribed with the concurrence, with the Jus tices then and there present, and others freeholders of the saide County.

The association was publicly burnt in the market-place. As Charles II. in the year 1682, ruled the nation without a parliament, he was dependant upon the liberality of his subjects for the supplies of his exchequer, and one of the expedients which loyal corporations had recourse to in order to manifest their attachment to the court was the sur render of their charters, under the pretence of obtaining some new immunities, for which a hand some gratuity was paid to the crown. Numerous charters were surrendered in that year. This business was managed, in Derby, by Mr. Bagnold, the town clerk, during the mayoralty of Mr. Edward Walker. The charges amounted to \u00a3400. The charter thus obtained is that on which the Corporation is at present constituted. A copy of it will be found in the Appendix to the first Volume. In the year 1685, when James II. contrary to the Act of Parliament then extant, required the test to be taken by every one possessed of a public office, and told the commons that instead of the militia he should employ a standing army, in which, it was well known he had appointed a great many Catholic officers, the house of commons voted an address to his Majesty, remonstrat ing against the illegality of his purpose. This address was very ill received by that despotic prince, and his own determination was re-asserted, in violent expressions. \" The commons,\" says Hume, \" were so daunted with this reply, that they kept silence a long time ; and when Coke, member for Derby, rose up and said, ' I hope we are all Englishmen, and not to be fright ened with a few hard words ;' so little spirit appeared in that assembly, often so refractory and mutinous, that they sent him to the Tower for bluntly expressing a free and generous spirit.\" In HiS8, subsequent to the landing ofthe Prince of Orange at Exeter, the Earl of Devonshire entered Derby, at the head of a small retinue, consisting, according to some accounts, of about five hundred men. He invited several gentlemen to dinner, and openly declared his sentiments in favour of the Prince. He read to the mayor (Mr. Cheshire) and to the inhabitants of the town, the Prince's declaration, and delivered the following, drawn up by himself and others of the no bility and gentry. \" The true copy of a paper delivered by the Lord Devonshire to the Mayor of Derby, where he quartered the one and twentieth of November, 1688. \" We, the nobility and gentry of the northern parts of England, being deeply sensible of the calamities that threaten these kingdoms, do think it our duty, as Christians and good subjects, to endeavour, what in us lies, the healing of our present distractions and preventing greater. And as with grief we apprehend the sad consequences that may arise from the landing of an army in this kingdom from foreign parts ; so we cannot but deplore the occasion given for it by so many invasions made of late years on our religion and laws. And whereas we cannot think of any other expedient to compose our differences, and prevent effusion of blood, than that which procured a settlement in these kingdoms, after the late civil wars, the meeting and sitting of a parliament freely and duly chosen, we think ourselves obliged (as far as in us lies) to promote it ; and the rather because the Prince of Orange (as appears by his Declaration) is willing to submit his own pretensions, and all other matters to their determination : We heartily wish, and humbly pray, that his Majesty would consent to this expedient, in order to a future settlement ; and hope that"], [442, "414 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER such a temperament may be thought of, as that the army now on foot may not give any interrup tion to the proceeding of a parliament. But if to the great misfortune and ruin of these kingdoms, it should prove otherwise, we farther declare, that we will to our utmost defend the protestant reli gion, the laws ofthe kingdom, and the rights and liberties ofthe people.\" It is not stated with what tone this address was received ; but it appears that the inhabitants of Derby were tardy in declaring their sentiments. On the arrival of some troops bearing the standard ofthe Prince of Orange, the mayor was afraid to billet them ; but a spirited constable, named Cooke, sent them into quarters. We have a very particular and interesting account of the population of Derby, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, by Mr. William Woolley, who resided at Darley Abbey in the reign of queen Anne, and wrote his manuscript (preserved in the College of Arms) about the year 1712. He describes it to be in his time, a very large, populous, rich and well frequented borough-town, few inland towns in the kingdom equalling it. It had above seven hundred free burgesses, and the number of inhabitants were estimated at four thousand. Though not very regularly built, yet it had a great many very good houses, especially on all parts of the outside of the town, mostly of brick, of which there are (he says) as good made in this town, and as cheap as almost in any part of England. Many of the residents were persons of quality, and many coaches were kept in it. The religious house called St. Helen's had been converted into dwelling houses with good or chards, and there was an alley or footway in the middle of the street called St. Helen's. Mr. Woolley was decidedly of opinion that the tower of All Saints' church was built in the time of Henry VII. He describes the market-place as a square with good buildings about it : on the east side is a handsome large pile of building called the court, which helps to grace it much, as does the cross, under which there is a conduit of good water brought (he says) out ofthe Newlands. There is also the guild-hall on the south-west corner of the place, where the Corporation meets, under which is the town gaol, but it is at present a very tattered, ill-contrived, ill-looking building. Over against it stands a good handsome hall, erected by Mr. Crompton, part on the butchery on the west side of the place, and part on pillars, where the market people that sell butter, eggs and poultry stand ; and behind it is part of the Rotten-row. It is said (adds Mr. Woolley) he built this hall with a design to make an exchange with the corporation for theirs ; at present it is only used by some button makers, that work in it. The mill beside the Markeaton brook, at the bottom of St. Mary's-gate, belonged to Mr. Osborne, who built the house now occupied by Samuel Evans, esq. and over the pool stood the ducking-stool. The site of the old nunnery, with some adjacent mea dows were in the possession of Simon Degge, esq. (Sir Simon Degge, recorder of the borough) but the green belonged to the free burgesses, and was made use of by bakers to lay stacks of gorse, carpenters to lay their timber, and brick-makers. In the middle of it stood the kennel for the town hounds; for the site of which the gentlemen of the hunt used to present to the mayor a brace of hares, dressed, towards his dinner, on Michaelmas day. The town-pinfold also stood upon Nun's green. Below the Morledge creek, over against the lower wear that turned the stream of the Der went down to the Holme's mills, stood the residence of Mrs. Musters, an heiress of the Mundy family : the mills belonged to her husband. The Holmes was planted round with trees, and was the pleasantest walk about the town. It was a common pasture belonging to the burgesses, and used by them for bleaching cloth. To the westward of the mill stood a good house, on the side of Cockpit-hill, built by Mr. Beardsley, which was pulled down so lately as 1819. On the south side of the Osmaston road, where it branches off from the London road, stood a few poor houses, called Knock-a-down. On the hill westward were the remains of St. Leonard's, a religious lazar-house. The gallows stood till within a few years past, a small distance farther to the west, on the Normanton road. The house near Babington lane (now belonging to the Sitwell family) was then in the pos session of Sir Simon Degge. It was built by the Mellors. At the bridge over the brook at the bottom of the corn-market, stood the county gaol, described by Mr. Woolley as a convenient brick and stone building, with an entrance to the corn-market under a large, handsome stone arch. The Thorn Tree alehouse, on the south side of the brook, is said to have been, at that time, long famous for the best ale in the town. A good house adjoined it, built by Mr. Burton,"], [443, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 415 but then recently purchased by Mr. Wagstaffe. This house has been enlarged, modernized and almost re-built, by Joseph Strutt, esq. the present possessor. On the brook side stood a good house, built by Mr. Green : in 1712 it belonged to Mr. Barnes ; it was probably that next the Independent chapel, recently occupied by Mr. Charles Callow, and now a flour warehouse. In the Wardwick stood several good houses belonging to Mr. Mundy, Mr. Gisborne and Mr. Roberts. The Friary, in the Friar gate, had been converted into a good house, belonging to Mr. Dalton. This house was rebuilt by Samuel Crompton, esq. and is now the property of Henry Mozley, esq. The Presbyterian meeting-house, in the Friar-gate, was then the only dissenting place of worship in the town. The cattle and horse fairs were kept at the upper end ofthe Friar-gate, as they continue to be. Large's hospital for clergymen's widows was then designed but not com pleted. \u2014 It may be surmised from this account of Mr. Woolley 's, that the town had not increas ed so much in extent as in density of population and the builcf ngs of some of the principal in habitants, during the preceding century. Party feeling ran high in Derby, as indeed it did throughout the kingdom, between the adhe- rents of the high and low church. Most of the leading men of the town and the county were Tories, and not a few were even Jacobites. In the year 1 709, the high sheriff, George Sacheve- rell, esq. of Callow, in the parish of Wirksworth, was attended by his chaplain, Dr. Henry Sa- cheverell, who, at the summer assizes, preached a violent sermon, replete with high church prin- ciples, at All Saints' church, on the 15th of August. It was approved of by the majority of his hearers, and he was requested, by the grand-jury, to print it. He did so, under the title of the \" Communication of Sin.\" A similar sermon was preached by the reverend doctor before the Lord-Mayor and Corporation of London, on the 5th of November, in the same year, and the latter seems to have contained several passages previously preached in the Derby assize sermon. On the 13th of December a complaint was made in the House of Commons relative to these publica- tions, and a resolution was carried, condemning them as \"malicious, scandalous and seditious libels, highly reflecting on the queen, the late revolution, and the protestant succession : tending to alienate the affections of her majesty's subjects, and create jealousies and divisions among them.\" In consequence of this resolution, it was resolved that he should be impeached on the charge of high crimes and misdemeanours at the bar of the House of Lords. The trial produced long and vehement debates among the peers, and the public mind was so excited in his favour, that multi- tudes attended him to the House of Lords and strove to kiss his hand. Great disturbances took place in London, and the mob threatened to pull down the houses of those members of either house of parliament who favoured his prosecution. Meeting-houses and the private dwellings of eminent dissenters were destroyed. These riots continued until the beginning of March, and some ofthe queen's servants were discovered to be concerned in them. There existed strong suspicions that the queen favoured the high church party. On the 20th of March, the House of Lords came to a decision, and the Doctor was found guilty, by a majority of sixty-nine to fifty-two. He was suspended for three years, and the sermons were ordered to be burnt. On account of this mild sentence, the Tories considered that they had obtained a triumph, and bonfires with other rejoic- ings took place in Derby as well as in London. Sir Thomas Parker, who had some time previ- ously been recorder of the borough of Derby, was one of the parliamentary managers of this trial, but during the progress of it he was appointed Lord Chief Justice ofthe Queen's Bench. The high church party continued very prevalent in Derby, and on the accession of George I. it was frequently displayed. On the landing of the Pretender in Scotland, tumults became fre- quent. \" There were,\" says Mr. Flutton, \" several persons in the town who wished for the re establishment of the Pretender on the throne of England. Among the Jacobites, three of the established clergymen ofthe town ranked themselves. Sturges,* of All Saints', prayed publicly for king James, but after a moment's reflexion said, ' I mean king George.' The congregation became tumultuous : the military gentlemen drew their swords, and ordered him out of the pul pit, into which he never returned.\" But whatever were the predominant politics of the borough, * We doubt whether Mr. Hutton is correct in this name."], [444, "416 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER at that period, there can be no doubt that it continued to increase in population and commercial activity. In the year 1717, Mr. John Lombe began to construct his silk mill on one of the islands or heights in the channel of the Derwent, and erected temporary machines in the town hall and various other places. On the 7th of April, 1720, the act for making the river Derwent naviga ble, received the royal assent. Various manufactures were either improving or commencing, and the town was manifestly rising to that station in the general trade and interest of the kingdom which it has since attained. By an estimate made from the parish registers, upon the admitted ratio of one death annually among forty persons, the population of the town, in 1 732, was about 696O. On the 20th of September, 1733, a new fair was opened, at which cheese sold from 16*. to 20*. per hundred. A proposition to add the laws of excise to the laws of the customs, was introduced into the House of Commons, by Sir Robert Walpole, on the 14th of March, 1733. This occasioned a violent sensation throughout the country. The House of Commons was daily beset with crowds, not of rabble but of tradesmen, warehouse-men and general dealers, who, as they expressed their wishes with earnestness and insulted the friends of the minister as they entered the house, were desig nated by the chancellor as ' sturdy beggars ;' an appellation that was never forgotten during Wal pole's administration. The debates were warm, but the resolutions, after two days' discussion, were carried, and, on the 4th of April, a bill was brought in for an inland excise duty on tobacco. A deep sense of the consequence of extending the most degrading mode of levying taxes occa sioned public meetings at London, Nottingham, Coventry and various other places. The minis ters were terrified at this display of public opposition, and dropped their intended measure. The members of parliament who had resisted this unpopular attempt of the government were received by their constituents with demonstrations of satisfaction, and at the summer assizes in Derby, the high sheriff and grand jury presented an address to the county and town members (Sir Nathaniel Curzon, bart. and Godfrey Clarke, esq. for the county ; Lord James Cavendish and Charles Stan hope, for the borough) \u2014 returning them most sincere and hearty thanks for their unwearied and steady application, when the liberties and properties of themselves and fellow-subjects were \"\u25a0 of late so remarkably attacked.\" This parliament was dissolved on the 16th of April, 1734, after having shown symptoms of dis affection to the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, and even discussed an unsuccessful motion for repealing the Septennial act. At the general election which ensued, the candidates for the bo rough were Lord James Cavendish, uncle to the Duke of Devonshire, the Honourable Charles Stanhope, brother to the Earl of Chesterfield, William Curzon and Richard Harpur, esqrs. The two first were chosen. The contest for the county was carried on with considerable ardour. The candidates were Lord Charles Cavendish, Sir Nathaniel Curzon, bart. and Henry Harpur, esq. The object ofthe Tories was to throw out Lord Charles. The election lasted from the 16th to the 23rd of May, and the numbers at the close were for Lord Charles Cavendish, 2081 ; Sir Nathaniel Curzon, bart. 2043; Henry Harpur, esq. 1796. The mob became outrageous at the success of his Lordship : the people assembled before the county hall and opposed his being chaired. A conflict occurred between his adherents and those of the other party. A great deal of mischief en sued : windows were broken, and several persons were severely wounded : a man had a sharp stick thrust into his eye, as he endeavoured to prevent the crowd from entering the gates of the county hall yard, and the injury occasioned his death. At the next general election Lord James Cavendish was again returned for the borough, but having, on the close ofthe year 1740, accepted the colonelcy of a cavalry regiment, called Dallo way's dragoons, he vacated his seat, and Lord Duncannon, son-in-law to the Duke of Devon shire, was nominated by the Whig interest. His Lordship had for his competitor, German Pole, esq. of Radbourn, who was strongly supported by the Tories. The poll was opened at ten o'clock in the morning of Saturday, May 11, 1741, and continued until six in the evening. On the fol lowing Monday, the polling began at nine o'clock and continued until about two in the afternoon. Upon closing the poll-books, the numbers were, for Lord Duncannon, 346; for German Pole, esq. 300. This election gives us the number of freemen who then voted, and since, in a subse-"], [445, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 417 a subsequent election, the same number (6i6) is stated to have come to the poll, we may estimate this to be the number of freemen at that period. Towards the close of the year 1745, the town of Derby was distinguished by a great political event deeply connected with the protestant succession to the crown of these realms. It was the goal or boundary of a bold and desperate invasion of Prince Charles Edward, the son of the Pre tender, for the recovery of a throne which his ancestors had twice lost by their bigotry and their mistaken notions of hereditary authority. Charles Edward was about five-and-twenty years of age : in person he was tall and handsome, and he possessed intrepidity and an ardent love of enterprize : his manners were however reserv ed, and his intellect neither strong nor comprehensive. His youth, his hereditary claims, and the misfortunes of his family procured him adherents and even personal admirers, but both he and his counsellors seem to have wanted talent to seize the advantages which the circumstances of the period offered them. The whole nation was in a state of suffering and discontent. Many ofthe best constitutional securities of the people's property and liberty had been made to give way to measures for securing the stability of the throne. Taxes, in that worst form of imposts, the excise duties, had been greatly extended, with other vexatious modes of maintaining an expensive court, and providing for the cost of continental wars for the preservation principally of the king's hered itary foreign dominions. But neither the young pretender or any of his friends had any notion of the interests and rights of the people : all he could ask them was to undergo a fresh series of calamities in order to place his father on a throne which had been possessed by his ancestors. The people of England, and even the majority ofthe people of Scotland, were not inclined to believe that fifty-seven years of exile had rendered the Stuarts of that day less bigoted or less despotic in principle than their forefathers. The Chevalier de St. George, the son of James II. and the father of Charles Edward, had in his youth displayed great courage. He had the command of the household troops in the French service, and at the battle of Malplaquet, he led his regiment twelve times to the charge. In the last charge he received a severe wound in the right arm. During the spring of the preceding year, when he had scarcely attained the twentieth year of his age, he attempted the invasion of Scotland, but, through the vigilance of the British fleet, was compelled to return to Dunkirk without having effected a landing. On the accession of George I. he published a manifesto as- serting his claims to the British crown, which was extensively circulated in private among his ad- herents, who were then numerous in consequence of the strong and irritating measures of the tri- umphant Whigs. . His standard was raised in Scotland by the Earl of Mar, and on the 22nd of December, 1715, he landed at Peterhead near Aberdeen, but the strength of his partisans was broken before his arrival, and he was compelled to make his escape in a small French vessel which lay in the harbour of Montrose. Thus discomfitted, he retired to Lorraine, and afterwards to Rome, where he resided until the spring of 1719, when Cardinal Alberoni, then prime minis- ter to the king of Spain, invited him to Madrid, where he was received with royal honours. A fleet, with a considerable body of troops, was equipped and placed under the command of the Duke of Ormond, in order to effect a descent upon the coast of Scotland. The ships were dis- persed by a storm, and two only arrived at their destination. The Marquess of Tullibardine with three hundred Spaniards and a large quantity of arms, landed on the 4th of April, at Kintale in Ross-shire, and seized the castle of Donan. A few Highlanders joined them, but at the approach of the king's troops, the Spaniards laid down their arms, and the commotion their arrival had ex- cited was suppressed. Peace being concluded shortly afterwards with Spain, the Chevalier de St. George retired to the Papal States, where he lived in retirement upon a pension allowed him by the Holy See. The spring of 1744 opened fresh prospects to the exiled Stuarts of immediate support and eventual success. The Cardinal de Tencin, an intimate friend of the Pretender, had gained con siderable influence in directing the councils ofthe French ministry, whom he encouraged to be lieve that the people of Great Britain were ready to throw off the authority of the Brunswick family and restore the line of their ancient sovereigns. An expedition under the command of 3 H"], [446, "418 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Count Saxe was prepared, and vessels were assembled at Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne. Prince Charles Edward, on account ofthe increasing years and infirmities of his father, was invited from Rome by the French government in order to be placed at the head of the enterprize. The Brit ish dominions were in a state of great agitation and alarm, and the country was occupied in the means of defence, when the gratifying intelligence arrived, that the principal part ofthe French fleet had been driven back to their ports with great loss, by stormy and contrary winds. The vigilance of the British navy was awakened, and admiral Sir John Norris so unremittingly watch ed the French ports, that the court of Versailles, perceiving their design to be frustrated, began to treat the young adventurer with neglect, and to discourage his ambitious views. Charles Edward was however in that period of life when hope is seldom relinquished while any probable means of attaining the object aimed at present themselves, and his partisans, who were certainly numerous both in England and Scotland, encouraged him to indulge the expectation, that as soon as he should set his feet on British territory, there would be a general insurrection in his favour. He therefore resolved to watch for an opportunity of presenting himself to his friends in Britain, even without the aid of French arms, should they continue to be refused him. A year elapsed before he was master of sufficient resources to carry his design into execution upon the most limited scale. By the summer of 1745, he found himself able by the contribu tions of his adherents to purchase a quantity of arms, with which he embarked in a small frigate, and sailed from an obscure port in the west of France. A vessel of war which accompanied him with a larger supply of arms, and nearly a hundred French officers, was encountered by a British cruiser, and compelled, in a crippled condition, to seek safety in Brest harbour. In eighteen days he arrived at one of the little desert islands of the Hebrides, and shortly afterwards his standard was raised at Glen-Sinnan, where he was joined by several clans of hardy Highlanders. He marched at the head of about twelve hundred men across the country, and at Perth caused his father to be proclaimed king of Great Britain. His progress was unimpeded. The royal troops in Scotland were few. George II. was visiting his continental dominions, and his son, the Duke of Cumberland, was engaged in unsuccessful hostilities in the Netherlands. The rebel army, increasing daily in numbers, entered Edinburgh, and the prince made the palace of Holy-rood house his residence. He caused his father to be proclaimed at the market-place, and seized upon the public money. In the meantime Sir John Cope had drawn together about three thousand troops, and encamped at Preston-Pans, where he was attacked by the young ad venturer at the head of two thousand four hundred Highlanders, who completely defeated him, and became masters of his tents, baggage and military chest. The prince was now in possession of all Scotland except the fortresses, which he wanted artillery to make his own. His forces were augmented. He levied taxes, and compelled the merchants of Glasgow to accommodate him with a considerable loan. But while he was so far successful, he could not but perceive that he was far from being secure. The Duke of Argyle and several other Scottish lords, in the interest of the court, were arming their vassals, and large bodies of troops hastily brought from Holland and Flanders, were on their march to the north, under the command of Marshal Wade. The young Pretender accordingly resolved to try the fidelity of his English adherents, who by their letters had encouraged him to show himself among them. At the head of little more than five thousand men he resolved to make an irruption into England, and at the beginning of November he invested Carlisle, which immediately surrendered. He then advanced to Penrith, Preston and Manchester, where he was joined by two hundred English catholics under Colonel Townley. At Manchester he was receiv- ed with illuminations and other public testimonies of congratulation, but the English were cau tious in joining his standard, and he began to be aware that his situation was become extremely critical. Marshal Wade was marching on his left towards Northumberland, and the Duke of Cumberland, who had landed from Flanders, was advancing from London with a large body of troops to intercept his progress. Still he was encouraged by the promises of his adherents in various parts of the kingdom to persevere, and finding the bridge over the Mersey at Warrington broken down, he crossed that river at Stockport. He then passed through Macclesfield and Con-"], [447, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 419 gleton, and would probably have proceeded onward by Birmingham and Oxford towards London had he not been informed that the Duke of Cumberland was awaiting him in that direction, ready to give him battle. He therefore turned off suddenly to the left and entered Ashbourn, where, during his short stay, he took up his abode at Ashbourn hall. Preparations had been making during the autumn for arming the people throughout the coun try, but it was apparent that the government was mistrustful of the spirit of the nation. In Sep tember an order in council was addressed through the Lord Lieutenants of counties, calling upon the Justices of Peace to put in force with severity the laws for disarming papists or persons sus pected of being papists, for preventing persons of that description from keeping a horse of above \u00a35. in value, and for restraining them from going more than five miles from their dwellings. In consequence of instructions from London, his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, called a meeting at the George Inn, Derby, on the 28th of September, \" to consider of such measures as are fit to be taken for the support of the royal person and government of his majesty king George, and our happy constitution in church and state, at a time when rebellion is carrying on in favour of a po pish Pretender.\" The clerk of the peace announced this meeting in a circular letter addressed to the clergy and gentry of the county individually, and the appointed assembly is stated in the Derby Mercury of that period to have been \" the greatest appearance of gentlemen ever seen here.\" An association was entered into and subscribed ; and a grand entertainment was provided at the inn, for the whole of the company, at the expense of the Lord Lieutenant, who, with his eldest son, the Marquess of Hartington, attended on this important occasion. After dinner, a considerable sum was subscribed for the purposes of the association, and other persons who did not attend sent subsequently very liberal donations. On the Thursday following, another meeting was held at the King's Head, at which the Duke of Devonshire and the Marquess of Hartington were present. At this it was proposed to raise two companies of volunteers. This was opposed by several gentlemen present, who insisted that it would be more constitutional to call out the militia, a species of force in which was placed the legitimate defence of the country, and on which the government ought to rely. This proposition was heard with much dissatisfac tion and speedily overruled. It was determined to raise the volunteers : the Marquess of Hart ington and Sir Nathaniel Curzon, the representatives of the county in parliament, were appoint ed colonels. The Association* was signed by one hundred and seventy-two of the wealthiest and most in fluential gentlemen in the county, and was submitted to the king for his approbation. On the 28th of October, another meeting, attended by his Grace the Lord Lieutenant of the County, was held at the Talbot Inn. At this meeting an estimate was put in and agreed to, that the expenses of each ofthe two regiments, consisting of six hundred men, would amount to \u00a31205. 9*- a month, and the officers were appointed to raise the men. In order that the county magistrates might the better employ their influence in encouraging their tenants to enlist and be vigilant in their several districts, the session for the county was adjourned from time to time at the pleasure of the Lord Lieutenant. While these means for the defence of the town and county were in agitation, the alarm of the inhabitants increased. From the middle until the close of November expresses were sent to the Duke of Devonshire respecting the movements ofthe enemy, which his Grace instantly commu nicated through the mayor to the people of Derby. From some copies of these expresses still ex tant, it appears that the royal armies were little acquainted with the movements of each other or of the enemy, and that the young Pretender, by turning his march towards Derby, baffled both the Marshal and the Duke of Cumberland, who might have compelled him to a general engage ment long before he could have advanced into the very centre of England. Marshal Wade, at the head of sixteen thousand men, was at Newcastle-upon-Tyne when the city of Carlisle was taken by the enemy, whom he might have intercepted in their further progress towards the \u25a0 The copy ofthe Association with the names affixed to it will be found in the Appendix to volume II. with other documents relative to the raising of these regiments."], [448, "420 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER south had he used the requisite despatch, but we find him, three days after that occurrence, no farther from Newcastle than Hexham. The very day previous to the entrance of the rebels into Ashbourn, the royal Duke was no further off than Lichfield. The particulars of the entrance of the rebels into Derby will be best detailed in the following extracts from the Derby Mercury of that period, and Hutton's History of Derby: Nov. 28. At a Common Hall held on Tuesday last by the Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, &c. of this Borough, it was agreed (in order to procure the most certain and speedy intelligence ofthe progress ofthe rebels) to fix upon proper persons to bring despatches from his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, immediately after his Grace receives them, to the Mayor of this Borough ; one of which came yesterday, and brought an account that seven or eight of the rebels came to Preston in Lancashire, on Tuesday morning about eleven o'clock, the rest, about one thousand, were expected there in the afternoon. The following is a general account of the conduct and proceedings of the rebels during their slay at Derby, which may be depended upon for fact. \" Derby, Dec. 12th. The chief business of late, amongst all ranks of people here, and in our neighbourhood, has been concerning the progress the rebels have made in England since their first step into it, little imagining they would have advanced so near the metropolis of this king dom, as the capital of our county ; though for several days before they approached near us, we were not without our fears, and had proper persons constantly out to watch and bring us an ac count of their motions. His Grace the Duke of Devonshire (who has been indefatigable in his care for the preservation of his county) left Chatsworth about a fortnight ago, with the Marquis of Hartington, his eldest son, and came to the George Inn here, where they continued some days, waiting the event, and to concert the most proper measures for the safety of the public at a time of so much danger. We had also in town near six hundred men lately raised by a subscription of the gentlemen of this town and county, besides above one hundred and twenty raised by his Grace, and kept at his own expense ; these were reviewed by his Grace, &c. on Tuesday the 3rd instant ; and went through their exercise to the great satisfaction of all present ; his Grace also reviewed two or three other companies then in the field ; and we were then all in high spirits, by some tidings just received that the Duke of Cumberland's army was near the rebels, and 'twas expected a battle would ensue the next day. But alas ! how soon were we thrown into the ut most confusion, on hearing about an hour after, of the approach of the vanguard of the rebels to wards Ashbourn : the hurry was also much increased by the number of soldiers and their imme diate orders to march out of town, and nothing but distraction was to be read in every counte nance. The best part of the effects and valuables had been sent away or secreted some days be fore, and most of the principal gentlemen and tradesmen with their wives and children were re tiring as fast as possible. About four or five o'clock the same evening all the soldiers were drawn up in the Market-place, and stood under arms a considerable time, when they were ordered again to their quarters to refresh themselves : and about seven the same evening Captain Lowe of Haz zlewood, marched into town, at the head of a company of brave men. About ten the drums beat to arms, and being again drawn up, they all marched off by torch-light towards Nottingham, headed by his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, &c. The next morning (Wednesday) about eleven o'clock two of the rebels' vanguard rode into the town, and at their entrance gave a specimen of what we were to expect from such villains, by seizing a very good horse belonging to young Mr. Stamford; after which they rode up to the George, and there enquiring for the magistrates de manded billets for 9000 men or more. In a short time after the vanguard rode into the town, consisting of about thirty men, cloathed in blue, faced with red, most of 'em had a scarlet waist coat with gold lace, and being likely men made a good appearance. They were drawn up in the market-place, and sat on horseback two or three hours : at the same time the bells were rung, and several bonfires made, to prevent any resentment from 'em, that might ensue on our showing a dislike of their coming among us. About three i^giJie afternoon Lord Elcho with the life"], [449, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 421 guards, and many of their chiefs, also arrived on horseback, to the number of about one hundred and fifty, most of 'em cloathed as above ; these made a fine show, being the flower of their Soon after their main body also marched into town in tolerable order, six or eight abreast about eight standards, most of them white flags and a red cross. They had several bagpi who play'd as they marched along; and appeared in general to answer the description we hl've long had of them ; viz't. most of their main body a parcel of shabby, lousy, pittiful looking fel. lows, mixed up with old men and boys ; dressed in dirty plaids, and as dirty shirts, without breeches, and wore their stockings made of plaid, not much above half way up their Ws and some without shoes or next to none, and numbers of them so fatigued with their long march th t they really commanded our pity more than our fear. Whilst the market-place was filled' with them, they ordered their pretended Prince before he arrived, to be publicly proclaimed which accordingly done by the common cry er : they then insisted upon the magistrates appearino- in theh- gowns, but being told they had sent them out of the town, were content to have that ceremon excused. Their Prince (as they called him) did not arrive till the dusk ofthe evening; he walk ed on foot, being attended by a great body of his men, who conducted him to his lod'o._igS (the Lord Exeter's) where he had guards placed all round his house. Every house allmost b th' time was pretty well filled (tho' they kept driving in till ten or eleven at night) and we tho*. we should have never seen the last of them. The Duke of Athol had his lodoings at Th Gisborne's, esq. ; the Duke of Perth at Mr. Rivett's ; Lord Elcho at Mr. Storer's \u25a0 Lord G Murray at Mr Heathcote's ; Lord Pitsligo at Mr. Meynell's; Old Gordon of Glenbucket at\u00b0llr Alderman Smith's ; Lord Nairn at Mr. John Bingham's ; Lady Ogilvie, Mrs. Murray 1 other persons of distinction at Mr. Francey's : and their other chiefs and great officers were 1 1 1 at the best gentlemen's houses. Many common ordinary houses, both public and nriv t h 1 forty or fifty men each, and some gentlemen near one hundred. At their comino- in th generally treated with bread, cheese, beer and ale, whilest all hands were aloft getting- their pers ready ; after supper, being weary with their long march, they went to rest, many of them upon straw and others in beds. Being refreshed with a night's rest they were very alert th day, running about from one shop to another, to buy or rather steal, tradesmen's goods \" '. gloves, buckles, powder flasks, buttons, handkerchiefs, shoes, &c. and the town being filled with them, look'd like some fair in the Highlands: nothing was more common for them if thev lib 1 a person's shoes better than their own, to demand them off their feet, and not to give them an thing, or however what they pleas'd for 'em. The longer they stayed the more insolent and out- rageous they grew, demanding every thing by threats, drawn swords, and pistols clapp'd to the breast of many persons, not only by common men, but their officers ; so that several persons were obliged to abscond to preserve their lives. They appointed prayers to be read about six this evening at the great church, which was accordingly performed by one of their priests. They or- der'd the cryer to make public proclamation about the town for all persons that paid any excise to pay what was due by five o'clock the same evening, on pain of military execution ; by which means they collected a considerable sum of money. They also demanded what money the gen- tlemen had lately subscribed and paid, towards raising men in this town and county, which many gentlemen were obliged to pay. They also made a demand of \u00a3 100. upon the post-office and afterwards insisted upon \u00a350. which not being comply 'd with, they took the post chaise along with them. They broke open closets, chests, boxes, &c. at several gentlemen's houses, took away all the guns, pistols, swords, and all other arms they could find, in every house : pilfered and stole linen, stockings, shoes, and almost any thing they laid their hands on. In short they com- mitted almost all manner of outrages, which were they to be particularized, would more than fill our paper. We esteem'd them very civil fellows who did not threaten us, but went away quietly without paying their quarters : and those that did pay it was so small 'twas scarce worth th' ac- cepting. They beat up for volunteers, offering five shillings advance and five guineas when they came to London, but met with very little success ; only two or three loose fellows enter'd who serv'd their master but a short time, two being taken the next day, viz't. one Cooke, a journey man blacksmith, who we hear is in Nottingham jail : the other is one Sparks of this town, who"], [450, "422 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER was taken plundering at Squire Meynell' s, at Bradley, and brought here last Saturday night : and being examined before our Justices, was the same night committed to jail ; when they were taking him thither the populace shew'd so just an abhorrence of his actions, that it was thought they would have ty'd him up, before they could have got him into custody. The other is Hewitt, a butcher, who, we hear, is still with them. These and such fellows it is thought were our greatest enemies, by informing the rebels of many particulars concerning the gentlemen in this town and neigh bourhood. Early on Friday morning their drums beat to arms, and their bagpipers play'd about the town ; no one then knowing their route, but most people imagined they would march to Loughborough for London, their advanced guard having secured the pass at Swarkstone bridge. However we were soon undeceived by their precipitate retreat the same road they came, march ing off about seven o'clock in the morning. The reason for their return back was not known, but thought to proceed from their fear of being surprised by the Duke of Cumberland's army : their chiefs seeming much confused, and all in a great hurry : many of their men left their horses, swords, pistols, targets, shot, powder, bullets and other odd tilings behind them where they quar tered : a plain proof of their confusion. Their pretended Prince, mounted upon a black horse (said to be the brave Colonel Gardiner's) left his lodgings about nine o'clock, and riding across the market-place went through the Rotten-row, then turned down Sadler-gate towards Ashbourn, preceded and followed by the main body of his army. We were rid of them all (except a few stragglers) by eleven o'clock. Their hussars were a parcel of fierce and desperate ruffians, and were the last body that quitted the town. They rode out to the neighbouring villages, plundering most of the gentlemen's houses for arms and horses, of which they got a great number. The honest farmers hereabouts are all great sufferers, many of 'em having scarce a horse left, and others forced to go with their artillery. We had little or no market last Friday ; nor no divine service at any of the churches last Sunday. But as we are now pretty well settled again, hope we shall soon overcome our late misfortunes, and see all things roll again in their proper channel.\"* \" On their arrival at Derby, the rebel chiefs held a council of war ; but the only resolution they appeared to have formed, was that of levying money on the inhabitants. Having obtained a list of those persons who had subscribed for the support of the lawful government, they obliged them to pay an equal sum towards the support of the Pretender. They demanded the produce of the land-tax, excise, and post-office; the latter was refused them ; but from the two former, added to the contribution, they actually procured a sum little short of \u00a33000. Articles of dress were every where applied for, for they were very much wanted, as many of the misguided men were but half covered : some they procured with money, but when that was wanting, they did not hesitate to take them without payment. The conduct of the inhabitants towards their unwelcome visitors, was humble and obliging, and every care was taken to prevent insult and depredation : but all efforts to attain this end were ineffectual. On the second day, they seized on all kinds of proper- ty, and behaved in so outrageous a manner, that many ofthe more respectable inhabitants thought it prudent to conceal themselves. During their stay they beat up for volunteers, at five shillings advance, and five guineas, which was to be paid on their arrival in London : but they were joined by only three idle and unprincipled fellows ; Cook, a travelling journeyman blacksmith ; Edward Hewit, a butcher ; and James Sparks, a stocking-maker : men of degraded lives and sullied characters. \" On the evening of the second day, instead of marching forwards, as was expected, another council of war was privately held at the head quarters. Their situation by this time appeared critical; and many ofthe chiefs assumed a bold and commanding tone ; so warm at last did their debates grow, that they were overheard by Alderman Eaton, who constantly attended the Duke of Perth, and was waiting for him near the Prince's lodging. It was urged by the chiefs, that ; \u2014 ' they had followed their Prince with alacrity ; that their love for his cause, was equal to the hazard they ran. That the French had not fulfilled their engagements in sending the necessary supplies, nor in making a diversion in the West to draw the military attention. That the Eng- \u25a0 Derby Mercury."], [451, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 423 lish promises were still more delusive ; for they had been given to understand, as soon as the Prince's standard should be erected in England, the majority would run with eagerness to join it ; instead of which, they had raised only one slender regiment in their long march, which barely supplied their travelling losses. That the English were extremely loyal to the house of Stuart, when warmed by a good fire and good liquor; but the warmth of their fire, their liquor, and loyalty, evaporated together. That they were then in the centre of an enemy's country, with a handful of men : to retreat was dangerous ; but to proceed must be certain destruction.' \"* This progress of prince Charles from the borders of Scotland to the very centre of England, at the head of little more than seven thousand men ; and in the face of regular troops commanded by distinguished generals is a curious fact, nor is his retreat from Derby to the northern kino-dom less worthy of our attention. That his friends were numerous in many parts of England there can be no doubt, and had he been accompanied by sufficient force to warrant any just expectation of his ultimate success, his partisans would have shown themselves, and thousands would have flocked to his standard. The period for this invasion was well selected, as we have before ob served. The British cabinet was devoid of men of talent or public principle, and, since the resig nation of Sir Robert Walpole, one administration had rapidly followed another in the possession or distribution of the lucrative offices of the state, while the affairs of the nation were marked by defeat abroad and by distress and discontent at home. The people were, however, reluctant to add to their other miseries the evils of civil war, and many even of the warmest Jacobites, whose fathers had seen the days of Charles II. were unwilling to expose the nation to the tyranny of an unconditional restoration. Nor was public discontent, though excited by taxes heavier than any previously known, sufficient to conceal the dangers of a violent revolution. Certain important constitutional principles had been acknowledged in the settlement of the crown on the Bruns wick family. The liberties acquired by that settlement had certainly not yet been enjoyed, but the people gladly flattered themselves that those liberties were only suspended until their founda tion should be rendered secure. On his arrival at Derby, the young Pretender and his Scottish friends had more reason to con- gratulate themselves on their unassailed intrepidity than on their ultimate prospect of success. He had passed through a district which even at the present day abounds in papists, and which was not then, as it is now, the seat of wealthy manufacturers, enterprising commerce, and well- informed artisans. Liverpool and Manchester did not then rival the metropolis in activity, in- telligence and numbers. Still he was not strengthened, though he was not opposed, where he undoubtedly expected to be joined by multitudes. That Marshal Wade was not already upon his rear, and that the Duke of Cumberland, who was no farther off than Coventry, should have left him to deliberate whether he ought to advance from Derby towards London, or retreat by the road he had advanced, are circumstances not favourable either to the generalship of these two commanders, or to the decision and intelligence of the cabinet. His situation at Derby had manifestly become desperate, but his own personal resolution was little abated, and could he have persuaded the Scottish chiefs around him, that a victory over the royal Duke would have been certain of indu- cing his English adherents to rise in his favour, he would not have hesitated to make the attempt. Perhaps a general who had proceeded so far, and who had so great a stake at issue, ought to have risked an engagement ; but mistrust and dissension had arisen among the Highland chieftains, whose followers, as well as themselves, were impatient ofthe subordination necessarjr to the suc cess of a distant expedition. But what chiefly persuaded the young Prince that to retreat would not appear an abandonment of his purpose was the intelligence that his friends in Scotland had raised forces consisting of ten or twelve thousand men, under Lord John Drummond, who would maintain him in the posses sion of that kingdom, while the expedition which the French were preparing at Dunkirk and Calais would be ready for the invasion of the southern coasts of England early in the spring. This news had influence with the council held at Exeter-house, Derby; though still Lord Nairn * Hut ton's Derby."], [452, "HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 424 and the Prince himself insisted upon proceeding towards London, or risking an immediate battle. These bold propositions were overruled, and the retreat began on the 6th of December, early in the morning. Some movements were actually made for the march towards London : a part of the advanced guard, accompanied by some foragers, advanced southward. At Swarkeston bridge, their commanding officer enquired what towns or villages lay in that direction, and being inform ed of the situation of Melbourn, he said that two thousand troops would take up their quarters there that evening. This being communicated to the inhabitants of Melbourn, they immediately began to provide victuals for their expected visitors, but were not sorry that they did not keep their appointment It is surprising that a retreat in the midst of winter and in the vicinity of two considerable armies, should have been successful. The Duke of Cumberland, who was encamped at Meriden common, between Coventry and Birmingham, despatched his cavalry in pursuit of the rebels, while Marshal Wade, who had arrived on his tardy march through Yorkshire as far as Wakefield, when he heard that the enemy had reached Wigan on their return to Scotland, sent General Oglethorpe with the light horse and dragoons, to join the cavalry from Meriden, while he march ed back to his winter quarters at Newcastle. These troops of horse speedily overtook the rear of the rebels, and several skirmishes ensued, but the pursuit was continually repressed, and the re treating army continued to gain ground upon their adversaries, without sustaining any consider able loss, or being obliged to relinquish a single piece of their small train of artillery. In vain were the bridges broken down, and the militia called out to intercept their march. The retreat continued to be conducted with a compactness and vigilance that completely foiled every assault. At the village of Clifton, near Penrith, on the border of Cumberland, their rear-guard, consisting of the Macpherson clan, under the command of Lord John Murray, was fiercely attacked by two regiments of cavalry, who, dismounting their horses, lay concealed along the hedges that skirted the road. The broad swords of the Highlanders prevailed, and, after a sharp conflict, the dra- goons fled. The young Pretender pushed on his forces to Carlisle, which he entered on the 19th of December, having in thirteen days of mid-winter effected so signal and so unaccountable a re- treat of more than a hundred and eighty miles, that some historians have supposed that it was connived at by the government. Having re-enforced the garrison of Carlisle and left in that city such of his English adherents as were unwilling to cross the borders into Scotland, the young prince led his Scottish followers into their native land. Two days after his leaving Carlisle, that city was invested by the Duke of Cumberland, at the head of his whole army. The garrison held out for five days, and then offered to surrender upon terms. The Duke of Richmond held a conference with them, but whatever terms were agreed upon, it is certain that the garrison, to the number of four hundred men, were imprisoned in various English jails. The Duke of Cumberland returned to London, while the young Pretender advanced to Glas gow, which he laid under severe contribution, and being considerably re-enforced he took several towns, and seemed to have acquired a preponderating influence throughout the greater part of Scotland. In these circumstances he attempted the siege of Stirling castle, and gained a complete victory over the English general Hawley, who, at the head of a very considerable force of cavalry and infantry, attempted the relief of that place. This battle was fought near Falkirk, and the English tents and artillery fell into the hands of the enemy. It was now time for the British government, the administration of which had been completely changed during the winter, to act with more decision. Fourteen battalions of infantry, two regiments of dragoons and twelve hundred loyal Highlanders from Argyleshire, were placed under the Duke of Cumber land, who, on the last day of January, 174-6, proceeded to Edinburgh, and marching against the enemy, compelled the Pretender to retreat with precipitation across the Forth. Still the rebels, as they retired towards the Highlands, gained strength: they took Inverness, which their prince made his head quarters; became masters of fort Augustus, and at Keith defeated a detachment of horse which had been despatched from the main army to annoy them. Prince Charles then resolved to attack the royal Duke, who had advanced to Aberdeen, but he found"], [453, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 425 that the Highland chieftains could not be brought to unite in so important a step, and they still believed that re-enforcements from France would soon enable them to take the field with better hope of success. Affairs remained in this state until the month of April, when the young Pretender, encour aged by some partial successes, formed a design of surprising the Duke of Cumberland's army at Aberdeen, and advanced from Inverness to Culloden. The Duke had encamped at Nairn, nine miles from Culloden. The rebel force, impatient of delay, without taking time to recruit their strength, moved on by night, with the intention of surrounding and attacking the royal army before day-break. Unable from fatigue and the obstacles of a mountainous road to make the progress they expected, Charles was compelled by the chieftains to return to Culloden, and many of the undisciplined Highlanders dispersed themselves around the spot in search of provisions, while others, completely exhausted, sank to sleep upon the ground. The sun had scarcely ap peared above the horizon, when intelligence was brought that the royal forces might be seen from the hills slowly approaching, with a large train of artillery. The stragglers were instantly called in, and the clans, formed in thirteen divisions, stood ready to receive the attack of their foes. It was one o'clock in the afternoon before the Duke of Cumberland drew up his line of battle, and opened a destructive fire of artillery upon the enemy. The conflict was severe but of short du ration. The Highlanders charged with their usual impetuosity, and threw the left wing of the royal army into disorder, but were themselves charged by the dragoons and put to flight. \" In less than thirty minutes,\" says an historian,* \" they were totally defeated, and the field covered with the slain. The road as far as Inverness was strewed with dead bodies ; and a great number of people, who, from motives of curiosity, had come to see the battle, were sacrificed to the un distinguishing vengeance of the victors.\" The young Pretender having witnessed the destruction of his hopes rode from the field, attend ed by the Duke of Perth, Lord Elcho, and a few horsemen. To have taken refuge in the dwell ings of any of his principal adherents would have been certain destruction both to them and him self; he therefore put on a mean disguise, and sought safety among the rocks and caverns ofthe coast. He sometimes obtained temporary protection among the Western Islands, and frequently traversed the mountains and moors as a peasant, uncertain of food or of a place of repose, and was fearful even of speaking, lest his foreign accent should betray him. In his distress he was obli ged to confide his secret to more than fifty persons in the various conditions of life, all of whom well knew that a price of thirty thousand pounds was set upon his head. At length, on the 20th of September, a privateer, hired at St. Malo for the purpose, ran into Lochnanach, near the place where the young adventurer had landed thirteen months before. In this the Prince, with the two Camerons of Lochiel, and a few other adherents embarked, and passing unobserved through a British squadron, arrived safely at Roseau near Morlaix, in Britanny. This rebellion, which, by the folly and weakness of the government, had been permitted to disturb the minds and the affairs of men for so long a period, was followed by that vindictive spirit which actuates those who have neither prudence in danger nor magnanimity in success. The battle of Culloden led the way to a series of sanguinary barbarities, while numbers suffered under the forms of justice by the halter and the axe. This was the more lamented, because, it was plain that, by moderate exertion, the enterprize of the young adventurer might have been suppressed at the very moment of his landing ; nor would his audacity have been encouraged to attempt such an invasion, had the people been ruled according to the principles established at the Revolution. Many causes originating in the mistaken policy of the government had rendered the people discontented. The expensive wars maintained by taxes of the most odious character irri tated men's minds, but still there was no disposition to seek refuge in the arbitrary principles and obstinate bigotry ofthe Stuart family, much less to add to their grievances the calamities of civil war. The people generally looked to their representatives in parliament for relief, and had those representatives acted with firmness and honesty, the favourers of the Pretender would have been * Smollett's Continuation, George II. chap. 2. 3 i"], [454, "426 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER totally without a pretence by which they might flatter him with the slightest hope of success. It had long been felt throughout the country that placemen and pensioners, who were for the most part merely tools of the court, enjoying seats in the House of Commons, destroyed the indepen dence of parliament ; and at Derby, in August, 1740, during the summer assizes, an address was presented under the auspices of the high sheriff and grand jury to the county members. It was thus expressed : \"To the Right Honourable the Lord Charles Cavendish and Sir Nathaniel Curzon, bart. Rep resentatives of the County of Derby in parliament, \" We, the High Sheriff, Grand- Jury, Gentlemen, Clergy and Freeholders of the County of Derby, take this opportunity of expressing our concern that all endeavours for obtaining a Bill for reducing and limiting the number of placemen in the House of Commons, have hitherto proved fruitless ; We, therefore, recommend to you, and insist vpon it, that you use your utmost endeavours in the ensuing session of parliament, to promote a Bill for that purpose, which we think absolutely necessary for the securing^ the independency of Parliament, and preserving our liberties and ancient constitution.\" We have given this remarkable address \"in ijiis place tp show that the want of confidence in parliament paved the way for the Pretender's otherwise^unrtiarrantable expectations. A few years after the presentation of this unavailing address, the young heir of the Stuart name and expecta tions landed in Scotland and marched without impediment to Derby. The following is an exact account of the rebels as they mere quartered in the various parishes. Parish. First night. Second night.

Arriving at Derby in the evening ofthe second day from the Duke of Cumberland, he was stop ped by the guard attending the artillery on Nuns'-Green (which consisted of thirteen pieces) and being suspected as a spy, was closely confined in the house of Lord Exeter. The next morning, before it was light, when the main body was leaving the town, he leaped from a window, six yards high, into the garden. Attempting to pass a spiked part of the wall at the end of it, he fell into the river Derwent, but swam to some steps in an adjoining garden. Thinking himself not safe in this situation, he took off all his clothes, and left them with a gold watch and some money, which soon fell into the hands of the rebels. He then plunged again into the river, and followed its course, four miles, to Alvaston : in his way thither frequently swimming across it. When he came to the village, he took refuge in a farm house, where, after the surprise of the family had subsided, he met with the utmost care and attention. After having procured some clothes at another house, he escaped to Nottingham, and the day following passed through Derby on his way to his friends in Manchester.\" 1746, June 2nd.

The humble address of the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, Town Clerk, Brethren, and Capital Burgesses of your Majesty's ancient Borough of Derby in the County of Derby, in Common Council assembled. Most Gracious Sovereign, We your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, humbly beg leave to congratulate your Majesty, upon the late important success of your Majesty's forces, commanded by his Royal"], [455, "427 OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. Highness the Duke (of Cumberland) and animated by his great prudence and courage, against the most wicked and unnatural rebellion designed to subvert our happy Constitution in Church and State, in order to introduce popery and arbitrary power. This victory is never to be effaced from our memories, which (through God's providence) has wonderfully brought back to us, the fruition of those real and inestimable blessings, of our Reli gion, Laws and Libertys, so much of late endangered by the parricides and invaders of your Majesty's most lawful and rightful dominions in favour of a popish and long abjured Pretender. \u2014 We of this Borough are the more sensible of this blessing, because the enemies of your Majes ty's kingdom and government made this place their last scene of action before their return into Scotland, and inexpressible were the horrors and confusion they brought hither, attended in many instances with violent and open acts of rapine and plunder. May your Majesty, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, with a continuance of descendants, from your Majesty's own Royal family, always reign and live triumphant and victorious over rebellious subjects and their abettors, and hand down to us and our posterity the blessings we now enjoy, to the end of time.

In the year 1747 a murrain or distemper appeared among the cattle of this and the neighbour ing counties, and many precautions were taken against the contagion of such a calamity. This was to be expected, but we confess that we were somewhat surprised at finding it laid hold on as a reason for suppressing the annual game of foot-ball on the Shrove-tide of that year. A procla mation, signed Humphrey Booth, esq. mayor, is to be found in the Derby Mercury of the 27th of February, 1747, stating that \"the magistrates have had notice that the football-playing on the 3rd of March ensuing, has been notified and proclaimed in towns and counties adjacent, they therefore direct and order, that no riotous or tumultuous meeting of any persons (and more espe cially of foreigners at this unhappy time of contagion amongst horned cattle J do appear at the time and for the purpose aforesaid, in the said borough, on pain of being prosecuted for the same.' This game of foot-ball, which as it is played in the borough of Derby, should rather be called hand-ball, is undoubtedly of very great antiquity ; and probably was instituted, like the games ot the Romans, to commemorate some event, the incidents of which are now wholly forgotten. The magistrates have frequently endeavoured to suppress this game, which is sometimes attended with tumult, but there still exists an attachment to it which is nourished by the remembrances of the old, as well as the ardour of the young. Respectable tradesmen and their sons do not now join in the sport as they did not only some hundred years ago, but even at the date of the above pro clamation. In October, during the same year, the justices ofthe peace, at a special session, held at the King's Head, received an account relative to the extent of the distemper among the cattle in that part of the hundred of Repton and Gresley south of the Trent, when it appeared, that the number of infected were 659 died 290 killed 128 recovered 241 In 1747 the Duke of Newcastle and his brother, Mr. Pelham, by whose counsels the affairs of the country had been for some time conducted, resolved to dissolve a parliament, which, urged by the complaints and petitions of the people, had indicated a desire to look more attentively than they had done into the public expenditure. This disposition has been frequently observed to manifest itself in septennial parliaments about the fifth year of their legislative existence, and is in itself a strong argument against parliaments being elected for a term of years, which keeps the representatives so long independent of the constituent body. Influenced by the movements among the members of the House of Commons, the administration actually disbanded or reduced"], [456, "428 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER some regiments of the life-guards and cavalry, and effected a saving of about seventy thousand pounds per annum, but this only served to inspirit the members, who, at this late hour of their parliamentary labours, wished to win golden opinions of the people, to proceed in their demands. Accordingly the ministry thought proper to dissolve a parliament which was endeavouring to make itself popular, and call one which would have time to look to the wants of the court before it should find it imperative to think about the wants of the people. The parliament was dissolved on the 17th of June. A contested election for the borough of Derby ensued about the latter end ofthe same month. Lord Viscount Duncannon and the Hon. John Stanhope, were opposed by German Pole, esq. A coalition was formed between the two former candidates, who polled 400 votes each, while Mr. Pole, who perceived his success to be hopeless, withdrew from the contest at the close ofthe first day, having then obtained 251 votes. The new parliament' was completely ministerial. The opposition was silenced and the Earl of Chesterfield resigned the office of secretary of state. The effect of this was seen in an election which, in the December of the ensuing year, took place in Derby. The contest was between Mr. Stanhope and Thomas Rivett, esq.* a highly respectable inhabitant of this town. \" On this occa sion,\" says the Derby Mercury, \" there was a great appearance of gentlemen of distinction and fortune, and of great worth and honour.\" The contest began on Monday morning and termina ted on the evening of the ensuing day. The concourse of people was immense, but the whole was carried on with good order and tranquillity. Mr. Rivett obtained a majority of 71 ; the votes being, for Mr. Rivett 382; for Mr. Stanhope 811. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, inglorious as it was, terminated a war of which the nation had long been weary, and the announcement of it was received with rejoicings in every part of the kingdom. The Derby Mercury of April 28, 1749, contains the following paragraph; \"Tuesday last being the day appointed for a general thanksgiving for the peace lately concluded at Aix-la- Chapelle, the morning was ushered in with ringing of bells, &c. At ten the mayor and the cor poration with a numerous attendance of gentlemen ofthe town, preceded by a party ofthe Earl of Crauford's regiment of Scotch greys under arms, and the town music, went to church, where an excellent sermon was preached, suitable to the occasion, by the Rev. Mr. Winter. They were attended back from the church to the Town Hall, by the body of woolcombers, preceded by a band of music, consisting of a trumpet, French-horn, hautboy, bass-viol and three violins, who walked in the following order. 1. The shepherd, with his crook, bag and bottle, carrying a fleece of wool. 2. The captain, carrying a gun. 3. The orator, attended by two pages. 4. One representing Bishop Blaize, with a mitre upon his head, attended by four pages with white wands. 5. The masters in wool wigs and sashes. 6. One carrying a large flag neatly made of wool of divers colours. 7. The journeymen two and two, in their shirts, with wool wigs and sashes. Who (all these) made a very grand appearance. From thence (the Town Hall) the combers made a handsome cavalcade on horseback round the town, in the same order. In the evening the corporation with the military officers and the principal gentlemen and tradesmen in the town, met at a large bonfire before the Town Hall (which was finally illuminated, as were all the Market place and town in general) where the healths of his Majesty, &c. were drank, under a general discharge of small arms from the troops, &c. An entertainment at the George Inn followed. 1817- This year was remarkable in the annals of Derby for the trial and execution of three unhappy men, who, notwithstanding their station in society, which was sufficiently remote from the usual paths of ambition, were accused and convicted ofthe crime of levying war against the king, and of seeking to subvert the state. At that period the distress of the labouring classes * This gentleman died in 1763, and a monumental slab was by his widow placed to his memory on the south wall of All Saints' church. His daughter Sarah was married to Sir John Eardley Wilmot, Lord Chief Justice of the Com mon Pleas."], [457, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 429 was severe, and the majority of the nation looked in vain to the government for some reduction of the taxes that pressed heavily upon industry. This indifference of the administration to the wants of the people, increased the popular cry for parliamentary Reform and a change in the coun cils ofthe Prince Regent. As the constitutional appeals to the king and the parliament by pe titions could not be made punishable, the suffering public was watched and instigated by spies and informers, until some over-heated and ignorant people, in various parts of the country, in volved themselves in designs of a treasonable character, but so extravagant and absurd that they seemed to be rather a burlesque upon treason than treason itself. The policy of the government was to quiet the people by what they called \" making examples ;\" they hoped to silence the de mand for Reform by executions for high treason. Of the mighty rebellion, at the head of which was the redoubtable Jeremiah Brandreth, we are unable to trace the origin. The first that we hear of him is, that on the morning of the 8th of June, 1817, this man was at a public house in Pentrich, called the White Horse, under the name ofthe Nottingham Captain, with a map or chart in his hand, and talking to a party of poor la bourers about the necessity of overturning the government ; and this in the presence of two per sons whom he knew to be constables, one of whom said, on the trial, that he looked upon it all as foolish talk. The speech with which Brandreth addressed his followers was in verse \" Every man his skill must try ; He must turn out and not deny. No bloody soldiers must we dread : We must turn out and fight for bread. The time is come, you plain must see, The government opposed must be !\" To this, Brandreth added the injunction that \" every village should kill its own vermin.\" The military stratagems of the party were on a level with their language. \" In the first place,\" says a witness on the trial, \" it was proposed that the party should go to Winfield and set fire to a bundle of straw before the door of Colonel Halton, who is a magistrate of the county. Upon this fire being seen by the colonel, it was calculated that he would come out of his house, and, as soon as he appeared, it was determined to shoot him.\" At this meeting the plan of operations was de tailed. It was stated that an insurrection was immediately to take place, and that great numbers were expected from Sheffield and Chesterfield. The Butterley iron works were to be attacked, and the proprietor and managers slain. A list of the guns to be found in Pentrich, with the names of the owners; was read, and it was stated that forty pikes were secretly deposited in a stone quarry. After having armed themselves, the insurgents were to march to Nottingham, which town they were to take possession of, and receive a hundred guineas apiece. George Weight- man, who acted as aid-de-camp to Brandreth, was to proceed to Nottingham to learn the condi- tion of that place, which the leader seems to have supposed would already be in the hands of his friends. Money was collected in the room and the means of procuring a barrel of gunpowder were discussed: as for bullets, it was intimated that plenty of lead might be obtained by strip- ping off the roofs of churches in their march. The government would be overturned by insur- gents in London, and proper persons would be sent down to watch over the concerns of the poor and provide for their families. This meeting was held at noon, and continued in discussion about four hours. On the next evening, at half past eight, the insurgents assembled at an old barn, in one of Colonel Halton's fields. Their numbers do not appear to have been much more than a score. Brandreth, William Turner, George Weightman and a few others had guns ; two or three carried swords, but most ofthe party were armed with pikes, about nine feet in length. Brandreth, as sisted by William Turner, directed the march. The party separated on their march in two divi sions, and attacked several farm houses, demanding fire-arms, and compelling the farmers' ser vants or sons to join them. Their demand being refused at the farm house of Mrs. Hepworth, which stood on the west side of the highway, near Pentrich Hollow, Brandreth discharged his"], [458, "HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 430 gun at her servant, Robert Walters, through the kitchen window, and shot him dead by a wound in the shoulder. After the perpetration of this violent act, they proceeded down Pentrich lane, arranged in military order by Charles Swaine, who had belonged to the militia. At Pentrich they were joined by other parties of insurgents. Their numbers then amounted to about sixty. At Pentrich they attacked several houses, compelling the inmates to give up arms, and in some instances to join them. At a farm of Mr. Booth they took a pony from the stable, and George Weightman was despatched, upon it, to Nottingham to obtain intelligence of the proceedings there ; for it appears that many of them began to be alarmed at their own enterprize when they found it to be unsupported by so general a rise as they had been taught to expect. They next threatened the Butterley works with an attack. On their demanding arms, Mr. George Good win, one of the managers, told them of the folly of their conduct, and even rescued one or two who had been compelled to go with them ; he also seized William Weightman, who was encum bered with a load of bullets, more than eighty pounds in weight. Finding an attack on the But terley works impractical, they went to Codnor, where their numbers increased by parties from different quarters. Mr. Hole, whose house was attacked by them, and who was himself compelled to accompany them, stated on the trials which subsequently took place, that there were about two hundred insurgents assembled at Codnor, and that there were two other parties advancing to join them, the one consisting of about fifty, and the other of sixty or seventy men. At a public house, called the Glass-house, in Codnor, Brandreth called upon the landlord for refreshments, and while the party were supplied with ale, some divisions that had been sent out in the neigh bourhood, returned. The charge for refreshment amounted to twenty-eight shillings, which their captain undertook to pay. The whole party then marched to the Nottingham road, and near Langley Mills they met George Weightman returning from that town. When Weightman came up, Brandreth and several of the party, asked him, \" how they were going on at Nottingham ?\" To which he replied, \" that they were going on very well : that the soldiers would not come out of the barracks, and that the party led by Brandreth was to march forward.\" This intelligence did not, however, allay the apprehensions entertained by many of the party, and, though the body of insurgents moved onward to Eastwood, their numbers were continually diminishing by desertions. At Eastwood they were reconnoitred by Launcelot Rolleston, of Watnall, esq. who immediately procured the aid ofthe 15th hussars from Nottingham barracks, by whom the insurgents were pursued, and above thirty of them taken. The high sheriff (Thomas Hallowes, of Glapwell hall, esq.) with a party of yeomanry, took the Turners and several other insurgents, prisoners near Langley mills. The hussars were commanded by Captain Phillips, and the exer tions of Mr. Rolleston were ably aided by C. G. Mundy, esq. It may be imagined that the tidings of this insurrection created considerable alarm in the town of Derby. The Rev. Charles Stead Hope was mayor of the borough, and he acted with his usual promptitude and firmness ; assisted particularly by the aldermen Richard Leaper, and the late Thomas Lowe, esqrs. Under their orders, a company ofthe 95th regiment, under the command of Captain Hellerman, was on duty throughout the night of the 9th of June, and in the course of that night two troops of the Derbyshire yeomanry cavalry, under the command of Major Sir R. WTilmot, of Chaddesden, bart. arrived in the town. In consequence of the information received during the night, the Calke and Ashbourn troops were sent for; and these bodies of yeomanry, proceeded under the command of the gallant major towards Langley bridge. On the way they were joined by the Chesterfield troop, commanded by Captain Wright, who had on the preceding day advanced to Alfreton. Several of the principal insurgents were not apprehended until a few days before the summer assizes, appointed to be held in the County Hall, Derby, on the 26th July. Brandreth was taken on the 22nd by the Nottingham police, and lodged in Nottingham jail. George Weightman of Pentrich, and Isaac Ludlam, the elder, of South Winfield, were brought to Derby jail. The former was taken in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, and the latter near Uttoxeter. They were taken by Mr. S. Fletcher, Mr. William Booth, and Mr. W. Lister, inhabitants of Pentrich. At the assizes true bills of indictment were found by the grand jury against Thomas Bacon, Jeremiah"], [459, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 431 Brandreth, otherwise called John Coke, otherwise the Nottingham Captain, George Weightman, William Turner, Joseph Turner, otherwise called Manchester Turner, Isaac Ludlam, the elder, Isaac Ludlam, the younger, Samuel Ludlam, William Ludlam, Samuel Hunt, Robert Turner, Edward Turner, Charles Swaine, John Onion, the elder, John Me Kesswick, John Hill, Joseph Rawson, otherwise called Joseph Thorpe, Joseph Topham, German Buxton, Edward Moore, Josiah Godber, George Brassington, William Adams, William Hardwick, John Wright, Thomas Ensor, Joseph Savage, John Moore, William Weightman, Thomas Weightman, Joseph W'eight man, the younger, James Weightman, Thomas Bettison, Alexander Johnson, John Bacon, Joseph Weightman, the elder, James Barnes, Edward Haslam, John Horsley, Samuel Briddon, William Barker, William Elliott, James Taylor, Joseph Taylor, Benjamin Taylor, and Samuel Walters, otherwise called Samuel Dudley. These persons were committed on charges of high treason, stated to have been done on the night of the 9th of the preceding June. They were detained to take their trials at a special assize to be held in the ensuing October. Two mentioned in the list were not then in custody. They were subsequently lodged in the Derby county jail on the 17th of August, having been taken, after a very long pursuit and a de termined resistance, at St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire, by Henry Newton, an active borough officer of Derby. Those who recollect the arrangements of the old county hall, must be aware that some accom modation would be wanting for the special court on this extraordinary occasion, beyond what it usually afforded. The space at the entrance of the hall was formed into an extensive crown court, with the bench at the extremity of the pavement to the right hand. In front of the bench was a large table, for the convenience of the gentlemen of the bar and attorneys. Next to this was formed a spacious dock for the reception of the numerous prisoners. The jury box was situate to the right hand of the judge, with the faces of the jurymen opposite to the light from the windows. This is indeed an object that ought to be a primary one in all sessions and assize courts, and nothing is more to be reprobated, among the numerous defects of the new borough court at Derby, than the position of the jury-box, with the backs of the jurymen against the light, so that the accused persons are shut out from all possibility of recognizing them by their countenances. The rest of the court was fitted up with seats rising gradually above each other for the accommo dation of the public. The judges, Mr. Justice Abbot and Mr. Justice Holroyd entered the borough on Thursday, the 25th of September, attended by Thomas Hallowes, of Glapwell, esq. high sheriff, the mayor (the Rev. Charles Stead Hope) and a large concourse of gentry and other inhabitants of the town and county. The next day their Lordships took their seats on the bench, and the prisoners were brought into court in four separate divisions. They were informed by Mr. Justice Abbot, that \" the grand jury of the county having, at the last assizes, found true bills for high treason against them, they were to take their trials on the 15th and 16th ofthe ensuing month : that they would receive a copy of the indictment, lists of the witnesses for the prosecution and of the jury, ten days previous to their trials, and that the court was ready to assign them counsel.\" His Lordship also asked if they had employed solicitors for their defence, and was informed by Mr. Robert Bond, of Leicester, that himself and Mr. Thomas Wragg, of Belper, were solicitors for all the prisoners. John Cross, esq. and Thomas Denman, esq. barristers at law, were nominated their counsel. The court was then adjourned to the 15th of October. On the day appointed for the trials, the town of Derby exhibited, by the concourse of strangers which crowded the streets, a striking proof of the extensive nature of the interest which the fate of these unhappy men had excited. The charge of high treason against persons of their humble condition in society had filled the community with astonishment and alarm. The people looked at one another, and every expression implied a doubt of the actual criminality of a score or two of labourers, who stood accused of a design to overturn the government; and it was every where believed that the originators of a purpose, of which such agents could be nothing more than the dupes and victims, would be necessarily pointed out in the course of the legal proceedings. \" The prisoners,\" says a newspaper of that period, \" are, most of them, in the lowest situation in life,"], [460, "432 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER men without property and without influence, only one of them being, in dress and appearance, a wit above the situation of a working mechanic or a labouring man. Some of them appeared in court in smock frocks, and others evinced by their clothing, that they were the sons of poverty.\" The number of jurymen summoned on the occasion, were three hundred, and the witnesses on the part of the prosecution were no fewer than two hundred and eight. Such was the anxiety of the administration to give an air of importance to the trial of a few wretches, whom misery had rendered desperate, and who could not of themselves have conceived the design they had endea voured to execute. The judges named in the commission, were, the Chief Baron of his Majesty's court of Exche quer (Sir Richard Richards) Sir Robert Dallas, and Sir Charles Abbot, knights, Justices of the court of Common Pleas, and Sir George Sowley Holroyd, knt. one ofthe Justices ofthe court of King's Bench. The counsel retained for the crown were the Attorney and Solicitor General, Serjeants Vaughan and Copley, with the Barristers Clarke, Gurney, Reader, Reynolds, Richard son, and Balguy, jun. The grand jury consisted of persons of the highest rank and greatest opulence in the county: they were, Lord George Augustus Cavendish, Foreman. Honourable George Vernon, Aston Nicholas Moseley, esq.

Richard Arkwright, esq. Charles Hurt, esq. Joshua Jebb, esq. The trial of Brandreth continued until the 18th of October, and the circumstances elicited ac corded with the narrative we have above given. During the proceedings he had preserved a severe ferocity of countenance, but on the adjournment of the court, he turned extremely pale, as if the intensity of his resolution had given way to a sense of his awful situation. He made efforts, however, to resume his composure, and answered one or two important questions, \" which,\" says our authority, \" might well be called, in the language of Milton, a ghastly smile.\" On the same evening he wrote to his wife a letter remarkable for the rational, yet ardent piety of its diction. The trial of William Turner began on Monday, October 20, and terminated the next day. Isaac Ludlam, the elder, was next tried, and it was in defence of him, that Mr. Denman alluded to Brandreth, and made that celebrated quotation from the Corsair of Lord Byron.* George Weightman, who had acted as a sort of aid-de-camp to Brandreth, was the last that underwent a regular trial. He was a fine young man of a very florid complexion. On Saturday the 25th of October, the proceedings closed, the other prisoners being permitted to withdraw their plea of not guilty and throw themselves upon the mercy of the crown. The whole of the prisoners were then put to the bar, to receive sentence.

Sun-burnt his cheek \u2014 his forehead high and pale, The sable curls in wild profusion veil ; There breathe but few whose aspect could defy The full encounter of his searching eye ; \u2014 There was a laughing devil in his sneer, That raised emotions both of rage and fear ; And where his frown of hatred darkly fell, Hope withering fled \u2014 and Mercy sighed farewell ! His name appals the fiercest of his crew, And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue ; Still sways their souls with that commanding art That dazzles \u2014 leads \u2014 yet chills the vulgar heart. What is that spell, that thus his lawless train Confess and envy \u2014 yet oppose in vain? What should it be, that thus their faith can bind ? The power, the nerve, the magic of the mind ! Linked with success \u2014 assumed and kept with skill, That moulds another's weakness to his will \u2014 Wields with their hands \u2014 but still to these unknown, Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own."], [461, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 433 asked whether he had any reason to allege why sentence of death should not be passed upon him replied, \"Let me address you in the words of our Saviour \u2014 ' if it be possible let this cup pass from me, but not my will, but the Lord's be done.' \"* The other three who had been tried expressed a hope for the mercy of the court. The Lord Chief Baron then pronounced the awful sentence ofthe law. On the Sunday the warrant was received for the execution of Brandreth, Ludlam and Turner on the Friday following, and in this warrant the portion of the sentence that spake of quartering the quivering bodies was justly omitted : we do not live in times when the old barbarities of our feudal ancestors can be put in practice. We have not space to detail the particulars of the beha viour of these wretched men during the days that intervened before their execution ; and it will suffice to quote the following passage from the papers of that period. \"On mounting the scaffold Brandreth exclaimed, 'It's all Oliver and Castlereagh.'+ The cord by which he was to be suspended was tied too high, and on account of his shortness it became necessary to loosen it at the top to make it reach him. When his head was passed through it, and the knot placed behind the left ear, the rope being at the same time drawn moderately tight, the word was given for William Turner to be brought up ; he ascended the ladder with a faltering step, and on reaching the platform, called out with an air of wildness, ' This is all Oliver and the government, the Lord have mercy on my soul.' The chaplain at this moment came in front of these two, and prevented any further observations. The halter was then placed about Turner's neck, and he joined with the minister in prayer. The third sufferer, Isaac Ludlam, was now brought up the ladder, he prayed as he passed up, and while the rope was being placed about his neck, raised his voice in humble supplication to heaven in the following terms: \u2014 ' O Lord, forgive my sins, and receive my soul, and grant that I may meet all this great concourse of people in heaven. Bless the king of this nation, bless the people, bless all the people, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free ; yea, bless all, from the king upon his throne down to the meanest subject in the realm, and may this awful dispensation be made a blessing to thousands and tens of thousands. O Lord, receive my spirit.' The chaplain asked if he would listen to the prayer which he was proceeding to read to Brandreth and Turner, but Ludlam seemed not to hear him, and continued to repeat his former prayer. After a few moments, perceiving the chap- lain was reading, he stopped, and joined the others in their responses. When the minister had ceased to read, the three culprits joined with him in repeating the Lord's Prayer ; after which the re;', gentleman took his leave. The executioners put the caps on the heads of the unhappy men, and pulled them over their faces. Each of them exclaimed at this moment, ' Into thy hands, O God, I commit my spirit.' They continued to call on their Creator and Redeemer for mercy ; and Isaac Ludlam was once more giving utterance to the last part of the prayer above inserted, when, at twenty-five minutes before one, the bolt was drawn, and they were launched into eternity.\" 1831, Saturday evening, October 8. On this day, at about seven o'clock, an express sent by the proprietors of the Sun newspaper arrived in this town, with the information that the reform bill had been rejected by the house of Lords, on a vote for the second reading, by a majority of 1 QQ to 158. Their Lordships had continued in debate until six o'clock in the morning on the same day. The agitation of the whole country was very great, and we regret to say that circumstances took place in Derby that inflamed the people to acts of violence and riot. The expression of the public sentiment began by the ringing a funeral peal on the bells of St. Peter's and All Saints'. The first outrage committed was the breaking ofthe windows of Mr. Bemrose's house in the Market-place, where a petition against the reform bill had lain for signature. The mob then proceeded to the house of Mr. Eaton, near St. Mary's bridge, where they broke many windows and threatened him with vengeance for the part he had taken against the reform bill. That gentleman, with difficulty, escaped in disguise. The handsome residence of Henry Mozley, esq. in Friar-gate, was * The expression in the newspapers is, \" your Lordship's be done,\" but the strong natural sense and piety of Bran dreth would not have permitted him to have addressed the bench with so impious an allusion to the Deity. \u2022\"- Many ofthe spectators declare that the expression was, \"God bless you all, but Lord Castlereagh.\" 3 K"], [462, "434 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER next attacked by the increasing numbers of the rioters, and all the glass in the extensive front of the house was demolished. At the house of Mr. William Baker, a friend to the measure of re form, the crowd made a pause, and that gentleman, with much earnestness endeavoured to per suade them to desist from a course of destruction which could be of no benefit to the cause which they pretended to espouse. They cheered him and went on with other works of demolition. The houses of Thomas Cox, esq. and the Rev. Charles Stead Hope were assailed, and the front of the latter was in a short time rendered a spectacle of lamentable devastation. The mansion of Francis Mundy, of Markeaton, esq. was visited by them, and there many windows were demol ished, and in the grounds, the paling and the shrubs were torn up. On the return of this party to the borough, the houses of Mr. Hope and Mr. Eaton were again assailed, and that of Mr. Har rison in the Bridge-gate was seriously injured. The rioters then proceeded in a large body to Chaddesden, and attacked the seat of Sir Robert Wilmot, bart. where they committed immense depredations. On their return to Derby they renewed their assault on the house and shop of Mr. Bemrose, whose premises had indeed been the object on which several parties during the night had made repeated assaults. Other houses suffered at the same time from straggling par ties, among which we may notice those of Mr. Drewry, Mr. Johnson, surgeon, in Full-street, Mr. Abbott, and Mr. Winston. The alarming tumult of the preceding night induced C. M. Lowe, esq. the mayor, to call a meeting of the respectable inhabitants to consider what steps it was advisable to take. The sum mons was made unfortunately by the public crier on the Sunday morning, and the body of the town hall was soon filled by numbers of the party who committed the riots. A demand was instantly made that two persons who had been arrested on the preceding night by the police should be set at liberty. This was, of course, firmly refused, when a youth, about twenty years of age, cried out, \" let us go to the town jail and liberate them !\" He took the lead, and was followed by a large crowd. In front of the jail, a cast iron lamp post was pulled up, and the jail door was battered open. Twenty-three prisoners were set at liberty. The mob then proceeded to the county jail. There they were received with determined resistance, and a shot from a musket struck a youth named Garner, and wounded him so severely in the abdo men, that he expired the same evening. Three other persons were wounded. The mob then retreated, and were persuaded to disperse by J. Beaumont, of Barrow, esq. Sir Charles Col vile, knt. and Thomas Gisborne, esq. M. P. who addressed them from the carriage ofthe former gentleman. Their leaders, however, resolved to reassemble at half past six the same evening. In the afternoon of Sunday, a troop of the 1 5th hussars arrived from Nottingham, but the rioters assembled in the Market-place, and proceeded in separate bodies to Mrs. Harrison's house on Chester green. There they were guilty of the most wanton acts of destruction, and it was apparent that they had been joined by persons who had no object but plunder. On re-entering the borough, they demolished the street lamps and broke the windows of houses whose residents were warm reformers as well as those of others. The palisading of All Saints' church was wan tonly destroyed : the post office was attacked, and the mob, in a tumultuous manner, proceeded towards the Irongate. There the younger Mr. Haden, a gentleman of much estimation for his talent6 and pleasing manners, who had been previously indisposed, was thrust down, and in jured by the crowd. He died in the course of the night. The military, accompanied by the mayor, then began to act, and the mob dispersed gradually. On the Monday morning a requisition was signed requesting the mayor to call a meeting to take into consideration the propriety of addressing the King, beseeching his Majesty to retain his ministers for the purpose of carrying the reform bill. The meeting was not called, but hand-bills were dispersed announcing to the people that such an address to the King would be ready for signature. The mob, however, was no longer actuated by any political sentiment. They assem bled in the Market-place, in a tumultuous manner, without any apparent object of excitement, but displaying scenes of wanton riot- The few gentlemen who attempted to address them could not obtain a hearing, and when six market-stalls were partly erected to afford the means of sign ing the address, they were destroyed, and the broken pieces thrown about. It was time then to"], [463, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 435 have recourse to the military. The riot act was read, and the Market-place with the neighbour ing streets were instantly cleared by the hussars. During this, some shots were fired, and an in dustrious, peaceable man, named John Hicking, was shot at the door ofthe Greyhound Inn at the Market-head, where he was going for some ale to his dinner. Several persons were slight ly wounded by the sabres of the military. The streets and public houses were instantly cleared : all business was suspended, special constables were sworn in, and tranquillity was restored. The Burton troop of yeomanry having volunteered their services, arrived in the borough about eight o'clock, and the Radbourn troop also patrolled the roads in the vicinity of the town during the night. Nevertheless an attack was made, by a party of desperate fellows resolved on plunder, on the house of Mr. Haworth, in the Duffield road, who fled with great trepidation as soon as they heard of the approach of the military. The Leicestershire yeomanry, under the command of Adjutant Bowater, arrived in the town on Monday evening. On Tuesday the town was com pletely tranquil. The coroner's inquest on the persons who had unfortunately lost their lives during the tumult was expected with considerable interest. On the 11th of October the jury were sworn, and an inspection of the bodies took place, as a measure necessary before the interment of them, but the examination of witnesses was adjourned to the 13th and then to the 17th of the same month. The investigation occupied the greater part of three days, and the verdicts were various. The death of the youth, Garner, who was shot opposite to the county jail, was pronounced to be justifiable homicide, while that of the poor man, Hicking, who fell by a bullet from a soldier's carbine, which was manifestly intended for a perverse and riotous individual, was brought in acci dental death. Mr. Henry Haden, having been for some time subject to a disease in the pr\u00e6cor dium was considered to have died a natural death, accelerated without doubt by the pressure of the tumultuous mob. Many persons were arrested under suspicion of being concerned in breaking into the borough jail, and liberating the prisoners then in confinement. Their trials were at first appointed to be held before the Recorder, J. Balguy, jun. esq. at the next Epiphany session for the borough, but after an adjournment of that session for several weeks, it was determined to consign the accused persons to the general Spring assizes. The reasons for this postponement were probably that the prisoners might have a jury more impartial than any could be expected to be, who should be taken from among persons resident amid the scenes of confusion, and likewise that the trials at assize would be more impressive, and would be more capable of rendering the examples which it might be requisite, more general. On the 17th of March, 1832, the following eleven persons were charged before the Honourable Sir James Parke, knt. Chief Justice ofthe Common Pleas, and a jury from the northern parts of the county, with breaking into the jail of the borough of Derby, and liberating William Keeling a convicted felon, therein confined. William Hudson, aged 29 William Walters, aged 20 George Mosedale, aged 22 John Roome 20 Luke Needham 26 Samuel Kirk 20 21 Catherine Henrys 23 Thomas Roberts 29 John Hanson Francis Bamford 20 James Wardle 32 The trials commenced at a quarter past one on Saturday, and terminated with the acquittal of all the prisoners at the same hour on Sunday morning. Two of the prisoners who had been concerned in the riots were convicted and transported for sevens years each. One for stealing a pair of silver spectacles from the dwelling house of Mr. Haworth ; the other for stealing a book from Mrs. Harrison's. In the course of this historical sketch we have noticed several periods of the population and enlargement of the borough, so as to afford a general retrospective view of its gradual growth. At the present time it contains little less than twenty-four thousand inhabitants, resident in about four thousand eight hundred houses. The streets have been greatly improved, and additional"], [464, "436 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER streets have risen in every quarter, particularly in the Castle-fields, Nuns'-green, and the Nor- manton road. The Improvement Act, obtained in 1825, has been productive of many alterations tending to the health and convenience of the inhabitants. The Town Hall is an elegant new building, the exterior of which surpasses the interior, while the new interior of the County Hall, remarkable for the utility as well as beauty of its arrangements, remains in possession of its gro- tesque faijade, built in the style ofthe seventeenth century.The front ofthe new County Jail may be classed among the finest specimens of Doric architecture in the kingdom, but unfortunately it has been thought necessary, on account of the late riots, to rear a large round tower, more suited to the old feudal times, than the present era, on each side of this truly classical portico. There are several other new public buildings of recent date, among which we may mention the new church, dedicated to St. John, in Bridge-street, which is a beautiful specimen, on a small scale, of the Moorish architecture in Spain. The Market-place has been enlarged and improved, and the facilities of trade have been every where objects of attention. Public institutions for the encour- agement of science and education are almost daily increasing, and there are now two newspapers published in the borough. In addition to that noble establishment, the Infirmary, the medical wants of the poor find relief in a Dispensary, established upon a very admirable plan. Within a few years, coaches, or what are called flies, have been called for and set up, on account of the increasing intercourse of the community, while the old sedan-chair is retained only for the convey- ance of invalids. The social amusements of the theatre or concert-room, are probably not so well attended as they were when the town was much smaller ; and the oratorios triennially perform- ed for the benefit of the Infirmary, have latterly scarcely paid their expenses. In fact, as the comforts ofthe domestic circle increase, the recreations that were formerly sought for from pub- lic society every where diminish. There are now no public walks, such as Darley Grove and the Holmes afforded the inhabitants of the borough formerly ; and bowling-greens, the constant evening amusement of respectable tradesmen during the greater portion of the last century, are now but little encouraged. Scientific lectures succeed best when delivered at the Mechanics' In- stitution, and without supposing that the higher classes of society do not make use of the exten- sive means in their power of privately acquiring knowledge more perfectly in their libraries, we see in the open manner in which the humble classes come to the fountains of instruction, a strong proof of the enlargement of mind among the manufacturing operatives, and the handicraftsmen of the rising generation. The literary and philosophical institutions will be described under their proper appellatives, but we cannot here omit to mention as an eminent proof of the improving taste displayed to the honour of the borough, the Picture Gallery of Joseph Strutt, esq. which comprises many of the best paintings of ancient and modern times, and to which visitants obtain access with a facility worthy of the spirited liberality of the amiable and intelligent proprietor. The borough of Derby is divided into five parishes, named, St. Alkmund's, St. Michael's, All Saints', St. Werburgh's, and St. Peter's, to whom the churches are respectively dedicated. St. Alkmund's parish includes the chapelries of Darley Abbey, Little Eaton and Quorndon, and the township of Little Chester; St. Michael's includes the parochial chapelry of Alvaston; and St. Peter's includes the parochial chapelries of Boulton, Normanton, and Osmaston, and the hamlet of Litchurch. The following table gives the enumeration, with the returns of the number of in habitants in 1801, 1811, 1821 and 1831, the acreage and estimated annual value of the lands, mes suages and other buildings in each parish, chapelry or township."], [465, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 437 The borough of Derby contained in 1377, lay persons above 14 years of age, exclusive of pau pers, 1040.

The principal streets have re cently been improved upon Mc Adam's plan, and the footpaths are paved with stone or bricks. The houses are mostly built with red bricks which are made in the vicinity of the town. The pub lic buildings are generally built of durable stone, procured in the county. The town is abundant ly supplied with excellent water from Becket's well and other springs, and by the Water Company. Many new streets have been laid out during the last quarter of a century ; they are uniformly built, some on elevated and others on eligible sites, on the south, west, north and east ofthe town. The parishes that have most increased are St. Peter's, St. Werburgh's, and St. Alkmund's. The old town was built in an irregular manner, upon a peninsula formed by the junction of the Derwent and the Markeaton brook. From each stream the land rises to the centre and forms a ridge, upon which the churches of All Saints', St. Michael's and St. Alkmund's are built. The"], [471, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 443 land rises considerably to the south beyond the Markeaton brook, upon which St. Peter's and St. George's churches are erected. On the south-west bank of the same brook St. Werburgh's and St. John's churches are built on low sites. There are but few of the ancient houses now remaining. The most ancient thoroughfares or streets are called gates, as Friar-gate, Bridge-gate, St. Mary's gate, Iron-gate and Sadler-gate. The word gate implying in many old authors not so much the door- way or portal of any building, as the road or pathway leading to it. The principal streets or thoroughfares are the Friar-gate (in many parts twenty-four yards wide) Ashbourn road, Uttoxeter road, Bridge-street, Brook-street, Ford-street, St. Helen's-street, Bold-lane, St. Mary's-gate, Sad ler-gate, Curzon-street, Wardwick, Brook-side, Green-lane, St. Peter's-street, Babington-lane, Burton road, Normanton road, Osmaston road, London-street, Castle-street, Siddall's-lane, Mor ledge, Tenant-street, Market-place, Derwent-street, Full-street, Corn-market, Rotten-row, Iron gate, Queen-street, King-street, Duffield road, Kedleston road, Bridge-gate, Chester road, Not tingham road, Ford-lane and Erasmus-street. The whole of the streets in each parish will be found alphabetically arranged in the lists. The various approaches to the town have undergone considerable improvements within the last five years, and those from London, Birmingham, Ut toxeter and the north are much enlarged, and in a few years Derby will have on every side ex cellent roads and entrances. Notwithstanding much has been done to improve the thoroughfares, we may perhaps venture to suggest a few others to the notice of the public. Two lines of road from Derby might be greatly improved and shortened. The first is the road to Burton, which, instead of going up St. Peter's-street, Babington-lane, along the Burton road and through Littleover, might run north of Littleover hill, through the vale of Bramley brook, and enter the town through Curzon-street. This line would avoid the hills and save the distance of a mile. '1 he other is the road from Derby to Dumeld. This line might run through the vale of the Derwent, following its course, or take the line already made through Little Chester and Little Eaton. The latter only requires one mile of new road to be made from Little Eaton to Dumeld bridge, and it would be equally as near, and save the heavy hills at Bur ley and Allestree, which are on the present line. A more direct approach to the Market place from the east or Nottingham road, is much called for to obviate the circuitous route and the dangerous turns of the present road, from St. Mary's bridge by King and Queen-streets. Another chain or stone bridge should be thrown over the Derwent, and a direct road opened at the back of Ford-street, immediately on to the Nottingham and Little Chester roads, from the market-place. This new line would save a distance of nearly half a mile, and the danger of the sharp turns al ready alluded to. Jjy taking down one side of the Iron-gate, where the street is so narrow, and by removing th|^uildings standing between the Rotten-row and the Market-place, comprising the Piazzas^hambles and Rotten-row, the town would be much improved, the Market-place enlarjjpd-'lmd beautified and the public benefited. The manor or lordship of Derby is of considerable extent. It is bounded on the north by Lit tle Chester, Darley Abbey, and Allestree ; on the west, by Markeaton ; on the south-west, by Mickleover and Littleover; on the south, by Normanton and Osmaston; on the south-east, by Alvaston and Boulton ; and, on the east, by Chaddesden. It is nearly circular, the diameter being about two miles, and the land, according to the survey of Mr. Swanwiek, is 1810 acres. The ground occupied by streets, or what is particularly understood by the town, occupies about 300 acres in the centre of this circle. At the time when Mr. Hutton wrote (1790) its extent was not more than a third part of its present acreage. The Corporation are the lords of the manor. The corporation lands are enjoyed by the burgesses in common, under particular regulations. They are the Siddalls and the Old Meadows, of which the hay-grass is let on a long lease to Messrs. Cox, who are obliged to clear the land by the 25th of June; after which any burgess has a right to turn in his cattle, until the ensuing Lady-day : in the Holmes, the Chequer closes, Cowsley field and the new Pasture, the burgesses have the right of pasture throughout the year, on the payment of 26s. for each cow or horse. All these lay eastward of the town. Bradshaw Hayes, containing about 1-1 acres, to the south, was sold by the corporation about twenty-three years ago, to the governors of the Infirmary, for .\u00a3200. per acre. The Castle fields were undoubt-"], [472, "444 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER edly among the lands bestowed by queen Mary's grant upon the corporation, and it is not very clear whether that land came into the possession ofthe Borough family by purchase or otherwise, during the period that Isaac Borough, esq. was recorder of the town, early in the reign of George II. It was sold in 1822 by the present Thomas Borough, esq. for the sum of \u00a322,000. Nuns' green, situate to the west, and held by the corporation, was disposed of under two acts of parliament obtained in 1768 and 1792. An act was passed \" for selling part of a green called Nuns' Green, in the borough of Derby, and for applying the money arising from the sale thereof in the improvement of the remaining part of the said green,\" the preamble of which recites, \" Whereas there is within the borough of Derby a certain piece of ground called Nuns' Green, containing by estimation forty-eight acres or thereabouts, on which the freeholders, owners, and occupiers of messuages, lands, and tenements, and burgesses within the said borough, have right of common : and whereas several small buildings have lately been erected thereupon and great damage has been done to the said green by persons digging gravel thereout, to the no small detri ment and loss ofthe said freeholders, owners, occupiers, and burgesses having right of common thereon, as well as to the prejudice of the health of the inhabitants of the said borough, by reason of the stagnated water and other nuisances : and whereas the said borough is by the increase of trade become very populous, and there is a real want of more dwelling houses for the inhabitants : and whereas if the said nuisances and incroachments on the said green were removed and pre vented, and power given to sell part thereof for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses and buildings thereon, and the money arising from such sale were applied in removing the said nui sances and incroachments, and in improving the said green, it would greatly tend to the benefit and advantage of the said freeholders, owners, occupiers, and burgesses, as well as ofthe other inhabitants of the said borough ; May it therefore please your Majesty, That it may be enacted : and be it enacted, by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Par liament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that the Mayor and Recorder of the bo rough of Derby for the time being, the Right Honourable Frederick Cavendish, commonly called Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Right Honourable Lord Scarsdale, Thomas Allsopp, Thomas Bainbrigge, Philip Barnes, John Bingham, Joseph Bingham, John Bloodworth, Theophilus Browne, John Bingham, junior, Samuel Crompton, Thomas Coke, William Evans, Thomas Eaton, Thomas Evans, William Fitzherbert, Gilbert Fox, William Fowler, SamueKFox, Francis Fox, John Gisborne, Samuel Heathcote, William Hope, M.

An act was passed \"for paving, cleansing, lighting, and otherwise improving the streets, lanes, and other public passages and places, within the borough of Derby ; and for selling a certain piece of waste ground, situate within the said borough, called Nuns' Green, towards de fraying the expense of the said improvements.\" The vicinity of Derby presents a pleasing variety of scenery, enriched by verdant meadows, woods and water. The best views to be obtained of the town are on the east, from Chaddesden"], [473, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 445 hill, or the meadows ; on the west, from a field at the top of the hill going along Penny-long lane, from the Uttoxeter road, or from the top of the County prison ; on the south-west from a field on the Burton road, a little beyond Mr. Pilkington's house. In every view All Saints' tower forms an important feature. The greater part of the town being in an open valley cannot be seen from a distance of more than ten or twelve miles any way. It is most open to the south. The soil in the neighbourhood of the town is chiefly red marl, with a substrata of quartz and gravel, which often lies a great depth. It is rich and very productive. On the borders of the borough, much of it is laid out in garden ground, and let to the inhabitants, in small patches, at the average rate of \u00a310. per acre. The pasture lands let from \u00a3i. to \u00a37. per acre. In the im mediate vicinity of Derby there is but little arable land. Clay is abundant, and bricks are made near the Uttoxeter and Burton roads, of a good colour and consistency. The air of the surrounding hills is particularly pure, and that of the town itself cannot be charged with any defect of salubrity. Though placed in a valley, watered by a large river and a wide rivulet, it is not subjected to the mephitic fogs of stagnate waters. As many persons, in proportion to the population, has attained to old age, and even outlived a hundred years, in Derby, as in other places, and the general health of the inhabitants is good. The water is abundant, and the spring water used for beverage and culinary purposes is clear and wholesome. The floods, occasioned by the swollen waters ofthe Derwent and the Markeaton brook, were formerly injurious at periods when heavy rain on the Peak hills have caused the Derwent to overflow its banks. Latterly a culvert has been constructed to relieve the lower parts of the town from this inconvenience. The general supply of water for culinary use is raised from the Derwent by an engine at the bottom of St. Michael's lane, and conveyed through a pipe into a reservoir at the top of St. Mi chael's church, about the distance of one hundred yards, and the height of twelve. From thence, as from a grand artery, the stream is conveyed by tubes, under the pavement, into many of the streets and courts. Exclusive of this ample supply from the river, springs are common : the water, which is very hard, lies within a few feet of the surface, and is raised by pumps. The Market-place and St. Peter's pumps are supplied from Becket's well, which is excellent water. The Water Company has been established more than a century. It is now divided into three shares; viz. Walter Evans, esq. Mrs. Chambers, of London, and the Commissioners under the paving and lighting act. The representative of the latter is Joseph Strutt, esq. Navigation. \u2014 \" Although few places are more subject to floods, yet there are few that can enjoy equal benefit from a watery situation. This verifies the old adage, ' There is no evil without its good.' While the two streams run smiling on, they seem to say to the inhabitants of Derby, 'We are well adapted for the manufactures, use us with caution, and we will serve you. Riches for the master, and employment for the servant, may be drawn from our sources.' \" The river Derwent ran useless for ages. No wheel was turned by its powers ; no barge float ed upon its surface. But in later ages it has, in some degree, been applied to the use of man. An act was obtained in 17 1 9 to make it navigable to the town; which opened the markets for heavy goods, such as were before excluded through bad roads and expensive conveyance. This produced a singular benefit, by taking off a redundancy, procuring the articles wanted at an easy price, and finding employment for the workman.\" The Derby canal, for which an act of parliament was obtained in 1793, superseded the Der went navigation. We have noticed this canal at page 230 in the first Volume. The town is well situate for the conveyance of all kinds of goods by land and inland naviga tion. Heavy goods from London to Derby, by sea to Hull, and from thence by the Trent navi gation, are conveyed at 20.. per ton ; by inland navigation, which is rather more certain and a quicker conveyance, from 50.?. to 70.. per ton ; by wagon, from Derby to London, 7_. and by van or coach Us. per hundred weight: by boat, from Derby to Birmingham, \u00a3l.; and by wagon, \u00a32. per ton ; and by wagon from Derby to Sheffield, \u00a32. per ton. Great advantage is derived by mercantile and manufacturing towns having good roads and a quick and ready communication with other large towns, in this respect Derby stands unrivalled."], [474, "446 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Several principal lines of road concentrate at Derby, in consequence of its central situation, and its importance as a manufacturing town.

They are kept by Mr. Hoare, at the King's Head Inn, Mr. W. W. Wallis, Mail Office, Mr. Price, at the White Lion Inn, Mr. Charles Holmes, Coach maker, Mr. Barrowclough, Mr. Briggs and Mr. Swindell. The Posting Houses are the King's Head Inn, Corn-market, Bell Inn, Sadler-gate, New Inn and Royal Mail Office, King-street. Besides these posting houses there are many excellent Inns for the accommodation of the market people, commercial travellers and strangers, in almost every street in the borough. The most central are the Royal Oak, Market-place; the Tiger, the Red Lion, and the White Lion, Corn-market ; the Talbot, Iron-gate ; the Three Tuns and others, in Sadler-gate ; the Shakspeare, Bold lane ; the King's Arms and County Tavern, St. Mary's-gate \u25a0 the Bull's Head, Dolphin, and others, Queen-street; the Fox and Owl, Bridge-gate ; the Duke of Devonshire, Goodwin-street ; the Castle and Falcon, and others, Morledge, the Nag's Head, Swan, and others, St. Peter's-street. The fairs either granted or confirmed by king James's charter, were, Friday in Easter week, May 4th, Thursday before Midsummer, and September 26th, each fair being for two days. The charter of Charles II. grants or confirms seven fairs: viz. Friday after the Epiphany; Friday in Easter week ; Friday after St. Philip and St. James ; Friday in Whitsun week ; Friday before the nativity of John the Baptist ; St. James's day, and Friday before September 29th, most of them being for two days. In 1732, the corporation had a grant of two new fairs, one for three days, beginning September 16th, the other for two days, beginning on the festival of St. Paul. In 1734, the corporation appointed an annual meeting for the sale of latter made cheese to con tinue three days, beginning on the 12th of March, altered four years afterwards to the 21st of March, and two following days. The fairs for cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, cheese and pedlery are generally well attended. They are held on Monday after January 25th for cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and pedlery ; on the 21st and 22nd days of March, for cheese ; on Friday in Easter week, on Friday after May-day, on Friday in Whitsun week, and on the 25th of July, for cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and pedlery; on the last Tuesday in August, a market for cheese; on the 27th, 28th and 29th days of September, for cheese, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and pedlery; and on the 10th of October, for cattle, horses, sheep, &c. The markets are well supplied with corn, butchers' meat, poultry, butter, eggs, vegetables, &c. They are held on Wednesday for butter and vegetables ; on Friday, the principal, for butter, eggs, butchers' meat, vegetables, corn, earthenware, &c. ; and on Saturday, for butchers' meat and vegetables.

Derby being situate in the centre of the kingdom, with water conveyance to every part, good coal in the immediate neighbourhood, and two copious streams flowing through it, renders it ex tremely favourable for the institution and carrying on of manufactures which require the aid of water or steam power. These advantages have caused many capitalists to establish various works in the town and its vicinity. Their success has also been greatly promoted by the judicious applica tion of machinery ; and mills of the most improved construction have been erected for a variety of * Those marked thus \u2022)\u25a0 have served the office of under-sheriff."], [477, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 449 purposes. Owing to the variety ofthe manufactures carried on here, the inhabitants seldom ex perience those serious changes caused by the failure or temporary depression of any one in parti cular, which is so frequently felt in those towns where the manufacture is confined to one. Having already noticed the principal branches of trade and manufactures, carried on within the borough, in our Chapter on the Trade and Commerce of the County, inserted in the first volume, it will only be necessary to repeat what are now the principal manufactures carried on within the borough, and what have been the leading branches from the earliest times. In 1 1 99, in the reign of king John, an exclusive privilege was granted to the burgesses of Derby to dye cloth. This business continued to be the staple manufacture of the borough for some centuries ; for we find three fulling mills are mentioned in queen Mary's grant to the bur gesses of Derby. The manufacture and dyeing of wool flourished until the introduction of the silk mill, by that ingenious mechanic, John Lombe, in 1717- Indeed, it appears that long after the silk mill was introduced, the woolcombers were numerous; for, in 1749, we find the woolcombers, who walk ed in procession to All Saints' church, on the celebration of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, formed a considerable body. In 1780, Messrs. Barber erected a machine to spin wool for the manufac ture of carpets. The only wool staplers now in the borough are Messrs. Hind and Cooper. About two centuries ago, according to Camden, the chief trade consisted in malting and brew ing ale ; which he speaks of as being in great request, and much celebrated in London, to which city large quantities were sent. Fuller, in his usual quaint style, remarks, \" to make malt for drink was indeed a master-piece. How much of philosophy concurred to the first kiln of malt ! And before it was turned on the floor, how often was it tossed in the brain of the first inventor thereof! First to give it a new growth more than the earth had bestowed thereon. Swelling it with water to make it last the longer by breaking it, and taste the sweeter by corrupting it. Secondly, by making it to pass the fire, the grain (by art fermented) acquiring a lusciousness (which by nature it had not) where by it doth both strengthen and sweeten the water wherein it is boiled.\" And he adds, \" never was the wine of Falernum better known to the Romans, than the Canary of Derby to the English.\" Ale was much used as a beverage by the Anglo Saxons. In the Saxon Dialogues, preserved in the Cotton library, in the British Museum, a boy is asked what he drank : he replies, \" Ale if I have it, water if I have it not.\" Ale was sold in houses of entertainment, for a priest was forbid den to eat or drink at Cape-ale-thetum, a place for selling ale. In 1712, Mr. Woolley says that the chief trade consisted in malting, and that large quantities of malt were sent into Cheshire, Staffordshire and Lancashire, by which many persons raised good estates ; and mentions also the trade of a baker ; this town supplying most of the Peak country with bread of hard corn. The same author tells us that Derby was famous for very good ale, which the brewers sent to London and other parts, to great advantage. There are at the present time several malting establishments, none of which are very extensive, and three wholesale breweries. The baking bu siness is chiefly confined to the borough. A considerable quantity of grain, sent from hence to the northern division of the county, passes through the hands of factors. The silk mill, being the first and largest of its kind ever erected in England, brought Derby into particular notice. This original mill is designated The Silk Mill, to denote its pre-emi nence. Its history is remarkable, as it displays the power of genius and the astonishing influence which the enterprises of a single individual has on the commerce of a country. The Italians long enjoyed the exclusive privilege of the art of silk throwing, and the merchants of other nations were dependent on that people for their participation in that lucrative article of trade, until Lombe brought it into this country. 3 M"], [478, "450 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER This mill stands on an island in the Derwent, upon large piles of oak, doubly banked, and cover ed with stone work ; on which are turned thirteen stone arches, that sustain the walls. The whole length of the building is 1 10 feet, the breadth 39 feet, and the height 55 feet 6 inches. The miU is five stories high besides the underworks, and there are eight rooms lighted by four hun dred and sixty-eight windows. Mr. Lombe expended upwards of \u00a330,000. in erecting and fit ting up this mill. All the operations are performed here, from winding the raw silk, to organzining or preparing it for the weavers. The raw silk is chiefly brought in skeins or hanks, from China or Piedmont.* That produced in the former country is perfectly white, but the produce of the latter is of a light yellow colour. The skein is first placed on an hexagonal wheel, or swift, and the filaments which compose it are regularly wound off upon a small cylindrical block of wood, or bobbin. To wind a single skein is the work of five or six days, though the machine is kept in motion ten hours a day, so astonishingly fine are the filaments of which it is formed. In this part of the process many children are employed, whose nimble fingers are kept in continual exercise by tying the threads that break, and removing the burs and uneven parts, some of which are the cases that the silkworm fabricates for its own grave, or rather for its dormitory while nature prepares it for a new mode of existence. The silk thus wound upon the bobbins, is afterwards twisted by other parts of the machinery, and is then sent to the doublers, who are chiefly women, stationed in a detached building, which stands on the same island on piles like the silk mill, and though not half so broad, is nearly 30 feet longer. Here four, seven, or ten, of the threads are united into one, according to the uses for which they are designed ; the fine kind going to the stocking weaver, the other to the manufacturer of piece goods, &c. The machinery is dispersed through five rooms, occupying the five stories. This is all put in motion by the water-wheel, which is 23 feet in diameter, and situate on the west side of the building. The elaborate machinery consists of many thousand reel bobbins, star-wheels, reels, and spindles ; but an adequate idea of the complicated assemblage of wheels and movements cannot be conveyed by words ; to be distinctly conceived it must be seen ; and even then con- \" It was not till the year 555, that two Greek monks, returning from the Indies to Constantinople, brought with them a number of silkworms, with instructions for hatching their eggs, rearing and feeding the worms, drawing out the silk, &c. upon which manufactures were set up at Athens, Thebes, and Corinth. In the twelfth century, Roger, king of Sicily, established a manufactory at Palermo, and another in Calabria, having brought workmen from the cities of Greece, which he had conquered in his expedition to the Holy Land ; and by degrees the rest of Italy as well as Spain, learned the art from the Sicilians and Calabrians. In the reign of Henry the Second, the French began to imitate their neighbours with good success ; and James the First was very desirous of having mulberry trees plant ed, and silkworms propagated in his British dominions, where, from various experiments, it appears they will thrive and work as well as in any other part of Europe."], [479, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 451 siderably more time is requisite to obtain a knowledge of its parts, and of their dependence on each other than is generally allotted to the casual visitant. All is whirling and in motion and appears as if directed and animated by some invisible power ; yet mutually dependent as every part is, any one of them may be stopped and separated at pleasure. This arises from every movement being performed by two wheels, one of which is turned by the other ; but when sepa rated, the latter preserves its rotary motion, while the other stops, as the impelling power no longer operates. In 1717, the manufacture of silk was established here by that ingenious but ill-fated mechanic John Lombe.* It is now decidedly the most important branch of trade carried on in the town. There are besides the original mill twelve others, giving employment to upwards of two thousand persons in the spinning department. The principal silk throwsters are, Mr. William Taylor, the original mill ; Messrs. Ambrose Moore and Co. the depot mill ; Messrs. Bridgett and Co. Bridge street mill; Messrs. Wright and Baker, and Mr. Samuel Job Wright, Friar-gate mills; Mr. Booth, Wardwick mill ; Mrs. Sarah Davenport, Green-lane mill ; Mr. Robert Ward, Full-street mill ; Mr. John Rawlins, Nuns'-green mill ; Mr. William Adcock, Queen-street mill. The other branches of the silk trade are weaving piece goods such as sarcenets, gros-de-Naples and other rich silks which are manufactured here equal to any in the kingdom, by Messrs. Wil son, Moore and Co. Mr. Bridgett, and Mr. Robinson. The weaving of silk ferrets, galloons, dou bles, &c. was introduced into Derby by Mr. James Peet, and the present manufacturers are, Messrs. Peet and Mr. Ralph Frost. Silk hosiery is not the least important branch of the silk trade. There are many excellent mechanics connected with this branch, and the manufacturers are men of capital. The principal manufacturers are Mr. Samuel Fox, jun. Mr. John Byng, Messrs. Peet, Mr. Thomas Bowmer, Mr. Robert Longdon, Mr. Joseph Moorley, Messrs. Symons, and Mr. Samuel Holmes. Some of these gentlemen also manufacture cotton hose. In 1750, Mr. Abijah Mellor established the jewellery business in Derby. There are now two respectable establishments carried on here by Mr. Simpson and Mr. Severne. The articles man ufactured here have long been highly esteemed for superiority of workmanship and ingenuity. The porcelain manufactory, situate on the Nottingham road, occupies an area equal to 6000 square yards, and affords sufficient room for the employment of four hundred workmen. The front extends 170 feet. This business was established in Derby, in 1750, by Mr. Duesbury. Since his decease considerable improvements have been effected through the judicious method employed in preparing the paste, and in increasing the beauty of the decorations. The porcelain manufac tured here being superior to any other for the finish and taste of the execution, has obtained great \" Mr. Lombe procured, in 1718, a patent from the crown, to secure the profits during fourteen years. But he had not pursued this lucrative commerce more than three or four years, when the Italians, who felt the effects of the theft from their want of trade, determined his destruction, and hoped that of his works would follow. An artful woman came over in the character of a friend, associated with the parties, and assisted in the business. She attempted to gain both the Italians, and succeeded with one. By these two, slow poison was supposed, and per haps justly, to have been administered to John Lombe, who lingered two or three years in agonies, and departed. The Italian escaped to his own country ; and the woman was questioned, but nothing transpired except what strengthened suspicion. Grand funerals were the fashion at this time, and Mr. Lombe's was, perhaps, the most superb ever known in Derby. A man of a peaceable deportment, who had brought a beneficial manufactory into the place, employed the poor at advanced wages, could not fail meeting with respect, and his melancholy end with pity. Exclusive of the gentlemen who attended, all the people concerned in the works were invited. The procession marched in pairs, and extended the length of Full-street, the Market-place and Iron-gate ; so that when the corpse entered All Saints', at St. Mary's. gate, the last couple left the house of the deceased, at the corner of Silkmill-lane. Besides a row of flambeaux on each side the procession, one person in every fourth couple carried a branch, with four candles, weighing a pound. Though the unhappy victim died at the early age of twenty -nine, and by a cruel death, yet the priest who preach ed his funeral sermon took for his text, \" He is brought to his grave as a shock of corn in its season.\" \u2014 There is, however, a remark in favour of this ill-chosen text : the good never quit the world out of season. Mr. Lombe dying a bachelor, his property fell into the hands of his brother William, who enjoyed, or rather pos sessed the works but a short time ; for, being of a melancholy turn, he shot himself. This superb erection then be came the property of his cousin, Sir Thomas Lombe."], [480, "452 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER celebrity. The works have long been carried on by Mr. Robert Bloor with much spirit and credit. This gentleman has erected a steam engine, added new glaze and biscuit kilns, and made other improvements to accelerate the production, and increase the durability and beauty of the ware. Many magnificent services have been sent from this factory to ornament the palaces of princes, and the mansions of the nobility. The white ware or biscuit figures peculiar to this manufactory, are equal in delicacy to any others of a similar kind manufactured in Europe. The stranger who visits this establishment will receive the most polite attention, and great gratification in inspect ing the variety and beauty of the articles manufactured. The manufacture of white and red lead, we believe, was first introduced into Derby by Messrs. Walker. These gentlemen carry on an extensive trade in those articles. The Messrs. Cox, Messrs. Goodale, and Mr. Holbrook, have also extensive lead works. \u25a0 The shot tower, a round building 1 80 feet high, stands on the Liversage charity land, in the Morledge. It was erected by Messrs. Cox and Poyser in 1809, at a great cost. On the 13th of April, 1824, it was much injured by fire. The lead is melted at the top, and poured into a pan perforated with holes, through which the lead descends into a cistern of water at the bottom, which makes it perfectly round. These gentlemen also manufacture lead pipes, sheet lead, &c. In 1734, the slitting, rolling and battering mills was erected on the Derwent, in the Morledge, to prepare iron for various uses, and for smelting, rolling and preparing copper for sheathing the navy. These mills belonged to the late Thomas Evans, esq. who successfully worked them many years. These works are now carried on by Messrs. Bingham and Co. In 1758, the celebrated Jedediah Strutt produced his machine for weaving ribbed stockings, which is still termed the Derby rib machine. Mr. Strutt, in conjunction with his brother-in law, Mr. Woollat, carried on an extensive business in hosiery until his death, and his sons still continue the business. In 1774, the Messrs. Strutt and Needham, in conjunction with Sir Richard Arkwright, estab lished the first manufactory for weaving calicoes. The same gentlemen erected two mills on the Arkwright principle for spinning cotton. The largest cotton mill in Derby, and the first fire proof mill erected in England, was built by the Messrs. Strutt, in 1793. This mill is six stories high, 115 feet long, and 30 feet wide. The floors are constructed on brick arches and paved with brick, by which means it is rendered abso lutely indestructible by fire. These gentlemen were extensive manufacturers of cotton thread, hosiery, figured waistcoat pieces, and numerous other articles, for many years, which contributed to the extension of this branch of business in a very eminent degree. This mill is now occupied for different purposes. Mr. John Baker has a mill for doubling cotton. The manufacture of clocks and watches is an old trade in Derby. The celebrated family of Whitehurst has carried on an extensive business more than a century. Their turret and other clocks and watches are held in high estimation. These have been sent to various parts of the kingdom; and Mr. John Whitehurst, jun. has recently been putting up clocks at Manchester, Oldham, and other places in Lancashire. Mr. Thomas Cooper carried on an extensive wholesale trade in watches for many years, and the Messrs. Brookhouse, and Mr. Tunnicliff, manufacture excellent time-pieces, watches and other articles. Among the numerous branches of trade carried on in Derby, the iron trade is not the least im portant. It combines strength, safety, utility and beauty. Iron founderies have been established in Derby nearly half a century. The late Mr. Thomas Wheeldon, who carried on the business many years, brought the cast iron trade to great perfection, first at the St. Peter's-street foundry, and afterwards at the Derwent foundry. The latter is now ably conducted by his son-in-law, Mr. William Gibson. In 1818, Messrs. Weatherhead, Glover and Co. establisheeKhe Britannia foundry, in Duke-street, near St. Mary's bridge. At this foundry castings have been produced of superior workmanship and design to any heretofore made in the kingdom. The beautiful cast iron gothic windows of St. John's church, and of many other churches contributed to by the commissioners, under government, for erecting churches in various parts of the country, are suffi cient testimonies of the superiority of the productions of this foundry. The elegant vases, and"], [481, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 453 particularly the cast iron temple, for the Earl of Shrewsbury's gardens, at Alton Towers, have been highly appreciated. Messrs. Falkner and Peach have a small foundry on the Chester road. The marble works are situate in St. Helen's-street, on a piece of land which formerly belonged to the monastery, dedicated to St. Helen. Mr. Brown, the proprietor, has erected some very spa cious workshops, and a steam engine of six horse power, to give motion to the ingenious machi nery employed in the manufacture of the elegant articles in which he deals. The machinery is of very ingenious construction for sawing and polishing marble and other purposes. On the vi bratory poles to which the cranks are fixed, are sliding boxes, containing sets of saws, which are nothing more than thin plates of soft iron, that drop as they cut the marble. These are supplied with sand and water ; and being moveable with screws, may be arranged at different distances, so that the slabs may be cut of any thickness. A set of saws consist of a different number of plates, so that the block to which they are applied, may be separated at one process into as many slabs as may be thought necessary. The slabs thus sawn are taken to the polishing bed, which has four wheels that move on a gangway with a very slow motion, given to it by a worm and crank. One of the slabs being fixed on this bed, another is fastened above it to an arm attached to a vi brating pole, that works with a quick motion in a transverse direction. The slabs thus moving in contact with each other, and being supplied with sand and water, soon acquire a level surface, when finer materials are employed to increase their smoothness, and give them a high and beau tiful polish. Thus the productions of the county are wrought into the most beautiful chimney pieces, monuments, columns and other ornaments. Spar manufactories. The principal of these is also at the top of St. Helen's-street, carried on by Mr. Joseph Hall, who has always a large assortment of fluor spar, or blue John, and gypsum ornaments, such as urns, vases, columns, obelisks, &c. &c. of every variety and of exquisite beauty. The stranger cannot pass a shop where these elegant ornaments are displayed without having his eye arrested, and his mind delighted. Here he sees captivating nature improved by art. Collections of the mineral productions of this county are made up by Mr. Hall, and may be ob- tained here. The other manufacturers are, Shepherdson, Spinks, Green, &c. When the blue John is to be made into a vase, or any other ornamental form that renders the use of the lathe necessary, it is first passed through the fire, then carved with a mallet and chisel into a rude resemblance of the object intended to be produced, and being afterwards strongly cemented to a plug or chock, is screwed upon the lathe, a slow motion is then given to the work ; and a bar of steel, about two feet long, and half an inch square, properly tempered, and pointed at each end, is applied to the fluor, on which water is continually dropping, to keep the tool cold, to preserve it from friction, and enable it more readily to reduce the substance on which it acts. As the surface becomes smoother, the tool is applied with more freedom, and the motion of the lathe accelerated, till the fluor has assumed its destined form. When the turning is completed, pieces of grit stone, of different degrees of fineness, are applied with water to bring the article to a proper ground for polishing with fine emery, tripoli and putty, or calx of tin. These means are continued till the fluor is incapable of receiving a higher degree of polish ; which is known when water thrown on it will no longer increase its lustre. The advantage of the lathe set in motion by water or steam power over those worked by the foot, is said to be far superior in forming hollow vases, or articles of equal delicacy. Lace manufactories. The largest of this description is the one in Castle-street, belonging to Messrs. Boden and Morley. It is a handsome structure, containing two hundred and ninety- eight windows, and occupying an area of 2124 square yards. The principal building is 56 yards long. It is fitted up with 150 machines worked by steam power, and contains an engine of twenty horse power, planing engine, casting, fitting-up and winding rooms, smiths' shops, and every convenience for such an establishment. This is not only considered the largest establish ment of the kind in the kingdom, but the most complete as regards the machinery, which has been principally constructed under the direction of Mr. Morley. It would be a difficult task to give a correct idea of the numerous and complicated movements of the beautiful machinery here"], [482, "454 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER employed. The next manufactory of importance of this description, is that of Mr. John John son, in Albion-street. There are also several smaller manufacturers. The manufacture ofthe beautiful fabric called bobbin net-lace has been introduced into Derby within the last ten years. Nottingham and Loughborough were some years the chief marts for it. Very extraordinary profits was obtained on its first introduction. This induced numbers who could raise a little capital to embark in it. The great demand for machines caused them to rise five or six times above their real value. Many tradesmen, who had been travelling steadily on in the old beaten tract, fancied they saw golden days at hand. The bobbin net machine was to be the means of realizing to the possessor a rapid and splendid fortune. In the brilliant pros pect the speculative mind became dazzled, and the head giddy, with the thought of purchasing estates, building mansions, and driving four in hand. The picture was too glowing to be real. The scene, alas ! soon changed ; many soon found they had speculated their all, and that all had surreptitiously sunk into oblivion. Others withdrew from the trade at an immense sacrifice. Lace manufactories and machinery became a drug in the market. A machine, which had originally cost from \u00a3600. to \u00a3800. might be purchased for \u00a3 100. The article manufactured fell in proportion, and the trade became vested among capitalists and the most eminent mechanics. Roman cement was first manufactured in Derby by Mr. John Brookhouse, who in conjunction with his brother, has for many years carried on an extensive business in that article and plaster. Great praise is due to Mr. John Brookhouse for discovering and producing to the country such a useful composition for buildings and ornamental work. The Messrs. Brookhouse are also emi nent plasterers, and their superiority in that department is to be seen in many noblemen and gen tlemen's mansions in this and other counties. Many hundred tons of ground plaster are annually sent to London and different parts of the kingdom from the mills of Messrs. Brookhouse and Mr. Frost. In 1806, the manufacture of tapes and small ware goods was introduced into Derby by Messrs. Riley, Hackett and Co. and these gentlemen still carry on the business. Printing and publishing establishments. The art of printing has been known and practised in Derby as long probably as in any other provincial town of the same extent. We do not, how ever know, that there is any copy of a work printed in Derby previous to the newspapers pub lished by Hodgkinson at the commencement of the last century. The business of printing as wholesale publishers was introduced into Derby by Henry Mozley, esq. in 1815. The business is now carried on with great spirit and respectability by Messrs. Mozley and Sons, who employ many persons in the various departments, and it is the largest establishment of the kind out of London. A similar business is carried on by Mr. Thomas Richardson. The other printing offices are those of Messrs. Wilkins and Son, Drewry, Pikes, Bemrose, Storer, Chadfield and Horsley. We have already noticed the engine and lathe factory of Messrs. Fox and Sons, and the engine boiler manufactory of Mr. Harrison. The stranger who has a taste for examining excellent workmanship andjngenuity would be much gratified by going through Messrs. Fox and Sons' factory. There are several dyeing establishments ; the most complete and extensive are those belonging to Mr. Thomas Tunaley, sen. and jun. and Mr. Robert Ward. Mr. Hutton, after having described the leading manufactures in Derby, concludes with this remark : \" Derby appears to have crept* silently through ages without much connexion with commerce, except what arose from her own tailors, hatters, weavers, and shoemakers, till the be ginning of the eighteenth century, when the frame, the river, the silk-mill, the porcelain, &c. awakened her drowsy talents to riches, increase and notice. The man who has known her three score years can easily discover an improvement in her external buildings, and the extension of her borders. He may as easily prophesy, that like an infant whose powers are equal to its magni tude, it can stand upon its own basis, and will rise more rapidly towards maturity.\" Mr. Hut- * This worthy old historian of his native town seems to have forgotten the dyers and bleachers ofthe days of king John, and that Derby was the staple town for wool in the reign of Edward III. to say nothing of its trade in malt and ale in the fifteenth century."], [483, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 455 ton's prophecy was correct. Derby has trebled her inhabitants since he made the observation, and her manufactures have gradually increased. Derby races were formerly held on Sinfen moor, and obtained great celebrity. They are now held in a large field called the Siddalls, belonging to the corporation, situate on the south-west bank of the Derwent. In which a handsome and commodious stand has been erected for the ac commodation of the nobility and gentry. There is no king's plate, which is to be regretted. The Duke of Devonshire is the greatest supporter. His Grace gives sixty guineas, to be run for by maiden horses, two mile-heats ; and a stake of twenty-five guineas, for one heat of about a mile and a half: a subscription gold cup, value one hundred guineas, for horses of all ages, three miles \u2014 these are run on the first day. The second day's races are, the noblemen and gentlemen's sub scription plate of sixty guineas, for horses of aU ages, three mile-heats ; a sweepstakes of twenty guineas each, for two year olds, half a mile ; and a sweepstakes of five guineas each, for three year old colts, a mile and a half, and sometimes a hunters' stake is run for. The races are gen erally held about the latter end of July. Assembly Room. \u2014 The Old Assembly-room in Full-street, was opened in the year 1714, and there are accounts of the expenditure to the year 1751, of which we subjoin some extracts. These consist of an entry of the receipts and expenditure in the year 1721, by which our readers may compare these amusements at that period with the expenses ofthe present period. During the greatest part of the above mentioned period of thirty-seven years, the assemblies were conducted by the following Lady patronesses ; viz. Mrs. Pole, Lady Pye, Mrs. Coke, Mrs. Wilmot, Lady Atkins, Mrs. Goodwin, Mrs. Chambers, Mrs. Bayley, Mrs. Fitzherbert, Mrs. Barrow, Mrs. Bate, Mrs. Woolley, Mrs. Eyre, Mrs. Mundy, Lady Every, and Mrs. Mundy, of Allestree. These ladies appear to have taken the quarters in turns, and to have kept and passed their accounts with great regularity. Under their patronage the assemblies were well attended, and the funds grad ually increased. But, from 1741 to 1752, Mrs. Barnes was the sole Lady patroness, and during those eleven years, she appears to have exhausted the funds, keeping her accounts very irregular ly and never passing them. In 1752, she resigned her patronage, and made the following curious entry in the account-book, which shows how pointedly the distinctions of society were maintain ed at that time: \u2014 \"August 4th.

It is built of stone in the style of architecture generally termed Roman, on a rusticated basement. It was built, by subscription, between the years 1763 and 1774. The dancing room is 30 feet high, 68 feet long, 32 feet wide, and contains an elegant loft for the musicians. It is fitted up with splen did chandeliers and sconses, which together with rich drapery adapt it for the reception of the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. On one side is a card room with a coved roof, sup ported by pillars, and below are the tea rooms. The property is in the hands of trustees. The land on which the New Assembly room stands was purchased from Hodgkinson, of Little Chester, and his wife, 4th June, 1718, by Thomas Chambers, of London, merchant, for \u00a3150. : these premises consisted of a messuage or dwelling house, divided into several tenements, bought by Hodgkinson from Thomas Street, in lb'72, release for one year, witnessed by Arthur Dakeyne and Richard Dakeyne, for the sum of \u00a354. The Duke of Devonshire purchased the above premises for \u00a3400. and presented them to the Committee appointed to build the New As sembly-room.

These performances are respectably conducted, and have conduced much to the cultivation and improvement of the musical taste of the neighbourhood. This Society was established in 1817, and was for several years conducted under the direc- tion of Mr. Alcock. It has now increased to the number of sixty members. The present leader and conductor is Mr. Gover, under whose judicious direction the combined talents of the society have progressed rapidly, and have been rendered available in a great degree to the fur- therance ofthe charitable institutions ofthe neighbourhood. The patrons are, His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, the Right Hon. Lord Cavendish, M. P. the Hon. Admiral Curzon, the Hon. and Rev. Frederick Curzon, Sir Charles Henry Colvile, Ed- ward Strutt, esq.

Theatre. \u2014 The history of theatricals in Derby resembles that of every provincial town. There was formerly no regular theatre, and itinerant performers occasionally exhibited dramatic pieces in private rooms,* or in the barns of inns. The back ofthe Old George Inn, between the Iron and the Sadler gates, was the principal site of these exhibitions, until the theatre was built in Bold lane, in 1773, by Mr. Whiteley. Mr. Manly, with a very good company of performers, who are frequently aided by the most popular actors and actresses of the London stage, attends here at regulated seasons, of which the principal consists of six weeks from the Friday after Easter- day ; and a short period at the races.

It will hold about \u00a390. There are two subscription bowling greens, one on the Nottingham road, kept by Mr. Thomas Tatlow, and one in St. Peter's-street, kept by Mr. Brown. These are attended by the respect able tradesmen of the borough. The game of foot-ball we have noticed in the seventh chapter ofthe first volume. The Philosophical Society, in St. Helen's-street, was established in February, 1783, by the fol lowing gentlemen, who met for that purpose at the house of the celebrated Dr. Darwin, in Full street : Dr. Darwin, Mr. French, Mr. Sneyd, Dr. Beridge, Dr. Pigot, Mr. Darwin, Mr. Leaper, Mr. Gisborne, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Strutt. The present Society consists of twenty-nine resident and seventeen non-resident members. Dr. Forester is the president. In 1815, the total num ber of volumes was 1486, and the members of the society thirty -nine. The building in St. Helen's-street contains a capital library, with mathematical and philosophical apparatus, speci mens of fossils, &c. The Permanent Library, established on the premises of Messrs. Wilkins and Son, Queen-street, in 1811, contains a large collection of popular works. It is in the hands of a society, of which the number of members, in 1 832, were eighty-four. The shares in this literary establishment are sold at four guineas, and the annual subscription is one guinea. The Mechanics' Institution, established in August, 1825, commenced its operations with the most favourable prospects of success. The two first courses of lectures, were delivered to the members, on the sciences of Chemistry and Anatomy, by Mr. Douglas Fox, surgeon, in a manner well adapted to the understandings of his audience, who, by the strong interest they manifested, afforded a striking proof of the immediate benefit of the institution, and excited a gratifying an ticipation of its future advantages. The following remarks by Mr. Noble, the editor of this work, are prefixed to an interesting report of Mr. Fox's introductory lecture : \" We know,\" says a contemporary writer, \" of no way in which greater good can be done, than by removing ignorance, in which most of the evils of life have their origin. We believe that this is a truth which is almost universally admit ted ; and the only question will be, What is the nature of the knowledge that ought to be impart ed ? First, we would ask the question, What is the nature of the knowledge that ought to be de nied ? Here the proof of the negation lies most decidedly with the objector. He that would limit human acquirements takes upon himself a most serious responsibility ; lie that asserts for himself, or his class, a monopoly of any species of information is called upon to make his and their title good upon the most incontrovertible evidence, or he stands forward in a position very little to be envied. It is with a perfect conviction that all the branches of knowledge are de pendent on and illustrative of each other, that we rejoice to find no limit or peculiar direction at tempted to be given to the acquirements now offered to the operative manufacturers at the Me chanics' Institutions, either here, in Derby, or elsewhere. It is for such institutions to be general ; individuals will afterwards select and pursue the objects of their particular choice. That every person who enters an institution will receive information, there can be no doubt ; and whether or not that information tend directly or only indirectly, to aid him in the pursuits to which he may be by study engaged, or by choice devoted, still who will say, when he quits its hall, he has not a more enlarged view of the pursuits of his fellow men, and therefore of the general bearings and interests of society ? Our labour and daily tasks are frequently, and will be, as they ought to be, generally the primary objects of our study ; but he must have a very narrow capacity himself, or a very indifferent acquaintance with human nature, who supposes that the mind of man can be bound down to the contemplation of its daily tasks. It is the perpetual anxiety to relieve our selves from the tedium of one narrow track of impressions that produces more than half the mise ries of society. We are not so much exhausted as we are satiated by the monotony of ideas when we have lain down our tools, or withdrawn our long continued attention from our appointed du ties. We look for a new train of ideas, a new channel of thought ; we look, in a word, for the relief of change ; and it is from a want of that information which might enable us to participate"], [487, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 459 in the knowledge that elevates and enlarges the understanding, that we are induced to fly to re laxations that degrade us, and to the communication of the lowest animal ideas; which low ideas finding us incompetent to enter into more ennobling discussions, take possession of all the remain ing faculties of our heads and our hearts. Hence it is that the plan of the Mechanics' Institu tions ought to be acted upon as extensively as possible ; it is by such a plan that men acquire en larged views of society, relinquish their unfounded prejudices, and learn to respect themselves even when they most closely investigate the propositions and opinions of one another. Men thus instructed, easily comprehend each other, and the relaxations of conversation, instead of abasing the soul, become, indeed, a feast of reason.\" The first newspaper published in Derby, we have reason to believe was the British Spy, or Derby Postman. This publication made its appearance in 1726: it was published on a halfpenny stamped paper, by S. Hodgkinson, and the price was 2d. or 2.. per quarter. This paper soon ceased after the appearance of the Mercury, which was first published on Thursday, the 23rd of March, 1732, by Mr. Samuel Drewry, in the Market-place, at 2<_. each paper, or 2s. per quar ter. This continued to be the only paper published in the county, with some slight exceptions, until 1823. Prior to which there had been several unavailing attempts to establish a second news paper in Derby. The last was by Mr. Harrison, brother to the celebrated singer. The Reporter commenced on the 1st of January, 1823. It was at its publication edited by Mr. Noble, ancl has been spiritedly conducted by the proprietor, Mr. Walter Pike. This paper is published on the Thursday, and the proprietors have an increasing demand for it. The Mercury, which has been established a century, takes the lead in the extent of circulation and in the number of adver tisements. It is published by Mr. Drewry, on the Wednesday. In the Appendix to the first volume will be found a list of the magistrates for three hundred and twenty years, and of the representatives of the borough for five hundred and thirty-eioht years. It is curious to observe the rude state of letters which those lists exhibit. There seems no fixed principles in the use of the alphabet ; for a man seldom spelt his name twice alike, nor is it a wonder we see confusion in those early documents, as but few of the principal inhabitants were capable of using the pen. A gradual improvement may easily be traced. We also observe the fluctuation of parliaments. In some years three or four was held, and then again thirteen or four teen years elapsed without any. From the earliest times Derby was a prescriptive borough, under the government of bailiffs. According to the charter of James the First, it was incorporated by the name and style of Mayor and Burgesses. In 26 Edward I. it returned burgesses to parliament, and has continued so to do to the present time. By the charter of Charles II. (1680) the representatives for the borough were to be chosen by the corporation, free men and sworn burgesses, the mayor being the return ing officer. The burgesses were then estimated at 655. In 1791, Mr. Hutton states their num ber at about 900. But few contested elections have taken place within the last one hundred and fifty years. In 1700, the contest was between Sir Richard (quere Charles) Pye and Sir John Harpur, the num ber of voters that polled were 537 ; but as Sir Richard Pye was 137 votes a head, the contest was given up. In 1701, January 3, Thomas Stanhope, esq. petitioned against the return of Lord James Cavendish, by means of illegal practices on the part ofthe mayor ofthe borough. There was no determination on this petition. In 1710, three gentlemen contested for the honour of serving as representatives ; viz. Lord James Cavendish, John Harpur, esq. (high sheriff of the county) and Sir Richard Levinge; the two latter were returned: Lord James Cavendish peti tioned against their return, but, on the 19th of February, 1711, he withdrew his petition. In 1714, the most violent contest ever known in the borough took place. The opponents were Sir Nathaniel Curzon, bart. and Edward Mundy, esq. the late members, against Lord James Caven dish and Sir William Stanhope. The opposition rose to such violence that even the highways, hedges and sinks of obscurity were ransacked for electors. The number polled was 862. The two former gentlemen having lost the election, petitioned against the return of Lord James Cavendish and Sir William Stanhope, but they afterwards withdrew their petition. In May,"], [488, "460 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 1 734, the contest was between Lord James Cavendish, Charles Stanhope, William Curzon and Richard Harpur, esquires. Lord James polled 295 votes, Stanhope 285, Curzon 222, and Har pur 188. In 1742, a severe contest took place between Lord Duncannon (the Devonshire inter est) and German Pole, esq. At this election 646 burgesses polled. Lord Duncannon, at the time Mr. Pole relinquished, headed the pole 46 votes. Mr. Pole petitioned against the return of Lord Duncannon, but afterwards withdrew his petition. In 1747, another contest took place between Lord Duncannon, John Stanhope, and German Pole, esquires. The two former gentlemen polled 400 votes each, and the latter 251. In 1748, the borough was contested by Thomas Rivett and Thomas Stanhope, esquires. At this election 643 burgesses polled, and Mr. Rivett was the suc cessful candidate. In 1774, a severe contest occurred between Lord Frederick Cavendish, John Gisborne, and Daniel Parker Coke, esquires. The two former gentlemen were returned. Mr. Coke and several of the electors petitioned against the return of Mr. Gisborne's election, and the committee declared that Mr. Coke was duly elected. The present members are, the Hon. H. F. C. Cavendish, a colonel in the army, silver stick and equerry to his majesty William IV. ; and Ed ward Strutt, esq. The Act for reforming the representation of the people in the House of Commons, which receiv ed the royal assent on Ihursday, June 7, 1832, extends the elective franchise to householders, at \u00a310. a year rent, throughout the borough. The number of electors for the borough members will therefore be about 1500. The burgesses held the town in fee-farm before the year 1204, when king John granted them the same privileges which the burgesses of Not tingham enjoyed ; and confirmed their mercatorial guild, on condition of which they were to pay an increase on the old rent of \u00a310. per annum. The borough was then governed by a provost, whom the charter gives them power to elect and remove at pleasure. Henry 111. granted as a privilege to the burgesses, in 1261, that no Jew should reside in Derby. It appears that among the privileges which the burgesses of Derby claim- ed and were allowed in 13.0, were four weekly markets, to be held on Sunday, Monday, Wed nesday, and from Thursday eve to Friday eve ; a fair on Thursday and Friday in Whitsun eve and another for seventeen days, commencing eight days before the festival of St. James. Richard III. granted the burgesses power to choose a bailiff, to have a jail, &c. Queen Elizabeth first granted the burgesses the privilege of two bailiffs. James I. in 1611, granted them a charter, by which their corporation was made to consist of two bailiffs and twen ty-four burgesses, with a recorder, chamberlain, and other officers. Among the privileges grant ed by James the First's charter, was, that no stranger should carry on trade in the town, except at the markets and fairs. In 1629, Charles I. granted the burgesses a new charter. The government ofthe town continues to be conducted under the charter obtained from Charles II. in the year 1680. A translation of this charter is printed in the Appendix to the first volume. The body corporate consists often aldermen, including the mayor ; fourteen brethren, out of which the aldermen are chosen ; fourteen capital burgesses, or common councilmen, who rise into brethren ; a high steward, a recorder, a town clerk, and six constables, the last are appointed an nually. The four senior aldermen are perpetual magistrates ; the mayor is also vested with the same powers during his mayoralty and the year following. The corporation appoint the keeper of the borough jail, pindar, town crier and other officers. They are empowered to hold a court of record and quarterly and petty sessions : the former are regularly advertised, and the latter are held by the magistrates acting for the borough, every Monday and Friday, at the town hall. The following were the officers of the corporation, under the charter, in the year 1 832. High Steward. His Grace the Duke of Devonshire. Recorder. John Balguy, esq. Aldermen.

Mr. John Hill, jun. surgeon, The corporation estate was granted in 1553, by queen Mary, who, in consideration of \u00a3266. assigned to the corporation fifty-four separate estates, which had belonged to the abbey of Dar- ley, to the college of All Saints', the guild of the Holy Trinity, the chantry of St. Mary in All Saints' college, and the free chapel of St. James. These estates consisted of about eighty-six houses, chiefly in Derby, and about 2 1 6 acres of land in and near the town ; divers tithes of hay, corn, wool, lamb, &c. St. Mary's mill, three fulling mills, and one water mill, called the Derwent mills ; the free chapel of ?t. James with all the lands, the advowson of the churches of All Saints', St. Michael's, and St. Peter's, in Derby, and the manor and advowson of Heath : all which said messuages, lands, tenements, tithes, &c. were of the clear yearly value of \u00a377. 2s. Id. Out of the issues of these estates the corporation were to pay, every Michaelmas, into the exchequer the fee- farm rent of \u00a341. Us. lid.; and the further sums of ls. yearly to Thomas VVarde and his heirs ; lOd. to the chamberlain-; ; li. to the churchwardens of All Saints'; \u00a313. 6s. 8d. to two priests for performing duty in All Saints'; \u00a36. 13s. id. to the minister of St. Alkmund's; and the sum of \u00a3l. 13s. id. to the bailiffs for collecting the rents. The grant ordains that a free school for ever shall be maintained by the said corporation; to the master and usher \u00a313. 6s. Sd. to be paid quarterly by equal portions every year. (See copy of the grant, page 1 5, in the Appendix to the first volume.) The corporation estate has been continually wasting, and, as Mr. Hutton justly observes, it would be difficult for the most penetrating eye to find out the fifty-seven estates. For what trust, adds Mr. Hutton, can withstand fifty-seven temptations ! In 1791, Mr. Hutton esti- mated the corporation estates at \u00a32000. a year. Since\" his time much valuable land and premises have been disposed of; viz. the Bradshaw Hayes, about 14. acres, at \u00a3200. per acre, and much land for building purposes ; the proceeds of which is probably invested in the funds.

Sir Thomas White, knt. late alderman of London, gave towards the maintenance of the clothing trade in the borough, every four and twentieth year, \u00a3100. \u00a3200. whereof are already received, and upon Bartholomew's day, 1644, there is another \u00a3 1 00. to be received in Merchant Taylors' hall, in London ; every of which \u00a3100. received and to be received is to be lent to four several per sons, viz : \u00a3'25. apiece for ten years, upon good security, and to be used in the clothing trade ; and so from ten years to ten years for ever; and \u00a34. with every hundred is ;dso allowed their de duct-no- the charges. According to this upwards of \u00a31000. has been received for the above pur poses by the corporation of Derby. The Free Grammar School, in St. Peter's church-yard, is supposed to be one of the most ancient endowments ofthe kind in the kingdom. Queen Mary, by charter, bearing date 21st May, in the first year of her reign (1554) gave and granted to the bailiffs and burgesses ofthe town of Derby, and their successors, for ever, divers messuages, lands, &c. in that town and elsewhere in the county of Derby, subject to certain yearly payments therein mentioned ; and her majesty ordained and granted that thenceforward there should be one free grammar school for the instruction and education of boys and youths in the said town of Derby, to be for ever supported by the bailiffs and burgesses of that town, and that the said bailiffs and burgesses, and their successors, out of the revenues of the premises there by granted, should yearly, for ever, pay to the master and under master, for the time being, of such free grammar school, \u00a313. 6s. 8d. In 1638, king Charles the First granted a new charter to the Corporation of Derby, by the name of the Mayor and Burgesses of the Borough of Derby. The gramm-r school, which adjoins to St. Peter's church-yard, in Derby, consists of a large room below, and some smaller rooms above. The building is kept in repair by the corporation. 'I he Rev. James Bligh, the present master of this school, was appointed to that situation by the"], [493, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 465 corporation in 1793, with a yearly salary of \u00a340. payable out of their revenues. Until the year 1813, there was also an usher of this school, with a yearly salary of \u00a320. paid by the corporation but the person who held that office, having died in that year, and the number of boys being so very small, no successor was appointed. It has been considered by the corporation that all the payments made by them beyond the an nual sum of \u00a3 1 3. 6s. 8d. directed by the charter, have been voluntary on their part. It appears, however, that Jane Walton, by her will, bearing date 23rd November, 1605, and proved in the consistory court of Lichfield in the following year, gave \u00a340. to the bailiffs and common council of Derby, to be employed by them to the best relief of the head schoolmaster and usher, teaching in the free school at Derby, so as the stock might continue for that use for ever. A small part, therefore, of the salaries of the master and usher was referable to the interest of this legacy. She also gave the sum of \u00a3100. to the Master and Fellows of St. John's College, Cambridge, for the maintenance of such scholars as should come from Derby school, and be admitted of that house. In addition to the above, an annual sum of \u00a320. is paid by the Master and Fellows of Emanuel College, Cambridge, towards the support of this school, in respect of Francis Ash's charity. All the sons of the burgesses of Derby are considered as being entitled to gratuitous instruction in the classics at this school. In 1826, there were only two boys in the school, both sons of burgesses. This school appears to have been formerly in considerable repute both for boarders and day scholars, and it is to be regretted (to whatever cause it may be attributable) that the number of scholars is now so small, and that so little advantage is derived from the establishment. The master and usher are joint lecturers, on Crowshaw's foundation, at All Saints', for which purpose he left \u00a310. to each. The Rev. James Bligh now receives both salaries. Anthony Blackwall, author of the Sacred Classics, was head master of this school. And since his time, the school has been held in great estimation. While the Rev. Thomas Manlove was head master, the principal part of the sons of the nobility and gentry around Derby received their edu cation at this school. Here Flamsteed, the astronomer, received the early part of his education. If the funds belonging to this school were properly investigated, they would be found sufficient to pay the masters such salaries as would enable them to provide Latin, English grammar and accounts for all the burgesses' sons in Derby. It is a matter of surprise that the burgesses, who are all interested in this school, do not cite the corporation to show what proportion of their property is applicable to this school, and also petition to have the system altered, so as to make it more generally useful to their sons, by introducing into it English grammar, writing and ac counts.

In 1825, an Act was obtained for paving and lighting the town. By this Act the Commis sioners were allowed to borrow the sum of \u00a320,000. at 4 per cent, to be laid out in improving and lighting the town.

Some time ago much dissatisfaction was expressed at the high charges of the Company, and several large consumers in consequence put up apparatus to supply themselves, which induced the Company to reduce the price of gas. The town of Derby is rapidly becoming distinguished among the provincial capitals of the kingdom for improvements, which blend the two characteristics of perfection \u2014 elegance and util ity. The streets, particularly the main thoroughfares, are gradually being divested of obstruc tions, and with the approaches to the borough in every direction, have undergone the process which gives smoothness and safety to the carriage ways. In public buildings, Derby probably surpasses every county town of similar extent. We cannot look around us without discovering proofs that the Improvement Bill obtained about seven years ago, has been acted upon with energy, taste and judgment, and that the commissioners merit the thanks of the community for the spirit, intelligence and prudence with which they have employed the parliamentar}' powers intrusted to them. The Market-place is about 1 10 yards by 55. The increased population of the borough and the number of country people who regularly attend on the principal market-day, caused the Market place to be exceedingly crowded and inconvenient. This induced the Corporation to purchase premises and to build a new market on the south side of, and communicating with, the old mar ket. The new market, consisting of one hundred shops for butchers, &c. a butter market, and a covered space for fruit and vegetable stalls, &c. occupies a space of ground at the back of the town hall, between the corn market and the Morledge, and communicating with both.

It commu nicates on the right with the Magistrates' retiring-room, Jury-room and private staircase, and on the left with the public staircase and lobby. There are besides on this floor, two small rooms, and one for witnesses attending the sessions. The accommodations on the ground floor are, on the right of the archways, a police-office, magistrates' room and a retiring room ; and on the left, the court of requests, watch-house, and savings' bank. Underneath the whole are arched vaults, which are approached by steps from the new Market-place. The back elevation is lower by the height of one common story, than the front, and though destitute of either columns or pilasters, yet has cornices, architraves and a pediment in the same general style of architecture. This building cost upwards of \u00a37000. The architect was Matthew Haberson, esq. ; the contractors, Messrs. Bridgard, and the clerk of the works, Mr. Mason. Derby has had a succession of guild halls for many centuries. Mr. Hutton describes two which stood on the same site in the market-place ; the latter of which has recently been taken down. The most ancient, says Hutton, seemed to have stood more than two hundred years ; it was wood and plaster ; the roof was tiled, in the form of a large old fashioned span : it had two stories ; the lower was called the town prison, and was divided into cells, as all prisons ought, that two rogues may not communicate their vices; the upper was a large room for corporation use, to which the company ascended by a steep flight of wooden stairs projecting into the market-place, covered also with a roof of tiles. The hall, the stairs, the conduit, and the cross, then in being, nearly choaked up the little market-place. In 1 730, this venerable building was taken down, and the late town hall erected, which, says Mr. Hutton, is an honour, a beauty and a use. The guild hall, recently removed out of the mar ket-place, owing to the situation on which it was built, as Mr. Hutton justly observes, was a disgusting beauty. Why the late town hall was not built where the present one now stands, was owing to the extravagant price required from the corporation by the owner ofthe property, who knew the corporation could go to no other market. They offered an extravagant price, and the seller asked one more extravagant. Astonished at the enormous sum, the corporation refused to purchase and began to build, when he sunk his price to theirs, but it was too late. Thus a lasting benefit was sacrificed for a present profit ! What a pity the corporation did not suffer themselves to be bit by extortion, rather than have placed the fabric where it stood, to the detriment of the market people, for a century. Prisons. \u2014 Mr. Hutton says, \"four prisons in so small a place as Derby, would induce the stranger to suppose it a place of rascals ! but to the honour of the inhabitants, they are often empty. A slender prison indicates that the arts of governing are understood. Rogues are more frequently made by defective government in others, than in themselves. A wise legislator will rather nip an evil in the bud, than suffer it to grow into magnitude. If idleness is the nurse of crimes, employment must have the contrary effect. A proper regulation of diet, solitude and work, will effect the cure of a culprit when nothing else will.\" Two of these prisons were jails, and two houses of correction ; one of each for the use of the town, under the jurisdiction of the mayor ; the others for the county, under the sheriff. \" If they excite that terror in the mind which is productive of innocence, they answer a valuable purpose.\" Mr. Hutton relates the following circumstance : \" A man whom I personally knew, rather defec tive in his intellects, played upon a rusty fiddle from house to house for a livelihood : but, as the law prohibits the use of the fiddle-stick on Sunday, he solicited charity at the church-door : the officer seized him, and shut him up in a garret, in the house of correction, joining the county hall. But he, like a true-born Englishman, impatient of confinement, attempted to jump out of the window ; when, repenting one moment too late, he hung, for another moment, by a tile, when I saw both fall together into the county hall yard. Thus in ten minutes he found and left the prison empty. A crowd, full of compassion, instantly surrounded him, and blamed the officer for the seizure, who had certainly done no more than his duty ; for a common beggar ought never to be suffered in the streets : if he is able to work, let him be constrained ; if not, let the commu-"], [500, "470 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER nity support him. If the officer committed an error, it was in neglecting to bar his window ; but he never suspected a man who had lost his liberty without being criminal, would take a three story leap to recover it. The unhappy man received an injury in his back, and afterwards became crooked.\" Exclusive of these two houses of correction for small offenders, there was the town prison ; this was under the town hall. Aster that was destroyed, a small erection was added to the county prison, at the Jail brook, which bore that name. \"Here,\" says Hutton, \"in 1731, I saw the jailer himself, John Greatrex, confined a prisoner for playing at foot-ball, a sport which the mayor, Isaac Borrow, was determined to suppress. But the man who had often confined others, could not brook confinement himself; he declared, in anger, ' the prison should not hold him one night.' He fulfilled his declaration ; for he broke it, and fled before morning.\" This piace of confinement stood on Nuns'-green. \" It is an old remark, that ' the present generation are wiser than the last ;' this is verified in the chief prison, or jail, at Derby. Our ancestors erected one in a river, exposed to damp and filth, as if they meant to drown the culprit before they hanged him. A worse situation could not have been chosen : it extended across the corn-market, one of the principal streets, or, as if to hide the brook, or bind the flood. The wretched inhabitant was open to the public, and they to him. A vile arch admitted the horse passenger, and a viler the foot ; inconvenient to both, hurt ful to the stranger, dangerous to the inmate; a reflection upon the place, without one benefit as a counterbalance. But their wiser successors destroyed this ancient reproach, of some centuries standing ; and erected an elegant prison upon Nuns'-green, in 1 756. Here the culprit enjoys light, air and water, which ought never to be denied even the offender. The town has the credit of a handsome and suitable edifice; the Duke of Devonshire the pleasure of contributing \u00a3400. towards the erection ; and the traveller is delighted with the object.\"* The present borough jail and house of correction is situate in the Friar-gate. It was used as the county prison until 1 825, when it was purchased by the corporation for about \u00a33000. It is a plain brick building. The front is from an excellent design, displaying solidity and strength, without that affectation of incongruous ornament so frequently exhibited in modern buildings of a similar character, the pediment is supported by four columns ofthe Doric order. The area of this prison, including the governor's house, and other buildings which occupy the whole of the front, is 126 feet by 121 feet. The ground behind these buildings is divided into * It is very probable that the old prison to which Mr. Hutton alludes, as above described, was the one erected by order of an Act of Parliament, passed 23rd Henry VIII. Previous to the passing of this Act the prison for felons for the counties of Derby and Nottingham, was at Nottingham."], [501, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 471 two parts, one of which is appropriated solely to felons, and the other to debtors and house of correction prisoners, a small part being walled off for a yard for the females. The felons have but one day room, and seven night cells 7 feet by 7 feet 4 inches, and 8 feet 3 inches high. Young and old, untried and convicted, capital and petty offenders, sick and healthy, associate to gether throughout the day, and have the means of conversing during the night. The cells are ventilated by apertures over the doors in a passage into which they open. It was frequently necessary, during the occupancy of it by the prisoners for the county, and for a long time pre vious to the assizes and sessions, to lock up four, five or six in each cell. The prison was originally designed for twenty-one criminals. A return was made to the secretary of state in 1820, when it appears, in the year 1817 there were sixty-eight; in 1818, sixty-three, and in 181 9, sixty-nine for felonies and misdemeanours, had been confined in it. The debtors and house of correction prisoners occupied the other side of the ground behind the front building, with the exception of the females' yard. They had the same airing yard. The house of correction pris oners had two small sleeping rooms, one of which was very damp, sometimes occupied by up wards of twenty persons. The females had four rooms, each 12 feet by 12 feet, and 9 feet high, and a yard 23 feet 9 inches by 12 feet 6 inches. There are now five airing yards for men and two for women, each having a day-room. There are nineteen separate sleeping cells for the male prisoners, and the females have two sleeping rooms to each yard. This jail will contain ninety prisoners. These alterations, with the addition of a tread-mill for the punishment of those sentenced to hard labour, have been made by the corporation. The number of persons commit ted to this jail in 1829 was 241, in 1830, 276, and in 1831, 281. The greatest number at any one time during 1829 was 42, in 1830, 37, and in 1831, 40. Mr. John Roberts is the jailer. The late town prison was situate in the Willow-row. It was a small inconvenient building. It consisted of the jailer's house in the front, and two small yards behind. The largest, occupied by the male prisoners of all descriptions, was 30 feet by 1 8 feet ; and the smallest, occupied by the female prisoners, was IS feet by 15 feet. In the first yard, on the ground floor, were two cells, which would hold about ten persons, and up stairs three small rooms for debtors. In the second yard there was one cell, not fit to hold more than three persons, and a small room above for women. There was no chaplain nor any divine service performed in the prison, nor rules for its government, nor employment of any kind. The following is the number of convicts transported from the borough jail during the last six years: in 1827, three males; in 1828, ten males and one female; in 1829, ten males and three females ; in 18S0, ten males and one female; in 1831, two males and two females ; and in 1832, seven males and one female. A Court of Requests for the recovery of debts under 40.. was established in 1766. The Com missioners, under the direction of a clerk, meet every third Tuesday, at the Town-Hall, to decide cases.

The court yard was once graced with an avenue of trees leading to the entrance. Mr. Hutton describes it as being handsome and convenient, long the pride of the midland circuit, longer the dread of the criminal and the client, but the delight of the lawyer. Were two evils cured (he adds) we should yet behold an accomplished piece of architecture: remove one house towards the east, and it would open the whole front ; and eight vases placed upon the summit would relieve the heavy effect of the cornice. The former suggestion has been complied with, and, on the east side of the court yard, the Judges' lodgings have been erected and furnished, at an ex pense of nearly \u00a3 16,000. paid by the county. The new county hall, though an edifice raised for the legal business ofthe county magistrates and the judges at assizes, may justly be regarded as one of the public buildings of the town in which it stands. It was opened for the business of the summer assizes on the 11th of August, 1829- The courts and accommodations of this structure are eminently commodious, and afford a fresh testimony of what may be termed the beauty of utility. By the plan and references to it, the general arrangement ofthe various accommodations will be understood with facility. County Courts. \u2014 The magistrates of the county having, in the year 1824, determined upon erecting new county courts, for the administration of justice, the garden behind the old county hall has been appropriated for this purpose. The plan fixed upon was to place the crown court on the right beyond the hall, and the nisi prius on the left, and to have a grand staircase between them. Beyond these the whole width of the hall is occupied by a set of rooms which cover the remaining space of ground as far as Wal- ker lane. They have a wide passage between them, and consist of a Jury-room and rooms for witnesses engaged in each court. There are also an office for the clerk of indictments, a judge's room, and two rooms for prisoners, one for males and the other for females. On the side next Jury-street is a yard, into which the caravan with prisoners from the jail are brought ; and from which they are deposited in these rooms to be ready for trial. The two courts are about 50 feet by 30 each, and have a gallery round three sides. The judges enter them by a private passage from their lodgings ; which lodgings are very commodi- ous, and form one side of the open court in St. Mary's-gate. The magistrates enter by doors * Mr. Hutton informs us that the masonry was executed by one Reeve, who saved nothing by the under taking, as he drank the profits as they sprung up ; and the carpentry by Roger Mo-ledge, father of him who attempt ed to curb the Derwent, who was said to have acquired as much as erected his house at the bottom of St. Helen's walk, since the residence of his family. 3 p"], [504, "474 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER formed in the pannelling of the wainscot back, at the sides of the bench of the judge in each court. The barristers, attorneys, jurymen, prisoners and witnesses enter the courts by various doors which open into the large staircase, so that there are separate entrances for each class and descrip tion of persons. All these entrances open upon the principal staircase between the two courts, to which the public have no access, with the exception of such persons as are, by the general rules of similar places, admitted into the galleries. The body of the public enter from the great hall and the seats for their accommodation in each court are raised in such a manner as to afford a full view of the proceedings. * The rooms in the upper floor behind the courts, and which are approached by the grand stair case, are the grand jury room, which is 30 feet by 20; this adjoins the crown court, into the gal lerv of which it has a door of communication. There is a retiring room attached to the grand jury room and similar accommodations for the barristers, solicitors and witnesses in attendance in both courts. The courts themselves are ample and commodious, with an elegant neatness suitable to their purpose. The gallery is supported by columns of an oriental form, with leafy capitals ; and columns of a similar form, but lighter and more enriched, sustain the roof. These columns are handsome, and are much admired. The bench for the judges in each court is elevated, and con sists of an arm chair covered with deep purple chamois, and fitted with the metallic spring cushions of Mr. Wigston. Over each bench is a sounding board, on which is affixed the county Arms carved in oak, with the addition, in the crown court, of the Royal Arms, which are carved by a very ingenious young artist. Beneath the bench in each court, is the table for the counsel, around which the learned gentlemen of the bar take their seats ; and immediately behind them are ample accommodations for the solicitors. On the left hand of the judge are the seats for the iury, with the witness box ; and on the opposite side there is an enclosed bench appropriated to the use of the reporters for the press, which is in itself a testimony of the increasing liberality and attention to public information which characterize the present period. The ventilation ofthe courts, and the warming of them by means of heated air have been ob jects of particular attention. The ventilation consists of cold-air passages below, which open into cavities in the thickness of the walls. These air-passages, passing through the floors of the gal leries, are in communication with open wire-work, with which the front of the galleries is pan nelled. By this method there is an area of upwards of sixty square feet, for the constant admis sion of pure air from without. This mode of admitting cold air in the front of the galleries, through the medium of wire-work, prevents any of the inconveniences resulting from currents or draughts, which are so frequently attended with injurious effects in crowded rooms. To preserve a change and a constant succession of this large quantity of pure air, an outlet of similar capacity, is provided in the pannels of the ceiling. The windows of the lantern lights may also be opened with facility whenever such an accommodation is found requisite. Two strong brass wires in each court, which descend from each ceiling, and are fastened to two of the columns, form the extended rods of a machine, by each of which one-half of the ceiling pannels may be opened to any required width. The simple machinery by which this is effected is placed above the timbers of the ceiling. George Benson Strutt, esq. had the chief direction of the ventilation. The courts are well lighted ; the lantern being constructed with double panes of glass, the one clear and the other ground. Each court is capable of accommodating about five hundred per sons, including all parties. On Wednesday, the 12th of August, 1829, the weather being sultry and the courts crowded, an opportunity was afforded of deciding upon the merits of the ventila tion, and it appeared admirably to effect the purpose of its construction. With regard to the warming, there is a cockle under each court, and, in general, the hot air is admitted through the same openings that are used for ventilation in summer, which is rendered much more effective by the entire walls ofthe courts being battened. To Godfrey Meynell, esq. and Matthew Habershon esq. architect, is to be attributed the credit of the general design, which is entitled to the highest commendations; and to Mr. Patterson is due the praise of having executed the whole in such a style of superior workmanship, as has met with the approbation, not only of the architect, but of"], [505, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 475 the whole committee, and of every person connected with it. It must also be observed that the works were in hand no longer than about fifteen months, a circumstance entitled to the particular attention of the public. Much praise is due to Mr. Wight, the clerk ofthe works, who superin tended the whole. The approbation of Lord Tenterden and Sir William Alexander, together with that of the hioh sheriff, the grand jury, and the gentlemen of the special jury, was repeatedly expressed ; nor was that ofthe gentlemen ofthe bar less decided. Some slight alterations were suggested, and these have been attended to. It was justly remarked that there is no echo in either of these courts ; and this circumstance was particularly noticed by Lord Tenterden, who was pleased to observe that in the courts of Lincoln, which are in many respects the best in the kingdom, the echo is in tolerable and occasions great inconvenience, and he was much gratified in finding so very detri mental an effect happily obviated in these courts. The style ofthe building is that which has been termed Roman, and was generally adopted by the architects of the seventeenth century. It is more in accordance with the present front than the Grecian now so extensively used. \u2014 The interior ofthe old hall has been newly roofed, and is fitted up and finished in character with the rest ofthe building. A balcony or gallery, four feet wide, along the whole length of the hall on the side next the courts, communicates by means of doors with the galleries within. This gallery constitutes a convenient elevated place, for ladies and others to witness the proceedings at public meetings that may be held on various occasions in the hall. In the summer of 1831, this hall was handsomely fitted up for the performance of the evening concerts at the Musical Festival of that year. The original contract was \u00a312,183. is. 3d. The new courts and alterations cost \u00a3 18,939- 8*. lid. In the grand jury room is placed the bust of a worthy magistrate, Francis Noel Clarke Mundy, esq. late of Markeaton hall, sculptured by Francis Leggett Chantrey, esq. R. A. This bust and pedestal were paid for by subscription, and formerly stood near the left hand entrance of the old hall. The pedestal bears the following inscription on its base : \" This effigy is consecrated by his countrymen to the memory of F. N. C. Mundy, esq. who having modestly declined their unanimous offer to elect him their represenative in parliament, continued to preside on the bench of Justice in this hall during a period of nearly fifty years with a clearness of judgment, and an integrity of decision well worthy of being gratefully and honour ably recorded. This excellent man, admired for the elegance of his literary productions, beloved for the gentleness of his manners, revered for his public and private virtues, lived happily at his paternal seat at Markeaton, to the age of 76 years. May his example excite emulation.\" A county court, under the jurisdiction of the sheriff, is held in the county hall for the recovery of debts under \u00a32.

Signed, PHILIP GELL, Chairman. Elevation ofthe Entrance front, The new county prison is situate between the Uttoxeter road and that part of the town of Derby called Kensington. Six acres of land belonging to Large's Hospital, have been exchanged by the Trustees for 36 acres of land in the parish of Sandiacre, belonging to the County. The six acres was valued at \u00a32400. The plans and designs of Mr. Francis Goodwin were approved"], [508, "478 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER by the committee at the Epiphany Sessions, on the l6th of January, 1823, and on the 12th of February, the committee contracted with Mr. Goodwin to be their architect, who estimated the expense of the proposed erections at \u00a337,403. exclusive of the purchase money for the land, the tread-mill, and the furniture of the cells and lodges. The committee submitted the plan to the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, and at their suggestion and recommendation the architect introduced various alterations, which increased the number of cells to 161, several of which are calculated to contain three prisoners each. This amended and enlarged plan the court approved and adopted, and the architect de- livered a new estimate, which amounted to \u00a346,208. 5s. id. exclusive of the purchase of land. The present jail, erected upon this plan, is capable of containing 315 prisoners. It was determined by the court, to borrow the money in bonds of \u00a3 100. each, under the Act of 24th George III. c. 54, and to raise annually, by the county rate, the interest and such further sum as will be requisite to discharge the debt within fourteen years. To the members of the committee the highest praise is due for their unremitted personal atten- tion to the important duties of their appointment, and their valuable services to the county. The members of the committee were the Right Hon. Lord George Charles Venables Vernon, Sir Henry Fitz Herbert, bart. Edward Miller Mundy, esq. Godfrey Meynell, esq. and W. D. Lowe, esq. These gentlemen made a highly satisfactory report of their proceedings at the Easter Sessions, in 1828, which report, after giving a plain statement ofthe expense ofthe structure, showed that the strictest economy had been observed, and at the same time held out the expectation of a speedy liquidation of the debt thus incurred by the county.

And that to his unremitted exertions, and ability in the close examination and checking of the accounts in the progress of the works, he had in each department detected and corrected several errors, to the great and manifest benefit of the county. The committee expressed their obligations to Mr. Mason in their report in the following words : \" The committee feel that they would not act with justice towards Mr. Mason, the clerk of the works, if they omit to declare to the court their entire approbation of his conduct in the discharge of every part of his duty. They feel that it would be wrong to be silent upon an occasion, where his activity, skill and fidelity have been so beneficial to the interests of the county, which, in an undertaking of such a nature and extent, are peculiarly exposed to injury.\" \" The county, it is hoped, will derive the benefits of a prison which has been pronounced by the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline to be the best plan and construction in the kingdom.\" Since the riots in October, 1831, eight martello towers have been designed by Mr. Mason, and built by Mr. Thomas Cooper, at the cost of \u00a3 1 540. These are furnished with fire arms. The boundary walls round the new prison enclose three acres of ground. The plan is upon the radiating principle, and consists of one hundred and sixty-one cells, having twenty-one wards for the classification of prisoners. The gateway is a bold and commanding edifice, exhibiting the strength of character of which the Doric order is capable. The governor's house stands in the centre, and overlooks the whole. It is one of the completest prisons in England. The Rev. George Pickering is the chaplain to the jail. The commitments for felonies, misdemeanors, and other offences, were, in 1828, 463 ; in 1829, 614 ; in 1830, 503 ; and in 1831, 566. The number for debt in 1827 were 44; in 1828, 37 ; in 1829, 50; in 1830, 47; and in 1831, 53. The convicts sent from the above prison from 1815 to 1832 are as under: transported for life, 144 ; for fourteen years, 65 ; and for seven years, 202. Mr. Richard Eaton has been many years governor of the county prison. He has filled the situation with the highest credit to himself; and has at aU times given the utmost satisfaction to the magistracy of the county. His kind and humane attention to the prisoners under his care, his firmness and resolution in the discharge of his duty, render him universally respected in the responsible office he has so long and so satisfactorily held. Ancient buildings in Derby. \u2014 The Castle. There is great uncertainty respecting both the posi tion and origin of Derby castle, of which not a vestige can be traced with accuracy. The names of Castle-fields and Castle-street are the only indications of its site, and from them, Mr. Gibson, in his edition of Camden's Britannia, published about the close of the seventeenth century, con cluded, that \" on the south-east corner of the town stood formerly a castle ; though there have been no remains of it, within the memory of man.\" At a much later period, Mr. Hutton, in his curious researches, believed that he had discovered the foundation walls of the castle in an or chard on the summit of Cock-pit-hill. He says, \" one of the mounds, eighty yards long, runs parallel with the houses on Cock-pit-hill, perhaps one hundred yards behind them ; also parallel with those in St. Peter's parish, but twice the distance.\" He adds, \" this place of security then stood out of the town in an open field, no houses were near it. It was guarded by the Derwent on one side, and on the other ran the London road. This, I apprehend, was the chief approach, because the passage afterwards bore the name of Castle-street. From thence also the fields to wards the east, now Mr. Borrow's park, acquired the name of Castle-fields.\" Since the days of Mr. Hutton, and indeed since the year 1815, almost the whole of Castle-fields and the space be tween Cock-pit-hill and St. Peter s-street have been covered with new buildings, but we have not heard of any further vestiges of the castle being discovered ; while in cutting down the hill on the west of St. Peter's-street, at the back of the Osmaston road, fragments of armour, heads of spears, and several skeletons were met with. Such an elevated and commanding situation so near"], [511, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 481 the ancient road to Repton, formerly the capital of Mercia, would more probably be chosen for a military fortress than Cock-pit-hill, while the street and fields are as much in the neighbourhood of the one position as the other. There can be little doubt that the castle was in possession of the Danes when the town was delivered from the sway of those barbarians by \u00c6thelfleda as we have already mentioned in our General History ; and we think that the castle stood south-west of St. Peter's church, nearly upon the road leading to Repton, long before the London road was made. Mr. Gibson, the editor of Camden, speaks of a. gate or via leading \"west from St. Peter's church, in ancient deeds bearing the name of Castle-gate.\" This gate must have passed close to the site of the house belonging now to Dr. Forester, to the road leading to the royal residence at Repton ; on which road there would necessarily be an entrance of the royal castle. \" Derby ! the pride of Derwent's western bank, Where undulating hills their verdant slopes, Luxuriant, spread ; with lucid brooks between, Flowing through wood and coppice. Southward stood The castle with extensive walls and towers, And lofty battlements o'er moat and mound, Which from the rapid river's parted stream, \u2014 (There, where it breaks in isles the subject mead) \u2014 Extended and embraced the western heights.\" \u00c6thelfleda, a Poem. Under William the Conqueror, the Saxon castles which had fallen into decay were repaired, and many new ones were erected by command of the sovereign and at the pleasure of his Nor- man barons. At such a period the castle of Derby would, undoubtedly, not be wholly neglected, although we do not meet with any direct mention of it during those distracted periods under the Plantagenets, when every castle seemed occasionally to be the seat of feudal power and warfare. Whether it was retained by the crown or bestowed upon the Ferrers, Earls of Derby, is uncertain, but we think that it did not belong to the Ferrers, for when the latter Earls of that family forti- fied their castles in this neighbourhood at the time of the baronial wars in the reigns of John and Henry III. we find the castles of Duffield and Harestan mentioned, but no intimation of any cas- tle at Derby. Harestan, Bolsover and the Peak castles are also frequently spoken of as royal fortresses at the same period, held by the most trusty of the king's friends, without any notice of a castle here which might be supposed to be of considerable importance. If any thing is to be gathered from this total want of information relative to Derby castle, it is that the inhabitants of this town were left more to the peaceable pursuits of their industry than those of other places of similar im- portance. On the confiscation ofthe estates ofthe last Earl Ferrers, his rights in Derby as well as his other property were conferred on the youngest son of Henry III. named Edmund Crouch- back, but the Rev. Mr. Simpson is wrong with respect to a grant of Derby castle. In the peti- tions and suit at law with which the unhappy and imprudent Earl endeavoured to retain his claims, there is no mention of Derby castle. It was, probably, at that period, in ruins, if not entirely dilapidated. Nearly sixty years afterwards, when Edward II. attended the expedition of his favourite, Hugh le Spenser, the younger, in pursuit of his cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster and Derby, and in this town received the submission of Robert de Holand,* the traitorous secre tary ofthe noble Earl, there is no mention of a castle here, which, had it been in a habitable con dition, wotiid undoubtedly have been the royal residence. Monasteries. \u2014 Ofthe ancient monastic establishments in the borough, there seem to have been six. The priory of St. James, which was situate on the Markeaton brook, at St James's lane, was origi nally a small cell or chapel of Cluniac monks attached to the abbey of Bermondsey, near London. This chapel was founded in the Saxon era, and dedicated to St. James. Waltheof, the unfortu- * There is a strange historical error in Pilkington, Simpson and other writers concerning this Robert de Holand. They state him to have been descended from Joan, the daughter of Prince Edmund of Woodstock, the youngest brother of Edward II. The second son of De Holand married this Joan, who was called the Fair Maid of Kent, and in her widowhood she was married to the Black Prince, and became the mother of Richard II. 3 Q"], [512, "482 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER nate nobleman whom the Conqueror caused to be beheaded, and who is said to have been the first who suffered from that mode of execution, gave this chapel or church to the Bermondsey friars. In the time of Henry III. this priory was protected as a poor hospital, and in that of his succes sor it is mentioned as alien, by the name of \" Prioratus Sancti Jacobi de Derby de Aldenna.\" It is stated by Hutton, that, during the wars carried on between Henry V. and the king of France, the subjection ofthe English Cluniac monks to the abbey of Clugni, in that kingdom, was broken, and that the Cluniac monks of Derby were attached to the abbey of Lenton, in Nottinghamshire. There is much confusion in these accounts. We find it mentioned by Prynne that the following entry stands in the records of the monastery of Lylleshull, in Salop \u2014 \"Hospitall Sancti Jacobi apud Derb' pro terris in Blackfordby ijs\" \u2014 to the hospital of St. James at Derby, for lands in Blackfordby, 2s. Before the Reformation, the corporation of the borough paid to the monks of this priory two pounds of wax annually, for the privilege of passing over St. James's bridge. This fact serves to prove the antiquity of that thoroughfare. The present bridge is of modern structure. The priory stood nearly upon the site of the King's Head Inn, and in digging the foundation of the buildings in that neighbourhood, a stone coffin was discovered several years ago, containing a body of prodigious size. There can be little reason to doubt that this priory and its possessions are meant, in the grant subsequent to the Reformation to the Corporation of Derby, by the name of the \" Free Chapel of St. James, with all the lands, &c. thereto belonging.\" The abbey of St. Helen was founded by Robert de Ferrariis, second Earl of Derby, in the reign of king Henry II. and endowed with rents chiefly derived from recent grants from the crown. In the deed of endowment he says, \" I have founded a house of religion at Derby, on the royal dues (infisco regio) by the consent and confirmation of king Stephen, and by the con sent of king Henry, and I have placed an abbot and canons in it.\" He goes on to state that he endows the abbey first with the church of Oakerthorpe and Crich and with a tenth of his rents in Derby, with a third part of the meadow land on each side of the Oddebroc, which he and his father held by hereditary right as heirs of Stephen, Count de Blois, afterwards king ; and six solidat\u0153 of land at Osmanston, and the oratory with burial ground ; and six acres at Hordwica and at Aldwerke ; with a grant in perpetuity of as much wood as a cart can bring from the woods of Duffield and Chaddesden. Shortly afterwards, Hugh, dean of Derby, with the consent of his son Henry (or according to Speed, one Hugh Dean or Dene, a blacksmith, of Derby) gave to Albinus, at that time abbot, and to the canons of St. Helen's, all the lands he then held in Little Derby, for the purpose of building thereon a church and monastery. He bestowed upon them also, the church of St. Peter, in Derby, with its appurtenances. On the confiscation of the property of the Earls of Derby, towards the termination of the reign of Henry III. the advowson ofthe churches held by this monastery was claimed as an escheat to the crown. But in consequence of the grant of Hugh of Derby, the monks of St Helen's had removed to Little Derby or Darley, leaving only an oratory at their former place of residence. Sometime before the year 1261, the priest Nicholas established an hospital at the oratory, consist-"], [513, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 483 ing of certain poor brethren and sisters, governed by a warden and master.* In the taxatio of pope Nicholas, made in the year 1291, we find that the master of St. Helen's held houses in Derby ofthe annual rental of \u00a3l. 6s. 8d. He also held 120 acres of arable land, valued at \u00a34. yearly, with 3| acres of meadow land, worth annually 7_. besides a capital messuage (probably the religious house itself) estimated to be worth is. per annum. The whole amount of these as sessments is \u00a34. 17_. 8d. of which the papal see claimed the tithe or 9_. 9\\d. At the beginning of the last century, when Mr. Woolley wrote the manuscript to which we have already referred, the religious house of St. Helen's had been converted into dwelling houses and good orchards, and an alley or footway called St. Helen's lane, in the middle of the street called St. Helen's. The Rev. Robert Simpson is of opinion that the house was not in existence at the time ofthe Reformation. In 1544, William Berners died seised of a messuage in Derby, called St. Helen's; and in 1585, Sir Godfrey Foljambe also possessed a house in Derby of that name. The ancient site of this monastery is now occupied by the marble and spar works of Mr. Hall. Human bones, with a great quantity of skulls and several skeletons have been discovered in lowering the ground. Some of the skeletons were enclosed in flag-stones placed close together without cement. This spot was undoubtedly the cemetery of the monastery. There was a hospital for leprous persons in Derby, as early as the reign of Henry II. called the Maison de Dieu, or House of God. Its site is uncertain. There was also an old hospital of royal foundation, consisting of a master (whose place was in the gift of the crown) and several leperous brethren, the master of which paid to the abbot of Darley an annual rent of 5s. 6d. Whether the religious house dedicated to St. Leonard was not the same as the Maison de Dieu is useless to enquire. Mr. Davies says, that \"if there were two, one must have stood at the New lands, and the other at St. Mary's bridge,\" and Mr. Simpson, on the authority of Hutton, asserts that \" the place where this house stood is ascertained by an adjoining close, which bears the name of Abbey barns.\" We are much more inclined to credit the manuscript of Mr Woolley, by which \" St. Leonard's, formerly a religious house,\" is placed on the elevation above the Osmaston road ; and this is confirmed by popular tradition, which has given to one of the streets recently built in that neighbourhood, the name of Leonard-street. With respect to the Newlands and the Abbey barns, Mr. Woolley expressly says, that they formerly belonged to Darley abbey. The nunnery of St. Mary de Pratis, or King's Mead, was of the benedictine order, and the dis trict west of the town, still called Nun's-Green, points out its situation. The meadows in this neighbourhood, on the north bank of the Markeaton or Odde-brook, appear to have been known as the King's mead, in former times. This nunnery was founded by the abbot of Darley about the year 1 160. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The abbot of Darley obtained from Wal ter Durdent, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, the superintendance of this nunnery and the con secration ofthe Virgins. Henry III. ordered five pounds to be paid every year by the bailiffs of Nottingham, out of the fee-farm rent of that place, to this convent, in order to procure the prayers of the prioress and her nuns for the soul of his father, king John. In the reign of Edward I. this convent derived annually from sundry tenants in Derby, fourteen pounds, and six marks of silver for the rent of three water mills upon the Odde-brook, and possessed the manors of Aldewerk, Nor manton, Botterleg and Wytunton. The land on which the nunnery was founded, with its garden and curtilage was valued at twenty shillings per annum: and there were also, four carucates of land, comprising sixty acres. In the reign of Edward III. the abbess of St. Mary of Derby paid \u00a330. for license to acquire possession of ten messuages, one mill, four shops, six cottages, fifty acres of land ten acres of meadow, and ten solidated rents with their appurtenances in Derby. The charters of Henry IV. confirm to the abbess and nuns, the payment of one hundred shillings from \u2022 The Rev. Robert Simpson adds, \" in 1271 the master of this hospital is accused of encroaching. ' Juratores di cunt quod magister domus Sancte Helene fecit quoddam fossatum nimis prope viam regiam in longitudine centum pedum et in latitudine duorum pedum.' But this passage is omitted in the Latin of the original roll, as given by him at page 42, although in his translation we find. Also the master of the house of St. Helen's has made a certain ditch too near the highway, in length one hundred feet, and in breadth two feet.\""], [514, "484 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER the town of Nottingham, and grant to them, twenty-seven acres of land with tenements in the Peak forest, together with common pasture in the same forest. It appears from the Records of the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, that in the reign of Henry VI. Isabella de Stanley was prioress of St. Mary's convent in Derby. Against this lady, who was nearly related to the nobleman who espoused the mother of Henry VII. a bill in chan cery was filed by the abbot of Burton. The complainant alleged that for twenty-one years, she had refused to pay certain rents which he demanded as due to him, and that when his bailiff went to distrain, she declared, with great malice, \" Wenes these churles to overlede me, or sue the law agayne me ? They shall not be so hardy, but they shall avye upon their bodies, and be nailed with arrowes : for I am a gentlewoman, comen of the greatest of the Lancashire and Cheshire ; and that they shall know right well.\" In the time of Henry VIII. Derby nunnery was in debt twenty marks. The revenues at the Dissolution were valued according to Dugdale at \u00a318. 6s. 2d. clear, and \u00a321. 18s. 8d. in toto. Mr. Hutton informs us that this religious house of St. Mary originally stood \" one hundred yards north-west of St. Mary's mill (Nuns' mill) and twenty north of the bed of the old brook. The meadow bearing the name ofthe Nuns' close, contains eight or nine acres, and is full ofthe vestiges of that religious foundation.\" The dress of this order was a long black gown which reached to the feet, with sleeves that would admit the body ; a close cap covered the whole head, except the lower part of the face ; it was bound under the chin, and descended upon the breast like a band. Over Aie head hung a black cloth, of the same materials as the gown, pending be low the shoulders. Exclusive of this they wore a cowl. The site of this house was granted by Henry VIII. in 1541, to Francis, Earl of Shrewsbury, who, in the following year, sold it to Thomas Sutton. In 14 Elizabeth, Alan Sutton died and left to his son Thomas the site ofthe priory of St. Mary de Pratis (formerly the nuns of St. Aus tin) King's meadow, Nuns' close and St. Mary's close. These lands afterwards became the pro perty of Sir Simon Degge. Francis Mundy, of Markeaton, esq. owned the site of the nunnery, part of which property he has sold, and several new streets have been erected thereon. 1825, March 2. \" As some workmen were employed in laying out the ground for a street in a field called the Nuns, which has been lately sold by Mr. Mundy as building land, they struck their tools upon a stone coffin. It was not more than two feet below the surface of the ground, and on being opened it was found to contain human bones, which were evidently the skeleton of a female of rather small dimensions. The sinking of the earth had broken this ancient receptacle of what had formerly life, and thought, and beauty, and we regret that no pains were taken to preserve it in the state in which the workmen found it. It was about five feet long, and was lying in a direction due east and west. Several fragments of human bones were found in the im mediate neighbourhood ofthe coffin, and at a little distance were subsequently discovered the re mains of a tesselated pavement. This interesting relic was formed of many coloured tiles, and was about nine feet in length by four in width. The tiles were three inches square, and a part was surrounded by what appeared to be the foundation stones of side and end walls. Several fragments dug up in the vicinity had the appearance of arch stones, as if they had been employed in constructing the door way to the small room, of which the pavement formed the floor. It is therefore probable that this small area had been a bath, but whether it is of Roman or Saxon an tiquity is doubtful. Probably the former has the best claim to it, but the stone coffin is more likely to have been of a much later date. The field where it was found is beyond the boundary of what was formerly called the Nuns' Green, and as there is no doubt that a religious house ex isted in ancient times somewhere in that neighbourhood, it is not improbable that the operations of the labourers may bring to light other relics which may illustrate something more of its history. We hope that the present proprietor of the lands will take proper care to preserve any curiosities which may be found in the subsequent excavations.\"* The Dominican or Black Friars. This convent was founded on or before the year 1292, and \u2022 Derby Mercury."], [515, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 485 dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 21 Edward I. a meadow containing three roods and a half, situate in Derby, was granted to them by Andrew le Jorene, as appears from the following note : \" Non est ad damnum si Rex concedat Magistro Andre\u00e6 le Jorene licentiam dandi Fratribus de Derby j pratum contin' iij rodas et dimid' in Derby.\" In 12 Edward II. a patent was obtained for purchasing ten acres of land for the purpose of enlarging this priory. In 15 Edward III. nine cottages, eight acres of land, one meadow and one croft, situate in the parish of St. Wer burgh, belonged to this house. The friars' preachers paid to the abbot of Darley annually xlvj.9. viija. The revenues of this house were estimated at the time of its suppression at \u00a318. 16s. 2d. clear yearly income. Laurence Fickner, who was then prior, with five friars, surrendered this convent, January 3rd, 1539. In 1543, the site was granted to John Hinde, and in the course of a few years passed in succession to the families of Sharpe, Statham, and Bainbrigge. William Bainbrigge, esq. was possessed of it in 1562. \u2014 Speed's map represents the site of this convent as detached from other buildings, at the skirts of the town, surrounded by an enclosure. About the year 1730, the site was purchased by one of the Crompton family, at which time there was a building consisting of three dwellings about the middle part of the close behind Mr. Crompton 's (now Mr. Mozley's) house. This building was supposed to have been part of the priory. It is conjectured that in the situation of Mr. Mozley's garden there was a place of worship and burial ground. Certain it is that human bones have been found in the neighbourhood of the house ; and that when it was built the foundations were laid with stones collected from the priory. 1 he Rev. Mr. Cantrell, the minister of St. Alkmund's, writing in the month o_*August, 1760, says, \" The friary is lately taken down, and a new house and outward houses are now erected there by Mr. Crompton, who purchased the situation.\" The site of the friary belonged afterwards to the family of Dalton, then to the late Michael Henley, esq. and is now the property and residence of Henry Mozley, esq. The habit of this order was a white robe, which hung to the feet ; an apron of the same, a few inches shorter, girt round the waist ; a black gown which descended to the bottom of the apron ; a short black cloak with a hood ; a fillet of hair surrounded the head, the crown being shorn and always naked, except the monk chose to put up his hood. St. Mary's Chapel.\u2014 The remains of this chapel ranks amongst the most ancient buildings now .xtant. It stands upon the verge of the river, formed a part of the old bridge, and was inter woven in such a manner with it, as to leave little doubt of its having been erected at the same"], [516, "486 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER time. There appears to have been a church in Derby dedicated to the Virgin Mary in very early times, and we think it is not hazarding a very erroneous opinion to pronounce this the same church as was given to the Abbey of Burton, by William the Conqueror. In the reign of Charles II. the Presbyterians made use of this chapel, and about a century ago it was converted into small dwellings. The only remains now in existence are a door case and two window frames, which formed part of the habitation of the late Mr. Thomas Eaton, surgeon. The following item from a paper in All Saints' parish chest is given in the Rev. Robert Simp son's History of Derby : \" Item as concerning the tythe of certein lande in the saide towne of Derbie called the Church lande there, and the ChappeU on the bridge there, the said Arbitrators haveinge hearde the evi dences and proofs on both p'ts fullye and at large, doe arbitrate, decree, and adiudge that the saide Willim Buckley by virtue of any letters patents or grant thereof to him or to any other p'son or p'sons heretofore made, hath not any good or sufficient title unto the same or to anye p'te or p'cell thereof, but that the said Baillies and Burgesses ought quietlie and peaceablie to nave and enjoy the same to them and their successors, as they have held and enjoyed the same by the space of six or seavenscore yeares last past as by good and sufficient proofes and evidences hath been manifested and proved before the said Arbitrators. And therefore the said Arbitrators doe arbitrate, adiudge, &c.\" CHURCHES AND CHAPELS. \" Majestic Pile ! whose towered summit stands Far eminent above all else that rise In Derby's peopled vale ; through many an age, With changing form, but renovated strength, Thou hast maintained thy native site ; and still, (If unprophetic hopes fulfilment gain) Shall other centuries depart and leave Thee Sovereign of the scene !\" Edwards's All Saints' Church. \" The stranger, who wanders through Derby in quest of objects worthy of remark, will find some defects, and more beauties : but when he arrives at All Saints', he arrives at the chief excel lence \u2014 the pride of the place. It stands as a prince among subjects; a giant among dwarfs. Viewed at any distance, or in any attitude, the associated ideas of taste, grandeur and beauty, fas cinate the mind ; the eye is captivated and continually turns to its object, but never tires. Some pride, more sense, and still more judgment must have combined in our forefathers in the con struction of this noble tower : they wrought, and we enjoy the credit of their labour. \"A church in Derby, where the stone is not of a loose texture, will endure much more than a thousand years. As time has worn out one church and one steeple, we may fairly suppose this was erected early in the Saxon government, and is the oldest in Derby, being the only one known to have been rebuilt, St. Werburgh's excepted ; nor is it to be much doubted, as this spot is the most inviting, that the Britons had a temple here.\" (Hutton.) The tower of All Saints' is very justly the boast of Derby : It may be said, according to an ob servation of Mr. Hutton, not only to rank as \" a Prince among subjects\" compared with the buildings in its immediate vicinity, but to maintain a very conspicuous place among similar buildings, taking the more extensive range of the kingdom. The tower of Boston church alone is of a greater height : this however was built one hundred and fifty or two hundred years pre vious, and has an octagonal lanthorn or louvre at the top, to the summit of which from the ground, is said to be 300 feet. With the heights of those few other celebrated towers of paro chial churches to which it alone can be compared, it bears the following proportion :"], [517, ""], [518, "RV.JSligTU gcT \u25a0 S.JTryrr . siuZp* AM, SA-OfTTS GEI UfB-CM.

Magdalene Tower, Oxford 122 A similar parallel cannot, with equal propriety, be drawn with the heights of cathedral churches, as their construction is of a different nature ; having as their highest part the central tower, which rises from the roof, and not, as in most of the instances above given, in one direct elevation from the ground. As it may, however, assist in giving a more correct idea ofthe rela tive altitude of All Saints', we shall just name, that with the exception of those which have spires, the following alone are higher : Lincoln, 288 feet ; Canterbury, 235 ; York, 234 ; Gloucester, 225; Durham, 214; Ely, 210, and Worcester, 196: whilst Bath, which is 162 feet; Wells, 160; Peterborough, 150; Winchester, 133; Exeter, 130; Carlisle, 128; Chester, 127, and Bristol, 127, are lower. But, prominent as it thus stands in its dimensions, it is to the beauty of the outline and pro portion, to the purity of its style, and to the chasteness and elegance of its enrichments, that its chief claim for admiration rests, and which will ever cause it to be looked upon with pleasure, and continue to make it a most distinguished object. A general description will serve to illus trate each of these particulars, and confirm its superior claim to the attention of all lovers of gothic architecture. With regard to its outline, the angle buttresses rising with a bold projection from the ground, form in their gradual ascent to the top, by means of slopes, gables, niches, &c. what is termed the logarithmic curve, in other words, the line or natural sweep made by the trunk of trees. These lose themselves in the four square turrets that rise above the roof, and which are crowned by pin nacles and crockets, and each by a gilt vane. The top of the tower is finished by open battle ments with a small centre turret between each. Its general proportion, compared with the churches before named, has a rather more solid ap pearance, being only about four and a half diameters in height, whilst some of those are four and three quarters, and five diameters. The body of the tower is divided into three stories, of nearly equal heights, by two beautiful lines of octangular and circular tracery, with shields and small battlements above. The lower story on two sides is quite plain, and in the front it has the entrance door with a niche on each side, and a line of circular tracery and shields above, on which rests a window with four divi sions. Each of the four sides of the second story consists of beautiful tracery, having the general feature of a window, but a very small part of which is pierced for light. The upper division forms the belfry, each side of which has a window with three mullions in two heights, filled in with sound boarding, and having surrounding tracery similar to the story below. The bat tlements above, as well as the buttresses, are also richly pannelled with tracery. The whole is in a tolerable good state of preservation, except the doorway, the niches and enrichments of which are a good deal defaced ; and it is to be feared, that unless they are speedily restored, sufficient traces of what they were, will not remain to a future generation. The style is a remarkably chaste specimen of what is generally termed, the Florid, or highly decorated Gothic, or, according to a designation preferred by others, the Gothic of the fifteenth century. The more particular date of its erection, is the latter end of the reign of Henry the Seventh, or the former part of Henry the Eighth, and hence it may be considered as one of the last specimens of this then matured species of architecture in the kingdom ; for after this period a complete stop was put to the erection of ecclesiastical edifices, the art of building in this style was lost, and the Italian mode was gradually introduced. From an inscription of \" young men and maydens\" which still remains on a fascia running round three sides of the tower, it is supposed by some that it was erected to that height by the"], [520, "488 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER contributions of young people of both sexes. By others this is supposed to be merely part of a quotation from the bible ; and this latter opinion is most probably correct, as there are to be found partial scriptural inscriptions on other churches of about the same age. The ancient body of the church was of Gothic architecture, and we regret that we have not been able to discover any description or print of a building that was probably in some measure adapted to this beautiful tower. In the old view of Derby, now in the possession of Mr. Har wood, of St. Peter's-street, the eastern gable of the church body partially appears. It is double, and each part seems to have contained a large gothic window differing from the other in its style of ornament and form. This indicates that one part of the body of the church was more ancient than the other. From such a document it would be presumptuous in us to pretend to surmise any detail of the structure. The modern body attached to this fine relic of gothic proportions is in the style of the Roman doric, and although it must be admitted to be an elegant and chaste design, it is lamentably in congruous with the tower. It was the design of the classical Gibbs, the architect of St. Martin's church, London, and the Radcliffe library, Oxford. It is built of beautiful freestone, the pro duce of the neighbourhood, in the years 1723, 1724 and 1725, and is 130 feet long by 83 feet wide. The present church was opened for public worship November 25th, 1725, when a ser. mon was preached by Dr. Hutchinson, at that time minister, from Psalm cxxii. 1. \" I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord \" The expenses of the erection of this fabric were principally defrayed by voluntary contributions, which were raised by the Doc tor, who not only subscribed \u00a340. but being a man of genteel address, charged himself with raising the whole money, and executing a masterly work without a shilling expense to his parish. It is said he was complete master of the art of begging. The people to whom he applied were not able to keep their money ; it passed from their pockets to his own as if by magic. Wherever he could recollect a person likely to contribute to this desirable work, he made no scruple to visit him at his own expense. He took a journey to London to solicit the benefaction of Thomas Chambers, esq. ancestor of the earl of Exeter, who gave him \u00a3 1 00. Isa stranger passed through Derby, the doctor's bow and his rhetoric were employed in the service of the church. His anxi ety was urgent, and his powers so prevailing, that he seldom failed of success. When the waits fiddled at his door for a Christmas-box, instead of sending them away with a solitary shilling, he invited them in, treated them with a tankard of ale, and persuaded them out of a guinea. He procured five hundred and eighty-nine subscribers, who gave the sum of \u00a33249. H*- 6d. But it appears he could procure a man's name by his eloquence easier than his money ; for fifty-two of the subscribers never paid their sums, amounting to \u00a3137- l6s. 6d. The remaining \u00a33111. 15*. being defective, he procured a brief, which added \u00a3598. 5s. 6d. more. Still, though assiduity was not wanting, money was ; he therefore sold six burying places in the vault for six guineas ; and twelve of the principal seats in the church, by inch of candle, for \u00a34-75. 13*. which were purchased as freeholds by the first inhabitants. \" Pride influences our actions ; nor will it bear contradiction. As the doctor raised the money, he justly expected to have the disposal ; but the parishioners considered themselves neglected, and repeatedly thwarted his measures, till, provoked by reiterated insults, he threw up the man agement, and left them in a labyrinth of their own creating. The result was, a considerable ex pense upon themselves. Some things he intended, were never finished, and some never begun.\"* * The Doctor having occasion to go to town, deputed the Rev. H. Cantrell, then vicar of St. Alkmund's, to the care of his parochial duties during his absence, but on the 1st and 2nd Sundays of the Doctor's absence, Mr. Bag nold, then mayor, with a part of the body corporate, with their mace, &c. attended divine service, and ordered two other clergymen of the town, the Rev. William Chambers, and the Rev. Joshua Winter, to take possession of the pulpit and reading desk, and to perform the duties of the day. Mr. Cantrell, who was in attendance, remonstrated against their proceedings, and produced his authority for that purpose, not only by the Doctor's own letter, but also a letter from his diocesan. These disputes grew warm, and Mr. Bagnold was accused of using improper language and behaviour in so sacred a place, for which he was afterwards prosecuted in the Ecclesiastical Court. Such, how ever, was the ingratitude and ill treatment which the Doctor received from many of his parishioners, that he was at length compelled to relinquish that church, the erection of which had cost him such unwearied exertions, and to take up his residence for the remainder of his life in London. MSS. Notes of Derby."], [521, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 489 1735. \" In this year the steeple of All Saints' was within a few minutes of being consumed bv fire. This was occasioned by a plumber, who, going to close some leaks in the leaden roof made a fire on the top of the steeple, upon a hearth of loose bricks, which he carelessly left unextin guished. Some days elapsed before a smoke was observed issuing from the battlements and it was some time before any one would venture upon the dangerous, but necessary business of ex ploring it. At last, however, this was done; the aspect was dreadful; the roof was melted the sleepers burnt, and the main beam consumed to the very edge of the wall which supported it.\" The steeple contains a good set of ten bells and chimes. This church has, in all probability been twice rebuilt since its original foundation. In ancient writings it is called All Hallows \u25a0 a name which it still retains in the dialect of the common people. The church of All Saints was formerly collegiate, and had seven, and at one time, eight pre bendaries. It is generally supposed the prebendaries of this church resided in the house still designated \" The College,\" and which is situate on the north side of the church. To this college formerly belonged two acres and a half of land, lying in Bridge-croft, in Derby; all manner of tithes of corn, grain, hay, wool, lamb, and all other tithes whatever within the town and fields of Quorndon ; tithes ofthe same articles in Little Eaton ; one messuage, with lands, meadows, and pas tures appertaining to it ; a barn with lands, meadows and pastures ; lands and hereditaments called \" The two small Prebends,\" a messuage and tenement, and one close of land with the appurtenances, all situate in Little Chester ; together with all manner of tithes within the liberty. The revenues of this college were estimated, in 1547, at \u00a339. 12.. yearly income. The college house, which had been the habitation of the canons, passed into lay hands soon after the Reformation. It was some time in the possession of the Allestree family, who sold it to the Goodwins ; it is now by descent from the latter the property of the Assignees of the late Mrs. Hatrel, sister to the late Daniel Parker Coke, esq. There was in this church also the chantry of our Lady, and the guild of the Holy Trinity. Queen Mary, in the first year of her reign, granted one ofthe prebends of All Saints', called The Stone-house Prebend, and two small prebends, with several lands, tithes, &c. which had belong- ed to this college, and certain premises belonging to St. Mary's chantry and Trinity guild, to the Corporation. Directing at the same time, that the bailiff and burgesses should pay \u00a3j 3. 6s. 8d. to two priests, celebrating divine service, and having the cure of souls of the parish church of All Saints. There is now only one vicarage in the gift of the Corporation, who pay the incumbent a stipend of \u00a380. per annum. Archdeacon Walton, who died in 1603, gave \u00a36 per annum to- wards augmenting the incumbent's stipend. The Rev. Charles Stead Hope is the present incum- bent. Hutton says the living is a curacy worth \u00a3130. The interior ofthe church is particularly light, elegant and spacious : the roof is supported by five columns on each side: the windows are large and handsome ; and the symmetry and harmo- nious proportions of the building have a very pleasing effect. At the west end is a spacious organ gallery furnished with an excellent organ. The gallery is wainscotted and of exceeding good workmanship. The east end is separated from that part of the structure appropriated to public worship by a rich open screen work of iron, fabricated by Bakewell, at an expense of \u00a3500. The portion thus cut off from the body of the church is divided into three parts. On the north side is the vestry and the east entrance into the church. Here the corporation meet for the pur- pose of choosing the mayor ; here also the parish meetings are held. The centre part forms a very excellent chancel. The communion-table, altarpiece, and pavement within the communion rails, are of beautiful Derbyshire marble. Over the window is a painting by Raw/inson, repre- senting the appearance ofthe tomb after our Saviour's resurrection, the attendant angel, the visit ofthe pious women, and the sleeping guards, which he presented to the Corporation. Underneath the chancel is a spacious vault, called the Town Vault, in which many families have their places of interment, a small acknowledgment being paid to the corporation for this privilege. The southern side is the dormitory, and contains the monuments ofthe Cavendish family. Underneath this is a spacious vault, in which many of that noble family are interred. In this dormitory is a monument nearly 12 feet high, which stands near the centre, and was erected to the memory of William, Earl of 3 R"], [522, "490 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Devonshire, who died on the 20th of June, 1628 ; and Christian, his Countess, the only daughter of Lord Bruce, of Kinloss, in Scotland. Each side of the monument is open ; and in the middle, under a dome, are whole length figures, in white marble, of the Earl and his Lady, standing upright. The angles on the outside are ornamented with busts of their four children ; William, the eldest, successor to the Earl; Charles, lieutenant-general of horse in the civil wars; Henry, who died young ; and Anne, married to Robert, Lord Rich, son and heir to Robert, Earl of Warwick.

The original building, which was of stone, was taken down, and the present one erected by the late Duke of Devonshire, about the year 1777 ; before his death he gave an additional endowment of __50. per annum. The additional payment took place at Lady-day, 1811. It has been justly remarked that \" whatever convenience the interior of the present structure may now possess, the design of the front but ill accords with the nature of the establishment. The simplicity and modest plainness that should exist in a structure devoted to the purposes of charity, are sacrificed to a style of architecture, that would be more in character when employed in the entrance to a nobleman's park or pleasure grounds.\" St. Alkmund's Church. \u2014 This church is situate at the north end of the town, in Bridge-gate. It is supposed to have been founded as early as the ninth century, in honour of Alkmund (son of Alured, the deposed king of Northumberland) who was slain in battle whilst endeavouring to reinstate his father. Fuller's account is this : \" St. Alkmund (son of Alured, king of Northum- berland) slain in a battle on the behalf of Ethelmund, viceroy of Worcester, pretending to recover lands against Duke Wolstan, who detained them, was therefore reputed Saint and Martyr. It would pose a good scholar to clear his title to the latter, who lost his life in a quarrel of civil concernment : on which account all battles betwixt Christians, such as are slain on one side may lay claim to martyrship. However, it befriendeth his memory that his body, translated (from Lilleshull, in Shropshire) to Derby, was believed to do miracles, being there with great venera tion interred in a church called St. Alkmund, on the right hand as passengers (from the South) go over the bridge, whither the Northern people made many pilgrimages, till discomposed by the Reformation.\" This church is undoubtedly the oldest in Derby, and though built posterior to the Saxon times, it is a very ancient gothic structure, with a square tower and embattled. The architecture ap pears to be the style of the 1 4th century. The spouts are formed of rude carved figures, and the string courses are ornamented with sculptured heads, and other sculptures, as ornaments, m dif ferent parts ofthe building. It consists of middle, north and south aisles : there are galleries on the north and south sides and west end, and the west gallery contains a good organ. In very early times this church was granted to the abbey of Derley, and continued till the dissolution, when Henry the Eighth seized it ; and it rested in the crown till his daughter, Queen Mary, gave"], [534, "500 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER it to the corporation of Derb}', who have the presentation. It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at \u00a3 1 1 . 6s. 8d. This, as Mr. Hutton observes, must have been a mistake, or some of the emoluments were lost ; for in the reign of George the First, the income was only \u00a38. per annum, and divine service was performed once a quarter. Ever since the year 1712, it has enjoyed an endowment bequeathed by a gentleman ofthe name of Goodwin, which Mr. Hutton hands down to us in the following words : \"An old bachelor, of the name of Goodwin, descended from an ancient family in Derby, possessed an estate of \u00a360. a year. ' How will you dispose of your for tune?' says Mr. Cantrill, minister of St. Alkmund's. 'I am at a loss,' replied Goodwin, 'for I have no near relations.' Here was a fine opening for Cantrill to increase his income, and for Goodwin to save his soul, by giving that property to pious uses, which he could keep no longer. Eloquence is seldom wanting to promote our interest. ' My church,' says the parson, ' stands desolate ; instead of being a place of regular worship, it is only a nursery for owls and bats. No act of charity can surpass that of promoting religion.' ' Then I will give \u00a3\\0. per annum to St. Alkmund's at my death,' says Goodwin, ' and the residue at the death of my nephew :' which last happened about the year 1734.\" This estate is situate at Plumley, in the parish of Ecking ton, and at that time produced \u00a360. per annum, but now about \u00a3210. The steeple contains six musical bells. The parish includes Little Chester, Little Eaton, Darley and Quarndon. The income is about \u00a3350. per annum : the vicar is the Rev. Charles Stead Hope, and the curate the Rev. Charles Robert Hope. Arms and Monumental Inscriptions in St. Alkmund's Church.

And, lest any error should be committed, either through design or negligence, let those names that have been in serted during each week in these books, be read openly and distinctly by the minister on each Lord's day, at the close of morning and evening service, and let the day and month be added to each circumstance severally. More over when the inscription of many names shall have filled up any whole page, then we order that such page shall be verified by the subscribing of the names of the minister and churchwardens. The same is to be done in every page of transcriptions from the old paper books, each page to be first carefully collated with the original, nor is the register book to be committed to the custody of any individual, but we order that it be kept in a public chest, and preserved under three locks ; so that no church warden without the minister, nor the minister without both the churchwardens can open it. Lastly, a copy of the inscription of such names through each year must annually be made and transmitted by the churchwardens to the registry of the Bishop of the diocess, and there re ceived without the payment of any fee, and carefully preserved in the archives of the bishop. Whoever shall transgress in any of these particulars, let him be punish ed according to the extent of his transgression. This ca pitulum or constitution, is issued under the letters patent of her royal majesty, ratified, confirmed and established at Westminster, in the fortieth year of her reign, &_. This register was written out by Thomas Swetnam, minister of this church of St. Alkmund, at Derby, accord ing to the ancient copy \u2014 signed, Elias Bradshawe and Ro bert Sleigh, churchwardens, 1598.

Mary Broom, by her will, bearing date 6th April, 1721, devised as follows : \" I leave to my brother, Nathaniel Doughting, all my land, free from debt, for his life, and after his death to that hospital upon Nuns' Green, where I now live, in Derby, which was left by Mr. Edward Large for parsons' widows, and after my brother's death, I leave my land to the care of the same trustees which Mr. Large left for that hospital, viz. Sir John Curzon, of Kedleston, bart. Robert Wilmot of Osmaston, esq. and Councellor Robert Holden, of Aston, esq.\" The property belonging to this charity consisted of the edifice or building called Large's Hos pital, and the gardens and appurtenances belonging to the same, situate upon Nuns' Green, con taining 1 a. 2 r. 2S\\ p. and six closes of land, situate in the parish of St. Werburgh's, containing together 20 a. 3 r. 36 p. also 7 a. 2 r. 9 p. of land in the parish of Alvaston. Within the last few years two exchanges have been made by the trustees. The exchange made in 1823, with Mr. Thraves, of Sandiacre, took place in consequence of a site being required for a new jail for the county of Derby, viz. six acres, at the rate of \u00b1400. per acre. But as the trus tees had no power to sell this land, it was agreed that it should be exchanged under the Act of 1 and 2 George IV. for an estate at Sandiacre, belonging to Mr. Thraves, containing 43 a. 2 r. 26 p. which he agreed to sell for the sum of \u00b12650. The sum which was to be paid by the county for the six acres being of less amount, two other parcels of the charity land were disposed of, one containing 2_)45 square yards, at 2s. 9d. per yard, and the other 482 square yards, at is. 6d. per yard, which were, together with the six acres intended for the use of the jail, conveyed by the deed of 1823 in exchange for the estate of Mr. Thraves.

Hough Peter, of Langley, was buried in that parish in 1689. It is stated on a table of bene factions in All Saints' church, that he gave 20.?. per annum in bread to 20 widows of the borough of Derby. St. John's Church is an elegant structure, erected in a bad situation, on a flat site, on the south bank of the Markeaton brook, in Bridge-street. It is built in a mixed style of gothic architecture prevalent in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, in imitation of one of the public buildings at Cambridge. It was designed by Mr. Francis Goodwin, of London, architect, and built under the direction of Mr. Thomas Mason, of Derby. The contractors were Mr. Thomas Cooper, who has executed the masonry in a very superior style of workmanship ; Messrs. Brid gart, who did the joiners' work, Mr. William Horsley, the plumbing and glazing, Messrs. Weatherhead, Glover and Co. the iron-work, Mr. William Searle, the plastering, and Messrs. Welsh, the painting. The inhabitants subscribed nearly \u00b15000. and the remainder was from the parliamentary fund for building churches. It cost nearly \u00b17500. It is lighted by 22 elegant cast-iron gothic windows, has a double embattlement, and the six projecting buttresses on each side ofthe nave is ornamented with caps and consols. At each corner is an octagonal tower or turret 71 feet 3 inches high. The body of the church is 69 feet 6 inches long, 53 feet wide, and 38 feet 9 inches high, with a chaiicel 20 feet 3 inches by 7 feet 4| inches. It has a gallery on the north and south sides and west end, and is capable of holding 1200 persons. The entrances to"], [551, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 517 the body of the church and galleries are on the north and south sides and the west end. It is a chapel of ease to St. Werburgh's, and the Rev. Philip Gell, M. A. is the curate. St. Peter's Church is situate near the centre of St. Peter's-street, towards the southern extrem ity of the town. It was given in the reign of king Stephen to Derley abbey. In Pope Nicholas's Taxatio, the revenues ofthe church of St. Peter, at Derby, were estimated at \u00b113. 6s: 8d. and the tenths at \u00b11. 6s. 8d. It is a very ancient gothic structure, with a square tower, ornamented pin nacles, and embattled. It is 58 feet by 48 feet, with a chancel 36 feet by 24 feet. This church having galleries all round is calculated to accommodate a large congregation. It has also a good organ in the west gallery. Some years ago the late Mr. Wilson planted ivy round the walls of the church which now nearly covers the building, and gives it a pleasing appearance. In 1819, a piece of land was purchased by the parishioners for the enlargement ofthe church yard from Dr. Forester. This new burying ground is a great acquisition to the parish. Another opportunity now presents itself of further enlarging the church-yard, by purchasing of Mr. Gas coyne the adjoining piece of land. \" Robert Liversage, a dyer, of Derby, founded a chapel in this church in 1530, and ordered di vine service to be celebrated every Friday. Thirteen poor men and women were to be present, each to be rewarded with a silver penny ; as much in those days as would support a frugal per son. The porches, like those of Bethesda, were crowded with people, who waited for the moving of the doors, as the others for that of the water. While the spiritual serjeant beat up for volun teers at a penny advance, recruits would never be wanting. A sufficient congregation was not doubted ; nor their quarrelling for the money. The priest frequently found his hearers in that disorder which his prayers could not rectify ; they frequently fought, but not the good fight of faith ; nor did ill neighbourhood end with Friday. The hearer used to pay the preacher, but here the case was reversed. We learn that no scheme is so likely to fill a church as the silver penny ; that good silver will draw more than good sermons ; that no devotion is valid that is bought with a price ; and that a penny will make a hypocrite.\" \" In the same church was a chantry to St. Mary ; but, as no premium was given for attendance, perhaps the priest sung to the walls.\"* St. Peter's fell in the common ruin, and was vested in the crown till queen Mary granted it to the Corporation. A s the profits of the chantry and chapel were united with the benefice the in come was augmented to \u00b137. 15s. It is a vicarage, in the gift of Messrs. Wright of Bosworth, who are the present impropriators and patrons ofthe vicarage with the chapel at Normanton. The living, in 1 79 1 , was estimated at about \u00b1 1 30. and it is now nearly \u00b1200. per annum. The steeple contains six musical bells.

By a writing, bearing date 3rd of November, 21 Henry VIII. and annexed to the above-men- tioned deed, the said Robert Liversage directed that his feoffees should stand seised of all his lands and tenements, specified in the said deed, after the death of the survivor of himself and his wife, to the fulfilling of his will, as follows : viz. that Ralph Ley, his priest, and his successors, his priests, should receive all the rents and profits of the said premises, and have the letting to farm ofthe same, by the advice of the vicar and churchwardens of St. Peter's, to the intent that the said Ralph and his successors should say mass daily in a chapel which the said Robert Liversage had built within the parish of St. Peter, for the souls of the said Robert and Alice his wife ; and he directed that on Fridays, weekly, the said Ralph and his successors should say mass in the said chapel, and that thirteen poor men and women should be present, and should each receive one silver penny ; and that his yearly obiit should be kept on the anniversary of his death, within the parish church of St. Peter, and certain payments therein specified made to the vicar, the"], [554, "520 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER priests, and others attending at such obiit, all the costs and charges of which he directed should be borne out of the rents and profits of the said premises. An award was made 9th March, 9th of Elizabeth, by Sir James Dyer, knt. Lord Chief Justice of the court of Common Pleas, and Serjeant William Bendloe, Justices of Assize within the county of Derby, between George Liversage, cousin and next heir of Robert Liversage, deceased, on the one part, and Richard Warde and William Buckley, the trustees, on the other part, concerning the right and title of eight messuages, three cottages, one barn, one tenement called a School House, twelve gardens, twenty acres of land, and certain meadows, pastures, &c. being in the town and fields of Derby, and lately the messuages, tenements, &c. of the said Robert Liversage, had been referred, and to which award, being made by indenture, the said George Liversage, Richard Warde, and William Buckley, were made parties, the said arbitrators awarded, and the said George Liversage covenanted with the said Richard Warde and William Buckley, that the said George should quietly suffer the said Richard and William, and their heirs, to hold the said premises without suit or interruption of the said George or his heirs, and that the said George should convey the said premises to the said Richard and William, to the use of them and their heirs ; and the said arbitrators also awarded, and the said Richard Warde and William Buckley, covenanted with the said George Liversage, that they, the said Richard and William, should grant to the said George an annual rent charge of \u00b15. issuing out of the said premises ; and further, that they, their heirs and assigns should, from thenceforth for ever, pay, or cause to be paid, in the parish church of St. Peter, to the vicar and churchwardens of that parish, and their succes sors, to the use and behoof, and to be employed to the sustenance and relief of thirteen poor per sons dwelling in that parish, the yearly sum of \u00b13. and that the overplus of the yearly rents of the premises (the reparations and out rents thereof being paid and allowed) should be paid to the said vicar and churchwardens, and their successors, to be employed and bestowed in godly acts and deeds within the said parish, as by them or the most part of them should be thought meet and convenient for evermore ; and further, that if any doubt or question should arise concerning any of the matters aforesaid, the said parties, their heirs, &c. should abide and perform the award and judgment of such as for the time being should be justices of assize in the said county of Derby, touching the same. An Inquisition was taken at Derby, 25th October, 3 James I. before John Stanhope and others, Commissioners of Charitable Uses, which describes the property and yearly income of the charity at that period. A decree was made in the court of Chancery, 4th March, 9 James I. in a cause in which Robert Bainbrigge was plaintiff, and the then Vicar and Churchwardens of St. Peter's were de fendants, being a suit instituted by the plaintiff as the assignee of George Liversage, to recover the before mentioned rent of \u00b15. a year, granted by the award of Chief Justice Dyer, &c. It is also alleged in the same decree, that the defendants in that suit did not make a just account of the employment of the profits of the lands of this charity to the use of the poor as they ought to do, it was thought meet by the court, and assented to by the defendants, and so ordered and decreed, that from thenceforth, on every Tuesday in Easter week, upon the ringing of a bell, a public account should be made before the parishioners that would attend the same, of the bestow ing of all the rents and profits of the said lands given for charitable uses. It was also ordered by the said decree, that the said rent of \u00b15. a year and all arrearages should forthwith be paid to the plaintiff. By indenture of lease and release, bearing date 26th and 27th March, 1706, Edward Large, as the son and heir of Robert Large, who was the son and heir of Edward Large, conveyed to Wil liam Osborne, vicar of St. Peter's, George Beardsley, and six others, all of the said parish, and their heirs, several messuages, tenements and lands, in Derby, &c. therein particularized, to the use of the old and newly appointed trustees, on trust, to employ the rents and profits of the premises, according to the award of Sir James Dyer and Serjeant Bendloe. Since the execution of this deed, several exchanges have been made. The last appointment of trustees was made by indentures of lease and release, bearing date 5th"], [555, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 521 and 6th of April, 1824. The Rev. Thomas Gisborne, Daniel Parker Coke, Bache Heathcote, Thomas Borough, the Rev. R. R. Ward, vicar of St. Peter's, and Richard Sutton Borrow, esq. as the surviving trustees under the preceding deed of 1795, conveyed the trust property which they and the other trustees had taken under that deed (except a messuage and three cottages, which had been sold to raise money for the redemption of the land tax payable out of the whole of the Liversage estates) to Sir Robert Wilmot, of Chaddesden, bart. Edward Miller Mundy, of Ship- ley, esq. Edward Sacheverell Chandos Pole, of Radbourn, esq. Francis Mundy, of Markeaton, esq. Cockshutt Heathcote, of the Pastures, esq. Richard Forester Forester, M. D. of Derby, esq' William Strutt, of Derby, esq. Joseph Strutt, of Derby, esq. William Evans, of Allestree,' esq.\" Godfrey Meynell, of Langley, esq. and William Newton, of Derby, esq. and their heirs, to the use of all the said parties (except the said Thomas Gisborne and Thomas Borough, who were de- sirous of being discharged from the said trust) and their heirs, upon trust, to pay the rents and profits ofthe said premises to the vicar and churchwardens of the parish of St. Peter, for the time being, to be by them employed for the godly uses and purposes expressed in the before-mention- ed award of Chief Justice Dyer and Serjeant Bendloe. The trust deeds of 1824 contain a particular description of the state of the property at that time. Of the trustees therein mentioned, Daniel Parker Coke, Bache Heathcote, Richard Sutton Barrow, and William Strutt, have died since the date of those deeds. In an entry at the commencement of the book containing minutes of the proceedings of the trustees of this charity, signed by Henry Green, vicar, two churchwardens, and twelve trustees, it is stated, that whereas inconveniences had happened to the trust and trustees, for want of books, and regularly entering their proceedings therein, in order to prevent the like in future and put the management ofthe said charity lands in as pious, prudent and reputable method as they could, according to the intent of the donor, and the writings directing the ordering of the charity, it was, on the l6th of April, 1772, unanimously agreed by the Vicar and Churchwardens of St. Peter's, and the Trustees for the said lands, that the following Rules and Orders should be established, and esteemed binding for the future. These Rules provide, 1st. That a book should be kept for entering the proceedings and orders ofthe Vicar, Church wardens and Trustees. 2nd. That two days' notice should be given by the parish clerk to each trustee, ofthe time and place appointed for a meeting, by the direction ofthe vicar, &c. 3rd. That at such meeting, the majority of the trustees appearing, being one-third at least of the trustees, should be esteemed a majority of the whole, to act and make orders, and to sign such orders in the book, unless such orders should be reversed by a majority of the whole trustees within one month after the making such order. \" 4th. That such orders, and all orders made and signed by a majority of the trustees, vicar, and churchwardens, should be esteemed binding on them and their successors. 5th. That no lease should be made for a longer term than 21 years, or three lives. 6th. That yearly accounts of the disposition of the rents of the charity lands should be entered in the said book. On the 12th of June, 1722, it was ordered that twelve houses should be built at the edge of St. Peter's church-yard for twelve poor people; for building which the trustees allowed the old ma terials ofthe houses then standing and \u00b1120.; and in the following December, twelve poor per sons were placed in these houses, which, at the present time, form the workhouse of St. Peter's parish. It appeared to the Commissioners, appointed in 1826, to look into charitable institutions, neces sary for the welfare of this charity, that the appropriation of its funds (which they state was at that time far from being satisfactory) should be regulated, and a scheme adopted for the future disposal thereof, under the sanction of a court of Equity. 1 648. Out of the impropriate tithes of the parish of Glossop, sequestered from the Earl and Countess of Arundel and Surry, delinquent and recusant, the Committee of Plundered Ministers ordered that \u00b120- should be paid to the minister of All Saints' ; \u00b120. to St. Werburgh's ; \u00b138. to"], [556, "522 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER St. Peter's ; \u00b150. to Chesterfield ; \u00b140. to Mellor ; \u00b150. to Hayfield ; \u00b150. to Brassington ; \u00b140. to Stony Middleton, and \u00b130. to Ockbrook. See document inserted under Glossop. Si. George's Church is situate on the London road : 1 530 square yards of land belonging to the Castle-field's estate were purchased by Mr. Botham, who built the church on speculation, at the cost of about \u00b13500. This person having become a bankrupt, the church is on sale for the benefit of his creditors. It is of gothic architecture ; the extreme length of the building is 92 feet, and the width 52 feet. At the west end is a square gothic tower, the base of which comprises the porch and entrance, and at the west end is a light oriel window, with opaque glass in large plates, de signed and prepared for painting ; by this, and eight side windows, an excellent light is thrown into every part of the interior. It has a gallery on the south and north sides and west end, and is calculated to hold 800 persons. The church-yard completely surrounds it. The Rev. Robert Simpson was the officiating minister. The Unitarian Chapel, situate in the Friar-gate, was the first nonconformist chapel erected in Derby. It is a plain brick building, 45 feet by 40 feet, and 20 feet high, lighted by twenty-four win dows, with a school and vestry-room and burying ground at the back. The interior is handsomely fitted up with pews, and a gallery on the east and west sides and north end, which is ornamented with an excellent organ. Over the pulpit is placed the Arms of William the Third, out of grati tude, as Mr. Hutton informs us, to that monarch for granting them that liberty they had a right to demand. The congregation, in 1697, obtained a lease for 300 years ofthe piece of ground on which the chapel is built, subject to a ground rent of \u00b12. a year. In 1766, Mr. Abraham Crompton left \u00b1200. towards increasing the minister's salary. The late Rev. Edward Higginson took the charge of a very respectable congregation in 1810, and discharged the duties entrusted to him much to his own credit, and to the satisfaction of his hearers, until about a year antecedent to his death, in 1832. The Rev. William Rowe is the present minister. Monumental Inscription in the Unitarian Chapel. tear shalt thou not wipe away from the eye of the wretched.

It is neatly fitted up with pews, and a gallery on the north and south sides and west end, and contains about 800 sittings. Underneath is a large school-room for the use of the scholars who attend the school on Sabbath days, and a small vestry-room. Since the death of Mr. Madeley the congregation has been on the decrease, and not being sufficient to maintain the current expenses of it, has removed to a smaller chapel built by Mr. Robinson, in Xing-street. This chapel is now occupied by the Armenian Methodists, who are seceders from the Wesleyan Methodist congregation. The Roman Catholic Chapel, erected in 1813, is situate in Chapel-street. It is a plain gothic"], [565, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 527 building of stone. A few years ago it was considerably enlarged and furnished with a good organ. It is now calculated to hold 300 persons, and a very respectable congregation attend. The Rev. John Challinor is the priest. The Jerusalem Temple or Swedenborgian Chapel, situate in King-street, was erected by Mr. James Robinson, draper, in 1820, at a cost of upwards of \u00a31000. It is of an oblong octagon form, built of stone, with a portico. It has a gallery on the north end and east and west sides* and is lighted by seventeen windows. Except the quakers, all these chapels have Sunday schools attached to them, which are well attended ; they are supported by the voluntary contributions of the respective congregations. SCHOOLS. The National School was established in 1812, for the education of poor children of both sexes, on the plan of Dr. Bell. The principle of this institution is, that all children attending for the benefit of education shall be required to attend the established church ; the catechisms and creeds of which form a leading part of the instruction. The number of boys at present on the books are 100, and that of girls 130. In 1817, the building in Lodge lane, in which the school was held, was consumed by fire, and the books belonging to the institution were also burnt. The supporters of this school purchased a mill in Bold lane, for which they gave \u00a3700. The lower story is occupied by the boys, and the upper story by the girls. This school is supported by voluntary contributions and a penny a week paid by each scholar. The Rev. John Latham and Mr. John Mozley are the secretaries, Mr. Jay the master, and Misses Simpson and Budworth the mistresses. The Lancastrian School was founded in 1812, for boys only, who are educated on the plan of Mr. Joseph Lancaster. The supporters of this school took part of a mill in Full-street on a short lease, and, on its expiration, the committee built a commodious room 72 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 20 feet high, lighted by ten windows, situate in Orchard-street, at a cost of \u00a32160. Besides the school-room, there is a master's or committee-room, 16 feet long and 12 feet high, and a play ground. There are now 335 boys on the books, who each pay a penny a week for their educa tion, the remainder of the expenses are paid by 105 annual subscribers and voluntary contribu tions, which, in 1 83 1 , amounted to \u00a3 1 46. 3. . 6d. The Rev. James Gawthorne and Mr. S. G. Smith are the secretaries, and Mr. Swiney the master. Since its establishment, up to April 28, 1832, it is stated in the report that 2890 children had been admitted. The debt on the building is de creased to \u00a3505. 3s. 2d. The Mechanics' Institution is held in this school-room, and many public meetings. The National School, in Traffick-street, was established in 1829, by the Rev. Robert Simpson, at a cost of \u00a3350. It is lighted by thirteen windows. There are about 180 boys and 76 girls on the books. The boys are instructed in reading, writing and arithmetic, towards which each scholar pays 3d. a week. They are furnished without further charge with copy and account books, ink, pens, slates and reading books. Mr. William Hadfield is the master. The boys' room is 40 feet by 20 feet, and 10 feet high. The girls' room is of similar dimensions. The girls pay 2d. a week, for which they are taught to sew, read and write by Miss Bowering, the mistress. The School for Girls, in the Old George yard, was established in 1831, on the principle ofthe British and Foreign School Society. It is under the management of a committee of sixteen ladies and seven gentlemen. The number of children on the books is 150, each scholar paying one penny a week, for which they are taught to sew, account and read the scriptures. The school mistress is Miss Brewer. The Infant School, in Siddal's lane, was established in 1827, under the auspices of the Rev. Robert Simpson, on the system of Mr. Wilderspin, for children of from two years to six years of age. The school-room is 50 feet by 24 feet, and about 20 feet high, and is lighted by seven large"], [566, "528 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER windows. The average number of children taught is about 80. The school is supported by an nual subscribers and voluntary contributions and by the 2d. a week paid by each scholar. The mistress of the school is Miss Holbrook. The Infant School, in Mill-street, is a brick building two stories high and lighted by fourteen windows. The rooms are 46 feet by 24 feet. The school was built by subscription, and is supported by annual subscribers and voluntary contributions, and by the 2d. a week paid by each scholar. This school is conducted by Miss Harriet Thornton. There are 189 children of both sexes on the books, about 100 of whom attend the week day school. The Sunday school children belonging to St. John's church are also instructed in these rooms. The Wesleyan Methodist Infant School, in Chapel-street, is attended by 5sj children, who pay 3d. per week. The school room is the property of Mr. Turner, and Miss Anne Melmoth con ducts the school. No reflecting person can entertain a doubt that the Infant School System is calculated to confer great blessings on the rising generation. The children are instructed through the medium of pictures, maps and other ocular representations. The whole range of animal biography, inci dents from history, stories from the Bible, &c. Many of their lessons are in rhyme, and sung or chanted to a number of plain and easy tunes. Even the most formidable of all lessons to an in fant, the learning of the alphabet, is thus invested with a peculiar charm by its being taught in the simple and touching strains of a pretty Scotch air. The importance of Sunday schools to the rising generation, first established in this kingdom by the philanthropic Mr. Raikes, is now almost universally acknowledged. The beneficial results effected by them on the morals of the labouring classes of society is too evident to need a remark. Sunday schools are attached to each of the churches and chapels in this town, and from three to four thousand children receive instruction and are kept under good moral government. Within a quarter of a century many excellent school-rooms have been erected by the voluntary contributions of benevolent individuals, and by the various congregations to which they respectively belong. For these charitable and intellectual uses many thousand pounds have been employed. Thousands and tens of thousands of young men and women, now filling useful situations in society, have re ceived their education at these schools, and have reason to be thankful. Too much cannot be said in their recommendation ; nor should we forget the praise due to those benevolent individuals who devote their time and talents in instructing the children of their poorer neighbours. Those parents who cannot pay for the education of their children, would be blameable indeed if they did not embrace with thankfulness the opportunities thus afforded by a benevolent public. It would be a disgraceful neglect on the part of parents to allow their children to remain ignorant of their duty towards God and their neighbour, when so many fountains of knowledge are opened for their benefit.

It is for the accommodation and relief of the sick and infirm poor. It was at first established, and has been since conducted, upon the most liberal principles ; and the support it has experienced has enabled its conductors to distribute its benefits to an extent peculiarly gratifying to the humane and reflecting mind. Not only all proper objects, without distinction throughout the county are admitted, but it receives all those whom sickness or misfortune may lead to apply for assistance, from whatever quarter they may come, provided they are recommended by a subscriber, and their cases be such as come within the nature and purposes ofthe institution itself, but in case of sudden accident the recommenda tion is dispensed with. This excellent design was formed about the year 1806, when a subscription was opened by the principal inhabitants of the town and county, for erecting a building for the purpose, and a well selected field was purchased of the corporation, at the price of \u00a3200. per acre, on the west side of the London road, in an elevated, airy and dry situation, abounding with excellent water, and accessible by a good road. The design of the building was arranged by William Strutt, esq. F. R. S. according to which, working plans were drawn by Mr. Browne, who superintended the construction of a model, executed with architectural skill and ingenuity. The building is con- structed of beautiful hard and durable whitish stone; of cubical form, with an elevation hand- some, yet simple and unornamented. The building consists of three stories ; the basement story being a little sunk, and surrounded with an area. The middle and principal story is a little ele- vated ; it is approached by steps, and a portico supported by four Doric pillars, of the same stone as that of which the walls of the building are formed, which is a hard compact millstone grit. The upper story is approached by a staircase leading from a spacious hall in the middle of the building, which is lighted by several skylights placed in the dome over the hall in the centre ; this staircase terminates in a gallery, surrounding the interior of the hall on three sides, the cen- tral part being the hall into which the doors of the rooms open. The roof of the central part is drawn into a conical form, terminating in a dome containing six windows, which completely illu minate the hall from the floor of the principal story upwards. The roof of the surrounding rooms is separate from that of the central part, the sloping sides of which terminate in a gutter which 3 Y"], [568, "530 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER surrounds the central roof. Within this central part is an outlet provided with a turncap, for the escape of the foul air, by flues communicating with each room appropriated for the patients. It may be proper here to mention that the gutter which receives the water from the dome and the surrounding roof, has a contrivance to obviate the evils attendant on the gutters being filled with snow and ice, this is effected by covering the gutters with slates elevated by wood slips of about two inches square, with sufficient space between the ends ofthe slates, for the water ofthe melt ed snow to drain into the gutter and run off. The great inconvenience of removing the snow on these occasions, however deep it may be, is by these means entirely removed. The turncap above mentioned would of itself insure a certain degree of ventilation to the rooms ; it is however strongly aided in this effect by another turncap, a short distance from the building, communica ting with it by a subterraneous culvert : the opening from the former one, is by the power of a vane, presented in a direction opposite to the wind ; while the latter is by a similar contrivance always turned to the wind. These being both connected with all the rooms occupied by the pa tients, a current of air is constantly passing through the same. The committee, before the erection began, directed their attention to the means of obtaining the best plan ; and in order to form a correct judgment on the subject, endeavoured to learn from the experience of similar establishments, what were the principal objects to be kept in view in the construction of an edifice of this nature. The result of their enquiries suggested several im provements, which have brought this Infirmary to a degree of perfection unknown to similar establishments. One considerable improvement, and which contributes much to the health and comfort of the patients, is, the construction of two light and spacious rooms (one for each sex) called day (or convalescent) rooms, in which those patients, to whom it may be agreeable, may eat their meals and pass the day, instead of being confined to the same room day and night, as is the usual practice. Another very great improvement, is in the construction of a fever house, a place where relief is administered in case of infectious diseases. Such an establishment as this, has, generally in large towns, been separate from the infirmary ; but here a portion of it is prop erly constructed for the reception, not only of those whose infectious diseases may commence in the hospital, but of those also which may occur elsewhere. The entrance to this fever-house, is on the side of the building directly opposite to the front, and has no internal connexion whatever with the Infirmary. Besides the convalescent rooms, and fever-house, before mentioned, another circumstance in which the plan of this Infirmary surpasses others, is, in providing superior accommodation for patients labouring under acute diseases. In general, the surgical and medical, the acute and chronic diseases, are assembled in one large ward, day and night ; that this must be always pain ful, and in some cases highly prejudicial, cannot be denied. The better accommodation consists in providing for each sex, a set consisting of four small wards, containing one, two, three and four beds respectively, with a water closet, nurse's bed-room and scullery. This enables the medical attendants to separate the diseases from each other, as may best suit their natures ; and the whole of each set of rooms being shut off from the body of the house by one door, these together, pro cure for the patients silence and darkness (which is essential in some cases) as well as every other convenience, in a degree, perhaps, superior to many private houses. This plan, however, might not be eligible, unless it was constructed with another improvement, one which is of great im portance, and which has hitherto been a desideratum in all hospitals ; that is, a cheap and simple, and in every respect unobjectionable method of warming and ventilating effectually in cold weather. Both these have been effected perfectly in this Infirmary. And thus the ventilation will be copious, while, at the same time, the warmth may be regulated at pleasure ; many lives will be preserved, which, owing to a certain state of the air generally pervading hospitals, might have been inevitably lost. Particular attention has been paid to the construction of the water-closets, which, it is said, have not yet been managed so as to be unobjectionable in hospitals ; for if they are ventilated ex ternally, the draught, which should be from the house outwards, is the reverse, especially if the house is warm. A mode of construction has been invented for the occasion, in which every ob-"], [569, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 531 jection of this kind has been done away. A small steam engine has been erected to pump water, wash them, &c. Warm, cold and vapour baths have been constructed ; in short, it is furnished with every con venience, while, in the construction and arrangement of all the offices, every attention has been paid to adapt them to the various purposes with the greatest economy, which reflect the highest credit on the abilities ofthe late William Strutt, esq. F. R. S. who was the principal designer. It was opened on the 4th of June, 1810. The magnitude ofthe building is equal to the accommodation of eighty patients, besides those with infectious diseases. This is doubtless a greater number than are likely at present to want relief at any one time ; but considering the increasing population of the county and town, it can not be considered too large. A statue of \u00c6sculapius, emblematical of the object of the institu tion, modelled by Mr. Coffee, has been placed upon the centre of the dome. The committee have secured about 1 4 acres of the surrounding ground, for the exclusive use of the institution, to prevent in future the too near approach of offensive objects. By the report of the committee, dated the 1st of June, 1809, it appears that the expenditure for land purchased, building the Infirmary, &c. amounted to \u00a3 17,870. 3s. id. From the same paper it also appears that the donations received by the treasurers for the institution, amounted, with their interest, to \u00a331,238. 19_. so that the balance lodged in the different funds, &c. constitu ting the funds ofthe Infirmary, amounts to \u00a313,368. 15..

B. \u2014 Governors who recommend patients at a distance from Derby, are desired to write to the house apothecary, with a short statement of their case drawn up by some physician, surgeon, or apothecary, that some judgment may be form ed whether they are proper objects of the charity ; and likewise to enquire if the beds are all occupied ; an answer to which will be returned stating when they can be admitted. The Self-Supporting, Charitable and Parochial Dispensary was established in August, 1830. The house appropriated for this excellent Institution is in Bridge-gate. The objects of this In stitution are, Firstly, To encourage a provident and independent spirit amongst the working classes, by al lowing such of them, as support themselves without parochial assistance, to become subscribers to this Institution, under the denomination of \" Free Class,\" after the rate of one penny per week for persons above fourteen years of age, and one halfpenny per week, for persons under fourteen years of age ; thereby entitling themselves to medical and surgical aid in case of sickness, and to certain privileges to be enjoyed exclusively by this class. Secondly, To provide medicines and advice for those poor persons, who, though maintaining themselves without parish assistance, are unable to afford the means of subscribing to the Free Class, and who shall receive tickets of recommendation from honorary subscribers. Thirdly, To procure surgical attendance and medicines for poor married women, being free members, during their confinement. Fourthly, To provide medicines and attendance, under certain conditions, for paupers, the overseers of whose parishes are subscribers to this Institution. Lastly, To consult the feelings and promote the comfort ofthe poor, by allowing, to all classes, the choice of being attended by any one of the medical officers of the establishment, who may be most agreeable to them ; and by providing them with medical attendance at their own dwellings, in cases where severe illness renders them unable to attend at the Dispensary. The spirited support that this important Institution has met with does great credit to the feel ings and.character ofthe inhabitants. In 1831, there were two hundred subscribers, whose an nual subscriptions amounted to \u00a3211. 7_ . The donations received from the 1 1 th of August, 1 830 to the 29th of September, 1831, was \u00a3214. 1*. The amount received from the Free Class of sub scribers was \u00a341. 6s. 6d. The utility of this establishment receives a striking illustration from the number of persons who have been cured of almost every kind of disorder of which the hu man frame is liable to, through the assistance which it has afforded. The number thus benefited, from its commencement to October, 1832, has been 2212. The patients admitted, from October, 1831, to October, 1832, was 1420; of this number 1062 were cured, 220 relieved, 135 vaccinated, and 23 were midwifery cases. Two or more surgeons attend at the Dispensary every day : one of them regularly visits such sick poor as cannot personally attend. This charity is conducted by a committee of subscribers, a consulting physician, and eight surgeons. The Duke of Devonshire is President ; the Earl of Burlington, Lord Vernon, Lord Scarsdale, Hon. G.

Ladies' Charity. \u2014 The object of this institution, which was begun in 1815, is the relief of poor married women in child-bed, at their own houses ; who not only receive medical assistance but the use of bed-linen, food, and every other necessary that their situation requires. This in stitution is patronized and chiefly supported by ladies of the first respectability, and its affairs are conducted by a committee. No public building is connected with this charity, as the present mode of relief is considered superior to that afforded by an hospital. The liberality with which its benefits are dispensed, places it among the first charities which distinguish the town of Derby. Society for the Relief of the Families of Distressed Clergymen. \u2014 This society for the relief of the widows and orphans of clergymen, and the families of distressed clergymen, within the dean eries of Derby, Ashbourn, Repington, and Castillary, in the archdeaconry of Derby, was institu ted at Derby, May 17, 1721. The following are the Rules and Orders by which the Society is governed. 1. Widows of clergymen so continuing, and their children unprovided for, or not in a way of providing for themselves, are the persons to be relieved by this charity ; or such clergymen as shall be disabled by age, sickness or infirmity ; and have not sufficient for the necessary support of themselves and family. 2. That the children of necessitous clergymen shall, in the life-time of the said clergymen, be so far deemed ob jects of this charity as to be apprenticed at proper ages, provided there be a sufficient fund remaining for that purpose after the widows and orphans have received their necessary relief. 3. That no widow or orphan be relieved but those of such clergymen as at the time of their death were pos sessed of some Ecclesiastical preferment, or curacy, with in one of the above mentioned deaneries. 4. That no widow or orphan be relieved until a certifi cate be given, and annually repeated, under the hand of the minister or the curate of the parish, or some other neighbouring clergyman, where the widow or orphan re sides ; which certificate shall set forth the circumstances of the person, and that they, he or she be a person of sober life and conversation, and a member of the Church of England ; and if a widow, how many children she hath, and what ages they are of; and also an account of her circumstances. 5. That a day for the annual meeting of the several contributors (both laity and clergy) to this charity be fix- ed upon at the Bishop's or Archdeacon's Visitation, and notice thereof be given in the Derby paper three weeks or a month before the said meeting. 6. That at this meeting three stewards be annually chosen to collect the subscriptions and benefactions to this charity. 7. That each steward shall produce and pay in the several collections, and transcribe an account thereof in a book prepared for that purpose, and subscribe their names to their own collection. 8. That at this meeting applications be delivered in, and orders made for the money collected to be distributed to such petitioners as shall be judged fit objects of the charity, by a majority of the subscribers at the said meeting. 9. That it be the business of the several stewards not only to receive the subscriptions and benefactions already made to this charity, but also to solicit other subscrip tions and benefactions. 10. That the subscriptions and benefactions ofthe no bility and gentry in the support of this charity be most thankfully received. 11. That an annual account of the proceedings of the distribution of this charity, of the names of the several subscribers, and of the sums collected and disposed of, with the balance remaining in hand, be printed and dis tributed to the several benefactors and subscribers, with in one month after the annual meeting.

There have been disputes concerning the position which Henry de Ferrers held in the army of the Conqueror at the period of the invasion ; but from the derivation of the name as well as from the armorial bearings assumed by his descendents, it is generally inferred that he superintended the horse-armourers and far- riers. Whatever was his station he was undoubtedly a man of very superior talents, and that he was a statesman on whose counsels the Conqueror greatly confided, since we find him named as one of the commissioners for the compilation of the Doomsday Book, or general survey of all the manors in the kingdom. That laborious work, if we consider both the circumstances and the time of its execution, as well as the minuteness and accuracy of its details, must ever be considered as a truly astonishing production. We have elsewhere stated the number of manors with which the labours and consels of Henry de Ferrers were rewarJed by his sovereign : ninety-five of these manors were in Derbyshire. Having thus become the sole proprietor of an extensive territory, which, previous to the Conquest, had belonged to many independent Saxon lords, Henry de Ferrers required a central residence, for the maintenance of his power and the pro- tection of his newly acquired lands. He therefore rebuilt Tutbury castle upon so grand, ca- pacious and splendid a scale that some historians were induced to give him the credit of being its first founder. In the immediate vicinity of his castle he founded a priory, which he and his wife, Bertha, richly endowed. The foundation charter of this priory bears the date of 1080, and the church attached to it was finished before 1089 ; f\u00b0r we then find the body ofthe founder was de- posited therein. The beautiful doorway which still presents so attractive an entrance to the parish church of Tutbury, formed a part of the priory, erected under his directions by Norman architects, between the years 1080 and 1089- The following is the inscription which is said to have been carved upon his monument there : \" Hie jacet Henricus de Ferrariis Comes, hujus Ecclesi\u00e6 fundator, Imago nomine cujus Anno milleno Domini quater atque viceno Tutburi\u0153que novo domus est fundata patrono. \"\u25a0Anno 1089, 2<- Gul. Rufi.\" By Bertha, his wife, he had three sons. To his eldest son, Eugenulph, he gave a castle at Duffield (under which place we shall give a genealogical table, and a more particular notice of this distinguished family.) William, his second son, is said to have accompanied Robert, Duke of Normandy, to the Holy land. They died during the life of their father ; and his youngest son, Robert, succeeded to his large estates."], [582, "544 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER 1. Robert de Ferrers, in the third year of the reign of king Stephen, accompanied William Peverel, Earl of Nottingham, and several other nobles, who undertook to repel the invasion of David, king of Scotland. He became the first Earl Ferrers, having been raised to that rank by king Stephen, on account of the valour and conduct displayed by him at the celebrated Battle of the Standard. Of that contest an account will be found in our General History, vol. I. pages 373, 374, but we may venture, without any apology, to add the following anecdote from the His tory of Tutbury, recently published by Sir Oswald Mosley, bart. \" Thurstan, archbishop of York, had recourse to a new mode of encouraging the forces under the command of these nobles: he caused a famous standard to be erected, bearing banners dedicated to St. Peter, St. John and St. Wilfrid, with a portion of the consecrated host thereon ; and his deputy, the bishop of Durham, addressed the army from beneath it. Robert de Ferrers adopted another plan of animating the troops he had brought with him out of Derbyshire, and from his other estates around his castle. He promised a grant of land on the most frequented side of his forest of Needwood to that man who should per form the greatest feats of valour. These methods of encouragement had the desired effect ; the hostile armies met in conflict near North Allerton, and, after an obstinate resistance, the Scotch forces were defeated with great loss. The Derbyshire men were conspicuous for their bravery du ring the battle ; and, upon their return from the campaign, the promised land was claimed by. one Ralph, to whom and his heirs the grant of it was confirmed by Earl Ferrers, under the name of Boscum calumpniatum, Callingwood, or the Claimed Wood.\" Robert, Earl Ferrers, died in 1 139, the year after the memorable contest. His eldest son, Wil liam, known under the appellation of the Earl of Tutbury, was slain at his lodgings in London during his father's life time, and his second son, 2. Robert de Ferrers, succeeded to the title and estate. He styled himself Robert, Earl Fer rers, the younger, and Earl of Nottingham, which latter title he assumed in right of his wife, Margaret, daughter of William Peverel, Earl of Nottingham. He confirmed and enlarged the grants of his predecessors made to the priors of Tutbury. He also founded a priory at Darley, near Derby, and an abbey at Mirevale, in the county of Warwick, where he was buried in the year 1162. , 3. William, his son and successor, being forbidden by Henry II. to use the title of Earl of Nottingham, assumed by his father, joined the king's sons in their rebellion against him, and plundered and burned the town of Nottingham ; but when he saw his castle of Tutbury closely besieged by a strong body of royalists, aided by a band of Welshmen, and the king marching against him with a second army, he thought it best to avert the approaching storm, and submit ted himself to the king at Northampton. He founded a priory at Breedon, co. Leicester, about 1180, and subsequently accompanied Richard C\u0153ur de Lion to the Holy Land, and died at the siege of Acre, in 1191, leaving, by Sibilla de Braose, his wife, four sons. 4. William de Ferrers, his eldest son, greatly extended the estates he inherited from his father. He was created Earl of Derby, by a special charter of king John, dated at Northampton, in the first year of his reign, and the king himself girded him with a sword upon that occasion. By this charter he had a grant of the third penny, arising out of all pleas made before the sheriff of this county. In the same year he received from the crown, upon payment of \u00a370. annually into the exchequer, the manors of Wirksworth and Ashbourn, together with the whole wapentake, which, from that time to the present, have continued to form part of the Honor of Tutbury. In addition to these grants, he also obtained a part of the lands which had belonged to his great grandfather, William Peverel, in the county of Northampton, upon payment of two thousand marks, and releasing to the king all claim to the residue of those estates. The year following the king also surrendered to him the service of William de Greseley and his heirs for his lands at Drakelow, in the county of Derby, which he held by the annual delivery of a bow and quiver full of twelve arrows. He was still further enriched by his relation, the Vidame of Chartres, who left to him certain estates in Leicestershire; and he acquired other lands in the same county, which had been forfeited by the rebellion of Walter de Tibetot and others. In return for these numer ous favours, this Earl proved his fidelity to king John, when the pope had deposed him ; and he"], [583, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY, 545 became surety for the performance of those articles, to which the humbled monarch had been obliged to submit. Of the conduct of this illustrious nobleman, who endeavoured to maintain peace in the king dom during the contests between the barons and king John, we have made mention in our General History. He acquired, by his marriage with Agnes, one of the daughters of the great Ranulph, Earl of Chester, the lands lying between the rivers Ribble and Mersey, which he held by an an nual payment of 40.. and the gift of a goshawk to the king, and it is probably through that ac quisition that a portion of these lands acquired the appellation of West Derby. He died of the gout in the first year of the reign of Henry III. ; at a period when his wisdom and influence were much required by the still distracted state ofthe realm. William de Ferrers, his son, resembled him in disposition and temperament. He was afflicted with the same disease, and being obliged to travel in a horse-litter, he met with a fall which oc casioned his death, in the year 1254. Sir Oswald Mosley, in the history before quoted, assigns (and we doubt not with much justice) to the pacific care and management of these two last Earls, much improvement in the country which surrounded their principal residence at Tutbury. We do not, indeed, find that they abated any ofthe feudal exactions common at that period, but \" then large income had been liberally distributed amongst their numerous vassals and dependants;\" the villages became well peopled and fresh lands were annually brought into cultivation. The neigh buoring wastes and forest lands had been, during the above-mentioned period, reduced by various in closures, some of which had been assarted or grubbed up, and were converted into tillage. But this was not all : the burgage tenures, which were created in the preceding century, \" with a view of obtaining a population adequate to the proper cultivation of these newly-inclosed lands, and the consumption of their produce,\" were greatly increased. \" The inhabitants of these burgages were chiefly confined to trade : at Tutbury they followed that of wool-combing, at Newborough bleach ing, and at Uttoxeter they manufactured iron.\"* Of the next and last Earl of Derby descended from the family of Ferrers, we have had but too much occasion to speak in our General History. He was young and misguided. Instead of pur suing the mild and prudent conduct of his father and grandfather, he took part in the turbulence of the times, and became the victim of his inexperience and imprudence. We cannot, however, condemn him with unmixed severity. He seems to have thought the cause, of which the Earl of Monfort was the leader, the cause of his order, the order ofthe barons in general, and the confis cation of all his estates in favour of the king's son, Edmund, in spite of his appeal to the capitula tion articles of Kenilworth, was undoubtedly an act of royal avarice and injustice.

The personal history of the succeeding Earls of Derby is, consequently, matter for our General History, where the leading incidents of their lives will be found. (See Vol. I. p. 413, &c.) We shall, however, mention in this place some particulars, which we take from Sir Oswald Mosley 's History of Tutbury, the principal residence of these princes, and from various other sources. It may, at the same time, be proper to state that the whole kingdom was then, and had been for nearly a century, the scene of open rapine and injustice. The de- mands of the crown upon the property of the barons, were enormous ; and vast as the estates of many of them were, no possessor could consider himself as a full proprietor.* On the death of a baron or any other opulent freeman, the king took possession of his lands, and the heir was obliged to pay a large compensation before he was permitted to do homage and recover his inheritance. If the heir were a minor, the king retained the estates till his majority ; and when it happened that the heir was a female, she was compelled to marry any person whom the crown might wish to endow with her property. By such means, a large proportion of the landed property of the realm was continually in the hands or at the disposal of the king ; and as this power was grossly abused by Henry III. through his partiality to the relatives of the queen and his other foreign favourites, we are not to be surprised at the repeated efforts made by the barons during his reign to relieve themselves from so severe a state of dependence and oppression. The wars, which the barons waged against the sovereign, were conducted with a want of intelligence and unity of purpose which strongly marks all the public transactions of that unhappy era, and after the barons had made the king and his eldest son their prisoners, had placed the government in the hands of a baronial council, and had laid the foundation of the House of Commons, they became, through jealousy and ignorance, the victims to the restored authority ofthe crown. On being re-instated on his throne, the king, then aged and surrounded by crowds of avaricious favourites, easily con- sented to the confiscation of the estates of the fallen barons, and his second son, Edmund, for whom he had in vain endeavoured, at an immense expense, to acquire the crown ofthe Two Sici- lies, became Earl of Lancaster, Leicester and Derby,t Baron of Monmouth and High Steward of England. This earl resided chiefly in the palace of the Savoy, situate between the cities of Lon- don and Westminster, which had belonged to Peter de Savoy, the uncle of his mother. His first wife was the daughter and heiress of William, Earl of Albemarle, by whom he had no issue. He afterwards espoused Blanch, daughter of the Count d'Artois and queen dowager of Navarre, by whom he had three sons, Thomas, Henry and John. During the reign of his brother, Edward I. he was employed as ambassador to Philip, king of France ; and as his account of this transaction is still extant in a Memorial among the Collection of Public Acts, comprising circumstances highly characteristic of those days of rapine and fraud, we cannot refrain from briefly noticing the most prominent particulars. It appears that in consequence of a quarrel between an English and a Norman seaman, off the coast of Bayonne, in which the latter was killed, hostilities of a very atrocious character were car ried on by the mariners of the two nations, unauthorised and almost unknown to their several governments, for a considerable period, until the people, who inhabited the sea-ports ofthe southern coast of England, instigated by the desire of vengeance, fitted out, at their own expense, a fleet of sixty vessels, and falling in with a French fleet of two hundred ships laden with wine and other commodities, attacked it, and carried the greater part of the ships into port, after having sunk or destroyed the rest. This was an action too important to be overlooked, and, the more so, as this fleet had a body of troops on board.

It is however extremely doubtful whether the title of Earl of Derby was regularly granted to prince Edmund, although he assumed it in taking possession of the estates. Dugdale says that he \"really had nothing of the title of Earl of Derby.\" This seems probable enough ; and although he and his two sons bore it as their second title, yet it was thought necessary to confirm it to his grand-son by royal patent in 1337."], [585, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 547 deceitful, immediately summoned Edward, as a vassal of France, to appear at his court, and there make answer to the complaints brought against him upon this subject. Edward could have no pretence to remonstrate. He had, at the same time, summoned Baliol, whom he had made king of Scotland, and then treated as his vassal, to appear before him and answer to complaints of a far more trifling nature ; and, besides, being anxious not to be interrupted in completing the subju gation of Scotland, he wished to appease the displeasure of the French king without delay. His brother Edmund was sent to Paris, empowered to accede to any reasonable terms that Philip might require. Edmund was accompanied by his wife, who was, by her first husband, mother of Joanna of Navarre, the consort of Philip, and much was expected from her influence over the mind of her daughter. For a time the irritation of the French king's mind seemed to preclude every hope of accommodation, and Edmund was about to return to England when Joanna of Na varre, and Mary of Brabant, the queen dowager of Philip the Hardy, appeared to be persuaded by Blanch that the affair might be amicably arranged through their intervention. The., ladies in duced Edmund to believe that Philip, in reality, aimed at no other satisfaction, but what might jus tify his honour as a sovereign and sustain his authority over his other great vassals. They proposed, therefore, that Edward should make a public surrender of the province of Guienne to Philip as his Liege Lord, in acknowledgment of his offence, while Philip should agree, by a secret treaty, to restore that important territory as soon as this satisfaction to his honour and authority should be completed. Edmund seems to have been startled at this extraordinary proposition. He sent a despatch to his brother, stating his unwillingness to act in a point of such extreme delicacy and danger, but so eager was Edward upon his Scottish enterprize, that the prospect of an uncertain ac quisition seems to have blinded him to an almost certain loss, and Edmund was ordered to accede to the terms proposed. The royal Earl of Lancaster received this command with deep regret, and reluctantly announced to the two queens, and through them to the king of France, that he was authorised to deliver up Guienne, and called upon Philip to swear to the fulfilment of the secret treaty of restoration. Philip made not the least hesitation, but withdrawing into the pri vate chapel of the palace, in the presence of prince Edmund and Blanch his wife, together with her daughter, his own consort, the Queen dowager, the Duke of Burgundy, and the secretary of the English embassy, took his oath to the performance of the secret treaty, and at the same time revoked the summons to king Edward, and gave orders that that revocation should be published. Edmund no longer delayed the public surrender of Guienne, and the Constable of France took possession of that province in the name of his sovereign. The terms insisted upon having thus been fully performed, and a sufficient time having elapsed, Earl Edmund called upon the French king for the execution of the secret treaty. Philip pre tended to be willing to comply with his demand, but intimated that his council would not permit him, and in a few days afterwards Edward was again cited by the peers of France, as a matter of mere form, on the former summons, and not being present, the confiscation of Guienne was de creed by the court. Edward had less reason to be shocked at this duplicity on the part of Philip than to be vexed at suffering himself to be the dupe of a fraudful negociation, more artless and undisguised than those of a similar nature with which he had brought the Scottish nobles into his toils. He does not appear to have been greatly startled at it. He still adhered to the designs he had formed for the reduction of Scotland, and in order to keep Philip from interfering with those designs, he was not unwilling that the French king should employ his arms in retaining Guienne in subjection, for he was well aware that the inhabitants of that province, by their continual revolts, would keep the troops of France in continual activity. He sent to the aid ofthe discontented Gascons a small body 01 forces under the command ofthe Earl of Lincoln, who was in this expedition accompanied by the Earl of Lancaster. The enterprise was unsuccessful, for the Count de Valois being in the field at the head of a numerous army, the two Earls were obliged to retreat into the town of Bayonne, which was instantly besieged by the French ; and during the siege the Earl of Lancaster died. His body was brought to England and deposited in Westminster Abbey. Thomas, second Earl of Lancaster, came into the possession of the titles and immense estates of"], [586, "548 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER his father in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Edward I. On the accession of the weak minded and unhappy Edward II. he showed himself a determined enemy to the lavish folly and favouritism of the court, and headed the confederacy of the barons, by whom the downfall of the infamous Gaveston was effected. In revenge of this constant opposition to the court party, the king was induced to take part in a scheme intended to wound the domestic happiness and the marital honour of his firm and patriotic cousin. The Earl of Lancaster had married Alice de Lacy, the daughter ofthe Earl of Lincoln. She was a lady of much vivacity and beauty, more attached to the manners of a gay licentious court, than to the serious habits of a husband who had devoted himself as the head of that armed baronial opposition, by which alone, in these times, the tyranny and the extortion of the court could be restrained. Under these circumstances, the king and his minions \" encouraged a young voluptuous knight, who was related to the Earl of War ren, to carry off the Countess of Lancaster from a house belonging to her husband at Canford, in Dorsetshire. This project was carried into effect on the Monday before the Ascension, 1317. She was borne off in triumph towards Riegate castle, in Surrey, where the Earl of Surrey then was ; but as the young knight and his companions were passing through the woods at Farnham3 they met with a temporary interruption from a body of priests, who were perambulating some parish boundary, and whom they mistook for persons sent by the Earl of Lancaster to rescue her : in the alarm of the moment they fled, leaving the lady almost alone ; but they soon afterwards re turned, bringing with them a short, deformed and mean looking person, called Richard St. Mar tin, who claimed the lady as his wife, and she was accordingly delivered into his power.\"* In our General History, Vol. I. page 426, some further particulars of this transaction will be found, as well as of other incidents in the life of this Earl of Lancaster. It appears, from Walsingham, that Sir Richard St. Martin, a deformed dwarf, who had been an attendant in the court of the Earl of Lincoln, claimed the Countess, by petition to the Judges, as his lawful wife : asserting in that petition that he had had personal knowledge of her, and that she had betrothed herself to him, before she was contracted to the Earl. On being questioned, the Countess confessed these facts, and the affair, under the influence of the court, and in the absence of the Earl of Lancaster, was decided without any further investigation. The Countess and her immense dowry were ad judged to the deformed claimant. The Earl of Lancaster revenged himself by destroying Sandal castle, near Wakefield, the property of the Earl of Warren ; and the strange infatuation of the king for young Spencer, and his lavish donations to that favourite and his father, having again aroused the indignation of the barons, the royal Earl soon found himself at the head of a powerful confederacy against his sovereign. The avidity of young Spencer in seizing by force of arms a confiscated estate, afforded an occasion of commencing the civil war with which the kingdom was threatened. The barons, after laying waste the territories ofthe Spencers, and part ofthe royal domains, marched into London, and obtained from parliament a bill of attainder and banishment against the favourite and his father. Before these acts wrere carried into execution, the barons dis banded their forces, and the Spencers having upon a slight pretence raised an army and driven the Earl of Hereford with other of the confederates from the borders of Wales, they proceeded with the king to Coventry. The Earl of Lancaster was at Pontefract, and there he was joined by the Earl of Hereford, the Lords John, Mowbray and Clifford, with other barons, while others, fearing the vengeance of the Spencers, made their submission to the king. The Earl of Lancaster had for some time endeavoured to obtain assistance from Scotland, and six letters from leading persons in that kingdom were about this time intercepted, in one of which the Earl of Lancaster was addressed by the title of king Arthur. These were published in Lon don by the command of the king. Lancaster, in the meantime, summoned his vassals and re tainers at Pontefract, and openly declared to them, and to the few barons that adhered to the cause, that he expected re-enforcements from Scotland, under the Earl of Murray and Sir James Douglas. As the Earl of Hereford had brought with him a force of thirty thousand men, he de termined at once to check the progress of young Spencer and the king : with this view \" he arri- \u2022 History of Tutbury, p. 43."], [587, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 549 ved with the whole of his army at his castle of Tutbury, in the beginning of March, 1320 ; having despatched Sir Robert de Holand, upon whom he placed great confidence, to collect re-enforce ments out of the north, with which he was directed to join him as soon as possible.\"* The Earl fortified the long bridge of thirty-six arches, which crosses the river at Burton upon Trent, and the monks who inhabited the abbey of Burton were compelled to assist him with contributions of money and provisions, whilst a multitude of rapacious soldiery were quartered upon the town. On the 6th of March, the king arrived at Caldwell and made an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge his enemies on the bridge. It rained for three days without intermission, but the Earl of Surrey effected a passage over the river some miles lower with his heavy armed troops, so as to be ready to attack the forces ofthe barons in the rear. On the 10th, a tenant ofthe abbey pointed out a passable ford, which was gained by the Earls of Richmond and Pembroke, at the head of three hundred horsemen in complete armour. The king, with his brother, the Earl of Kent, secretly drew off the main body of the army to Walton, where the ford was situate, and while a brave officer, named Robert Waters, made an attack on the bridge, the king's army was conducted through the ford in safety, and, unperceived by the enemy, arrived in the meadows beyond the town. The forces of the Earl of Lancaster were surprised, and fled into the town, which, in their state of desperation and want of discipline, they set on fire. They then sought refuge at Tut bury, and in the action Roger d'Ammory, one of the confederate barons, received a mortal wound. No sooner had the Earl of Lancaster reached his castle, than he received the unwelcome intelli gence ofthe defection of Sir Robert de Holand, who surrendered himself to the king at Derby, where, it appears, Edward had retired while the younger Spencer prosecuted the war. Unpre pared to sustain a regular siege at Tutbury, Lancaster determined to retreat to Pontefract, and to proceed, if possible, by Dunstanburgh, in Northumberland, to the borders of Scotland. A con siderable quantity of Scotch coins had been forwarded to Tutbury for the payment ofthe soldiers whom his allies had promised to send to his aid. These, with a large amount of Flemish and Eno-lish coin, were intrusted to the care of Leicester, his treasurer. The celerity of the king's troops broke through his arrangements. The military chest, with all its contents, was lost in the passage of the Dove. Leicester never returned to recover the treasure. Successive floods soon deposited above it a deep bed of sand and gravel. After a lapse of five centuries, upwards of three hundred thousand of the coins which the chest contained, were, in the month of June, 1831 t recovered from the bed of the river by the astonished inhabitants of Tutbury and its vicinity. On entering the castle of Tutbury, the king, at the instigation of his favourite, sent letters to the sheriff of the counties of Derby and Nottingham, denouncing the Earl and his confederates as rebels and traitors, and similar letters were sent to the Bishop of Durham and the Justice of Ches ter. The Earls of Kent and Surrey pursued the fugitives, and the king, having rested five days at Tutbury, proceeded to Doncaster, where, upon his arrival, on the 18th of March, he was grat ified with the intelligence of the Earl's capture, and the entire suppression of the rebellion. The Earl, on arriving at Pontefract, was urged by the confederates to precipitate his retreat to wards the borders of Scotland. At Boroughbridge they were encountered by a formidable force under Sir Simon de Ward, the governor of York, and Sir Andrew de Harclay, the governor of Carlisle. In attempting to force the passage of the bridge, the Earl of Hereford received a mortal wound from a Welch soldier, and the Earl of Lancaster, incapable of rallying his forces, was taken prisoner, together with ninety-five of his barons and knights. This took place on the 15th of March, and the Earl was conveyed to Pontefract, where he arrived on the 2 1st of the same month. Without further delay Edward summoned a court martial or council of his attendant barons, and without the regular forms of even that arbitrary species of tribunal being preserved, \u25a0 See Sir Oswald Mosley's History of Tutbury, page 47, and the following account ofthe transactions at that place to the execution of the Earl of Lancaster is abridged from the same work. f See accounts of this discovery in the Derby Mercury and Derby Reporter of that period. Many specimens of the coins are now in the possession of the curious in this and the neighbouring counties."], [588, "550 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Lancaster was condemned to be drawn, hanged and beheaded. On account of the royal descent of the condemned Earl, the ignominious part of the sentence was remitted, but in restricting his punishment to the loss of his head, the malignant cowardice of Edward and his minion, prompted them to add insult and mockery to the severe sufferings he had already undergone. Mounted on a lean horse, and clothed in mean apparel, the condemned Earl was led to the place of execution amidst the shouts of a hired rabble, who derided him with the title of ' King Arthur,' a name which had been assumed in the correspondence with his Scotch allies. The precise day on which he suffered is doubtful, but it is probable that the sentence was carried into immediate effect, and that he was put to death either on the 22nd or 23rd of March. The king was not satisfied with his death alone, but caused the greater part of his adherents to be executed at various places in the kingdom ; so that more noble blood is reported to have been shed upon this occasion, than upon any other since the Norman Conquest.* It is difficult, and perhaps, improper, to attempt to delineate the character of one, who, in times so unlike the present, was the most prominent personage in the affairs of his country. His con duct took its external colouring from his position, and it requires much reflexion as well as an in timate acquaintance with all the features of that unsettled and violent period, to comprehend that position with any degree of correctness. Hume, with unmitigated severity, accuses Lancaster of violence, turbulence and hypocrisy, while he says of Edward II. that he had no vice, and that it is difficult to imagine a man more innocent and inoffensive. Such extravagant touches in his political pictures are as unworthy of the historian as they are of the philosopher. The worthy Baronet, also, to whose interesting History of Tutbury we have been so much indebted, has, we apprehend, scarcely contemplated with sufficient consideration the situation in which this unhappy prince was placed, when he says of him, that \" he was turbulent in disposition, but feeble in exe cution : fond of plotting, but irresolute in acting : his influence induced many to support his schemes, but his incapacity involved all such as did so in irretrievable ruin.\"+ For our own part we are content to take the key to Lancaster's public principles from the death-bed address, in which, according to Walsingham, his father-in-law, the Earl of Lincoln, adjured him \" not to abandon the Church and the people of England to the mercy of popes and kings ;\" and to take his general conduct with an impression of the delicacy of his situation as a prince of the blood, and of the instability, jealousy and turbulence of many of the barons with whom he endeavoured to act. The possessions of the Earl were immediately seized and consigned to the custody of Roger Beler, of Kirkby Belers, in Leicestershire, but the troubles which the favourite of the weak minded Edward had brought upon the kingdom were not terminated by the execution of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. A new and more powerful confederacy was formed, in which queen Isabella, after sustaining repeated indignities from the younger Spencer, took the lead ; and being directed in her counsels by Earl Mortimer, subsequently but too notorious as her paramour, landed with a body of Flemish troops on the English coast. She was joined by the Earl of Kent, brother to the king, and by Henry, brother to the late Earl Thomas, who was executed at Pontefract. The king soon fell into the hands of this powerful confederacy, his favourites were executed, and after a long imprisonment, he expiated his folly by a cruel death.J Statistical accounts of expenses at various periods are always valuable to those whose researches have useful knowledge for their object, and are sometimes amusing to the general reader. The author of the History of Tutbury gives a statement of the domestic expenses of the second Earl of Lancaster during the year 1313, as furnished by Henry Leicester, the treasurer of that prince, which we take the liberty to extract. In calculating the present value of that expenditure, it must not only be considered that an ounce of silver was at that period only a -third of its present nominal value in coin, but that a quarter of oats (See History of Tutbury, p. Qi.) might be then bought for four-fifths of an ounce of silver, while at the present time, oats, on an averao-e cost four and a half ounces per quarter. If, therefore, the price of provisions, as we, think it fairly * Sir Oswald Mosley's History of Tutbury. \u2022(\u25a0 Ibid. % See the General History, Vol. I. p. 434."], [589, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 551 ought, is to be estimated by the price of oats, the corn then generally in use, the sum of twenty two thousand pounds sterling, in the calculation of Sir Oswald Mosley, will be raised to the enor- mous sum of \u00a3123,750. \u00a3. s. d.

In 1327, the attainder of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, was removed, and his brother Henry, the third Earl, took possession ofthe estates. He was a high minded prince, and being disgusted with the queen and Mortimer, refused to attend at the parliament held by them at Salisbury in the name of Edward III. then a minor. On this account, in the usual ferocious spirit of the times, his lands in the vicinity of Leicester were ravaged for eight days successively. Upon the approach of the Earl at the head of his military tenantry, the marauders dispersed, and the affair was adjusted. His principal residence was the castle of Leicester, where he founded a hospital. He died in 1345, and was buried with princely honours, in the chapel attached to that hospital. By his wife Maud, daughter and heiress of Sir Patrick Chaworth, of Kidwelly, he left one son. Henry, the fourth Earl of Lancaster, was engaged in the wars of Guienne, at the time of his father's death.* He had been created Earl of Derby during his father's life time, in the eleventh year of Edward III. On the death of Alice, wife of his uncle Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who died in 1348, her immense possessions devolved upon him.

On the 6th of March, 1351, he was created Duke of Lancaster, being the first English subject, not the son of a king, on whom the title of Duke had hitherto been conferred. He was esteemed one of the greatest captains of that warlike age, and was sent by Edward III to deliver Guienne and the neighbouring provinces from the power of France, in which expedition he was ably assisted by Sir Walter Manny and other eminent soldiers. His last enterprise was the siege of Rennes, in Britanny. He died of the plague at Leicester, on the 24th of March, 136l. He left issue by Isabella, his wife, daughter to Henry Lord Beaumont, two daughters the eldest of whom, named Maud, married, first Ralph, son and heir to Lord Stafford; and secondly, WiUiam, Earl of Hainault and Duke of Zealand ; but she died without issue. His second daughter, Blanch, became the wife of John of Gaunt, or Ghent, the fourth son of Ed ward III. created Earl of Richmond and Duke of Lancaster. John of Gaunt was twenty years of age when he espoused Blanch, the youngest daughter of the late Henry, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Derby. She died in 1 369, of the great pestilence that then prevailed, and was buried in the cathedral of St. Paul's, in London. Some years pre vious to her death his celebrated attachment to Catherine de Roet, one of the attendants on the Duchess, had commenced. This young lady was a native of Hainault, and by the influence of her patroness, Catherine was betrothed to Sir Otes Swynford, and is accordingly known generally by the name of Catherine Swynford, while her sister espoused the poet Chaucer. By Blanch he had one son, who became King of England, by the title of Henry IV. and two daughters. Notwith standing his devoted attachment to his fair mistress, the Duke of Lancaster, ambitious of con tending for the crown of Castile, espoused Constance, the eldest daughter of Peter the Cruel, about two years after the death of Blanch ; his younger brother, the Earl of Cambridge, at the same time, marrying Isabella, the youngest daughter ofthe same monarch. The Duke of Lan caster had previously joined his brother, the Black Prince, at Cognac, with a strong body of men which he brought from Bourdeaux, and was with that heroic prince at the siege and the taking of Limoges, by storm, after undermining and blowing up part ofthe wall. The following incident from Froissart's Chronicles, as it relates an action ofthe Duke of Lancaster, and is otherwise cha racteristic of the period, may be worth the attention of our readers. \" There was not that day in the city of Limoges any heart so hardened, or that had any sense of religion, who did not deeply bewail the unfortunate events passing before their eyes ; for upwards of three thousand men, women and children were put to death that day. God have mercy on their souls ! for they were veritable martyrs. \u2014 A company of English, in entering the town, hastened to the palace of the bishop, whom they there found and took prisoner, carrying him, without any regard to his dig nity, to the Prince of Wales, who, eying him indignantly, told him that his head should be cut off, and ordered him out of his presence. \u2014 We will now speak of those knights who were in the town, Sir John de Villemur, Sir Hugh de la Roche, and Roger de Beaufort, son to the Count de Beaufort, governor of the city. When they perceived the tribulation that was overpowering them, they said ; ' We shall be all slain for a certainty, if we do not gallantly defend ourselves : let us, therefore, sell our lives as dearly as good knights ought to do.' Upon this, Sir John de Villemur said to Roger de Beaufort, ' You must be knighted.' Roger replied, ' Sir, I have not as yet signalized myself sufficiently for that honour, but I thank you much for your good opinion in suggesting it to me.' No more was said, for they had not time to hold further conversation. \u2014 They collected in a body, and placing themselves before an old wall, Sir John de Villemur and Sir Hugh de la Roche displayed their banners, and drew up in good order. They might be in the whole, about fourscore. \u2014 The Duke of Lancaster was engaged for a long time with Sir John de Villemur, who was a hardy knight, strong and well made. The Earl of Cambridge singled out Sir Hugh de la Roche1, and t}ie Earl of Pembroke, Roger de Beaufort, who was but a simple squire. These three Frenchmen did many valorous deeds of arms, as all allowed, and ill did it betide those who approached too near. The prince, coming that way, in his carriage, looked on the combat with great pleasure, and enjoyed it so much that his heart was softened and his anger appeased. After the combat had lasted a considerable time, the Frenchmen, with one accord,"], [591, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 553 viewing their swords, said, ' My lords, we are yours : you have vanquished us : therefore act ac cording to the law of arms.' \u2014 ' By God,' replied the Duke of I ancaster, ' Sir John, we do not in tend otherwise, and we accept you, as our prisoners.' \u2014 Thus I am informed were these three knights taken.\" On the retirement ofthe Black Prince from the government of Aquitaine, full of grief for the loss of his eldest son, and weighed down by an incurable disease, he committed his charge to the hands of the Duke of Lancaster. After the departure of the prince, the town and castle of Mont paon were besieged and taken by the Duke, but he soon afterwards broke up his camp, disband ed his army, and retired to Bordeaux. While he remained in that city, the carriage of the Spanish princess was proposed to him by the Gascon barons, in concert with Sir Guiscard d'Angle^ and he in a short time married the lady Constance. Alarmed at this union, Henry of Castile, then in possession ofthe throne, made a league with the French king, for the defence of his territories. At the Michaelmas of the same year (1372) the Duke, who assumed the title of King of Castile and Leon, returned with his consort to England. On the occasion of these nup tials, medals were struck of very great elegance considering the state of the arts at the close of the fourteenth century.* The Duke of Lancaster was more famous for his princely munificence and the influence of his wealth and elevated station, than for his military conduct. As the English affairs were rapidly declining in France, and as his heroic brother, the Black Prince, sinking under an incurable dis ease, was approaching his end, Lancaster was entrusted with one of those expeditions, by which a falling cause was endeavoured to be retrieved with a great display of courage and sacrifice of blood, but without the attainment of any definite object being clearly in the view of those who plan ned the enterprise. Early in the year 1 373, he landed at Calais at the head of a large army, and accompanied by the Earls of Warwick, Stafford and Suffolk, with the barons De la Pole, Basset, Roos, and a large train of nobility, knights and squires. He was likewise attended by the Duke of Britanny. The army proceeded, in compact order, past Montreuil, Bray-sur-Somme and along the banks of that river ; and, at Robemont, they fell in with a skirmishing party ofthe French, com manded by the Sieur de Boursiers, who completely defeated one of the advanced divisions, before the main body could come to their assistance ; and shortly afterwards, in a sally of the French, under the same commander, a great number of the English were slain and made prisoners. The army nevertheless continued its march, and halting in the valleys below Laon, committed great ravages in the neighbourhood, but on entering the Soissonnois they fell in with an ambush, and a very large number of their knights and squires were taken or slain. In the list given by Frois sart, we find the names of John Meynil, John Flamstead and Robert Audley, who undoubtedly belonged to families connected with Derbyshire. Before the main body could arrive the skirmish was at an end, and the French, with their allies, the Burgundians, had quitted the field. It was the policy ofthe enemy to avoid a general engagement, ancl the Duke of Lancaster, almost daily assailed by light troops and skirmishing parties, arrived at Bourdeaux about Christmas, with a harassed army which scarcely amounted to half the number of troops, with which, six months be fore, he had left Calais. The Duke was shortly afterwards recalled to England, to superintend the government of his * One of these very curious medels is now in the possession of Godfrey Meynell, esq. of Meynell Langley, whose ancestors have had it for two centuries ; and the traditionary account of it in the family is, that it was found at Tut bury castle. Mr. Francis Meynell, a younger brother of Godfrey Meynell, esq. of Willington, in the county of Derby, purchased an estate at Anslow, in the parish of Rolleston, about 1630, upon which he and his posterity resided for three generations ; he was the first modern possessor of this medal, and as he died in 1683, it must have been dis covered by him previous to that period. On the front side it exhibits a representation of the Duke of Lancaster, with a wreath of roses upon his head, his left hand resting on the bible, whilst his right hand clasps that of his royal bride ; she wears a crown upon her head, which, as queen of Castile and Leon, she was justly entitled to; above them may be seen a radiated sun, and round the margin the following legend : \"Jungimus optatas sub amicof\u0153dere dexlras.\" On the reverse, within a circle of roses, \" Uxor Casta est Rosa suavis ,-\" and round the margin, \" Sicut Sol oriens Dei, sic Mulier bona Domus ejus Ornamentum.\" It is formed of a mixed metal, and is certainly one ofthe earliest modern medals extant.

The administration of the Duke of Lancaster was not popular. He could not bear the pride and arrogance ofthe clergy, and to show his contempt of them he abetted Wickliffe and his followers, who in their writings and sermons were then publicly proving that the lives and doctrines ofthe clergy were irreconcilable with the scriptures. The clerical body, in their turn, excited the lower order of the people against the royal Duke. Wickliffe, being cited to appear before a synod at St. Paul's Cathedral, in 1377, was protected by the Duke of Lancaster and the Earl Marshal, Lord Percy. The Bishop of London, irritated at this circumstance, reproached the Earl Marshal, with the crime of abetting heresy, and his anger was still farther increased when the Duke of Lancaster called out to Wickliffe to be seated in the presence of his right reverend examinants. The common people, who had flocked into the cathedral, were stirred up by the priests and other attendants on the episcopal dignitaries, to resent this insult to the established clergy, and it was with difficulty that the Duke of Lancaster and the Earl Marshal escaped, and carried off Wickliffe with them, by water, to Richmond. On the accession of Richard II. then eleven years of age, a council to conduct the affairs of government was appointed by parliament, and the king's person was entrusted chieflv to the care of Lancaster, who, in fact, exercised the authority of regent.* The jealousies of his brothers, and particularly of the bishops, induced him to seek a less invidious situation, and in 1378, he under- took the restoration of the Duke of Britanny, who then resided in England, to his dominions. By the information he had received, he was led to expect that several towns, together with St. Malo, an important maritime fortress, would surrender to him on the first appearance of a suffi- cient force. A large army was raised, and he embarked at Southampton, attended by numerous barons. After a favourable voyage, he landed, and found that the inhabitants were too much awed by the French garrison ofthe place to deliver it into his hands. He was therefore compel- led to lay siege to it, and was proceeding with his military operation, when Du Guesclin, the con- stable of France, appeared at the head of a large body of newly raised forces, with a determina- tion to raise the siege. Lancaster was sensible that the success of his expedition rested upon a battle, in which, from the superiority of his troops, he might calculate upon victory, but he was not skilful enough to force the wary Du Guesclin, who was the best tactician of that age, into so hazardous an engagement. The Duke of Lancaster, perceiving that his provisions diminished, that his foraging parties were intercepted bj%is active adversary, and that his men were sinking under toil and disease, while the garrison received continual supplies by sea, re-embarked his men and returned to England. On his retreat, the castle of Arnay, the only place in the pro- vince that still adhered to the Duke of Britanny, surrendered to the French crown. It may easily be imagined that the failure of this expensive expedition did not add either to the popularity or influence of Lancaster. Neither the royal Duke, nor his brothers, seem ever to have gained the confidence and respect of the people and the Commons' House of Parliament, which at the commencement ofthe reign of Richard II. had, for the first time, chosen a speaker and assumed an independence of the peers, to which it had not previously aspired, had shown a mistrust of the princes and the government, by voting that the money designed for the payment of troops and seamen and for other charges of the protracted war, should be consigned to the hands of two emi nent merchants, aldermen of London, named Philpot and Walworth. The Duke of Lancaster greatly resented this caution ofthe parliament, as he was desirous of employing no small share of these supplies in an expedition for the acquirement of the kingdom of Castile, the crown of which he claimed in right of his wife. The wars of Edward III. had tended greatly to impoverish the barons and great landowners ; and the agricultural population, who were still in a condition of the most abject vassallage, were reduced to the severest distress. These long wars had, at the same time, afforded a partial yet an animating stimulus to trade. The money expended in arms and military clothing and the transport of troops, had fallen into the possession of the manufac turers and merchants of that period, and had opened advantageous communications with the com mercial towns of Flanders. London advanced in opulence, and some of her citizens vied with * Hume."], [593, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 555 the nobility in splendour, but the bulk of the community was every where wretched and depra ved, and many dissolute and ruined soldiers of rank were known to be connected with bands of depredators, and yet enjoyed the countenance of the court. Such was the condition of the coun try when the parliament, urged by the demands of the council of government, whom the Duke of Lancaster had persuaded to assist his designs on Castile by aiding the king of Portugal, with whom the reigning sovereign of Castile was at war, laid a poll-tax upon the people at large. This tax was farmed and collected by certain Flemish money-dealers, who were rigorous in its exac tion. One of these collectors having demanded from a man, named Walter, a tiler of Deptford, in Kent, the sum of three groats, on account of one of his daughters, was told by the father, that she was not of age. On this the collector seized the maiden, and attempted to acquire an inde cent confirmation of his claim. The feelings of the father were roused, and with the mallet or hammer in his hand, he instantly struck the ruffian on the head and dashed out life brains. This action, applauded by the tiler's neighbours, called forth the discontent of the labouring classes, that had been long ready to vent itself in open acts of violence. Kent and the neighbouring counties as far as Lincoln in one direction, and to the west of Sussex in another, flew to arms, and Wat, the tiler, in a few days was at the head of a hundred thousand men, with whom he marched directly to London. The Duke of Lancaster was extremely obnoxious to the populace, who regarded him not only as the immediate origin of this oppressive and impolitic tax, but as having, by his arrogance and wasteful plans, lavished away the public grants, and exposed the coasts of the kingdom to the ravages of the French and Scotch pirates. The royal Duke was then in Scotland negociating a truce, while the preparations for the expedition to Portugal on his ac count were carried on as fast as money could be procured. Wat, the tiler, was accompanied by a priest named John Ball, who preached to his followers the perfect equality of mankind, and divisions of his forces were led by Jack Straw, William Wraw and other persons of the lowest rank of society. On arriving at Blackheath, these insur gents were met by a messenger from the government, who, in the name of the king, demanded why they were thus embodied and in arms. Wat, the tiler, replied, that they would communi cate their wishes to none but the king in person. They then moved on, and possessed themselves of the borough of Southwark ; and the gates of the city of London, upon the bridge, being open ed for them by the populace, they rushed into the metropolis. On their entrance they proclaim ed that their sole intentions were to redress the grievances and to punish the traitors of the realm. It was not to be expected that so large a body of rude and undisciplined men would be restrain ed from outrages, but it does not appear that their ravages extended beyond their quartering themselves tumultuously upon the inhabitants, until the London populace incited them to attack the palace ofthe Duke of Lancaster, called the Savoy, a mansion, which, as we have before ob served, formerly belonged to Edmund, the son of king Henry III. This palace, both externally and internally, is represented to have been an elegant specimen of the splendid character of the architecture and decorations of that period, when costliness supplied the deficiencies of taste. The depredations committed by the infuriated populace were excessive, but with a firmness of in tegrity, not altogether unusual, when the great body of the people are called upon to act upon a sense of political grievance, and when, in the midst of their violence, they continue to aim at en forcing some amendment of their social condition, they abstained from plunder, and would not permit a single individual to enrich himself with the jewels, plate and other valuables, which were scattered on all sides of them.* Every thing was consigned to the flames, and what the flames rejected was thrown into the Thames. One of their party who endeavoured to secrete* a piece of plate in his bosom, was hurled, together with his booty, into the part of the building where the fire raged with the greatest violence. They came, they said, to punish their oppressors and acquire the honest means of subsisting with their families, by their labour, and not as plun derers. There have been proofs of this motive of action among an excited people even in our own tunes, and could it be sustained and correctly directed, bad governments alone would have \" Sir Oswald Mosley's History of Tutbury."], [594, "556 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER cause to dread the violence of an assembled people. It gives way almost always, however, in large and opulent cities, to the brutish greediness, the desire of intoxication and all the worst pas sions of a predatory rabble, over whom the more principled portion of the populace, in a very short time, lose all authority. The Duke's cellars contained abundance of choice wines, and thirty-two of these depredators drank of it to such excess, that they were buried in the ruins.* Their voices and cries are said to have been heard during seven days afterwards, but, in the con fusion that prevailed, nobody went to their relief. Part of the Temple with many rolls of statutes and records, was consumed, and several houses of the judges and principal citizens shared the same fate. The unhappy Flemings who had undertaken the collection ofthe poll-tax were mur dered without hesitation, and no sanctuary was sufficient to screen them from popular vengeance. Having thus spread terror around them, Jack Straw and other leaders, with sixty thousand of the men from Essex and from the districts north ofthe Thames, withdrew to Mile-End-Green, where they encamped and listened to overtures made them in the name of the king and council. The Essex men, in particular, obtained an emancipation from all villanage, ancl a free pardon for all offences committed during the insurrection, and withdrew to their homes.t Wat, the tiler, not satisfied with these terms, persisted in his determination to negociate with the king alone, seized the gates ofthe tower, and in forcing his entrance into that fortress, Sudbury, archbishop of Can terbury and Chancellor, and Sir Robert Hales, the treasurer, were slain by his followers. Alarm ed at this desperate attack, the council agreed that the king should hold a conference with this resolute insurgent in Smithfield. The young monarch, attended by the Lord-Mayor of London, and the principal members of his government, together with a small party of the tower garrison, was the first to arrive at the appointed spot ; and a knight was sent to summon Wat, the tiler, to the royal presence. The rebel leader who was just then entering Smithfield would not receive the message, unless the messenger paid him the compliment to dismount from his horse, and was about to strike him with his dagger for his neglect of this ceremony, when the king himself commanded the knight to dismount. In his conference with young Richard, it is said, by Wal singham, that he demanded, not only the enfranchisement of all bondsmen, but the abrogation of all the forest laws. The king was unprepared with a reply to such unexpected requisitions, and while he hesitated to answer and turned about to consult the lords of his council, Wat, the tiler, caught hold of the reins of the sovereign's horse and brandished his sword. Sir William Wal worth, the Lord-Mayor, perceiving the danger ofthe king, instantly struck the rebel a blow with his sword on the back of the head, and smote him to the ground, where he was despatched by John Standish, an esquire of the king's, and other attendants. The death of their leader discon certed, as it usually does on such occasions, the spirit of the rude and undisciplined mob, already, it is probable, discontented with a position to which they were unaccustomed, and acted upon by jealousies and anxieties. It is said that some of them vociferated threats for the loss of their chief tain ; and Richard, then a youth scarcely more than fifteen years of age, has been complimented with an act of heroism very dissimilar to the character and conduct displayed by him in the sub sequent incidents of his life. Historians relate, upon very vague authority, that offering to supply the place of their leader himself, he rode before them to St. George's fields, where they were met by Sir Robert Knolles, at the head of a body of well armed veteran soldiers, who had been secretly drawn together,*}: at sight of whom they instantly dispersed. They had no sooner returned to their homes than the charter of enfranchisement was revoked by the parliament, and many of the unhappy insurgents were executed without even the forms of legal proceedings. If, therefore, the heroism of this young monarch was great, the treachery of his counsellors was still greater. This familiar piece of history is so closely connected with the life of John of Gaunt that we could not well omit it, and our readers will excuse us if we have looked at the circumstances of it more cautiously than some of our predecessors. The Duke of Lancaster was in Scotland when the insurgents were destroying his palace, and he no sooner had intelligence of their numbers and * Sir Oswald Mosley's History of Tutbury. j Rapin. % Hume: who quotes Froissart, Walsingham and Knyghton, and adds, that the king promised them the same charter he had previously granted to the Essex men."], [595, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 557 of the city of London being tumultuously occupied by them, than he concluded without delay, a truce for three years, with the Scots, although he continued in that country until the sedition was appeased. The king of Scotland is said, by Rapin, to have offered him an army of twenty thou sand men to suppress the rebellion, and a report was so extensively spread that he was about to take advantage of the troubles and enter England at the head of a Scottish army, that the gov ernor of Berwick-upon-Tweed, received orders from the Earl of Northumberland, to close the gates of that town against him. An indignity which the high spirit of the royal Duke long re sented. On the destruction of the palace of the Savoy, the keeper of his wardrobe hastened to Leicester, in order to secure the valuable furniture contained in the castle from the disaffected populace by removing it into the abbey. The abbot, apprehensive of the violence of the mob, refused to re ceive it, and it was, with difficulty, deposited in St. Mary's church. The queen of Castile, Lancaster's amiable consort, then resident at Tutbury, was alarmed by the threatening tumults, and sought refuge in the castle of Pontefract, but she was there refused admittance, although those in possession of that fortress were the retainers of her husband. On the return of the Duke of Lancaster to London, an open feud broke out between the Earl of Northumberland and himself, which was with difficulty accommodated by the interference of the king. In 1383, the Duke of Lancaster marched to the north with an army of two thousand lancers, and six thousand archers, with which he invaded Scotland and took possession of Edin- burgh. This success was followed by no permanent advantage. The king of Scotland implored to be, and, at the intercession of the Duke of Burgundy was, admitted as a party in the truce agreed upon between France and England. But the absence of Lancaster had afforded his ene- mies an opportunity to devise a plan for his destruction. An Irish monk, ofthe order of Carme- lites, went to Salisbury, where Richard was holding the parliament, and charged the Duke with designing to murder the king and seize upon the crown. This accusation was apparently support- ed by circumstantial details that entitled it to attention, and Richard consulted two of his domestic chaplains upon it previously to its being submitted to the council. While this consultation was going on Lancaster suddenly entered the royal presence on his return from his northern expedi- tion, and being made acquainted with the charge that had been preferred against him, he asserted his innocence in the strongest terms, and demanded that a day should be appointed for him to an- swer his accuser before the council. His request was complied with, and the monk was delivered into the custody of Lord Holland, the son of the king's mother by her first husband. It was un- doubtedly a circumstance liable to suspicion that, on the morning of the day on which this im- portant investigation was to have taken place, the monk was found hanging to the ceiling of the room in which he was confined, and that there were marks of barbarity upon the body, which seemed to prove that he could not have been his own executioner. The incident increased the hatred which the people manifested towards the Duke, although it is not improbable, as Rapin intimates, but that the murder was perpetrated by the inventors of the accusation, who, dismayed by the unexpected return of Lancaster, may have dreaded lest the unhappy friar might divulge the whole scheme, and implicate them in the transaction. But in the same year another circum- stance seemed to strengthen the belief of the people in the monk's accusation. An alderman of London, who was high in the confidence ofthe Duke of Lancaster, was charged with treasonable offences, and on his trial he was found guilty. The Duke was then absent on an embassy at P iris, but his retainers and friends exerted themselves greatly to prevent the condemnation ofthe crim- inal, and after the trial to procure his pardon from the king. There was certainly nothing in this matter that implied guilt on the part ofthe Duke, but there existed a desire among the favourites of the court as well as among the multitude to impute to him treasonable views, which his man- ners rather than his conduct seemed to warrant. The favourites, with whom Richard's profuse and dissolute court abounded, endeavoured to render the wealth and influence of Lancaster, sources of terror to his royal nephew, and in this design they were occasionally successful. In the year 1385, Richard was so wrought upon by his confidential advisers, that he gave orders to Judge Trisilian, a man ever ready to abuse the high functions of his office at the will of the court, to"], [596, "558 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER draw up articles of high treason, and to arrange evidence against his uncle Lancaster. The Duke was at that time at his castle of Tutbury, when he received despatches from his friends in London, informing him ofthe machinations that were contriving against him. In those times, to have de manded an opportunity to vindicate his innocence by legal process, would probably have been to throw himself into the hands of his enemies, and therefore he considered it prudent to withdraw to his castle at Pontefract, where he assembled his military retainers, and prepared to defend him self. Unpopular as he was, he was speedily at the head of a considerable army, and was proffered support from many ofthe barons who were disgusted with the favouritism ofthe court. Had the government attempted to enforce the accusation by arms, a civil war must have been the conse quence, but cue princess dowager of Wales, mother of Richard, interposed her mediation, and after making several journeys to both parties, and undergoing much severe personal fatigue, she had the gratiriea_icn of effecting a complete reconciliation, and the king, convinced that the accu sations were utterly groundless, was not only reconciled to his uncle, but invited him to take a command in the army which he was about to lead in person against the Scots. As the truce with France and Scotland was about to expire, the French king not only marched a large army to the confines of Guienne with the intention of completing the conquest of that im portant province, but despatched a force of a thousand men, under the command of John de Vienne, to Scotland, in order to enable the Scottish monarch to make an incursion into the north ern counties of England, while the French fleet, with a large body of veteran troops should make a descent upon the southern coasts of the island. So great was the activity of the English gov ernment, that Richard was speedily at the head of three hundred thousand men, and, of these, sixty thousand was placed under the command of the Duke of Lancaster. The Scots and their French allies were already ravaging Northumberland, but at the approach of Lancaster they re treated to the centre of Scotland, leaving the borders unprotected. Lancaster avenged the deso lation they had committed by an inroad, in which he carried fire and sword to the very gates of Edinburgh, and as the French monarch perceived that the English were better prepared to re sist his meditated invasion than he had imagined, he sent orders to his fleet to return to the ports of France and disembark the troops. Richard, immediately, selecting the best troops of his im mense army, and disbanding the rest, joined his uncle, and the long wished-for conquest of Scot land seemed in a fair way to be about to be effected, when the favourites of the young king again filled his mind with jealousies concerning the views of Lancaster. The king indeed marched into Edinburgh and set fire to that city, but instead of seconding the plans of his uncle, he passed five days of triumphant and dissolute pleasure in the vicinity of the Scottish capital, and then with drew to Northumberland, giving the western division ofthe enemies' forces, whom Lancaster had hoped to compel to a disadvantageous engagement between the two armies, an opportunity to re treat into Cumberland, which they ravaged in a most vindictive manner. The Duke of Lancaster earnestly exhorted his royal nephew to fall upon these marauders, and at least to cut off their re treat while he himself retained possession of the principal districts of Scotland, but Richard lis tened to the persuasions of his chief favourite, the Earl of Oxford, who insinuated that the Duke sought to engage him in all the difficulties and dangers of the war, while he enjoyed the honour of retaining the more peaceable possession of the enemy's country. The young king and his court, therefore, continued their desultory progress towards London ; and Lancaster, unable, thus deserted, to maintain his position, marched to the aid of the people of Cumberland and then re turned home. On the termination of this expedition, a prospect presented itself to the Duke of realizing his claims upon the crown of Castile. Ferdinand, king of Portugal, had died without any legitimate offspring, except Beatrice, who was married to Henry, the reigning king of Castile and Leon, and who consequently claimed the throne of Portugal in right of his wife. John, a natural son of the deceased sovereign, had, with the full consent of the Portuguese nation, been acknowledged as king, and had successfully resisted an invasion of the French and Castilians, who had advanced to the walls of Lisbon and were preparing to lay siege to that city. This victory is said to have been, in a great measure, owing to the intrepidity of a small English troop which the Duke of"], [597, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 559 Lancaster had sent to aid the king of Portugal, under the command of two of his retainers, named Norbury and Harthill. The Portuguese monarch, highly pleased with this display of English valour, despatched an embassy to England, offering terms of alliance, acknowledging the Duke of Lancaster as king of Castile, and promising to assist in establishing the Duke and his consort on the throne of that kingdom. These proposals were not displeasing to Richard and his favour- ites, who were desirous of the removal of Lancaster from England at any price, and the merchants of London, who had recently extended their commerce to Lisbon, anticipated numerous advan- tages from this alliance. The Duke of Lancaster urged the compliance of the council, and in this he met with less opposition than he was accustomed to encounter. A parliament was called, and the commons with little reluctance voted a considerable supply for the fitting out the expedition. The Duke of Lancaster, thus secure ofthe assistance ofthe English parliament, made, as king of Castile, a league, offensive and defensive, with the king of Portugal, and prepared for his em- barkation with all possible expedition. In the May of 1386, his armament awaited him at Ports- mouth,* and he set sail with an army of twenty thousand men, among whom were two thousand men at arms, and eight thousand archers. The Duke was accompanied by Constance, his con- sort, and by his two daughters, Philippa and Catherine, the former of whom was by his first wife, Blanch, and the other by his present wife. Richard and his queen accompanied them to Ports- mouth, and in wishing them good success, the king presented a golden crown to his uncle, and the queen presented a similar crown to the Duke's consort. In the course of their voyage they entered the harbour of Brest, where Sir John de la Roche was besieged by the French. By the unexpected aid of Lancaster's forces the siege was raised, and the Duke, re-embarking, continued his voyage. On the 9th of August he landed at Corunna, and having made himself master of several towns in Gallicia, he passed the winter at Compostella. During this interval he concluded a marriage between his eldest daughter, Philippa, and the king of Portugal, and having consult- ed with his ally on the best means of prosecuting the war, he entered Castile in the March follow- ing, crossed the Douro, and was soon master of the unfortified towns and the open country. In the walled cities and fortresses, the king of Castile had ordered the cattle and grain to be stored, and he carefully avoided a general engagement. The English troops, unable to bear the heat of the climate, and in want of provisions, were seized with a distemper which rapidly thinned their ranks, and as a French army was daily expected to aid the Castilian monarch, the Duke of Lan- caster was compelled to listen to terms of accommodation. It was agreed that the eldest son of the king of Castile should espouse the only daughter of Lancaster and his consort Constance ; and that the claims of the Duke and his wife to the crown of Castile should be relinquished, upon the payment of two hundred thousand nobles and an annuity of ten thousand marks. In the month of November, 1390, the Duke of Lancaster returned to England, at a time when the favourites who surrounded the king had inflamed his mind with suspicions against the Duke of Gloucester, another of his uncles. During the absence of Lancaster, the Earl of Oxford, the principal favourite of the king, had risen in dignity and power. He was made Duke of Ireland, and with the government and reve nues of that island conferred upon him for life, he controlled the whole counsels of the realm. The barons indignantly bore the sway of an abandoned court under the direction of a man who had no qualities to recommend him but his personal beauty. The Earl of Derby, eldest son of the Duke of Lancaster, joined with his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and other noblemen, to restrain the power of the court. The king and the favourite took the alarm, and the latter raised an army in Wales, where he had considerable influence, and marched hastily towards London. The Earl of Derby encountered him in Oxfordshire, and obtained an easy victory over him. At the very commencement ofthe battle, the favourite, fearful of falling into the hands of his enemies, fled from the field, and the army, dispersed in every direction, left the baggage in the hands of the victors. This defeat broke all the measures of the court, and the government was for a time con ducted with more discretion; but shortly before the return ofthe Duke of Lancaster from Spain, \u2022 Rapin. Froissart. Sir Oswald Mosley says Bristol, History of Tutbury."], [598, "560 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER another change had taken place in the councils of the king, and the Duke of Gloucester was not only dismissed, but was subjected to accusations of treasonable designs, brought against him by Richard's pernicious favourites. The return of Lancaster, at such a period, was not very pleasing to the courtiers ofthe young king, and the reconciliation which the Duke made it his first business to effect between Richard and Gloucester, added to the alarm at his influence. To remove him from the court, they per suaded the king to offer him the province of Guienne, with the same rights of sovereignty which Edward III. had granted formerly to the Black Prince. Lancaster accepted this princely do main, with the title of Duke of Aquitaine, but he seems to have been in no haste to take posses sion of it. Whether he saw the conspiracy that was forming among the abandoned counsellors of the king against the Duke of Gloucester, whom of all his brothers he seems to have particularly esteemed, or whether his Spanish expedition had left him without the means of entering upon a government which, being overrun by the French and otherwise greatly unsettled, would, at the beginning, require a large expenditure of money and troops, it is certain that he devoted himself for a long time to the pleasures of the young monarch, and to such measures as he hoped would allay the asperity of his favourites. His eldest son, Henry, Earl of Derby, had deeply incurred the hatred of the court, not only by his military character and by the popularity of his manners, busby the part he had taken in heading the troops of the combined barons and compelling the Duke of Ireland, for whom Richard entertained an inordinate affection, to seek his safety in Hol land, where he soon afterwards died. To shield the Earl of Derby from the resentment to which he was exposed, and to send him far beyond the reach of his malevolent enemies, his father equip ped him to join a sort of crusade which was then carrying on against the pagans of Prussia and Lithuania. He went attended by a thousand knights with their esquires and military retainers, and obtained great reputation both for his prudence and his courage. Soon after the departure ofthe young Earl of Derby, his father held a great hunting party at Leicester, where he entertained the king, queen and a great number of barons with their ladies. In the year 1393, we find him employed, together with his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, in negociating a peace with France ; but these two princes could not, without making unwarrantable concessions, obtain more than a truce for four years. During the absence of the two royal Dukes, at the beginning of the ensuing year, their wives, Constance and Isabella, daughters of Peter the Cruel, king of Castile, died shortly after each other, and on the 7th of June, in the same year, the queen consort of Richard also expired. , 4 On the return of the Duke of Lancaster to England, he prepared to take possession of the dukedom of Aquitaine, which had hitherto been to him a title without a revenue. On landing at Bourdeaux, he was met by a deputation of the Gascon barons, who represented to him, that the sovereignty of that province was indissolubly united to the crown of England, and they averred that it was not even in the power of the king of England to alienate it. They also argued, with more show of reason, that such alienation would be impolitic, as it might, at no distant period, de prive them of that protection from England which had to that period prevented their becoming the vassals of France. With respect to the precedent of their having submitted to the king's fa ther, Edward, the Black Prince, they maintained that they yielded to his personal sovereignty only because he was next heir to the crown, and knowing that on that account, the alienation could not be lasting. The fact seems to have been, that the Duke of Lancaster was as unpopular in Guienne as in England, and that his former expeditions in that country, whatever impression they had left of his valour, were not favourably recollected with regard to his good conduct or good fortune. The king was therefore obliged to resume his grant, and the court recalled the royal Duke in no very courteous manner. The king received him with coldness on his return, and he hastily retired from court to Lincoln. His mistress, Catherine Swynford, the mother of four of his children, and the object probably of his earliest affection, was in that city. He, now in the decline of life, sought consolation in her society, and in less than a week she became his wife. This marriage gave great umbrage to the king and his court, but Catherine, by her pru dence and captivating manners, soon vindicated her claims to her elevated rank, and she not only"], [599, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 561 won for herself and the Duke the respect ofthe court, but acquired for him a degree of popularity to which he had, all his life, been a stranger. So extensive was her influence, that, in 1397, an act was passed to render her children legitimate. John Beaufort, the eldest, was created Earl of Somerset ; Thomas Beaufort, the youngest, Earl of Dorset ; and her second son, Henry, was sub sequently the aspiring and turbulent bishop of Winchester, and at the same time a cardinal and chancellor of England; the awful death of this ambitious prince has been thus eternized by Shakspeare : \" Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on Heaven's bliss, Hold up thy hand \u2014 make signal of thy hope He dies and makes no sign. \u2014 O God, forgive him !\" The tranquility with which the Duke of Lancaster seemed desirous of passing the last years of his existence was unattainable in a period so subject to agitation and violence. He and the Duke of York had hoped, that the conciliation they had effected between the king and their brother, the Duke of Gloucester, would be durable, but Gloucester was not of a temper to give way to the cabals of the court favourites, and, at length, wearied by the inefficacy of their continual remon strances they withdrew from public affairs. The ruin and death of the Duke of Gloucester was then determined, and his subsequent murder (the particulars of which do not belong to our nar rative) is an atrocious stain upon the weak and misguided sovereign. After the commission of this crime, Richard and his council no longer sought for the least disguise, but openly took mea sures to strengthen their absolute power. A parliament was summoned, ancl by the corruption ofthe sheriffs and other returning officers, it consisted of members entirely devoted to the views ofthe court. To intimidate the barons, who, on hearing of the murder ofthe Duke of Glouces ter, had armed their vassals and prepared to resist all encroachments on their rights with arms, impeachments were preferred against the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The two last were banished, and Arundel was executed. In order to conciliate the Duke of Lancaster, who had not disguised his dislike of these proceedings, the king conferred on his eldest son, the Earl of Derby, who had recently returned with great reputation from his Li thuanian expedition, the title of Duke of Hereford, ancl on John Beaufort, the eldest of Lancas ter's children by his third wife, that of Marquess of Somerset. On the 30th of January, in the ensuing year, an occurrence took place, in which the eldest son of Lancaster was principally concerned, and which, in its results, led to the dethronement and death of this unhappy sovereign. A charge of high treason against Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, was preferred by the Duke of Hereford. Mowbray denied the charge, and it was agreed in pre sence of Richard, that the affair should be decided by the laws of chivalry, in the lists, by single combat. Coventry was fixed upon as the place of rencontre. Hereford first entered, armed at all points, on a white steed, caparisoned in green and blue velvet, embroidered with golden swans and antelopes. His titles being proclaimed, in the usual manner, he dismounted, and, with his spear in his hand, he sat down in a chair of green velvet at one end of the lists. \u2014 The king soon after arrived, accompanied by a body of the nobility and a very considerable military force. When the king was seated, the Duke of Norfolk appeared on a horse richly caparisoned with crimson velvet, embroidered with silver lions and mulberry trees : having been announced and sworn that his quarrel was just, he also dismounted, and seated himself in a chair of crimson velvet, hung with white and red damask. At a signal given, the noble Dukes vaulted into their saddles and prepared for the onset, when the heralds who attended the king, suddenly, to the surprise of all present, proclaimed the royal command that they should desist from the expected combat. The Dukes dismounted and re-seated themselves. Two hours of suspense elapsed. A herald then proclaimed silence, and Sir John Busby, speaker ofthe House of Commons, read a record ofthe judgment ofthe king, by which the Duke of Hereford was banished for ten years, and the Duke of Norfolk for life. The latter nobleman shortly afterwards died at Venice. By this sentence Richard assumed the prerogative of punishing two noblemen of the highest rank, without any regard to the laws of the land, which assured to them a trial before their peers. He dreaded them both, and although, struck with the popularity of Hereford, who was attended by crowds of"], [600, "562 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER the common people to the place of his embarkation, he remitted four years of the term of banish ment, yet he pursued him with malevolence even in the retreat he obtained at the court of Paris. Having heard that through the favourable reception of the French king, Hereford was likely to espouse the daughter of the Duke de Berri, Richard sent over the Earl of Salisbury to break off the match, by the most injurious insinuations. But the enmity of the king and his favourites was not confined to the diffusion of slander. On the 3rd of February, 1399, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, expired at the palace of the bishop of Ely, in London. Richard, without the slightest regard to the rights of the Duke of Hereford, seized upon the goods and rents of his deceased father. By authority of his council, the claims of the new Duke of Lancaster were annulled, and his attorney, by whom those claims were preferred, was seized and condemned to banishment as a traitor. Perhaps few princes of the blood royal, ever stood higher in public estimation than Henry, Duke of Lancaster and Hereford, and Earl of Derby ; nor was he less respected by the old and powerful barons than he was by the people. The injury which the king ancl his favourites had inflicted upon him was through a breach of the laws, that rendered the tenure of every estate in the kingdom insecure, and the great landowners had a common interest in espousing his quarrel. In the mean time, the tyranny of Richard and his favourites had been carried to a height that roused the indignation of the whole country. They had obtained from the last parliament, which had been chosen in a manner to secure its servile obsequiousness to the pleasure of the court, a committee of twelve peers and six commoners, invested with full power to act as a parliament on all occasions. There was no longer any restraint to the absolute authority of the crown. Money was raised or rather extorted by every imaginable device : pardons that had been pronounced several years before, when armed combinations, incited by the injustice ofthe court, had, in reli ance on the royal promises, dissolved themselves and retired to their homes, were revoked, and no fewer than seventeen counties were condemned as guilty of treason. To save their property from entire confiscation, the landowners and wealthy burgesses were obliged to submit to such composition as the king's council thought proper to require, and when they at length had satisfied the avidity of the government, they were compelled to sign a bond in which they were made to acknowledge the legality of the last parliament, and of the parliamentary committee appointed by it. While Richard was thus incurring the hatred ofthe nation, he received intelligence of an insur rection in Ireland, in which Roger Mortimer, Earl of Marche, and presumptive heir to the crown, was slain. Richard was fond of military parade, and was not destitute of personal courage. His favourites made this event a pretext for compelling the people to furnish horses, carriages, provi sions and money for an expedition against Ireland, and a large army being raised, Richard in trusted the regency of the kingdom to his uncle, the Duke of York, and immediately sailed to Waterford, where he landed on the 31st of May, 1399- He took with him some of the peers whom he most distrusted, but he left behind him an injured and irritated people, and among the most discontented of the nobility who remained in England was the Earl of Northumberland, governor of the northern counties. That powerful peer had refused to accompany Richard to Ire land; in consequence of which he had, in a summary manner, been pronounced a traitor, sen tenced to banishment, and his estates were ordered to be seized for the use of the crown. No sooner was Richard landed in Ireland, than his English subjects began to consider by what means they might relieve themselves from his future tyranny. Conferences were held, and inti mations were sent to the banished archbishop of Canterbury, who then resided in France, stating that all England was ready to rise, but the people wanted a leader of distinction ; that the Duke of Lancaster and Hereford, not only possessed the esteem of men of all ranks, but that his own injuries formed a sufficient pretext for his appearing in arms. The archbishop communicated these letters to the royal Duke. Three vessels were purchased and fitted out, in the mouth of the Loire, and the Duke and Archbishop, together with the son of the late Earl of Arundel, Lord Cobham, Sir Thomas Erpingham and a few other persons of distinction, besides fifteen lances and about a score of other armed attendants, set sail for the invasion of England. It seems certain"], [601, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 563 that advices from the Earl of Northumberland induced the Duke to make for the north-east coast of England rather than to attempt a descent in any part of the shores of the channel. For some days he hovered upon the coast, expecting probably to receive advices from the northern Earl, and at length landed at Ravenspur, between Hull and Bridlington. He was there speedily joined by the Earl of Northumberland, with his celebrated son, Harry Percy, surnamed Hotspur. He was also welcomed by Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, with the Lords Willoughby, Ross, d'Arcy and Beaumont. In a few days he was at the head of sixty thousand men. His first step was to publish a mani festo, in which he declared that he had landed in England for no other purpose but to obtain satisfaction for the injustice he had sustained. This pretence of doing himself justice seemed so perfectly reasonable, at a period when the laws were little respected, that the Duke of York, who had been appointed regent, could find no men willing to bear arms against the invader. Richard had left, as checks upon the conduct of his uncle, the regent, some of his favourite advisers, among whom were Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire, Busby, Bagot and Grene. These persons finding that the citizens of London were ready to declare for the Duke of Lan caster, escaped to Bristol, whither the Duke directed his march with great rapidity through Evesham and Berkeley. This last mentioned place was held by the regent, who, having sent advices of this invasion to the king, was conducting such forces as he had been able to raise to Bristol, in order to meet Richard on his return from Ireland, and to escort him to the capital. A short conference with the regent served to persuade him to unite these forces with those of his nephew, Lancaster, and to march with him to Bristol with very different intentions. That city received him with open gates, while the friends of the king, who had sought refuge in it, fled into the castle, which they hoped to be able to defend, until the arrival of Richard, with the army, from Ireland. They maintained themselves there for four days, when, in conse quence of a vigorous assault, they surrendered at discretion. The rage of the populace against the Earl of Wiltshire and the other favourites of the unhappy sovereign, was extreme, and Lan caster, yielding to the popular clamour, condemned the Earl, together with Sir John Busby and Sir Henry Grene, to be executed. Sir William Bagot contrived to effect his escape to Ireland. So contrary were the winds for nearly three weeks, that Richard remained without any intelli gence respecting the landing of Lancaster and the revolt of his subjects; and, when the east winds set in, by which he daily received accounts of the increasing advantages obtained by his enemies, so constantly did those winds prevail for eighteen days, that it was impossible for him to cross the Irish channel. The Earl of Salisbury raised an army among his friends in Wales, but, as the king did not appear, and reports of his death began to spread abroad, those troops grew disheartened, and either returned to their homes or deserted to the enemy. About the 25th of July, Richard landed at Milford-haven. He brought with him an army of nearly twenty thou sand men, and was accompanied by the Dukes of Albemarle, Exeter and Surrey, and several bishops, but he landed only to learn the dispersion of Salisbury's troops, and to see his own hourly quitting his standard He soon was informed that the indignation ofthe people of England was every where strong against him ; that the royal fortresses even to the borders of Scotland were in the possession of his foes, and that the towns and cities throughout the realm had declared against hin# In a state of desperation he withdrew privately from the camp, where his forces were al ready reduced to six thousand men, and shut himself up in Conway castle, which was deemed im pregnable, but was, at that time, destitute of provisions. Percy, Earl of Worcester, master of the king's household, was no sooner aware that the king had quitted the camp, than he broke his staff of office, and with the remainder ofthe troops went over to the Duke of Lancaster. Richard could scarcely have expected to prolong his personal safety many days in Conway castle, or perhaps he indulged a hope of being able to escape from that fortress to Ireland.* The Duke of Lancaster had, in the mean time, arrived at the head of his army, at Chester, and hearing ofthe place of Richard's retreat, he sent the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Earl of Northum berland to open a conference with him. Some writers say that this prelate and peer were sent \u2022 Hume says that Richard proposed to escape either to Ireland or to France."], [602, "564 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER under the semblance of friendship to induce him to quit his strong hold, but it must be confessed that two persons so liable to Richard's mistrust from the injuries they had sustained from his power, were not likely instruments for that species of deception, and that Richard had little to choose between starvation and surrender. He demanded securit ; for his life, and pensions for himself and eight persons to be named by him. On these conditions he declared that he was ready to relinquish the crown. The Archbishop and Earl held out to him hopes that these terms would be accepted. He hesitated no longer, but requested an interview with the Duke of Lan caster, and was immediately conducted to Flint castle, where the Duke arrived the next day- Lancaster, with all the external ceremony of obeisance, bowed his knee three times as he approach ed the king, who, with a cheerful countenance, said, \" Cousin of Lancaster, you are welcome.\" The Duke submissively replied, \" My lord, the king, I am come sooner than you appointed me, because the common fame of your people is, that you have for these one-and-twenty years gov erned very ill and rigorously, with which they are not at all satisfied ; but, if it please God, I will help you to govern them better for the future.\" To which the king calmly answered, \" Fair cousin, since it pleaseth you, it pleaseth us also.\" ' These,' says the author of the Chronicle of Lambeth, who was present, ' were all the words they had together.' On the same day the king and the duke set off in company to Chester, and thence proceeded through Lichfield and Coven try to London. As they approached the metropolis, the inhabitants came out in multitudes to meet them, and while they saluted Lancaster as the preserver of the country, they execrated the unhappy Richard with loud ancl bitter curses. This incident has given Shakspeare occasion for introducing a fine passage in an historical play which is otherwise unworthy of him, and has af forded Northcote a subject for as fine a picture. Richard was committed to the Tower. Lancas ter's first step was to have a parliament called in the king's name, and to this parliament was as signed the important task of deposing one king and of nominating another in his place. The Duke of Lancaster, a cautious and politic prince, would not have thus elevated the prerogative of parliament could he have ascended the throne by any other means, but there was living an Ed mund Mortimer, lineally descended from Lionel, the second son of Edward III. who had claims to the crown in the line of succession superior to those of a son of John of Gaunt. Whether the parliament saw the importance of the precedent they were called upon to establish is doubtful : the majority, in those days when political principles were little understood, were overawed by the circumstances in which they were placed. Richard was first compelled to resign the crown into the hands of his rival, and on the next day this act of resignation, together with thirty-three arti cles of accusation or rather of impeachment, were laid before parliament, on which the two houses were called upon to pass an act of deposition. These articles, which charged Richard with the murder of his uncle Gloucester, with having put Arundel and others illegally to death, with hav ing levied money upon the people under unjustifiable pretences, and with having lavished away the public reyenue by enriching his pernicious counsellors, were little examined or canvassed, but seem to have been regarded as containing charges too notorious to require investigation. The Bishop of Carlisle had alone the courage to take upon himself the defence of his unhappy master, but his arguments rested generally upon the abuses to which uncontrolled sovereignty is always liable ; while, with more of the boldness of truth, he insisted on the invalidity of the title of the Duke. By immediately committing the honest bishop to the abbey of St. Albans, the Duke of Lancaster did more to impugn his own fitness to wear the crown than any thing contained in the oration of the right reverend prelate. Richard was deposed by the votes of both houses, ancl the throne being declared vacant, the Duke of Lancaster stepped forward, and having crossed himself and called upon the holy name of Christ, he pronounced the following words, which we shall transcribe from Hume, verbatim, on account of their singularity : \"In the name of Fadher, Son and Holy Ghost, I, Henry of Lan caster, challenge this rewme of Ynglande, and the crown, with all the members and the appurtenances : als 1 am dcscendit by right line of the Mode, coming from Ike gude King Henry the therde, and throge that right that God of his grace hath sent me, with help of kym and of myfrendes to recover il : Ike which rewme was on the poynt lo be undone by clef aut of governaunce, and undoying of the gude lanes''"], [603, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 565 In this, with a studied obscurity of expression, the Duke of Lancaster derived his title from Henry III. because there existed a popular rumour, that Edmund, surnamed Crouchback, who possessed the confiscated estates of the Ferrers, Earls of Derby, in the reign of his father, Henry III. was in reality born before his brother Edward, but had, by his parents, been displaced from the inheritance of the crown, on account of his deformity. It was immediately decreed by both houses, that Henry of Lancaster should be proclaimed king, by the title of Henry IV. ; and thus with the rest ofthe titles of that prince, that of Earl of Derby merged into the hereditary distinc tions ofthe crown.

A eon and heir. Sir Oswald Mosley, in his History of Tutbury,* says the title of Earl of Derby, as possessed by the family of Stanley, \" was not derived from the town of Derby, as that ofthe Ferrers was, but from the hundred of West Derby,\" in Lancashire. We doubt, with much deference to die judg ment of the worthy Baronet, the correctness of this statement, and we are inclined to think, un less Sir Oswald has proofs to the contrary, that the title conferred by Henry VII. on his father in-law, after the battle of Bosworth-field, was the revival of the old title which he found merged in the crown, rather than the creation of a new Earldom. The Ferrers had held, in their days, that portion of Lancashire then held by Sir Thomas Stanley, and the district called West Derby, might have been so termed by them to distinguish it from the more Eastern county in which they had such large possessions. The Earls of Derby are always found enrolled among the magistracy of Derbyshire, which can only be in consequence of their title being considered exactly the same as that of the ancient Earls. It is agreed by Camden, and other celebrated antiquarians, that the noble family of Stanley is descended from the ancient barons Audeley, of Audeley, in the county of Stafford, as shown in the pedigree. Adam de Audeley, who bore for his arms, Gules, a fret, Or, had, of the gift of Henry I. the manor of Raveney, in Cumberland. His eldest son, Lydulph, was the ancestor of the lords Audeley, who continued in a direct line down to the 25th of July, 1391, when Nicho las, the last heir male, died and was succeeded by Joan, his sister and sole heir, who married Sir John Touchet, knt. who was slain at the battle near Rochelle, on the 22nd of June, 1372, from whom descended the present George John Thickness Touchet, Baron Audley, of Heleigh castle, in the county of Stafford. Adam, the second son of Adam, above mentioned, was the progenitor of the noble family of Stanley ; for William, his son, in the reign of king John, had from his cousin, Sir Adam, son of Lydulph, the manor of Stanleigh and half of Butterley, in the county of Derby, and took the surname of Stanley from that manor, and made it his residence. His grandson, Sir William de Stanley, by his marriage with Joan de Bamville, became possessed of Great Stourton and Picton, in Cheshire, and the bailiwick of Wyrral forest He assumed the armorial bearings now used by his descendants in lieu of those worn by his ancestors. John, his eldest son, was lord of Great Stourton and Stanley, and was father of John, of Greswith, in the county of Cumberland, ancestor of the Stanleys of Dalgarth, in the said county, and of Sussex ; and Sir William, who was lord * Page 133, in a note. 4 D"], [608, "570 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER of Stanley and Stourton. His eldest son, Sir William, succeeded to the manors of Stanley, in Derbyshire, and Hooton, in Cheshire, and to the bailiwick of Wyrral forest, and was the ancestor of the present Sir Thomas Stanley Massey Stanley, of Hooton, in Cheshire. Sir John Stanley, K. G. the eldest son of Sir William, was greatly enriched by his marriage with Isabel, the daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Latham, of Latham and Knowsley, in the county of Lancaster, descended from Robert Fitz Henry, the founder of Burscough monastery. In 1385, he was lord deputy of Ireland, with a fee of one hundred marks a year. In 1389, he had a grant ofthe manor of Blake castle, in Ireland. In 1395, he was appointed constable ofthe castle of Rokesburgh, in Scotland, and, in 1399, he was Lord Justice and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In the same year he was with Richard II. at Conway castle; and also at the accession of Henry the Fourth to the throne, on the 29th of September. In 1404, he obtained a grant in fee ofthe Isle of Man, and with Roger Leke had a commission to seize on the city of York and its liberties, on the forfeiture of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. He held the Isle of Man and all the adjacent isles, as also the regalities, franchises and rights thereto belonging, of the king, his heirs and successors, by homage and the service of two falcons, payable on the days of their coronation. The Isle of Man remained in the family from the time ofthe grant (except a short interval during the civil wars when Lord Fairfax held it) and the Earls of Derby had ab solute jurisdiction over the people and the soil, until it came, by descent, to Charlotte, Duchess of Athol, who had the same jurisdiction until 1765, when the regalities, &c. ofthe said isle was purchased by the crown for __70,000. He was appointed attorney general to Thomas de Lan caster, the king's son, and was one of the witnesses on his creation to the titles of Duke of Clarence and Earl of Albemarle. In the first year of Henry V. he was installed a Knight of the Garter, and was again constituted Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for six years, in which government he died, January 6, 1414. The grandson of Sir John, Sir Thomas Stanley, knt. was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and called to parliament in that kingdom in 1432. In 1448, being comptroller of the king's house hold, he, among others, obtained a grant ofthe goods and chattels of Humphrey, Duke of Glou cester, with power to dispose of them without account. In 1449, he, with John, Viscount Beau mont, and others, was commissioned to treat with the Scots for a truce between the two king doms. In 1450, he, with others, concluded the truce, and was one of the conservators for the king of England. In 1451, he was in commission for the custody and defence of the town and castle of Calais, and the adjacent marches, including the tower of Risebank. He was subsequent ly elected a Knight ofthe Garter, appointed counsel to Edward, Prince of Wales, ambassador to Scotland, &c. and summoned to parliament on the 20th of January, 1455-6, as Lord Stanley. His lordship was succeeded at his decease, in 1458-9, by his eldest son, Thomas, summoned to parliament on the 21st of May, 146l, as Lord Stanley, and having mar ried Eleanor, daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, was importuned by that Earl to put himself in arms against the king, which he refused. He was Justice of Chester in 2 Edward IV. and con tinued in that office till 1 Henry VII. In 1475, being Steward ofthe King's Household, he was retained to serve in the French wars for one year, with forty men at arms and three hundred archers. In 1483, his lordship commanded the right wing, consisting of 4000 men ofthe Eng lish army, sent against Scotland, under Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and took Berwick by as sault. He was faithful to Edward IV. and a friend to Edward V. which, it is said, the Duke of Gloucester, protector to the young king, took so exceedingly ill, that he had a design to murder him, at the time (June 13, 1483) when he took Lord Hastings from the council-board in the Tower, and caused him to be beheaded ; for one of the Duke's soldiers struck at his lordship with an halbert, which he avoided by suddenly stooping and concealing himself under a table. Though Lord Stanley saved himself, yet he was committed to prison immediately after the Duke had ob tained possession of the crown. He was however not long in confinement, for king Richard, fearing that his son, Lord Strange, who was at that time at the head of some troops in Lincoln shire, might cause an insurrection, liberated him ; and in order to conciliate his favour, made"], [609, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 571 him Steward of his Household ; and, on the l6th of December, 1483, instituted him Constable of England for life, with a fee of \u00a3100. a year out ofthe king's revenues in the county of Lancaster. How far his lordship contributed to the victory of Bosworth field is recorded in history ; and his placing the crown of Richard upon the head ofthe victorious Richmond in the field, and' pro claiming him king, by the title of Henry VII. is also a matter of historic record. In considera tion of those eminent services the new monarch advanced Lord Stanley, on the 27th of October, 1485, to the dignity of Earl of Derby, and constituted him one of the commissioners for execu ting the office of Lord High Steward of England, upon the day of his coronation. His lordship, in the following March, had a grant of the great office of Constable of England for life. He had no children by his second marriage, and, dying in 1504, was succeeded by his grandson. Sir William Stanley, 2nd son of Lord Stanley, was of Holt castle, in Denbighshire, and of Rid ley, in Cheshire. In 1461, he had the office of Chamberlain of Cheshire. On the accession of Richard III. 22nd June, 1483, he was appointed Justice of North Wales, and being with his elder brother instrumental in procuring the crown for Henry VII. at the battle of Bosworth field, on the 22nd of August, 1485, was soon after constituted Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in stalled Knight of the Garter. But notwithstanding his eminent services to that prince, he was beheaded on the 1 6th of February, 1495, on pretence of being engaged in a conspiracy for placing Perkin Warbeck on the throne. Sir George Stanley, eldest son of Thomas Stanley, first Earl of Derby, married Joan, daughter and heiress of Lord Strange, of Knockin, and was summoned to parliament as Baron Strange. In 1475, his lordship was created Knight ofthe Bath. In 1486, he was one ofthe Lords ofthe Privy Council. In 1487, he was one of the principal commanders in the king's army at the battle of Stoke, on the ifith of June, when he shared the honours of that victory, obtained over John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, and his adherents : and soon after was elected a Knight of the Garter. In 1492, he was retained to serve the king in France, with ten men at arms, five demi-lances, twenty-four archers on horseback, and two hundred and forty-seven archers on foot. This young nobleman died before his father, leaving issue three sons, Thomas, John and James, ancestor of the present Lord Derby, and two daughters. Sir Edward Stanley, of Hornby castle, brother of Lord Strange, and fifth son of the Earl of Derby, commanded the rear of the English army at Flodden-sield, on the 9th of September, 1513, and by the power of his archers forced the Scotch to descend the hill, which, causing them to open their ranks, gave the first hopes of that day's victory, wherein James the Fourth, king of Scotland, lost his life. As a reward for his services against the Scotch on that memorable day, the king created him a peer, by the title of Lord Monteagle. In 1514, he was installed a Knight ofthe Garter. James, the sixth son of the Earl of Derby, was successively archdeacon of Chester and Rich mond, dean of St. Martin's, warden of Manchester College, and, in 1506\", bishop of Ely. He was a great benefactor to Manchester College, and to Jesus College, Cambridge. Thomas, the eldest son of George, Lord Strange, had livery of his father's lands, and succeed ed his grandfather as second Earl of Derby, in 1504. In 1513, he attended Henry VIII. in the expedition against France, at the time he won Theronenne and Tournay, and, at the battle of Spurs, on the 18th of August, obtained, a victory. In 1520, when Henry the Eighth met the emperor, Charles the Fifth, at Dover, the Earl of Derby rode between the two monarchs to Can terbury, bearing the sword, by the king's command. On the 13th of May, 1521, he was one of the peers who tried Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham. His lordship died at Colnham, in Middlesex, on the 24th of May, 1522, and was buried in the monastery of Syon, in the same county. He bore the titles of Earl of Derby, Viscount Kynton, Lord Stanley and Strange, Lord of Knockin, Mohun, Basset, Burnal and Lacy, Lord of Man and the Isles. Edward, the third Earl of Derby, being only eleven years of age on the death of his father, Cardinal Wolsey obtained a grant of several manors in Lincolnshire, on account of his minority. He was one of that magnificent prelate's retinue, and had five domestic servants allowed him. In October, 1532, his lordship waited on Henry VIII. at his interview with the Frencn king,"], [610, "572 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER Francis I. near Boulogne. In 1533, before the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn, he attended her in his own barge from Greenwich, and was elected a Knight ofthe Bath, with Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset, and other noblemen ; and on the I st of June, he was cup-bearer at her coro nation. In 1 536, on that memorable insurrection of the Northern men, called the Pilgrimage of Grace, the king directed his letters to him, to raise what forces he could, promising to repay the charges, and (as Holinshed observes) \" by the faithful diligence of the Earl of Derby, who, with the forces of Lancashire and Cheshire, was appointed to resist them, they were kept back and brought to quiet, notwithstanding there were a very great number assembled together of the Commons, out of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and ofthe North party of Lancashire. In 1542, he marched into Scotland, with Thomas Howard, third Duke of Norfolk, and an army of 20000 men, where, finding no resistance, they burnt divers towns and villages adjoining to the Tweed. In 38 Henry VIII. when the High Admiral of France, accompanied by the Bishop of Evreux, the Earl of Nantville, the Earl of Villiers, and others, came on a splendid embassy, the Earl of Derby, by the king's command, received them at Blackwall, and conducted them to his majesty at Greenwich. On the accession of Edward VI. he, with the Marquess of Dorset, were elected Knights ofthe Garter. Four years afterwards he was one of the peers, parties to the articles of peace made by Edward VI. with the French and Scotch, wherein the emperor, Charles the Fifth, was included. On the 6th of July, 1553, when Mary came to the crown, she, on the 29th of September ensuing, constituted this nobleman Lord High Steward of England. He came to town from his seat in Lancashire on the 8th of August nobly attended to his house in Westmin* ster. Upwards of fourscore of his servants were clothed in velvet, and two hundred and eighteen yeomen were in liveries. Queen Elizabeth, knowing his prudence and loyalty, chose him at her accession one of her privy council. He was elected chamberlain of Chester, and continued so for six years. It appears from several historians that he lived in the greatest splendour, without any dependance on the court. Camden, in the Life of Queen Elizabeth, gives the following charac ter of this nobleman : \"that with Edward, Earl of Derby's death, the glory of hospitality seem ed to fall asleep.\" And Holinshed and Stow, in their Chronicles, make this honourable men tion of him : \" Edward, Earl of Derby, Lord Stanley and Strange, of Knockin, lord and governor of the Isle of Man, Knight of the noble order of the Garter, and one of the queen's majesty's privy council, deceased at his house called Lathom, in Lancashire ; his life and death deserving commendation, and craving memory to be imitated, was such as follows. His fidelity unto two kings and two queens, in dangerous times and great rebellions, in which time, and always as cause served, he was Lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire ; and lately offered ten thousand men unto the queen's majesty, of his own charge, for the suppression of the last rebellion. His godly disposition to his tenants, never forcing any service at their hands, but due payment of their rent. His liberality to strangers, and such as showed themselves grateful to him ; his fa mous housekeeping, and eleven score in check-roll, never discontinuing the space of twelve years. His feeding, especially of aged persons, twice a day, threescore and odd ; besides all comers thrice a week, appointed for his dealing days ; and every Good Friday these thirty-five years, one with another, two thousand seven hundred with meat, drink, money, and money's worth. There was never gentleman, or other, that waited in his service, but had allowance from him, to have as well wages as otherwise for horse and man. His yearly portion for the expenses of his house, i.4000. His cunning in setting bones disjointed or broken, his surgery and desire to help the poor, his delivery of the George and seal to the Lord Strange, with exhortation, that he might keep it so unspotted in fidelity to his prince as he had, and his joy that he died in the queen's favour. His joyful parting this world, his taking leave of all his servants, by shaking of hands, and his remembrance to the last day.\" This noble Earl died at Latham house, on Friday, October 24, at twelve o'clock, and was buried at Ormskirk, December 4, 1574, and his funeral was the most magnificent that can be conceived. Henry, his eldest son and heir, succeeded as fourth Earl of Derby. He was elected Knight of the Garter on the 23rd of April, 1574, and took his seat in the house of peers on the 8th of February, 1576. In 1585, he was appointed her majesty's ambassador to Henry the Third,"], [611, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 573 king of France, to invest him with the Order of the Garter. In 1586, he was one of the peers who sat at Fotheringay, on the trial of Mary Queen of Scots, at which time he was one of the privy council to queen Elizabeth. He was chamberlain of Chester from 1587 until his death. In 1589, he was sent with other commissioners into Flanders to treat of a peace with the Prince of Parma, general ofthe king of Spain's forces, and in the same year he was appointed Lord High Steward of England, at the trial of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, who was arraigned on the 14th of April. He died on the 25th of September following, and was buried, according to his will, in his chapel at Ormskirk. Ferdinando, the fifth Earl, survived his father but a short time, for having been tampered with by one Hesket, an agent of the Jesuits and English fugitives to assume the title of King, in right of his grandmother, Alinore, and rejecting the proposal with indignation, though promised pow erful assistance from abroad in case of compliance, but threatened with sudden death if he either hesitated at, or revealed the proposal, he died of poison on the 1 tith of April, 1594, according to the menaced vengeance of Hesket, who, upon his lordship's information, had been apprehended and convicted of treason. By his will, bearing date 12th of April, he bequeathed his body to be buried at Ormskirk, where he was interred on the 6th of May following. William, the sixth Earl of Derby, at the death of his brother, was 32 years of age. Having a dispute with his three neices touching the title to the Isle of Man, was obliged to purchase their several claims. In 16*01, he was installed a Knight ofthe Garter. He was constituted chamber lain of Chester for life, and afterwards had a new grant of that office, in conjunction with his son James, Lord Strange, for the life ofthe longest liver ; which the latter enjoyed until 1647, when he was ejected by the usurping powers for his loyalty to his sovereign. Earl William died on the 29th of September, 1642, and was buried at Ormskirk. James, his eldest son and heir, succeeded as seventh Earl of Derby. He was highly accom plished with learning and prudence, loyalty and true valour, of which he gave signal proofs on several occasions in the civil wars ; especially in that memorable encounter in Wigan lane, on the 26th of August, 1651, where, with 600 horse, he maintained a fight of two hours against 3000 horse and foot, commanded by colonel Robert Lilburne ; and though in that action he received seven shots on his breast-plate, thirteen cuts on his beaver, five or six wounds on his arms and shoulders, and had two horses killed under him, he made his way, with some few of his men, towards Worcester, in order to join his majesty, king Charles the Second. At the fatal battle of Worcester, on the 3rd of September, 1651, he was taken prisoner, and, contrary to the law of nations, this noble Earl was condemned to die, notwithstanding his just plea \"that he had quarter for his life given him by one Captain Edge, who took him prisoner;\" but that was overruled ; so that, on the 15th of October, he was beheaded at Bolton, in Lancashire. This loyal Earl had been summoned to parliament in 1627, as Baron Strange, under the im pression that such a barony was enjoyed by his father ; but that not being the case, the summons amounted to the creation of a new peerage, which eventually devolved upon the ducal house of Athol. This Earl, who was so truly loyal to the royal family, and of a great and heroic spirit, fell a sacrifice to the illiberal revenge of Oliver Cromwell, who sent a letter, offering him his own terms, if he would deliver up the Isle of Man ; to which the Earl returned the following answer, a copy whereof was found in Sir Thomas Roe's study. \" I received your letter with indignation ; and, with scorn, I return you this answer, That I cannot but wonder, whence you should gather any hopes from me, that I should (like you) prove treacherous to my sovereign; since you cannot be insensible of my former actings in his late majesty's service, from which principle of loyalty I am no way departed. \" I scorn your proffers ; I disdain your favours ; 1 abhor your treasons ; and am so far from delivering this island to your advantage, that I will keep it to the utmost of my power to your destruction. \"Take this final answer, and forbear any further solicitations ; for if you trouble me with any more messages upon this occasion, I will burn the paper, and hang the bearer. \"This is the immutable resolution, and shall be the undoubted practice of him, who accounts it the chiefest glory to be - \u2022_:_\u25a0__ -\u201e__!_ \" His Majesty's \" Most loyal and Castle- Town, \" Obedient subj ect, 12th July, 1649.

This lady behaved with great and exemplary pru dence and honour, in all affairs of life ; and was remarkably famous for her gallant defence of Latham-house, in 1 644, when it was besieged by two thousand of the parliament forces ; and of the Isle of Man, in 1651, which was the last place in the English dominions that submitted to the usurp ing powers, and of which Lord Fairfax enjoyed the profits, whilst this heroine was detained in prison, with her young children, in extreme indigence, till the restoration of the king and royal family, in the year 1660 : she died on the 21st of March, 1663, and was buried at Ormskirk. Charles, eldest son and heir, succeeded as eighth Earl of Derby. He ventured his life to restore king Charles the Second. In 1659, on Sir George Booth's rising in Cheshire, he appeared at the head of divers gentlemen in Lancashire, but being defeated, he was taken prisoner before the end of the month, in the habit of a serving man. At the restoration of king Charles the Second, he was, in consideration of his own loyalty, and that of his family, constituted Lord Lieutenant of the county of Lancaster; and on the 30th of July, 1660, Lord Lieutenant ofthe county of Ches ter. He died on the 21st of December, 1672, and was buried at Ormskirk. William George Richard, ninth Earl of Derby, was constituted, on the 11th of May, 1676, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, but was removed from that office in the reign of king James the Second. On the 17th of October, 1688, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lan cashire, and on the 5th of March, 1694-5, was one ofthe supporters ofthe pall at the funeral of queen Mary. On the 18th of June, 1702, his lordship was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the Isle of Anglesea, and ofthe counties of Caernarvon, Flint, Merioneth and Montgomery. He died on the 5th of November, 1702, without any surviving male issue, when the honours devol ved upon his brother and heir, James, tenth Earl of Derby, who served in the convention parliament, which assembled at Westminster on the 22nd of January, 1688-9, for the town of Preston ; and from 1695 until his accession to the peerage, he sat for the county of Lancaster. His lordship served several cam paigns in Flanders under king William; and on the 18th of August, I692, his majesty, in his camp at Lambeque, promoted him to the command of the sixteenth regiment of foot. On suc ceeding to the earldom of Derby, his lordship resigned his military employments ; and, on the 10th of June, 1702, he was constituted Lord Lieutenant of North Wales, and the county of Lan caster. He was also one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber to king William. On the 10th of June, 1706, his lordship was sworn one of queen Anne's Privy Counsellors, and Chancellor of the. duchy of Lancaster. At her coronation, on the 23rd of April, 1702, he carried one ofthe three swords of state, as he did also at the coronation of George the First, on the 20th of October, 1714. On the 23rd of September, 1715, he was appointed Captain yeomen of the guard; and on the 23rd of October, 1727 (1 George II.) Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum for the county of Lancaster. In 1726, an Act was passed, empowering the lords of the treasury to treat with his lordship and his heirs, for the purchase of all their rights to the Isle of Man ; but his lordship imagining he had a power to dispose of it by will, did not comply therewith, whereby it devolved on the late Duke of Athol, as did also the barony of Strange. His lordship died at Knowsley, on Sunday, the 1st of February, 1735-6, when the barony of Strange, created in 1627, reverted to his aunt, the Marchioness of Athol ; all the other baronies fell into abeyance between the co heirs of Ferdinando, the fifth Earl. The earldom of Derby then devolved upon Sir Edward Stanley, of Bickerstaff^ in Lancashire, bart. then one of the knights of the shire for that county, son and heir of Sir Thomas Stanley, bart. son and heir of Sir Edward Stanley, bart. son and heir of Sir Thomas, son of Sir Edward Stanley, bart. son of Henry Stanley, esq. son of James Stan ley, knt. son of George, Lord Strange, who died the 5th of December, 1497, 13 Henry VII. in the life time of his father, Thomas, the first Earl of Derby of this family. Sir Edward, eleventh Earl of Derby, succeeded to the honours of the Earl of Derby, &c. in"], [613, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 575 1735-6. On the 13th of March, 1741-2, his lordship was appointed Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county of Lancaster, which county he had before represented in parliament. His lordship was succeeded by his grandson, Edward Smith Stanley, twelfth Earl of Derby, who, in 1 774, was chosen to serve in parlia ment as one of the knights of the shire for the county of Lancaster. And in February, 1806, was appointed Chancellor ofthe duchy of Lancaster, but was removed in 1807. This nobleman has for many years been Lord Lieutenant of the county of Lancaster, and has adhered to the party known by the denomination of Whigs, in state affairs. His eldest son (now Baron Stanley) represented the county of Lancaster for many years, and his speeches, opposed to the measures ofthe Tory administrations, were replete with good sense and firmness of principle. His lordship is known to be greatly attached to the study of natural history, and to possess a very superior collection of books and specimens in that department of science. His son, the present Right Hon. E. G. S. Stanley, was made Secretary for Ireland at the accession of the ministry of Earl Grey to power, and is highly esteemed for his political firmness and his parliamentary eloquence.

This family came from the North of England to Lockington about the close of the reign of Henry VII. or the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII. but when and how the Lockington estates first came into their possession, cannot now be shown for want of access to the family deeds and records, which together with those estates, as well as those of Woodborough, Derby, Rocester, and Woodseat, including the family pictures, have all passed in a very remarkable manner away from the family. The name shows the family to be descended from the ancient English. The word Bain or Bayn, is old English, meaning ready,* and the word Brigge or Brygge, is also old English, mean ing a bridge, at present used in many parts of England. Brig or Brie, is also the Saxon word for bridge. From the time the family first came to Lockington, they have always spelt the name Bain brigge, as appears by the monuments ; but in the confirmation of arms, in 1 583, it is spelt Bayn brigge. And formerly, when little attention was paid to orthography, members of the same family have spelt their name differently . as, Baynbrygge, Bainbrigg, Baynbridg, Bainbridge, Bainbrigge, Sec. And further, according to the provincial pronunciation, as, Bembrick, Bem bridge, Sfc. It would appear, by a tradition in the family, that the name was originally Bayn, and that the word brigge was added in consequence of one of the family having, with his sons and followers, successfully defended a bridge against foreign invaders . and we now find a village called Bain bridge, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, a pass in the mountains between Yorkshire and West moreland, formerly a military post of defence, a Roman station, and a place of great antiquity .t There are also further traces of the family in the North of England, viz. Bainbrigg Holm, in the North Division of Easington Ward, in the county of Durham . and Bainbridge, between Penrith and Lowther.*}: Also at Appleby, in Westmoreland.\u00a7 The Records of Territorial Possessions in Doomsday Book did not extend to this part of Eng land, owing to the hostility of the natives to the Normans; consequently the name is not found * Bayne, Bane, adj. ready, prepared ; alert, lively, active.

And in Arch\u00e6ologia Brit. vol. 17, page 138, in a list of ancient words used in the mountainous district of York shire, is the word \"Bain,\" adj. handy, easy, obvious ; as the bainest gate, means the readiest or shortest road. f \" The river Ure is increased near its source by the little river Baint, which rolls with a great noise out of Semar pool; at their confluence are a few huts, called Baint-brig, from the first bridge over the Ure.

It is therefore probable that the families of this name inhabiting this part of Eng land, may have suffered in common with their fellow inhabitants north ofthe Humber, under the scourge of the Conqueror ;* and the name not being found amongst the Norman followers, it is to be presumed that the family did not come into England at the conquest. These facts, together with that ofthe principal bearing in the arms being the battle axe, a weapon of the highest an tiquity, being the ancient celt, showing Saxon or rather Danish connexions it is to be inferred that the family were established in England prior to the Norman invasion. This family were of some respectability in the country at an early period, from the circumstance of there being several branches of the name entitled to bear arms when coat armour became fashionable amongst the English ;| and in the first official document respecting the amis of this * \" AU the cattle, corn, property, and inhabitants beyond the Humber were destroyed and burnt by his soldiery ; the fields were laid waste, the people slaughtered and driven away. The young and old, the female and unoffending peasant, indiscriminately suffered. The amount of human misery produced by this sanguinary measure, may be conceived by the fact, that the vast tract between York and Durham was left without a single habitation ; the refuge only of wild beasts and robbers. So complete was the devastation, that William of Malmsbury says, that this dis trict, above sixty miles in length, which had been full of towns and cultivated fields, remained barren and desolate to his time, which was nearly a century afterwards. More than one hundred thousand persons perished.\" Turner's History of Anglo Saxons, vol. 1. page 10. \u25a0f- See Speed, Baker and Guillim, respecting the battle-axe.

The fess, however, seems to have given way to the chevron in the family arms, without sufficient authority. The original confirmation, in 1583, by William Flower, Norroy King of Arms, expressly says, a Fece. This deviation from the original may possibly have arisen from an incorrect drawing ofthe arms having been made immediately under the writing of the confirmation in the original manuscript, which drawing shows a chevron ; it may, therefore, have been done by a person who did not know the difference between a fess and a chevron. In 1280, mention is made of John de Bainbrigg, in a wager of battle, respecting the right to the advowson of the church of Ratcliffe on Soar, in Nottinghamshire.t In 1419) John Bainbrigg was high sheriff for York. In 1514, died Cardinal Christopher Baynbrige, primate of England, archbishop of York, and cardinal of St. Praxis. A man of great talent, and a distinguished statesman. He was almoner to Henry VII. and ambassador from Henry VIII. to the emperor Maximilian, and also to the Pope. An old family manuscript states that Wolsey bribed the cardinal's cook to poison him, in order that he might succeed to the primacy ; but Alfonso Ciaconii, in his Lives of the Popes and Cardi nals, says, that he was poisoned by a priest in revenge for a blow given him by the cardinal. The truth, however, of this mysterious murder has lately been brought to light, in the Letters and State Papers illustrating English History, published by H. Ellis, F. R. S. vol. I. page 99, which show that De Giglis, an Italian, bishop of Worcester, then residing at Rome as the king's orator, bribed Rinaldo de Modena, a priest, living in Cardinal Bainbrige's establishment, and in his confidence, to murder him, which he did by poison, and received from De Giglis the sum of fifteen gold ducats as his reward. Rinaldo being put to the torture confessed the whole, but finding that pope Leo X. would not spare his life, he stabbed himself and died in prison. De Giglis at this time was in close correspondence and intimacy with Wolsey, who was then the king's almoner, and in the zenith of his power. Wolsey farmed the bishopric of Worcester, and remitted large sums of money to De Giglis. It was said at the time at Rome, that the poison was sent from England, which could only mean the money for the accomplishment of the murder.

Wolsey, immediately on Bainbrige's death, succeeded to his honours. These facts are strong pre sumptive evidence against Wolsey. An engraving of Cardinal Bainbrige is in the possession of the family. In 1511, Arthur Bainbrigge had a grant of land, in Westmoreland, from Henry VIII. to the value of \u00a34000. per annum, to maintain a body of forces for fourteen days to observe the Scots, and afterwards to be maintained at the king's charge. From 1553 to 1586 that branch ofthe family then established at Derby, were members of par liament for the borough: their name was spelt Baynbrigge. And from 1555 to 1575 William Bembrigge, who was of another branch of the same family, bearing the same arms, was bailiff of Derby.* From the time the family came to Lockington down to the last Thomas, of Woodseat, who died in 1818, the representative ofthe family here described, has always served the office of high sheriff, either for the county of Leicester, of Derby, or of Stafford. In 1562, the Baynbrigges were in possession ofthe convent of Dominican or Black friars,t in Derby, near the Friar-gate there, which thence derived its name. In 1621, Robert Bainbridge possessed the Calke estate, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley ; which estate was purchased by the Harpur family. In 1669, William Bainbrigge died seised of the Lockington estate, which he divided into two portions \u2014 the Nether hall and the Over hall. This William was thrice married: by his first wife, Barbara, the daughter of William St. Andrew, of Gotham, esq. he had no issue ; by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Gervase Pigott, of Thrumpton, esq. he had three children, and to the eldest son of this marriage he left the Nether hall, and the lordship of Lockington ; his third wife was Mary, daughter of German Ireton, of Attenborough, esq. by whom he had several children, to this branch he left the Over hall portion of the estate.^ This third wife, Mary, was the sister of Henry Ireton, the Commissary General, who married Bridgett, daughter of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector, by which connexion this William Bainbrigge became involved with that party. The senior branch by the second wife became extinct in 1 797, on the death of Elizabeth (called Mrs. Bainbrigge, of \\\\ oodborough) who was never married. She, however, left the whole ofthe Lockington estates, as well as the estate of Woodborough, in Nottinghamshire (which had come to William, of Lockington, by his marriage with an heiress) to a family of the name of Story, not inheriting the blood of the Bainbrigge family ; thereby disinheriting the heir at law, her own cousin, Thomas Bainbrigge, of Woodseat, who was actually nearer in descent by one generation to the first mentioned William, of Lockington, than she was herself; he being his great grandson, whereas she was his great great granddaughter. See the Pedigree. Following up this system of disinheritance, the last Thomas, of Woodseat (the son of the above mentioned Thomas) cut off the entail of the remaining estates at Derby, Rocester, Woodseat and Draycot, all which had come to him by inheritance from his father ; and left the whole at his death, in 1818 (he having never been married) to the natural daughter, Mary Anne, of his own natural daughter, Elizabeth \u2014 a child illegitimate in a two-fold degree \u2014 thereby disinheriting his own brothers and their children. Thus the present descendants of the Bainbrigges of Lockington and of Rocester, have been de prived of the whole of their paternal estates. * See History of Derby, published in 1790. + Ibid. * This son was William, of the Over hall, who married the daughter of Sir Nicholas Wilmot, of Osmaston. His eldest son, William, inherited the Over hall estate, and his second son, Thomas, inherited estates at Derby and Ro cester. The only son of this William was Edward Brett, who sold the Over hall estate to his cousin William, ofthe Nether hall, and thus the Lockington estates again merged into one."], [619, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 581 Pedigree of BOROUGH, of Derby, and of Chetwynd Park, county of Salop, esq.

In 1 675, according to Hutton, Henry Mellor exposed the usurpations of the Corporation, and, through his means, no fewer than forty actions were brought against that body, in consequence of their having inclosed the common lands of the borough. A short time before, the apprentices and other persons of Derby had pulled down and burnt the fences which he had put up in Little-field and Castle-field, and from this it would appear that he was in some degree a sharer in these abuses. Some of the rioters were imprisoned, tried and fined 6s. Sd. each. The family is extant, and Colonel Mellor, its present representative, is a gentleman highly respected by his townsmen.

We find a John Hope (though not in the pedigree) bailiff of Derby in 1638-9, and mayor in 1638 and 1639. It appears by the pedigree, that the first of this family who settled at Derby was John Hope, M. D. whose eldest son, William, was also a physician, and was grandfather of the present Rev. Charles Stead Hope, who has been five times mayor of the borough of Derby. John, the grandson of the first physician, was four times mayor of Derby. Robert, uncle of the present Rev.

Edmund Edwardes, the imme diate ancestor of this branch, accompanied the Earl of Richmond, afterwards Henry the Seventh, in his expe dition against Richard the Third, and was afterwards appointed page of honour to the king. Some of his de scsndants were settled in the Isle of Ely, and others in Wiltshire."], [628, "590 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER St. Helen's House, situate at the top of Bridge-gate, opposite the site of St. Helen's priory, was built by John Gisborne,* esq. from whose descendant it was purchased by the late William Strutt, esq. F. R. S. who made great improvements in the interior, and additions to the gardens and pleasure grounds. This noble looking mansion has a stone front, with a handsome pediment ornamented with vases. It is elegantly fur nished, and contains some excellent family and other portraits and pictures. The staircase railing is a fine specimen of wrought iron work.

Wherever we find so expensive a work, we may fairly conclude the proprietor was either very rich, or did not dread poverty.\""], [629, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 591 Pedigree of STRUTT, of Derby, Belper, Sfc.

Cameron, bom at Measham Edward Strutt, of Derby, esq. a Justice of the Peace for the county of Der by, and M. P. for the borough of Derby in 1833. Field, esq. The family of Strutt is to be traced to a respectable yeoman of South Normanton, whose son, Jedediah, having settled in Derby as a hosier, joined Sir Richard Arkwright in that great speculation and invention which raised both parties to wealth, and has been a source of national power. The life of Jedediah Strutt, esq. will be given in the Biography of the County. His sons, William, who died in 1831, George Benson, \u25a0 and Joseph Strutt, esqrs. have conducted the extensive manufactories at Belper, Millford and Derby in a manner highly honourable to themselves and advantageous to the country. They are gentlemen whose liberal politics have assisted in producing the great national changes of which the people were lately so justly proud, and their encouragement of literature, and the education of the labouring class of society, will ever be remem- bered to their honour. Their manufactory at Belper is remarkable for its pre-eminence in mechanical im- provements, and for the care that is paid to the morals, intellect and comforts of its many hundred opera- tives ; and has been an object of curiosity and admiration to almost all the foreign princes that have, during the last twenty years, visited England. George Benson Strutt, esq. has been many years an active Magistrate of the County. Joseph Strutt, esq. was some time Colonel ofthe Belper regiment of local militia: he is distin- guished for his liberal donations towards all public charitable institutions, and for his kind attention to, and relief of the poor. Edward Strutt, esq. the only son ofthe late William Strutt, esq. has been returned three times to parliament as one of the representatives of the borough, and has distinguished himself by his manly eloquence in favour of public liberty. In 1 832, he seconded the motion of Lord Ebrington for an Address to his Majesty to reinstate the Reforming administration of Earl Grey."], [630, "592 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER The Genealogy of the family of BASSANO, formerly seated at London and Hale-End, in the County of Essex ; since of Stone and Lichfield, County of Stafford, and now at Derby, and Birmingham in the County of Warwick, with the several alliances thereof, lineally descended from Antonio Bassano, by birth an Italian.

Born of religious parents at Brightmet, a hamlet in the parish of Bolton, Lancashire. On his return home from college, he was called to be lecturer to Dr. Wilmot, at All Hallows, in Derby. He was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Chester, and presbyter by the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry : from the latter he had li cense to preach in his diocess during his pleasure, and as long as he continued to obey all the canons, and conform to all the ceremonies of the church. The certificates of which may be seen in Calamy's Account, p. 531. Mr. Crompton gained much respect at Derby, by his cheerful and obliging temper, but particularly by continuing to perform all the duties of his office during the time of a raging pestilence, by which the town was so desolate that grass sprung up in the market-place. Yet he himself was preserved from the infection, which he attributed to the blessing of God upon a plaster applied to his stomach by an able physician. From Derby he removed to Brailssord, a sequestered living, five miles distant, where he paid the fifth of the whole profits, as appears by the receipts found amongst his papers, to Mr. Greaves his sequestered predecessor. While here Mr. Crompton gave the profits of Osmaston chapel (belonging to his rectory, and valued at \u00a340. a year) to a preaching minister, that he might attend wholly to his own cure, and God was pleased to give more than ordinary success to his endeavours. Many were brought to an acquaintance with practical reli gion and to be constant in family and secret prayer : and many of the rising generation followed the example of their parents. He preached twice every Lord's day, and in the evenings repeated the sermons in his own family, where several of his neighbours constantly attended. He kept every first Wednesday in the month as a fast, at the church, most of the time king Charles was in exile, when he was narrowly watched, though not disturbed by those who were then in authority. On the rising of Sir George Booth, in Lancashire, and Colonel White, at Nottingham, in order to the king's restoration, Mr. Crompton went with his neighbours with such arms as they could get, to assist at Derby ; but the design miscarrying, he and some of his friends were for a while sufferers. Several of them were imprisoned, and five or six soldiers were quartered in his house. But the sudden turn of affairs prevented what was intended against them. At the restoration, he was"], [633, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 595 forced to give up his living to Mr. Edward Love, though Mr. Greaves, the former incumbent, was dead be fore that time. His countenance was much desired, and a certificate was drawn up, testifying his worth and loyalty, subscribed by seven aldermen and some substantial inhabitants of Derby, as well as by the ministers of the town and of the places adjacent, but it had no effect. He then removed to Arnold, a small vicarao-e near Nottingham ; and his services were very acceptable there and in all the neighbourhood : but by the Act of Uniformity he was soon dispossessed, and he did not choose to preach in the village afterwards, except at such times as there was no preaching in the church, or he was prevented going to the parish churches of Ged ling or Basford, where he usually attended. Arnold benefice being but small, he rented the vicarage house, where he lived till the Five Mile Act removed him to Mapperley, in Derbyshire, where he attended the next parish church, unless the minister was ill or absent; in which cases he went to some other church, or per formed worship in his own family, or a neighbouring house, as he sometimes did on the week days also. He was here much respected and very useful. Some men employed in the coal mines mentioned his familiar reproofs and good advice with pleasure many years after his death, which happened on the 9th of January, 1669, having longed for the rest into which he then entered. He was buried at West Hallam, and a useful sermon, on John xiv. 1. was preached on the oc- casion, by Mr. Robert Horn, rector, who himself died about six weeks after, and desired to be laid in the same grave. A worthy clergyman remarked of Mr. Crompton, that \" he was always cheerful though on the losing side.\" His farewell sermon was printed, and is the ninth in the Country Collection, on Ephes. vi. 18. the text is only that clause, \"with all prayer:\" the sermon is a mere skeleton, very inaccurately taken, and not at all fit for publication. Mr. Samuel Crompton, one of his sons, was pastor of a dissenting congregation at Doncaster. (Non. Con. Man. 2nd edit. vol. III. page 86.) Abraham Crompton, another of his sons, settled at Derby, and was father of Samuel Crompton, an eminent banker there. His son, Samuel Crompton, esq. served the office of mayor in 1 758 and 1 767, and of sheriff in 1768, and was many years Receiver General of the County.* His eldest son was mayor of this borough in 1782 and 1788, and afterwards resided at Wood End, in the county of York, and was father of Samuel Crompton, of that place, some time member of parliament for this borough. Joshua and Gilbert, third and fourth sons of Samuel Crompton, the sheriff, removed into Yorkshire, and were eminent bankers at York. John, second son ofthe sheriff, has been five times mayor of the borough, from 1792 to 1826, and during his mayoralty, in 1810, was sheriff of the county, and for many years was Receiver General, and an active magistrate for the same. His two sons, John Bell and Gilbert Crompton, esqrs. have for several years been active magistrates of this county: the former served the office of mayor of Derby in 1828, and the latter of the borough of Chesterfield, from which corporation he has lately retired. John Crompton, esq. is an emi nent agriculturist, and resides in a large mansion, called The Lillies, which he built. John Bell Crompton, esq resides in the Irongate, Derby, where the bank has been carried on many years. This was formerly the residence of John Newton, esq. Samuel Crompton, esq. (sheriff in 1768) built the handsome house in the Friar-gate, called the Friary House. \u2022 Amongst the family records is the following document ; but whether Samuel Crompton esq. was Receiver General at that time or not, we have not positively ascertained, if he was it carries its own interpretation. # Mr. Crompton succeeded Mr. Gisborne as Receiver General of the County. \" Derby, Deer. ith. 1745. \"These are ordering you, Mr. Crompton, to bring into the market-place here, forthwith and immediately for the use of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent his army, one thousand ston of hay, with one hundred bushells of oats, and four carts of straw, and that under the pain of military execution.

II. folio 982, up to the first who settled in this county. The first of this family who settled in this county was Timothy Fox, great grandfather of the present Samuel Fox, esq. Mr. Timothy Fox was of Christ College, Cambridge, when Dr. S. Bolton was master. He was born in Birmingham in lsi28, and had his school learning there under Mr. Billingsley. After some years spent at Cambridge, he was admitted by the commissioners ofthe great seal to the rectory of Drayton [[Basset, in Staffordshire]] in the room of Mr. John Buckbury, deceased, and was ordained by Mr. Thomas Porter, at Whitcharch, in Shropshire. He was much beloved in his parish, and though he refused the en- gagement, he continued till ejected by the Bartholomew Act, in 1662. After which, for the sake of his wife and five small children, he was encouraged by his friends to settle in a neighbouring corporation, where, by his pen, and the help of his relations, he got a comfortable livelihood till the Oxford Act forced him to re- move, when he rented a farm in Derbyshire. But afterwards he was imprisoned in Derby jail upon that Act, not for any exercise of religion, but only for coming to see his son, an apprentice in that town. He was apprehended immediately before lie sat down, and committed 28th April, 1083, and continued a prisoner till the October following. He was confined a second time, when Monmouth was in the West, in Chester jail, with several other neighbouring ministers and gentlemen, without any cause being assigned. After a month's confinement he was discharged, he and his two sureties giving .\u00a3600. security for his good behaviour. From the time of his ejectment, he preached in private as he had opportunity ; and after public liberty was granted, he opened a meeting in his own house at Caldwell, in Derbyshire, where he preached twice a day gratis, and catechised. He died in a good old age, in May, 1710. Nonconformist's Memorial, 2nd Edit. vol. 3. p. 232. His son, by his second wife, was Mayor of Derby, in 1741, and was grandfather of Samuel Fox, esq. of Osmaston hall, near Derby, Justice of the Peace for the County, &c. 1 833. This gentleman used great exer tions to relieve the distress ofthe framework-knitters in the silk hose branch, in 1S20, and collected upwards of \u00a3 400. for them.

The family of Lockett were settled upon their estate at Clouterbrook for nearly three centuries. The Rev. William Lockett, the second son of Jeffery, who died in 1699, \"was a distinguished scholar and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became intimately acquainted with Mr. Pratt, afterwards Chief Jus tice of the Court of King's Bench, and Lord Chancellor ; and with Mr. Eardley Wilmot, afterwards Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. By the former of these friends he was presented to the vicarages of St. Wer burgh's and St. Michael's, in Derby; and by the latter, to the perpetual curacy of Osmaston. His son, Wil liam Merrill Lockett, was Town Clerk of Derby. The present William Jeffery Lockett, esq. is descended from the elder branch of the family, seated at Clouterbrook, in Cheshire, and has been highly eminent in his profession as a solicitor, from which he retired in 1818, in the enjoyment of an unimpeached character, and the respect and affections of an extensive acquaintance. For the liberality, condescension and valuable information received from Mr. Lockett, the Publisher is much indebted. He therefore takes this opportunity of expressing his grateful acknowledgments to that gentleman for the numerous favours he has received from him.

William Forester, of Broadfield, in the county of Herts, who married Anne, daughter of Francis Mundy, of Markeaton, was the first of his family who lived in Derby, where he came to reside after his marriage, at Abbot's Mill, which house he purchased. After his death, in 1768, his widow continued to reside there till her decease, in 1179, and was succeeded by Richard French, formerly of the royal regiment of horse guards blue, who had married her niece, Millicent Mundy. This gentleman was distinguished as a scholar, and for his taste in the fine arts, as well as for his steady attachment to the liberal Whig principles of his time. His son, the present Dr. Forester, who, soon after he came of age, took the name and arms of Forester, still resides in the same house, which is one of the very few in the town of Derby, that has so long remained in the occupation of the same family. Dr. Forester, who is a Magistrate for the County, has been many years en gaged in the practice of his profession, and was a member of the Committee with the late Mr. Strutt and others, by whom the General Infirmary was erected; of which valuable institution he is one ofthe Trustees, and to which he was first appointed physician; an office which he held for nearly twenty years. Abbot's Hill House is pleasantly situated on an eminence which commands a view over the town of Derby, and is built in the same style as Hopwell hall, in this county. Pedigree of LEAPER, of Derby.

The eldest son of Mr. Leaper, who married the heiress of Machin, assumed by Royal sign manual the surname of his grand mother, Cleer Newton ; and his second son, that of Spell. Richard Leaper, esq. the third son, resides in the Friar-gate, Derby. This gentleman served the office of chief magistrate for the borough in 1794. 1807, 1815, and 1824; his father served in 1776, and his nephew in 1829- He is the oldest magistrate of the borough, and for his impartiality in the exercise of his magisterial duties, is universally respected by his townsmen. Besides the families whose genealogies we have given, there are many of long standing, and others who have more recently taken up their abode in the town, who are of great respectability and influence; and numerous families have within the last quarter of a century, by steady perseverance in their various pro fessions and pursuits, accumulated wealth, and have erected for themselves and their posterity elegant and comfortable dwellings within the precincts of the borough. St. Mary's Gate House stands in a recess on the north-eastern side of St. Mary's-gate. It is a large and handsome brick and stone mansion ofthe Roman style of architecture, enriched with fluted Corinthian pilas ters, a pediment and vases. This house was erected by a Mr. Osborne, whose family for some time continued to reside in it. It was purchased from that family by the late Thomas Evans, esq. who for many years made it his principal residence, and it is now the property and residence of his grandson, Samuel Evans, esq. banker. This gentleman married Miss Harrison, sister to the Rev. Mr. Harrison, of Duffield, and has issue. In this street there are several respectable houses, viz. the handsome house of J. B. Simpson, esq. which formerly belonged to the late Hugh Bateman, esq. Mr. Simpson has served the office of under sheriff several times, and has by perseverance and talent obtained an extensive practice in his profession, and the respect of his colleagues and acquaintance. He married Jane, the daughter of the late John Cox, esq. and by her has several children. His grandfather, Mr. Blyth Simpson, was governor or keeper of the county prison, and died in 1 791- His eldest son, Blyth Simpson, jun. died in 1787, and his second son, James Simpson, attor ney at law, was father of J. B. Simpson, esq. above named, Frederic Simpson, surveyor, and Charles and Ed ward Simpson, cheesefactors. He died in 1 806, aged 46. On the south-east corner of St. Mary's-gate is the elegant modern pile of building, the property of Miss Richardson, consisting of shops and private houses; one ofthe latter is occupied by Mr. Godwin, an eminent surgeon, and another by Mr. John Bromley, surveyor. The Judge's lodgings adjoining the county courts, is a large and handsome pile of building, belonging to the county. Here the Duke of Devonshire takes up his abode when he honours Derby with a visit. In the Wardwick are several good houses, occupied principally by professional gentlemen ; as those of Mr. Radford, Mr. Freer, Mr. Jessopp, Mr. Henry Mozley, Mr. Dunnicliffe, and Mr. Birch, attorneys at law; Mr. Lowe, brewer, Dr. Fox, &c. Francis Fox, esq. during a long and extensive practice in the medical profession, obtained a celebrity rarely equalled. He married Miss Douglas, sister to the late Mrs. Joseph Strutt, and has issue by her Francis, Douglas, Archibald and Charles, and three daughters, viz. Harriet, the wife of Mr. Ambrose Moore, silk throwster, Julia and Charlotte. Francis Fox, jun. is a physician, philosopher and chemist, and by superior talent is rising into considerable eminence. On the retirement of Dr. Forester as Physician to the Derbyshire Infirmary, he was appointed to that situation. Douglas is an eminent surgeon, philosopher, chemist and lecturer. This gentleman, from his professional skill, scientific acquirements, and philanthropy, has obtained the esteem of all who know him. His gratuitous lectures before the Mechanics' Institution have imparted to the rising generation and to the adult, much useful knowledge. He has filled the situation of Surgeon to the County Prison some years with universal satisfaction to the magistrates of the County, and to the prisoners under his care. H e is also one of the Surgeons to the Derbyshire Infirmary, and an alderman of the borough. Archibald, the third son, is also a surgeon ; and Charles, the youngest son, is an engineer. The eminent mechanics and engineers of this name have long been an honour to the town of Derby."], [641, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 603 This house, which belongs to Mr. Francis Jessopp, attorney at law, is a large and ancient pile of building, with projecting windows, and pointed gables, is an ornament to the street in which it stands. Over the en trance door is the date of 1611, though it appears to have been erected at a later period. It was originally built by an opulent ancestor of the Gisborne family, formerly residents in this town, and has attached to it two acres of ornamental pleasure grounds, very tastefully laid out. From the Gisbornes it passed to the late Rev. Dr. Heathcote, from whom the present owner purchased it about the year 1820. The Friar-gate is more spacious, and contains a greater number of respectable residences than any other street in Derby. The first that attracts attention is the large brick mansion called The Friary, built by Mr. Samuel Crompton, on the site of the religious house that gave name to the street. On the same side the street is the handsome house of Mrs. Fallowes, with a portico ; that of Mr. Francis Sandars, cornfactor ; of Thomas Bent, esq. an eminent physician ; of the Rev. Philip Gell, Miss Richardson, Mr. Borough, attorney, &c. On the contrary side are those of Mr. Wright, an eminent surgeon ; Mr. Longdon, hosier ; Mr. Wright and Mr. Baker, silk-throwsters; Mr. Wright, ironfounder ; Miss Meynell, Rev. Joseph Pickford, Colonel Mellor, Major Gell, Mr. T. L. Greaves, attorney, Rev. Charles Robert Hope, Richard Leaper, esq. Thomas Cox, esq. &c. The house of Mr Thomas Cox is situate at the top of Friar-gate. It is a large and excellent modern built brick mansion, with a stone portico. This house was assailed by the rioters in October, 1831, when most of the windows of the extensive front were demolished. This gentleman has contributed largely towards the education of the rising generation, and is a kind benefactor to the poor. The family of Cox have been exten sive manufacturers, merchants and factors in Derby nearly half a century. On the Ashbourn road is the genteel modern residence of Mr. Smith, a gentleman who has long resided abroad, but is now enjoying the ease and comfort of a retired life. Here are also those of Mr. TunniclifFe, watch manufacturer, Mr. Fox, corn miller, Mr. Porter, brewer, Mr. Richardson, bookseller, Mr. Sowter, builder, and that of Mr. Chapman, son-in-law to the late Samuel Rowland, esq. alderman, and four times mayor ofthe borough, viz. in 1801, 1809, 1818, and 1827, and an eminent agriculturist and sportsman. He was celebrated for having a superior breed of greyhounds, whicli was much sought after, and obtained great prices. This gentleman married the daughter and sole heiress ofthe late Thomas Turner, grocer, Queen-street, Derby, where he had carried on business many years and accumulated a large fortune, which he left to his daughter and her issue, which was two daughters; the eldest of whom is living unmarried, and the youngest married Mr. Chapman, bv whom he has issue. On the old Uttoxeter road is the neat cottage of Mr. Johnson, confectioner ; and on the new Uttoxeter road or Curzon-street, is the residence of Mr. Boden, maltster, and also that of Mr. Watson, brewer. Thornhill is situate west from the town of Derby, and is approached from the Uttoxeter road. This pleasant mansion was built by Richard Leaper, esq. and is now the property and residence of Mrs. Trowell."], [642, "604 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER This lady is the proprietor of considerable estates in the township of Long Eaton and elsewhere in this county. In Bridge-street are the residences and silk factories of Mr. James Peet and Mr. Joseph Bridgett, and the residence of Mr. Charles Eaton, tanner. In Lodge lane is the cottage of the Rev. J. G. Howard, vicar of St. Michael's, Derby. On the Kedleston road is the residence of Mr. Poyser, lead merchant. This gentleman is of a respectable yeoman family at Weston-under-Wood ; he married Miss Humpstone, and has issue. Park Fields' House, approached from the Kedleston road, was designed and built by Mr. Joseph Cooper for Henry Cox, esq. the present occupier. It is erected on a pleasant site, 'and is a brick mansion with a por tico, stuccoed with Roman cement. This gentleman's family is more particularly noticed under Brailssord. The modern villa, a little beyond Park Fields' House, is the residence ofthe Rev. Edward Unwin, vicar of St. Werburgh's, Derby. This gentleman is descended from an ancient and honourable family, and is the owner of the splendid Elizabethan mansion, called Wootton Lodge, and an estate of \u00a33000. per annum in the townships of Wootton and Ramsor, in the parish of Ellaston, and county of Stafford, and.a considerable estate in Stourbridge. \u2014 Wootton formerly belonged to the celebrated family of Fleetwood ; afterwards to the Wheelers, from whom it came to the Unwins. The Rev. Edward Unwin married Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Preston, of Flasby hall, in the county of York, by whom he has issue James, Edward, Frances and Arabella. This villa was built under the direction of Richard Leaper, esq. a gentleman who has had great taste and much experience in building family mansions, having erected besides this The Pastures' House, now the property and residence of Cockshutt Heathcote, esq. and Thornhill, now the residence of Mrs. Trowell. The Leylands is approached from the Kedleston road, and also from the Duffield road. It is a large square brick mansion, with a portico, stuccoed with Roman cement, delightfully situate, being surrounded with rich landscape scenery. It is the property and residence of William Leaper Newton, esq. an alderman of the borough of Derby, and mayor of the same in 1829. For his marriage and issue, see the pedigree of the family under Mickleover. Darley Grove House is erected on one of the highest points north of Derby, on the west bank of the river Derwent. This stone mansion, with a portico, approached from the Duffield road, was erected a few years ago by the late Mr. Bridgett, silk-throwster, who, during many years of close attention and steady perseve rance in business, realized a fortune, and was enabled, in the evening of his days, to live retired in this resi dence. This gentleman married five times, and had issue by two of them. His eldest son, Mr. Joseph Brid gett, now carries on the business, and employs nearly four hundred persons. On the Duffield road are also the houses belonging to Mr. Moses Harvey, Mr. Sowter, builder, Mr. Ha worth, The Grove Cottages, the handsome house, the property and residence of Mr. Stephen Gamble, up holsterer, and a member ofthe Corporation, and The Elms, the property of Mrs. Hall. In Cherry-street are several genteel residences, occupied by Captain Dixon, Mr. George Wallis, maltster, &c. The genteel houses on the North Parade are occupied principally by respectable tradesmen and professional gentlemen, viz. Mr. Frost, silk manufacturer, Mr. Humpston, paper maker, a gentleman who encourages all public institutions and improvements in the borough, Messrs. Ratcliff and Nutt, colour manufacturers, Mr. Symonds, maltster, Mr. Smith and Mr. Buckstone, attorneys at law, Mr. William Taylor, silk manufacturer, Mr. Oakley, the eminent portrait painter, Mr. J. H. Smithers, Mr. Whitchurch, &c. In Bridge-gate are the residences ofthe Rev. John Chaloner, and Mr. Thomas Bingham. The family of Bingham is of long standing and of great respectability. They have long been members ofthe corporation, and connected with the trade of the borough. \u2014 We find in Calamy's Lives of Ejected or Silenced Ministers, the following account of Mr. John Bingham : \" He was born at Derby, educated at Repton school, under Mr. Whitehead, and was afterwards of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he stayed till he was about twenty-four years of age, and then removed to London, for the cure of a sore foot, that was hurt when he was a child. He was two years under the surgeon's hands, and at last was forced to have his leg taken off; and declared afterwards, that one dressing was more pain to him, than the parting with it. The anguish of his leg had turned him as white at twenty-six years old, as he was when eighty years of age. He lived for some time a chaplain, and about the year 1640, he was chosen middle Master ofthe, Free School at"], [643, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 605 Derby ; anft afterwards was the chief Master. He could not for a great while prevail with himself to under take a pastoral charge, but was at last prevailed with, and presented by the Earl of Devonshire to the vicarage of Marston, of about _\u00a370. per annum ; in which he continued till 1662, and then was ejected. Upon the com ing out of the Five Mile Act he removed to Bradley hall, where he continued three years, and taught several gentlemen's sons, who boarded with him. From hence he removed to Brailssord, where he lived seven years, but met with some trouble, and was excommunicated by the procurement ofthe incumbent, though he was a man of great moderation and temper, and used to attend with his family at church every Lord's-day morn ing ; though in the afternoon he preached in his own house, to the number that was not prohibited by the Act. Upon king Charles's indulgence he preached at Hollington, where his friends, Mr. Seddon, Mr. Charles, Mr. Ogden, and Mr. Samuel Hieron, had also their turns. Mr. Bingham's excommunication made a great disturbance in Brailssord parish, and therefore, to avoid giving offence, he removed to Upper Thurvaston, in Sutton parish, where he and his wife and children lie interred. \" He was a good scholar, and well acquainted with the languages. He was subscriber to the Potyglot Bible, and stirred up others to encourage so noble a work. He was one of remarkable temperance,' of a charitable disposition, and of true unaffected piety ; loving real goodness wheresoever it appeared, how much soever persons might differ from him in their sentiments. He was for occasional conformity to the Established Church. He kept himself from the errors of the times, when there were so many sects and divisions, and constantly attended on the Classis of Ministers that met at Derby to reform such abuses. \" He was always cheerful under the greatest difficulties, contented and thankful in all circumstances, and a great contemner of the world, when it interfered with his conscience. One instance of it deserves a remark, which was this: Dr. Sheldon, the archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he had an intimacy of along stand ing, wrote to persuade him to conform to the church, telling him, that he lay so near his heart, that he would help him to any preferment he desired. He in return acknowledged his favours, and intimated, that they two had not been such strangers, but that he might very well know his sentiments ; and gave it him under his hand, that he would not offer violence to his conscience, for the best preferment in the world. He was a person of great faith in the darkest times ; and bore up his spirit in confidence that all things would work together for good to the Church of God. \" About the seventieth year of his age he got a fall from his horse, and broke his arm, but was well recover ed of it again. About a year after, he was taken with a tertian, and then with a quartan ague, that held him three years, and brought him so low, that his friends thought that every fit would prove his last : and yet, when the fits were gone off, he would often say, he was fully persuaded, and very confident, he should live to see a very great change, though he knew not which way it would be effected. He lived several years after his ague left him, but remained so weak, that he could not walk any otherwise than between two. According to his expectation, he did live to see a great change; viz. King William and Queen Mary settled upon the throne of England, which much rejoiced him. He had no distemper upon him but old age, which prevailing, he grew weaker and weaker, and expired as a lamp goes out for want of oil. He resigned his soul to God on the Lord's-day, about four o'clock in the evening, February 3, l68g, about the 82nd year of his age. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr. Crompton, from Psalm xii. 1.\" ,-,,.,. The o-reat o-randfather of the present John and Thomas Bingham, esqrs. was a mercer, and resided in the Market-place: while the Scotch army remainedin Derby, in 1745, Lord Nairn lodged at his house. His sons Joseph and John, both served the office of mayor ofthe borough, viz. Joseph Bingham, esq. in 1750 and 1760 and John Bingham, esq. in 1757- The latter gentleman purchased and resided at Exeter House and died 10th of April 1773. His sons, Thomas and John, were both aldermen of the borough. Thomas Bing ham, esq. married Frances, daughter of , and was father ofthe Rev. Thomas Bingham, rector of Norbury. He died 21st of November, 1764; and his widow, 22nd of May, 1833, aged 93. John Bingham, esq. was a hosier, in the Irongate.

This family have resided in Derby more than a cen tury, and have acquired wealth by manufacturing those elegant productions of the county, the spars, marbles, and gypsum, into monuments, chimney-pieces, vases, and innumerable variety of ornaments, which have, by superior workmanship, been brought into such celebrity. In 1 735, Mr. Richard Browne announced to the public that he \" performed monuments, gravestones, and chimney-pieces, on reasonable terms.\" His wife, Mary, died a widow, January, 1785. His son, Richard, who died August, 1816, aged 80, continued and en larged the manufactory ; but the great improvements in the machinery for cutting and polishing the marbles, &c. were made by the present Mr. Richard Browne, grandson of the first named Richard, who carried on the works at Derby and Ashford with great respectability many years. This gentleman is now retired from business, enjoying the respect of all who know him. He married first to Miss Mary Cooper, of Buxton, who died without issue, September, 1802 ; secondly, to Miss Sarah Eley, by whom he has issue one daughter. Mr. Hall succeeded Mr. Browne in the marble works, and he is a person well qualified, from his knowledge of mineralogy and long experience in the business, to continue improving in taste and elegance the innumer able articles he manufactures. He has erected a swimming and other baths for the accommodation of the inhabitants. Mr. Henry Browne, one of the aldermen for the borough, was a celebrated chemist, and obtained several patents for his valuable inventions, of which we shall speak in another part of this Work. He served the office of mayor for the borough in 1799 and 1808, and died in 1831, much respected. Exeter House.\u2014 -The author has thought it right to give a sketch of Exeter House, the mansion house which communicates with the Full-street, from its connexion with the history of this county, in the year 1 745. At that time it belonged to the Earl of Exeter, and Prince Charles Edward, commonly designated \" the Young Pretender,\" took up his abode there, and held his council of war in a fine old oak-wainscotted room (now used as a drawing-room) before he determined to abandon his project. This house was subsequently occu pied by an ancestor ofthe late celebrated William Strutt, esq. and by other families, and is now the residence of William Eaton Mousley, esq. to whom it belongs. In the Full-street many of the houses are very pleasant, and though they stand in the centre of the town are very retired. In general, the gardens behind them reach down to the river Derwent. An ancient brick house, with pointed gables, was long the residence ofthe late Rev. Henry Peach. Mr. Curzon resides in one adjoining Exeter House, which was formerly the residence of the celebrated Dr. Darwin. The large brick house adjoining to St. Michael's church-yard, was purchased by Mr. Barber, attorney at law, from Mr. Balguy, the town clerk : the gardens behind it reach down to the Derwent. This gentleman is eminent in his profession, and for his pleasing manners, application to business, and gentlemanly conduct on all"], [645, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 607 occasions, is much respected by his colleagues, and by all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance. The obligations the Publisher is under for the many favours received from Mr. Barber, deserve his public acknow ledgment and grateful thanks. The family will be more particularly noticed under Stainsby, in Horsley parish. ' Among the most ancient families now resident in the borough we may enumerate that of Brookhouse, whose ancestors more than three centuries ago filled the highest offices in the borough. In 1524 and 1532 John Brookhouse served the office of one of the bailiffs. In 1560 and 1570 Thomas Brookhouse ; and in 1592 and 1634 Mr. Robert Brookhouse served the same office. In 1662 and 1677 Mr. John Brookhouse served the office of mayor. This family, with their connexions, can at the present time produce more burgesses at a contested election than any other in the town. Several of the family are eminent plasterers, and Mr. John Brookhouse was one of the first manufacturers of Roman cement in Derby. The family of Wright is of considerable antiquity in the borough, and of great respectability. There are three families of this name residing in Friar-gate, viz. Mr. John Wright, an eminent surgeon, Mr. Wright, silk-throwster, and Mr. Wright, ironfounder (the two latter are sons ofthe late Mr. Thomas Wright, hosier, Irongate) and in the market-place, Mr. Wright, cheesefactor. Of the celebrated painter of this name, we sl>all give some account in the biography of the eminent men connected with, and natives of the county. The family of Lowe have been residents of, and connected with the corporation and trade of the borough for three generations. The grandfather of Charles M. Lowe, esq. was a maltster, and resided in the Queen- street. His father carried on the same business on a more extensive scale, with the addition of a brewery. This gentleman was many years an alderman of the borough, and served the office of chief magistrate in 1791, 1802, 1812 and 1822, and died at a good old age, universally respected. His eldest son, the Rev. Henry Lowe, was presented to the living of Hawnby, in the county of York, by the Earl of Burlington. He served the office of mayor in 1821. His second son, Charles Matthew Lowe, esq. carries on the brewery and malting businesses. He is an alderman of the borough, and served the office of chief magistrate in 1831 ; in which year much political feeling existed, and riotous assemblies and disgraceful disturbances took place. His third and youngest son, Mr. George Lowe, is a celebrated mechanic, philosopher and chemist, and has made many important improvements in the production of gas and the construction of gasometers. He has had the chief management of the London Gas Company several years, and now resides in Brighton, where he superintends the gas works. The family of Whitehurst is distinguished as being eminent mechanics in the borough of Derby for three-fourths of a century. The celebrated John Whitehurst, author of the Theory of the Earth, came from Congleton, in Cheshire, and settled in business in Derby, as a clock and watch-maker, and took up his freedom of the borough by presenting the corporation with the Town-hall clock. This gentleman removed to London on being appointed, under government, inspector of weights, &c. and his nephew, the present Mr. Whitehurst, continues the business of clock and watch-maker in Derby, which is now carried on under the firm of Whitehurst and Son. Messrs. Whitehurst are eminent in their business, and their turret clocks are ordered from various parts of the kingdom. Mr. Whitehurst's second son is rising into eminence as a bar rister on the midland circuit. We shall give a more particular account ofthe celebrated Author in the Biog raphy ofthe County. He died on the 18th of February, 1788. The late Mr. Severne carried on an extensive business in jewellery many years, and accumulated a consid- erable fortune. This gentleman was a member of the Corporation ; and a few years before his death built himself a house on the Osmaston road, which is now occupied by his widow. Mill Hill House is erected on one of the highest points south of Derby. This delightfully situated mansion was built by Mr. Ward. It was afterwards the residence of Mr. Swinburne, some time a banker in Derby, whose widow is the present proprietor. It is in the occupation of Mrs. Crompton, widow ofthe late Samuel Crompton, esq. and mother ofthe present Samuel Crompton, esq. of Wood End, Yorkshire, late member of parliament for the borough of Derby. Below Mill Hill House are the extensive lead works of Messrs. Walker. This family has for upwards of half a century carried on an extensive manufactory of white lead, and are owners of the valuable works, which are approached from the Normanton road. On the Normanton road is the silk mill of Mr. Ambrose Moore. This gentleman is an estensive silk-"], [646, "608 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER throwster, and manufacturer of piece goods, in which species of manufacture, he employs several hundred persons. This mill was formerly a government depot. On the Osmaston road, south of Derby, is the handsome stone mansion, the residence of Richard Becher Leacroft, esq. major ofthe Derby militia. This house is erected on a pleasant elevated site, above the Infir mary, and is approached from the Osmaston road. The pedigree of this family will be found in another part of this work. Osmaston terrace consists of eight genteel houses, with stone fronts, erected on a pleasant site. These are occupied by respectable families, viz. Mr. Hubbald, the Rev. Dean, Mr. Dewe, attorney at law, the Rev. Fisher, Mr. Pegge, Mr. Boden, and Miss Church. On the same road, in the township of Litchurch, is the residence of Mr. Byng. This gentleman has carried on an extensive business in the silk and cotton hosiery many years. The Messrs. Strutt declined that depart ment of their trade in his favour. Mr. Byng and his son are both members ofthe corporation of Derby. The Pear Tree House is also situate in the township of Litchurch. This residence has recently been pur chased by Mr. Briggs, who for many years has carried on an extensive business in Derby as a wholesale draper. Litchurch Lodge, another residence in the township of Litchurch, and parish of St. Peter, was built by Mr. John Brookhouse, who sold it to Walter Ruding, esq. who some time resided at it. This gentleman sold it to the late Miss Henley, and it is now the property of her devisee, Joseph Henley, esq. It is in the occupation of Mr. Foster, a gentleman who is endeavouring to establish a classical seminary for young gentlemen. On the London terrace and London road are several genteel houses, occupied by respectable families. Mr. Charles Holmes has carried on an extensive manufactory of carriages in Derby many years, and is much respected by his townsmen. Mr. Robert Hope, whose family we have already noticed, resides on the London road. This gentleman, when young, had the misfortune, whilst he was endeavouring to untie a knot of his boot-lace, to strike the fork he was using into his eye, by which unfortunate circumstance he became blind. He is a good musician, of a cheerful disposition, and universally respected. Mr. Morley, the eminent mechanic and partner in the extensive lace manufactory carried on under the firm of Messrs. Boden and Morley, resides on the London road, near to the mill erected by himself and part ner. They have introduced into the borough a manufacture which is of great advantage to the town. The houses on the London terrace are occupied by Mr. Robert Bromley, an eminent surveyor, to whom the Publisher offer, his acknowledgments for numerous marks of kindness \u2014 Mr. Mason, architect, of whom we have before made mention as superintending the building of the county prison, and guild hall \u2014 Mr. Murphy, a celebrated dentist, &c. In St. Peter's-street is a handsome house, with a stone front, now the property of Charles Holbrook, esq. This gentleman and his father have for many years carried on an extensive manufactory of white lead in Derby, where they own a valuable property. Mr. Charles Holbrook is erecting a house in the chapelry of Boulton. The house in St. Peter's-street has been for some years in the occupation of Mr. Moss, an eminent attorney, who has by perseverance and talent in his profession, gained an extensive practice. Mr. Whiston has built a house in St. Peter's-street. This gentleman has for many years been clerk to the county magistrates, and attorney to the parish in which he resides. His eldest son is of the same profession, and has recently been appointed to the office of head coroner for the county. Robert Whiston, his second son, was educated at Repton school and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself as a scholar. He is now appointed master of Chatham and Rochester Free Grammar School. Mr. Gascoyne, builder, has erected a house at the corner of Babington lane, on the site where Babington hall stood, where he owns a valuable property which he purchased from Dr. Forester. Hutton, after noticing some ofthe principal residences at the time he wrote his History of Derby, observes, \" There is one solitary mansion, however, which I cannot behold without a sigh ; it was once the most eminent in Derby, but now (179*-) ruined by time, and seems to mourn the loss of its master It is called Babington hall, and stands at the extremity of the lane of that name, both were derived from the ancient and opulent family of Babington, of Dethick, one of the first in the county, who erected the building many centuries ago, and made it their residence.

Though this venerable antique has perhaps experienced as many mutilations as years, and is multiplied into half a dozen tenements, yet the original taste and grandeur of its master are easily traced. The emblematical carvings are numerous, and in high perfection. In the last century this was the residence of Sir Simon Degge, the celebrated antiquary.\" In the Bag lane is the house and lace factory of Mr. Johnson, who, since his residence in the borough, has taken a very active part in all public business connected with it, and by his interference has in some degree checked the extravagant expenditure of which the inhabitants complained. In the Green lane are several good houses, occupied by the Rev. John Latham, Mr. Walton, druggist, Mr. Moore, artist, Mr. Boden, &c.

This family came out of Lincolnshire, and settled in Derby rather more than a century ago, where they have ever since carried on the business of booksellers and printers. It is now upwards of a century since they commenced publishing a county paper, under the title, of the Mercury. This was the only local source of information published in the county for more than three-fourths of a century, with the exception of some unsuccessful attempts to establish one in opposition. John Drewry, sen. esq. served the office of chief magistrate for the borough in 1806, 1814, and 1823. This gentleman has had three wives.

During the long and bloody contest between the Danes and the Saxons, Derby frequently changed its master. The Danes chiefly inhabited the North of England ; and the Saxons the South. They approached each other through Derby, as the medium, which often felt the horrors of robbery and butchery. The dread of their cruelties continued upon the mind for ages ; nay, it was not totally worn off even so late as my infancy ; the elder child, already frightened, informed the younger, \" that the Danes would arrive, enter every house, and murder all the people.\" Alfred the Great left several children.

She was said to have undergone so much danger and pain in child-birth, that she made a vow to re- nounce the embraces of her husband, and devote her- self to arms ; which perhaps was true ; for she was a masculine character, better adapted to reduce than augment the race. This is certain : she never contra- dicted herself bv bringing a second child ; and though her husband died about the year 908, she never took another to publish a broken vow. She was firmly at- tached to her brother Edward, who was at war with the Danes from 910 to 922. While they were in pos- session of Derby in 918, she saw anopening to revenge her brother's wrongs and her own. Having mustered a body of English forces, she privately marched into Derby, at the passage now St. Mary's bridge, attacked the enemy by surprise, and totally routed them. This battle, no doubt, was fought in the streets; and the retiring army were driven to the castle, which was quickly taken, and most of the enemy put to the sword. The Danes, though in confusion, must have fought bravely, as \u00c6thelfleda lost many of her people, and four of her principal officers, whom she much re- : garded, not as men, but as heroes.

By which exercise she so profited, that she was able not only to recite many chapters of the New Testament without booke, but also could aptly impugne, by diuers places of Scriptures, as well sinne, as such abuses in religion as then were too much in use in diuers and sundrie persons. \" As this godlie woman thus dailie increased in the knowledge of God's holy word, and no lesse in her life expressed the vertuous fruits and exercise of the same : not long after, through the fatall death of blessed K. Edward, followed the wofull ruine of reli gion in the raigne of Queen Marie, his sister. In which alteration, notwithstanding the generall back sliding of the greatest part and multitude of the whole realme into the old papisme again, yet this poor blinde woman continued in a constant conscience, pro ceeded still in her former exercise, both being zealous in that she had learned, and also refusing to commu nicate in religion with those which taught contrary doctrine to that she before had learned in king Ed ward's time, as is aboue declared. \" For the which she was called and conuented before the foresaid Bishop and Doctor Draicot, with diuers others called in to beare witnesse.

Of them that sate upon this innocent woman's bloud, the chiefest was Rase Baine, bishop of the diocesse, Doctour Drai cot, his chancellour. Sir John Port, knight, Henrie Vernon, esq. Peter Finch, officiall of Darbie, with the assistance also of diuers others, Richard Warde and William Bainbridge, the same time being bailifs of the towne of Darbie, &c. : First, after the aboue named bishop, and Doctour Draicot had caused the said Joan Waste to bee apprehended in the towne of Darbie, suspecting her to bee guiltie of certaine heresies, she was diuers times priuilie examined, as well in prison as out of prison, by Finch, the officiall aforesaid : after that brought to public examination before the bishop, at last was there burnt in Darbie, as is abouesaid. Touching whose life, bringing up and conuersation, somewhat more amply we minde to discourse, as by faithfull relation hath come to my handes : \u2014 \" First, this Joan Waste was the daughter of one William Waste, an honest poore man, and by his science a barber : who sometimes also used to make Articles ministered unto her. \" The Articles mihistred to her and wherewith she was charged, were these : \" First, That she did holde the sacrament of the altar, to be but onlie a memorie or representation of Christe's bodie, and materiall bread and wine, but not his naturall bodie unless it were received, as that it ought not to be reserved from time to time over the altar, but immediatelie to be received, &c. \" Item, That she did holde, in receiving of the sa crament of the altar, she did not receive the same body that was borne of the virgine Mary, and suffered upon the crosse for our redemption, __c. \" Item, She did holde, that Christ at 'his last supper did not blesse the bread that he had then in his handes, hut was blessed himself, and by the virtue of the wordes of consecration, the substance of the bread and wine is not conuerted and turned into the sub stance of the bodie and bloud of Christ. ropes.-\u2014 His wife had the same Joan, and one other, at one birth, and she was borne blinde. And when she was about 12 or 14 yeeres olde, she learned to knit hosen and sleeues, and other things, which m time she could doe verrie well. Furthermore, as time serued, she would helpe her father to turne ropes, and doe such other things as she was able, and in no case would be idle. Thus continued she with her father and mother during their lives : after whose departure, then kept she with one Roger Waste, her brother, who in the time of K. Edward the Sixth, of blessed memo rie, gave her seise daylie to goe to the church to hear diuine service read in the vulgar tongue. And thus by hearing homilies and sermons, she became mar vellously well affected to the religion then taught. So at length hauing by her labour gotten and saued so much money as would buy her a New Testament, she caused one to be prouided for her. And though she was of her seise unlearned, and by reason of her blind ness unable to reade, yet for the great desire she had to understand, and haue printed in her memorie the say inges of the holy Scriptures contained in the New Tes tament, she acquainted her seise chieflie with one John Hurt, then prisoner in the common hall of Darbie, for debts. \" Item, She did graunt that she was of the parish of Alhalowres, in Darbie, &c. \" Item, That all and singular the premises are true and notorious by publicke report and fame, &c. \" Whereunto she answered, that she beleeved there in so much as the holy Scriptures taught her and ac cording * \" *' \" to that she had heard preached unto her by diuers learned men : whereof some suf fered imprisonment, and other some suffered death for the same doctrine.

This done, and all things now in a readinesse, at last the poore blinde creature and seruant of God was brought and set be- fore the pulpit, where the sayd Doctour being entered into his sermon, and there inueying against diuers matters which he called heresies, declared unto the people that that woman was condemned for denying the blessed sacrament of the altar to be the verie bodie and bloud of Christ reallie and substantially, and wa3 thereby cutt off from the bodie of the Catholic church, and sayde, that she was not onlie blinde of her bodilie eyes, but also blinde in the eyes of her soule.

In this year was Roger Moore, one of the serjeants, slain most cruelly by one Henry Bennett, his mother and brother, which Henry was shortly after executed for it. 1610. This year a farryer was knocked in the head in the night, but nobody could tell how. Great affray between the electioneering parties of Sir Philip Stanhope and Sir George Griesley, and a great controversy with the townsmen. The assizes was taken away and kept at Ashbourn, for ringing the town's bell, and p'ting them by the burgesses. It was Judge Foster's pleasure so to use the town. Mr. Thomas Burdett, of Foremark, was this year high sheriff. And judges bribed, or bully'd to support That tax as due by law in open court. Derbyshire was to furnish one ship of 350 tons, 140 men,*and charges \u00a33500. Derby was ordered to pro- vide \u00a3175. and Chesterfield \u00a350. 1635. In this year king Charles was at Derby, when returning from Ripton, in Yorkshire, where he had been nego- ciating a treaty with the Scots. On this occasion the Corporation gave to the Karl of Newcastle, by whom he was attended, a fat ox, a veal, (calf) six fat sheep, and a purse of money, that he might keep hospitality in the town. They also presented the Prince Elector with twenty broad pieces. 1636. The spring was forward. The plague began, it was thought, in the Bag lane. 1637. King Charles I. granted the burgesses a new charter, . under which the body corporate was made to consist \u2014 of a mayor, nine aldermen, fourteen brethren, and fourteen capital burgesses. Henry Mellor was ap- pointed the first mayor. 1642. King Charles 1. went through Derby to Nottingham, and erected his standard there, August 12th. When king Charles set up his standard at Nottingham, about twenty Derby men marched there and entered his service. In August, king Charles marched through Derby with his army.

This year, owing to a sudden rise of the brook, three prisoners confined in the jail were drowned. Thomas Jackson's wife had three children at one birth, and all christened at the church. 1611. On March 7th, James I. granted the town a new char- ter, which confirms various privileges conferred upon the burgesses in former reigns, and invests the Cor- poration with several additional liberties, such as the bailiffs to be Justices of the Peace, -v.c.

Henry Wandell, mayor, who when he should have gone forth the Mich'as following, the fraternity of the town could not agree in the election (of a new one) and so he was constrained to serve the next year also. In his mayoralty, in November, came Sir John Gell to the town, and garrisoned it, and kept the main guard at the town hall. There happened a great drought this year that peas were all got in six weeks before barley. 1614. A great snow, and after that a great drought which con- tinued four months. 1616. This year began the suit between the town and the Duchy, &c. In this year died old Mr. Walk< and was carried to the church by his four sons, all ..eth- ren of the Company of twenty -four for the bo.ough. Also there happen'd a murder this year at Marton- lane, in the night, of one Jane Sheldon, supposed to be done by her brother. Also this year died Thomas Sutton, esq. and was buried soldjer-like. Also Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, who was High Steward of the town, deceased, and his brother was chosen stew ard in his stead. 1643. Sir Thomas Fairfax, Commander in Chief of the Parlia- mentary forces, came to Derby, and stayed here three days. 1645. The plague was in Derby, and the assizes kept in Fryer's close. Richard Cockrum was executed at the gallows on Nuns' green, for killing Mills, a servant at the Angel. The town was disgarrisoned by order of Parliament. 1647- A regiment of troopers, in the Parliament's service, marching over St. Mary's bridge, in their way to Not- tingham, observed a girl of fifteen, a few yards below the bridge, lading water into her pail while standing upon a baliny-lag (beating-log, upon which the dyer stands to beat his cloth) ; some soldierly jokes ensued, when one of them dismounted, and cast a large stone, with a design to splash her ; but not being versed in directing a stone so well as a bullet, he missed the water, and broke her head. Alarmed at this unex- pected result of his rude attack, he hastened to the front of the regiment to avoid the consequence : thus' the man, who had boldly faced an enemy in the field, fled with fear from an helpless female. Nothing dis- arms like offered injuries. She instantly, with cries and tears, left her pail, went home, where her mother was frightened to behold her covered with a stream of blood. The unknown consequences of this adventure hung upon the trooper's mind: he rode in the regi- ment eleven years after. When discharged, the world being all before him where to choose, he fixed at Der- by, followed his occupation, courted and married a young woman. In the course of their conversations, he proved to be the very man who cast the stone, and she the woman with the broken head. They lived in Bridge-gate, and in harmony, about thirty years : du- ring that period they produced ten children, the eldest of whom was my grandfather. His sword, in rny pos- session, was drawn for liberty at Marston-moor, under the Earl of Manchester ; at Naseby, under Fairfax ; and at Worcester, under Cromwell ; and was carried In this year great controversy about choosing the bai- liffs. Mr. brands Goodwyn absent, yet was chosen on Mich'mas-day, and sworne two days after, and pro- claimed again. Also at a Common Hall, some two weeks after was chosen, Edward Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, High Steward ofthe towne. 1617. In this year the election was altered, and these two (bai- liffs) maintained by the Company. There happened also a great fire at one Buxton's, in St. Peter's p'she. Also another fire at the currier's house in St. Mary's gate. The Cockpit upon Nuns' Green was made this year, paying a yearly rent unto the towne for it. Also Edward, Earl of Shrewsbury died, and the Earl of Pembroke chosen High Steward for the towne. The suit with the Duchy continued, &c. 1618. In this year the fire at Moore's house in Bag-lane hap- pened. 1621. In this year Thomas Stringer killed his man. 1623. In this year Pymme killed Jeoffard. 1624.

A dreadful hurricane in Derby that blew up trees by the roots, a pillar or pinnacle off St. Werburgh's steeple, and untiled the town's hall and many houses in the market-place, and Full-street, and on the south side of Allhallows church-yard, but no hurt above that church, not a tile, scarce a straw stir- red off any house. Edward Smith's wife drowned herself at St. James's largest family upon record, having three sons, named them after those of his predecessor, Shem, Ham, and Japheth : and to complete the farce, being a man of property, built an ark, and launched it upon the Der- went, above St. Mary's bridge ; whether a Bullock graced the stern, history is silent. Here Noah and his sons enjoyed their abode, and the world their laugh. But nothing is more common than for people to deceive each other. The world acts under a musk. If they publicly ridiculed him, he privately laughed at them : for it afterwards appeared, he had more sense than honesty ; and more craft than either ; for this disguise and retreat were to be a security to coin money. He knew justice could not easily overtake him ; and if it shouid, the deep was ready to hide his crimes and utensils. Sir Simon Degge, an active ma- gistrate, who resided at Babington hall, was informed of Noah's proceedings, whom he personally knew : the knight sent for him, and told him, '' he had taken up a new occupation, and desired to see a specimen of his work.\" Noah hesitated. The magistrate promised that no evil should ensue, provided he relinquished the trade. He then pulled out a sixpence, and told Sir Simon, \" He could make as good work as that.\" The knight smiled ; Noah withdrew, broke up his ark, and escaped the halter. ( Hutton. J 1675. A dreadful fire in the Irongate. 1676. A very dry summer and a hard long frost. 1680. The town charter surrendered and a new one obtained. 1683. A severe frost began in the early part of September, 1682, and lasted till the 5th of February, 16113, when the ice broke down the Trent bridge at Nottingham. This bridge, according to Deering, was first built one hundred years before the Conquest. 1688. The Earl of Devonshire arrived with five hundred men, invited the gentlemen of the town to dinner, declared for the Prince of Orange, and read the prince's decla- ration ; but, however well they might wish the in- terest, they refused to join. \u2022r.A detachment of the prince's troops afterwards entering, the mayor, John Cheshire, durst not billet them, per- haps through sentiment more than fear : however, a spirited constable, of the name of Cook, sent them into bridge : a young child in her arms was carried down the stream to a sand-bed, against Alderman Spate- man's door; where, recovering breath, it cried, was taken up, and saved. Derby again visited with the plague at the same time in which London fell under that severe calamity. The town was forsaken ; the farmers declined the market- place ; and grass grew upon that spot which had fur- nished the supports of life. To prevent a famine, the inhabitants erected at the top of Nuns'-green, one or two hundred yards from the buildings, now Friar- gate, what bore the name of Headless-cross, consisting of about four quadrangular steps, covered in the cen- tre with one large stone ; the whole nearly five feet high ; I knew it in perfection. Hither the market- people, having their mouths primed with tobacco as a preservative, brought their provisions, stood at a dis- tance from their property, and at a greater from the tow ns-people, with whom they were to traffic. The buyer was not suffered to touch any of the articles be- fore purchase; but when the agreement was finished, he took the goods, and deposited the money in a vessel filled with vinegar, set for that purpose. A confidence, raised by necessity, took place between buyer and seller, which never existed before nor since ; the first could not examine the value of his purchase, nor the second that of his money. Such were the precautions taken by our forefathers against one of the most dreadful\" enemies of man. A small part of this cross is yet visible, joining the prison. It was observed, that this cruel affliction never attempted the premises of a tobacconist, a tanner, or a shoemaker. (Hutton.) A woman was pressed to death in the county hall as a quarters. 1698. Great Hood, part of St. Werburgh's church fell down. 1705. This year furnishes the annalist with as dreadful an in- stance of human depravity, and the want of parental and brotherly affection, as ever has been recorded. About the reign of Oliver Cromwell, or the beginning of that of Charles II. a whole family of the name of Crosland were tried at Derby assizes, and condemned for horse stealing. As the offence was capital, the Bench, after sentence, entertained the cruel whim of e-Ue.iding mercy to one of the criminals; but upon this barbarous condition, that the pardoned man should hang the other two. When power wantons in cruelty it becomes detestable and gives greater offence than even the culprits. The offer was made to the father, being the _enior. As distress is the season for reflection, he replied with meekness, ' was it ever known that a father hanged his children ? How can I take away those lives, which I have given, have cherished, and which of all things are the most dear ?' He bowed, declined the offer, and gave up his life. Barbarous Judges! I am sorry 1 cannot transmit their names to posterity. This noble reply ought to have pleaded his pardon. The offer was then made to the eldest son, who, trembling, answered, ' Though life is the most valuable of all possessions, yet even that may be purchased too dear. I cannot consent to preserve my existence by taking away bis w ho gave it ; nor could I face the world, nor even myself, should I be left the only branch of that family which I had destroyed.' Love, tenderness, compassion, and all the appendages of honour must have associated in returning this answer. The proposition was then of course made to the younger, John, who accepted it with an avidity, that seemed to tell the court, he would hang half the creation, and even his judges, rather mute. A great flood upon the Markeaton brook, carried away the hay, filled the cellars as high as the Angel (Rot- ton-row) and broke down three of the ten bridges. St. James's bridge was landed at the Sun in St. Pe- ter's parish. The apprentices and others assembled, pulled down, and burnt the fences of Henry Mellor's intakes, in Little- field and Castle-field. Some of the rioters were im- prisoned, tried, and fined six-and-eight-pence each. A quarrel between Henry Mellor and the Corporation caused about forty law-suits relative to the above in- closure. A fire at Northampton destroyed most of the town. The inhabitants of Derby, out of compassion, sent them one hundred and fifty pounds ; and Mr. Grey, their town-clerk, twenty. We sometimes behold that singularity of character which joyfully steps out of the beaten track for the sake of being ridiculous: thus the barber, to excite attention, exhibited in his window green, blue and yellow wigs ; and thus Noah Bullock, enraptured with his name, that of the first navigator, and the founder of the"], [654, "616 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER A.

He performed the fatal work without remorse upon his father and brother, and acquitted himself with such dexterity, that he was appointed to the office of hangman in Derby, and two or three neighbouring counties, and continued it to extreme old age. So void of feeling for distress, he . rejoiced at a murder because it brought the prospect of a guinea. Perhaps he was the only l.ian in court who could hear with pleasure the sentence of death. The bodies of the executed were his perquisites : signs of life have been known to return after execution, in which case he prevented the growing existence by violence. (Hutton.) February 9. The hall (of Leicester) ordered George Bent to sue the mayor of Derby, and such as were concerned in taking his heifer on pretence of toll for cattle passing through the said borough ; and the charge of the suit to be paid by the chamberlains. July 12. The hall (of Leicester) ordered that Mr. John Ludham be paid thirty shillings by the chamberlains, for two pigs of lead taken from his father, by the town of Derby for toll. There were frequent riots in favour of the abdicated house of Stuart. Personal insults and broken win- \" With this singular couple, of opposite character, lived an harmless girl, Rosamond OUerenshaw, who, under such an accomplished tutoress, could not be long either ignorant or innocent. \" Hewit and his wife frequented this house separate ly, while Mrs. Beare appeared the friend of both. He was pitied, as groaning under the burden of a hated wife ; and she, as starving under a tyrannical husband. A criminal connexion was supposed, and perhaps with truth, to have taken place between him and both mis tress and maid. This mistress being a wife, could have no future expectations of John ; but the maid had ; however, it was determined between the parties, that Mrs. Hewit must quit the world. Her famished condition exciting the supposed tenderness of Mrs. Beare, she invited her to eat some pancakes ; these were mixed by the mistress, but fried and served up by the maid ; and in them was infused a quantity of arsenic, that in three hours operated in_death. This happened on Saturday. The surgeons\" opened the body ; suspicion fell where it ought ; the town was in a tumult ; and all the parties were committed on Sun day night. \" It is probable Hewit had an affection for Rosa mond ; for at their trial, when he found he could not be saved himself, he endeavoured to save her : the judge having asked her whether Mrs. Beare was privy to the poison, or ordered her to administer it ; John trod upon her toe, that she might tell the truth and save herself ; but she unfortunately mistook the hint for its reverse, and answered ' no ;' by which she saved the life of her mistress, and lost her own. While the two criminals, under sentence, attended di vine service at St. Peter's, John rendered her every civility. Heavily ironed, and half dead with the ap prehension of her approaching fate, she could scarcely rise from her knees, when he took her round the waist in the face of a crowded church, and tenderly raised her. They walked to the place of execution, he in a suit of dark grey with black cuffs and trimmings ; she in a drab gown, and hat which nearly covered her face. I think she hung upon his arm. At the end of their dreadful journey, they both stripped, and appeared in their shrouds. She, unable to stand, rested upon the halter, after being tied up, and expired before the cart moved. He was pitied ; but she lamented. \" Though Mrs. Beare was acquitted, the world were well convinced she was the wicked authoress of that mischief, by which three people had recently lost their lives : they were therefore solicitous to take hers. For this purpose, several indictments were preferred against her, at the next assizes : one, for entering into a treaty with a young fellow to take away his wife, and furnish him with a better ; but he had the pru dence to communicate it to the unsuspecting victim, which defeated the scheme. Another, for receiving five guineas from a lady at Nottingham, to procure abortion. A third\", for destroying the f\u0153tus by the in sertion of an instrument resembling an iron skewer. But though these were crimes of an atrocious nature, and sufficiently blackened by the counsel, yet, being unknown to the law, except by the vague name of mis demeanors, it had not provided an adequate punish ment. This wholesale dealer in human destruction was only sentenced to stand two market-days in the pillory, and sustain three years imprisonment. I saw, her, AugustlS, 1732, with an easy air ascend the hated machine, which overlooked an enraged multitude. All the apples, eggs, and turnips, that could be bought, begged, or stolen, were directed at her devoted head. The stagnant kennels were robbed of their contents, and became the cleanest part of the street. The pil- dows were the result. This wildfire wras fed with combustibles from the pulpit: that spot, which ought to have corrected the errors of man, brought them into action. Sturgcs, of All Saints', prayed publicly for king James ; but after a moment's reflection, '' I mean king George.\" The congregation became tu- multuous ; the military gentlemen drew their swords, and ordered him out of the pulpit, into which he never returned. He pleaded a slip of the tongue ; but if he had dipped into the New Testament, he might have sheltered himself under a better excuse, for we are there commanded \" to pray for our enemies.\" Har- ris, of St. Peter's, was repeatedly called to order by the powerful voice of the magistrates. Cantril, of St. Alkmund's, drank the Pretender's health upon his knees ; and the thirtieth of January became the most holy day in the year. But the wiser Lockett, of St. Michael's, rather chose to amuse himself with mow- ing his grass-plot, than meddling with politics. A weekly paper, under the title of \" The British Spy, or Derby Postman,\" was published by Mr. S. Hodg- kinson, which was discontinued before Mr. Drewry commenced. Several of the first papers, under this title, are now, 1833, in the possession of Mr. Robert Ward, Full-street, Derby. March 23. The first paper, under the title of \"The Derby Mercury,\" was issued by Mr. Samuel Drewry, Market-place, Derby. March 29. John Hewit and Rosamond OUerenshaw were executed for poisoning Hannah Hewit, the wife of John Hewit. They confessed their guilt soon after condemnation. The Rev. Mr. Lockett preached to the prisoners on the 27th instant, from Matthew xxiv. 44. They were both executed in their shrouds, which added to the awfulness of the sight. Mr. Hutton gives the following account: \"John Hewit was a butcher, about thirty, of a moderately fair character, had been married about seven years, was blessed with one daughter, and resided in Step ping-lane ; but he wanting that regard for his wife which is requisite for happiness, and she that prudence necessary to secure his affection, they lived upon ill terms. The same conduct which at first diminishes love, will in time annihilate it. This was the case with our unhappy couple. He treated her with neg lect, with violence, and a diminution of sustenance; and she sought relief in intoxication. \" Eleanor Beare was. a handsome woman, about the same age, with an education superior to her rank, and was mistress of that persuasive eloquence which in sensibly wins over the hearer to her own side. She kept a paltry public-house, the White Horse, nearly opposite the present jail, in the neighbourhood of Hewit. But though she had the cipher of a husband, Ebenezer Beare, yet, as he bore no weight in the"], [655, "OF THE COUNTY OF DERBY. 617 A. D. 1732, A. D, lory, being out of repair, was unable te hold a woman in her prime, whose powers were augmented by ne- cessity : she released herself; and, jumping among the crowd, with a resolution and agility of an amazon, ran down the Morledge, being pelted all the way : new kennels produced new ammunition ; and she appeared a moving heap-of filth. With difficulty they remount- ed her ; and I saw the exasperated brother of the un- fortunate Rosamond pull her with violence mto the pillory by the hair. An human being in distress ex- cites commiseration, whatever is the cause. Her pun- ishment exceeded death. By the time they had fixed her, the hour expired, and she was carried to prison, an object which none cared to touch. \"The next Friday she appeared again, not as a young woman, but an old one, ill, swelled, and de- crepid ; she seemed to have advanced thirty years in one week. The keeper suspecting some finesse from the bulk of her head, took off ten or twelve coverings, among which was a pewter plate, fitted to the head, as a guard against the future storm. He tossed it among the crowd, and left no covering but the hair. The pil- lory being made stronger, and herself being weaker, she was fixed for the hour; where she received the se- vere peltings of the mob ; and they, her groans and her prayers \u2014 She afterwards sustained the three years imprisonment, recovered her health, her spirits, and her beauty ; and at her enlargement was preceded by a band of music.

On Saturday last came to this town George Thomasin, chief of the Maronites, in Syria, with a pe- tition, setting forth that his father, the king of the Maronites, was taken captive by the Turks, upon pre- tence of his not paying his tribute, amounting to 50,000 crowns, and that being unable to raise the said sum, was obliged to desire the assistance of all good christian people. He hath been well received by the courts of France, Flanders, Holland and England, and brought with him a letter from the Duke of Newcas- tle, one of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, which being shown to the Mayor of this borough, he deputed some proper persons to attend him to the chief gen- tlemen's houses in the town. He staid here till Tues- postures, and then returned with great swiftness, sounding a trumpet and firing a pistol, to the great surprise and no less satisfaction of the spectators who were very numerous. The following day, being Fri- day, about two in the afternoon, for the diversion and entertainment ofthe country, and others who had not witnessed this famous artist s performance, he designs to fly down twice and up once, and will divert the spectators with beating a drum as he goes up and flourishing of colours. Mr. Hutton, who witnessed this exploit, gives the following account : \" There are characters who had rather amuse the world, at the hazard us their lives, for a slender and precarious pittance, than follow an honest calling for an easy subsistence. A small figure of a man, seem- ingly composed of spirit and gristle, appeared in Octo- ber, to entertain the town by sliding down a rope. One end of this was to be fixed at the top of All Saints' steeple : and the other at the bottom of St. Michael's ; an horizontal distance of 150 yards, which formed an inclined plane extremely steep. A breast-plate of wood, with a groove to fit the rope, and his own equi- librium, were to be his security, while sliding down upon his belly, with his arms and legs extended. He could not be more than six or seven seconds in this airy journey, in which lie fired a pistol and blew a trumpet. The velocity with which he flew raised a fire by friction, and a bold stream of smoke followed him. He performed this wonderful exploit three suc- cessive days, in each of which he descended twice, and marched up once; the latter took him more than an hour, in which he exhibited many surprising achieve- ments, as sitting unconcerned with his arms folded, lying across the rope upon his hack, then his belly, his hams, blowing the trumpet, swinging round, hanging by the chin, the hand, the heels, the toe, &c. The rope being too long for art to tighten, he might be said to have danced upon the slack. Though he succeed- ed at Derby, yet, in exhibiting soon after at Shrews- bury, he fell, and lost his life. \" Feats of activity are sure to catch the younger part of the world. No amusement was seen but the rope; walls, posts, trees, and houses, were mounted for the pleasure of flying down : if a straggling scaffold pole could he found, it was reared for the convenience of flying ; nay, even cats, dogs, and things inanimate, were applied, in a double sense, to the rope. \"This flying rage was not cured till August, 1734, when another diminutive figure appeared, much older than the first : his coat was in deshabille ; no waist- coat ; his shirt and his shoes the worse for wear ; his hat, worth three-pence, exclusive of the band, which was packthread, bleached white by the w eather ; and a black string supplied the place of buttons to his waistband. He wisely considered, if his performances did not exceed the other's, he might as well stay at, home, if he had one. His rope, therefore, from the same steeple extended to the bottom of St. Mary's- gate, more than twice the former length. He was to draw a wheel-barrow after him, in which was a boy of thirteen. After this surprising performance, an ass was to fly down, armed as before, with a breast-plate, and at each foot a lump of lead about half a hundred. The man, the barrow, and its contents, arrived safe at the end of their journey; when the vast multitude turned their eyes towards the ass, which had been braying several\" days at the top of the steeple for food : but, like many a lofty courtier for a place, brayed in vain : the slackness of the rope, and the great weight of the animal and his apparatus, made it seem, at set ting off, as if he were falling perpendicular. The ap pearance was tremendous ! About twenty yards be fore he reached the gates of the county-hall the rope broke : from the velocity acquired by the descent he bore down all before him. A whole multitude was overwhelmed ; nothing was heard but dreadful cries ; nor seen, but confusion. Legs and arms went to de struction. In this dire calamity, the ass, which maim- day morning, and then set forward for Chesterfield. June 1. The Virgin's Inn, Derby, was robbed. The thief took away a drawer, and robbed a gentleman who lodged in the house of a gold watch, seven guineas, some silver, several shirts, &c. The thief was apprehended the same night at an alehouse on Tapton moor, and the next day lodged safely in the county jail. August 17. John Wainwright and John Blasedale were tried at the county assizes for the murder of Samuel Dobbs, a framework-knitter of Alfreton, and acquit- ted. Ellen Beare, for a misdemeanor in endeavouring to persuade N. Wilson to poison his wife, and giving him poison for that purpose, was found guilty. She was also tried on another serious charge. She was sentenced to stand twice in the pillory and to suffer close imprisonment for three years. The thief who stole the drawer at the Virgin's Inn pleaded guilty of the charge of robbing Captain Woolley, and was sen- tenced to transportation. These were the only prisoners. October 13. Mr. Joseph Frost set out from the Derby market-place and rode to Ashbourn market-place in 55 minutes and a half, having laid a wager that he could ride it in the space of one hour. October 28. The famous Gillinoe, the Frenchman, flew down a rope from the trip of All Saints' church steeple to St. Michael's church, in Derby, which was a dis- tance of 150 yards upon the base. He performed the same (though in a very high wind) with great dexter- ity ; after which he went up the rope again, acting the tailor, shoemaker, &c. and showing several diverting 4 K"], [656, "618 HISTORY AND GAZETTEER A.

At the Derby races on Sinfen moor, seven horses started for a purse of twenty-five guineas on the first day, and three galloways for a purse of fifteen guineas on the second day. There was a great meet- ing of gentry and very good sport both days. The following account is taken from Hutton : \" It is curious to observe Nature step out of her common road, and enter the wonderful. To march in her usual track excites no admiration ; hut when, wanton in her play, she forms an O'Brien of eight feet ; a Borolaski of three ; an admirable Crichton with in St. Werburgh's church, then the only one in Derby \u2022 but though he might perform with judgment, yet the voice, more terrible than sweet, scarcely seemed hu- man.

The hostler at the Virgin's Inn where he resided, having given him disgust, he took one of the kitchen spits from the mantle piece, and bent it round his neck like a handkerchief; but as he did not choose to tuck the ends in the hostler's bosom the cumbrous ornament excited the laugh of the com' Pany, \"11 he condescended to untie his iron cravat.\" 1738, March 30. This day, about one o'clock, Richard Wood- ward, was executed here for being concerned with James Gidders (who was executed at Nottingham on Friday last) for robbings on the highway. He dressed himself in his shroud and walked to the place of exe- cution. June 22. It appears that a new paper, called The Derby Journal, published on Wednesday, was started in op- position to the Mercury. July 5. On Sunday last, the famous quaker, Mrs. Drummond, was carried from the King's Head, in 1 this town, in a chariot to the county hall, where she preached to abundance of people, both morning and evening. July 13. On Monday morning last, between three and four o'clock, a shock of an earthquake was felt by a great many of the inhabitants of this town, and ac- cording to reports, was also felt for several miles round at the same time, and that an old barn was thrown down by it at Caldwell, belonging to Samuel Sanders, esq. of that place. 1739, March 22. This evening the assiies ended, before Lord Chief Baron Page, when Mr. James Loton, of Eden- sor, in the county of Derby, a man of a good appear- ance and considerable substance, was try d and found guilty of the murder of a male bastard child, by drowning it, and received sentence of death, and to be hanged in chains. It appears from the subsequent papers, that great interest was made on his behalf to save his life. He was respited no less than six times, and finally, in the month of August, received a free pardon, when he immediately went home to his family. 1740, January 24. Mr. F'letcher and other owners of the col- lieries at Heanor, Smalley and Denby, having been accused of monopolizing the sale of coals, stoutly deny the imputation, and offer to supply any persons with coals at 2s. Sd. to 3s. per ton, for forty years to come, and to give security for the performance ofthe same. March 27. The bill to restrain and prevent the excessive increase of horse races in the kingdom, passed both houses of parliament. Before this, races were annual- ly held at Alfreton, Bakewell, Wirksworth and Tides- well, most of them continued three days. April 9. William Dolphin was executed at Derby for robbing Mr. Lord on the highway, near Chesterfield. He was a single man, 33 years of age, well proportion- ed, and of a strong and healthful constitution. He walked to the gallows betwixt two clergymen, reading all the way. He declared himself innocent to the last. July 10, Derby. On Monday last, in the afternoon, two wagons, containing twenty-four sacks of fine flour, be- longing to Mr. William Evans and Mr. Isaac Turner, which were loaded here, set forward in order to pro- ceed to Leek, in Staffordshire. The populace being informed what was done, immediately pursued and overtook the said wagons about two mile.- from hence, where they stopped the horses ; the noise of this affair spreading soon raised the people of the neighbouring towns, who came in upon them apace, as well as from Derby, so that in a very short time an infinite number of people were got together, who soon began to plun- der and cut open the bags of flour, the women filling their aprons, bags or other things they brought to carry it away ; and by the great hurry and confusion, sad havoc and waste was made of it : however, through the great care and indefatigable pains of Thomas Gisborne, esq. he prevailed with them to let every accomplishment ; or a John Crosland with none ; it raises astonishment. \" We learnt from private accounts, well attested, that Thomas Topham, a man who kept a public house at Islington, performed surprising feats of strength ; as breaking a broomstick, of the first magnitude, by striking it against his bare arm ; lifting two hogs- heads of water ; heaving his horse over the turnpike gate; carrying the beam of a house, as a soldier his firelock, &c. But, however belief might stagger, she soon recovered herself when this second Sampson ap- peared at Derby, as a performer in public, at a shil- ling each. Upon application to Alderman Cooper, for leave to exhibit, the magistrate was surprized at the feats he proposed : and, as his appearance was like that of other men, he requested him to strip, that he might examine whether he was made like them; but he was found to be extremely muscular. What were hollows under the arms and hams of others, were fill- ed up with ligaments in him. He appeared near live feet ten, turned of thirty, well made, but nothing sin- gular ; he walked with a small limp. He had former- ly laid a \"wager, the usual decider of disputes, that three horses could not draw him from a post, which he should clasp with his feet ; but the driver giving them a sudden lash, turned them aside, and the unex- pected jerk broke his thigh. The performances of this wonderful man, in whom were united the strength of twelve, were, rolling up a pewter dish of seven pounds, as a man rolls up a sheet of paper \u2014 holding a pewter quart at arms length and squeezing the sides together like an egg shell \u2014 lifting 200 wt. with his little finger, and moving it gently over his head. The bodies he touched seemed to have lost their powers of gravitation. He also broke a rope, fastened to the floor, that would sustain 20 cwt.. \u2014 lifted an oak table six feet long with his teeth, though half a cwt. was hung to the extremity : a piece of leather was fixed to one end fur his teeth to hold, two of the feet stood upon his knees, and he raised the end with the weight higher than that in his mouth. He took Mr. Cham- bers, vicar of All Saints', who weighed 27 stone, and raised him with one hand, his head being laid on one chair and his feet on another, four people, 1-Lstone each, sat upon his body, which he heaved at pleasure \u2014 he struck a round bar of iron, one inch diameter, against his naked arm, and at one stroke b.nt it like a bow.

August 7- At the Derby assizes George Ashmore re- ceived sentence of death for coining, Elizabeth Bear and Elizabeth Bell, were sentenced to seven years transportation for being concerned in the late riots ; Samuel Gilbert was convicted of stealing a mare, and James Hill, for being concerned with Dolphin (lately executed) in robbing Mr. Lord: the two last were condemned, but reprieved. A very remarkable case happened here during the sitting of the court : one William Jones having, at Nottingham assizes, stolen a livery coat belonging to one of the Judge's servants, had the assurance to appear v ith it on his back in a public manner at Derby assizes, and being discovered, was seized and committed, of which notice being given to Judge Probyn, he was brought before him, tryed, convicted, and sentenced to be transported. August 28. George Ashmore was executed, and the fol- lowing day he was decently interred at Sutton on the Hill. His body was stolen from the grave by some body snatchers. August 3L On Saturday last, the three men and three women sentenced for transportation at the last assizes, were carried on horseback to Liverpool in order to be shipped off\" to some of his majesty's plantations abroad. December 11. Great flood in Derby. On Tuesday last we had the greatest inundation of water here that ever was known, occasioned by the falling of a great quan- tity of snow and rain, which began on Sunday in the afternoon and continued (almost without intermission) till Tuesday morning, at which time several streets, and all the rooms upon the ground floors were laid a great depth under water. Great damage has been done not only to the houses, furniture, &c. but several walls have been thrown down, bridges and great quan- tities of wood carried away, and numbers of cattle swept from the pastures, have perished. The parish church' of St. Werburgh's received considerable damage, it having made so great a breach in the pave- ment throughout the church, that it must be new paved. At Alvaston a man attempting to save his cattle, perished. March 2ti. Between four and five o'clock this morning a sire broke out at the Virgin's Inn here, which being perceived by some persons in the street, they immedi- ately alarmed the whole neighbourhood by the outcry of fire, which was repeated in a dismal manner from the windows of the said Inn, by the servants, &c. who found a wainscoted room all in flames. A gentleman who lay over the said room calling out for help, was taken out of the chamber window by the assistance of a ladder, and his life saved thereby. The engines be- ing sent for and assistance coming from all parts of the town, it was happily extinguished about seven o'clock. It has done considerable damage to some of the rooms and furniture of the said Inn ; and as at first it seem- ed to spread, having made its way into Mr. Aleynell's, the adjoining house, his goods were all brought into the market-place, as were the goods of the present mayor, whose house was next, and several other neighbours were carrying away their effects to prevent their being destroyed. August 1. Robert Bowler was executed, pursuant to his sentence at the last assizes, for shooting and dan- gerously wounding Edward Uivington, a butcher, as he was \"going from Belper to Pentrich. November 25. Lord Massareen was married at St. Pe- ter's church, Derby, to Miss Eyre, which was a gene- ral fast day. This caused the following epigram to be published in the Mercury of the 27th of November. 1742, March 11. Derby election for a member in lieu of Lord James Cavendish. The candidates were Lord Vis- count Duncannon, son-in-law of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, and German Pole, esq. The poll con- tinued open on Saturday and Monday. This contest was carried on in a peaceable manner though it was the strongest that had taken place for many years. Mr. Pole complained of undue influence having been used, and attempted to set aside the election, and on April 3, the mayor, several of the aldermen, &c. (a great many burgesses having gone the week before) set out from the Ge6rge for London, to attend the house of commons on Friday next, the time appointed for hearing Mr. Pole's petition, complaining of an undue election for this borough ; but they were pre- vented pursuing their journey further than Market H?rborough, by the reception of a special messenger, the same night, from his Grace the Duke of Devon- shire, acquainting them that Mr. Pole had withdrawn his petition, upon which they set out the next morn- ing on their return to Derby, where they were receiv- ed with great joy by all the real friends of His Grace, and his son-in-law, the Lord Duncannon. The same evening all the bells were rung, bonfires made, and other tokens of joy shown. June 8. German Pole, e.sq. gave a great entertainment upon a pleasant spot of ground near his seat at Rad- bourn, to the burgesses and others, who were his friends at the late election for this borough, where was great plenty of provisions and liquor; nearly five hun- dred persons sat down to dinner. The squire attend- ed by several gentlemen, dined also in public with * them. ' June 24. The first advertisement of a sale by auction in the Derby Mercury, is a freehold estate, consisting of nine houses, &c. to be held at the Virgin's Inn. August 19. At Derby assizes the following curious cuuse was tried. A tanner's dog invited another dog of his intimate acquaintance to an entertainment, but the latter dog not being satisfied with his feast, as he came away feloniously stole away the strunt of a tail, \u2022 and the tanner's dog soon after hearing of the felony, quarreled with his acquaintance, upon which he hist his life ; whereupon the tanner, in vindication of his deceased dog, and in regard to the civility of the de- ceased to his companion, brought his action, and, after a long debate, the jury brought in their verdict fur the plaintiff, and allowed him two-pence for the strunt. But the most material evidence was, that he saw the defendant's dog lick his lips as he came from the table, and ran away with the strunt. The law seems to ha \\ e been at a low ebb, when a strunt is made the subject of litigation. 1/45, March 29. On Tuesday last Mr. William Tatam, a cut- ler and razor maker, Sadler-gate, Derby, being at work at his grindstone, which was turning with great rapidity, when on a sudden it broke in pieces and fractured his skull in so terrible a manner that he died in about twoliours after. July 5. This morning John Graham and Ignatius Fisher, the two noted highwaymen lately taken at Chesterfield, were taken to Nottingham from our county jail, in a cart well guarded, to be tried. They were tried for robbing Mr. Smith, a butcher, on the forest, as he was returning from Mansfield market. They were found guilty, and hanged at Nottingham. December 4, five o'clock.

He was of a gener ous public spirit, on which account his death is much lamented. the house floor, and extinguished itself imperceptibly ; though there were six or seven persons in the room at the same time, who received no damage thereby. At another house in the same yard, it tore a large piece of wood from a beam, fixed at a gable end of the said house, split the window shutters, and broke the win dows there. February 2fi. Last Saturday night some rogues broke off and carried away several brass knockers from off the doors of some gentlemen's houses in the Wardwick and Friar-gate ; and last night the same was repeated at a gentleman's door in the Iron-gate, and some other small robberies were committed about the same time. 1750, Nov. 30. There appears to he a bad disease amongst the horses in Derby and neighbourhood at this time, which was not very fatal. 1752, Feb. 21. On the night of the 13th, betwixt six and seven o'clock, four prisoners broke out of the County jail, at Derby, by making a breach through the bottom part of the wall of the said jail, and then breaking the ground, came through upon the bridge. The next morning Anthony Frost, a felon, was foun_ in the prison,- having voluntarily returned again to his old quarters the same night, in as private a manner as he escaped, by getting into the jail again through the same hole he went out at. It does not appear that the other three were again apprehended. March 19. Last Friday, about noon, a violent storm of wind and rain happened here, which we hear was at- tended with much thunder and lightning in the neighbourhood ; whereby the stable of Mr. William Holden, of Nether Thurvaston, about five miles from hence, was set on fire, which in a short time con- sumed it and burnt a great part of his house, and household goods, besides destroying a quantity of corn, cheese, &c. April 8. Last Saturday morning died Miss Catherine Bayley, daughter to the late Thomas Bayley, esq. who was Member of Parliament for this town, and niece to the present Sir Wolstan Dixie, bart. It is im- possible to do this lady's character justice : she had a form given her above most mortals : but she never let vanity be the result of it: her chief care was to let it express the noble mind that inhabited this beauteous structure. She had the cardinal virtues united in her : February 27. An advertisement, signed Humphrey Booth, esq. mayor, states, that the magistrates have had notice that the football playing on the 3rd of March has_lately been notifyed and proclaimed in towns and counties adjacent. They therefore direct and order \"that no riotous or tumultuous meeting of persons (and more especially of foreigners, at the un- happy time of contageon amongst horned cattle) do appear at the time, and for the purpose aforesaid, in the said borough, on pain of being prosecuted for the same, as well as for the consequences of breaking windows, &c. July 2. On Saturday last came on the election for the borough. September 10. On Wednesday, the 2nd instant, one Cooper, of Thurlston, who was married at Derby but the day before, murdered his wife the first night he lay with her, by first strangling her with a garter, and then cutting her throat with a penknife, for which he was last Thursday committed to the county jail. October 23. According to the account delivered to his Majesty's Justices of the Peace, at their Special Ses- sions, held at the King's Head, on Friday last, the dis- tempered horned cattle on the south side of the Trent, in part of the hundred of Repton and Gresley, stood thus, infected 659, killed 128, died 290, recovered 241 : this disease was called the murrain. This dis- which, with her wisdom and piety, enabled her to bear her Creator's pleasure, in this dbode of trials, till she was permitted to receive the reward of the righteous. It may truly be said, though she was very young, she was worthy to be imitated by persons of all ages. All the consolation her acquaintance have, is to reflect on her happiness, and to practise her vir- tues, which will be their gain. Sept. 29. Mr. Furmston, the modern living Colossus, or the wonderful giant, exhibited himself at the Blackmoor's Head, in Derby. 1753, Feb. 23. Last Tuesday, in St. Alkmund's church-yard, died Mrs. Warren, aged 104. She was a maiden gen- tlewoman, and a relation to Borlase Warren, esq. of Stapleford, in the county of Nottingham, it is re- markable that she retained her senses to the last, par- ticularly her sight and hearing, in a very remarkable order prevailed in other parts of the kingdom. August 6. Derby races on Sinfen moor, for three sub- scription purses of \u00a350. each : at which there was a great -meeting of gentlemen and others each day, and the diversion gave greaf satisfaction to the spectators, being conducted with great regularity and order. It appears to have been customary at this time for the horses to run three heats ; notwithstanding the two first were won by one horse. This was the case on each of the three days at these races.

Several concertos and solos will be per- formed on the French horns, and other instruments never heard before. December 23. Election of a member for the borough began on last Monday and ended on Tuesday night, when Thomas Rivitt, esq. was chosen. The whole was carried on with great order and tranquillity, not- withstanding the great concourse of people. March 17. At the Derby Assizes, four men and a wo- man were sentenced to be transported for seven years. After sentence were passed on the above five, several of them behaved in a most audacious and insolent manner, cursing and damning the whole court, where- upon Judge Birch ordered the sheriff's men to at- tend them to the jail. April 28. Rejoicing for the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. July 31. Widow Raynor's Company of rope dancers intends to exhibit several new performances, by the celebrated Miss Raynor and others, next week, at a large booth in the White Hart, in Iron-gate. August 2nd. On Tuesday last, about six in the even- ing, we had one of the most terrible tempests of lightning, thunder and rain, that was ever known ; the lightning, or (some say) a fire ball made its way down a chimney into the house of one James Charles- worth, a gardener, the back-side of Walker lane, and split a deal box all to shivers: it also split a Hint stone that was in the said box ; after which it ran along manner. April fi. Theatrical critique on the Derby Comedians, to the Printer of the Derby paper. \" I have been the two last nights to see that celebrated tragedy of the immortal Shakspeare, performed by your Derby com- pany of comedians, and to my great surprise, saw it surprisingly done, beyond my expectations, especially in so small a theatre (the old Assembly-room) and out of London. Romeo's youth, figure and design in act- ing and address, showed his genius and his educa- tion. Juliet in performance bespoke her more than a vulgar terin'd strolling actress. Mercutio, a wild gal- lant, was my pleasure in his performance ; and Kryar Lawrence's years, gravity and honest character in the play bespeak an instruction to youth, and impres- sion on the audience. In fine, the whole play was acted well, clothed decently, and well conducted. I am, __c.\" April H.

May 4. Dramatic performance last Monday evening, at the Free Grammar School, Derby, for the benefit of the Orphans of the late Usher; when the tragedy of Cato was performed by the young Gentlemen of the said School, and the following prologue, written for the occasion, by a young gentleman of 16 years of age, a pupil of the said school, was spoken by Master George Paschall. broke out in the year 1756, between the English and French nations ; which, at the beginning, was badly conducted; till that truly great statesman, William Pitt, esq. took upon him the management of affairs, when this nation seemed to be on the brink of ruin. From the moment of his administration every depart ment became spirited; and success attended our arms, in every quarter of the globe, by sea and land. Du ring which the English took and destroyed almost the whole of their fleets, landed often on their coasts ; and for many years, never had less than twenty-five or thirty thousand of their seamen prisoners, who were allowed by the King of Great Britain sixpence each man per day. During this glorious war, the com merce of the nation was never known to be greater, while the finances ofthe Grand Monarque was much reduced, and the poverty of his subjects so great, as wholly to incapacitate them from affording these peo ple any manner of relief. These men were dispersed into many parts of the nation. Three hundred being sent on parole to this town about July, 1759, where they continued till the end of the war, in 1763. Their behaviour at first was impudent and insolent; at all times vain and effeminate; and their whole deport ment light and unmanly \u2014 and we may venture to say, from our observation and knowledge of them, that in any future war, this nation has nothing to fear from them as an enemy. During their abode here, the road from this place to Nottingham was by Act of Parlia ment repaired ; the part from St. Mary's bridge (which by reason of the floods was impassable) being greatly raised ; \u2014 numbers of these people were daily employed, who worked in their bag-wigs, pig-tails, ruffles', &c. &c. a mattej which afforded us much mer riment. But to their honour let it be remembered, that scarce one act of fraud or theft was committed by any of them, during their stay among us. No Garriek here majestic treads the stage, No Quin your whole attention to engage; No practised actor here the scene employs, But a raw parcel of unskilful boys. Shall we disfigur'd in a school-boy see Cato's great soul in base epitome ? Can critics bear such slavery as this ? Would not e'en Cato join the critic's hiss ? What shall we say then ? what excuses make ? Our credit and success lie both at stake. As when some peasant, who to treat his lord, Brings out his little stock, and decks his board With what his ill-stor'd cupboard will afford, With awkward bows, and ill-plac'd rustic airs, To make excuses for his feast prepares; So we with tremor mix'd with vast delight, View the bright audience which appears to-night. And, conscious of its meanness, hardly dare To bid you welcome to our homely fare. But would the ladies in our cause appear, One look would silence every critic here. If you but smile, 'twill cheer our tim'rous hearts, And give us courage to perform our parts. To you, ye fair ones, then, we make address, And beg protection for this night's success; Look gently on our faults, and where we fail, Let pity to our tender youth prevail. Our cause is in your hands; and Cato, who Disdain'd great C\u00e6sar's yoke, submits to you. June 20th, 1763.

Last Saturday, at Derby, betwixt twelve and one o'clock, Mary Dilkes was (pursuant to her sen- tence at the late assizes, for the murder of her bastard child) carried in a cart from the jailer's house to the usual place of execution, where she was executed amidst a vast number of spectators, after which her body was taken down, and being put again in the cart, was brought to the county hall for dissection. A new gallows was erected on this occasion. This was the only female executed in Derby from that time to the year 1819, a period of sixty-five years.

They offer a reward of two guineas for the discovery of the writer ; and further add, That if any burgi-ss or other persons shall go in. or any ways assist any rioters, in case they come to this place, siich burgesses shall be immediately disfranchised, and such other persons shall be prosecuted and punished with the utmost rigour of the law ; all proper care being taken to keep the markets for corn and all other pro- visions as low and reasonable as the present times will allow of. About this time riots had taken place at Atherstune, Birmingham, Tamworth and Notting- ham : the principal attack was made on corn mills. It may not hereafter be an unacceptable anecdote to re- cite the following particulars relative to the war which At the summer assizes there was only one female to take her trial. The Duke of Devonshire arrived in Derby, being the first time after his coming of age. He was accompa- nied by his uncles, the Lords George, Frederic and John Cavendish, his brother, Lord Richard, the Polish ambassador, &c. ; and gave grand entertainments at the George, King's Head, and Greyhound, to the no- bility, gentlemen and tradesmen of the town and neighbourhood. At night he gave a ball to the ladies and gentlemen in the New Assembly-room : the com- pany at which was numerous and brilliant. His Grace opened the ball with the Hon. Miss Vernon, daughter of Lord Vernon, of Sudbury. At the races, on Sinfen moor, there was the greatest number of nobility and gentry of the first rank ever known.
