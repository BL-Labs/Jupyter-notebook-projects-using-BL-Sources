Though these insular parts of the British empire are of small extent, compared with what, in respect of them, may be termed the mainland, and small even as compared with some of the Scottish isles, yet they are spots of much and varied interest. They are this, in every point of view in which they can be contemplated ; and that man must be mindless indeed, who is not interested in their description, or delighted with a visit to them, or to any one of them. The beauty of their scenery holds out a strong attraction to the mere lover of sights. Their healthful breezes, and the careering and glittering waters which encompass their shores \u2014 shores which are striking at every point and at most points sublime, render them more than medicine to the in valid ; for in these he may purify himself in nature's own bath, and in that he may inhale something more renovating than ever chemist distilled from alembic. To those who give themselves up to toil and trouble \u2014 whether of business or of fashion, for eleven live-long months of the year, in the mud and murkiness of the metropolis, the twelfth month \u2014 B"], [16, "4 INTRODUCTION. not the last month of the year certainly \u2014 spent, or rather saved, in any of those Islands, no matter which, would be, in real enjoyment, worth all the other eleven. To the stu dent of nature, that is, of the living productions of nature, they offer a triple enjoyment ; for he may, in one and the same morning, study the products of the land, of the sea, and of that region of perpetual spring the tidal beach, which is alternately under the dominion of the one and the other, and whose plants and animals are therefore the true am phibia of nature. To him whose love of creation is more fervent and deep, and who desires to understand, from their results, those workings of natural power which, when they are in action, are too mighty for mortal view, these islands offer a higher treat than is perhaps to be met with in any other part of the kingdom, and certainly more than is to be met with anywhere else in England. Everywhere through out the country, and indeed throughout all countries, we can perceive that things as they now exist, have been brought into their present condition by a series of operations of far more energetic nature than that common surface-action which we see carried on from day to day, by the sun, the atmosphere, and the ordinary motion and distribution of the waters ; but throughout England generally, we see only one side of the question \u2014 the changed, but not the changer. In these Islands, however, we see both ; and the sea has oblig ingly worked their shores into such bold escarpments, that we can read them as a book while we sail or travel along. Future opportunities will offer for our entering a little, though only a very little, into the details ; but we may, in the meantime, just hint at the tale of an epoch long gone by, which the cliffy shores of these delightful little Islands have to tell. In great part of the Isle of Wight, the strata, not only the chalk, and the oolite, and other formations under the chalk, but the tertiary formation, whether marine, estuaral, or lacustrine, which overlays the chalk, have been heaved upwards from beneath, until they stand almost on edge;"], [17, "5 INTRODUCTION. and it seems to have been in this way, or, at all events, in this part of the Channel, that the disruption of England from the continent was begun, \u2014 whether that beginning took place before or after the land was raised above the sur face of that ocean whose waters must have rolled over it during the lapse of centuries Avhich we cannot number. Then, in the Channel Islands, we have vestiges of at least one of the instruments employed by nature in uplifting the land, and breaking or tending to break its continuity. There are some primary rocks in those islands \u2014 not primary in their materials ; for in the materials of creation, there is no first and no last \u2014 all are the productions of one Almighty fiat, which called them into perfection in briefer time than the finger could point, or the eye twinkle. Neither are they primary as forming part of the upper rock which im mediately supports the plant-bearing soil ; for the position of the strata in the Isle of Wight shows that even the up per tertiary beds were deposited before the Guernsey gra nite, as it is designated, arose in its power from the depths of the earth, and modelled and disposed of the surface-strata, according to the pleasure of Him, before whose agents all the armies that ever were mustered by men, are more light and helpless than thistle-down on the wing of the hurri cane. What may have occurred between those primary points of rock, and the upheaved strata in the Isle of Wight, we shall not now enquire. But nature is competent to the task ; and in our own times there have been among the giant mountains of America outpourings of volcanic mud and water, which would have been quite adequate to the scoop ing out of the Channel, and the dispersion of the displaced materials far and wide along the shores of the land, or over the bottom of the sea. We mention these matters, not because it is our intention to go formally into the geology of all, or of any, of these Is lands ; but just in order to show that they are linked toge ther by nature, by a tie which makes each one explanatory b 2"], [18, "6 INTRODUCTION. of the others. Nor will it fail to strike every reflective reader, how curious it is, that, even in a civil sense of the word, those Islands which nature has thus connected, would not be dissevered. When the Conqueror \u2014 it is more correct to say the coming, for Harold was the usurper \u2014 got possession of England, along with Normandy, the small isles in the Channel, as being more proximate to Normandy, belonged to that ; and the inhabitants were, and are still, in manners, in appearance, and in speech, the same people as the Nor mans. But when the successors of William lost their French provinces, or, to express it more truly, when the people of England got rid of the burden of those provinces, \u2014 of the expence of paying for keeping them by main force out of the hands of their natural sovereign, the people of those little isles clung to England, and they have continued to do so to this day, and with a dialect of foreigners on their lips, have stood longer and more sturdily for their pre rogative of Englishmen, than perhaps ever was done by so mere a handful of people. It is true that nature has fenced their lovely little dwellings with the munition of rocks, and it may be equally true that the attraction of one islander to ward another is more powerful than either toward a conti nental; but still the conduct ofthe Channel islanders, though a small, is a sweet flower in the chaplet of well-maintained national independence. These are matters which the vulgar, whether great or small, learned or unlearned, are very apt to overlook, though, to the reflective, they have greater charms than the mere gratification of the senses, pure and purifying as is the sen sual gratification which all who have human bodies cannot fail in deriving from the mere sight of such lovely scenes as meet one at every turn in these Islands. There is indeed one, though only one, description of persons to whom this portion of sensual enjoyment avails not, \u2014 they who emulate the dog, and have more pleasure in the scent of carrion, than in all the beauty and fragrance of nature's own parterre. Even such have no occasion to shun the Islands under con-"], [19, "7 INTRODUCTION. sideration ; for we can assure them that entertainment for man and beast \u2014 conjointly or severally, is nowhere better, or more easily obtained. It is unquestionably not for such, that these chosen spots of nature were formed ; and yet we know of few places which are better calculated to inspire good taste and kindly feel ings, with love and kindness for all that lives, than those for which we proffer the humble task of cicerone. As for those whom we would most wish to please, our task with them will be a light one ; for we shall have only to point the way, and they themselves will find out the enjoyment \u2014 and it will be all the more sweet and gratifying, that we do not break in upon the train of their reflections. To begin at the beginning then, the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands, the proximate parts of Hampshire, and the interjacent waters must be held as per eminence, the tour, or the summer retreat, \u2014 as time and other circum stances may render them, or any portion of them, available. We shall suppose, that the grand South Western Railway is completed ; and its completion will be near, or haply ar rived at, before our lighter labours are at an end ; and then we may say that the Isle of Wight will be as near to Lon don as South End or Woolwich had wont to be. From St. Paul's to Southampton pier, the distance will not be four hours, or anything like it, and the rails upon this line are so well laid, the materials under them, in general, so sound, and the engineers and all employed so au fait at their business, that trundling along is as easy and safe as being borne in an Indian palanquin. There is no danger, no trouble, no need of expense on the road ; for one has only to sit down at London, read the double broad sheet of the Times or the Chronicle, and before one gets to the Co lophon, one may rise up at Southampton, and gladden one's eyes with the sweetest compound of sea and land that is any where to be met with. Not much is to be seen by the way, although much ofthe intervening country is very beautiful ;"], [20, "8 INTRODUCTION. but this is all the better, inasmuch as one feels the full force of the contrast. The ride to Portsmouth is shorter than this in distance, and some twice the length in time. It is different, but we will not say better or worse \u2014 chaque un a son gout. At the last-named place, there are the mighty memorials of the British navy ; and at the first there is a choice of the beau ties of nature. A lover of forests, and of the memories of things gone by, may take the New Forest in his way to the Island, and here he has a choice of trips, all of them of the most varied character ; perfect novelties to such as have been accustomed to towns and ploughed fields only. One may take this western tour of the Forest \u2014 through the northern parts to the Avon, thence to Christchurch, and so on to Lymington \u2014 having a delightful view of the Island on the latter part of the way. Then the passage to Yar mouth is but a mere ferry ; and \" mine host of the Bugle,\" though his house is the smaller, is an excellent ornitholo gist for the museum, \u2014 or the table. Again, one may take the centre tour quite through Lyndhurst, the metropolis of the Forest, or the eastern one, through woods and waters and memorials of monks ; and the sea-passage and land-fall are the same in all. These routs are all quite different ; and, as they are all beautiful in their way, we should say that the longest is the best \u2014 enjoyment being measured by the mile in this part of the country : and there is this ad vantage connected with them that, while they are admira ble in themselves, and quite a treat to those who can go no further, they do not, to any extent, spoil the main subject ; any more than its several parts destroy the effect of each other. If the Isle of Wight is the chief object, the best and quickest way is to steam or sail onwards to Cowes ; and so get into the middle of the Island, after a very short trip, which may be made either by land or by boat up the river Medina. On the voyage from Southampton to Cowes, the"], [21, "9 INTRODUCTION. Channel is never so wide as to throw either shore into dim distance, nor are the shores so approachable by anything save a mere skiff, that the objects on land can be hid by the mere mud-wall of the shore. Hence, there is an ad vantage over what can be enjoyed in skirting along the single coast of even the richest country,\u2014 as, when the pas senger tires of the one side, he has only to turn his glance to the other. The succession of landscapes, on both hands, is good ; and indeed there is a panorama of exquisite scenery nearly all the way. This approach to the Isle of Wight, and that island itself, lie at the vestibule of all the voyages, unless those to the north of Europe. To France, this is by much the most delightful way by which the pleasure-tourist can reach France or any part of the Continent through France ; and it is also the best from which to take shipping for the south and south-west of the world, whatever may be the final des tination. From Southampton to Havre is only 124 miles on the direct line ; and from Portsmouth it is less. The dis tance to Jersey is 122 ; and in moderate weather there is not the least danger in any of the trips across the Channel. Generally speaking too, it is a bustling sea, never without craft of some kind or other, unless when the fury of the south-west is up. The narrow seas are especially calm and safe in all ordinary weather ; and yet the water is never stag nant. If there is no wind to curl the water, there is a cur rent running gently the one way or the other, with very little pause ; because the double ebb and flow keep up a continual motion, and light barks can thus glide along with out much assistance from the wind. This movement of the water keeps the air stirring in gentle zephyrs, even at times when there is no motion of its general mass, and this gives a healthiness to the whole place, which is perhaps not equalled upon any other coast in the country. To the inha bitants of the western parts of central England generally, and to those of the metropolis in particular, it must be an inestimable advantage, that a trip to the Isle of Wight has"], [22, "10 INTRODUCTION. been reduced to the brief measure of a morning's ride, at no labour, and very little expense. This Island will, of course, be the grand place of resort ; and it has the advan tage that visitors can set up their temporary staff in the exposure or the scene which likes them best, and yet be able to command all the variety by which they are sur rounded, which variety is so great, that it cannot be ex hausted in many weeks \u2014 even in many months. There is this advantage too, that no one place of summer resort in the Island is so large that those who resort to it can impair its real beauty and enjoyment, by spoiling it with the freaks of town. At Ryde, there has been a little threat ening of this, and the rural quietude has been in some mea sure broken in upon by buildings and manners which are assuredly not in keeping with the place. Even on the south-east, where the Island and the sea are the whole visi ble world, a few spots have most unwisely got a good deal of the townish air ; but notwithstanding, we may hope that the lease of nature in these parts is still good for a century to come. Still another circumstance may be mentioned, wherein the resort of much additional company to the Isle of Wight, during the season of rural and marine enjoyments, will be as conducive to the moral health of the Island, as to the physical health of the visitors. It must not be understood that the humbler class of the people here, especially those upon the coast of the back of the Island, which is the true place to go to, were like the simple inhabitants of some pastoral district, far in the hills, whose manners would be in peril from a little of the vice of town servants. On the contrary, they have for many years been smugglers \u2014 a class of persons, who, taken upon the whole, must, under any circumstances, be both wretched and vicious ; so that any change which can happen them, be it what it may, must be a change for their good. \" He must,\" says the pro verb, \" be a very good man who can afford to cheat another without being the worse for it ;.\" and, a fortiori, he must be"], [23, "11 INTRODUCTION. a still better man who can live by the habitual practice of cheating his country, and be quite honest towards his neigh bours. The law against which the smuggler offends may be impolitic and unjust \u2014 between which there is little dif ference in the case of a revenue law ; and we hesitate not to say that the law, in virtue of which the people of the Isle of Wight were made smugglers, was, and is, a very impolitic law ; but still the moral guilt, and the demoralising conse quences, are just the same to the individual when he breaks a bad law, as when he breaks a good one. If the law is bad, by all means get it repealed in the proper way ; but, as long as it is the law, obey it. While the temptation to smuggle remains, the labouring classes never will acquire, and never can be expected to acquire, regular and industrious habits, \u2014 more especially if wines or spirituous liquors form part ofthe articles smuggled. On such a coast as the back of the Isle of Wight, twice or ten times the revenue on the smuggled articles, and even as many times their value, could not prevent smuggling ; for that coast is such as that it cannot be guarded, excepting at a few points. Therefore, unless for the resort of strangers, the humbler classes would continue their smuggling propen sities, and their disregard and dislike of honest labour. But the resort of company to the new villages, which villages can not be too generally spread around this particular coast, will gradually train the people to industrious habits ; a tone of moral feeling will be generated along with those habits ; and the people will cease to have any desire to waste their time or to peril their lives and safety, by so demoralising a pur suit. That government should, by reducing the duty, put an end to the smuggling at once, would unquestionably be the wiser and the better plan ; but the next to it, is raising the people's tone and character by other means, and the means which we have mentioned, are perhaps the best for the ac complishment of such a purpose. Coast smuggling, in so small a place as the Isle of Wight, is not only injurious to the morals ofthe people on the shores ; c"], [24, "12 INTRODUCTION. for the distance is so short, that it extends its baneful influ ence through the whole Island ; and therefore every part will be advantaged by its abolition, whether politically or morally \u2014 by force it never can completely be done. Now, there is no reason why the means which we have suggested \u2014 or rather mentioned, for they need no suggestion, should not be extended equally to the inland villages as to the coast, by a general distribution of seasonable visitors all over the Is land. We shall have occasion to mention these villages more particularly afterwards ; but we may say that all of them are very rural and pleasant, and some perfectly de lightful ; and that there is little squalor and misery about them to offend the eyes of those who are more prone to take offence at the sight of poverty than to relieve it. Indeed, we feel quite convinced that, when the propensity to smug gling shall be cured, the peasantry of the Isle of Wight will be inferior to none in England, either for comfortable enjoy ment, or for moral worth. They have, generally speaking, a rich soil, and a delightful climate, which together are ca pable of rewarding their industry to the fullest extent ; and though, even in their present state, we have no desire to find fault with them, or to describe them as being worse than others; yet it would be very delightful if, charming as the place is, in a physical point of view, the appearance and cha racter of the humbler classes of the people were the grand predominating charm. This would not only be very de lightful in as far as they themselves are concerned, but it might be wholesome and not altogether unprofitable to those who resort thither for their annual relaxation and recovery of tone ; \u2014 for we do not bring a very severe, or very unfounded censure against these parties, when we say that they would not enjoy themselves less rationally, by carrying a quiet rural vir tue or two home with them from the country, and having it in their power to be as loud and as learned in praise of the dramatis person\u00e6 as of the scene, when business or pleasure demands that that scene should be shifted. Though the Isle of Wight was at one time a sort of sepa-"], [25, "13 INTRODUCTION. rate holding, though upon one occasion the Lord of it had it to himself, and though it still has its Governor in name, though slightly, if at all, in power, yet there is nothing to dis- tinguish it from the adjacent parts of the mainland, saving perhaps that the people are more exclusively Norman in their blood and aspect. It is true that they have some pe- culiarities of speech, both in words and in pronunciation; but still these are not greater than we sometimes meet with in two adjoining counties, or even in two distant districts of the same county. Thus, for instance, if one part of a county is upland and bleak, and another is low-lying, rich, and damp, one who is observant, and possesses a discriminating ear, can distinguish a native and resident of the one place, from a native and resident of the other, by the difference of the tones of their voices. This, though not generally notic- ed, is what we might be prepared to expect; for the at- mosphere which a human being has used from in breathing and in speaking, must have some influence in mo difying the organs of speech, and by necessary consequence, the language. There can hardly be anything of this kind generally applicable to the Isle of Wight ; because the soil there is exceedingly diversified, and the diversities are so proximate to each other in place, that their influence must be blended together in almost every individual. Therefore, in as far as the inhabitants are concerned, an Englishman cannot be said to \" go abroad \" when he makes the short and delightful voyage between the Island and the mainland. When, however, he extends his excursion as far as the Channel Islands, \u2014 which every one who can find it conve nient ought to do, he will find himself quite in another country; not indeed in so far as the general government, and the original race of the people are concerned ; but in respect of their language, their common laws, and many of their customs. This is an additional inducement to visit the Channel Islands, over and above the healthiness of the voyage, and the richness, and in some respects, the physical novelty of the Islands themselves. The visitor will find c 2"], [26, "14 , INTRODUCTION. himself in a miniature Britain, consisting of three little king doms, of which he may, if it suits his fancy, consider Jersey as the England, Guernsey as the Ireland, Alderney as the Scotland, and Cerq and Herm as the \" odds and ends ;\" and the three principal parts agree in general position, only the miniature England and Scotland are, of the group, the most distant from each other. He will find also that, though there are not the same distinctions among the people as there are in the three component parts of the British empire, there are physical differences, as great between the little spots themselves, proximate as they are to each other, and similar as the climate must be in them all. Nor will he fail to ob serve, that, in comparison, there is a wildness of nature about Cerq, somewhat analogous, in comparison, to what occurs in the Scottish Isles, but very different in character. Such, in brief outline, are some of the inducements which every man, and more especially every Briton, has to visit the Channel Isles \u2014 including the Isle of Wight among the rest, as it is as much a Channel island as any of the others, although it lies much nearer to the mainland, and is an in tegrant part of the county of Hants. It were not only easy, but very delightful, to amplify those inducements, and expatiate upon them to any length, but such is not necessary, even though our limits would admit. The subjects them selves would bear any amplification ; for in so far as easy access, natural beauty, a high degree of fertility, and an atmosphere which is balm itself, are concerned, these Islands cannot be described up to the reality, or praised beyond their merits. There is this advantage in them too, and it is an advantage which applies to them all, that a very short time suffices for seeing the whole of any one of them, or even of the aggregate. Now this an advantage, which no one can by possibility enjoy in a tour throughout a large country, though its size should not exceed that of England, or even of Scotland. Say, that one took a month's jaunt in England, in Scotland, or even in the Scotch highlands alone, and if he were fond of studying countries, he would find,"], [27, "15 INTRODUCTION. on his return, that he had done little more than examine a sample, which, instead of being complete gratification, would only plague him with anxiety to see the stock. In the case of a short continental tour it is still more so ; for if the time is only a month, the most that the tourist can do on his return, is simply to say that he has been abroad, Less than a month will, however, with ordinary activity, suffice to make one thoroughly acquainted with all that is most worthy of being seen in these Islands ; and then there is the double enjoyment of seeing land and sea every day, not only without any great effort, but almost whether the traveller will or no. There is much more in this than the generality of men are apt to suppose ; for a satisfied mind leaves one fully at liberty, and in spirits, to see and admire ; and the constant change and variety of nature, is probably the best means, not only of restoring the body to health, and the mind to tone; but also the most wholesome stimulus to greater desire, power, and activity, than were formerly pos sessed. A full, and, in some respects, an experimental conviction of the truth of these positions, has induced us to write these remarks, with a view to induce every one who can, to give himself the pleasure of enjoying the sight of these little gems of the empire ; and if we should succeed in accomplishing this, we know that we should be the means of causing more real pleasure to be enjoyed, than if we had gained a battle, or founded a settlement in the Australian bush, or the Canadian wilderness. Speaking of bush and wilderness, we must be allowed to add that there are at home, and partly in the larger island under notice, spots of land with no smack of the wilderness about them, upon which all intending emigrants might, for the next half-century at least, find abundant occupation, most useful to themselves, and neither unprofitably nor dishonourably to their country. And, we may add, as not irrelevant to the case, that an Englishman who wanders abroad upon what is called a plea sure tour, before he has visited the Isle of Wight and the"], [28, "16 INTRODUCTION. Channel Islands, is not only unjust to the beauties of his own country, but deprives himself of a most useful element of comparison. In treating of subjects which lie so much apart from each other, and which differ in so many essential particulars, it will not be possible, at least it is not desirable, to follow any one general plan, by which observations on geology, meteorology, or anything else, can be made to bear equally on the whole. Therefore, we shall divide our work into two distinct parts, the one descriptive of the Isle of Wight, and the other of the Channel Islands. In both we shall en deavour to give hints of all that can be useful, either to the resident or the visitant ; but we shall carefully avoid those minuti\u00e6 which are only spoiled by being mentioned before they are seen. In doing this, we shall have to examine several departments of nature, to look back into the past, by means of historical facts, and of existing monuments, to survey the present, and to glance forward to the future ; and if we can succeed in this, to the gratification of those who open our volume, our desire will be satisfied, and our reward obtained."], [29, "XII ihn.mi /*/\u2022//, , U /"], [30, ""], [31, "17 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. PART I. THE ISLE OF WIGHT. CHAPTER I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION. Charming to the stranger, delightful to the visitor, and healthful and happy to the resident, as must be the Isle of Wight, it is a sad perplexity to the describer. All its fea tures are peculiarly its own, so that no similitude can be brought forward capable of setting it in a clear light to such as have not seen it. All of these features are beautiful, and some of them have an expression beyond simple beauty; but this expression is of a shadowy and ethereal nature, and cannot be told. In many situations, its towering cliffs and thundering seas have some of the elements of the sublime, but still they are not sublimity itself. To obtain the true sublime of the raging main and the resisting cliff, there must be a firmness and stability in the latter, \u2014 it must stand up girded with strength, as one of the ancient pillars of the earth, against which the utmost fury of the tempest beats in vain. Pillared Staffa, the black desolation of Cape Rath, or the rifted skerries of Ultima Thule, are sublime ; for they have in them that eternal element which yields not, save to the bidding of its Maker. But even in its boldest cliff, the Isle of Wight is a soft and yielding thing, and one cannot"], [32, "18 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. contemplate it without the frailty of beauty mingling with the idea. Its chalky cliffs are ever and anon hurtling down in masses ; and, where the green sand and the upper oolites present an alternation of stone and clay and marl, whole fields or farms give way in land-slips, and display beauty certainly, but it is the beauty of ruin. It is this singularly mixed character, intermediate be tween the beautiful and the sublime, which renders the description of the Isle of Wight so difficult, and has caused it to be a failure in the hands of every one who, feeling it aright, has attempted to describe what he felt. Those who are familiar with landscapes, and wish to carry the beauties of nature home with them in their portfolios, know well that they dare not paint those scenes which delight them the most. There is an indescribable something about them, which, though it tells directly and forcibly upon the enlightened and feeling mind, cannot be limned in earthly colours. It were as easy, faithfully to represent in a picture, the inde scribable tints of the evening sun upon the cliffs of Alum bay, when that bay is just magnified, but not quite veiled by the fog of the earliest autumn, when thousands of nascent rainbows sport in the intermediate air, and turn the innumerable natural hues of those varied cliffs, into a sports ing of gentle light, which no man can even name, as to render the features of the Isle of Wight faithful in any verbal description. To be felt and understood, this Island must be seen ; and herein consists the grand charm to the public, though it is the fatal stumbling-block of the de scriber. In the visit, there is a renovation both of body and of mind, analogous to which there can come nothing from the perusal of any book ; and there the visit is so easy, and so little expensive, both in time and in money, that those who neglect it, go down to their graves all wotless of one of the most delightful pleasures which this world can afford. This difficulty, or rather this impossibility, which one feels in attempting to describe the Isle of Wight in general terms, is probably the cause of the feeble bombast with"], [33, "19 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. which it has been burdened by those who have written con- cerning it, \" And set its beauty forth \u2014 till all men doubt it, And wrote, \u2014 about its Goddess, and about it,\" without giving their readers even the slightest taste of its real quality. For this reason we shall not attempt any general delineation of the Island, but merely advert to a few circumstances which may, in a plain way, assist in guiding the stranger to its beauties, which we are sure he will enjoy far more in his own original meditations, than in any com mentary of ours \u2014 or of any body's else. As the Island is obviously a fragment of some more exten- sive land, existent either under the waters of the ocean, or above their level, \u2014 is a country complete in itself, and not quite analogous even to those parts of the mainland of Hamp- shire which are nearest to it ; it has its own topography as well as geology. Though small, it is what may be called an entire country; having its own mountains, or rather hills, its own plains and valleys, and its own streams ; and although the ordinary action of the sea and the atmosphere is wasting it on the south and south-west, and some more violent catastrophe has in former times affected it there, yet neither that action, nor this catastrophe, appears to have had much reference to the rest of England. It is true that, toward the southern parts of the chalk districts of the main- land of Hampshire, the chalk strata, as indicated by the layers of flint, dip slightly toward the north, as if some power from below had upheaved them a little toward the southern part ; but this departure from the horizontal position is slight and uniform as compared with the upheaving of the chalk and other strata, in the western part of the Isle of Wight, and even that of the green sand and the oolite toward the south. This position of the strata, to which we perhaps shall have occasion to advert more at length hereafter, gives evidence that the Isle of Wight is to some extent a formation by itself, depending upon causes different from those which have upheaved and modelled the adjacent parts of the main- D"], [34, "20 ISLE OF WIGHT. land, although there is considerable similarity in the com position of both. As accords with the character of a small detached country, not formed by any volcano, or other violent outburst from the the earth, the inequalities of surface iu the Isle of Wight are in perfect proportion to its magnitude ; and thus, though it is only a little island in supplement io the mainland part of an English county, it is the miniature of a continent \u2014 a land to be described on its own natural data, without reference to any other. The principal length of the Island lies east and west, from the Needles at the western extremity, to the Foreland at the eastern ; and the line joining these, though stated in some of the books to be about thirty miles, is very little more than twenty-two miles and a half. The cross measure, from the extreme south near Knowles, to the extreme north at Egypt near West Cowes, is about thirteen miles and a quarter ; and as these lines cross each other nearly at right-angles, and the lines joining their proximate extremities fall some times within and sometimes without the line of the shores, the irregular trapezium, formed by joining the four extre mities, is a tolerable, though rude, approximation to the sur face of the Island. In round numbers, a trapezium twenty one miles and a half in its transverse or longest diameter, and thirteen miles and a quarter in its conjugate or shortest, gives, at the standard rate of sixty-four acres to a square mile, a surface of about 95,000 acres ; and the usual area assigned for the land, which probably exceeds the truth a little, as the sum of a number of individual measures in a country is always greater than the general measure of that country, when determined by astronomical observation, is 105,000 acres. Perhaps the truth may be somewhere about 100,000 acres. The shape of the Island, is very nearly that of a flounder, with the head to the east, and the tail to the west ; and the likeness is still farther made out by Brading bay, which lies through the eastern part, in the same oblique direction as a"], [35, "21 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. flounders mouth. The sides may be designated : the south west, which is about thirteen miles and a half in the straight line, from the Needles to the most seaward rocks at Knowle ; the south-east from Knowle to the Foreland, which is about half-a-mile shorter on the straight line, but of at least equal length along that of the shore ; the north-east, Avhich is twelve miles from the Foreland to Egypt, though conside rably longer in the coast line, in consequence of Brading bay and sundry creeks ; and the north-west, from Egypt back to the Needles, which is about thirteen miles on the straight line, but also considerably longer on the line of the coast. Generally speaking, the whole northern coast of the Island, including the north-east and the north-west sides, is the more sheltered and quiet of the two, inasmuch as it is not exposed to any but land winds, nor to any very heavy swell of the sea. It is on this coast that the only creeks and safe harbours, or even anchorages, are to be found, \u2014 the other side being exposed to all the violence of the tides and storms, without any landing, saving a few coves for boats, and even there, small craft cannot be left in the water except during the mildest weather ; while, when the wind and the sea are up, the whole line of the coast is unapproachable without the certainty of destruction. In order to form some notion of the diversities of surface in this peculiar Island, it will be necessary, in the first place, to advert to the position of the principal heights, which di vide it into valleys, or slopes toward the sea ; and this will be best done by beginning at the Needles to the westward, and tracing the several lines of downs in their course eastward. The western termination of the Island is a sharp and pre cipitous point, which is continued within flood-mark by the Needle rocks and the bank which has been formed by the gradual destruction of these, and the deposite of pebbles and gravel around the bases of such as are left standing, and among the ruins of those which are now under water. On the sides of this point, there are two bays ; Alum bay, al ready alluded to, on the north, having a chord of about a d 2"], [36, "22 ISLE OF WIGHT. mile, from the extreme promontory of the land to Hather wood point, and an in-bend of rather more than a quarter of a mile from this chord to the bottom of the bay, at the point where the tertiary and fresh-water formations overlay the chalk, and where the colours of both descriptions of cliff are so fine, when seen in a favourable light. The chalk being here the more compact substance, opposes the greater re sistance ; and the Needle rocks, standing in advance of the chalky point, divide both the winds and the waters, and turn them against the other shores of the lateral bays. It should seem that the sandy formation immediately adjoining the chalk, is upon the whole softer than it is northward, toward Hatherwood point ; and besides, there is a passage eastward for the wind here, between High down, which commences at the Needles and stretches eastward, and Henden hill, a little to the north, which in part consists of strata of compact sand, approaching . to free-stone, and thus offers conside rable resistance. Between these elevations there is a little stream, though a very little one, falling into Alum bay, near the hotel which has been built for the convenience of such visitors as prefer this part of the Island ; and the descent by the gorge through which the stream flows, is rather pic turesque, and carries one down to a sandy beach which is very clean, and the water on it very clear in calm weather, and when the tide is out. It is a little to the northward of this that the pure white sand, free from every metallic taint, and, therefore, fit for the manufacture ofthe best description of flint glass, is obtained, and exported in considerable quantity for the glass manufacture. In some parts of this rock there are also found strata of aluminous shale, so strongly im pregnated with sulphuric acid as to yield common alum by the usual process ; in other places there is sulphate of iron, so abundant in some of the strata, as to be extractable for the copperas, or sulphate of iron, of commerce. It is from the aluminous strata that this in-bend of the coast has received the name of Alum bay. From the point at the Needles, the lofty chalk ridge ex-"], [37, "TK1E MEEE.LES, ISLE OF WIGHT h (LO m PAY, islf. or me, Wuuhesim, ' ' \"' Strut"], [38, ""], [39, "23 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. tends nearly in a straight line, a little to the northward of east, for about three miles and a quarter, to Freshwater, where it certainly sinks down almost to the level of the sea, This chalk ridge is nowhere above a quarter of a mile, or at most three furlongs, in breadth ; and the summit of it, which continues nearly at the same elevation throughout the whole length, is in some places upwards of 600 feet above the level of the sea. The southern side of it, along the wThole line is one continuation of bold chalky cliffs, in which the action of the waves and the weather has worn various indentations and caves, some of the latter of which are picturesque, if the term can be applied to anything com posed of chalk rocks. Some of the caverns consist of large perforations, formed in various directions through the chalk, by the wearing away of the softer parts, while those that are more undulated have been left. We shall probably have to notice some of these when we come to the particulars of the topography. Of the indentations, the most remarkable is Scratchall's bay, immediately to the south of the extreme point, not much above a quarter of a mile in the chord, but deeper in proportion than Alum bay. This little bay ter minates at Sun corner toward the south-east ; and in advance of this corner there are some detached portions of the chalk remaining, but they are trifling compared to the Needles. From Sun corner to Freshwater bay, at the eastern termina tion of High down, the cliffs form a rugged wall, from which portions are occasionally detached and fall into the water, but it is upon the whole, more durable than the character of the formation would lead one to suppose. One reason of this is the position of the line, which, trending a little to the north, is out of the direct set of the wind and tide ; and when one comes to the eastern termination of Freshwater, there is an in-bend, in the bight of which a gravelly beach has been accumulated, and is still accumulating. This beach forms the principal summit-level in this part of the Island ; for the western Yar which flows northward to Yarmouth, a distance of rather more than two miles and a half in a straight line,"], [40, "24 ISLE OF WIGHT. rises immediately northward of the beach, and thus almost entirely insulates the western part of the Island. In this western part there is no chalk ridge, save the one which has been noticed, and which has the Needles light-house very near Scratchall's bay, and a beacon about a mile and a half farther to the east ; but, unless for guiding vessels into the Solent, between the Island and the New Forest, these warn ings are of comparative little value to the mariner, because, notwithstanding their elevation, they are apt to be enve loped in fog at the very times when the sight of them would be most desirable. This is the case with all the beacons which have been erected upon the high downs in the southern parts ofthe Island ; aud therefore, the best maxim, for a sailor who has to proceed up or down the Chaonel, is to keep clear ofthe Island altogether. \u2014 We must, however, follow the di rection of the chalk downs eastward, in order to furnish some idea of the slopes of the surface. From Freshwater eastward, the downs continue in a sin gle straight ridge for about three miles, when they are again interrupted by a pass of considerable steepness, but not cleft down nearly to the level of the sea. The cross-road, from Brook on the south of the Island, to Shalfleet in the north, passes through this gorge, and immediately north of it rises the most considerable of the small streams which join the Solent below Shalfleet. A few small streams also rise to the southward which unite near the parish church of Brook, and enter the sea by the gorge of Brook chine ; but as the summit-level here is not above a mile and a quarter from the sea on the south, these brooks are of trifling magnitude. This is the case with all the brooks on the south side, or back, as it is called, of the Island ; but the havoc which they commit on the soft strata of clay and marl is great in proportion to their usual quantity of water; and even where the softer strata alternate with beds of rock, hard enough for ordinary building stone, these rocks promote, rather than hinder, the havoc made by the streams. In rainy weather \u2014 for the rain often falls heavily here, these"], [41, "25 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. brooks swell to formidable torrents, in consequence of the rapidity with which the rain descends the bold escarpments of the chalk downs ; and this is one of the reasons why the gorges, locally called chines, by which those brooks descend into the sea, are worn to such ample dimensions as they present in many places. The narrow downs, now alluded to as extending eastward of Freshwater, aie those of Afton and Tapnell. upon the fomier of which there are several bar- rows that probably mark the spots where the inhabitants of the Island contended with the invaders that had effected a landing at Freshwater. Theie are also a few similar bar- rows on Shalcomb down, immediately west of the pass which terminates this division of the chalk ridge, and it should seem that they also were connected with defending the pass which leads from Brook to the interior of the Island. Beyond this pass, Mottestone down extends about a mile and a half, a little to the southward of east, and at about the same distance from the coast of the Channel. At this part there are secondary elevations both to the north and the south; so that the ground partakes partly of the character of dowus for about three-quarters of a mile in breadth. At the eastern extremity of Mottestone down there is another gorge or pass, through which the road from Mot- testone and Brixton on tbe south, to Calbourn on the north, finds a passage, Beyond this the downs increase in breadth to nearly two miles in their full extent, and occupy the greater part of the way between Brixton and Calbourn. Brixton down and Lemerstone down are the principal eleva- tions in this part of the ridge; and they extend about a mile and a half eastward of south, from the pass last described, to the pass at Shorwell, which is the most easterly among the chalk hills in this part of the Island ; and through this pass there is one of the principal thoroughfares between Newport, the capital of the Island, and the southern parts. From Brix- ton down, toward the easterly part ofthe section of the ridge just noticed, the chalk heights trend to the north-east, in which direction they continue for nearly four miles, and ter-"], [42, "26 ISLE OF WIGHT. minate opposite Carisbrook, a little more than a mile to the southwest of Newport. This section consists principally of the downs of Roughborough, Galleberry, and Bowcomb ; the former uniting with Lemerstone and Brixton downs, and forming an irregular plateau of small dimensions. Along the summits of all the downs now described there is a very delightful promenade, as every height commands a view of the whole country north and south of the Channel on the latter hand, and of the Solent sea and Hampshire on the former. In many places there are drives along the downs, practicable for equestrians, or even for carriages ; but those who wish to understand the Island well, will find themselves nearer their purpose by travelling on foot ; and, if the weather is fine and the sky clear, it is difficult to imagine a more delightful walk. The whole length of it, from Yarmouth to the Needles, and from the Needles to Shorwell, is not above fifteen miles ; and the hotel at Fresh water gate is a very pleasant \" rest and be thankful.\" At the same time, though the downs are of sufficient elevation to command a distinct prospect of all the places between them and the shores, they are yet not so lofty as to give much of a bird's-eyTe appearance to the scene. The view to the southward is across a narrow extent of very rich lowland country, containing the villages of Brook, Mottestone, and Brixton, together with a considerable number of detached farm-houses ; but the character of the shore is not seen, and there is rather a deficiency of timber \u2014 the exposure to the strong sea-winds from the south-west being unfavourable to its growth. There is no town, no large mansion, nor any place of great importance in this part of the Island, but the land is in general very productive. The view northward is far more beautiful, in consequence of the different blendings of land and water, which shift their characters as one proceeds along from down to down ; and, in consequence of the passes to which we have alluded, as breaking the chalk ridge right across, one has a new view at every summit, or rather the same subjects so changed"], [43, "27 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. with reference to the position of the axis of vision, has given them a novel appearance. The coasting vessels too, which these narrow seas are seldom without on a fine day, give a liveliness to the prospect ; and this is farther increased by the estuaries of the streams at Yarmouth and Shalfleet, which, at high-water, expand into numerous ramifications, and pre sent something of the appearance of inland lakes. Altoge ther, the prospect of this part of the Island, as seen from the ridge, is very fine : it is strictly rural, containing rich fields and meadows in some parts, and, though ornamented, not crowded or encumbered, with timber. From the pass at Shorwell, the valley of the Carisbrook stream extends north-eastward, for about five miles, to the town of Newport ; but the stream itself is of very inconsidera- ble length, except in the rainy season. The road from Shor- well to Newport lies nearly along the bottom of this valley ; and as the ground rises into considerable heights on both sides, the view is confined to what is within the valley it- self. If, however, one keeps the heights to the extremity of the down opposite Carisbrook, the north-western part of the Island, the Solent, and the New Forest, remain visible the whole way. To the eastward of Shorwell, the downs again acquire considerable elevation, and form a sort of plateau between the valley of Carisbrook and that of the river Medina. These heights consist of Ramsdown, and the downs of Chillerton, Gatcomb, and Gansons, their prin- cipal height extending from south to north, and terminating northerly in the elevated knoll or hummock of chalk, upon the summit of which stand the remains of the ancient and once venerable castle of Carisbrook ; the principal remain of antiquity in the Island, though, as it now appears, most of the parts of it are comparatively of modern date. The heights just mentioned are nowhere of any great elevation, neither do they command very extensive views, except east- ward, along the valley of the eastern Yar, \u2014 one of the prin- cipal streams of the Island, and northward to the estuary of the Medina. Along the whole south side of the ridge, except E"], [44, "28 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. where the chalk forms the sea-cliffs, that formation crops out upon the green sand, or some of those beds of which the strata called by this name are made up ; and, upon the north side, the chalk is everywhere overlaid by the tertiary formations, which are made up of all descriptions, marine, estuaral, and lacustrine, as is indicated by the fossil remains which are met with occasionally in almost all places, and abundantly in some. To the eastward of the river Medina there rises a continuation of the chalk down, which ex tends eastward from Newport, inclining a little toward the south, for about nine miles, until it terminates in Culver cliff, a bold headland in the eastern part of the Island, but inferior in elevation and grandeur to the western headland at the Needles. This portion of the chalk downs begins at the westward with two branches, one of which rises immediately eastward of Newport, and stretches eastward by itself; and the other begins on the opposite side of the Medina to Carisbrook castle, and joins the former at Arre ton down, about two miles south-east of Newport. The remainder of the ridge eastward, along Mepley, Ashey, and Brading downs, is an unbroken straight line, and presents a bleak and naked appearance. A road from Brading to Newport passes nearly along the summit of this part of the down and commands fine views, both to the south and the north. Southward there are the plains and valleys of the Yar and the Medina, with the lofty downs in the south ern part of the Island, in which these rivers and their branches rise. The northern escarpments of these downs are, generally speaking, bold; and though the summits are rather bleak, the slopes are more varied in their outlines, as well as more favourable to the growth of timber than the chalk downs, and therefore they make a pleasing termi nation to the view in this direction, which also commands the sea to the south-eastward ; but not over the summits of the downs. Along this ridge, the north coast is about four miles, on the average, from the summit ; and as the soil here is, generally speaking, a rich part of the tertiary formation,"], [45, "29 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. and well wooded, it has a very pleasant appearance ; while the road of Spithead, and the Sussex downs, are visible beyond. As is the case with the chalk ridge in the west ern part of the Island, it here crops out upon the green sand along the south, and passes under the tertiary formation on the north. The eastern extremity of it sinks down to a com paratively low level immediately to the south of Brading, where there is a pass of some half-a-mile in breadth, through which the river Yar winds its way to the head of Brading harbour. Eastward of this pass, the down again makes its appearance in a continuation of its former line, and, under the name of Bembridge down, stretches eastward to Culver cliff, upon which the winds and the waves are making in roads, though not perhaps with the same success as in the western part of the Island. Still, the cliffs here are well worthy of a visit ; but the description of them properly be longs to that of the shores, inasmuch as there is no natural cliff worth visiting formed by an inland chalk ridge. What we have described is the grand central or chalk for mation of the Isle of Wight ; and taking the whole of its extent, we shall not perhaps be very wide of the truth if we say that two-fifths of the Island lie to the south of it, and three-fifths to the north. In the southern parts, however, there are considerable heights, formed by matters under the chalk, and some of which are the greatest heights in the Island. Those heights want much of the regularity of the chalk hills, being composed of masses, ranging northward and southward, with considerable vallies between their northern branches, which vallies are, in general, fertile and well cultivated. The length of this southern ridge of the Island, from Knowle near Chale on the west, to Shanklin on the east, may be about five miles ; but the breadth is very irregular, as the downs advance to the interior in some places, and the north-running streams have their sources within very short distances of the Channel in other places. In passing along the summits of these downs, little or no thing is visible toward the south, except the tops of the E 2"], [46, "30 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. secondary heights and the Channel with its shipping be yond. But, toward the north, the view from the more ele vated of them is much more interesting. Of the downs in the southern part of the Island, com posed of the strata under the chalk, there are three principal divisions: Saint Catherine's in the western part, which is about 750 feet above the level of the sea, and the summit not a mile distant ; Week down in the middle ; and Boni face and Shanklin downs on the east. The middle one is of somewhat inferior elevation, but the summit of the eastern down is almost as high as that of the western. Between St. Catherine's and Week down there is a considerable valley, sloping almost from the brow of the cliffs, and con taining the first streams of the Yar, together with the vil lages and parish churches of Whitwell, Niton, and St. Law rence ; though the last is eastward, and rather under the cliff. The opening between Week down and Boniface down is more closed in on the south towards the sea ; but the posi tion of the downs forms a very beautiful shell or amphitheatre of rich land, in which Appuldurcombe house, the seat of the present earl of Yarborough, and the finest in the whole Island, is situated. The top of St. Catherine's, in this ridge of downs, may be said to command almost the whole surface of the Island, with the exception of the shores under the cliffs, and also an entire horizon of the surrounding sea and land ; and the views from Shanklin down is also very exten sive, the only interruption to the whole horizon being that of St. Catherine. As these downs are sheltered from the violent sea-winds on their inland slopes, and as they are generally of clay or marl, they are favourable to the growth of timber, and they may be cultivated almost to their very summits. On their seaward sides they are more bleak, being severely scourged by the tempests ; but still they are more fertile than one would be led to suppose of lands at such an elevation. The southern margin of these downs for about seven miles, from Black-Gang chine on the west, to Chine head on the east, presents a singular appearance, as a certain"], [47, "31 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. portion of the land has been disrupted from the rest by the action of the wreather, and has sunk down towards the shore, and formed a country of ruins, exceedingly rugged in its surface, but very fertile in many spots, and altogether beautiful. This singular margin of country, is not, however, seen from even the most elevated parts of the downs ; and therefore, the description of it belongs to that of the shores, not of the breadth of the Island, as seen from any point within it. What we have already attempted to trace, marks the principal summit-levels, with the exception of a small portion extending from Chillerton down, above a mile east ward of Shorwell, to St. Catherine's. There are some heights in this part of the Island; but they consist chiefly of sand, and hence they are tame and flat, as compared with those which we have already noticed. They are also na turally less fertile, and indeed, less susceptible of culture, and many parts are naked or furzy moors, of no very plea sant appearance. These heights extend along the western or left bank of the upper part of the Medina, which has its source near Stroud green, about a mile and a half from the south coast of the Island at Chale bay. If these summit-levels are carefully traced on the map, the examiner will be prepared to trace also the minor details of the surface. It will be seen that, throughout the whole length of the Island, the principal summit-level is much nearer the south than the north ; and that in the downs from St. Catherine's eastward, it lies within less than a mile of the sea. This gives scope for greater length to the streams than they could have had if the summit-level had been in the centre of the Island ; and the fact of the greater portion of the land sloping northward, protects it better from the action of the elements than if it had sloped the other way. Still, if we except the sandy soil in the western part of the Island, toward Alum bay, and the heights of the chalk and sandy ridges, no part of the Island can be said to be natu rally unfertile ; while in some places the soil is very rich ; and, even in the exposed situations, the Island is much more"], [48, "32 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. favourable to the growth of timber, than its direct exposure to the winds of the Channel would lead one to suppose. It is true, that few places of it have a tendency to run into natural coppice, except the humid dales in the sheltered parts of the cliffs ; but there is a considerable quantity of planted timber, especially in the north-east part ofthe Island, towards Spithead; and in former times there was a royal forest, though not a very extensive one, to the north-west of Newport. From the principal heights or summit-levels which wre have endeavoured to trace, the several streams which water the Island, descend toward the sea, chiefly in a northerly direction, the only exception to this being in the tract of country .from Freshwater eastward along the downs by Shor well, to Chillerton down, and then souttnvard by Kingston to Chale bay. This is, in an agricultural point of view, one of the richest districts of the Island ; consisting chiefly of strong clay and marl, until the land becomes thin and light upon the upper slopes of the downs, where it passes into grazing land, or elevated sheep-walk, the surface of which is in some places exceedingly steep. Taken altogether, to the very ex tremity under St. Catherine's, it is about ten miles in length ; but its greatest breadth \u2014 that at the eastern part, where a portion of it lies on the dry green sand, is not above three miles, and it narrows to a point at Freshwater. In its geo graphical position this is a country apart ; detached from all the rest of the Island by heights, and with only a few passes \u2014 those already alluded to, through the chalk ridge that forms it northern barrier. From its small breadth, there can be no river of any considerable magnitude ; but there are several brooks, which rise in the hills, immediately under the chalk, and pursue their short courses southward to the sea. These brooks are, however, too insignificant for forming any thing like conspicuous features ; and therefore, the whole of this part of the Island, when seen from the heights, has the appearance of one continuous narrow plain, consisting almost entirely of corn-fields, and but thinly spotted with human"], [49, "33 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. habitations, or with trees. The principal streams are those which flow by Brook, by Brixton, and from near Kingston ; but in the dry weather they are quite insignificant, and we believe they are nameless even in their own localities, though they suffice for turning mills, and for other country purposes. Although the district has ten miles of sea-coast, this coast is, excepting when the weather is very fine, still more com pletely a barrier than the chalk downs to the northward. It is everywhere steep, and in most places fenced in by numbers of rocks, some of which advance a considerable way into the sea. They are not however ledges, as one meets with in a country, the sub-stratum of which consists of stone, but frag ments, indicating a vast operation of ruin by the common surface action of the elements. The whole of the line of coast is in the progress of decay ; and though this decay is gradual, there is not a year which does not diminish the sur face to some extent. Against this there is no remedy. Though considerably lower than the downs, the district pre sents to the sea a cliff or wall of some elevation, and com posed for the most part of materials which are soft, and also retentive of humidity, so that, after continued rains, they ac quire a plastic consistency ; and in the case of frost, they are decomposed by the expansion of the water they contain. The rain too, falls in torrents, especially upon the slopes of the chalk downs; and it is thence precipitated ' upon the plain, and floods the brooks to the extent of small rivers, which would pour themselves over the cliff in cascades, if that cliff were formed of substantial materials. Its substance is, however, of a nature but ill calculated for resisting the rush of the flowing water, and the consequence is, that not only the perennial brooks, in which there is some water at all seasons, but the occasional ones, which flow only after rain, have formed for themselves those peculiar ravines de scending to the beach, which are locally termed chines. The etymology of this word is, like that of many others of local usage, but imperfectly known ; but it appears to be nearly synonomous with the common words \" gap,\" and \" cleft,\""], [50, "34 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. the origin of it being supposed to be an Anglo-Saxon verb signifying to cleave asunder, or to open. There is thus something more descriptive in this local term, than there is in many terms of more general currency ; for it has an active meaning, and implies not only that there is a gape or cleft in the earth, but that this gape or cleft is becoming more and more extensive in the progress of years ; and what is here implied is true of all the chines in the soft strata of the southern parts ofthe Island ; the only district, we believe, in which the word is used. This is not, however, the only part of the British shores, in which similar ravines or chasms, formed by brooks which occasionally swell into torrents, are to be met with ; for, wherever the strata are soft, and an es carpment of considerable boldness is presented naked to the sea, or even to an alluvial plain immediately under the clayey or gravelly surface, there is a deep gully cut into it, resem bling the chines of this part of Hampshire. Of this there are some remarkable instances along the upper part of the Moray frith, both on the Inverness and Ross-shire sides. Indeed they are common in every part of the country, where the water from a ridge descends upon a plain of soft mate rials, having its terminal edge abrupt ; and if this edge abuts upon the sea, we have exactly the same sort of chines as appear in this part of the Isle of Wight, though this is the only part of Britain in which they have a proper name, ex pressive both of their appearance and their progress. Along the entire southern coast of the Isle of Wight, from where the chalk ceases to form the cliffs, and which is between one and two miles to the eastward of Freshwater bay, though the country is so narrow that there is no cur rent of sufficient power to form a chine, till we advance to nearly three miles from Freshwater, there is a succession of these ravines for about 17 miles along the line of the coast; but with an interruption of about six miles from Rocken end to Chine head, along the extreme south coast of the Island, where the land has slipped, and formed an under-cliff the whole way. Over this under-cliff the water"], [51, ""], [52, ".3 HAM iii J n Ci-J _ N E. y.sXA' fl_F WIGHT \u25a0i,....,, ita . fui-h ji,,-.! for ii,. pi, 71. -.,.,-.

The principal chines are situated along the south-west coast, from Brook chine, three miles along the beach from Freshwater, to Black gang chine, immediately under St. Catherine's ; and again, on the south-east of the Island, from Chine head, at the ter mination of the under-cliff, to Shanklin chine ; a little to the northward of which, lowlands and a sandy beach continue to the chalky promontory of Culver cliff. The first of these is in extent between seven and eight miles, and the second only about a mile and a half. Beginning at the western end, we have Brook chine, a dell containing bushes, and de scending gradually from near the village. A mile and three quarters farther to the south-east, we have Chilton chine, formed by a very small brook. Three-quarters of a mile farther we have Grange chine, formed by the larger stream, which passes the village of Brixton at nearly a mile from the shore. This stream consists of two principal branches ; one from the north-west, rising near the pass between Mottestone and Calbourne, and the other from the east, near Shorwell. The first of these is not above a mile in length, and the se cond is very little more than two miles ; but both are peren nial ; and, with the assistance of artificial ponds, serve for the supply of mills, for ornamental water, and for domestic, pur poses. As is the case with all brooks and streams having their origin upon the margins of the chalk country, whether their subsequent course be across formations naturally over or under the chalk, these brooks receive the greatest portion of the supply of water near the foot of the hills \u25a0 and, as this water is collected in the fissures, it issues from the earth, cool and transparent ; and, as spring-water it is subject to very little variation, either in volume or in temperature, F"], [54, "36 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. during the whole course of the year, although a great addi tion of surface-water is made to it in the time of floods. About a mile to the eastward, or rather the south-east ward, of Grange chine, there is Barnes chine, where there is no permanent stream, the chine being merely a notch formed by the surface-water. A little to the westward of this chine, there are numerous rocks, known by the name of the Ship ledge ; and indeed, there are rocks all along the shore, from the commencement of this district of flat land, about a mile and a quarter east of Freshwater bay, to the point last men tioned ; and these rocks render the line of the coast quite unapproachable, except in quite calm weather, and by small boats that are well acquainted with it. From Barnes chine eastward, there is a slight in-bend of the shore, forming Brixton bay, which has a beach of shingle and sand under the cliff, without any apparent rocks ; but it terminates in the ridge of Atterfield rocks, about two miles south-east of the Ship ledge. This bay is also exceedingly hazardous for shipping ; and if, by violence of weather, or unskilful management, a vessel upward-bound should come too near the Island and escape from this, it is only escaping Scylla to be caught upon Charybdis ; for, immediately by the eastward of Atherfield rocks, there is Chale bay, the most fatal portion of the whole shore. Into Brixton bay, the brook, which rises nearly to the eastern summit-level at Kingston, falls into \"the Channel by Cowleaze chine. This is the most peculiar of all the chines in the district ; the brook, in its deep ravine, running north-westward, parallel to the shore, for nearly a quarter of a mile, before it finds its exit through the cliff. As the summit-level comes nearly straight south from Kingston to the middle of the bight of Chale bay, the streams which fall into that bay, are short and insignificant, even as compared with the miniature rivers in the more westerly portion of this singular district. Accordingly, the chines Avhich occur in Chale bay, until one arrives at the grand height of St Catherine's, appear merely as notches in the"], [55, "\u25a0 E OF WIGHT Winchester Tubliihed for- tfcc Pre-sirittor Jaf Jfabfcne College -fasst. * . OF. Crilmour Public Ltbrari/ Sigh Street"], [56, ""], [57, "37 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. cliff during dry weather, though each pours down, explana tory of its cause, when the rain falls heavy upon the heights. Of these small chines there are two, Whale chine, about a mile to the eastward of the Atherfield rocks, and Walpen chine, a little to the eastward of that ; and at the last of these chines, the peculiar district and shore which we have been attempting to describe, may be said to terminate ; as a very little way to the eastward, land-slips, and other devas tations committed by the weather without aid from the sea, give quite a new character to the stripe of country along the shore, and a character which well merits separate descrip tion, as being different from almost anything else on the British coasts. The shore of the land, which we have now noticed, is wasting away certainly, but its grand destroyer is the sea, aided only by the brooks and torrents which form the chines, and the land-springs, which work the marley and clayey strata into mortar, and thus render them more easily solu ble by the waves and winds. It will be easily understood that, as this portion of the coast presents itself almost di rectly across the south-west wind \u2014 which is the prevailing, and by far the most powerful one, as the shore immediately margining the water is bold, and, as the downs are a short distance inland, and rise abruptly to a considerable elevation, the action of the wind, especially upon the naked face of soft strata presented by the shore, must be exceedingly severe. As is the case with every species of action, the effects pro duced by the wind are violent in proportion to the resistance which is made to its motion. It is so well known as to be proverbial, that the wind which rends the most sturdy oaks, and lays the tallest pines level with the ground, hurts nei ther the osier nor the reed ; and, for the same reason, a wind which sweeps harmlessly over a naked and level plain, will commit great havoc upon a vertical surface opposed to it. The difference in the case of wind is much greater than in that of water, or indeed in that of anything else, with the motion of which in volume we are acquainted. This arises f 2"], [58, "38 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. from the elasticity of the air, in consequence of which it is condensed when it impinges against a cliff or other eleva tion ; and, as condensed air has always a tendency to expand and resume the volume according with its general tempera ture, this re-action of the air, from its physical nature, gives new power to it in assailing those cliffs against which it beats. Hence, high windward coasts, and the windward sides of ridges and single mountains, are always more scourged and beaten by the weather, than those which stand in an oblique direction, and especially than those which stand to leeward. This is exemplified along the whole western shores of the British Islands, and those of Europe generally, with the exception of such as are changed by local causes \u2014 as for example, the bight of the bay of Biscay, and the coasts opposite to Britain. In Cornwall, in Wales, along the west of Ireland and Scotland, the Northern Isles, and Norway to the extremity of Lapland, the coasts are not only scourged inward to the rock, but that rock has been torn away in the inverse ratio of its tenacity ; so that, from a good and accurate outline of the shore, one may always tell, knowing the general system of rocks in the country, what are the consistencies of those at different places. In Portu gal and Spain the case is the same ; and thus we may be prepared to find a miniature of it in the Isle of Wight. We have been thus minute with this particular part of the Island, in our general or introductory description, be cause it is a portion which, though peculiarly fertile and beautiful, is perhaps less visited by strangers than any other. This in part arises from the fact of its containing few or none of what are termed sights \u2014 that is, places and objects calculated to gratify the senses without drawing too largely on the understanding. These are the attractions which always have drawn, and always will continue to draw the multitude ; and perhaps, for this reason, they may be more lightly passed, by such as aim at supplying information which every one cannot readily and at once find for himself. Another cause of the comparative neglect of this portion,"], [59, "39 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. which in productiveness is really the garden of the Island, is the fact that no main road or thoroughfare is made, or can be made, along the shore, at any expense which the travel ling along it would at all repay or justify. The chines are cut so deep, and penetrate so far inland, that no road could be led along the top of the cliffs ; and although expense cer tainly might throw bridges over these chines, yet the soil is of so crumbling a nature, that in a few years, the said bridges would only add to the mass of ruin along the shore. Therefore, to human art, this is a tabooed coast, which no exertion of man can defend or protect against either storm or flood. It is true, that the very crumbling nature of the strata, which gives the elements such destructive power over it, enables the cultivator to turn it to great profit ; and, as the waste along this line is never wholesale, or by many acres at a time, as has occurred in the under-cliff farther to the east, the slow but sure encroachments upon its breadth, are comparatively unheeded, even by those who are habitually resident within it. Along the whole line too, there is little shelter for boats, and no under-cliff upon which villages for the accommodation of summer visitors can be erected; and therefore, this portion of the Island is left alone to nature and its native inhabitants much more than any other ; and, thus perhaps, the observer of nature and of man will find more instruction and pleasure, by traversing this field, than by visiting those other situations and scenes that are so renowned in vulgar story. We shall afterwards advert more particularly to its topography ; and endeavour to show, from the comparatively greater number of its churches, and the barrows upon its bordering downs, that this has been an esteemed part of the Island, from very early times ; but, before we proceed to this, it will be proper to glance round, and notice in outline, the leading features ofthe other parts, especially as they are marked out by the water-courses, and the elevations branching from the more lofty ridges by which these are separated from each other. From the Needles to Freshwater, and indeed as far as the"], [60, "40 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. western termination of the district we have noticed, the en tire slope of the Island may be said to be toward the north, or at all events, there is only so mere a margin ofthe south ward slope, that there is hardly a stream of water over the surface of it, even during the heaviest and most protracted rains. Not that there is by any means a paucity of rain upon those lofty chalk downs. Downs of this description become colder, during the night, than surfaces of other for mations, which, at the same height, are less warm during the day. There are two causes for this : the chalk is a much less absorbent of heat than more granular and dark coloured soils are ; and the form of the ridge reflects the heat in different directions, according to the position in which the sunbeams fall upon it. Thus, after the sun is set, the downs, and also the air over them, cool much faster than if they were differently composed and formed, \u2014 the surface itself cools, and there is but little heat to be given out by radiation. Hence, when the current from the south west, which is a warm current, and necessarily loaded with moisture, arrives at the downs during the night, there is al ways a tendency to the condensation of whatever vapour is contained in the air ; and consequently, to the formation of dew, of a fog, or of a rain-cloud, according to the general state of the weather. The Isle of Wight is too small in ex tent, and too near the mainland of England for being the general regulator of its owTn weather ; but if it stood alone in the middle of the ocean, and were without the range of trade winds, or other general currents, there would be rain upon these chalky downs every night in the year. As it is, we believe they are rarely, if ever, without dew ; and fogs are more prevalent than the transparency of the air, when the sun is up, and the day is fine, would lead one to suppose. This proneness to dew and fog, \u2014 though the latter is often perilous to the mariner, by hiding from him those beacons which would otherwise warn him against danger, \u2014 is highly beneficial to the downs themselves, and also to the plains below. The former are watered by it ; and though the grass"], [61, "41 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. upon all such downs is short, yet even these are never burnt up. And when the downs cool in the night, there is a land-breeze, alternating with the sea-breeze, which fails not to blow, in calm weather, as soon as the sun has dried and heated the downs. There is more advantage in this than many would suppose ; for, were the sea-breeze to be constant, those saline particles which are so unfavourable to vegetation, would settle upon every leaf, at least as far as the top of the ridge, and greatly impair both its growth and its quality. It is toward the Needles of course, that we have the most powerful day and night action of the atmosphere upon the downs, or rather of the downs upon the atmosphere, and it gradually diminishes as the said downs get more into the centre of the Island ; but their greatest distance from the sea is so trifling, that they must still continue to have some influence ; and to them the Island is in no small degree in debted for its delightfully salubrious climate. In passing, we may remark, that this advantage of the play of sea and land, tells most beneficially immediately upon the shores, and always more so in proportion as the high downs ap proach nearer to the water-line. This is some advantage, as a matter of guidance, to those who seek the shores of the Isle of Wight, or any of the analogous shores of England, for sanative purposes. Taking the Island generally, the south coast, from the Needles to the Foreland, independently of its being more seaward and sequestered, is more healthy than the north coast between the same points ; and, of the south coast, decidedly the most eligible portion is the under cliff, or the line of margin from Chale to Shanklin. When we advance into the centre of the Island, the mois ture which the downs attract from the atmosphere, perculates through the fissures of the chalk, and comes out in streams near the margins of the other strata, whether their position happens to be above or below that of this formation. Where, however, the downs themselves form the sea-cliff, as in the south-west part of the Island, the moisture which settles on"], [62, "42 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. them performs a very different office, \u2014 it settles in the fis sures, and gradually opens them, when near the face of the cliff, by means of its hydrostatical pressure, even without any assistance of frost. When a fissure is in this way open beyond a certain extent, as the opening does not extend much farther down than where the resisting pressure of the sea begins to be exerted, a sediment is deposited in the bot tom, and the fissure becomes water-tight. Whenever this is the case, it becomes an engine for the certain, though it may be the very protracted, overthrow of that part of the cliff between it and the sea. It works to the weather, pressing with great weight when full of water, and withdraw ing that pressure when the water is absorbed or evaporated ; and thus the volume of cliff, even though of great weight, is rocked upon its base by a silent and secret, but great and irresistible, power. It is easy to understand the vast power which the small est cleft, sufficient for destroying capillary attraction, can exert, by the simple means of ordinary rain, if it penetrates to the requisite depth. We shall suppose a fissure in the cliffs near the Needles \u2014 and the natural strata of the chalk are almost vertical there \u2014 to penetrate to the depth of 200 feet from the surface ; and then let us estimate what pres sure, water, filling this cleft to the surface, will exert upon the rock, for every foot in length of the cleft. Every one who knows anything of the pressure of liquids, must be aware that, surface attraction apart \u2014 and that can be exerted only in an exceedingly narrow fissure, \u2014 it matters not what may be the breadth of the quantity of liquid which presses against a given surface, for the pressure is in the ratio of the height ; and for any given height, it is the weight of an equilateral triangular prism of the liquid, whose side is equal to the height, and whose length is any portion of that of the surface pressed against. Consequently, in the case of water, we have only to find the solidity of this prism for a single foot in length ; and this, estimated at 1000 ounces to a cubic foot, will give us the weight which presses upon"], [63, "43 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. every foot in length of the surface in question. In our case of 200 feet depth of cleft or fissure, if the calculation is made, it will be found that, in round numbers, the pressure is equal to 480 tons upon every foot in length. 200 feet in length is but a trifle for the fissures which occur in such rocks ; but yet, in round numbers, it is not much less than 100,000 tons; and this after all is but a little fraction of the energy of that gentle natural power, which is every day cleaving the rocks at the Needles. The cliffs, from the point at the Needles to Freshwater bay, and those again at Culver in the eastern part, are the only ones in the Isle of Wight at which this power of de molition can act directly with force ; and at Culver cliff there has not been the same upheaving of the strata as at the Needles ; and therefore, whatever fall of the cliffs may take place there, is comparatively trifling. Still, it is desi rable fully to understand the principle and the power of its working, inasmuch as ignorance of those energies of nature, which work silently until they arrive at their final catas trophes, is very apt to produce the same absurdities in phy sical nature as superstition does in religion. The workings of the Almighty are perfect throughout ; and the powers and laws, which He has seen meet to ordain and institute for their operation and government, are quite, competent to the production of every phenomenon, which we can observe in the progress of its occurrence, or trace in the memorials it has left. No doubt there are workings within the solid mass of the earth, the origin and the progress of which are hidden from mortal view ; but, from the analogy of what we do see, we can without difficulty infer, at least in so far, the nature of that whereof the primary workings are hidden from us ; and by this means we are enabled, in what region soever of the world we fake the locality of our study, to turn, not only the surface appearances and productions of the earth, but the solid strata, as far as miner can dig, or the earthquake rend, into the elements of delightful, as well as useful, information. G"], [64, "44 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Reflections of this kind cannot be out of place when treating of the Isle of Wight, which is one of Nature's chosen spots, and therefore always the more 'fresh and full in the enjoy ment, the less that the impertinence of art breaks in upon it. It may seem that these remarks would have been more appropriate when we come to treat of the shores and cliffs of the Island as viewed from the sea, the arena from which they are most advantageously seen, when the placidity of the weather admits of a sufficiently near approach ; but, as the disruption of those cliffs, is not, like the working of the lower parts of them, an operation having its beginnings in the action of the sea, the explanation, in strict propriety, belongs to the notice of the surface of the cliffs, and we trust that what has been said \u2014 which we believe is new in a work of this nature, will neither be regarded as ill-timed, nor felt as unsatisfactory. We have preferred noticing the influence of surface-water in a fissure near the cliff at that place of the Island where, from the nature and position of the strata, it works most alone, and unassisted or undis turbed by other causes; and this being understood as a general principle, will enable us to address ourselves more peculiarly to the local circumstances, varying in the nature and extent of their operation with the character of the lo cality, which have operated in decomposing or disrupting the soil and strata of the Island in other places. Having pre mised this, we shall proceed to notice the variations of those portions which have their general inclination toward the north or the east, and which occupy by much the greater part of the surface. If we except the irregular valleys, which lie between the broken ridges of the chalk hills to the south-west of New port, the whole northern part of the Island, westward of the Medina, has its general slope toward the Solent. It is not, however, a continuous slope the whole way ; for, along the north-west and near the shore of the Solent, the tertiary for mation forms swelling eminences, though of no great elevation; and, between these and the chalk ridge, there extends a sort"], [65, "45 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. of central level, from near Yarmouth on the west, to near Newport in the centre, of the Island ; and, although this may not be the most beautiful portion of this natural divi sion, or the most desirable in which to build a residence, it is certainly the most, fertile. The elevations of the tertiary strata are chiefly found west of the Yarmouth river, near Alum bay, west of the Shalfleet river, or Newton river, and again westward of the Medina, where they rise to a conside rable height in Parkhurst forest, \u2014 which has however been disafforested and enclosed. The principal river of this natural division, and, as already mentioned, of the whole Island, is the Medina, which forms its eastern boundary far beyond the chalk hills on the south- east. Its source is in the green-sand strata, about a mile north-west of the escarpment of St. Catherine's, and not a mile and a half from the sea at Chale bay. The summit- level here has no great elevation ; and thus there is but little fall in the river in its course northward to Newport, where it meets the tide, and becomes navigable for boats and barges. Its source is near Strand green, in the parish of Chale ; but it is there of course a mere brook. For two miles its course is towards the north-east, to Cridmore, where it approaches to within rather less than a mile of the Yar, a little to the west of Godshill ; thence, its course is nearly northward, though with some flexures, both to the left and the right. About four miles from its source, it reaches, and in part passes through, Gatcomb Park ; and half-a-mile farther on it passes under the western shoulder of the eastern chalk downs. From its source to this place there are water mea- dows on its banks, but these are nowhere of any considerable breadth ; and, as the river and its tributary brooks, generally speaking, have their sources in the sandy soil, the water meadows are neither so productive in the quantity, nor so fine in the quality, of their produce, as those on the banks of rivers having their sources in the margin of the chalk. From Blackwater bridge to Shide bridge, where the river flows for about a mile, through the pass between St. George's down g 2"], [66, "46 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. on the east, and the heights of Carisbrook castle on the west, there are no meadows of any extent on the banks ; as the heights, although but of trifling elevation, descend by their sloping banks almost to the water-course. This is the most rapid part of the Medina, though even here it is comparatively a slow-running stream. About a mile below the chalk downs the Medina passes on the east side of the town of Newport, and meets the tide-way to the north-east of the same, where the quays, for export and import by the estuary of the river, are situated. The length of the estuary, from Newport to the harbour of West Cowes, is about four miles and a half, and half-a-mile more brings one into the clear offing in the sea. At low-water, the mud-banks on both sides reduce the estuary to a mere stream ; but at high-water, the breadth, in most places, may be about a quarter of a mile ; and the water is comparatively tranquil in all states of the weather. Fifteen feet is the average rise at spring-tide, in the narrow seas between the Isle of Wight and the mainland; and, as there is no particular current setting into the mouth of the Medina, the tide there does not exceed the average. There is also little sea air from so small a surface. The estuary of the Medina, all the way from Cowes to Newport, is a single channel, with no lateral branch and very few flexures ; and thus, were it not for the gently sloping banks with their alternations of wood and glade, it would be anything but beautiful ; but this gives interest and variety to it; and when seen from some points, it has the appearance of an inland lake, or of a succession of lakes opening into each other. The air from it, has also no dele terious effect upon vegetation ; and thus, although the trees and shrubs have that moderate growth which is characteristic of the whole Island, they are healthy and beautiful, so that a ride or drive along either bank, or a sail along the channel, is very agreeable ; but, to a lover of scenery, the land trip is the more preferable, and it is best when proceeding upwards from Cowes to Newport. The brooks which fall into the Medina are so small as"], [67, "47 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. scarcely to deserve notice, and they are mostly nameless, the principal one is that which flows along the north-west and north of Newport, and joins the Medina stream near the quay. This consists of Carisbrook, and another little branch from the west, the source of which is in the north side of the heights that lie to the westward of Carisbrook. The other branches are so small that they are not worth naming ; and they make no appearance in the landscape, unless when dammed up by artificial means. The next river, to the westward ofthe Medina, is the New- town or Shalfleet river ; and though the course of none of its branches is nearly so long as the main stream of the Medina, they perhaps, when united together discharge an equal quantity of water. This river, or rather this accumulation of brooks, drains the waters of a circular valley about four miles in diameter, the extreme eastern branches rising in the west side of Parkhurst forest, and Bowcomb down, and the western ones in a less defined height, which passes from Shalcomb down to Hampstead ledge, at the western entrance into the main estuary of the other river. Of these branches there are five or six, all the estuaries of which are tidal, that is, overflown to some extent at high-water; and they ramify from the main estuary like the branches of some spreading tree, which, following them upwards, become as it were twigs in the rivulets, and sprays in the rills. The central one, which is the longest of the whole, has its source near the pass in the chalk heights between Shalcomb down and Mot- testone down, and it runs northward, for about three miles, to the village of Shalfleet, a little below which it meets the tideway of the estuary. It is an insignificant stream, flowing slowly through grounds nearly level ; but still it suffices for turning mills, and for other country purposes ; and the fields on its banks are pleasant and fertile. There is only one western branch of any consequence, and this rises at Ning wood farm, about a mile and a quarter south-west of Shalfleet, and meets a western branch of the estuary after a course of about a mile. On the east of the principal branch, the first"], [68, "48 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. branch has its source in the north part of the broad downs, a short distance north-east of the village and parish church of Calbourn ; and, after a course of two miles, it meets the estuary to the south of Newtown. The last branch on the east consists of three brooks, \u2014 a middle one arising under Apes down, a mile and three-quarters directly west of Caris brook castle, and proceeding northward for about two miles, where it meets a branch from the south-west, which last branch has its source in the grounds of Swainston. A mile further down, these united streams fall into the estuary, where they are joined by another trifling brook, which rises under the heights of Parkhurst. Taken altogether, these streams are all only miniature rivers ; but they form a very perfect miniature ; and, at high-water, when the banks and the estuaries are completely covered, these have a very beautiful appearance, especially as seen from Mottestone down, the view from the centre of which is almost directly down the central stream and the estuary, to the entrance to the Southampton Water. In respect of the blending of land and water, and of the contrast of clumps of trees, rich fields, and a moderate sprinkling of villages, this is perhaps one of the most pleasing prospects which the downs of the Island afford. To the westward of Newtown river, there is only one other which flows towards the Solent coast of the Island, and this is the west Yar, or Yarmouth river. We have already mentioned that the principal source of this river is within a very short distance of the sea, at the low pass in the chalk hills called Freshwater gate, which lies at the bottom of the little bay of the same name. Thence, northward, to the parish church and village of Freshwater is not above a mile ; and though there is a bridge at Freshwater, the tide flows to some distance above the bridge. From Freshwater to Yarmouth the windings of the estuary measure rather more than a mile and half; and a few yards without Yarmouth, brings one into the clear tideway of the Solent. At low water of spring-tides, this estuary to Yarmouth is merely a narrow stream ; but at high-water it is as wide as is the"], [69, "49 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. estuary of the Medina in the same state ; and, as it almost insulates the portion of the Island to the westward, it has a striking appearance as seen from the downs to the west or the east of Freshwater gate, but especially the former. To ward one's left, the view on these downs is improved by the valley which extends from the base of the downs to Fresh water, and the sand hills beyond it on the west and north. To the west these hills rise to a considerable height, are dry and naked, and swarm with rabbits ; but to the north, though the soil is still poor and thin, they are in great part cultivated and divided into small patches, by hedges and hedge rows, a species of division by no means uncommon in the Island. On the western side of the Yar there is no stream worth naming, the sand-hills being even more absorbent of moisture than the chalk dowus ; but there are two branches to the eastward. One of these rises below the middle part of Afton down, and pursues its course, for about two miles, to the Yar ; while the other rises about a mile farther to the eastward, and flows, by the villages of Wellow, Thurley-street, and Thurley, into the common estuary, a little to the southward of Yarmouth. When the tide is out, the channel of the Yar just opposite the town of Yarmouth \u2014 which town lies on the eastern or right-hand bank, is divided into two by a bank ; and the ridges of some of the banks, directly opposite to the town, are always dry; but, at high-water of spring-tides, this estuary makes a much more respectable appearance than it does at ebb. Such are the rivers of the northern coast of the Island, in cluding the Medina and those to the westward of it. Besides these indeed there are a few independent brooks, the chief of which is one that flows from the north-east part of Park hurst forest, and enters Gurnet bay, about a mile and a half to the west of Cowes. But this, and indeed all the others, are so small as never to form striking features of the country, and in dry weather they are not visible features at all. The principal heights lie between the three rivers which we have named, and on the westward of the Yar, generally speaking,"], [70, "50 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. nearer to the sea than to the chalk hills ; but as their heights are trifling, their slopes are tame; and, though there are rocks along many parts of the shore, there are no bold cliffs of soft materials and broken by chines, as is the case in the south side of the Island. Beauty cannot with justice be denied to this portion of the Island, but it has no very strongly-marked characters ; and the beauties which it does possess, are of that quiet rural character which one is apt to pass over without much notice. Still, some of the villages and detached houses are pleasingly situated ; and all of them are in excellent keeping with the scenes of which they form part. Between Cowes and Yarmouth, there is no village of any consequence along this part of the shore, neither is it, generally speaking, very favourable for landing, although the sea seldom beats against it with much violence. The remaining portion of the Isle of Wight, in respect of the general characters of its surface, may be divided into two sections. The one of these consists of the country northward of the summit of those downs which stretch eastward from near Newport to Culver cliff \u2014 excepting the interruption near Brading, through which the eastern Yar finds its way to Bra ding harbour. By this passage, of a small part of the lower coast of this river, through a district which is cut off from its proper valley, except by the gorge or pass between the downs, the two districts are here blended with each other ; but, as this is the case only for a little way, and as the chalk rises again into a definite ridge in Bembridge down, at not more than a mile from Brading down on the opposite side, the general direction of the downs from Newport to Culver cliff, a distance of about nine miles along the water-shed, this may be taken as the most convenient natural boundary for the purpose of reference. The western part of the downs, from Arreton toward the Medina, consists indeed of two ridges, which enclose a kind of valley, inclining north-west toward Newport, containing the course of a small branch of the Medina, and therefore properly belonging to the general valley of that river ; and thus this valley must be excluded,"], [71, "51 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. both from the north-eastern slope of the Island, and from the valley of the Yar, which occupies the eastern part of the Island, between these central downs and the more elevated downs above the under-cliff in the south. From East Cowes to the Foreland, the greatest length of this slope of the Island may be about 11 miles, and the breadth does not throughout the whole extent, exceed be tween 3 and 4 miles, both distances being of course taken in a straight line. It is to be understood, however, that the boundaries now traced are natural ones, such as can be seen by any one who examines the Island itself; whereas the paro chial and other divisions, which have been made by man, have little reference to natural circumstances, and therefore are arbitrary in themselves, and both invisible and uninterest ing to such as visit the Island only for the purpose of observing its natural features. Generally speaking, this slope is watered by short streams which pursue their courses directly toward the Spithead arm of the narrow seas ; and they are so small, that, in a more extensive country, they would be little heeded even by the most minute topographer. Geographically, and even topographically, they have no names ; but they serve to mark the hollows which stretch from the chalk ridge to the north coast, and thus they serve for remembrances of the adjoining heights, and of all the other particulars of the surface. The highest portion of this slope, and the one most destitute of streams, is the portion immediately northward of the chalk ridge to the eastward of Newport ; but though there is a dry height in this part of the natural division, usually called the heath, and which may have once, to a considerable ex tent, deserved that characert, yet there is little or none of it which is an absolute waste at the present time, though the whole is far from being productive. This district forms the ridge, or highest level, from the chalk downs northward to behind East Cowes ; and to the eastward of it, there is the first of the small brooks already alluded to. The hollow along which the brook flows is well wooded, and it enters the ii"], [72, "52 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. sea at King's quay, about 3 miles to the eastward of Cowes, reckoning along the line of the coast. The next brook to the eastward is considerably larger. It rises immediately under the chalk ridge of Messly down, about 4 miles east of Newport, and pursues a tolerably straight course north ward, becoming tidal at nearly 2 miles from its source ; and then flowing along a narrow estuary, for about the same dis tance more, until it passes through the pond bank which has been constructed here, and reaches the low-water line, under the name of Wooton bridge creek. The entrance to it, at high-water, is about a quarter of a mile wide, and it narrows gradually as it advances into the interior, forming a very or namental piece of water. The ground on the banks here is in many places rich, and throughout the whole course of the stream the banks are well wooded. The pious fathers of old did not overlook the fineness of this situation ; for the site of Quar abbey \u2014 afterwards to be noticed, was at a very short distance from the mouth of this little river ; and, as a matter of course, upon one of the finest spots in this part of the Island. The entrance of this creek is about two miles and a quarter westward of the Pier at Ryde. From the valley of this little river eastward, the country toward Brading harbour, is not so regularly formed, but consists of an irregular bank, descending toward all sides, except that portion of the south which abuts upon the downs. There is one little stream in it, which enters the sea at Binstead, about a mile to the west of Ryde ; and another, which rises in the chalk downs, about a mile and a half to the west of Brading, flows along a sort of valley, and enters the sea a little to the eastward of Ryde. Eastward of this there are.no streams worth mentioning; but the land sub sides gradually to the level of the sea, and though tame in appearance, it is rather beautiful. When the tide is in, Brading harbour, the entrance to which is between two points that overlap each other, is a fine sheet of water, and highly ornamental to the surrounding country. At low water, it consists entirely of sludge, with the exception of a"], [73, "53 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. narrow channel for the Yar, which winds along its length, and into which there are several runs or creeks formed in the sludge. At such times, it is of course a little unsightly, or at all events, not so fine a feature in the landscape, as when it presents one uniform surface at high-water; but even the banks here, when the tide quits them, are not quite so unsightly as they are upon some others of our muddy shores ; for the sea-weed upon them gives them some of the appearance, but assuredly none of the odour, of ver dant meadows. The small peninsula on the south side of Brading harbour, which is cut off from the remaining part of the south-east coast by Bembridge down, is not above two miles in length, from the downs north-eastward to the Fore land, and it is about a mile in the cross direction. As seen from Brading down, on the opposite bank of the river, which is the best point of view, this peninsula appears to slope gradually from the summit of the downs to Bembridge point, which forms the southern boundary of the entrance; and on the landward side of which there is shelter for small craft, which craft, with the adjoining village, give some life to the scene. The north side of the extreme entrance is Watch-house point, three-quarters of a mile north of the former, and about the same distance direct east of the church of St. Helen's ; and, from this point, a reef of rocks extends across the bank a considerable way into the sea. The ex treme north-east of the Island, which is Nettlestone point, and where there are the remains of an old fort, is about a mile and a quarter to the northward, nearly south-west of the entrance to Langston harbour, and exactly six miles from Cumberland fort, which guards the entrance to that harbour on the west. From what has been said of this particular district, it will be seen that, though taken as a whole, it is rich and beau tiful ; and though the several parts of it are well diversified, yet, with the exception perhaps of Brading bay, it contains no single natural feature of any very great interest. It must not be understood, however, that this is any disad- h 2"], [74, "54 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. vantage to those who visit the Island for the purpose of examining its more striking scenery. On the contrary, it is a decided advantage; and were the Isle of Wight turned round, so that the Needles were opposite Portsmouth, and the under-cliff against the east part of the New Forest, assuredly it would lose many of its admirers ; and compara tively few of those who landed to view the coast, would be tempted to make the tour of the Island. But this approach of simple beauty draws one on, first to the bleak elevation of the eastern downs, and then across the southern valley or plain, to the lofty cliff, and the wildly-rifted shores. Perhaps it is an additional advantage, that the two principal ports at which a visitor enters the Island are upon this part of the shore, and lead him over this tract of simple and sober beauty ; for this is \" the Isle of Wight ;\" and as some travel ling over its surface must be practised before anything un usual in the way of scenery can be seen, the surprise pro duced by the peculiar scenery, when seen, is of course considerably greater. We may mention, in the mean time \u2014 the places themselves we shall describe afterwards, that Cowes and Ryde are the two grand portals by which to enter the Isle of Wight, as Southampton and Portsmouth are the grand points of departure from the mainland of Hants, and each is the terminus of a great high road from the British metropolis. Cowes is the natural harbour at which to land from Southampton ; and the road from Cowes southward, leads directly through Newport the capital, on ward to the southern extremity, at wThich the tourist may turn either to the right-hand or the left, as he lists. New port may of course be reached from Ryde also, and the distance overland is only between two and three miles longer than that from Cowes ; and, as the road from Ryde is more tame than that from Newport, perhaps it is upon the whole, the better route. We shall have occasion to mention these matters more at length afterwards, but we deem this slight allusion necessary, inasmuch as the landing-places, and the passage from them, are involved in the natural de scription of this particular district."], [75, "55 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. We shall now briefly notice the remaining valley or plain, which lies between the chalk ridsre, in the centre, and the high downs of the formations lower than the chalk, in the south of the Island. This natural division, although some- what irregular in its southern boundary, from the projection of the downs northwards at some places, and their recession southward, and subsidence at other places, has yet more unity of character about it than any which we have named, ex- cepting the small district to the southward of the western downs, and its character is more decided than even that. The whole of it may be described as the valley of the eastern Yar, which, though it would be an inconsiderable brook in a large country, is certainly the giant of the Isle of Wight rivers, whether with regard to its course, or the estuary of Brading harbour, into which its waters are discharged. If we take the whole course of the Medina, estuary and all, it is not very many miles shorter than the Yar; but then the Yar is at least twelve miles long as a river, while the Medina has only half that length. Not only this, for the surface which the Yar drains is more than four times the extent of that drained by the Medina, and the character of the soil is at least as favorable to the formation of streams of water. The greater part of the valley or plain of the Yar consists of the green-sand formation, or of clay, sand, and marl, alternating with each other in various proportions; and the same kind of strata overlay the upper oolites on the northern slopes of the downs, though these appear under the green-sand beds on the opposite or seaward side. In the upper part, that is the extreme west ofthe valley, there is much sand; but on the north-west and north, the green-sand is overlaid by the southern margin of the ehalk, which, being the under chalk, contains fewer flints, and is a less pure carbonate of lime than the chalk of the mainland ridges. It is not, however, on this account, less adapted for those purposes to which chalk is usually applied in rural economy, \u2014 as a manure for the fields, or as mortar for building. The longest half of this valley is that which lies on the"], [76, "56 THE ISLE OE WIGHT. west and north of the river, but it is nowhere very conside rable in breadth \u2014 not a mile upon the average ; and as it is for its greater length near the chalk, the main trunk of the river receives very few branches from this side, and the few rills that it does receive are not worth naming. The op posite or south-eastern side of the river, though the downs in the extreme south-east, towards Chine head and Dunnose, occupy a considerable portion of it, contains much more cul tivated ground than the other side, and also abounds more in streams, though none of the latter are of any considerable magnitude. As was hinted at already, the extreme source of the Yar is near Niton, about a mile north of the sea, and less than half-a-mile from the commencement of the under-cliff near Beauchamp, directly north of Puckaster cove \u2014 a small bight in the seaward portion of the rocks in which boats can find shelter in most winds, as the projecting rocks at Knowle, in the extreme south ofthe Island, protect it from the violence of the Channel winds ; and as the shore begins to trend to the northward of east, there is a slight eddy, or at all events a slackening of the current, in all the small inbends, or coves, upon the coast of the under-cliff. We shall however describe them more minutely hereafter, when we come to treat of the under-cliff, as one among the peculiar features of the Island ; and therefore, in the mean time, we shall confine our observa tions to the more general subject of the Yar and its valley. From its source, near the village of Niton, this little stream winds northward, and even here, the bed of it is not much above the level of the sea, the upper valley being very dif ferently formed between downs on the right and the left. A considerable number of springs swell out, and rills descend from the slopes of those high downs, so that there are some mills upon the stream at no great distance from its source ; and it receives one considerable brook from the western downs, and another from the eastern. This upper part of the valley ofthe Yar is a remote portion ofthe Isle of Wight ; but yet it is one which is easily reached from Newport, as the principal road from that town to the under-cliff passes"], [77, "57 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. directly along the centre of it. On the left or west bank of the river, though the very high downs terminate sooner, secondary downs of lower elevation proceed all the way from them to the central chalk downs, forming the summit-level north and south in this part of the Island, and also the natural western boundary of the district under notice. While the high downs continue, the scenery is, from the diversity of the surface, and also the quality of the soil, very beautiful ; but it by no means improves in appearance as one descends the valley. The river pursues its course, in nearly a north erly direction, but with various flexures, for the first five miles, passing about half-a-mile to the west of the beautiful village of Godshill, along by the east side of which there flows a small stream from the downs, which has some water-meadows on its banks just below the village, as there are also on the banks of the main stream opposite to this, and, at intervals, through all its course to Brading harbour. The next branch of the river rises in Rowdown, not very far from the sea, at the modern village of Ventnor, and it flows through rather a wide and irregular valley, with Boniface and Shanklin downs on the east, and the heights, hanging woods, and beau tiful park of Appuldurcombe on the west, beyond which it passes into the plain; and, after a course of about three miles, bends westward and joins the main stream near the small village of Badbridge. Below this, the branches are still more trifling, inasmuch as the heights, over which Shanklin down rears its steep escarpment to the north, advance for some way into the plain. At their termination, however, there is another little stream, which winds northward for two or three miles, and joins the Yar about the same distance from its confluence with Brading harbour. In the lower part of its course there are broad meadows upon both sides of the river ; but, as the soil, which the stream brings down when swollen, is light and sandy, as the district is open to the east winds, and as some portions of the flats are subject to flooding and heavy rains, the vegetation, in the central part of the valley, is not so kindly as one would expect from the latitude and the"], [78, "58 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. character ofthe westward soil on the same parallel. Not a little of the lower valley here is composed of sand, and to ward the sea there is the long inbend of Sandown bay. This bay presents low sandy cliffs toward the northern and central parts, from where the chalk strata of Culver cliffs terminate, but as Shanklin is approached, the cliffs, though still chiefly composed of dark coloured clay and marl, are more lofty, and here they begin to be cut into chines, where ever there is a streamlet descending from the hills. The most northerly of these is Shanklin chine ; but, as it is one of the sights, we shall reserve our notice of it for another place, and hold the valley of the Yar as terminating on the sea-coast a little to the northward of Shanklin. There is a considerable breadth of tolerably good land in the valley of the Yar ; but, except at a few spots, the district is not very beautiful, and it is upon the whole rather deficient in timber, though there are pleasant groves and copses scattered about here and there. From the general description, brief as it is, it will be seen that the Isle of Wight justifies the epithet bestowed upon it, of being a miniature continent, having its characters as a whole; and having not the least appearance of a fragment disrupted, either by some convulsion, or by the more slow progress of the ordinary elements, from the mainland on the opposite shores of the narrow seas. It will be seen that it has its central ridge, or spine of hills, which forms a kind of plateau, though a very irregular one in respect of the eleva tion of its surface, to the southward of Newport, or in the very centre of the Island; while, both eastward and westward, those chalk heights narrow to a single ridge. Then there are elevations in the south and inferior ones in the north, \u2014 the former disrupted, where the principal rivers have their sources; and the northern heights, which scarcely can be called hills, except to the westward of Yarmouth, being also disrupted by the outlets of all the northward running rivers. By these means the lowlands of the Island are formed into a northern and a southern plain or valley, the latter two principal summit-"], [79, "59 GENERAL DESCRIPTION. levels are eastward, and the other westward of the river Medina, which is not above the high-water mark at Newport ; so that, though the chalk heights near that town, make a considerable appearance when viewed from it, they have but little elevation above the level of the sea. The north-eastern division, towards Portsmouth, is among the best wooded in the whole Island ; and perhaps it owes this character to its proximity to the naval station there. The north-western division, from the Medina westward, is the largest, perhaps the most varied in its surface, and certainly the most broken by small tidal estuaries. The south-western division \u2014 the small one south of the downs, to the character of which we devoted some attention, is perhaps taken as a whole the best wheat country ; but it is comparatively bare of timber ; and, from the violence with which the south-west storms beat upon it, it is not very well adapted to the growth of trees, though there are some in sheltered spots, and copses grow vigorously in the dales. The south-eastern natural division we have just described, and therefore we shall presume that the general characters of it are fresh in the memory of the reader. Those, however, who wish fully to understand, and easily to remember, the several localities of this, or of any other district which is interesting as a place of resort, cannot be rightly prepared for doing so by the reading of any descrip tions, however, accurate, lengthened, or elaborate; and indeed, in so far as descriptions have the last two of these characters, they set generalisation at defiance ; and, like a common work on topography, which goes minutely into description and disquisition upon every single scene and subject \u2014 every building, old stone, or remarkable tree, they make the reader well acquainted with the parts, but leave him in total ig norance of the whole. To prevent this, it becomes necessary to have a sort of tablet, which can be transferred as a whole to the memory, and with which all the details can be con nected ; as this not only enables one to bear them in mind, but also to place them in their proper situations, and trace their relations. For this purpose we know of but one ade- 1"], [80, "60 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. quate means, and that is an accurately delineated map, not so crowded as to be difficult to read, but yet with all the bolder features marked, and all the remarkable places named. Such a map will be found accompanying this volume ; and we need hardly add that, if this general chapter is read by any one with the map spread out before him, the advantage will be incalculably greater than if he depended upon reading alone ; and if the object is to treasure up for future usefulness that which is seen and enjoyed at the time, the map should also be in use. In order that all the routes or passages to the Island may be seen, we have directed the engraver to insert a correct outline and the leading particulars of all the narrow seas, as far as Southampton."], [81, "61 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. CHAPTER III. GEOLOGY AND SOIL. In a geological point of view, the Isle of Wight is fully as interesting as in any other, inasmuch as it contains a very full and perfect display of a considerable portion of those three formations which are characteristic of the south of England, namely, the several tertiary deposits above the chalk, the chalk formation itself, and a certain portion of the oolitic beds under it. Nowhere in Britain are such sections of the strata, or successions of strata, so fully displayed as on the western part of this Island, where it has been so much invaded by the sea, from the termination of the remaining chalk at the Needles, to Headon hill toward the Solent. That a disruption has taken place since even the most modern of these strata was deposited, is perfectly evident, from the po- sition of the strata which have been upheaved until some of them form very small angles with the perpendicular ; but stills as the chalk and the common tertiary formation over it have been much more disturbed and tilted up than the mixed for- mations over them \u2014 consisting of fresh-water, marine, other fresh-water, and alluvial formations, which lie above the sand, which in general is the cap of the tertiary series \u2014 there is some reason to believe that the two have been disturbed by successive upheavings from below, though whether these took i 2"], [82, "62 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. place at different submergings of the present land, or all hap pened before it was raised above the bed of the waters, there are no specific means of ascertaining. The strata under the chalk, of what nature and consistency soever they may be, do not make their appearance until the coast under Afton down, more than a mile to the eastward of Freshwater, is arrived at; neither is it known, with anything like certainty, how deep the under part of the lower chalk may be below the present low-water mark at the Needles ; but there is some reason to think that the depth on the southern margin is not very great, because the chalk crops out, and the strata under it make their appearance at so small a distance to the eastward. Before we can fully understand the geology of the Island, we must glance westward, to that which, as was stated in the second volume of this work, appears to be a portion of the chalk ridge which has, at some period, been continuous with that of the Island. This is the chalk which forms the long ridge, from Purbeck hill eastward, to Ballard down, between Studland bay on the north, and Swannage bay on the south, a short distance southward of Poole har bour. If we look at the direction of this portion of the ridge, we find that it may be traced very naturally toward the Needles, so as to form the southern margin of the great chalk basin of the middle of the south of England, which, like the great basin to the north, has the central part of its area, where not occupied by water, chiefly composed of the tertiary formation. This obvious continuation, in former times, of the chalk ridge, from the south of Dorset to the Isle of Wight, though it is now interrupted, establishes an obvious geological con nection between the one place and the other. It does not indeed appear that the disturbance from below has been quite so great in Dorset as in the\" Isle of Wight ; for lower strata make their appearance above the sea-line there, than any which are to be met with at the back of the Island; but still, there is a resemblance in their general"], [83, "63 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. composition sufficient to show that they belong to the same series, and probably to the same geologic era. In neither the one place nor the other has the granite or other ig neous rock, whatever it may have been, appeared above the surface ; for there is no part along the shores, or at any depth to which examination has been made, which is not of a stratified character, and the obvious result of a deposit formed in water, or by the action of water in some way or other. That we may better understand the geology of the Island, we shall advert very briefly to the three formations of which it is composed ; and though the chalk is the middle series, and not the upper or the under, we shall first direct our attention to that. We do this, chiefly because the chalk is the most simple of the three, and the most uniform in its composition and consistency, both in its thickness and in its extent. Wherever the chalk, or cretaceous formation, occurs in what we may call an entire state, that is, without having much of its upper surface washed away by the action of the water \u2014 and probably in some instances by the atmosphere upon it, it consists in general of soft chalk near the upper part, abounding with flints, usually in strata nearly' hori zontal, unless when their level has been disturbed after they were deposited. Below this there is a harder chalk, in which few or no flints appear ; under this the character of the mixed strata depends a good deal on the strata below. If these strata are clays or sands, of a blue or green colour, and strongly impregnated with iron, the lower chalk is usually of a reddish colour; but if chalk, marl, and green sand, intervene in considerable beds, the chalk is paler in colour. The difference in hardness between the chalk which abounds in flints, and that which contains few or none, appears to be owing to the presence of the flints them selves in the one, and not in the other. There is every rea son to believe that the flints have been originally sponges, or other soft zoophytes containing little or no calcareous matter, but a good deal of alkali, which latter has attracted"], [84, "64 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. the siliceous particles from the chalk formation, and con verted them into those siliceous pebbles, which we term flints. The presence of these in the upper strata of the chalk, their absence in the under, and their appearance in pretty regular layers, or strata, wherever they occur, throw some light upon the progress of those chalk formations, though of course, not upon the length of time requisite for the forming of them. Those which contain no flints have been obviously deposited in the depths of the ocean, farther down than there is any life ; and though a few fossils are found in those lower chalks, we must regard them as exuvi\u00e6, gathered into the grand charnel-house of the deep, and not as having lived in the situations in which we find them. Nor need we in anywise wonder that so vast an ac cumulation of shelly matter as the chalk presents to us, should be accumulated in the bed of the sea ; for, when we consider the multitudes of living species of shelled molusca, and their great reproductive powers, the annual exuvium in shells must amount to a very great quantity ; and whatever this quantity may be, we have only to multiply it by the requisite number of years, or of ages, to bring it up to any amount that imagination can suggest. Before this deep-sea and lifeless formation of chalky matter could become covered with those zoophytes which have turned into flints, we must suppose that some cause acting from below \u2014 and the mass of the earth is never idle any more than the surface and the atmosphere \u2014 had raised it to such an elevation as brought it within at least the con fines of the kingdom of life ; and that after being thus up heaved, it must have been left at peace without any new de posit of chalk until the animals performed their labours, after which a new action had entombed them in a fresh deposit, and so on while the series continued. But, though we can form some judgment of the succession in these formations*! we must be silent with regard to the time, which has proba bly been long even beyond the range of fancy. Such is the middle system of formation in the Isle of"], [85, "65 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. Wight, \u2014 the one which forms as it were the axis of the Island ; but the axis of elevation, by which the southern edge of the chalk has been tilted up, and the strata to the southward of it brought to the surface, must have been situated to the south of the whole Island as now existing. What this axis was \u2014 whether action simply, or matter, we have no means of ascertaining ; for it is gone, and has left no memorial excepting in its effects \u2014 which are however sufficient to show us how mighty it must have been in its operation. After this general notice of the chalk, which throughout its whole thickness, is entirely a marine formation, it will be most convenient next in order to consider the formation under the chalk. This is the oolitic series, much more variable in its component strata than the chalk, and by no means so uniform in different places. The chalk, wherever it is found, gives evidence that originally it has been depo- sited in the sea, without being at any time raised to the sur- face, and again submerged to get a fresh deposit. But, in the oolitic series, we find strata containing remains, evidently in the places that they occupied when growing, which could not, according to the general analogy of nature, have existed at all except in the atmosphere, and that too, in all probability, in an atmosphere of higher temperature than that of the places where they are now found. These pro- ductions, which have obviously been formed upon land, and also others which have been as obviously deposited in fresh- water, or accumulated by its action, have marine formations both above and below them ; and therefore, the places in which they are found, must have been at first under the waters of the ocean, again elevated into dry land, and yet again submerged, and have received, in many instances a succession of different deposits over them, often to a very great thickness. Amid all this elevating and depressing, however, and during the long period which it must have occupied, there has been no positive disruption of the strata here, nor has a single volcanic or earth-born rock made its"], [86, "66 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. appearance at the surface \u2014 at least within a long distance of this part of England. The bare statement of these facts, and they are recorded in the earth and cannot be gainsaid, puts an end to the old and erroneous notion, that all the changes which we per ceive in the materials of the earth are the result of a single general deluge, during which, \" all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened \"; \" and the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days \"; for though we were to allow each day of this figurative hundred and fifty to stand for a thou sand years, or a million, or a thousand millions of years, we should just be as far from an explanation of the phenomena of which we actually find the results in the earth, as though each were measured by one single rotation of the earth upon its axis. It must be plain, to any one who will think but for a moment, that, wherever we find productions of the land or of the fresh water, apparently in their native localities, the surface under which they are found must have been land ; and that, as often as we find a marine formation covering a stratum of this kind, there must have been a submerging under the ocean waters ; and, therefore if we are to suppose deluges to have produced these effects, we must suppose as many of them as there are alternations ; and, as many of the formations are very local, we must further suppose that various little districts have had each its own deluge. In the southern part of the Isle of Wight, where the strata under the chalk make their appearance, we have few remains which render it absolutely certain that there has been dry land there, at any period before the elevation of the present surface ; but still we must not infer from this that there never has been such a surface, although that sur face, in its memorials, may be deeper below the sea, under the high down of St. Catherine, than the height of that down above low-water mark : \u2014 and, the wealden clay does make its appearance under the gault and green-sand, on the beach near Brixton, on the south-west of the Island, and"], [87, "65 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. again in Sandown bay on the east. To convince ourselves of the probability, nay, the certainty, of this, we have only to glance westwards, to what we have said is probably a continuation of the same strata, in Dorset. The greatest ex- tent, southward of the chalk, which we find there, is in the Isle of Portland; and here, though individually the strata are a little different from those in the south part of the Isle of Wight, they obviously belong to the same series. In the Isle of Portland, immediately above the beds of Portland stone, which have been quarried to such an extent for build- ing, there is a thin stratum of black loamy or marly matter, containing, not merely fragments of very peculiar trees, but the roots of them standing in the same situations in which they appear to have grown. The large trees which are found in this formation are chiefly, if not exclusively, of the conife- rous orpine family. The roots, or stools, stand at moderate dis- tances, irregularly distributed, as we might suppose in a na- tural forest. Some of the trunks are more than thirty feet long and branched ; but the sprays and leaves are entirely gone, and no vestige of them can be traced in the stratum wherein the trunks are inbedded. The roots vary from a foot to three feet in height, and the greater number, though not all of them, stand upright. Thus, it appears that this subterranean forest had perished by that natural decay to which the forests of more modern times have fallen victims in other parts of Britain, and not by any violent catastrophe; and they appear to have lain bleaching upon what once had been fertile land, until it was depressed under the water and received a new deposit. Of course, the whole of those trees, with trunks and roots, are converted into siliceous matter, though that matter still shows the grain of the wood, and this is of the coniferous structure. So far as these trees are concerned, we may readily suppose them to have grown in a climate as cold as that of England is at present, or even colder ; because, at certain elevations above the level of the sea, conifer\u00e6 of one species or other, are found in every climate; but, along with them there are K"], [88, "66 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. others of which the appearance is a little more puzzling, in asmuch as all the living species of the orders to which they belong are natives of warm climates. These are similar to cycas and zameia, with simple branchless stems, but mark ed with the scales which have formed successive bases of leaves. These are arranged in spirals around the stem, some thing like the scales on the cone of a fir-tree, and there is a single tuft of leaves upon the top \u2014 the stem itself having something the shape of a bee-hive. These are short, and mostly found standing erect in the stratum alluded to ; but, like the other conifer\u00e6, probably pines, to which they are nearly allied in structure as well as in local association here, there is no trace of a leaf to be found ; and like the others, their stems are merely the stony monuments of the trees of a period long gone by. But, although those fossil remains are analogous to such as are now found in tropical countries only, we must not thence conclude, at least without further evidence, that the climate of this surface when above the water, had the same temperature as the tropical parts of the world have at present, any more than we must conclude, from the predominating of shells in a fossil state analogous to those found in the tropical or southern seas, that the character of the water in respect of temperature, \u2014 that is of the action of the sunbeams upon it, had been the same beyond the fiftieth degree of north latitude, as it is now at the equator. Neither animals nor plants are sent into the world to suit the temperatures of particular places, though many of them have wonderful powers of accommodating themselves to these; and the fact that the northern elephant, found in the ice berg on the Siberian coast, was adapted to the utmost ex. treme of a polar climate, affords us a proof that the familes, or even the genera, of plants or of animals, are no guides to the temperature at those times when they lived in what may be not inaptly termed a former world. In the situation al luded to, these fossil remains of a forest are covered by layers of silico-calcareous slate, the lowest of which adapt themselves to such remains of the mineralised trees, as have"], [89, ""], [90, "I"], [91, "67 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. not sunk into the earth, which had supported them while growing, and which is formed into a sort of dark-coloured marly loam of little tenacity. Over this entombed forest, there rest the beds of Purbeck stone, including various lime stones, sands, and clays, some of which appear to have been deposited in fresh-water, and others not ; and over these again, come the green-sand and the chalk, decidedly marine in their formation, until the whole thickness over the buried trees may probably amount to fifteen hundred or two thou sand feet in thickness. It is a portion of this upper formation between the buried forest and the chalk, which makes its appearance in the south of the New Forest ; and though the beds are not quite the same, they do not differ more than we find the present surface of the earth to differ at short distances ; and therefore they establish, rather than contradict, the hypothe sis, that the formations, though not of exactly the same ma terials in all their parts, have yet been brought about by the action of similar causes. In the Island, the green-sand part of the formation, or those beds which consist chiefly of siliceous matters, with a greater or smaller admixture of clay, and passing into marl, the whole much impregnated with iron, are far more abundant than in the analogous part of the same formation in Dorset, and this may be the reason why, with an equal, if not a greater disturbance of the strata, from the action of some subterraneous agent, whatever it may have been, the strata here do not come up to the same nominal depth of beds as they do in Dorset. We have been thus particular in noticing the strata under the chalk, in a region analogous to, and once, in all proba bility, continuous with, the south of the Isle of Wight, for the purpose of showing that one must not, from even con siderable differences in the individual beds, infer a different origin to strata obviously of the same position and the same geologic era, inasmuch as the action from below which up heaved those strata, whether deposited from fresh-waters, or those of the ocean, could not, by possibility, alter the com- k2"], [92, "68 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. position and arrangement, or the volumes of these strata, how much soever it might disturb their levels, and deflect them from the positions in which they had been originally left by the waters. The strata which are found in the cliffs on the back of the Island, are of sufficient consistency to form building stone. All belong to the upper oolite formation, and contain a great deal of calcareous matter, and numerous ammonites and other shells, with a considerable admixture of silica, and very little aluminous or clayey substance ; and therefore, when employed for economical purposes, they have little tendency to imbibe the water, and therefore do not decom pose with the same rapidity as strata into the composition of which that earth enters in much larger proportion. In them, the clay occurs separately, in the marly beds which lie intermediate between those of stone, and much thicker ; and it is the action of the water in these peculiar beds, which has occasioned the disruption of the harder strata, producing those land-slips which have given to the under-cliff on the back of the Island, a character so very peculiar, and one to which there is not anything exactly corresponding elsewhere within the British Islands. The comparatively thin beds of solid stone, which here alternate with beds of much softer materials, to a certain extent protract the de struction of the cliffs, but they at the same time increase the ruins when it does take place. If the whole cliff were yielding, as it is along the bay of Christchurch, and the under-down of part of the Island, from Compton bay totheHatherfield rocks, it would give way as these do, by gradual decompositions every year, greater or less according to the character of that year. When strata or plates of rock are interpolated be tween the clays and marls, these resist for a longer period, because the toughness of such rocks does not give way un til a considerable portion of the clay or marl under them has been softened to a kind of a jelly; and, when this portion is enough to overcome their cohesion, they break off at the breast of that part of the general stratification which is yet"], [93, "69 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. solid, and slide en masse upon the plastic matters below, re moving many acres of the surface at a single slip. When the action of the sea is such as to clear off the result of this disruption soon after it has taken place, the work of destruc tion goes on with little comparative interruption ; but when the land-slip descends upon a hard basis of rocky points, such as are formed by the angular edges of the oolitic strata, further down under notice, a certain portion of the sludgy matter below is pressed out, and discharged into the sea, and the remainder, having the strata of its own rock borne up by the points of those rocks upon which it descends, becomes the means of defence and protection from farther destruction. Upon this principle, the under-cliff ofthe back of the Island, as it at present exists, may be regarded as a means of protection to those cliffs inland which show their ragged and almost picturesque front to the traveller, as he passes along the under-cliff, not an instrument of farther demolition. Thus, from the peculiar nature of this part of the back of the Island, the under-cliff must be looked upon as a safe-guard to the land ; and while the soft beach to the westward, and the chalk cliffs beyond Freshwater, must gradually yield to the joint action of the weather and the sea, this portion of the shore will probably remain, for years or for ages, defend ed from the elements by the munition of its own ruins. Where the interior cliff, that is the portion which has not already slipped, stands high and contains thick beds of soft matter between the courses of stone, it will, in all probability, give way in small portions, and tumble upon the adjacent part of the under-cliff; but the under-cliff itself seems to be anchor ed upon the rocks beneath, and capable of bidding defiance to the utmost violence both of the weather and the waves, the more especially that the set of the current from Brixton and Chale bays is projected obliquely against it, and tends to re move its violence from this point of the shore. It is by no means improbable that the land-slips may extend westward as far as there are any rocks alternating with the soft strata in the cliff, and that Black-gang chine may, in time, have a mass"], [94, "70 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of ruins at its base, in the same manner as the cliff to the eastward, though the- fact of the existence of a chine, and the discharge ofthe rain-water by the rivulet there, are somewhat against the occurrrence of such a catastrophe. While there fore the sea may be considered as gradually invading and wasting away the land at the back of the Island, from the Needles to near Black-gang chine, the disruptions which have taken place in the higher rock, or cliff, to the eastward of this as far as Boniface down, seem to defy any violent destruction of the Island in this particular quarter. What has now been stated is peculiar, and not unworthy the atten tion of those who look at the causes of things, \u2014 in as much as it shows that the destruction of a certain portion of the margin of a high land much exposed to the sea and weather, may become the means of saving the rest. In the strata of this part of the Island, the subterraneous forest, if it ever existed here, does not anywhere come above, or up to, the level of the sea, as it does in the Isle of Portland; and therefore, we may presume that the action from below, by means of which the strata were upheaved; and the chalk disrupted and removed, has not been quite so violent here as it has been farther to the west. We should come to the same conclusion upon other data, \u2014 inasmuch as the se condary strata are not found, and the granite and other rocks projected from below, which belong to much earlier forma tions, do not make their appearance as at Dartmoor in Devon. The tertiary strata, over the chalk, in the northern part of the Island, are not less worthy of attention than the strata below the chalk on the south. As is the case with those on the south side, they are not the same, at all places, either in consistency or in composition, neither are they quite analogous to those which are met with in any other district; but still, the resemblance is sufficient to enable us to identify the whole formation, although not perhaps the individual beds. Immediately over this chalk there is a succession of beds of sand and plastic clay ; and over these there is the London clay, or an aluminous formation agreeing in its ge-"], [95, "71 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. neral characters with that which occurs in the valley of the Thames ; and above this, there is found the same capping of sand which is met with in other places, where the tertiary series is entire in itself, but has nothing over it of fresh water, or estuaral origin. In Alum bay, the whole of these beds may be seen in the utmost perfection ; and, as the London clay is the most decomposable of the whole, by the action of the surface water, the ravine which leads to the hotel on the beach, has been excavated chiefly in this for mation. Though well seen in the very irregularly-formed and variously-coloured cliffs which constitute that eastern margin of the bay upon which the sea and the storm are committing such fantastic havoc, these formations cannot be so easily traced along the northern edge of the chalk downs. In some place, they probably vary in their own composition, and in others, the matters above have not only overlaid them, but have penetrated partially through the gorges in the chalk ridges, and thus hidden the tertiary beds, strictly so called, how complete soever they may be in their number and ar rangement, under this covering. As they form the immediate basis of the vegetable mould, and mingling Avith it compose the soil, their formations are ex ceedingly varied ; and, in order to understand these, we must return to the section at Alum bay, where the greater number, if not the whole that occur in the Island, are here presented in section, and can be easily examined. Immediately over the London clay, which we have alluded to asbeing found near the dell or ravine which leads to the bottom of the bay \u2014 that is to the eastern beach, there is an extensive bed of sand, which is however much thinner where it crops out against the top of the cliff, than it is downwards. This arises from the strata above the sand having much less inclination to the horizon than the strata under it. When the whole were upheaved, it should seem that this sand, as being the stratum of loosest texture, had been pressed out near the suaface, between the London clay on the one hand, and the superincumbent strata on the other. In consequence of the small inclination"], [96, "72 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of the beds under Headen hill, the sand immediately over the London clay forms the basis of the centre cliff there ; and as, notwithstanding the small cohesion of its parts, it is much less absorbent of moisture, and therefore less liable to de composition than the plastic clays and sands under the London clay, whicb , containing various absorbent matters, as well as various admixtures of iron, decompose far more readily than this sand, but in so irregular a manner as to give the cliffs composed of them, a most singular appearance, whether as seen from above or from below, but more espe cially the latter. It is from a portion of this sand over the Lon don clay, which is so free from all admixture as to be almost pure white, that sand is dug and exported for the purposes of making flint glass ; and it should seem that, whenever this sand over the London clay occurs in volume, especially when it is overlaid by other matters, a portion of it is always remarkable for its purity ; and though of no value as a soil, except in the way of drainage, it is serviceable in all branches of the art, where pure silica is required. Over this sand, the upper surface of which is very nearly horizontal, there are deposited the succession of fresh-water estuaral, and alluvial deposits, which form the uppermost and the peculiar strata of this part of the Island. Immediately over the sand which lies upon the London clay, there occurs a bed of sand and clay, the clay usually of a dark colour, and containing vast numbers of fresh-water shells, but never a marine one. It is pretty evident thatthis deposit, which in all its different beds is about sixty-three feet in thickness, has been originally made in a lake or the lower valley of a fresh water river ; and this after the accumulation of the sand be low, which sand, being wholly without fossil remains of any descripton whatsoever, leaves us in doubt whether to refer it entirely to the salt-water formation, entirely to the fresh water, or partly to the one and partly to the other. The near ly perfect level of the stratum shows not only that it has been formed in fresh-water subject to very little disturbance, but that it has been formed in a situation of the surface, very"], [97, "73 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. different from that which it now occupies. The formation it self consists of various beds of limestone and marl, some times quite friable, sometimes compact, and sometimes alter nating with strata containing a considerable proportion of silex, and thus being very durable as building-stone. In all the varieties of formation and consistency, there has not however been a single marine remain found in this bed. Immediately over it lies the upper marine or estuaral for- mation, which has obviously not been deposited from searwa- ter alone, like the marine beds properly so called, but by the joint action of the sea and fresh-water. This would seem to indicate that this part of the Island, as far as this parti- cular formation can be traced, had been so far submerged by a depression of sudden occurrence, or by the disruption of the dam of a lake, and changed from the bed of that to an arm of the sea. This estuaral formation is between thirty and forty feet thick, at least as it appears on the cliffs ; and the greenish marl, of which it is in general composed, bears a considerable resemblance to many parts of the fresh-water formation below it, \u2014 a resemblance so close indeed as to render it very unlikely that any long interval had taken place between the formation of this middle bed and the one under it. The marl, of which this formation chiefly consists, is re- markably full of small shells, chiefly estuaral andlittoral ones, just such as one might be prepared to expect in a formation which had been gradually worked together in a tidal estuary. Besides the smaller shells, which are so very abundant, the formation contains also oyster shells, in large numbers where they do occur, but only in particular spots; and we know that to live and to breed in patches is the habit of the oysters which are still to be met with on our shores. After the formation of this estuaral bed, the surface ap pears again to have been elevated, or otherwise sub jected to the action of fresh-water in very much the same manner as when the lower fresh-water bed was formed. Like the former, this upper fresh-water group, or system of beds, contains numerous fresh-water shells, but none of the marine L"], [98, "74 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. ones contained in the formation below; and, like the other fresh-water group, it consists of various alternations of lime stone and marl \u2014 the siliceous matter and the marl being usually of a sort of yellowish or greenish colour. It is from one or other of these fresh-water beds that the building-stone found in the north part of the Island is ob tained ; and, from the similarity and composition of the two formations, it cannot be very different, whether obtained from one or the other. From the inequalities of height along a line, drawn from these strata where they appear in the cliff of Alum bay to about Binstead a little to the westward of Ryde, owing to the beds of the streams which flow from the southward, and the various heights between those streams, sometimes one and sometimes another of these fresh-water and estuaral formations, appears uppermost, constituting the surface-rock, or sub-soil immediately under the vegetable mould. These strata themselves too are not continuous \u2014 at least ofthe same consistency; for, apparently the very same bed furnishes compact and durable siliceous limestone in one patch, as for instance at Quar abbey \u2014 from the quarries of which some of the most ancient, and at the same time undecayed, portions of Winchester cathedral are understood to have been built ; and at other times the consistency is little better than that of a sort of pasty chalk. Above the upper fresh water formation, Headen hill, within Hatherwood point, is capped with alluvial matters, and these are found in other places, both on the heights and in the hollows ; and small as the rivers in this part of the Isle of Wight now are, there has once been a considerable power of running fresh-water, not covering it as a general flood, but pursuing its regular course over the surface. At what period this was the case, we cannot tell in years as measured by the revolution of the earth on its orbit, for this standard has not yet been ascertained to be an element in the measure of geologic time ; but it is certain that those alluvial deposits have been formed posterior to any general sub-"], [99, "75 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. merging of that which now constitutes the general surface of the Island. Remains of the elephant \u2014 in all proba bility the northern elephant, which was adapted to cold climates, have been found in them, as well as indications of other mammalia ; and though there are fishes and rep tiles, and we believe, though the evidence is not very clear, a single instance of a marsupial animal, discovered in formations which have subsequently been long under the waters of the ocean, and covered with fresh marine de posits, yet the remains of mammalia, analogous to those now upon the earth, are found in simple and gradual accumulations of rubbish, such as we see in progress by the fresh-waters of almost every country. From the comparative flatness of the fresh-water strata in the north parts of the Island, and the nearly vertical position of the tertiary, from the upper sand to the chalk, it will be readily understood that, except where the former are cut through by hollows, the intermixtures of sandy layers with plastic and London clay must occupy but a very narrow belt or zone along the northern side of the downs ; and that farther, from their vertical position, they must ap pear as streaks, alternating with each other at short intervals. Not only this ; for the fresh-water and alluvial formations advance upon them in some places, as already stated, and thus reduce the surface-strata in this part of the Island, to a sort of checquer-work, varying in breadth from north to south, and in length from east to west. In one place there is pipe-clay in a state of purity ; in another there is sand, with very little binding matter mixed with it; in a third there is marl, variously tinged with iron ; in a fourth there is gravel ; and all of these, which vary in particular quality as well as in general name, more or less blended with de composed vegetable matters, render the soil of this part of the Island far more varied in quality than the trifling diffe rences of elevation in the surface would lead one to suppose ; and thus, any slight differences of climate which are met l 2"], [100, "76 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. with in the Island, northward of the chalk-ridge, must be attributed to the soil rather than to the atmosphere. The whole of this part of the Island, at least with the exception of the high sandy hills extending from Alum bay toward the estuary of the Yarmouth river, and which form a sort of barrier against the sea-winds from the west, may be said to be peculiarly favorable to the growth of timber, and nowhere very unfavourable for agricultural purposes. It is true, that the marls, which form great part of the surface, more especially at some distance from the chalk ridge, are light and friable, and often intermixed Avith sand, so that the crops upon them are not heavy, but they are of excellent quality ; and such a soil is remarkably well suited to the growth of the more useful roots which enter into the subsistence of man, or of domesticated animals. Trees too do not attain a very large size ; and the decay of their leaves is rather early. This is in part owing to the dry nature of the soil, very little of which is retentive of humidity ; and therefore, after the rains of early autumn are over, the surface is scorched, and the soil empoverished by the action of the sun. Where trees are abundant they tend greatly to counteract this ; because a tree, when in growth, levies a contribution of humidity upon the atmo- sphere up to its very summit, and also protects the ground by its shade. Hence, on this side of the Island, those spots of ground which are pretty thickly interspersed with trees always show a vegetation so much more luxuriant than that upon naked places, that the trees give evidence of amply paying for the space they occupy, independently altogether of their value as timber. Like most places of the south of England, it is highly probable that the Isle of Wight, especially this side of it, which is sheltered from the sea air by the chalk downs, and has its soil so well adapted for receiving the roots of trees, was, once, more richly wooded than it is now. The woods may, as on many parts of the mainland, have been cut down wantonly by conquerors or invaders, from the shelter which"], [101, "77 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. they afforded to the people warred against ; or, as has been and is still the case in many places, they may have been injudiciously cut down by the proprietors, from the avarice of an ignorant economy, from necessity, or from various other causes ; but it is certain that, whatever may have been the means, mode, or motive in their destruction, the woods in the. Island were far more luxuriant, extensive, ornamental, and valuable, both in themselves and to the ground, than they are now ; nor is there any doubt that, if a little more judicious planting of rightly-selected species of trees were practised upon the more naked parts of the Island, both its beauty and its value would be greatly increased. This is in part applicable both to the south side of the chalk ridge and to the north ; but more especially to the former, which, with by much the better soil in some places, is by far the more naked. The wild woods in Brook chine, the beauti ful groves of Northcourt at Shorwell, those at Yarford, and a few other places between the downs and the sea, where the low lands are narrowed and most exposed, afford decisive evidence that the sea air here is not very peculiarly injurious to the growth of timber, even at a trifling distance from the shore, and where the sea winds beat against the land in the utmost of their violence. The downs in the southern part of the Island, from St. Catherine's to Shanklin, being composed chiefly of oolitic marl of some description or other \u2014 the green-sand being confined to the valley \u2014 admit of culture, or of plantation, as may be preferred, up to the very tops. Upon their sum mits and their southern slopes, these doAvns are rather bleak, and the soil upon them is in some places thin ; but still, they are much better adapted for strong-growing vegetation than the chalk down which traverses the centre of the Island. Their northern escarpment, in which pleasant little valleys are formed by the projecting points, is in many spots well wooded; and in some, as about Appuldercomb and its neighbourhood, there are luxuriant and beautiful trees, which contrast, in a very pleasing manner, with the rich"], [102, "78 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. lawns, meadows, and corn-fields; and indeed, whenever there are trees upon this northward slope of the downs, and especially in the rich bottoms immediately under their steep escarpments, those trees are healthy and thriving. The hedge-rows too, in many spots hereabouts, are parti cularly luxuriant ; and, though they conceal the country from the traveller, they are in themselves shady and pleasant when the weather is warm. It is chiefly upon the sandy heights to the westward of the upper course of the Medina, that plantations are wanted, to replace the furze and other wild bushes with which patches here and there are still covered ; and which tell, by their luxuriance, that the soil is worthy of more profitable occupation. It is true, that sand is the prevailing earth for some distance here ; and also, that it is the same formation, namely the green sand of the upper oolitic series, which forms the naked heaths on the eastern part of Hampshire to the south of the northern chalk ridge which extends into Guil ford downs, but still, though of the same formation, in a syste matic point of view, the sand here is of a more marly or loamy consistency than in the place of the mainland alluded to ; and therefore, as the climate is certainly not inferior, it is better adapted for all purposes of production. The means of improving it are also abundant, and at no great distance ; for, if she marl of the downs to the south, and the chalk of those to the north previously burnt into lime, were skil fully and sufficiently applied to this soil, it would not fail in being exceedingly fertile. Even as matters stand, and notwithstanding the diversi ties of the surface, the Isle of Wight must be regarded as possessing, upon the whole, a fertile soil, though one which requires attention, and which, from the paucity of timber in some places, is at present too much exposed to the ele ments. As it is, the crops are moderately abundant, and, with a little attention to differences of soil and exposure, all the agricultural crops, whether cereal or leguminous, may be grown to a great advantage. The lighter lands are"], [103, "79 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. remarkably well adapted for the growth of peas, and the garden sorts grown on them are particularly delicious. The clays again, or the deep and strong loams, are equally well adapted to the growth of beans. In short, there is no species of crop, usually grown by the British farmer, for which an appropriate locality may not be found here. The produce per acre does not perhaps equal that of the mid land counties of England, and probably not of some dis tricts in the south ; but the quality is superior, and generally speaking the harvests are well got in. From its peculiar nature, the soil does not very readily form good meadows ; and therefore artificial grasses are cultivated to a considerable extent and succeed well. On the old mea dows however, which are favourably situated, and have been a sufficient number of years under grass, both the pasturage and the hay are good. On the corn lands, the produce of the south side of the Island is said to be from one-third to one-fourth more per acre than that of the north ; and this not on particular spots only, but taken on the average ; and the rents of arable lands in the two districts are nearly in the same proportion. The chalk downs, throughout their whole extent, furnish an exceedingly healthy pasturage for sheep ; and though these are probably not quite so numerous as they were formerly, they are understood still to amount to forty thousand. The downs are found to be exceedingly healthy, and the lower pastures to have comparatively little tendency to produce rot in sheep ; while, as the angry winds, from the inland moors, or from the east, which are injurious to sheep in the early season in some other districts, are quite unknown here ; the lambs are very healthy, as well as very forward in the season. Accordingly, an immense number of these, amounting, it is said, to about an eighth part of the whole stock of sheep kept in the Island, is annually sent to the London market. There is, besides the number of full-grown sheep consumed in the Island, or sent out of it, a very handsome return upon this single article"], [104, "80 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of husbandry. In respect of cattle, either for the butcher or the dairy, the Island does not stand very high, \u2014 corn crops being found more advantageous on most places which would otherAvise suit for cattle grazings. Of course there are cattle fatted, but the number sold out of the Island is not such as to make this a very important article. The cows are generally of the Jersey, or as it may be termed the Norman, breed, which though not a preferable breed for cheese dairies, are yet valuable as furnishing superior milk, cream, and butter. All these three articles are of the finest quality ; but what little cheese is made is flavourless, and as hard as paving-stones. Hogs are pretty numerous, and the large spotted breed is in general preferred. From the number of hogs at which the pannage of a district is estimated in Doomsday Book, we are enabled to judge of its condition with regard to wood at the time of the Conquest. Now, when we examine that record, we find that there is not mentioned, in Doomsday Book, pannage for much above fifty hogs, and the whole of these are confined to one particular tract of the Island, namely, that to the westward of what used to be the royal forest of Parkhurst, and between Bowcomb down and Newtown bay. This part of the country lying low, being tolerably well wa tered, and consisting, for the most part, of deep loams and clays, is naturally well adapted to the growth of timber; and hence we may conclude that, besides the upward and bleaker portion to the east, which remained a royal forest until times comparatively recent, the natural wood \u2014 for it does not appear that there were any planted woods in those days, extended into the lower and richer grounds. It seems however, from the ploughs, and mills, and meadows, and inhabitants, which the same record enumerates on the same district, that a considerable breadth of the surface had been cleared of wood and turned into corn-fields previous to the time of the Conquest. In more early times, it is probable that the forest here was more extensive as well as more dense, and that it had been inhabited by the wild-boar"], [105, "81 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. and the stag, as the tusks of the former have been met with, among other relics, in the barrows which have been opened upon the downs. But still, from this locality of the forest hogs, as noticed in the Doomsday Survey, we may con clude that, in the early times, there was little or no wood to the southward of the chalk downs, and that the hog was then comparatively unknown in all that part of the Island. At present, the numbers are very considerable ; and, as is usual in Hampshire, form a staple article in the food of the people ; though from their size, they are better adapted for bacon hogs than for porkers. The agriculture of the Island does not differ much from that of the mainland of Hampshire; and the farming, though not conducted upon what are perhaps considered the most scientific principles, is still respectable, and the corn lands are usually clean and in neat order. Many of the country roads are inconveniently narrow and hilly, and some of them are very bad; but the main roads are in general very good. The whole Island is remarkably well stocked with game, especially with hares, partridges, and pheasants; in en couraging all the breeds of which, the former governors of the Island, who in this aped, upon a small scale, the con duct of the kings of old, were particularly assiduous. These animals were also made subjects of royal solicitude; and Henry VIII, while he was taking the requisite steps for clearing the Island, as well as other parts of England, of monks, who, though not in all cases Nimrods themselves, were yet great consumers of game, issued a somewhat curious mandate to the captain of the Island, in favour of pheasants and partridges. In 1541, the year after the suppression of St. Mary's abbey, at Winchester, which is recorded to have been first founded by Alfred's queen, Henry issued a mandate to R. Worsley, the then captain of the Island, in these terms: \u2014 \"To have diligent regarde, and vigilant eye, that no man, of no degree nor condition, kill any fesant, nor partriche, with net, engine, or hawk, on M"], [106, "82 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. any our proper lands in the same Isle, taking the netts and engynes of all such as shall attempt the contrary, and fur ther punishing the parties soe offending, as to your wisdom shall be thought convenyent.\" It must not be understood, however, that this command of Henry had reference to the whole Island; for \"our proper lands,\" obviously refer only to Parkhurst forest, and such other lands as might be in the actual possession of the crown ; and, after all, the order is not more severe, than that which any country proprietor may issue to his gamekeepers any day, \u2014 only the modern offenders are not punished according to the wisdom and convenience of a king's officer, or of the proprietor's bailiff, but according to those of the local justices of the quorum ; and thus, the relative degree of Avisdom and convenience, exercised toward a poacher in 1541, and 1841, or after a lapse of three hundred years, is an indeterminate problem, which we shall not attempt to solve. There is no fox-hunting in the Isle of Wight ; and for this plain reason, that there are no foxes to hunt: and, for the same reason, there can be no badger drawing, unless a badger is imported for the purpose. The polecat is also unknown, and we believe all species of the weasel family, ( Mustelid\u00e6 ) are exceedingly rare. Whether any of these animals have been exterminated, there is no precise historical account. One of the governors, or captains of the Island, ap pears to have been equally solicitous to increase the breed of hares, for he is reported to have offered a lamb, to eveiy one who should bring a live hare into the Island, \u2014 which, by the way, had very much the appearance of a bounty upon poaching in the adjoining mainland. Rabbits abound in the sandy tracts, especially in those toward Alum bay ; and it does not appear that there is any want of the smaller Rodentia, which have, in some instances, proved more de structive to young plantations, than all other animals put together. For the keeping down of these small animals, (which, in the years, 1813, and 1814, threatened, and, to a considerable extent*, accomplished, the destruction of all the"], [107, "83 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. young trees in the Forest of Dean.) there is thus no natural provision. This fact borne in mind, lets one see, that the ab sence of the smaller predatory mammalia, is nothing to boast of in the way of conserving young plantations, and promot ing the Avealth of the Island, and ameliorating its soil by an increase of timber, how much soever it may have conduced to the increase of hares and rabbits, partridges and pheasants, the last of which, are not very profitable neighbours to a farmer. How the badger came at first to be included among animals destructive of game it is not very easy to conceive ; for though this animal may occasionally eat a mouse, or a bird's egg, yet it is so slow in its motions, and so inoffensive in its manners, that it is not likely to commit any very se rious depredation in the open field, or the preserve. There is no doubt that the absence of predatory mamma lia contributes somewhat to the increase of the numbers of birds of all kinds, because the weasel tribe are both lythe and cunning, able to squeeze their way silently through very small openings, and thus become great destroyers of ground birds, as well as of their eggs ; but whether this be any advantage is also a matter not easily settled. Those mem bers of the feathered race which are most useful to man in the destruction of insects and their larv\u00e6, whose colours and motions are most pleasing to the eye, and whose songs are most sweet to the ear, generally nestle and roost beyond the reach of those animals ; and thus, in as far as such ani mals are concerned, they are but little affected by their presence or their absence. There are other destroyers of game, and of the feathered race, which the sea will not exclude, and as it is a law of nature that animals shall always be found in every district something in the ratio of the food there is for them, \u2014 it is probable that raptorial birds, and also the egg-eating crows and magpies, are more nume rous in the Island in consequence of the comparatively small numbers of their quadruped rivals. Eagles are not much known in the Island, or, at all events, they are rarely if ever seen, as the high doAvns there are not well suited for m 2"], [108, "84 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. an eagle's pasture ; but, with the exception of the jer, the goshawk, and we suspect the peregrine \u2014 though report says it once bred in the rocks of Culver cliff, most of the hawks are found in the Island. All the resident birds of similar loca lities in the south of England, and the migratory ones, are in abundance, \u2014 many of the last collecting upon the downs pre paratory to taking the autumnal flight to their winter quarters, in more genial climates, and all kinds of domesticated birds of the farm-yard and the pond are abundant, and thrive well ; in deed, the fine climate and the comparatively mild winter of the Island, render it peculiarly favourable for every species of life, except of those lurid tenants of rank and damp places, which thrive best in a pestilent atmosphere. It was once supposed that, in consequence of the mildness of the air at the back of the Island upon the under cliff, the little glades among the rocky fragments there, which are composed of very fertile soil, have a southward exposure, and are not destitute of water, might be well adapted for the cultivation of the vine ; and accordingly, Sir Richard Worsley, the then possessor of Appuldurcomb, resolved to make the experiment near his marine cottage or villa below Week down ; and, with this intention, he procured from France, in 1792, the requisite number of plants of white muscadine and plante verde, and also employed a French vigneron, accustomed to their treatment in his own country, to undertake the management. A plantation of about three acres, and containing seven hundred vine plants, was imme diately formed, together with a smaller one planted in a succession of terraces, with trellis placed against the back of each stage or terrace, to which the plants might be trained. The plants grew with sufficient vigour ; for vines are remarkable for their vitality, and will put forth shoots, and spread leaves, in almost any climate excepting the \"regions of thick-ribbed ice\" itself. But this spirited and patriotic experimenter forgot one essential part of the business : it is not the growth of twigs and branches which is the essential part of a vineyard ; for too much of these"], [109, "85 GEOLOGY AND SOIL. is an evil rather than a good, and mars rather than promotes the main object of the vine-grower. In winter, the vine is the most quiescent of plants ; and, at that season, if its roots are protected from the frost, no severity of the aK mosphere will injure the above-ground stems, or the buds, folded up as they are in very secure hybernacula. One thing however is essentially necessary ; and this is, that the heat of the season shall be* so concentrated into those months during which the vine is in action, as to stimulate it to the production of clusters instead of tendrils, which last are the abortive product of every vine, which, by mere exuberance of its vegetation, runs too much to stem and leaf. The temperature should not only be such as to stimulate the re-productive energy of the plant \u2014 which always requires more heat and less humidity than the mere enlargement of its own volume, but it should also augment without rain, in the latter part of the season, so as to give maturity and flavour to the clusters. This most essential part of the matter does not wholly depend upon the absolute temperature of the later summer and autumnal months, but in some degree also upon the relative proportion between the temperature at this time of the year, and that of the winter. The perfect repose of a seasonal plant during the winter, is one element of the energy which it brings to meet the stimulus of the new season ; and if this is deficient, as com pared with the autumnal warmth, such a plant as the vine will not ripen its fruit. Hence, the experiment of Sir Richard was a failure, not because the average annual teperature of the undercliff in the Isle of Wight, is lower than that of the north of France, in which the grapes that we have named come regularly to maturity, and are profitably employed in the manufacture of a pleasant light wine, but because the difference between the winter and summer temperature was too small for the wholesome working of the vines. The consequence was that, when the fruit did ripen in a season more than usually warm, it had not strength and flavour enough for making good wine ; and when the years were"], [110, "86 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of average character, the grapes did not ripen at all. The fault of this was not in any way in the management, but wholly in the uniform temperature of a locality so near the sea-level, and so habitually acted upon by the soft south winds of the Atlantic. The same want of success must attend every similar attempt, when made close to the sea-coast in every locality of the south of England ; and if it be true, as is sometimes alleged, that vineyards were not uncommon, and were cultivated with success, a little way inland in the early ages, that of itself is a proof of a greater difference between the summer and the winter temperature at those times than there is now ; and this, without any reference to the fact as to whether the whole year was upon the average warmer or the reverse. This fact accords with what is usually stated in history, as to the Romanised Britons, and the monks of the early times.-. making wines from grapes, at various places along the southern coast. In their days, the country was more wooded and humid in some places, and more naked of summer vegetation in others, than it is now ; and the con sequence was, as is still evinced in North America, and in other countries similarly circumstanced, that the difference between the temperature of winter and summer was far greater than it is in our highly-cultivated country, which is kept comparatively warm in winter and cold in summer, by the shelter of the field-crops and the evaporation from their growing surfaces. This is the reason of the failure of the vines in the experiment ; and, for the same reason, every other such experiment must fail ; and thus the people will act wisely in continuing to cultivate such plants only as are adapted to a mild and uniform succession of seasons."], [111, "87 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. CHAPTER IV. PECULIAR CHARACTERS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT. It is these peculiar characters, whether we consider them as beauties or as singularities \u2014 and it is in many instances difficult to decide whether they more deserve the one epithet or the other, which draw so many visitors to this Island, and which afford them so rich and varied a scenic treat, in sup- plement to the healthful air, and excellent accommodation, which every frequented part of the Island affords. But, though these peculiar characters have much and deep interest, they well might set description at defiance; for, like the Arabian Tales, they are a \" thousand and one\" \u2014 all somewhat in the same style, and that style a very enchanting one, but still so varied from each other that each one is a novelty, and they who are capable of appreciating such subjects are never tired, even at a third, a fourth, or a fifth visit. To enjoy them fully they must be seen ; there must be leisure to see them ; and none but a pedestrian who can thread a brake and climb a precipice, can fully appreciate them. The most singular of them admit of, and indeed require, a double view ; for, after the under-cliff for instance has been traversed from east to west, in the unnumbered succession"], [112, "88 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of its enchanting scenes, a return from west to east affords a new view of each, as fresh and as full of novelty as the former. Not only this ; for, in this particular part of the Island, there is a near landscape, and a bird's-eye view, \u2014 the former obtained from the road under the cliffs, and the latter from the foot-path, or the down along their brow, from which and from which alone, one can form a correct notion of the surface of this very extraordinary district. A mere ride or drive along the carriage-road, though highly interesting, affords one no adequate notion of the singular compound of all sorts of scenery which are to be met with here. The whole length of the under-cliff should be taken in traverses, so that the observer may be now on the shore, and now under the beetling rocks, according as the one or the other gives him the most advantageous prospect. This is labori ous certainly, and the due performance of it would require a number of days ; but to such as can afford it, they are days well spent in the acquisition of health and enjoyment. No verbal description, and no ordinary effort of the pencil, can aid very much in communicating a correct knowledge of this museum of beauties produced by ruin. Any one who would understand them must go himself and collect the bundle of rods ; and all that description can do, even in the hands of those who are most devoted to nature, and most familiar with it, is to supply the bit of cord, or vinculum, by means of which subjects so numerous and so varied may be united into something like a system. In order to prepare the reader for this highly-intellectual treat, and to assist him so that he may return from the sight of this Island Avith more than the mere casual re mark that it is \" wonderfully beautiful,\" it is necessary to glance at the map, to bear the geological structure of the different portions in mind, and to examine, and consider well, how they are acted upon by the atmosphere and the tide ; for in these circumstances, variously blended, are to be found the natural causes of everything that is peculiarly striking in this justly celebrated Island."], [113, "89 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. In the greater part of the Island, the chalk ridge, from the Needles in the west to Culver cliff in the east, is to be taken as the centre of observation, or as the axis of judg ment whereby we are to arrive at those general principles which enable us to put our individual observations toge ther in something like a rational and instructive manner. This axis is completely interrupted at Freshwater gate toward the west, and at Yar bridge toward Brading har bour on the east ; and it is partially interrupted at some other places, as for example on the lines of the Medina and Carisbrook stream. Northward, throughout the whole length of the Island, we have the tertiary formations over the chalk; and southward we have, generally speaking, the formations under the chalk, mostly marine, but with some few traces of fresh-water, or at all events, estuaral deposits, which last are about the lowest that make their appearance tm the shores where the sea is making inroads, and there is not a trace of them anywhere in the interior of the Island. The chalk is again partially found in the south-eastern downs, and gives them quite a different character from the middle downs to the westward of Appuldurcomb. But even in these south-eastern parts, the chalk is deeply overlaid with gravel, so that, unless where paths or other openings have been made at some height above the sea, it does not make its appearance, neither does it form any portion of those cliffs which stand beetling out, and give evidence that they have been formed by land-slips, or by the disintegrating influence of the sea. Between these, there is a distinction which must be carefully attended to by every one who wishes to understand those physical characters of the Island from which its present appearance has resulted. If the chalk comes down to the sea-level, then the process which goes on is total destruction ; and, although large masses of the chalky cliffs are, from time to time, loosened from the rest, and precipitated into the water, yet no land is ever formed at the base of such a cliff, nor does the largest mass of ruin which tumbles in such a place, act as a barrier N"], [114, "90 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. against fresh ruin, excepting for a very little time. The chalk itself is speedily converted into mud, which is strewed upon the banks, and in the eddies of the sheltered shores ; and the flints, Avhere such are found, go to augment the number of pebbles on the beach, and the drift of those pebbles which is constantly setting eastward in the direc tion of Dover. The tertiary formation, at least as it occurs on the north side of the Island, has also little tendency to produce land-slips, because the prevailing part of it is either sand, or it is so little exposed to the action of the water as that scarcely any disintegration is going on. Where the formations under the chalk consist of sand or clay, with few or no beds of compact stone intervening, they have also but little tendency to form land-slips, except upon very small scales, the debris occasioned by which is very speedily dis solved by the water ; and thus the inroad of the sea upon shores of either of these consistencies is constant, or varies only with the varying weather of different years. When, however, beds of sand-stone, whether more ferruginous or containing more lime, alternate with the plastic clays, \u2014 the latter more especially, if they are in thick beds, are apt to give way ; and the weight of the former, being deprived of support from below, breaks short, and hurls down the whole mass, forming a new character of land under the base of those cliffs from which it parted, and having the stone scattered about in great masses, of the most varied shapes, and often in the most singular positions. It is the contrast of shores of this description, with those of the other description previously mentioned, that gives to the Isle of Wight the principal charm which attracts visitors to wonder at its margins ; and we have only to at tend to the kind of formation which abuts upon the sea, and to its height above the common sea-level, in order to prepare ourselves for the kind of shore we are to expect in any part of the Island. As the whole Island consists of stratified rocks \u2014 or strata of some kind or other which have been formed in water under some circumstances, we cannot"], [115, "PECULIAR CHARACTERS. 91 presume any very constant uniformity of character along a considerable extent of shore. The present surface of the earth is our best means of judging of the nature of those strata which have formerly constituted its surface, whether in the bed of the ocean, or elevated above the sea-level. We find resemblances of surface extending often to a considera ble distance ; but in all cases, local variations occur at short intervals \u2014 such as clay in one place, sand in another, lime or marl in a third, and so on in an endless variety, both of mixtures and their prevailing ingredients ; and, as all depo sited strata have been the result of surface-action, carried on by the waters, the atmosphere, or both, \u2014 the same in nature as are now wasting land in some places, and adding to it in others, we must be prepared to expect the same want of uniformity, in even the deepest of those strata which we meet with in the present surface. Where unstratified rocks, or rocks which have been formed below the surface, with out the immediate agency of water or air, and elevated by causes, also acting below the surface, whether directly as heat or not, we find a greater uniformity ; although here, the volcanic rocks, properly so called, differ much more in their appearance and composition, than the granites, and other earth-born rocks, upon which no effect of fire is visi ble. There is not a single earth-born rock apparent any where in the Isle of Wight, or in the adjacent seas; and, therefore, we must be prepared to meet everywhere with those local varieties which are characteristic of strata re sulting from aqueous deposits. Making such allowances, Ave find certain portions of the Isle of Wight shore, widely apart from each other \u2014 in at least as far as the word widely can be applied to a small island, and yet corresponding in their main character, and in the scenery as resulting from that character, only with the local differences to which we have above alluded. Thus, for instance, we haATe a similarity, though not an absolute sameness, in the eastern and western extremities of the Is land, \u2014 in the chalk cliffs, from the Needles under Afton n 2"], [116, "92 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. down on the west, and in Culver cliffs in the east. The eastern cliffs, as exposed to the action of the water, are much less extensive than the western cliffs, \u2014 the extent of absolute chalk there being less than one mile ; whereas, in the west of the Island, it is nearly five miles. Culver cliffs have, also, not above two-thirds the elevation of those at the Needles, the summit in the one place rising more than 600 feet above the level of the sea, and in the other not above 400 feet. There are still other points of resemblance, White cliff bay in the east, for instance, bearing some resemblance to Alum bay in the west ; and the whole coast, from the Culver cliffs to the entrance of Brading harbour, bearing some resemblance to that from the Needles to Cliffs-end, opposite Hurst castle. At both places we have the meeting of the chalk, and of the strata over the chalk, displayed in the escarpment of the cliffs ; but these strata are not quite the same in the two places, although, in both, their position shows evident marks of disturbance, very different from what we shall meet with in some other parts of the Island. The coast from Cliffs-end, or from Carey's sconce a little to the north-east of Cliffs-end, all the way round to the entrance of Brading harbour, is very different from that which we have been attempting to describe. It consists of very varied portions of the tertiary formation, changing from durable rock to unadhesive sand ; and as is usual upon coasts of this formation, where no violent action of the sea breaks upon them, there is nothing striking in the outline of the mere land. Taken in itself it is tame, consisting of an alterna tion of gentle swells and hollows ; and with the exception of some rocks on each side of Gurnet bay to the westward of Cowes, it comes down with a tame slope to a flat beach. Thus, in so far as the meeting of sea and land, and the effects of the one upon the other on this north side of the Island, are concerned, there is nothing of interest ; and as, except ing in a few spots, the land is not naturally of a rich cha racter, it owes whatever of beauty it possesses to the labour of man. For this however, if judiciously applied the"], [117, "93 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. country is remarkably well adapted ; and thus, though there are no natural \" sights \" along this part of the Island, there are many elements of quiet scenic beauty. Upon the high grounds, single trees, or indeed deciduous trees of any kind do not thrive well, and upon the summits and upper slopes facing to the west, such as do occur are stunted, and have their ragged tops bent to the north-east ; but, unless in the most exposed situations, they are not so covered with lichen as on the richer soil to the south of the chalk downs. In the bottoms trees grow luxuriantly, and as they will thrive down almost to the water s edge, Avhich is scooped into very fine little bays, they make a very rich and pleasing coast, as seen from the water. Uniform repose and quietness are, however the predominating characters of the whole surface ; and therefore, good taste demands that the mansions, villas, and cottages, for the situation of which this coast is so finely adapted, should be in keeping. Many of them are delight fully so, but here and there a castellated fabric, peering through or over the quiet grove, spoils the congruity and keeping of the scene, which judiciously adapted structures would make perfect. Scenery of the calm and beautiful kind to which we have alluded, is rarely to be met with, in finer perfection, than in some of the favoured spots around this coast ; but it is altoge ther too tame for being grand, neither is there anything picturesque about it, or capable of being rendered so ; for if the attempt were made, the result would be incongruity and failure. If we now turn to the coasts of the Island, south of the chalk cliffs, we find a similar correspondence, and a similar disparity, to those which appear immediately to the north ward of the Needles, and of Culver cliffs. From the western chalk to Rocken-end, a distance of about nine miles, we have the sea gradually invading the land, and leaving no remain, save here and there a cluster of rocks, which add greatly to the perils of a line of coast, the beach and surf upon which are of themselves abundantly dangerous. If again, we turn"], [118, "94 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. our attention eastward, from Dunnose, or rather from the chine of Luccomb, we find another line of coast, which is in a state of disintegration without any land-slip, or any ten dency to the formation of an under-cliff. It is true that, from Luccomb to Shanklin, many masses of rock have tumbled from the disintegrated cliffs, and lie in ruins at the base, while straggling ones occur for at least a mile to the north ward of Shanklin. From Luccomb chine northward, however, there appears to be no stratum which has a tendency to slip, at least in any considerable quantity ; and therefore, there is a simple wearing away of the face of the cliffs, without the production of any new surface, upon which vegetation can be found. The escarpment of the downs, both along the shore, and in the interior, shows a different formation here, than what we meet with at the back of the Island properly so called ; and, as Shanklin is approached, nothing which can be called rock, in the common meaning of the term, presents itself in the section ofthe cliffs. Ferruginous sand, more or less marly, and variously tinged with iron, is the predominate stratum ; but altogether it contains a much smaller admixture of clay and marl than the prevailing strata to the west, so that it does not perhaps wear away quite so rapidly, and there are no fallen masses of any dimen sions along the bottom of the cliffs. Neither of the shores now mentioned have much of beauty in them. On the other hand they are rather dull and monotonous ; and though the chines which have been formed by the small streams, are accounted objects of interest, the interest which they possess is not of a very high order. The situation of the valley of Shanklin is very fine, its sea views are extensive, and its sea air is fresh and healthy ; but its chine, which is usually considered as the lion of the place, is upon the whole rather a dull and dingy concern. The stratum in which it is worked is uniformly dark in its colour ; and, though it does not waste away very fast by the trickling of the little rill, or the action of the weather, it has not that expression of permanence about it, which one finds in"], [119, "95 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. whatever deserves the name of rock. It is 60 soft indeed, that it forms a soil for the roots of plants, and altogether it is a wonder which is soon forgotten. Luccomb, though small as a chine, has upon the whole a more interesting character. It is more as nature made it ; and the operations of nature are upon the whole upon a grander scale, \u2014 there is some thing more impressing about it ; and, comparing even the chines, we would feel disposed at once to say that more na tural power, whatever that power may have been, has been expended in the forming of Luccomb than of Shanklin. Luccomb chine, though not actually part and parcel of the Under-cliff, is in close juxta-position with its eastern extre mity ; and the amphitheatre, which terminates in the chine, is more perfect in its formation. It has Boniface down on the south and south-west, and Shanklin down, with its prolongation towards Dunnose, on the north-west and north ; whereas the ground in the direction of Shanklin subsides into the sandy surface, extending northward to the eastern Yar. Altogether, this portion of the line of coast is of a mixed character ; it has none of the quiet and permanent beauty of the north side of the Island, and it mingles a few of the characters of the Under-cliff, of which we are about to speak, with those of the land, under the chalk downs of the south-west. If, however, the Island had nothing more to show than this, its scenery would tempt but few visitors ; for the same general character may be found on the coast of the New Forest, without the Needles, or any other part of England, where the sea is invading cliffs which are of ten der structure, and yet not prone to imbibe water and slide toward the beach in mass. The remaining portion of the coast, from near Luccomb to Black-gang chine, which may be estimated at about seven miles in length, but which rarely equals, and never exceeds, half-a-mile in breadth, is the characteristic part of the Island, \u2014 the part which it is so difficult to describe, be cause there is nothing in the British Islands bearing much resemblance to it. The eastern downs give no indication"], [120, "96 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. which would lead one to expect anything of the sort, even at places where the lower parts of them are broken into in the most fantastic shapes ; and there is only one portion of the other downs of the south part of the Island which gives a slight indication of this. This is the edge of a mass of rock, which stands out on the brow of the hill to the north- west of Appuldurcomb park, and not above a mile from the village of Godshill. To one who has been accustomed to see hills, in which the strata have been broken by dykes of basalt, or other volcanic matters, pressed upwards through a fissure, this indication of disrupted rock would be very na- turally mistaken for one of these. Upon reaching it, how- ever, one finds that it has a very different structure, and in its formation it is a stratum of sand, strongly but irregularly indurated by a mixture of iron. It belongs to the forma- tion under the chalk ; but, except where it has been broken at the sides, its position does not appear to have been dis- turbed when the surface of the Island received its present form. The general line of its northern boundary cannot be traced; but, oft the south, it presents itself, with a few in- terruptions, nearly the whole way from St. Catherine's, to Chine-head in the east. One interruption occurs at Niton, near where the eastern Yar has its source, another near St. Lawrence, and a third toward Ventnor, where the downs descend, in rounded masses, to an elevated portion of the Under-cliff; below which, however the general level of the surface is very much disturbed, though perhaps not quite so much so as it is, both to the eastward and the westward. Whenever this stratum appears, the position of it, whether from east to west, or from north to south, seems to be almost level : it it everywhere remarkably honey-combed and rug- ged, in original fractures, and by the action of the weather; and when the strata under it have much consistency, it often stands out in beetling points, of ragged and truly formidable appearance \u2014 nor can any one, who examines it with the slightest attention, fail to perceive that the irregular sur face between this singular precipice and the sea, has been"], [121, "97 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. formed by successive fractures of the precipice, and jum bling of the constituent parts together \u2014 not by any violent convulsion of nature, but by ordinary causes, which are even now at work; and of the operation of which there have been striking examples, within the memory of many per sons now living. When this demolition, and formation of new and peculiar land, first began, no one can possibly ascertain ; but, toward the middle part of the cliff, it is not probable that very much has occurred within the period recorded in history, though, even here, small angular fragments are detached, from time to time, but without any slip or change in the bed or posi tion of the general strata. It should seem, indeed, that this tendency of the land to slip, contributes both to the beauty and the permanence of the district ; for, Avhen the surface descends to 200 or 300 feet lower than it was before, and has the sweep of the wind over it broken by the lofty cliff from which it has parted, the climate must be greatly ameliorated. It must be this, to an extent which one would not, at first sight, be very apt to suppose ; for, in such a si tuation as the south side of the Isle of Wight, a moderate difference of level produces a great variation of climate. It does this, not only by lessening the fury and effect of the sea wind, but by very materially diminishing the quan tity of rain that falls, and the consequent evaporation and production of cold. We are not aware that rain-guages, or hygrometers, have ever been used contemporaneously on the Under-cliff and the high downs, such as St. Catherine's and Boniface ; but the analogy of other places would lead one to consider that, though the summit of the down may not be a mile in horizontal distance from the Under-cliff, yet, that the quantity which falls on the down in the course of the year may be double that which falls on the Under cliff, or even more. By observations, made on the summit and near the bottom of Kinnoul hill in the vicinity of Perth, by Professor Anderson, it was found that, in some years, the quantity of rain shown by the hill-gauge was o"], [122, "98 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. more than double that shown by the one 20 feet above the level of the river Tay. The difference between the top of the high downs, at the back of the Isle of Wight, and the Under-cliff, if carefully taken, would perhaps be found great er than this, because the wind comes more directly from the sea, and beats with greater violence, in the one situation than in the other. Even where the land above the cliff is not so high as to be unfit for tillage, as in the portion between Niton and St. Lawrence \u2014 which begins to slope northward almost immediately at the top of the precipice, and which appears to be excellent land, the difference of effect during a rainy season contrasts very strongly with the Under-cliff. In the present year (1839), remark able for the quantity of its rain, the crops on the high grounds were standing on the ground, the barley blackened, and the wheat with scarely any substance in the grain, at the same time that every sheaf was removed from the fields, and carefully stored, on the Under-cliff, at the distance of not more than half-a-mile. Even in travelling along the Under-cliff itself, one can easily see the remarkable difference which small changes of height, and considerable ones of exposure, have upon all the productions of the earth, if one except lichens \u2014 which always grow most freely in cold and damp atmospheres. In the course of slight inequalities, which are apparently owing to the varied degrees of violence with which the land-slips have been produced, one invariably finds the western slopes, Avhich are turned toward the blasts of the sea wind, stunted in their vegetation, as compared with those which incline in the opposite direction. One may observe also, that the large masses of fallen stone which spot the Under-cliff \u2014 in a manner often the most grotesque, are not without their use in the economy of its vegetation ; and so strikingly do the little patches among the great stones contrast with the more open places, that one is dis posed to believe that, though all these rocks could be removed, and the places which they occupy added to the cultivable"], [123, ""], [124, "._/ Msoe/sJt III.

Ill, ',./,,,/ I,, ,;., I;.;,,,,-/., ,.. \u2022 ... . , ,,,,,, . il I."], [125, "99 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. surface, the real productions of that surface would be dimi nished rather than increased. Agriculturists have often found to their cost how dangerous it is to remove the comparatively small pebbles from exposed fields, especially from fields exposed to sea air ; and there is very little doubt that the advantage of the sheltering stones on the Under-cliff is much greater, to say nothing of the very striking diversity which they give to the countless landscapes, almost all of one class, and yet no two of exactly the same character, which occur in this strikingly peculiar district. We have stated that, though unknown, the commencement of the land-slips, which have gradually formed this Under cliff, appears to have been very remote ; and we may add that, for the .the greater part of the length, no change of any consequence has occurred in the central parts of the district. From the south-eastern shoulder of St. Catherine's to about Ventnor, and thence eastward to near Bonchurch, but more especially along the former of these distances, the exposure of cliff and formation of Under-cliff appear to have been com pleted for many years. Along this line, no rills of water trickle down the faces of the cliffs, or escape from their fissures at any considerable height above the proximate Under-cliff; and thus, the cliffs have advanced so far inland as to be exposed to no disintegrating influence, save that of the weather, upon their surfaces, which, how strongly soever it may beat, has never of its own unaided influence any ten dency to produce a land-slip. But toward both the western and the eastern extremities of the Under-cliff, surface rills and springs, many of the latter impregnated with mineral ingredients, \u2014 especially toward the western termination, appear at much greater elevations, and in strata which are of more tender quality, and more absorbent of moisture. This is especially the case for some distance along the great chasm of Black-gang chine, which, large as it is, is the pro duction of a very insignificant rill of water. Even now, the upper part of that chasm, especially on the left or eastern bank, appears to be absorbing water very fast, so that il o2"], [126, "100 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. will require only a summer and autumn of more than wonted rain, and an early winter of more than usual frost, to send it thundering down the chasm, when that frost gives way, so as completely to alter the character of the chine ; and, in all probability, to extend the Under-cliff westward to where the abrupt slope now comes immediately doAvn to the line of the beach. Whether this may happen in a few years or in many, is a point which no 'one can decide ; but that it will take place, sooner or later, is very apparent, both from the form of the cliffs, and from the texture of the materials composing them. The strata of clay and marl, composing great part of the height of this cliff, are of a very plastic nature ; and they alternate with beds of firm stone which, though they answer well for common building purposes, would be too weak for supporting the matters over them, or even them selves alone, if much of the clay and marl were softened into sludgy mortar. There are also numerous springs of water coming out near the bottoms, where the basin receiving the rill of the chine is at present situated ; and in consequence of this trickling out of water, the basin is enlarging, and undermining the parts above, by successive exfoliations from all the sides. Those stony beds too, are full of vertical cutters, which admit water, and are liable to disruption in case of that water freezing ; and, in short, in whatever way we view it, there are indications of approaching ruin about this part of the cliff, which as it beetles upward a great deal to the eastward of the chine, would, if once set in motion, pro bably occasion one of the greatest land-slips that ever occur red in this part of the Island. Nor are we confined to analogy alone, in reasoning about the probability of a land-slip here ; for, just immediately to the eastward, abutting upon, and in fact forming a part of, the cliff of which we are now speaking, there was an exten sive land-slip 40 years ago, in 1799. Previous to that time, the materials now forming the surface of this land-slip, and extending to the water's edge, just where the reef of Rocken end, that is, \" the end of the rocks,\" stretches outward into"], [127, "101 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. the Channel ; and, in all probability, shows the direction of a southern spur of St. Catherine's down, which has long since been demolished, and scattered over the bed of the ocean, to prepare a stratum of new land, against the time when the earth shall undergo another of those alterations of surface, ofwhich the evidences are so numerous in almost every part of the world. It will be recollected that the last years of the eigh teenth century were more than usually rainy, and tended to produce a scarcity approaching to famine in various parts of the country; and the disruption occasioned by the severe frosts in the early part of 1799, loosened from its mooring to Gore cliff under St. Catherine's hill, the entire farm of Pit lands, consisting of about 100 acres. The precise area of the farm is not, we believe, generally known ; and it cannot now be compared with that of the new land which has been formed, and which, from its plastic nature, and the force with which it descended, probably covers more surface now than it originally occupied. The soil here was plastic marl, abounding in large masses of rock, and with an accumulation of water within its substance. The heavy rains of the autumn had forced this into the ground in more than usual quantity ; and, when the frost had expanded it in the ground, it was covered by a mass of snow and ice, immediately under the shoulder of the down. The fall was not violent, for it conti nued during the 7th and 8th days of February ; and the farm performed its journey to its new locality with but little noise or injury, excepting in so far as the surface was altered, \u2014 and this may be an advantage. The surface of course gave way, and the large stones, clumps of bushes, trees, and soft sludgy matter, did not all move at the same rate, although there was no very great or general overturning, such as would be likely to ensue if the eastern side of the gorge of Black-gang were to give way. The surface was however greatly disturbed ; for it had got a ploughing such as farm never got from mortal man. Fortunately, there was no house upon the farm, excepting a small cottage, fitted up as a place of occasional resort. This cottage sunk into the"], [128, "102 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. moving materials, with the exception of the chimneys ; and of course whatever articles were contained in it were destroy ed ; and a few apple and other trees, which were on some parts of the farm were placed in new situations, and singular positions. The cottage had been \"founded on a rock;\" which shows that a rock is not the very safest of all founda tions, unless one happens to know what the rock itself is founded upon, and so on downwards, nearly to the level of the sea, or at all events, to that of the nearest plain or bed of a lake, \u2014 into which latter, disrupted lands, produced by the ordinary action of the weather, have been precipitated, and occasioned direful calamities, in the Alps and other places. The reports of this casualty, drawn up we believe at the time, and by those who were eye-witnesses on the spot, mention, that a gentleman connected with the Treasury had actually contracted with a builder, to erect him a house of the cost of \u00a3 5,000, upon the very spot where the cottage stood; but some derangement in that gentleman's affairs, occurred in the meantime, and saved him the loss of a house, besides, in all probability, the lives of a whole establishment ; for though the motion of the farm was slow, the attempt to escape over moving sludge, and amid vast masses of stone, creeping along however slowly, is a matter of great peril, if not impossibility. For a human being to have the ground unstable under foot, in consequence of a lateral motion, is a condition to which no one is accustomed ; and consequently, the centre of gravity would be unmanageable, presence of mind would be lost, and the party attempting to escape would only add his body to the moving ruin. Immediately upon the occurrence of this catastrophe, the surface was of course one mass of confusion, \u2014 all the com ponent parts being jumbled together in a chaotic manner, from which they will never completely recover; nor is this tract even now so verdant as the older parts of the Under cliff. The subsidence does not appear to have been quite so great as in situations farther to the eastward ; and, as there are still large stones, and sludgy earth, and rills of water,"], [129, "103 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. blended together in various places, it is not impossible that some parts of this disturbed surface may move a second time. One change for the better has unquestionably happened; for the district has descended to a better climate, which may in time make it more valuable than it was before, just as is the case with other parts of the Under-cliff. The fate of this however ought to give some warning to those who are erect ing villas between this land-slip and the chine ; for, though these may be founded immediately on the rock, and that rock may have the appearance of stability, appearances in such a place are not to be depended on ; and it is very possible that the leveling of a flat area for a villa and its patch of lawn, may tend to admit the water in the vertical fissures and cutters of the rock, and thus hasten some such catastrophe as that to which we are alluding. It is worthy of remark, as showing how prone people are to ascribe uncommon events to strange and special causes, and not to those uniform laws which govern the common economy of nature, and bring about all its phenomena, that the simple fact of this piece of sludgy ground sliding down in consequence of being softened by the rain and severed by the frost, was attributed to earthquakes, and to various other causes ; and, that it was made to kill two soldiers who had unfortunately fallen over the cliffs during a dark night \u2014 a full month before the farm of Pitlands began its journey. If the people, who thus needlessly conjured the greater powers of nature, had taken the trouble of exa mining the rest of the Under-cliff, they would have at once perceived that, not only was no earthquake necessary for bringing about this catastrophe, but that no earthquake could have done it. If an earthquake had lasted for two whole days, not a stone of one building in the Island would have been left upon another, and all the inpending rocks, with which the Under-cliff so much abounds, would have been shaken together as dust; and, in all probability, swept away by the violence of the sea, which would roll in in one wave more than mid-cliff high, if its vicinity were shaken"], [130, "104 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. by an earthquake even of half as many minutes duration as the descent of this piece of land required hours. The smaller, but more recent land-slip, which occurred near Bonchurch at the eastern extremity of the Under-cliff, some ten years after the one now mentioned, is a further proof that little more has now to be dreaded in this part of the Island except trifling advances at the two extremities ; and from the nature of the soil these cannot range to any considerable distance. We may further notice, while treat ing of the obvious method in which the Under-cliff has been formed, that as one approaches the western extremity, one passes more into sludgy clay and marl, strongly impreg nated within ; and often containing very rich masses of sulphate of iron, which are strewed along the beach in Chale bay aud further to the west. All the water which passes through any depth of the soil toward these western parts is more or less tinged with iron, and occasionally with alkaline salts, and other ingredients. Some of these springs have had powerful medicinal virtues ascribed to them ; and it is possible that good may have followed to some patients, especially dispeptic ones, after, though perhaps not in consequence of, drinking the waters. If water has a disagreeable taste, and especially if is contains as much air of any kind as makes it sparkle, people who feel diseased, and yet know not very well what is the matter with them, are apt to fancy that they derive relief from the drink ing of this water; and as \" Credat ut habes, et habes\" is far more true in the case of such patients than it was in that of the Catholic whom Erasmus recommended to borrow a horse by faith alone, the imaginary remedy affords relief from the imaginary disease. There is one real advantage of springs of this kind, independently of all virtue, real or imaginary, which may be in the water, that makes them entitled to some consideration; and this is the fact that mineral springs are very generally situated in places Avhere the enjoying of them requires a good deal of bodily exercise ; the performance of which is, in itself, healthful"], [131, "105 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. When we proceed farther to the eastward, where the water comes out from under or near the chalk, or is filtered through the sand and gravel of the downs, it is of more pure and sparkling quality; and this is the character of the water to the eastward of the pass across the cliffs near St Law rence; but it again changes a little before Shanklin is arrived at, because, there again, the strata begin to be tinged by a considerable admixture of iron. There are no rivulets of any consequence in a country so narrow as this Under-cliff; but some of the springs which flow from under the cliff are pretty copious; and, as their sources are in general deep seated, they are perennial in their supply, and the water is delightfully cooling in the summer. This coolness of the water is intimately connected with the stability of that line of cliffs from which the Under-cliff is broken away. In the central part of the district, the surface-water begins to run northward, at a short distance behind the crown of the cliffs; and even at St Catherine's, the rill which de scends Black-gang chine is, except during floods, and then its water very speedily runs off, much smaller than that remotest feeder of the eastern Yar, which the same down discharges behind Niton. All the springs below the cliffs, where these have been disrupted by land-slips, are of the nature of drainages, by means of which the cliffs are kept dry, and consequently are more durable than if they were not exposed; while these filtered streamlets are quite pro portional to the extent of a country less than half-a-mile in breadth. Most of them are beautiful, and some expand into very pretty sheets of ornamental water, while the one at Ventnor, by the aid of a pond, suffices to turn a mill. One at St. Lawrence is made to issue from a dolphin's head, in the back part of a very tasteful artificial fountain, from which it falls into a shell basin, out of which it sparkles with pleasing coolness ; and altogether forms a most appro priate ornament, in a part of the Under-cliff which in every respect is exceedingly pretty. It is true that, with the ex ception of the cliff from which they have parted, all the p"], [132, "106 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. parts and features of the Under-cliff are on a very minute scale ; but then this harmonises well with the country, across whose greatest breadth a tolerably good eye can read an ordi nary sign-post ; though it is seldom that the whole distance across can be seen, except in the case of a flag-staff, a more than usually large rock, or a dwelling founded upon a high cliff on the shore. With few exceptions, the larger and stronger masses of stone appear to have traveled the farthest at the time of the slips, and to have mingled with other masses of rock, which are either the results of former disintegration, or earth-fast, and part of the strata under the low-water mark. The most remarkable rocks of this kind are those already alluded to as extending outwards into the Channel, just at the angle where the coast be gins to trend north-westward into the bays of Chale and Brixton. These rocks are. very dangerous, for there are many of them just hidden by the water, and the current of high-water sets with considerable impetus through them. This violence is increased by the narrow passage through the Needles, and the form of the coast from thence to this point. Both circumstances combine in raising a confluent high-water off Rocken-end, as the current from the bays westward sets obliquely against the main current in mid channel. This confluence, however, tends to force the strength of the current farther off the shore of the Under cliff than it would othenvise be ; and the consequence is, that there is some slight approach to an eddy in the little coves which break the line of the Under-cliff shores. The chief of these coves are, Puckaster immediately under the road from Niton, and Steep-hill opposite the road which descends there from the downs between the Under-cliff and Appuldurcomb. Besides these, there are numerous little open ings among the rocks, where a small boat may put to sea, or land, in fine weather ; but, if the weather is in any degree stormy, the surf rolls heavily on those little beaches, and the boats must be hauled above the tide-way, otherwise they would be stove in. Yet still, though not a coast at all adapt-"], [133, "107 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. for the resort of shipping of any description, except very little craft in fine weather for pleasuring purposes, the fallen rocks along the whole line of the Under-cliff present a more permanent barrier to the sea than any of the strata in situ, upon the exposed coast of the Island. The advance of Rocken-end into the water, and the confluence of tide alluded to, have some share in the production of this. But still, the comparative lowness of the shore, and the em- battling by the strong masses of fallen rock, together with the low and broken character of the line, are the chief cir- cumstances which produce this effect, and which, at the same time, conduce to the shelter of the land between them and the high cliff. The remarkably varied character of the surface of the Under-cliff, with the exception of a portion about Ventnor, holds the wind in passing over the surface, and thus makes it much less violent, not only on the ground and its productions, but upon the face of the cliff, than it otherwise would be. When trees are on the exposed side of the large masses of stone, they are very much stunted, and bent in a north-easterly direction ; but, on the shel- tered sides, they grow luxuriantly, though when the tops rise higher than the shelter, they not only lose their leaves early in the season, but are very apt to wither, while the lower and sheltered branches continue to grow vigorously. Fruit-trees thrive well, unless they are in exposed places ; and ivy is luxuriant upon the boles of the trees, the walls of some of the houses, and various portions of the cliff. The most remarkable character of the cliff is the ragged and honey-combed appearance of the hard strata of ferruginous sand-stone near the summit, which often sticks out in the form of immense boards projecting many feet into the air. When the slipped land has broken away from the bottom, or at least low down in the cliffs, the under part consists very much of free-stone, containing a considerable proportion of lime, with ammonites, and other shells of the olden time, in considerable numbers ; and these shells, generally speak ing, obey the usual law of this description of fossils, in being p2"], [134, "108 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. much larger than the analogous species which are now found in the living state. Towards the eastern termination at Luc- comb, the hard stratum appears to be wanting, or at all events it does not present so bold an appearance as it does in the most westerly parts of the cliff. Here also, the calcareous sand-stone, in thick beds, and abounding with shells, appears to rise higher above the level of the sea than it does to the westward; but, toward Shanklin, it passes into the same description of strata as about Black-gang, only clay is less, and sand more, abundant: \u2014 and the passage toward the chalk in the east is through a series of sandy formations, while in the west it is more through clays and marls. Off the Under-cliff generally, the water is of no great depth, until some distance from the land is reached ; but in turning round Dunnose the case is different, \u2014 the water being very deep there within a short distance of the shore, though the line of the shore itself is very much broken by huge fragments of rock. The cause of the deeper water at this particular part of the coast seems, in a great measure at least, to be produced by the indraught of the flood-tide, which sets here tow7ard Portsmouth, and forms one of the double tides in the narrow seas, \u2014 the other being formed by the current from the west through the Needles ; and the interval between the two high-waters varying a good deal with the general state of the tide and the weather. It is this tide round Dunnose which, sweep- ing round the curve of Sandown bay, and forming a con fluence with the more seaward portion which moves faster, is gradually wearing away Culver cliff, and White-cliff bay immediately to the north. The point of the latter gives a new direction to the current, so that it sets more to the north-east, and leaves the water more easy in St. Helen's and Spithead anchorages. It is, as we have said, the strong run of this tidal current round Dunnose which has proba bly scooped the bottom to a greater depth there than it has to the north,\u2014 just as we find a deeper channel in that part of the Solent, where it is narrowed by the projection of"], [135, "109 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. Hurst castle, than it is in the wider part within. There do not appear to be double tides any where on the back of the Island ; but the wave of high-water \" broaches right in shore\" in Brixton and Chale bays, and advances more \" end on\" toward Dunnose; where, notwithstanding the small en tanglements of the irregular line of coast, it advances more rapidly round the shore than in the bays westward. The tides on this coast have not however been examined with much minuteness ; and, as it is not a tidal coast for any of the common purposes of navigation, the motive to a strict examination of its tides is neither very palpable nor very strong. While noticing the line of the shore, and the general motion of the high-water upon it, we may mention that a light-house is in progress to its completion upon the beach near Rocken-end, which it is expected, reasonably we think, will render this coast considerably more safe than it has hitherto been. The former plan was, as we previously hinted, to erect those light-houses on the highest parts of the downs ; as for example on St. Christopher's, the highest point above the Needles, 615 feet above the level of the sea ; and on St. Catherine's, which is 750 feet high, more inland; and could be useful only in keeping vessels clear of the back of the Island. The lighthouse near the Needles is chiefly of service to vessels which take their passage by the Solent ; and, as it is near the passage, and not quite so high as St. Catherine's, it is better seen than the light which was erected there. The last was found to be of no service ; because in bad weather the top of this high down is generally so enveloped in clouds or thick fogs, that a light upon it is not visible at any safe distance seaward. With the new light-house, when completed, the case will, it is hoped, be different ; the low part of the shore is known to be quite clear, when the upper part is hidden by clouds and vapours ; and, therefore, it is highly probable that the light here will be an efficient means of safety ; because, in most states of the weather, a vessel will be able to gee it,"], [136, "110 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. before she is in the slightest danger from the reef at Rocken end \u2014 to say nothing of the fatal bays to the westward, which may also be avoided by careful observation of this light. Why there was not a light-house here at an earlier time is a question upon the discussion of which we need not enter, though it might probably have been the means of saving much property and many valuable lives ; but, it is never too late to erect a work which has so great and va luable a national purpose in view. There is one thing to be said \u2014 though this Under-cliff especially, and the whole back of the Isle of Wight ge nerally, have so many natural charms as a locality, and so many dangers to the mariner, it has been very much a neg lected coast until comparatively late years. As long as it was the constant resort of smugglers, and the theatre of all the misery and vice which smuggling occasions, it was a place of comparatively little resort, and visited by few except for a short time during the summer. Now, however, that smuggling has been put down \u2014 expensively no doubt, but still pretty effectively, and the people being compelled to re spect the revenue laws, have been led to more general respect for laws of every description, the moral and econo mical characters of the Under-cliff, and the rest of the line of shore of which it forms the principal ornament, have undergone a change much for the better. In consequence of this, the value both of property and of labour, has been probably more than doubled since the close of the late war ; and it is delightful to see handsome villas, and thriving villages, springing up, in increasing numbers every year, in the very situations which, so short a time ago, were abandoned as the dens of demoralized and wretched smug glers for the greater part of the year. Notwithstanding the cliff, which apparently cuts off its whole length from the rest of the Island, the access to the Under-cliff is very easy from all the other parts ; for every one of those roads which lead over high portions of the downs, are formed of good materials, though hilly ; and, not-"], [137, "111 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. withstanding that this side of the Island neither has, nor can have, any port of its own for the ingress of sea-borne com modities, yet its distance, either from Cowes, the interme diate port to Southampton ; or from Ryde, which stands in the same relation to Portsmouth, is not very great, \u2014 notnearly so great, or so difficult to be passed over, as the roads from the same ports to the inland towns in the central parts of the main-land of Hampshire. It is no doubt a little pro voking to have the open expanse of the sea continually be fore one's eyes, without being able to avail ones' self of it, as the best and cheapest of all paths of transit ; but still, as compared with the average of their countrymen, the dwellers at the back of the Island have little to complain of in re spect of sea-carriage ; and they have the beauty, and much of the majesty, of the sea, without money and without price. Even in respect of fish, the Channel must be regarded as comparatively a barren sea ; for there is no harbour for any of the more valuable fishes ; and no safety for boats going off to any distance. The whole shore is rocky, however, and thus it affords excellent shelter and abundant food for crabs and lobsters, which are taken in great numbers ; and for the most part, we believe, sent to the London market. Rocky shores, where the water races speedily by, are the favourite abodes of these Crustacea, \u2014 especially of the lob ster, which is organised for darting through the water with great certainty and force, so as to secure its prey even in a rapid current. The pedunculated eyes of the Crustacea also give them much more ready command of the water than the eyes of fishes, which, for the most part, are flat and immoveably set in the head. The capture of crabs and lobsters is, however, one of the least profitable descriptions of fishing \u2014 if we can apply the term to animals which cer tainly have no title to the name of fishes ; and while they are out of season, those who capture them have no sea em ployment, \u2014 not even the laborious birding of the fishermen of the muddy shores of the main-land, of which some ac count will be found in the second volume of this work."], [138, "112 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. As already noticed, various species of such sea-birds as are rock-breeders, resort to the high cliffs about the Needles and Culver during their nesting time ; but even these have not their feeding grounds at the back of the Island ; and, in the Island, there is little or no scope for such as breed in fens and marshes. Therefore, scarcely any sea-birds fre quent the rocks between the Under-cliff and the downs, the principal winged inhabitants of these being various species of land birds. Rock-doves abound in some parts of Culver cliff ; and it is said that the cliff gets its name from their presence ; but we believe there are few or none in any part of the Under-cliff. Jackdaws are the most abundant in habitants of these ; but we never observed any choughs. There are a few hawks, but they are not very numerous ; and there are, or used to be, one or two pairs of ravens. It has been said that peregrine falcons once inhabited here ; but they are rare birds, and we saw not a trace of them. Sparrow-hawks appear to be the most plentiful ; and there seem to be a few merlins, \u2014 and probably hobbies, and some of the smaller migrant hawks, may take up their summer abode here, as the sylvan tribes are very abundant, espe cially the blackbird and the thrush. Wild-ducks there are of course none ; and the beach is too thoroughly washed, and the pebbles too constantly in motion, for any of the swimming birds which frequent the shores, \u2014 excepting per haps in such places as Brading harbour, or part of SandoAvn bay ; and the latter especially must be but a bare pasture, from the continual lashing of the waves, and disintegration of the land. Along the sheltered part of the Under-cliff, the tempera ture of the seasons is mild ; though the winter storms often sweep along with great violence, and the sea rolls in moun tains upon the shores. Notwithstanding the reflection from the cliffs, the summer is seldom excessively warm ; because the fresh air from the sea is always ready to come in, when either the Under-cliff or the downs are greatly heated. In this part of the Island the downs are not so subject to be"], [139, "113 PECULIAR CHARACTERS. violently heated during the day and as rapidly cooled dur- ing the night, as they are when they have only a thin coating of verdure over the chalk. St. Catherine's and the downs immediately to the eastAvard have pretty copious ve- getation, and indeed admit of being cultivated almost to the very summits, because the soil is of a character which ab- sorbs heat during the day, and radiates it during the night. The downs toward Dunnose also have this character in ra- ther less perfection, although, with few exceptions, they also admit of being cultivated to the very summits ; and there are very tolerable crops, both of corn and of artificial grasses, very high upon Shanklin down, and the other downs around Appuldurcomb. This arises from the co- vering which is over the portion of chalk that exists there ; and the character of the chalk itself, which belongs to the lowest part of the formation, and is darker in the colour, and more mixed with siliceous matter than the upper strata of the same formation. Still, from the falls of rain to which they are subject, and the absence of trees, the sum- mits of those downs are more bleak than their southerly situation and their comparatively small height would lead one to suppose. If the autumn happens to be very rainy, the winter is generally very cold, and the snow and frost more severe than one would be apt to suppose ; though the vicinity of the sea generally prevents these winter storms from being of very long continuance ; and also mitigates, on the Under-cliff, those protracted contests between the departing winter and the coming spring, which are often so fatal to early vegetation, and more especially to the blossoms of fruit-trees, upon the main-land of the south of England, where the frost, from the high and naked land of chalk, is often apt to come down and blast the hopes of the cultivator in the course of a single night. In sheltered spots here, the sea air is almost the only enemy of cultivat ed vegetation, whether of herbs or of trees.

CHAPTER V. SEA-TRIP ROUND THE ISLAND. As every description of the Isle of Wight, whether more passive or more permanent in its character, must have refe rence to strangers visiting that Island, it becomes necessary to introduce a short account of the whole of its varied coasts, as viewed from the sea in the course of a circumnavigation ; and such a navigation, every visitor who wishes thoroughly to understand the Island ought to make, previous to any land-examination, or perambulation of the interior. As there are two main points of arrival on the shores, from either of which a circumnavigation may be begun, it will of course depend upon where the traveller makes his land ing, whether he shall take his departure for the sea-trip, from Ryde, or from Cowes. If he arrives from Portsmouth, Ryde will of course be the place at which to embark ; but if from Southampton, Cowes is preferable. The trip may be made either in a sailing boat or a steamer, \u2014 the former being preferable for such as are familar with the waters, and the latter to such as are not ; to ensure that complete command of either craft which is necessary for obtaining a perfect view of the whole Island from the sea, and from Q 2"], [142, "116 SEA-TRIP ROUND s}he beach, which is perhaps the best general view of all the most striking and characteristic parts of it, it is necessary to be one of a pretty numerous party, or to have controul of the craft in some way or other. The party is however the preferable way, and the more miscellaneous its compo sition is so much the better ; because then, an observant traveller has a study in his companions, at those particular parts of the coast where the Island itself affords little or none ; and not only this, for the observations of persons of different mind, education, habits, and nerve, furnish one with a lecture upon human nature, which is in itself as in teresting, if not more so, than that of any mere combina tion of scenery, however novel or peculiar it may be. Ryde is, in some respects, a place apart, \u2014 leading to New port, the centre of the Island, by only a common country road ; and by one which has nothing very striking or pecu liar to give it interest. So also, if the sailing or steaming craft is taken from Ryde, there is a long stretch of simple though beautiful coast to be passed along before one can arrive at any of those facades of the land, which let one know that one is coasting the Isle of Wight. Cowes is therefore the preferable starting point ; and as, after the completion of the South-western Railway, it can be reached in shorter time, it is every way the more eligible. Suppose then we start from Cowes ; that we have the prospect of a fine and invariable day, with just as much wind as shall give a little life to the water, without boding death or disagreeable sensations to even the most squeamish of the cargo ; and that the tide is setting westward through the Solent. If a steamer is the craft, the light wind, just enough to give life and air to the waters, may blow from what point it lists without much detriment ; and we should say, that upon the whole, the west-south-west, which is the prevailing wind, and may be had more steadily than any other, is the best, even with a sailing craft ; and the tide setting westward with some velocity, a gentle tiff of this wind will not require that the passage of the Solent should"], [143, ". s r CO WES , TROM NEWPORT ROAD if,,.,/,.:./,, ..71,1.1,.. \u25a0/,\u201e!

In such weather as we should recommend, \u2014 and it had better be a week or two in advance of the equinoctial gales, the steamer can hold on her way with perfect indifference, using or not using the supplemental sail as circumstances may require. Whatever the craft is, there should be a landing boat of small draught of water, and yet of suffici ent breadth of beam and strength not to be easily upset otherwise injured, in case of a little tumbling water in shore ; and furthermore, there should be some one who knows in what states of the tide the different landings, which are essential to the perfection of the trip, may be made with perfect safety, and to the greatest advantage. This, we believe, is generally the case ; because during the season so many persons circumnavigate the Island, that al most every one connected with the craft is quite adequate to act as pilot and guide in these matters ; and also as cicerone, \u2014 in which latter capacity howeATer, those who really wish to enjoy the coasts of the Island had better dispense with his services, and see and judge for themselves. Well, suppose all these preliminaries and preparations are suited to one's satisfaction \u2014 that one has quitted the pier at Cowes and got down as far as Egypt ; the aspect here is rather beautiful, as many of the houses are well and ap propriately built, and rise one above another embowered among trees. Just when Egypt is passed, which is nearly a mile from the place of embarkation, the rocks at the north-east end of Gurnet bay make their appearance, and continue, for about half-a-mile, not very striking in their character, but still forming a contrast with any shore which"], [146, "118 SEA-TRIP ROUND has been seen since embarking at Southampton. The inbend of Gurnet bay occupies an interruption of some half-a-mile in the rocks, and they again continue for some three-quarters of a mile to the dingy flat of Thorney bay, which extends all the way to the Newhaven river. Some strata of the rocks at Gurnet bay furnish building-stone of sound and durable quality ; which is easily obtained from the quarry, near sea-carriage, and therefore of considerable value in all places within the narrow seas. From these rocks a ledge runs outward to some considerable distance ; and it is supposed, by those who have faith in such a junction, to have been the place where the Island was once joined to the main-land ; but the channel has not less than its average depth here, and at half-a-mile off the point the depth is greater than in most places of the same sea. \u2022 This part of the shore of the Island is by no means interesting ; but, in passing the entrance of the Newtown water, a pass ing glance inward is obtained as far as the central ridge of the downs. To the westward of Newtown river, there is a reef of rocks extending out into the sea, called the Ham stead ledge; and, as the depth of water is between two and three fathoms less here than off Gurnet point, this would be a more eligible situation for the imaginary con nection of the Island with the New Forest, \u2014 only it does not agree so well with a mark on the ground, which has been considered a Roman road leading from the New Forest to the central and southern parts of the Island ; but which is in reality no such thing. Proceeding onward, the shore is of the same dull and uninteresting character all the way to Yarmouth, which, as the crow flies \u2014 or, rather as the dolphin swims, is about nine miles from Egypt, which we have considered as the point of our \" departure.\" Yarmouth, with its old castle, does not make a very interesting ap pearance as viewed from the sea ; nor is there as yet any subject along the coast to impress one very much with the beauties or the peculiarities of the Isle of Wight.

About a mile onward, that is off Worsley's tower, immediately opposite Hurst castle, where the breadth is ex actly a mile, the Needles make their appearance ; but as, from a craft in-shore, nothing else is seen, they have the cold appearance of small ice-bergs. At this particular point, if the tide is setting eastward, there is a rush of water, and a tumbling sea, with a depth in mid-channel of double what it is in any other part of the narrow seas from hence to St. Helen's. As a vessel stemming the tide, be gins to dance a little here, to the no small annoyance of fresh-water sailors, the men of the sea call it \" the fiddler's race ;\" but though a merry passage, it is only a short one ; and the cliffs of Colwell and Tolland's bays, with their dingy masses of uninteresting sand and sand-stone, together with their ledges of projecting rocks, give less promise than even any of the tame and low shore which has been previously coasted. Headen hill has indeed some conside rable elevation, and its outline is tolerably good ; but there is a tenderness in the rocks, and a barrenness in their sur face, which greatly reduce the interest of its appearance. Upon doubling Hatherwood point, the southern extremity of this bay, near the pits whence the pure white sand is obtained, a new and a very different scene presents itself. This is Alum bay, which has nothing about it to break the interest of cliff, and sea, and sky. Along the south, and ranging nearly on a straight line for about three-quarters of a mile in length, there is one continuous precipice of chalk, apparently from 300 to 400 feet in height, sur mounted by a down of extreme steepness, and covered by very stunted herbage, upon which some straggling sheep are generally browsing. Those who land, and go to the summit of the down, where the light-house and beacon are,"], [150, "118 SEA-TRIP ROUND and which is quite safe and affords fine prospects, had better not ascend the down by Alum bay, directly for the light house ; for one part is most deceivingly steep, and one's shoes get so glazed, in a hot and dry day, that there is great jeopardy of slipping ; and if that is the case, the only stoppage is among the masses of chalk, and the turmoiling water at the bottom of the precipice, after a fall of the vast depth which has been named. Viewed from the sea, this, like all chalky precipices, is in itself cold and dull, and nothing but its ex tent* can render it tolerable ; and then there is the visible danger of toppling headlong to destruction, if any one should approach the top of it upon the shelving turf; if, however, one turns one's view to the eastward, the varied forms and tints of the strata in the formation over the chalk, make ample amends for the cold uniformity of the chalk itself. If we except bright red, and its complemental colour bright green, there is scarcely a tint of the decomposed solar beam which does not make its appearance here, together with in numerable compound ones, which nothing but nature itself can produce. Then, according to the consistency of the strata, and the action of the waves upon them, which rush upwards in some places to the very top, and leave their foam there, the facade of this part of the bay presents the most extraordinary shapes ; and the lines, and points, and pyramids, and cavities, which advance and recede in innumerable ways, produce a blending of direct and reflected lights, which no pen can describe, and no pencil imitate If form and colour are the objects sought after, this side of Alum bay is quite unrivalled, \u2014 not in the Isle* of Wight merely, but along the whole British shores ; and, in addition to this, it affords a rich and readily enjoyable treat to the geologist, to which we have made some allusion in a former chapter. It is as well to stop at the hotel here, which is pleasantly situated close by a beach, upon which, though the voice of the sea, shift ing through all tones and keys, from thunder to the softest murmur, is never silent ; and this is the proper place to wait the state of the tide, for seeing the marvels of the"], [151, "119 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. western chalk cliffs with as much ease and expedition as possible. Having again got under weigh, the Needles are to be passed ; and the most pleasant, as well as the safest, passage is fairly to double the most seaward one, after which half-a mile eastward will reach Scratchall's bay, in which there is a cavernous hole in the chalk, which may be entered with safety, tide and weather serving ; and which, with the view from it toward the Needles, comes as near to the picturesque, and even the sublime, as it is possible for anything to do, the substantial elements of which are chalk and water. If indeed the sea-birds are in motion, and the position of the light is favourable, so as to give effect to the shadows, and bring out. the few tints produced by samphire, scrithmum maritimumj the obtaining of which is one of the perils of such cliffs, one can feel, or at all events fancy, that there is beauty here, as well as singularity. Quitting Scratchall's bay, and doubling Sun corner, which is its southern ter mination, the cliffs of the Main Bench are skirted along. The water has worn them into various curves ; and large colum nar masses stand partially detached, as preparing for their fall into the water, some day or other ; but the prevailing impression here is that of a lofty chalk cliff in the progress of decomposition. About three miles from Sun corner, pass ing Main Bench and the Nodes, bring one opposite Freshwater gate, where there is a complete disruption, and a spring of fresh-water, the head of the western Yar, within a few yards of the beach. Some of the insulated rocks here are fantastic in their shapes ; and, though the surf beats strongly on the low shingly beach in rough weather, the aspect of things would lead one to conclude that there has been far more violent action at some former time. This is another con venient resting-place, if time will admit; and, if the tide is low enough, and the weather moderate, Freshwater cave may be entered without danger ; and in no place is the de struction of chalk rocks seen to greater perfection. The floor, the roof, and the sides, are all formed of huge and R"], [152, "120 SEA-TRIP ROUND shapeless fragments ; and in the places more remote from the entrance, the cold light upon the chalk really \" casts pale and dreadful.\" It is also apt to come across one's recol lection here, that a French prisoner, having escaped from the Scylla of his captive-house, took refuge in the Charybdis of this cave, or one near it, was confined by the water, and starved to death ; and this catastrophe gives a finishing touch to the horrors of the Freshwater caves. After leaving Freshwater and steering for Rocken-end, one has some leisure to meditate upon the marvels one has seen ; for there is very little of interest in the whole coast, from the termination of the chalk to the dark chasm of Black-gang chine. There is scarcely a place where a con venient or safe landing can be effected, even by means of the boat ; and if the set of the water is in-shore, a sailing craft or steamer must keep at some distance. Fortunately, however, there is nothing particularly worthy of being seen ; the cliffs along shore form a dingy raven-coloured line above the margin of the Avater, notched by a few trifling chines, with a country within it almost projected into a line from its flatness, and chalk downs of tame and sober outline in the distance. It is true that one may look backward in reminiscence to the western cliffs, and forward in antici pation to those at the commencement of which the lofty down of St. Catherine appears to stand sentinel ; and even when this down is at a considerable distance, it leads one to expect, though one knew nothing about it previously, a coast very different from that which one has been just exa mining. In the cliffs which have been observed, the chalk is undermost, and reaches quite down to the water's edge ; but in the profile of St. Catherine's, as seen along the whole passage, there is a verticle or overhanging breast of rock midway up the steep, with a capping of green down above, and a slope of more varied surface and colour below ; and this seems to say that we are to meet with something dif ferent, as bold naked cliffs of chalk are seldom seen ex cepting where they are produced by the immediate action of the sea."], [153, "TALE OF WIGHT \\n,./i,i A/* Pliij't y/t.ris ,'os //'it i'niprirtur Ju ' fu.i,t,mA CblUoi Street 8\\ D E <hh,n tu Tubhc library High.

If the weather is favourable, however, a landing may be made by the boat at Puckaster or Ventnor ; and if the sea, which ripples a good deal more off Rocken-end than off Hurst castle, should re quire a pause here, land renovation may be obtained. In sailing along, the beauties of the Under-cliff are in a great measure hidden ; and it has much the appearance of an irregular assemblage of lumps of rock, hummocks of earth, tufts of trees and shrubs, with a villa peeping out here and there, and a rough stone wall running along the whole north side, \u2014 as if to shut up the dwellers here as in a prison house between it and the sea. Amid this confusion, with the exception of the downs that rise over the whole, it is not very easy to discriminate one place from another ; and therefore it is fully as well for the passing stranger to be contented with the general impression, and return by land to work out the details, if his leisure will admit. When one begins to round the eastern extremities of the Under cliff, toward Bonchurch and Chine-head, a profile of the Island is again obtained ; and, as this is broken into suc cessive points, one receding behind the other, it is not the least pleasing sea-view of the whole. Immediately in ad vance is the bold promontory of Dunnose, strewed with rocky masses at the base ; beyond that is the chalky wall of Culver cliff, much diminished by the distance \u2014 though chalk always appears higher than it really is ; and, still beyond this, there is the Foreland, over which the vessels at anchor in St. Helen's road may often be seen. Doubling Dunnose, one has a view of the town and the wooded down of Shanklin ; with a prospect over all the country bordering Sandown bay, as far as the downs which extend from New r2"], [158, "124 SEA-TRIP ROUND port eastwards. The surface of these downs is in many places exceedingly bleak ; and the autumnal rains fall upon their summit in absolute pailfuls, to the great annoyance of any hapless pedestrian, who, if caught in one of those out pourings, can find no lodge in this wilderness. But the southern slopes of the downs, and the intermediate country, are rich ; and the light breakers upon Sandown beach make this side of the land- view appear as if it were hemmed in by a silver thread. Advancing eastward along the chord of Sandown bay, a view is obtained of the northern side of the South downs, the park and woods of Appuldurcomb, and the northern terraces of St. Catherine's, with the various mo numents, beacons, artificial ruins, and other erections on the heights. In rounding the Foreland, which may either be done within or without the Prince's shoal, off Bembridge ledge, a new scene opens, consisting of St. Helen's road in near view, Spithead beyond, with Portsmouth, Portsea and Hayling Islands, the intermediate harbours, and the high downs of Sussex, Portsdown, and the southern chalk hills of Hampshire, terminating the view ; while across Brading harbour, which seems a pleasant lake, or a puddle, according as the tide is high or low, the north-eastern edge of the central downs of the Island is seen, with the richly-wooded lands between them and the sea. From the termination of Sandown bay along the Foreland, to the entrance of Brading harbour, and again opposite St. Helen's, and at a few places to the north, there are rocks along the shore ; and along the whole line to Cowes a considerable extent of the banks is dry at low water ; but when the tide is in, craft of such ]ji|\u00bb4erate draft of water as an ordinary coasting steamer, can approach pretty near the shore ; the water being compara tively tranquil in almost every state of the weather, and no danger being to be apprehended. From its proximity to the main-land, and to the great naval establishment at Portsmouth, and the best anchorages in the Channel, the north-east coast of the Isle of Wight is beautiful and well-cultivated; and there are numerous"], [159, "125 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. well-built residences in very pleasant situations. It is to be understood that the sea-breeze here, or rather the land breeze which blows over the narrow sea, is fraught with no thing that can injure the most delicate vegetation ; and that thus, this part of the Island admits of being ornamented with wood down to the very high-water mark ; and it is possible that if any species of mangrove could be found capable of bearing the seasonal alternations of an English climate, plantations of it might be extended into this sea, and the banks converted into a sort of aquatic groves. But the mangrove family, ( Rhizophorace\u0153,) the only plants of a truly land type which can grow vigorously in salt-water, are all inhabitants of tropical climates ; and they advance into the beds of rivers, and even into the sea itself, by ex tending arches of roots through the air, the points of which reach the water ; and, in time, an entire forest of no mean extent is formed, the whole of it knit together as a single tree. In tropical countries, those mangrove forests are espe cially unhealthy ; and the apparent surface of land formed among them is eminently treacherous ; while, at the same time, they harbour aquatic serpents of the most deadly venom ; but still they protect the land, and even advance it into the water ; so that if any means could be discovered whereby they might be rendered capable of thriving in a temperate climate, there is no doubt that they would be highly valuable on all those shores where the sea is invad ing the land. From being near to the anchorage, St. Helen's has become a village of considerable importance ; and, though it has been moved a little inward of its older site, the re*\" mains of the church serve as a sea-mark ; and if this is taken in a line with the sea-mark on Ashy down, and Fort Monkton in a line with the church at Alverstoke near Gosport, a vessel is in the fairest way for St. Helen's roads, or for Spithead, according as the one or the other may be her destination. The priory, between St. Helen's and the sea, is a very pleasant residence, commanding a perfect"], [160, "126 SEA-TRIP ROUND view of the shipping in both roadsteads ; which is indeed a pleasure enjoyed from all the mansions and villas along this coast. The enumeration of these belongs to more minute topography than any in which we can indulge ; but we may mention Fairy-hill, the villa at Oldford, St. John's, and St. Appley, as being very superior in point of situation, and as affording an example in the case of the latter especially, how well exotic shrubs thrive in this part of the Island. Ryde, with its long pier and its somewhat cityish aspect hereafter to be described, is an object of considerable inte rest, and when the tide is in it is beautiful, in spite of a lit tle incongruity between the style of the buildings and the natural idea we form of a small island dependent chiefly upon its agriculture for support; but, when it is lost sight of, the remainder of the coast, all the way to Cowes har bour, is exceedingly pleasant, and offers scarcely anything that can offend the most fastidious eye. This is also a part of the coast upon which it is both pleasant and convenient to keep close in-shore, so as to be between the land and the Mother Bank, which extends parallel to the land the greater part of the bay. Binstead, about a mile west of the pier at Cowes, is a very pleasant place, with a shore formed into graceful sweeps, and wooded down to the water's edge \u2014 there being a wood of considerable extent attached to the Cottage. Nearly a mile and a half west of Binstead, Wootton-bridge creek opens to the left, and extends fully a mile inland, until it is inter rupted by a weir or dam, constructed for the use of a mill which is partly tidal, and partly dependent upon a small stream which descends through the valley here. The banks of this creek are among the most pleasant spots on this coast of the Island ; as one may judge, from the principal and most richly-endowed abbey being situated here. A mile and a quarter more from Wootton-creek brings one to the creek at King's key, so called, we believe, from having been the spot where King John took shipping, after he thought he had so far succeeded in securing the assistance of the"], [161, "JiuirAr.trr skli/i ,h,,i St-r she Ituprirtor safRiiittU ('otlfjft Ahnt ByDFGtlmoui diShcZiiranJfygh Sired"], [162, ""], [163, "127 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Pope, as to be able, with the assistance of foreign merce naries, to wrest the newly-acquired Magna Charta from the barons and people of England. But, although John found his Holiness quite willing to absolve him from his oath, and to anathematize the charter, by bell, book, and candle, John found the people of England not quite so ready to give up the palladium of that freedom, which the tyranny of the monarch had rendered imperiously necessary, and their own bravery and determination had won. In those days, popes appear to have had no measure of piety but the length of purses ; and accordingly, they were ever ready to grant any manner of licence for doing or undoing anything he had a mind \u2014 provided the granter could pay the price required ; and, in supplement to this, they were ready to consign to Satan, finally and for ever, any one who happened to withstand the most atrocious deed for which their sanction had been bought. While this was the case, and when the printing press was unknown, and the best book might have been rendered extinct by the burning of a copy or two, we need not wonder that the bodies of men were oppressed, and their minds enslaved, under so unholy and monstrous a tyranny. But, happily for us, the darkness of these days has passed away ; and though the evil-spirit still lingers among monastic ruins and monastic perpetrations, and re quires the restraining hand of public opinion to prevent it doing mischief; yet it can now only mutter secret curses against the light which is abroad in the world, and dares not fulminate a single anathema, even from the throne of its rankest abomination. This is the grand Magna Charta of mankind, won by them in spite of popes and priests ; but, though it is only in comparatively recent times that this plant of renown has expanded its blossoms, and brought its fruits to maturity, yet the enforcement of the Charter of England from John at Runymede, and the setting at nought of his recreant baseness backed by the papal indulgence and anathema, must be numbered among the germs from which it has sprung."], [164, "128 SEA-TRIP ROUND The three miles of coast, from King's key to Cowes har bour, where the circumnavigation of the Island, in the way which we have taken it, may be supposed to terminate, is still very beautifully wooded, down to the water's edge ; and some of the buildings make a most respectable figure through the clustering trees. One of the most striking of these is East Cowes' castle ; and, as it stands on elevated ground, and is in great part embosomed in woods, until a near approach, the castellated form is not felt to be very much out of keeping with the quiet and sober character of the surrounding scenery. But, although this is the termination of the actual sea-coast of the Island, there is an extension which, both for the Islanders themselves and visitors, would be eminently desirable. This is the establishment of such a navigation, in the estuary of the Medina, as should carry the visitor at once to Newport, and make that the principal landing-place, as it is the appropriate capital, of the Island. Of the mode of doing this, we shall have to say something when we come to treat of Newport as a town ; and as in fluensive, and being influenced, by the rest of the Island ; but we many hint, in the meantime, that without the eight or nine miles of navigation up and down this beautiful estuary, a sail round the Island is not complete. One other matter may be noticed, as enabling such as may desire it, to associate locally the places on the coast with those which we have yet to mention in the interior ; and that is the artificial divisions of the Island, to which the several parts of the coast are referable ; and in this respect, they and their several extents are as follows: \u2014 From Cowes harbour to Rocken-end, near the eastern ter mination of the land-slip of 1799, the shores are those of the province of West Medina ; and from Rocken-end round by the eastern part of the Island to East Cowes are the shores of the province of East Medina, \u2014 the former being, on a rude estimate and disregarding the small inlets, a total extent of about 29 miles, and the latter about 26 miles. Along the western coast, from Cowes harbour, we have"], [165, "129 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. about four miles of the coast formed by, or belonging to, the parish of Northwood. The next mile, as far west as the entrance of Newton river, is in the parish of Cal borne ; and from the river westward, to within half a mile of Yarmouth, the parish of Shalfleet lies along the coast ; Yarmouth itself is a very small parish, not exceeding half armile in its greatest extent. From Yarmouth harbour, on the north, all the way round by the western part of the Island, to more than two miles eastward of Freshwater bay, the coasts are those of the extensive parish of Freshwater; then Brook, Shalfleet, and Motteston, succeed each other on about half-a-mile of the line of shore ; after which there is Brixton, for nearly three miles to the Hatherfield rocks, about half-a-mile of Shorwell, then nearly the same extent of Brixton again ; after which, two miles and a half of the coast of Chale parish bring one to the termination of the West Medina on the south coast. In coasting this half of the Island, therefore, one passes the boundaries of ten pa rishes. Pursuing the coast eastward, there is first about a mile and a half of Niton, a mile of Whitwell, rather more than a mile of St. Lawrence, three-quarters of a mile of Godshill, rather more than a mile of Newchurch, and about a mile and a half of Bonchurch, which brings one to Luccomb chine ; then Shanklin extends a mile and a half, Brading the same along Sandown bay, Yaverland about the same at Redcliff toward the Culver cliffs, Brading again rather better than three miles more to the entrance of the harbour; after that, St. Helen's to near Ryde, four miles ; Newchurch, from the end of Ryde to near Binstead, a mile and a quarter ; Binstead thence to Wootton bridge, about two miles ; Wootton for about a mile and a half; and Whippingham for about two miles and a half to East Cowes. Thus, in coasting East Medina, we pass along the shores of fourteen parishes ; which are the whole contained in this liberty of the Island, whereas there are four pa rishes in West Medina that have no sea-coast. If we con sider the estuary of the Medina as being sea-coast, it has s"], [166, "130 SEA-TRIP ROUND THE ISLE OF WIGHT. the parish of Whippingham along the whole eastern side, to Shide bridge above Newport, Northwood three miles, and Newport one mile on the opposite side. It is of considerable importance to understand the order and extent of these several localities, inasmuch as they enable one to refer to places of interest when the map is not at hand. In like manner, a previous knowledge of the coast, \u2014 that is a personal survey of it on the trip round, is a great assistance to a subsequent understanding of all the places during a tour through the interior. These, with the great lines of road are, as.it were, the skeleton, upon the proper understanding of which, the order and usefulness of one's knowledge of the Island must in a great measure de pend. Having noticed these preliminary matters we shall now proceed to a very brief notice of the history, the to pography, and statistics ; and then close our account with such notices of individual subjects of interest as our limits will admit."], [167, "131 HISTORICAL OUTLINE. CHAPTER VI. HISTORICAL OUTLINE. The Isle of Wight cannot strictly be said to have any history of its own, as distinct from that of England, of which it always formed a part since England was a king dom. On the traditional accounts of it in the early times no reliance can be placed, because we do not know that they have been handed down from anything like authentic sources, or have had their origin at the time of the events to which they relate. We must farther bear in mind, that oral traditions are exceedingly treacherous matters, even in those cases where there is no motive, and therefore no ima ginable intention, to deceive. We know that, in the case of any event which makes an impression and becomes a tale of the day, scarcely any two relaters of that tale, even though they have been eye-witnesses of that which they relate, give their relations in the same manner. This is the case, to a very considerable extent, even among those who are well-educated, can discriminate between truth and false hood, and are regarded as persons of probity ; and, if this holds among them \u2014 as it does hold in every instance where a thorough investigation can be made, much more must it hold among the ignorant \u2014 as proneness to exaggeration is the invariable character of persons of this description. S 2"], [168, "132 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF Such persons are seldom or ever able to understand or appreciate the real and natural causes of striking events, and therefore, they invariably have recourse to supernatu ral ones, and ascribe the ordinary course of nature to a succession of miraculous or special interferences of powers, of good or evil as the case may be, and completely over look those invariable laws, which the Almighty Creator has seen meet to give to the world in all its phenomena and productions, and to human beings among the rest. We do not understand the general laws by which mankind have been distributed over the different countries of the world, \u2014 why one race should inhabit one district, and another race another; why one should advance in civilization, knowledge, and refinement, and another should remain stationary in barbarism, or even appear to retrograde ; or, why one race should spread itself in colonies over many lands, while another gradually wastes away in the land of its fathers ; but, though we do not know the causes of these or of many other matters connected with the history of the human race, we know that they must have causes ; and, that those causes, if one could find them out, would be perfectly ade quate to the performance and explanation of the effects. It is with some such precautions as these that one should enter upon the early history of every country \u2014 that shadowy part of its annals, which lies between the darkness of utter ignorance and the time when facts begin to be recorded immediately as they occur. Even in this latter case much judgment and discrimination are necessary before we can have even a chance of arriving at the truth. It is only the greater movements of men, or of societies of men, that go upon the record \u2014 for the memorial tale of most men 'is as much a blank as their understandings and their lives ; and those great men and great events which are the subjects of history, make strong impressions upon the passions or emotions of the people, and affect different individuals differently, according as they agree or disagree with the feelings of those individuals, and not according as they are"], [169, "133 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. true or false, right or wrong, in an abstract and absolute point of view. Hence, the history of a great war for in stance, or the biography of some restless and ambitious con queror, who has kept the world in turmoil, cannot be impartially written until a good many years have elapsed. Even then there is a source of error, because that which is recorded as the materials of history, has always more or less of the feelings, biasses and opinions of the recorders, blended with it ; and there are few historians who have sufficient acumen for separating the dross of these from the sterling ore of the genuine history. With regard to the early history of England, and of course of that of the Isle of Wight as part and parcel of England, we are in a worse predicament than in the case of history posterior to the times of record and writing. The chroniclers were generally of the monastic orders \u2014 belonged to a set of mankind who were estranged from the working world, opposed to it in all their leading interests, and de voted to a species of sacerdotal monster, which stood in op position to the general well-being of the human race, and exerted all its influence \u2014 which was very considerable, in appropriating the possessions, and enslaving and misleading the minds, of the rest of men. Such parties were but ill qualified to perform the office of historians, even if the materials upon wThich they had to work had been of the best quality, and in the greatest abundance. Of the Isle of Wight, before the Roman invasion, no thing is known with certainty. The probability is, how ever, that, when in the hands of the earliest, or Celtic Britons, it was, like all other parts of the country, divided into small parcels or clanships, the chiefs of which were, as was usual among these people wherever they existed, in very general hostility with each other ; and this seems to have been the cause why they, who were brave and pug nacious enough, were easily subdued by any invading peo ple, among whom the advantages of union were better understood. It is said that, during the time of these peo-"], [170, "134 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF pie, the Island was called Guith, but we believe this has no better foundation than conjecture. It has also been al leged that, in very early times, when the Ph\u0153nicians resorted to Britain for tin, the part which they frequented was in the Isle of Wight, at, or near, Puckaster cove, in the parish of Niton. This, however, is exceedingly im probable ; because the carrying of the tin from Cornwall to the Isle of Wight, would have been a very laborious matter, and the voyage to the Ph\u0153nician traders would have been rendered much longer and more dangerous, while Puckaster cove, or any other place at the back of the Island, would have been not only an unsafe, but absolutely an impracticable harbour, even for the trading gallies of those times. We must, therefore, discard this story as one of those fancies which antiquaries are very apt to entertain, especially upon subjects where they know that there is not any real evidence to contradict their assertions. If the Ph\u0153nicians had traded to this Island for any length of time, as they are understood to have done to some part or other of the south coast of Britain, there would have been, in all probability, some memorials of them, \u2014 though it is not impossible that such memorials may have been covered by land-slips. The possibility of this does not, however, in the slightest degree, invalidate the physical objections which there are to the back of the Island as a resort for shipping. We shall quote from Whitaker's History of Manchester, the opinion of that gentleman upon the subject ; because, though perhaps one of the most theorizing, he was one of the most specious of antiquaries. \" The Greeks of Marseilles,\" says Mr. W., \"first followed the tracks of the Ph\u0153nician voyagers, and before the days of Polybius, and about 200 years before Christ, began to share with them in the trade of tin. The Carthaginian commerce declined ; the Marseillian commerce increased; and in the reign of Augustus, the whole current of the British traffic had been gradually diverted into this channel. Two roads were laid across the countrv, and reached from Sandwich to Carnar-"], [171, "135 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. von on the one side ; and extended from Dorsetshire into Suffolk on the other. The great staple of tin was no longer settled in a distant corner of the Island. It was removed from Scilly, and fixed at the Isle of Wight, a central part of the coast, lying equally betwixt the two roads, and better adapted to the new arrangement of the trade. Thither the tin was carried by the Belg\u00e6, and thither the foreign merchants resorted with their wares.\" He adds further, \" that the Isle of Wight, which, as late as the eighth century, was separated from the remainder of Hampshire, by a channel no less than three miles in breadth, was now actually a part of the greater Island; disjoined from it only by the tide, and united to it always at the ebb. And during the recess of the waters, the Britons continually passed over the low isthmus of land, and carried their loaded carts of tin across it.\" But, although it is highly improbable that either the Ph\u0153nicians or the Marseilloise traded to any part of the Isle of Wight for tin, and more especially to the back of the Island, it is most likely, indeed almost certain, that those Belgic tribes who successively colonized the southern parts of the main-land of Britain, also took possession of the Isle of Wight, \u2014 though it is probable that their in- vasions were made, not from the back of the Island, but from the north. These people, both from the characters of their own shcres and harbours, and for the sake of getting support, naturally ascended the bays and estuaries of rivers ; and hence we may conjecture \u2014 upon such a subject we can- not but conclude, that the Newtown water and the Medina were the inlets to which they resorted. Brading harbour may indeed be supposed to have lain nearer to them ; but then, as wells cased with stone have been discovered in the bed of that harbour a great way within the present flood- mark, there is some reason to think that, in those early times, it had no existence, except partially as a marsh, or a damp and dense forest. There is another circumstance worthy of notice. The barrows which have been opened"], [172, "136 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF in the Isle of Wight, appear to have been nearly the same in their contents as those on the Hampshire and Wiltshire downs ; and there is every reason to believe that these were constructed long before the time ofthe Romans, and that they mark the several places where contests took place between the old inhabitants and the invaders. To which party some of the weapons and trinkets which have been found in these belonged, or whether they were originally the manu facture of either party, it is impossible to say ; but, cer tainly they are not Roman, or else they would have con tained some of the characteristic insignia, or memorials of that people. Of the urns found in the Isle of Wight, some are of handsome shape, and well-finished, and others are more rude, exactly analogous in composition, in form, and in their rude ornaments, to some which have been met with in Scotland, where, though the Romans fought, and in so far conquered, they never established anything like a per manent residence. Some more modern articles, which in all probability could not have existed since those alluded to were deposited, have been met with in those barrows ; and skeletons have been found, less mouldered than so long a date would lead one to expect ; but still, no conclusion as to the barrows themselves being modern, can be drawn from these relics ; because there is sometimes a proneness to inter human beings in situations where former interment has taken place, without any very obvious cause for the preference ; and those who bury their dead are generally not in a disposition to violate the remains of the former owner of the sepulchre. It should seem that, in the more ancient burials in those barrows, cremation had wholly or partially taken place; for the urns, or places where the urns are found, generally contain portions of charcoal, or bones partially charred. This burning of the dead is a singular matter, and one cannot well account for it except upon the supposition that the friends of those interred were unwilling that their remains should become the prey of the beasts of the field, or the fowls of the air ; but, it is"], [173, "137 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. worthy of remark that, if the incineration be so performed as to produce charcoal, this charcoal is the most lasting me morial of the dead that can well possibly be imagined, as it is more proof against every kind of destroying influence underground, than any other substance with which we are acquainted. Those barrows and places of ancient sepulture, are not very numerous in the Isle of Wight, which would seem to indicate that there has not been a great deal of fighting at any of the very ancient invasions of it ; but their position would seem to point out, that the invaders had landed from the Solent, and pushed their conquests into the remotest parts of the Island, instead of landing on the back of the Island and making their advances the other way. This circumstance is strongly against 'the notion of an ancient port at the back of the Island ; because, if the emporium of a commerce, considerable for the time at which it was car ried on, had been situated where the antiquaries say, it would have been the centre of attraction to every invading power. We must therefore discard as a mere fiction this notion ot the early commercial celebrity of the Island ; and we may remark, in passing, that we think it exceedingly probable that the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight, and those of Corn wall, to whatever races we may suppose them to belong, were quite ignorant of each other's existence, until times considerably more recent than those alluded to. As is the case with the rest of Britain, the authentic his tory of the Isle of Wight begins with the Roman invasion, though it does not appear that there was any absolute settle ment, or conquest of the Island, until one hundred years after the landing of Julius C\u00e6sar. In A. D. 43, the Emperor Claudius sent an army into Britain, under Plautius ; and, though it would be 'absurd to suppose that imperial Rome fitted out a grand armament for she capture of one small Island, yet it is by no means improbable that it was during this war, for the increase of territory in the larger Island, that T"], [174, "138 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF the Romans first extended the triumphant wings of their eagle over the smaller one. To the Romans, the Isle of Wight seems to have been an easy conquest, \u2014 or rather perhaps they were received by the inhabitants of the Island in a friendly manner, as they appear in a great measure to have been by the Belgic inha bitants of Hampshire. It is probable that the Islanders were the same people, and that the Island might then have been fully as fertile in corn, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as it is even now ; and, as the effects of the Romans upon the Belg\u00e6 in the main-land of Hampshire, was to civilize, rather than enslave, it is highly probable that the same may have been the case in this Island. Tacitus indeed mentions that the Roman general, who conquered, or took possession of, the Isle of Wight, fought thirty battles with the Britons, and subdued two powerful nations ; but there is no reason to believe that the thirty battles were fought, or one or both of the two powerful nations conquered, in this Island. If the Romans had had to contend against any powerful opposition, and for any length of time, the usual marks of protracted Roman warfare would have been found, in camps, in fortified lines, and in roads, and there would also have been a fortified place in some of the estua ries for the protection of the galleys. Not a vestige of any of these is however to be found ; and though it is probable that the Romans, or rather the Romanized Belg\u00e6, had a strong hold at Carisbrook, and formed that deepest of the wells there which is now filled up, it is more probable that this was a central fort of occupation, where a stand might be made against future invaders, than a point from which con quest was extended over the Island. A few Roman coins have indeed been found in the vicinity of Carisbrook, of the Emperors, Tiberius, Germanicus, Vespasian, and others ; but these have been so few in number, and so unaccompanied with other Roman remains \u2014 such as weapons, altars, urns, and tiles, that they cannot be supposed to indicate a Roman sta-"], [175, "139 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. tion, where warriors had their abode, and Roman customs were exclusively established. The few coins may be easily accounted for, on the supposition that they were part of the payments made for the produce of the Island ; and that they should be found near Carisbrook castle, is rather a proof that the people had retreated to that strong-hold, during the fury of the Saxon invasion, than that these coins had been left by the Romans themselves. The Gauls, and subse quently the Romans and Gauls, or the Romanized Gauls as we may with more propriety term them, had certainly traded with the South of England, previous to thv. invasion by Julius C\u00e6sar, but how long previous is not known. It appears too, that, in those mercantile transactions, the merchants of Gaul were purchasers of the produce of Britain, and not merely exchangers of commodities ; and therefore we may be prepared to expect vestiges of Roman money, which had come into the country in the way of trade, and without any reference to invasion or war of any kind. Throughout the whole of its history indeed, there is the strong presumptive evidence that the Isle of Wight was a peaceful place, unless when invaded from without ; and that, even in the case of invasion, no very formidable or determined resistance was made by the inhabitants, until they found that they were part and parcel of united England, and had hopes of being backed by its power. If the dominion of the Romans had been a grievous yoke upon the Islanders, it is highly probable that some Roman or other historian, or some chronicler, would have recorded instances of hostility during the four centuries that the Romans maintained their ascendancy in the country, and, as we have reason to believe, extended its civilization; but, during the whole time, there is not the slightest allusion to any disturbance of the kind ; and thus it is propable that the Islanders went on cultivating their fields, and enjoying the fruits of their labour, without serious quarrel with any one. There is one matter not unworthy of notice as bearing upon this subject; and that is the fact that there are no vestiges t2"], [176, "140 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF of what is considered as the religion of the Druids in this Island. In no part of Britain are there greater facilities for erecting those circles and benches of stones, which are, improperly perhaps, denominated Druidical temples; and, in the Under-cliff especially, logans, or rocking-stones, might have been obtained in the same with very little labour, though the materials are probably more tender than those where such memorials are found. There is no doubt, however, that, if the people had had a strong disposition to the use of these things, they would have contrived to obtain them of such materials as the Island afforded ; and therefore, as they are nowhere to be found, we must conclude that the people inhabiting the Island, never used such ceremonies. This is remarkable, as remains of this kind are found on the main-land, and also in the Channel Islands. The first notice that we have of a conquest of the Isle of Wight, by strong and determined hostilities, is that by the West Saxons, under the nephew of Cerdic. There is no account given of the Christian religion having been esta blished in the Island previous to this period ; and therefore, Cerdic or his generals could have no inducement to set up the religion of Woden upon the ruins of the Cross. We have mentioned in a former volume of our general account of Hampshire, the length of time which Cerdic had to bat tle, and the numerous reinforcements which he had to draw, both from Saxony and from Jutland, before he could obtain possession of Winchester, and establish the kingdom of the West Saxons there ; and it appears to have been several years after this event that he first turned his attention to the Isle of Wight. How the inhabitants that were found in the Island were treated by the Saxon conqueror we have no means of ascertaining. He is said to have placed a great number of Jutes, or Jutlanders, whom he brought from the continent, in the Island ; but to what extent they oppressed or dislodged the inhabitants, is not stated by the chroniclers. The fact is, that the grand motive of those early chroniclers appears to have been to set forth the great cruelty and spoli-"], [177, "141 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. ation perpetrated upon religion, or, to speak more correctly, upon churchmen and church property; and, as there does not appear to have been either the one or the other of these in the Isle of Wight in those days, there was of course nothing in it to stir up the lamentation and wrath of the monastic annalists, who were always more alive to the rob bery of a monk than the sacking of a city. Withgar and Stuffa, the nephews of Cerdic, were the par ties to whom he assigned the Isle of Wight ; probably in return for the service which they and the reinforcement with which they landed at Cerdicshore, and by the aid of which he succeeded in his conquests, and in founding the kingdom of Wessex, \u2014 as it was usual for invaders in those times, to assign tracts of country to their followers, who were afterwards to win it with their swords, This mode of remuneration extended down through all the gradations of the barbaric hordes ; and thus their wars became wars of extermination, not of mere conquest. They sought the lands of the people, and not their labour; and therefore they slew all before them without mercy. These Jutes, who came from a more northerly region than the Saxons or the Angles, \u2014 from the same country, indeed, whence the Danes subsequently issued, and made such dreadful retaliations upon Saxons, Angles, and Jutes, for the cruelties which these three practised upon the Romanized Britons. We have already said that there is no reason to suppose that the inhabitants of the Island were converted to Christianity at the time when Withgar and Stuffa had the Island assigned to them, and took possession in the fullest sense of the word ; and it does not appear that Roman luxury, or Roman mythology, had been introduced to any great extent ; because there is no trace, either of villa, or of temple or idol ; of both of which there have been found memorials in the adjoining parts of the main-land, with the exception, we believe, of the New Forest district, in which the only Roman remains are fortified camps and portions of road. Hence, it is probable, that the conquest of this Island, by"], [178, "142 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF these leaders, was both easy and inglorious ; and for some time a cloud of impenetrable darkness again settles over its history. It is stated by Bede, by Henry of Huntingdon, and by the Saxon Chronicle, that Cerdic did not assign the Island to his nephews, to be won by their own swords, but that, after he had fully established his power on the main land, he and his son Kenric passed over to the Island with a large army, butchered the whole of the inhabitants, who had assembled in the strong-hold of Carisbrook, and then gave the heritage of the dead to his nephew and followers. It is possible, that the iron spear-heads, which have been dug out of the barrows, may have belonged to those Britons ; for they are known to have made use of the spear, while the sword was the great weapon of the Saxons ; but the more likely account is, that these relics are of much more ancient date. This mode of obtaining possession, if such was the mode, rendered that possession perfectly secure, except from fo reign invasion ; and accordingly, there appears to have been no disturbance until the West Saxons were defeated by the Mercians ; who presented the Island to the South Saxons, as having been their confederates in the war. This occurred about 57 years after the Saxons obtained possession, that is in or about the year 661. No account is given of any re sistance at this transfer of the Island j and therefore, it is probable that the land and the people together were peace ably handed over, without any extermination. About 25 years afterwards, however, or about 686, Caedwalla, king of the West Saxons, entered the Island with a destroying army, with the resolution of exterminating the whole of the inhabitants ; but, as this savage ruler had become nominally a Christian, he was induced, at the representation of Wilfred, bishop of Selsey, to give them the alternative of baptism or the sword. It does not appear to what extent the former alternative was granted or accepted, or how far it prevented the latter ; for the chronicles have it, that the sons of the ruler, or king as he was then called, were baptized and then murdered."], [179, "143 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. When the Danes began to retaliate upon the cruelties of the Saxons, by the perpetration of cruelties equally great, the Isle of Wight appears to have been a rendezvous, and favourite place of plunder, \u2014 probably because it was in a less defensive state than the main-land. This appears to have been continued during every descent of the Danes, who had their principal magazines in the Island ; and it is highly probable, that the advantages which this Island and the embayed shores of the opposite land afforded to these notorious robbers, were among the causes which suggested to the great Alfred the establishment of a warlike navy as the only certain bulwark of the British shores against foreign invasion. And, had the successors of Alfred been worthy of his throne, had union prevailed among the people, had the grasping of the Church been less, and had one tithe of the money expended on baubles to dazzle the ignorant in the performance of what was most impiously denominated the worship of God, been devoted to the public service, no hostile foot would have been permitted to rest upon British soil. But, as the throne ofthe Saxons was originally founded in blood, so they sunk into low sensuality, and w ere guil ty of the most atro cious crimes ; so that the weal of the nation, and indeed the preserving of England as a country having any claims to civilization, demanded that the dynasty should be changed. As had been usual during two centuries, the Isle of Wight was a sufferer on this occasion. The intrigues and vices of Queen Emma, the unprincipled ambition of Earl Godwin, and other circumstances of the times, were prepar ing to divide the kingdom into two great sections, which the fanatical and feeble Edward the Confessor was but ill able to re-unite. When Earl Godwin was banished, he ob tained an armament from the earl of Flanders, with which he made a descent, in 1052, upon the Isle of Wight, waited there for his son Harold, \u2014 the usurper who fell afterwards at the battle of Hastings, and spoiled and plundered the people with the most wanton cruelty. Four years after wards Tosti, earl of Northumberland, one of the sons of"], [180, "144 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF Earl GodAvin, and son-in-law to the same earl of Flanders, who had assisted that plunderer, was banished from his earldom, obtained forces in the same quarter as his father, and made a fresh descent upon the Island ; which he again plundered, and obtained forcible possession of a considerable number of the best manors, and in all probability bestowed others upon the officers of his marauding band. Thus, the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight, except in so far as they dreaded the oppression of his brother, could not but rejoice at the overthrow of Harold, whomsoever might have been his conqueror. As Tosti had been slain at the battle of Stamford-bridge, fighting against his brother Harold, there was of course no one to claim his lands in the Isle of Wight ; and therefore, William had only to take and distribute the lordships of the different manors; and as it appears, by the Doomsday Survey, that William appropriated to himself the whole, or at least the greater part, of the lands which had belonged to Tosti, it is highly probable that, in consequence of the repeated plunderings which they had suffered, and which were of course accompanied by their due share of murders, the Saxon inhabitants of the Isle of Wight were at this time very few, and that the paucity of them was supplied by more than an equal portion of Normans. At all events, the con quest appears to have been, to this Island, an era of delive rance ; for it remained tranquil and, as we may suppose, prosperous, for a long time afterwards. At the time of the Conquest, or at all events when the Doomsday Survey was made up, the Island appears to have contained about 109 or 110 manors. Of these, the king himself was proprietor of 19, \u2014 some of the largest and most valuable of which had been in the possession of Earl Tosti. The Norman barons, or nobles, to whom lands had been granted by the Conqueror, \u2014 chiefly those which had belonged to Saxons, and probably Saxons who had sided with Ha rold, \u2014 were three : \u2014 William Fitz-Stur, who had 22 manors, William Fitz-Azor, who had 24, and Gozaline Fitz-A\u00abor,"], [181, "145 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. the brother of William, who had twenty-five manors, but chiefly of minor extent, remained in the hands of the same Saxon thanes that had held them in the time of King Edward the Confessor. Besides these, the very large manor of Calbourn, including the whole of that sub-hundred, and estimated altogether at between 3000 and 4000 acres, was held by Walkelin, bishop of Winchester ; one manor belonged to St. Nicholas, and another to the abbey of St. Mary Wil ton ; and these were attached to the abbey of St. Mary de Lire, or rather to the six churches possessed by that abbey, in the Island, containing from 250 to 300 acres of land. The chief government of the Island was granted by the Conqueror to William Fitz-Osborne, who had been his marshal in the battle of Hastings, whom he afterwards cre ated earl of Hereford, and made keeper of the castles of Winchester and York ; and the Isle of Wight he was com missioned to hold, as freely as William himself held the king dom of England. It appears that Fitz-Osborne served his master with ability and zeal ; but he stands accused, with what truth we shall not attempt to explain, of ejecting the proprietors of the Island, aud giving the lands to his own followers. This, if true, must have taken place anterior to the drawing up of Doomsday Book, which was completed in 1086, sixteen years after Fitz-Osborne was created earl of Hereford. In 1082, Odo, bishop of Bayeaux, and half-brother to William, determined to go to Rome, and endeavour to get himself made Pope, without consulting William in the matter; but William, having ascertained that such was his intention, came to the Island and seized him ; and two years afterwards, while visiting the Island on his way to Normandy, William levied pretty heavy contributions upon the inhabitants ; but whether on account of their having connived at his half brother's attempt to be made Pope without royal authority, is not stated in the record. Fitz-Osborne fell in one of William's foreign battles, and was succeeded in his English titles and possessions by Roger, his youngest son. This L\""], [182, "146 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF baron engaged with the earl of Norfolk, the earl of Northum berland, and some others, in a conspiracy to dethrone the Conqueror, notwithstanding the honours and emoluments which William had bestowed upon his father. This con spiracy was disclosed to the king by the earl of Northum berland, who prayed for forgiveness at the same time that he disclosed a conspiracy in which he had taken a part ; but William ordered him to be beheaded at Winchester, proba bly for having first betrayed the royal cause, and then that of his fellow conspirators. Earl Roger did not, in the mean time, fall into the power of the king ; but retired to his castle at Hereford, and endeavoured to muster an army, but he was taken prisoner, and sentenced to perpetual imprison ment. He died in confinement ; and thus all his honours became extinct, and his property escheated to the crown. It does not appear that during the reign of Rufus any lord of the Island was appointed ; but Henry, the successor of Rufus, granted the lordship of the Island, with numerous possessions in it and other places, to Richard Redvers, earl of Devon, who had been of great service to Henry in his contest with his brother Robert. This lord of the Island remained faithful to the king who had appointed him ; but, in 1137, Earl Baldwin de Redvers, his son, became a parti zan ofthe Empress Maud, and fortified the Island, from which he was expelled by King Stephen. At the adjustment of the dispute between that sovereign and the empress, he was however restored to his titles and estates, which descended to his son ; and both appear to have remained at rest, and the Island to have been tranquil, during the reign of Henry II and Richard. William de Vernon, to whom the lordship had by that time descended, had the style and title of earl of the Isle of Wight. This Vernon was one of those who bore the silken canopy over C\u0153ur de Lion, upon his second coronation at Winchester. King John compelled this Vernon to pay a fine of 500 marks, for liberty to govern his tenants in the Isle of Wight by military law ; and, although such acts as these on the part"], [183, "147 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. of John, were only attempts to swalloAV up in the grand tyranny of the king the petty tyrannies which were practised by the barons, yet this, and the repetition of it in other cases, were among the leading circumstances which extorted from John that charter which is considered as the palladium of English liberty ; and, in so far as that was the case, this charter of freedom must be looked upon as the emanation of conflicting tyrannies, \u2014 a verification of the adage, that, when men of a certain character fall out, those of another charac ter get their own. After Vernon had purchased his military sway by the pay ment of the 500 marks, it appears that he and his Islanders were upon the best terms with John. As we have already hinted, when that ambitious and shuffling monarch had re solved that the plastic subserviency of the Pope should be made use of in absolving him from \" fetters of parchment \" \u2014 and of the most solemn oaths, he made the Island the scene of his retirement; and the better to conceal his purposes, laid aside all the semblances of royalty, and associated with fishermen and sailors, while he was carrying on his machi nations for destroying the newly-acquired freedom of his subjects, by papal connivance, and by the mercenary arms of foreign hirelings. The son of William de Veinon pursued the same quiet course as his father ; so that during the long reign of Henry III, surnamed of Winchester \u2014 that being the place of his birth, the Isle of Wight made no figure in his tory. In the reign of Edward I the lordship of the Island had devolved on Isabella de Fortibus, great-grand-daughter of William de Vernon ; and, as her daughter Aveline de For tibus had been, first the ward, and afterwards the wife, of his younger brother Edmund, he turned his thoughts to the acquiring the lordship of the Island. Aveline died Avithout issue, before the demise of her mother ; and Edward, who had previously made arrangements with his brother for the reversion, in case of the lordship coming into his hands, purchased the lordship ofthe old lady, Avhile on her death-bed, u 2"], [184, "148 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF for the small sum of 6000 marks. As the deed of convey ance was sealed at three in the afternoon, and Isabella died about midnight, doubts were raised as to the fairness and validity of the deed. Edward, however, kept undisturbed possession during his life-time, and appointed wardens for the safe keeping of the Island ; among whom was the cele brated Adam de Gurdon, who, from a sort of brigand had become a benefactor to religious houses and a favourite of kings. Edward II granted the sale of the wardenship to his favourite courtier, Piers Gaveston ; but, this having given offence to the nobility, he resumed it, and appointed his eldest son and successor, Edward. During his reign, and that of Richard II, the instability of the government ren dered England somewhat feeble ; and the French occasion ally landed on the shores of the Isle of Wight, committing plunder and devastation. The Island indeed, was ill-fitted for defence. The only fortified place in it was Carisbrook castle, which was near the centre of the Island ; and thus, the enemy could land and plunder all the shores without the slightest opposition, driving the people before them to this castle as the only place of safety, and leaving all their pro perty behind them as an easy prey. In 1337, the French acquired such boldness as to assail Carisbrook itself, but they were betrayed iuto an ambuscade, and defeated with great slaughter. Yet, although the castle was thus proof against their assault, the Island was still as much at their mercy as though they had not been defeated under the castle walls; and accordingly, they levied 1000 marks on the inhabi tants, and bound them, under an oath, not to resist their pro gress in case they should return on a predatory expedition. During this inroad, even though beaten before the walls of Carisbrook, the French burnt the towns of Yarmouth and Newtown, and the village of Ryde. William Montacute, earl of Salisbury, was appointed to the government of the Island in the ninth year of Richard II ; and after his demise, the lordship was granted to Ed ward, earl of Rutland and duke of York, the brave, but"], [185, "149 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. unwieldy leader of the van at the battle of Agincourt, who was trodden down and suffocated in the throng on that eventful day. In the reign of Henry IV, also, a French party came to keep their Christmas, but were beaten ; and another came, demanding a subsidy in the name of the un fortunate Richard and his queen. This last party were offered time to land and refresh themselves before the Islanders should give them battle, but they declined the latter part of the offer. Henry VI conferred the title of king of the Isle of Wight on the duke of Warwick, per forming, as it is said, the ceremony of coronation with his own hand. But this was an empty title ; and the Island was held by Humphrey, styled \u2014 though one does not know for what good reason \u2014 the good duke of Gloucester, to whom it had been assigned by the duchess of York, after the suffocation of her husband at Agincourt. The next lord was the famous Richard Plantagenet, duke of York ; and not long after him Edmund, duke of Somerset ; but he fell in the battle of St. Alban's, and his son was executed after the battle of Hexham. Woodville, Earl Rivers, was appointed lord by Edward IV ; but he was beheaded at Pontefract, as one of those whom Richard wished to remove out of the way. Henry VII conferred the office on the brother of this nobleman'; and that brother having unfor tunately led the flower of the population to an expedition against the king of France, the whole were slain, with the exception of one boy, and the Island was well-nigh de populated. After the failure of Sir Edward Woodville, it does not appear that any other captain of the Island was appointed with such plenary powers as they had formerly held ; but the deputies of the king who followed them do not seem to have been less zealous in the defence of the Island. After various other wardens, captains, or governors, Richard Worsley, the founder of the house of Appulder comb \u2014 of whom we believe Sir Richard, the historian of the Island, was the last in the direct line \u2014 was appointed to the command by Henry VIII, in 1541, at the same time that"], [186, "150 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF Thomas Lord Cromwell was constable of Carisbrook. Four years after Worsley received his commission a French fleet, much superior in number than that which the English had to oppose to them, made its appearance in the Channel ; and after the English fleet had gone into a situation in which it was unsafe to follow them, the French landed on several parts of the Isle of Wight, and demonstrated their prowess by burning the dwellings of the defenceless inhabitants. It is supposed that they intended to fortify the Island and retain possession of it ; but having learned that Richard Worsley was making preparations to drive them out, they prudently saved him the trouble, and retreated to their ships. It was immediately consequent upon this, that the small and not very efficient castles, or forts, or batteries, or whatever else they may be called, were erected on different parts of the coasts of the Island, and also the shores of the narrow seas. The religion and politics of this gallant defender of the Island were adverse to Queen Mary's notions, and therefore he was dismissed from office during her reign; but appointed again when Elizabeth came to the throne. Though only one of the governors of the Island received the title of king, and does not appear to have exercised any sort of authority, yet they seem to have been Viceroys, holding and exercising very plenary powers. A commission, granted by Edward III, appointed John de Gatteston go vernor, authorised him to array men-at-arms, hoblers (light dragoons on small ponies,) and horsemen, with all others, horse as well as foot ; to levy new forces, if those arrayed were not sufficient, and to arm and marshal them. He was also to take men, to be paid by the king, from the county of Southampton, as well as from the Island, and this both within and without the liberties, (meaning of course the whole of Hampshire). Farther, he was to summon all absentees bound by their tenures to defend the castle or the Island ; to order them to return with their families within a limited time, under the forfeiture of their lands and goods to the king's use ; and, in case of their non-com-"], [187, "151 THE ISLE OF AVIGIIT. pliance, their places were to be supplied by the impressed men from the main-land of the county. This Avas a power of conscription fully as vigorous as that exercised by Na- poleon in the zenith of his power ; and, when the lords of the Island had so very extensiAre authority, it must, as in the case of all satraps, have depended very much on the per- sonal character of the governor for the time-being, whether he was mild or tyrannical in his lordly sway ; and, if a ty- rant, whether he Avas a fierce or a foolish one. Sir George Carey, who held the office under Elizabeth, after Sir Ed- ward Horley, appears to have taken vigorous measures for the defence of the Island, then threatened by the Invincible Armada ; and the rigour with which he brought those mea- sures into execution gave such offence, that a remonstrance was sent to the lords of council. This, however, met with little attention, and Sir George remained governor for twenty- one years; and under him the Island appeared to become as thriving in peace, as he had endeavoured to render it vi- gorous in war. Sir George seems to have been peculiarly hostile to lawyers, a class of persons who had not then found their way into the Island \u2014 where all matters were settled better by the dictum of the governor, or by the local court ; and Sir John Oglander, in a manuscript memoir written sometime after, mentions that when an attorney at- tempted to effect a settlement in the Island, he was, by command of the governor, \" with a pound of candles hang- ing at his breech, lighted, with bells about his legs, hunted out of the Island.\" The same faithful annalist mentions that the people lived quietly and securely, and had little to do with the courts at Winchester or London ; and that, if by chance any of them went to the latter place, they previously made their wills, \u2014 which practice was followed in the remote parts of Scotland, upon the people going even to Edin burgh, not more than a hundred years ago. It must be understood that, from the wretchedness or want of roads, and conveyances of all kinds, the danger of robbers and other casualties, a journey from the Isle of Wight to Lon-"], [188, "152 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF don, occupied nearly as many weeks as it now occupies hours by steam-boat and railway, and rolling at one's ease all the time, \u2014 into such juxta-position have the improve ments of modern art brought places which, only a short time ago, were considered \"wide as the poles asunder.\" Sir John Oglander lived to see a very different state of things in the Island; for he says, he has known an attorney bring down three hundred writs after one term, and twenty nisi prius cases tried at one assize ; whereas, in the time of Eli zabeth, there were not six writs in a whole year, or one nisi prius in six. Sir John has some very shrewd remarks against law-suits ; and he points out the period during which this extraordinary reverse befel the Island. It was in the reign of that sage monarch, '* Who stuck the pedant's chair above the throne ; Taught war with words, and war with words alone.\" \u2014 \" This country was undone with it,\" (law,) says Sir John, \"in King James his reign ; hazard death and all quarrels, rather than let thy tongue make its master a slave.\" But, notwithstanding the pest of law, of which the ba ronet thus complains, it appears that during the 22 years that Henry, earl of Southampton, was governor of the Island, its condition was much improved ; and, what with the agree able manners of the governor, Avhat with the lawyers, much greater intercourse with England generally seems to have taken place about this time. When the civil war broke out the then earl of Portland was governor ; but the Parliament, knowing his attachment to the office of royalty, without re gard to the mode of administration, had him removed, though they allowed his countess, and Colonel Brett, an officer appoint ed by Charles, to retain the castle of Carisbrook. The gentry of the Island were at this time very loyal, and fond of the good cheer and boon-companionship of the governor ; and they accordingly petitioned against his removal; but the great body of the people, at the head of whom was Moses Read, mayor of Newport, and colonel of the Newport mili-"], [189, "153 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. tia, took the other side with determined resolution ; and thus the Isle of Wight, which had been unaffected by the wars of the Roses, and other party squabbles among the monarchs of England, was now as completely divided as any part of the country could be. In 1642, Philip, earl of Pembroke, was appointed governor by the Parliament; but before he arrived hostilities had begun. On the representation of Colonel Read, the Parliament had authorised him to rein force his militia from the ships in the river, and take what steps he deemed best for the safety and preservation of the Island. The first of these steps was to march against the castle of Carisbrook, which was held by the countess of Portland, and Brett, with about twenty followers, while the besiegers consisted of the Newport militia, with 400 auxili aries from the ships. The castle was not prepared to stand a siege, not having more than three days' provisions for its small garrison; but, notwithstanding this, the bravery or hardihood of the countess made her stand by a gun with a lighted match, and demand terms or otherwise she would defend the castle to the last. Colonel Brett and his friends had their freedom in the Island, but were prohibited from leaving it ; but, upon a representation to Parliament, the countess and her family were commanded to quit it in twTo days, which was perhaps ultimately for the good of the Island, as the countess appears to have been of a dispo sition well calculated for stirring up a party ; and though her party must have been the minor one, yet much bloodshed would, in all probability, have been the result. The decisive measure of Read, in at once taking possession of Carisbrook, and following it up by the taking possession of all other forts, put an end to all fear of domestic hostilities in the Island ; and the courteous manner in which the earl of Pembroke received the tendered services of the people con tributed farther to secure domestic tranquillity; and thus, while the violence of civil war was raging and laying waste from the one end of Britain to the other, the Isle of Wight was comparatively at peace. Some of the leading in- x"], [190, "154 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF habitants were no doubt very much attached to the cause of Charles ; but, as the middle classes and the people, to a man, Avere strongly attached to the parliamentary cause, not a single troop, or company, could be mustered for that of the monarch. This perfect tranquillity of the Isle of Wight, amid the troubles of the main-land, had very happy effects upon the Island itself, and also affords a good moral and political lesson. For, while property of all kinds, through- out England and Scotland, was destroyed, or deteriorated in value, and people felt their dwellings, and even their lives insecure, the Isle of Wight was like an oasis in the political desert. Accordingly, many families, who disliked the vio- lence of both parties, resorted to the Island as the only spot upon which they could live in peace; and the conse- quence was, that the rent of land all over the Island was increased to full 25 per cent, upon what it had been previ- ously, and everything flourished to a corresponding degree, and so continued during the whole period of the Common- wealth ; so that during this period, which was one of com- parative destruction to many parts ofthe country, the Isle of Wight truly merited the appellation of \" the garden of Eng- land.\" When the Restoration came, however, the state of things was reversed ; and the voluptuous tranquillity which Charles II introduced, withdrew many families from the Island ; and, in consequence of having tasted this short-lived prosperity, it was probably sunk into deeper misery than it had ever experienced ; nor did this misery entirely cease till the Island became a place of summer resort ; in consequence of which, aided by the extreme facilities of communication that now exist, it bids fair to arrive at a state of improvement, unknowm and unprecedented in any other part of the country. The arrival of Charles I at Carisbrook, after his flight from Hampton court, and his conduct previous to his forcible removal from the Island, can hardly be considered as public events arising out of the history of the Island itself; because the delivery of Charles, by himself, up to Colonel Hammond, the then governor, was his own voluntary act, and had nothing to do with the state of matters in the Island. The"], [191, "155 THE ISLE *#F WIGHT. notice of it therefore properly belongs to our short account of Carisbrook castle ; but, as it was in some respects a pub lic matter, though not a matter arising out of anything im mediately connected with the Island, we will notice it here. The flight of Charles from Hampton court took place in the autumn of 1647 ; and as that misguided and unfortunate monarch was suspicious of most parties, he knew not Avell where to find a safe retreat. In this dilemma, he resolved to surrender himself into the hands of Colonel Robert Hammond, governor of the Island, who was nephew to the king's favourite chaplain ; and Charles thought that this would secure for him the protection and assistance of Ham- mond. In this, however, he was somewhat mistaken ; for Hammond was of a different religion from the chaplain, had married a daughter of the celebrated patriot, Hampden, and had been appointed governor of Carisbrook by Cromwell himself. This does not appear, however, to have entered into the royal consideration ; and indeed, in all things there appears to have been somewhat peculiarly untoward and al- most fatuous in the whole conduct of Charles. He arrived at Titchfield, accompanied by Mr. Ashburnham, Sir George Berkley, and some others, who had projected his flight from Hampton, and aided and accompanied him in the perform ance of it. When they arrived at Titchfield house, a seat of the earl of Southampton, they held a consultation as to where they should go next, and Ashburnham advised that, trusting to the relationship with his chaplain, as above stated, Charles should trust himself implicitly in the hands of Co lonel Hammond. In order to prepare the way for this, Ashburnham and Berkley went to the colonel at Carisbrook, and endeavoured to make terms of agreement; but Hammond replied, that, though he was willing to do the king all the ser vice in his power, he was only a subordinate officer, and must obey the commands of his superiors. He, however, came with them to the king ; and, on the 14th of November 1647, Charles accompanied them to Carisbrook, where Hammond, as governor, treated him with all possible respect. Imme- x 2"], [192, "156 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF diately, however, Hammond wrote to the Speaker of the Lords, stating that the king was in his hands, and that he waited orders respecting him ; and, at the same time, Charles Avrote a letter containing proposals for an accommodation with the Parliament. On the 14th of the ensuing month, the Parliament passed four bills, to which they wished to have the royal assent before concluding any treaty with Charles; and for this purpose they appointed a committee to lay them before the king. The Scotch commissioners, who frequently played Marplot during these disturbances, protested against those proceedings, resorted to the Isle of Wight, and offered terms of their own, more agreeable to the king than those of the English Parliament ; and upon this, Charles refused to give his assent to the bills. At the first intimation of Charles being in Carisbrook, the Parliament had ordered 5000-?. a year for the payment of his household expences; but, upon this breaking off of the negotiation, mainly owing to the questionable policy of the Scotch commissioners, the attendants of Charles were dismissed the castle, and he was detained a prisoner. The Scotch commissioners arrived on the 25th of December, and on the 29th an insurrection was made by Captain Burley in favour of the king, but it was unsuccessful ; and there is no doubt that, while Charles was professing fairly to negotiate, he was a party to this unsuc cessful insurrection, which ended in the condemnation and exe cution of Burley. Hammond, who appears to have been a man of great penetration, seemed to be aware of this ; for when the king, upon being put in confinement, demanded by whose order that step had been taken, Hammond replied, \" by the authority of both houses, and I suppose your mar jesty is not ignorant of the cause.\" The king professed ig norance ; but the governor told him that \" he plainly saw his majesty was actuated by other councils than stood for the good of the kingdom.\" Upon this, all negotiations ap pear to have been broken off, and Charles was detained a close prisoner in the castle. Not long after, however, the king made another attempt to escape, through the instrumentality of Osborne, who, re-"], [193, "157 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. commended by Hammond, had been appointed gentleman usher to the king. Either the previous disposition of this man, or the affability of Charles, made him interested in the cause of the monarch ; and he contrived to insert in the king's glove, which it was his office to present, a small slip of paper, expressing the devotedness of his loyalty. At first Charles was a little suspicious ; but the conduct of Osborne soon won his confidence. Rolfe, an officer in the garrison, proposed to Osborne and Edmund Worsley, to endeavour to entice Charles from the castle, under pretence, as he avowed, of murdering him, which would be an acceptable service to the Parliament. This was communicated to the king by Osborne, who encouraged the correspondence with Rolfe, in the hope of converting the intended murder into a real escape ; and some soldiers were procured to assist in the delivery of Charles from his captivity. Everything was prepared for removing the king from the castle, and taking him in a boat to some other place ; but, in attempting to make his way between the iron-bars of the window of his prison-house, Charles stuck fast, and with difficulty extri cated himself; and thus, the attempt to escape was, in the meantime, frustrated. The rest of the conspirators, how ever, who had been waiting to receive the king in case he should be able to descend from the window, contrived to escape unobserved ; and this permitted a new attempt to be made without suspicion. Charles was furnished with saws, by means of which to divide the bar which had impeded his former exit, and thus far he succeeded in his second attempt. In the meantime, however, Rolfe had found out that his proposal for murdering the king was to be converted into a means of escape for him; and therefore, he, with several soldiers well-armed, remained below at midnight, when the king had made the breach practicable, and was ready to escape. Rolfe immediately apprized the governor of what had taken place, upon which Osborne fled ; but another of the king's partizans was taken and imprisoned. Subse quently, Osborne stated the case to the House of Lords, and an indictment issued, charging Rolfe with having conspired"], [194, "158 HISTORICAL OUTLINE. to murder the king ; but the grand jury at Winchester ig nored the bill. After this, Charles was kept in more strict confinement than ever; and, as violent contentions had by this time arisen between the commons and the army, it was resolved, by the former, to open new negotiations with Charles, \u2014 Newport being the place appointed for the conference. Thither he was accordingly removed, and allowed the same liberty which he had engaged for at Hampton court; but was not to quit the Island pending the treaty, or for twenty- eight days after, without the authority of Parliament. The conference took place at Newport, on the 18th of September ; but it could not be brought to a satisfactory conclusion ; and the army, having by this time got the complete ascendancy, resolved to put an end to all future negotiations by seizing the person of the king. For this purpose, General Fairfax ordered Colonel Hammond to attend him at head-quarters ; and, in the meantime, deputed Colonel Eyres to resort to Newport, and take Charles into custody. Before Eyres ar- rived Charles had notice of this ; and some of his friends consulted with him on the subject, and earnestly advised him to make his escape ; but he, somewhat unwisely for his own safety, persisted in not being the first to break faith in the agreement he had made with the Parliament ; and, the result was, that he was hurried off to Hurst castle, and seven weeks afterwards brought to the block, \u2014 and, thus ended, perhaps, the most important political event of which the Isle of Wight has ever been the scene. Since the Restoration the governorship of the Isle of Wight has been held by various individuals, more as a post of honour and emolument than anything else ; and, what has occurred during this period may be considered as mere matter of detail, referring more to individual places, than to the whole Island. Therefore, this is the proper time at which to close our brief historical outline."], [195, "159 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS. CHAPTER VII. TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS. Though the Isle of Wight is considered part of Hamp- shire, and has its assizes, and till very lately had its quarter- sessions, at Winchester as the county town ; yet, in its par- liamentary representation, and in most other respects, it is quite as distinct as though it were entered on the rolls as a separate county. One can indeed see no good reason why it should be connected with Hampshire, other than that the expence of one assize, or circuit of the judges, may be less than that of two ; but whatever advantage this may be in the matter of county rates, it is both a waste of time, and an additional expence on the inhabitants of the Island, who have to bring both their parties, and their witnesses, to Winchester, and keep them at considerable expence; far greater, probably, than would be the cost of a separate assize for the Island. The holding of the quarter-sessions, or general sessions, at Winchester, nearly thirty miles distant by sea and land, was a still more palpable absurdity ; but of that, the spirit of the gentlemen of the Island has at length got the better, though only very recently. In a parliamentary point of view, the Island forms a third district of Hampshire, returning only one member, which,"], [196, "160 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF however, is a fair allowance in respect to its population. It is divided into the two hundreds or liberties, of East and West Medina, \u2014 the boundary of which is much better defined by nature than almost any boundary on the main-land. The entire line of separation from north to south, taking all the windings, is not above 14 miles long ; and of these the 10 northerly ones are formed by the river Medina and its es tuary, while the remainder proceeds in nearly a straight line from the eastern angle of the parish of Shorwell, across St. Catherine's, to Rocken-end. The polling places are Ryde, West Cowes, and Newport ; the latter being that at which the return is made. The two liberties do not differ greatly in extent of sur face ; for, though West Medina is considerably larger from east to west, its average breadth is not near so great. Both have also their share in the natural attractions ofthe Island, though these are of a very different character; West Me dina has its bold and caverned cliffs of chalk, and its chalky downs, with various bays ; and East Medina has its chalk downs, its southern and more lofty downs of the formation under the chalk, the romantic beauties of its Under-cliff, and also its bold and precipitous chalk cliffs at Culver. There are dry and naked uplands, and also very fertile fields, in both liberties ; but, taken upon the whole, East Medina is the more fertile of the two. This arises, partly from the nature of the soil, especially from the superabun dance of the clays and marls under the chalk ; but, it also in part arises from the less severe exposure of this division of the Island to the severe winds from the south-west, \u2014 much of it being protected by the downs, and the rest being at some distance from the sea. It is further worthy of re mark, that, in East Medina, the trees in the north part, when placed in exposed situations, have more of that leaning to the north-east than the trees, in similar situations, in the south ; and the pasturage upon the southern downs is here of richer quality than that of the chalk downs in the centre. The province of West Medina has no southern protection ;"], [197, "161 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. and therefore, the winds beat strongly, and the rains fall heavily, upon that portion of it which is between the chalk downs and the sea ; and therefore, though the greater part of this is naturally very strong land, it is liable to be too much soaked by the rains in wet seasons. The population of East Medina, by the census of 1831, was 15,523 ; and when the value of the rental was taken, it was 59,605/. By the same census, the population of West Medina, was 19,908; and, the valued rental, 67,331/. Putting these together, there \\ras a total population of the Island, of 35,341 ; and, the valued rental of the whole, as assessed in 1815, was 126,936/. This is at the rate of about 3/. Ils. 8d. of yearly rental for each individual, \u2014 that of the whole of Hampshire being about 3/. 12s. ; and that of all England, exclusive of Wales, about 3/. 15s. Some counties of England, however, have the rent much higher in proportion to the population than this \u2014 for example, the small but very rich county of Rutland has nearly 11. of valued rent for each inhabitant. It must be understood, however, that the rents valued in this assessment do not express the rents actually paid ; and that reductions in some places, and increases in others, have taken place since the year 1815. Comparing the total population of the Isle of Wight in 1831 with that in 1801, there has been an increase on the whole of 60 per cent., or at the rate of 2 per cent, per an num. Ten years have nearly elapsed since the census of 1831 was taken, and these 10 years will give an increase of 20 per cent, on the returns then made, which will make the present (1840) population of East Medina 18,627, of West Medina 23,890; and, consequently, of the whole Island 42,517. It is probable, however, that it is unfair to estimate the ratio of increase upon the average of the 30 years preceding 1831, because the influx of residents, put ting visitors entirely out of the question, has certainly been proportionably much greater than during any ten of the pre ceding years ; and the abolition of smuggling, together with i"], [198, "162 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF the increased resort of visitors, and tbe consequent augmenta tion of wealth, have, no doubt, considerably increased the resident population, so that we shall not be very much over the mark, if we rate the present population at 50,000 ; and, from the quantity of building, and the number of improve ments going on, 2*| per cent, per annum is not too high an estimate for the future increase. Indeed, from the many beauties and conveniences of the Island, and the ease and short time which are now required for arriving at it, this estimate of the future increase of its population is probably much too low ; and, if the Southampton docks are completed, and answer the reasonable expectations of their usefulness, it is very likely that many wealthy and influential persons, connected with the general commerce of the country, will make the Island the place of regular abode for their families. As many matters connected with the improvement of the Island, and the narrow seas between it and the main-land, are, however, only in progress or in project, one cannot with safety specluate concerning them. We shall therefore pro ceed to give a notice of the two liberties, devoting a section to each of them ; and, as it is the more populous, and contains the capital of the Island, we shall begin with WEST MEDINA. This liberty is nearly in the form of a triangle, having all its three sides of about equal length. It seems to have been the part of the Island which was earliest inhabited, at least to any great extent, and it contains the capital of the Island; Carisbrook, which was the seat of the governors; and the boroughs of Yarmouth and Newtown, which, how ever, had long been mere property boroughs, and lost their franchise at the passing of the Reform bill. It contains in all sixteen parishes ; and, as already stated, the gross popu lation may be about 23,890. We shall take the parishes in their order, from the point nearest the main-land : \u2014 Northwood. This is a large parish, of a triangular form, extending about three miles and a half along the Medina;"], [199, "163 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. about the same distance along the Solent ; and rather more along the inland boundary southward, where it abuts, for the greater part of its length, upon what used to be the royal forest of Parkhurst, and which is now considered part of the parish of Newport. The high road from Cowes' harbour to Newport passes through the entire length of this parish from north to south; and the parish church is on the left-hand of this road, in proceeding towards New port, about two miles to the southward of Cowes. The slope of the country toward the Medina is pleasant, with an alternation of woods, fields, and meadows; but the cen tral part of the parish, though generally speaking cultivated, is rather bleak, being exposed to the south-west winds, which beat upon it through the Solent. The church of this parish was a chapel of ease to Carisbrook, until the reign of Henry VIII, at which time parochial privileges were granted to it, and it was exempted from contributing to the repairs of Carisbrook church. The title still, however, belonged to the vicar of Carisbrook, who is at the same time rector of this parish. The valued rental of this parish, in 1815, was 11,275/., being the highest valuation of any parish in the Island; and the population, in 1831, was 4491. The increase of the whole Island, since that time, would give to this parish, in 1839, a population of about 5389 ; but as West Cowes has increased very considerably in importance, from the in flux of visitors, the celebrity of the Yacht Club, and other circumstances, the permanent population, independently of the summer visitors, may now be considered as not less than 5000. West Cowes is the most convenient landing-place and port in the Island, as the set of the tide, both eastward and westward, makes slack- water in the offing: in conse quence of this, Cowes' roads immediately off the village, is a favorite anchorage for vessels waiting a fair wind. This gives considerable employment to ship-chandlers in the vil lage; and there is also a good deal of ship-building carried y2"], [200, "164 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF on. Vessels of considerable burden, and, we believe, even ships of the line, have been built here; but there are not the requisite apparatus for masting ; and therefore the larger yachts have to go to Portsmouth for that purpose. The establishment of the grand rendezvous of the Yacht Club at this port, gives it a permanent interest, as the elegance of this species of craft, and the character of the parties to whom they belong\u2014 including gentlemen of the first respec tability, with Lord Yarborough at their head, give a tone to the place during the summer season, much higher than the size and situation of the town itself would lead one to expect. These craft are the ne plus ultra of vessels, both in their mould and their rigging ; and their action in the water is equally safe and beautiful; so that, when they are out in a mackarel breeze, they move like \" things of life \" upon the waters. The approach to Cowes is very fine, as the different buildings and villas rise, as it were, on terraces, with tufted trees between, as though town and country were blended together. In the town itself, there is not much to admire, for the streets are very narrow ; but they are well paved, and much has been done of late years to improve them. The bathing ground, to the north-eastward of the town, is extremely convenient, as the beach and water are remarkably clean ; and a bathe can be obtained in all states of the tide, with nearly equal convenience and ad vantage. Cowes was an insignificant fishing hamlet until the time of Henry VIII, when a castle or fort was erected, which still remains, near the entrance ofthe harbour. In times of peace, this fort is of no importance ; but, during war, it would be an efficient defence against a privateer, though certainly not against a regular squadron ; and, from its posi tion, it would protect vessels anchored in the roads from any hostile attack ; as the battery is in the form of a crescent, and completely commands the roadstead. There are good inns and commodious lodging-houses in the town, together with an assembly room, and all the usual accommodations of a watering-place. The hill above the town, which, though"], [201, "EAST COWES CASTLE, 'AT OF TSE E\u00c6RL OF SKA KNUU"], [202, ""], [203, "165 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. not high, has rather a bold escarpment, is ornamented by many pleasant villas, conspicuous among which appears the residence of G. H. Ward, Esq. ; and the villa styled Egypt, near the bathing ground, is in a charming situation, com manding a great extent of sea views. The town, or rather the village, is not strictly speaking a parish; but it has a church, the living of which is a curacy in the gift of the vicar of Carisbrook; who, as we have already men tioned, is rector of Northwood, in which parish West Cowes is situated. This village contains, indeed, a great number ofthe inhabitants ofthe parish ; and upon the whole, it is perhaps the most important maritime spot in the Island. It is the grand port; for, though barges can ascend the Medina to Newport at high-water, all sea-borne goods re quired in the Island are, generally speaking, imported here. Ryde, though perhaps more populous, and certainly more showy and better built, and also nearer to Portsmouth \u2014 which is a great consideration in war times, but in war times only, is much less adapted for the import of heavy goods into the Island generally. It is further from Newport by about three miles ; there is no water-carriage of any description ; and the carriage road, though good, is very hilly. The tide also ebbs far back from the shore at Ryde \u2014 so far, as to render it necessary to have a pier, more than a quarter of a mile long, for the mere accommodation of the passage ; and thus, the establishment of anything like a ship harbour, even for a coasting craft of the lightest burden, is out of the question. At Cowes, the circumstances are very dif ferent ; and therefore it is, and must continue to be, the port of the Island. If such are the natural advantages of Cowes' harbour, and the barge navigation of the Medina to Newport, the former, as a landing for passengers, must have received great advantages from the London and South ampton railway. It would be difficult to imagine a more agreeable sea- trip than the passage between Southampton and this port. There are the facilities of the sea, and the prospects of the land the whole way ; and, with the excep-"], [204, "166 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF tion of crossing the main-channel of the Solent, the weather must be stormy indeed, if there is any annoyance even to the most timid and squeamish. The distance is only about fourteen miles, and of this the greater part is like enjoying one's self on the artificial canal of a pleasure-ground, only the scale is a little more magnificent ; but, notwith standing this, the scenery right and left is not less fine. At certain times of the year the water is literally thronged with medus\u0153, which float along, stratum superstratum, having some resemblance to half-melted flakes of snow. If it is the dusk of evening, and one is rowing or rowed along, then the more minute animals, which are highly phos phorescent, are put in motion by the splash of the oars, and also at the bows of the boat, so that the water appears to be self-illuminated with the most beautiful, and the most subdued and quiet, light \u2014 a light, however, which tells all around, and makes the sea cheerful amid the darkness of the night. Where there are so many marine fascinations, and the roadstead and harbour are so easily made and so safe, one forgets that the village of Cowes is somewhat homely ; and loses the mere consideration of streets and buildings, in ad miration of the locality of the village, which land and water appear to have conspired to render as pleasing as possible. These are, no doubt, the circumstances which have attracted the Yacht Club to Cowes, as their grand head-quarters ; and while they continue, of which there is not the smallest doubt, the place will always be gay in the summer months ; and this, with the resort of shipping to the roads and the harbour, and the arrival and departure of passengers, to say nothing of the numbers and respectability of the summer visitors, must always render Cowes an interesting and flou rishing place ; \u2014 and from the brief time which is now re quisite in passing between Cowes and London, either the one way or the other, the village must greatly increase ; while, though the present streets, which are modelled upon the old fishing village, are anything but handsome, or even"], [205, "167 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. commodious, there are delightful sites for villas and streets upon the beautifully wooded slope of the hills. Newport is, taking the border parishes of West Me dina, in order southward, the next that claims our notice. This is not one original parish, but has, like that of North wood, been formed out of the once very extensive parish of Carisbrook, where, in the olden time, there was a conside rable town, while the present Newport was an insignificant hamlet. When, however, better times came round, and the inhabitants of places were not trammeled up to seek defence under the walls of castles, but left free to follow out and improve the natural advantages of places, whatever these might be, the situation of Newport gave it the advan tage over the present village, to which it had been a ham let, and it increased as a town, while Carisbrook diminished as a village. Ecclesiastical establishments and institutions have, however, little connexion with the physical and social improvements of mankind; and thus, they remain much as they were in the thick darkness of the middle ages, amid the light, the liberty, and the general improvement, of modern times. Accordingly, the town of Newport, the capital of the Isle of Wight, and one of the neatest and most thriving towns in the British dominions, remains, to this day, only a curacy of the parish of Carisbrook, having its minister the mere nominee of the vicar of that parish, though it has been found necessary, of late years, to build another church, or chapel, of the establishment, to accommo date the worshippers of the place. In former times, when Parkhurst was a royal forest, we believe that there was not one foot of land that could, in strict propriety, be called the parish of Newport; but since that forest was, in part, enclosed and divided, we believe that it has become the nominal parish, though it is situated without the parliamen tary boundaries of the borough. This is an irregular patch of land, abutting on the left bank of the Medina, for nearly a mile from the town of Newport northwards. It extends about three miles from east to west, and is rather less than"], [206, "168 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF two miles in average breadth from north to south. It has the parish of Northwood on the north ; a detached portion of that of Shalfleet on the west ; Carisbrook, and a patch of St. Nicholas, which is the parish of the castle chapel \u2014 now little used, on the south ; and the Medina on the east. Much of it is still covered with furze ; and, besides Albany barracks, which stand characteristically monumental of the late war, it contains the general House of Industry, or Poors' house, for the whole Island, \u2014 a judiciously-managed esta blishment, which was completed, or at all events instituted, so long ago as 1772 ; and a Penitentiary for the reclaiming of delinquents, chiefly, we believe, juvenile ones, which is of much more recent establishment. The Poors'-house, or \" House of Industry,\" as it is somewhat quaintly styled, has been found to work well, both for the comfort and morality of the poor, and for the economy of those by whom the said poor must be supported. It is a plain building, as all such buildings ought to be, situated a little to the eastward of the road, about three-quarters of a mile from Newport; but, although thus appropriately plain, it is remarkably well suited to its intended purpose ; is judici ously managed ; and, as we have said, has done a great deal of good. The penitentiary has not yet had sufficient trial ; but probably it will turn out, that the good effected will, as in other cases of a similar kind, bear but a low ratio to the expectations or the costs. If half the sums which are laid out in Britain, for the attempted but unsuccessful reclaiming of the depraved, were judiciously laid out for the prevention of depravity, the country would be all the better for it ; but the analogy holds in morals as in medicine \u2014 he who performs a great cure is a great man ; while he who merely preserves a healthy state has neither honour nor reward. In the present pacific state of the world, the barracks, which resemble a little town, stand idle amid topping grass, and must be kept in repair at considerable expence; but they are ready in case a war should ensue, \u2014 and one may come, although there is no present prospect of it."], [207, "169 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. BOROUGH OF NEWPORT. There is no toAvn more advantageously situated for general intercourse with the district of which it is the capital, than Newport. The ground on which it is built is not greatly elevated above the tideway of the Medina; and, while the site is remarkably dry, there is excellent drainage, and the streets are particularly clean and com- modious. It is, as it were, in the centre of a natural amphitheatre, with swelling hills rising gently and gradually on all sides, and yet separated from each other by various passes, which render the road comparatively easy. The most definite of those passes, are toward the southern part of the Island, where the distances are, upon the whole, the longest, and the roads which diverge from the borough as a centre, bear no inconsiderable resemblance to the radii of a spider's web. Of these roads, there are two to the north, one to West Cowes on the left bank of the Medina, and another to East Cowes on the right, both of them twining over the heights, and affording delightful views of the es- tuary and the surrounding scenery. These roads are of about equal length \u2014 four miles and a half each ; the first leading from the bridge across the Carisbrook stream, at the middle of the north side of the town, and the other from Copping's bridge, at the east end of the High-street, which street intersects the town in nearly a direct line from east to west. A little beyond the bridge, the eastern roads continue in a single line, for about three-quarters of a mile, and then diverge like the branches of a tree. Of these, there are four principal branches, the most northerly through Wootten, and by Binstead to Ryde, which, how- ever, continues onward to St. Helen's. The second proceeds to the southward of this, leading through the thickly- wooded country, and keeping an average distance of about a mile and a half from the north coast, until it unites with the former near St. Helen's. It crosses the Ryde road southward, at the second mile-stone, and the way thence is z"], [208, "170 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF clear, either to Ryde, or through Brading and Shanklin, to the back of the Island. The third branch proceeds by Longlane, across Arreton, Mesley, Knighton, and Brading downs, and meets the east road a little to the south of Bra ding. A fourth, which is a continuation of the West Cowes' road through St. James's square and Node hill, crosses Shide bridge, where a branch to the left crosses the downs to Ar reton, and is continued till it meets the coast road, half a mile south of the barracks at Sandown bay. The main branch passes near the right bank of the Medina, but has a branch to the left, below the downs at Blackwater bridge, a little beyond the two-mile-stone from Newport. At Rukely, near the four-mile-stone, it branches again, \u2014 the left-hand branch proceeding by Godshill, in a winding direction, to the eastward of Appuldurcomb, and cross the downs to the Undercliff, to Steephill, and Ventnor ; while at Aubens, half a-mile to the north of Godshill, another branch proceeds directly south to Whitwell, and then turning to the east ward, reaches the Undercliff at St. Lawrence. From Rukely, the main, or central branch, extends southward across Black down, by Niton, to the Undercliff, near Sandrock hotel, but sends branches eastward to the Whitwell road, and west ward to Chale; and all these branches communicate with each other by cross-roads, at the southern extremities. A third main branch of road leads from Castle-hold south westward, through the village of Carisbrook, and along the valley of the Carisbrook stream, to Shorewell, where it turns westward, and traverses the countries south of the chalk downs by Brixton, Mottiston, and Brook, and so on to Freshwater gate. At New village, a little to the south west of Newport, a branch of this road proceeds directly southward, between Carisbrook castle and Mountjoy ; and passing Gatcombe, and near Kingston, leads on to Chale. Another branch leads to the right at Carisbrook, and passes under Bowcomb and Apes downs, by Swanston to Cal bourne, at which there is another point of divergence ; one road proceeding southward to Mottiston, another westward"], [209, "THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 171 to Freshwater, and two others to Yarmouth \u2014 a southern one by Shorley, and a northern one by Shalfleet. The last named branch of road, diverges from the Cowes' road at the north part of the town, and joins the last two of the pre viously-mentioned ones, the one by Watchingwell, and the other by Newton. For more minute particulars we must refer to the map ; but, from what Ave have stated, it will be easily seen that no town commands or has access to the surround ing country, by more numerous roads, than diverge from New port to all parts of the Island. In general, too, these roads, and also most of the country roads which connect the proxi mate ones at short distances, are of the best materials and kept in the finest order; and, though there is, generally speaking, enough of ascent or descent to prevent the stag nation of the heaviest rain upon the road, the hills are rarely very steep. We have mentioned these particulars, in order to show how admirably Newport is situated for ready communication with all parts of the Island, and how impossible it would be for any other spot in the Island to attempt supplying its place. One thing only is wanting to render the system of communication complete ; and that is, to connect Newport with the sea, and so with the main-land and the rest of the world, by a regular navigation. When the river Medina is seen at high-water, especially high-water of spring-tides, when there is a considerable breadth and six feet in depth, a stranger would naturally suppose that this most desirable communication is already in existence. Such, however, is not the fact ; for, at high-water of neap-tides, there are only two feet at Newport quay ; and, for the greater part of the tide, there may be said to be no water at all. The Medina itself is a mere brook, and can conduce little or nothing to the purposes of navigation ; and besides, the water of it is appropriated to the mills above the quay always. In its present state, therefore, though barges and other craft, draw ing little water, can make their way to Newport at certain times of the tide, these times are limited; and when the z2"], [210, "172 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF neap-tides are low and the south-west does not bring much set of water up Channel, the flood-tide hardly reaches the quay at all. There are two ways in which this might be remedied. The first is by excavating the upper part of the bed of the river, so as to obtain a depth of water, not only at high-water of all tides, but at all times of the tide ; be cause this last would be indispensable, in any attempt to con vert Newport into a regular landing place for steam-boat passengers. For about two miles and a half from Cowes, there is at present sufficient depth for steamers ; and, there fore, the project for obtaining the requisite depth, without having recourse to lockage, resolves itself into the deepening of about two miles and a half more. In point of absolute expence, this would not be a very serious matter, consider ing the advantages that would result from it. It is now, we believe, under judgment of engineers, and therefore, we would not be understood to offer any very positive opinion concerning it; but, it is probable, that the first cost of a well-constructed channel of the necessary depth, with the requisite quay- walls, slips, and jetties, would not cost more than 20,000/., \u2014 even, taking those items of expence, which engineers are often disposed to conceal, lest they should frighten their employers at the outset. There are, how ever, some doubts as to the permanence of a work of this kind; because, though the mill-ponds above operate as cess-pools, both on the Medina and on the western branch, there is likely to be some silting-up in a muddy channel of so small dimensions, where the current of the water must necessarily be slow, and the out-draught by the ebbing-tide quite insignificant. In consequence of this apprehended silting-up, it has been proposed to abandon the project of deepening, at least in great part, and to substitute for it, a lock immediately above Cowes' harbour which shall, at all times, retain the depth of water required. The expence of constructing this lock, with its dam or wear, would perhaps not be greater, and probably it would be less, than the ex pence of excavation ; and the water thus retained, would be"], [211, "173 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. more ornamental, and would have all the placidity of an in land harbour \u2014 in fact, it would be one gigantic wet-dock of nearly five miles in length ; and with this understanding of it, it might be rendered as valuable to the port of Cowes, as to that of Newport, as Cowes is at present only a tide harbour. The main channel at Cowes is of very conside rable depth, being 21 feet at neap-tides, and from 24 to 26 at spring-tides ; and if the sill of the lock were adapted to those depths, any vessel whatever might be received here, and the foundation might be laid for ship-building establish ments upon a far more extensive scale than has hitherto been the case. But there is a bar in the way of thus shut ting up the waters of the Medina, in the two tide-mills of East and West Medina, which would of course be rendered useless by the execution of the project, and the owners of them would look for probably more compensation than the scheme, even if successfully carried into execution, would be able to afford. This is prospective however, at the time when we write, and it is also speculation, not fact; there fore we shall pursue it no further, although it is a matter deeply connected with the local interests of Newport, and through them with those of the whole Island. Newport must not be confounded with those villages, or towns, of the Island, which owe their importance solely to being places of fashionable resort. They, no doubt, dur ing the time they continue fashionable, increase much faster than such a place as Newport can be expected to increase. But of all dependencies, that upon fashion is the most capricious, as may be understood by any one who compares the present condition of Bath with what it was half-a-cen tury ago, when, to be out of Bath during the gay season, which season extended over great part of the year, was almost the same as to be out of the world. Cheltenham is, however, the place now, and Bath, sits comparatively solitary in her widowhood, and her weeds of woe ; and the same may happen, indeed must happen, to every place which de pends upon the capricious dictates of the most changeable"], [212, "174 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF of all goddesses \u2014 prone as the whole of the tribe are to change, and fond as they are of novelty, whilst it deserves the name, but not longer. As compared with places on the coast of the Island, \u2014 Ryde, Ventnor, or whatever else it may be, Newport has a home-stability, which makes it in- dependent of the fluctuations to which these are subject. It is supported by the people of the Island, who resort to it as their central and appropriate mart for the sale of whatever they have to sell, and the purchase of whatever they may require. Hence, its tradesmen and its establish- ments have a home-support, and depend upon those who are permanently in the Island, much more than upon occasional visitors, who will continue to resort to the Island as long as it is the fashionable place, but not longer. In conse- quence of this, the progress of building, and of population, may be slower in Newport than they are in places of more fashionable and ephemeral character; but they are at the same time far more sure. Take away the visitors, and many of those places would speedily fall into ruin and de- cay ; do the same by Newport, and it is doubtful if the re- sult would be total abandonment of any house within the borough, or its parliamentary liberty. Though well adapted for the reception of strangers, in respect of inns, excellent markets, and every other accommodation, conducive to human comfort, Newport is essentially a domestic town \u2014 - the heart and centre of the Isle of Wight; The markets, the courts, the assembly rooms, and all the other public establishments in the borough, have their chief reference to the Isle of Wight; and though fashion should change, and the attractions of the Island should cease to draw such crowds of company as now throng to it in increasing num bers every year, Newport would go on increasing at the average ratio of county towns, just as if no such event had taken place. The streets of Newport are laid out with much regularity, the largest ones lying east and west, with cross ones north and south, dividing the area into checquers. Perhaps the"], [213, "175 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. two principal ones are those which connect the great roads : St. James's-street from Cowes' road, to that which leads by Niton, to the Undercliff and High-street, which connects the Ryde road with the road to Carisbrook and the western roads which diverge there. These two streets divide the town into four quarters ; and though the quarters are of unequal size, and the other streets of different lengths, the plan of the town is remarkably well adapted for the circulation of air, for cleanliness, and for comfort. The portion of the High street westward of the crossing of St. James' is termed the Castle-hold; and when St. James' ascends the rising ground on the south of the town, it is termed Node hill. Parallel to the High-street, and at a little distance south of it, Pyle street extends in a direct line from the Carisbrook road to the Medina, and south of this there is South-street, still in the same direction, on the east of St. James's-street, and Scirrot-lane on the west of the same ; northward of the High-street, there are Lugley-street, parallel and at the same distance from it as Pyle-street, and Crocker-street, which forms an angle with St. James's-street, within a short distance of the bridge on the Cowes' road. Besides St. James's-street, Holyrood-street crosses from South-street to the West Medina, in the eastern part of the town. This last-named street, and the eastern part of High-street, di vide off a quadrant of the town, the circular side of which is occupied by Sea-street, toAvard the river, and from the angle at which the market-place and town-hall are situated ; Quay-street divides the quadrant in a curve, in the direction of the Medina. The last is a wide street, leading directly to the centre of the town, from the wharfs as at present existing ; and, were the estuary made navigable, the en trance into Newport by this street, would be clean and plea sant. It appears to have been the original intention to have the square near the centre of the town ; and the wide part of St. James's-street, is called St. James's square. It is spacious ; and the reading rooms, subscription library, and museum, which are contained in a handsome piazzaed build-"], [214, "176 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF ing, at the angle formed by this square and the High-street, are equally useful and ornamental. To the eastward of the checquer, of which this building forms an angle, there is another square of larger dimensions, with the parish church in the centre ; but the north and south of it are much en- croached upon by buildings. It is here that the corn mar- ket is held ; the market for poultry, green-grocery, and other country produce, is at the angle formed by High-street and Quay-street, and the town-house, which is a handsome build- ing of the Ionic order, is erected over it. The corn market is well supplied, although the old practice of a pitch market, that is of bringing the grain for sale with the chance of having to take it back again, has given place to the more rational and convenient method of selling by sample. The cattle market, which is held every second Wednesday, is well supplied, and the beef is of excellent quality ; the graziers being in the habit of purchasing the small breed of Scotch oxen, which fatten readily and most healthily, on the rich meadows of the south of the Island. The common culinary market, as it may be termed, is also abundantly supplied, and poultry especially, is excellent. In short, there is no town in Britain, in which vivres can be obtained of better quality, or more reasonably than in Newport. The surface-water is partially tinged with iron ; but very pure water is obtained by sinking wells to a depth of from 100 to 150 feet, according to the situation. It will be borne in mind that Newport is on the gravel; and that the chalk is only a little way off, at Mountjoy and Carisbrook, to the southward ; and between the gravel and this chalk, there is a stratum of stiff clay, which crops out at the brick fields near Shide bridge. This stratum of course intercepts all the water which percolates and filters down though the sand and gravel; and as, where a well is opened, the balance is the pressure of sand and gravel versus that of water, the water rises readily in the wells\u2014 as it is found at Albany barracks, where from a depth of 280 feet, it stands to within 30 feet of the surface. If boring and tub-"], [215, ""], [216, "_ / ll i: >._. H III,,. \u25a0;,.../,, h,l.l,..l.,,l /\u25a0\u201e\u25a0 il.. Il../,ri.l.,i !\u201e\u25a0 I,:,/,,,,.."], [217, "177 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. ing were substituted for the common mode of well sinking, there is no doubt that the water would rise to the surface, or even above it, as it is found to do in the valley of the Thames, where the strata are similar. The church of Newport is not very handsome; but it has a venerable air, arising, perhaps, as much from the crum bling nature of the stone as from its antiquity, and increased by a partial covering of ivy, which gives freshness to a structure in the centre of a town ; and this church has not the customary offence of a burying-ground around it. The tower is lofty, and embattled, and of itself gives a marked character to the town. The interior is plain, with the ex ception of an elaborately carved pulpit, bearing emblematical figures, texts of scripture, and other labours of the chisel, and it has the date 1638. The interior is not much disfigured by monuments. In the south aisle there is a well-executed one in alabaster, representing Sir Edward Hervey, who was governor of the Island, from 1565 to 1582 \u2014 dight in complete armour. This captain appears to have been an excellent man, though he had his foibles; for he is the governor of whom it is reported that he gave a lamb for every live hare brought into the Island. Another, and humbler one, on the steps leading to the altar, is to the memory of an unfortunate princess, Elizabeth second daughter of Charles I. This princess, who had been kept in obscurity at Carisbrook, and was intended to be bound apprentice to a tradesman, died the 8th of December, 1540, in the 15th year of her age. She appears to have been buried in the same obscurity in which she lived ; and the leaden coffin containing her remains was not discovered till 1793. The parish next to the south of Newport, and clerically including that town, is Carisbrook, which once extended, the king's forest excepted, to the northern extremity of the Island. It stretches rather more than four miles form north-east to south-west, having the brook from which the name is derived in the centre ; and for two miles south of Newport to where A A"], [218, "178 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF it borders on Gatcomb, \u2014 the Medina forms the eastern boun dary. The surface of the parish is beautifully diversified, the vale from Newport upwards being exceedingly rich ; the eastern part toward the Medina of the same character ; and great part of the downs, with the exception perhaps of the ridge of Bowcombe down, in the western part of the parish, susceptible of cultivation. The north-western boundary is formed by patches of St. Nicholas and Shalfleet parishes ; the west by Calbourne ; the south by Shorwell, a patch of St. Nicholas, and Gatcomb ; and the east by Arreton and Whip pingham. The valued rental ofthe parish, exclusive of New port, is 1389/., and the population 632. The village of Carisbrook is one mile south-west of Newport, in a rich and pleasant part of the valley, and having a mall or elevated foot-path for great part of the way. The village itself is well built ; and there are some delightful villas in its neigh bourhood, the most tasteful of which is that belonging to Mr. Abraham Clark, one of the most talented and public spirited gentlemen of the Island. As this village is completely over looked by the castle, which stands close by on the east or left hand side of the brook, it once drew much of the population of the neighbourhood, as they could take shelter within the castle in case of invasion. Baldwin, fifth earl of Devon, granted a market and fair to it in the year 1257 ; but since Newport rose to such consequence, the market of Carisbrook has been discontinued, and the population of the village fell off for a long time, though at present it is on the increase. The church is a handsome building, on a rising ground to the right-hand of the road in proceeding from Newport; and it is surrounded, within the church-yard wall, by a colon nade of limes, cut level at the tops and into arches between the boles, which somehow or other do not look quite so ugly as such artificial deformations of trees generally do. The church itself is of Norman architecture, and was built in the eleventh century. It has once consisted of a nave, north and south aisles, and a chancel, and Avas originally the chapel of the priory established here ; but, in the reign of Eliza-"], [219, "I; 1.1 OF WIGHT in,,.. ..."], [220, ""], [221, "179 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. beth, Sir Francis Walsingham, lessee of the priory, and, as such, conservator of the chancel, succeeded in persuading the people to pull it down ; but whether the north aisle was included in this demolition is not said. The south aisle is separated by pillars and Norman arches, and similar arches are still visible in the north wall, though their apertures are built up. In the church there is a fragment of a very rude monument, apparently of an abbot with book and pastoral staff, and among the other monuments there is a wooden one to the memory of \" the right worthy William Keeling, Esquire, groom of the chamber to our sovereign lord, King James, general of the Hon. the East India Adventurers, whither he was thrice by them employed.\" Among other relics there is an old gun, the inscription upon which intimates, that \" this falcon,\" as it was termed, was made by Robert and John Owine, in 1549. The living of Carisbrook, the most valuable in the Island, possessing the great tithes, and the tithes of the other parishes formerly belonging to the priory, has been in the gift of Queen's college, Oxford, since the reign of Charles I. When Doomsday Book Avas compiled the parish was styled Berecombe or Bowcomb ; it was a royal manor, and the church belonged to the abbey of De Lira. At that time however it included the parishes of Northwood, Newport, Kingston, and Chale, and thus ex tended from sea to sea ; as is now the case with the parish of Newchurch in East Medina. William Fitz-Osborne founded the priory here in 1086, and granted it and its church and chapels, with the churches of Whippingham, Arreton, Newchurch, Godshill, Niton, and Freshwater, to the abbey of Lira in Normandy. Ed ward III seized it as alien, and gave it to Mount Gress in Yorkshire; and Henry IV restored it to Lira. Henry V seized it again, and gave it to the abbey of Sheen at Richmond, in whose possession it remained till the dissolu tion, and the abbey lands, which were considerable, have be come private property. Close by the priory there was an Augustine chapel for lepers. Few vestiges of the priory now aa 2"], [222, "180 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF remain, except some ruins in the vicinity of the church. Carisbrook castle is one of the sights ; and, as such, it is worthy the notice of every visitor. Gatcomb, abutting on the left bank of the Medina, lies in a notch in the south-east part of Carisbrook, and is nearly one mile and a half in each direction. The surface of this little parish is beautifully diversified; and Gatcomb park is a pleasant residence. The parish is rich for its extent and population: the valued rental being 2789/., and the popu lation 263. Gatcomb church is a handsome old structure, with a neat embattled and pinnacled tower. In this church there is a curious figure, in a recumbent position, carved in oak, with a cherub on the upper side of the head, dressed .out in a round wig. Antiquaries say that this represents the founder of the church ; but the country people call it St. Radigund. Although it is extremely rude, the style of the niche containing it would imply that it is not very ancient. St. Nicholas, which is the parish of the chapel to Caris brook castle, consists of a few patches of land, scattered here and there through the Island \u2014 one on the south of Gatcomb, another in the valley of the Carisbrook stream, and a third between the north-west of Carisbrook parish and the forest, or parish of Newport. The valued rental 1615/., and the population 317. On the south-east of Gatcomb, and the little patch of St. Nicholas, there lies a detached portion of Carisbrook, rang ing along the left bank of the Medina, for about two miles from the boundary of Gatcomb, and having Godshill on the east, and Shorwell on the south-west. Shorwell lies to the south of Carisbrook parish, and be gins near the downs, about the fourth mile-stone from New port southwards; and the parish church and village are situated immediately under the downs, a mile further to the south. From the south-west corner of Carisbrook parish, Shorwell extends, in nearly a straight line, for three miles, to the point and rocks at Atherfield, which, form the boundary between Chale and Brixton bays. The north-east side,"], [223, "181 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. which is bounded by Carisbrook, and the patches of St. Nicholas, is about four miles; and the south-east side, bounded by Chale and a patch of Brixton, is nearly the same ; but within this irregular triangle, toward the south east part of it, there is included the small parish of King ston. Shorwell, though in part consisting of downs, is a rich, beautiful, and rather a populous parish \u2014 the valued rental being 4690/., and the population about 700. The approach to Shorwell, by the main road, is through a very deep ravine cut in the downs, over which there is suspend ed a rustic bridge of great beauty. This bridge belongs to the ornamental grounds of Northcourt, a most delightful residence, at present the property of Sir J. Willoughby Gordon, Bart. This place is richly wooded; and there is in the grounds a copious spring of very pure water, from which the place takes its name. The church of Shorwell consists of three aisles, and is very low in proportion to its length. The tower is also low, but it is terminated by a spire. There are many monuments of the Leigh family in the north aisle ; and in the chancel there is a flat stone, with a brass consisting of an effigy about 20 inches high, which supplicates prayers, in the charity of the reader, for the soul of Richard Bethel, vicar ofthe parish, who died 1518. Kingston is one of the smallest parishes in the Island, si tuated among the high and sandy grounds, and having brooks flowing from it both to the Medina and the Channel. Its valued rental is 1058/., and the population 83. It is bounded everywhere by Shorwell, except for about half-a mile on the south-east, where a tongue of the parish of Chale extends northward between it and Godshill. Chale is the remaining parish in this belt across the widest part of West Medina. Its eastern boundary, coin ciding with that of the liberty, is nearly straight, and about four miles in length, from the Medina in the north to the sea at Rocken-end in the south. Its sea boundary is nearly three miles ; in which are contained part of the land-slip in 1799, the great chasm of Black-gang chine, and Chale bay,"], [224, "182 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF so fatal to mariners. The surface of this parish is very va ried ; it contains no mansion of any consequence, and the population is rather greater in proportion to the rent, than in some of the neighbouring parishes, \u2014 the rent being 2913/., and the population 544. The greater part of this parish is destitute of trees, and exposed to all the violence of the south-west winds. The church \u2014 which is in a bleak and ex posed situation, but commanding a full view of the terrors of that sea, of whose fatal effects the church-yard records but too many evidences \u2014 consists of two aisles, and has an embattled tower at the west end. It was built by Hugh de Vernon in the reign of Henry I. The view eastward is confined by the high grounds of St. Catherine's ; but west ward, there is a fine view of the western cliffs, and of the coast beyond, as far as the Isle of Portland. We shall next take some notice of the parishes below the southern downs, of which there are three in succession westward, Brixton, Mottiston, and Brook, \u2014 only a portion of Shalfleet extends southward between the two latter. The road through these parishes turns off to the right of Shor well, in coming from Newport, immediately at the south boundary of the park at Northcourt ; thence it passes through the villages of Limerston, Brixton, Mottiston, Brook, and Compton, and so on to Freshwater ; but there are passages between the downs, one a little to the westward of Brixton, and another at Brook. All these parishes have good sheep pastures on the downs, though many of the downs admit of cultivation to the very summit, and the low country toward the sea is very rich ; though, as it is in general stiff clay or marl, it is very heavy in winter ; and wet seasons, or exceedingly dry ones, do not answer well with it, as it gets miry and cold in the former, and binds and champs in the latter. Brixton is the largest parish ; it consists of two por tions : \u2014 an irregular triangle, having Shorwell on the east, Calbourn and Mottiston on the north-west, and Brixton bay on the south-west ; and a smaller portion lying to the south-"], [225, ""], [226, "J si,. 1.1 1 OT WZG-HT WflT\u00a9F1 OJ V ii CH , ISLE OF WIGHT \u25a0 M.r.l /', /. /' Ct ,.r si./.l,, /,...."], [227, "183 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. east, between part of the parishes of Chale and Shorwell. The sea-cliff along the coast of this parish is steep, and the beach is accessible only by the chines or gullies which have been formed by the perennial brooks, or by occasional runs of water during the autumnal and winter floods. These chines have little beauty or interest. They are six in number, \u2014 Jackman's, Water-gate, Ship-ledge, Barnes, Cow leaze, Grange, and Chilton. Toward the coast the surface is in some parts more elevated than that farther in-land toward the downs, and two streams, one from the pass at Mottiston mill on the north-west, and the other from Shorwell, meet a little below Brixton. The valued rental of the parish is 4089/., and the population about 650. This parish once formed part of Calbourne, which was the property of the bishop of Winchester at and before the Conquest. In those days it was an extensive and valuable possession, and appears to have been pretty thickly inhabited and well cultivated. Besides twenty-five plough lands, there were two mills, a considerable extent of meadow, and pannage in the woods for twenty hogs. This, however, included the whole stretch across the Island, with the town of Newtown, and the different creeks of Newtown bay on the north ; but even including these, the Doomsday estimate shows that the value was considerable at and before the time of the Conquest. At present, the patronage of the church, which is a rectory, is in the gift of the bishop. The church is ra ther a neat structure, though homely, and as such, appro priate to its situation. It consists of a nave, a south aisle, and a chancel ; and the marks of arches in the north wall indicate that there once had been a north aisle ; the tower is neat, but not lofty, and terminates in a spire. Within the church-yard, and to the westward of the church, there is a very venerable yew tree, consisting of a vast number of young stems, which have sprung from the top of an old and hollow trunk. There are several stately trees in the neigh bourhood ; and altogether, Brixton is a pleasant rural place."], [228, "184 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF Mottiston, the next parish to the west, extends only to the summit of the down of the same name, which is not much more than a mile and a quarter, and its average breadth, from east to west, is not above a mile, or its line of sea-coast above half-a-mile ; and the latter is unapproachable in consequence of the rocks. The strata here consist of rich and sandy loam, deeply mixed with iron, but still it is fertile, and answers better in rainy seasons than the more clayey soils. Considering its small size, the rental of the parish is high; and the population is about an average of what may be considered as neither deficient or burthensome, in a place which depends solely on agriculture. The rental was valued at 1227/., and the population is about 150. The church is a homely structure, consisting of two aisles and a chancel, with a low tower and spire, and the presentation to the rectory is private property. Sir John Cheke, tutor to King Edward VI, was born at the manor house, not far from the church. Upon the southern slope of Mottiston down, at rather more than a fourth of a mile north-east of the church, there is an upright mass of stone, about twelve feet in height from the level of the ground, and near it there is one of smaller dimensions lying on the ground. These stones are of the hard ferruginous sand-stone, common to the back of the Island; but there is no knowing whether nature or art has placed them in their present situation. There is no trace whatever of art, neither is there any pro jecting rock above them from which they could have fallen in the same way that those numerous masses have fallen, which spot the whole length of the Under-cliff. Various conjectures have, of course, been offered, as to whether this upright stone has been erected for Druidical, monumental, or other purposes; but, in the absence of every kind of evi dence, one conjecture is just as good as another, and all are equally unavailable. Brook is another small parish, not extending north of the downs, and less in surface, but perhaps richer in soil than Mottiston. The church, which is a small rural building,"], [229, "185 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. stands on a rising ground, and consists of a nave and chan cel, with a square tower without any spire, at the south-west ; a considerable portion of this little church is clad with ivy, which adds to its rural effect. The manor here was for a long time the property of the Bowerman family ; and we believe the presentation to the rectory is still in the hands of a person of that name. The valued rental of Brook was 872/., and the population is about 130. This completes the whole list of parishes lying to the southward of the downs in West Medina ; for the next parish extends across the Island, from one side to the other. Joining Brook, and extending by Freshwater to the Needles, and so round the Yarmouth river, and south-eastward to the eastern part of Afton down, is the parish of Freshwater. This parish oc cupies a considerable extent of surface ; but much of it con sists of very high doAvns, and not a little of that which is less elevated is sandy and unproductive. This is especially the case with the heights ranging from Alum bay in the direction of Yarmouth ; a considerable portion of which, being unfit for culture, is used as a rabbit-warren. The valued rental is 4552/., and the population about 1200. The best lands in the parish are along the banks of the Yarmouth or Freshwater river, upon the side of which the church and parish village are situated, nearly midway between the northern and southern shores of the Island. Between this point and the inn at Freshwater gate, a fertile valley stretches westward in the direction of Alum bay, but termi nates in the downs before that bay is arrived at. In this valley there is a good deal of population collected into very pleasant villages. At the village of Freshwater there is a bridge across the river, with Afton house on the right after crossing. This small village has acquired some celebrity from being the birth-place of tbe ingenious and deservedly recollected Dr. Robert Hook, whose father was curate of the parish. Hook was born in 1635, and being early de prived of his father, was taken into the home of the Rev. Dr. Busby, where he received his education preparatory for BB"], [230, "186 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF college. At Christchurch, Oxford, he devoted himself with much assiduity to science, attracted the attention of Dr. Willis ; and, by the doctor, young Hook was recommended to the Rev. Robert Boyle. Boyle immediately engaged him as an assistant in his mechanical and philosophical opera tions, in which situation Hook is understood to have rendered him essential service. He was a member ofthe Royal Society at its first institution, and made curator of its models and other collections, and its professor of mechanics ; and he was also chosen professor of geometry in Gresham college. After the fire in London, he was appointed one of the surveyors, in which employment he accumulated money, but never gave up his mechanical pursuits ; and twenty-five years after this he received a degree of M.D. by warrant of the celebrated Archbishop Tillotson, after which he lived 11 years. Besides his mechanieal improvements and inventions, which were many, including, among others, the spiral pendulum watch spring, Hook was the first to draw the attention of the philosophical to microscopic subjects, in the study of which discovery has since reaped so rich a harvest. When Hook was sometimes rallied by his friends upon the smallness of the subject that engaged his attention, he used good natured ly to reply, that he \" thought a great deal more of nature's watches than of her clocks ;\" and perhaps we may add, that his \" Micrographia, or philosophical description of minute bodies,\" may be accounted the real origin of microscopic science. The church of Freshwater has a nave, with aisles and a chancel, and a small chapel at the east end of each aisle. In the chapel to the north there is a richly ornamented arch, supposed to have contained, on a slab, which still remains, a brass of one of the manor lords of Afton ; and there is a tra dition, that a skeleton was found in the grave below, with the head deposited between the knees. The other chapel con tains monuments of the Urrey family. As both nave and aisles of Freshwater church are under one roof, and the side walls low, its appearance is peculiarly squat ; and the"], [231, ""], [232, "y.VA/-: O/1 WIGHT. Winchester Fu.bTish.ed for the E^opirUter Ja \u25a0' finbbtn*. Cctleon Street O f. 'Sa/yttane Dtl ."], [233, "187 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. tower is peculiar, in consisting, in the under part, of two massive piers with a pointed arch over, below which is one of the church windows. Afton house, Freshwater house, and Norton lodge opposite Yarmouth, are the only places of note in this parish. At the time of the Conquest, the prin cipal manors in the parish were, Compton on the south side of the downs, Afton and Wilmingham on the right bank of the river, and Freshwater on the left. With the exception of Wilmingham these were in the possession of Earl Tosti, and retained by William as royal manors. From their valuation they appear to have been of some consequence, even in those early days. Yarmouth is the next parish in order ; it is exceedingly small, consisting of the end of a small peninsula between the Thorley stream on the south, and the Solent on the north, and not much more than half-a-mile long and a quarter broad. It is chiefly occupied by fishermen, pilots, and others connected with the waters ; and therefore the rental is small, in proportion to the population, as compared with any other in the Island. The rental was valued at 806/., and the population is about 600. Yarmouth is one of those towns which were disfranchised when the bill alter ing the representation was passed. The first charter was granted to this borough by Baldwin, earl of Devon, but it sent no members to parliament until the 27th of Elizabeth. As Yarmouth was liable to be plundered and burnt by the French in the early times, it was one of the places where Henry VII caused his castles to be erected. This castle is at the east side of the landing-place, and consists of a platform, with a few guns. The church consists of a nave and chancel, with a small chapel, which is the burial-place of the Holmes' family, and contains a statue of Admiral Sir Robert Holmes, who, when governor of the Island, is said to have built a house for the express purpose of feasting Charles II at Yarmouth. The right of election in this borough was curious, or rather it was arranged in a curious manner by the two parties to which Yarmouth was a pocket bb2"], [234, "188 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF borough. They divided the number of voters into equal sections, each section having the privilege of filling up va cancies as they might occur, so that neither party might get a majority over the other. Holmes and Jervoise were the proprietors of this constituency. Thorley lies to the north-east of Freshwater, and is bounded on the north and east by Shalfleet, excepting for a short distance opposite Yarmouth. Thorley is not a very extensive parish ; but it lies on the low grounds, and con tains rich meadows and highly cultivated fields. The rental, in consequence of the richness of the land, and the sole occu pation being agricultural, is high in proportion to the num ber of people : the rental being 1907/., and the population about 150. The church of Thorley is an exceedingly homely-looking structure ; it consists of a nave and chancel, but has no tower, and a heavy pavilion roof, which gives it the appearance of a barn. The village of Thorley-street, about a mile eastward of the church, on the road to Newport by Calbourne, contains several cottages. Shalfleet is the next parish, rather a large one, of irregular shape, and extending wholly across the Island. It is bounded on the east by Mottiston and Calbourne, from the last of which it is divided, by Shalfleet creek, from Cranbourn mill, where the road to Thorley passes. Brook forms the southern boundary, except where this parish reaches the sea; and just behind Brook there lies a patch of St. Nicholas. The other land-boundaries are Thorley and Yarmouth ; and the line of coast extends the whole way, from Newtown bay to within about half-a-mile of Yarmouth castle. There is another portion of Shalfleet, which lies detached, to the east ward of the parish of Newtown. The church is a very ancient structure, and built in better style than several of those in the Island; it consists of a nave, south aisle, and chancel, which are lofty, and finished with pointed arches and windows. The windows have once been filled with stained glass, upon the remains of which vestiges of the arms of Montacute, earl of Salisbury, and of Isabella de"], [235, "189 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Fortibus, may still be traced. The valued rental is 4736/., and the population 1050. Shalfleet and Ningewood-green, the last upon the most westerly arm of Newtown bay, are the principal villages. We should have added, that the church tower, which stands detached, is massive, but very low ; that it has an irregular dome rising over the battle ments ; and also that, low as it is, it was shattered bylightning in the latter part of the last century. At the Conquest, Gozaline Fitz-Azor obtained this manor; and it soon after- Avards came into a family of the name of Trenchard ; and when Stephen deprived Baldwin, earl of Devon, of his governorship of the Island, Pagan Trenchard was directed to levy the king's dues. These Trenchards were men of some note ; but like many other old families, they died out, after several successions through the female line, which of course changed the name. Calbourne is the only other parish in the West Medina which we have not noticed. It extends about five miles from the downs to the sea, with an uniform breadth of about two miles. This, though still a large parish, and comparatively populous, is probably much smaller than it was at the time of the Conquest. At that time, it is entered in the register as the property of Bishop Walkelin, and mentioned as having been \"always abbey land,\" which na turally means, that the Saxons gifted it to the church at an early period, as of course there could be no abbey lands without abbeys. It is as a manor, however, that it is spok en of, and not as a parish ; and as such, it must have then contained the manors of Swainston and Brixton. It is mentioned as being, at that time, 32 hides or 3840 acres ; but it was rated at only 17 hides, in consequence perhaps of the extent of downs in the middle, that is, there were still 2040 acres which paid Dane-gelt to the king. Six hides of it were held allodially of the bishop, \u2014 the bishop's portion being valued at 30/., that held by the bishop's vassals at 71., and the church, with half-a-hide of land, at 30s. ; the woods had also been pretty extensive at that time, for pannage for"], [236, "190 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF 20 hogs is mentioned, which is a high number, according to the estimate of the record. The manor and advowson of the church retained the original name, and remained in the hands of the bishops of Winchester until the 12th of Edward I, when that monarch, offended at the pope for having made John de Pontessera bishop of Winchester, contrary to the royal wish, compelled that bishop to give him up this manor before he would confirm him in the other temporalities of his see, and also to pay a fine of 2000/. to the king. Thus it became a royal manor. Edward II, when he ascended the throne, gave the manor, \u2014 which appears to have obtained the name of Swainston as soon as Edward I got possession of it, and left the advowson in possession of the bishop, \u2014 to his sister Mary, a nun of Amesbury, in exchange for the borough of Wilton, and some other lands which her father had settled upon her. Upon its reverting to the king, he gave it to his son, who again gave it to William, after wards earl of Salisbury. The Salisbury family were attainted, but again received the manor, which passed, by marriage and descent, to the famous earl of Warwick, who fell in the battle of Barnet, fighting against Edward, Thus, through a series of descents, grants, and attainders, the manor at last descended to the Barrington family, one of whose principal seats was the manor-house of Swainston ; and while Newtown continued to be a borough, they were joint proprietors of the seats. Newtown appears to have been at one time a place of con siderable importance, though it has now dwindled to a few straggling and insignificant cottages. In the days of its decline, however, it, or rather the dictum of the Worsley family, had the honour of returning the late George Canning, to the House of Commons. This borough, originally termed Franchville, or free town, had burghal rights first conferred on it by the bishop of Winchester ; which grant was con firmed by Edwards III and IV, and ratified by Elizabeth, in whose reign it first sent members to Parliament. The accounts state, that this town was burned by the Danes, in"], [237, "191 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. the first year of the 11th century, and styled Newtown after the re-building. Various indications show that it has been of considerable size, \u2014 probably as large as Newport at the present day. It is a good situation for a town, the bay or creek being secure as a harbour, easily made in all ordinary winds, and capable of admitting ships of 500 tons burden up to where the town stood, at least at high-water of ordi nary tides. Among the principal grants, were the privileges of holding a weekly market on Wednesday, and an annual fair on the feast of St. Mary Magdalen, and one day before and another after : most of these ancient glories have how ever passed away ; and though it still has its corporation, its burgesses, and its burghal rights, its greatness, and its popu lation are nearly at an end ; \u2014 and with it we close our brief notice of the parishes in West Medina. EAST MEDINA. In our enumeration of the parishes in this liberty of the Island, we shall again be at the entrance to the Medina, and take the parishes from north to south ; but here it will be convenient to divide them into two sections, because, by that means, we shall obtain a more definite basis for reference. If then, we take a point on the north shore, at the eastern boundary of the parish of Binstead, or nearly a mile west ward of Ryde, we find the western boundary of the parish of Newchurch, extending, in a tolerably straight line, all the way across the Island to Ventnor bay on the Under-cliff; and this line gives us a distinct parochial separation of East Medina into a western and eastern section, \u2014 the parishes in both of which we shall notice, beginning at the north, and proceeding southward. First, we have the parish of Whippingham, occupying the right bank of the Medina to Shide bridge, about a mile south of Newport ; and having its other land-boundary pursuing a zig-zag direction toward Wootton creek, but having the small parish of Wootton, and a portion of Arreton parish, between it and that creek. This is a large parish ; and it is rich and populous \u2014 the valued rental"], [238, "192 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF being 8063/., and the population 2229. The slope of it toward the Medina, and also toward the sea, is beautiful, \u2014 the latter being in many places richly clothed with wood, more especially along the creek denominated King's quay, and the small stream farther to the north-west, which flows past the park and village of Osborne. The church is on the brow of the western slope, at no very great distance from the Medina, and between two and three miles below Newport. This church is a very homely structure, the nave and chancel being in different styles of architecture ; and the tower with a cheveron roof, like that of an ordinary house, and two pro jecting finials at the ends of the ridge, which have exactly the appearance of chimneys. This is one of the churches which was gifted by Fitz-Osborne to the abbey of Lira ; and, since the abolition of the alien priories, the patronage has been invested in the crown. The situation is exceeding ly pleasant, and the adjoining heights command delightful views, both into the valley of the Medina, and across tbe sea to the south coast of Hampshire. At Burton, near to Whippingham, there was an oratory, founded in the year 1282 by John de Mould, rector of Shalfleet, and Thomas de Winton, rector of Godshill. This oratory was for six chaplains and one clerk, to officiate according to the rules of St. Augustine \u2014 the chaplains to choose one of their number as an arch-priest, to preside over the whole fraternity. In the 18th of Henry VI, this oratory was surrendered to Bishop Waynflete, who procured a grant of it to the wardens and fellows of Winchester college, in whose hands it still remains in absolute property. Ihe delightful sea-views in this parish, have caused many pleasant structures to be erected on different parts of it ; and one of the most interest ing of these is East Cowes castle, of which a characteristic engraving is given in this work. Osborne was also a place of some note in this neighbourhood; but whether it was named after the powerful William Fitz-Osborne there are no means of ascertaining. East Cowes, situated in this parish, at the entrance to the Medina, is a low-lying village,"], [239, "193 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. chiefly occupied in shipping and ship-building ; but it con tains a considerable number of inhabitants, and is altogether a bustling place. Wootton, lying on the eastern angle of Whippingham, is an exceedingly small parish, having a valued rental of 695/., and a population of 55. It is a rich little spot however, as is shown by the ratio its rent bears to the population. It lies along the Wootton creek, as far up as the causeway called Wootton bridge, along which the road from Newport to Ryde passes, and it stretches about half-a-mile westward along that road, and along the sea-coast, from Wootton creek nearly to King's quay. There is another small patch, detached from the rest, about a furlong to the Avestward, and also along the side of the road. The passage between Cowes and Ryde lies in-shore here at high-water, between the coast of the land, and the Mother-bank ; and, from the abundance of timber, and the beautiful glades that open in its intervals, the coast of Wootton, like the remainder of this land, is very beautiful. The church is situated about the middle of the parish, but near the boundary of Whipping ham. It is a plain structure, with a very handsome old Norman arch over the doorway, but it has no tower; the belfry being a square lanthorn, placed across the roof near the west end. The living is a rectory, and the advowson is private property. Near the church-yard there is an old and venerable oak, 47 feet in circumference, which is supposed to be the largest in the Island. On Fern hill there is a Gothic mansion, with a very high tower, the top of which commands extensive and beautiful prospects, and which gives the mansion not a little of the appearance of a church, when seen from a distance. The object of the causeway, Avhich has been erected at considerable expence, is to form a mill-pond, which however is much silted up and unsight ly when the water is out. The creek at Wootton is some times termed Fish-pond creek, and may have once been a resort of such fishes as ascend creeks and rivulets ; but if it ce"], [240, "194 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF was once celebrated for abundance in this way, it has fallen off in late years. Binstead lies to the eastward of Wootton, extending to within about a mile of Ryde. The surface of this parish is also very beautiful, the soil being in general a sandy loam. The church of Binstead is pleasantly situated, and has an ancient and rural appearance, the walls being built in the herring-bone style ; but there is no tower, and only a small wooden lanthorn for a belfry. A clumsy figure, carved over a shut-up door on the north side of the church, and sup ported on a bracket bearing a rude resemblance to the head of a horse, has been, by some antiquaries, supposed to repre sent the Saxon Thor; and the inference from this conjecture would be, that the church of Binstead was once a temple of the heathen Saxons. But the church is decidedly Norman ; and no mention is made of it as existing at the period when Doomsday Book was drawn up. The free-stone quarries in this parish were formerly worked to a considerable extent ; and it was from them that Walkelin procured stone for the building of Winchester cathedral ; the tower and transepts of which still remain ; and, though disfigured by the taste less and parsimonious repairs of modern times, they have stood the weather better than even the most recent parts of the building. The abbey of Quarr, which is situated in this parish, is understood to have been the oldest and most extensive mo nastic establishment in the Island. It was founded by Baldwin, earl of Devon, in the 32nd of Henry I, and continued till the dissolution. At that time, the materials were sold, along with the ground, to a merchant of Southampton, and afterwards to an ancestor of the Flemings of Stoneham, in whose possession it still remains. The park belonging to it occupied thirty acres of ground, and those who bestowed largesses upon churches and abbeys appear to have been liberal to it ; there being upwards of thirty grants recorded. It acquired some celebrity as a place of sepulture, but the"], [241, "THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 195 monuments appear to have been swept away along with the other materials. Some documents respecting it are a little curious. There is one granting a pension to Cardinal Beaufort, for haA'ing transferred the church of Arreton to the abbey ; and there is another, consisting of a present, direct ing the sheriff of Southampton to take the convent and its inhabitants under his protection, against the countess, Isa bella de Fortibus. The glory of the abbey is for ever gone ; and the only vestiges of it are a portion of an apartment, supposed to be the refectory, and a kind of old fort, near the fish-house, which the monks appear to have obtained royal authority to erect, for the purpose of protecting their fast day stores against the inroads of pilferers. Binstead con tains at present 258 inhabitants ; and the valued rental was 1044/. Mr. Fleming's cottage is delightfully situated ; and indeed few places in the Island afford more favourable sites for building marine villas than Binstead. It is high and commanding, without being exposed ; its access to the water is direct, and it is within an easy distance of the town of Ryde, where supplies of all necessaries of life may be readily procured. Arreton is the next parish which we have to consider; and though it has no sea-coast, and may be regarded as solely and exclusively an agricultural parish, yet it is among the richest of that description in the Island. It is very ex tensive for an island parish, \u2014 the length from Wootton to Godshill being about 7 miles, and the average breadth, between 2 and 3 miles. The middle of its length consists of high downs, \u2014 Arreton down toward the east, and St. George's toward the west, to the north of which there is another extensive elevation, along which Long-lane passes, and the north part of which forms Stapler's heath. The soil, north of the downs, is in many places sandy or gravelly ; but it is well adapted for the growth of timber, and contains many woods and copses. The parts south of the downs vary from sandy loam to strong clay, and are in general very rich and fertile. In fact, this is one of the best agricultural cc 2"], [242, "196 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF districts in the Island, as it lies in a marine situation, and is protected from the sea-wind in all directions. The situation of the church and the parish village is very pleasant, imme diately under the southern slope of the downs. The manor was once royal property, but it is now passed into private hands. The patronage of the church is in the hands of the Fleming family, to whom it passed with the purchase of the abbey of Quarr. The population was returned 1864; and the valued rental was estimated 9091/. Godshill is the next parish to the southward, and it is of a regular breadth of three miles from east to west, but its northern and southern boundaries are exceedingly irregular ; on the eastern part it crosses the downs, aud extends to the shore at Steephill, along the Western Lines to the westward of Ventnor ; and it is on this portion of it that the beautiful marine villa of Lord Yarborough is situated. In other parts, as for example along the road from Newport to Niton, the boundary of the parish is two miles and a half from the sea ; and both Whitwell and Niton lie intermediate. On the north the boundary is almost equally irregular ; for, while the north-west of it extends to Rokely, about two miles north of the parish church, a point of Arreton parish ap proaches the village within less than a furlong. Great part of the parish of Godshill consists of rich land, and the northern slopes of the downs are much diversified, and almost picturesque ; the elevated downs are of course lighter land ; but they might be, and in many places are, cultivated to the very summits. The eastern boundary of the parish is formed by the brook, which, rising under the north of Rew down, passes Appuldurcombe-street, a little to the southward of Appuldurcombe park, and flows straight northward, supplying French mill, about a mile and a half directly east of Godshill, and joining another branch of the Yar in the north-east corner of the parish. Along the whole of this line of boundary the soil is very rich ; and toward the southern part, where the surface rises into hills and downs on each side, it is exceedingly beautiful. Indeed, this valley, or ra-"], [243, "197 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. ther amphitheatre or basin, in the western part of which Appuldurcombe park is situated, is by much the finest in the Island. On the north-west of the park, and round the west and south-west, the downs rise to a considerable height, having projecting spurs, interspersed by deep glades, and bearing some resemblance to the bastions and curtains of a fortification. The fortified appearance is still further strengthened by the bold lines of rugged sandstone cliff, which divide the banks and terraces of rich green, and pre sent altogether an effect which is exceedingly pleasing. The whole of the fields, which slope from these escarpments towards the Yar and its branches, on the west, the north, and the east, are rich, and in a highly cultivated state. The crops upon the farms seldom fail ; and in average years they are abundant in quantity, and excellent in quality. The farmers here too, or the landlords, or both jointly, appear to have more liberality and good sense than are displayed in but too many other places of the south of England ; and the good effects of this appear to tell among the labourers. One thing is worthy to remark, that, at the larger farms in this part of the Island, the absurd, laborious, expensive, and wasteful practice of thrashing with the flail, to which the labourers in the agricultural districts of the south cling with such foolish pertinacity, and for the continuance of which they have wasted so much valuable property, as well as wasted their time and worn out their strength in the prac tice, has been abandoned, and the thrashing-mill has been established, leaving the farm servants time to perform those operations upon the land which are more worthy of men, as well as to acquire a more thorough knowledge of their field labour, which is the more essential and valuable part of their occupation. These matters may be traced in the fields, the implements, the farm-yards, and the costume and general appearance of the peasantry themselves ; so that those who stand in need of a little schooling on this most essential point of national economy, had better enjoy one Isle of Wight day in roaming over the parish of Godshill. There are"], [244, "198 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF several pleasant little villages in the parish, but Godshill itself is the chief, and taken altogether it is unquestionably the finest inland village in the Island ; and as it is not much more than four miles from the sea, either at Shanklin or the Under-cliff, from each of which it is equally distant, it would be a charming place for a summer residence ; only a great influx of strangers might spoil the rural quietude of its cha racter, which is at present complete and delightful. This may be considered as the home village and church of the most influential family in the Island ; and it has been so ever since the reign of Henry VIII, when the Worsleys came out of Lancashire. This was one of the churches given to the abbey of St. Mary de Lira, to which abbey the manor belonged until it was transferred to the convent of Sheen. On the dissolution, Henry granted a lease of it to Captain WTorsley, by whom it passed to Sir Francis Walsingham, who married the captain's widow, and Sir Francis obtained the fee-simple of the manor. After this it passed through several hands, and was again purchased by the Worsleys, from whom it descended, in the female line, to Lord Yar borough. The church is a fine old structure, in one of the most commanding situations in which a church can be placed. It stands on the top of a pretty high and very ab rupt circular mound of indurated sand, of which all the sides are steep in their escarpments, and the approach to the church is partly by a long flight of rustic steps on the south side. The church is of considerable dimensions, built in the sonn of a cross, with a square tower of considerable height, finished at the top with a bold cornice and richly em battled parapet. Within there are, we believe, so many tombs and sepulchres of the Worsleys, that the last of them that expired had to be buried outside the walls. Some of these monuments are handsome ; and there are older monu mental stones, which have once been inlaid with brasses ; but these have been removed, and the owners are not now known. The tower of this church and its vane have very much the appearance of a conductor or thunder-rod, for the"], [245, "THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 199 preservation of the surrounding village, but the. destruction of the fabric itself; and in January 1778 the tower was shattered by lightning. The Rev. Daniel Walsh, then vicar of Godshill, communicated, at the time, a very circumstantial account to Sir Richard Worsley, from which we make the following extract. \" We had here, on Monday last, about nine in the morning, very severe lightning, with two of the loudest claps of thunder I ever heard. There was a sensible interval between the first flash of lightning and its thunder. The second flash of lightning, and clap of thunder, seemed to be at the same instant. My house rocked as if it were tumbling down, and at first I thought of the effects of an earthquake. I concluded that the cloud would burst, and be attended with fatal consequences. It first made its appear ance against the old tower; and from thence its zig-zag, con fused, and various directions, were so perplexed that they cannot be followed by any continued description. It seems to have commenced its rage near the middle of the wall, about four feet below the dial-plate of the clock, where it tore off large pieces of massive stone, and loosened many others, but did not penetrate quite through there ; some of it must have entered by the spindle in the centre of the dial plate, as it brake the clock-case, liquified the upper part of the pendulum, disturbed the works of the clock, and broke the piece of iron that regulates the striking.\" The village surrounds the bottom of the hill, and consists of cottages which are very much in character with the scene, all of them being rustic, and the fronts of many covered with evergreens and flowers. At the eastern entrance of the village Lord Yarborough has erected a most commodious country inn, where the best accommodation may be had, and from which there is the finest view of the church and village. The grounds in the neigbourhood are very rich ; but the soil, containing a partial admixture of sand, is not apt to be injured, even by the heavy rains to which this part of the Island is at times subject. Its rich quality, and easily pene trable nature, render it remarkably well-suited to the groAvth"], [246, "200 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF of trees, some of which around the village are of large size, and all are luxuriant. Fruit trees, more especially apples, thrive well, and bear abundantly. Indeed, notwithstanding the fanciful etymologies of antiquaries, who have derived the name of Appuldurcombe from Welsh, and one knows not how many other languages, it is doubtful whether the said name means any more than the \" hill or slope of apple trees ;\" an appellation which is strictly applicable and cha racteristic. Appuldurcombe house is unquestionably the finest man sion in the Island, and it stands in the finest park, the lawn being ample, richly covered with grass, and the woods, which are behind the house on the heights to the westward, leave the slope and front of the house clear, with the exception of a few straggling trees near the house, which are not crowded and are therefore ornamental, rather than otherwise. The park is stocked with deer, and the copses and young planta tions in the vicinity abound Avith game. The mansion house is built of stone, with four fronts ornamented with pilasters of the Corinthian order. It was begun by Sir Robert Worsley in 1710, but remained unfinished until it came into the possession of Sir Richard, the last proprietor of that name, by whom it was completed and decorated in a most expensive and tasteful manner. During the years 1785\u20141787 Sir Richard travelled through Spain, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, and Egypt ; and during his travels, in which he was accompanied by several artists, he made the collection which is now contained in this mansion. These consist of various statues and fragments, in marble, in ferra cotta, and in bronze, which are chiefly distributed in the entrance hall, an apartment 54 feet long and 24 wide, having the roof supported by eight Scagliola columns in imitation of porphyry. There are also numerous pictures in the mansion, and many drawings, chiefly of antiquities, representing subjects of classical interest in different parts of the east. Among the paintings, perhaps the finest are, Cleopatra apply ing the asp, by Murillo ; and Joseph with the infant Christ,"], [247, "201 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. by Titian. A description of the marbles, in English and Italian, was drawn up by the collector, and printed in two splendid volumes folio, but never published, though copies of it were distributed, \u2014 one in particular was given to, and is still in the possession of, the London Society of Antiquaries. An order to see this collection may in general be obtained, upon application at Lord Yarborough's agent, in Newport ; but, as visitors to the Isle of Wight are understood to come more to admire the pictures of nature, than those executed by human artists, we shall not enter into any further details. The marine cottage on the Under-cliff, near Steep, which is a very fine picture in its way, was built, or at all events decorated, by the same liberal and tasteful baronet, who made the Isle of Wight quite a study, as well as residence ; and endeavoured to celebrate it with his pen, at the same time that he ornamented it with his plantings, his buildings, his statues, and his pictures. This cottage is situated just under Steep hill, near the north side of the road, and taste- fully enclosed and sheltered by a park, in which there are some luxuriant trees ; and taken altogether it is perhaps the finest and most appropriate dwelling on the Under-cliff, hand- some and well-suited to the situation as many of the rest are. Such are some of the details of the very interesting parish of Godshill ; and we have room only to add, that the rental of it was valued at 8336/., and the population was returned at 1305 by the last census. The living is a vicarage, with the curacies of Whitwell and Niton attached. The present mansion of Appuldurcombe was erected near the site of the old priory house, the materials of which were, we believe, used in the new erection ; and Sir Richard Worsley, who demolished the old house, and founded the new one, has a monument of Cornish granite, raised to the height of about 70 feet, on the adjoining hill. , St. Lawrence is the next parish that claims our attention. It is a small parish, extending rather more than a mile along the shore, and rather less than a mile from the shore inland to the summit of Week down. It is bounded on the east DI)"], [248, "202 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF and north, and half the west side, by Godshill; on the remainder west by the parish of Whitwell; and on the south by the sea. It contains about a square mile of sur face ; about three-fifths of which lies under the cliffs, and the remaining two-fifths above. The living is a rectory, in the gift of Lord Yarborough ; the valued rental is 368/., and the population in 1831 was returned at 78 ; but it is proba bly increased a little since that time. The church is a sin gular object, on account both of its neatness and its diminu tive size. The church-yard, which is close by the side of the public road, is not much larger than the floor of a first rate drawing-room; but it is carefully walled in, kept in remarkably neat order, and the graves are tastefully and ap propriately decorated with flowers. The church, which stands in the middle of this ground, is not above 20 feet long, and 12 feet broad outside the walls, and the height to the eaves is not above 5 feet from the turf outside. By two or three steps downAvard to the little porch, a person can, however, enter it without stooping ; inside there are at most three or four pews or benches ; but it appears that upon some occa sions accommodation is afforded outside, for there are the means of erecting an awning to the eastward of the porch. A large stone font, opposite the entrance, takes up a consi derable portion ofthe area; and by the side of this font the sexton stands to toll the bell, which bell, like the font, is large out of all proportion compared with the church. The sexton complains of the idle visitors from London and other places, who get access to the church when the gate is opened during divine service, and peeping in at the windows, look down upon the congregation and disturb their devotions. This little church is quite a model of neatness, \u2014 that is, it would be one, if the patron or some one else would decorate and re-pew the interior. Outside it is kept in very nice order ; and all the parts are in harmony with each other. On the top of the eastern wall there is a Maltese cross very neatly carved ; and on the west there is the belfry, which appears to be in the form of an arch, with its opening east and west ;"], [249, "203 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. but it is hidden in a cluster of ivy, which also clothes the greater part of the west end of the church, and being kept very neatly trimmed, adds much to the beauty of this pretty little structure. The Under-cliff part of the parish is very rich and diversified. St. Lawrence cottage is pleasantly situ ated between the high road and the sea ; and St. Lawrence well, which pours its living water limpid and sparkling from the rock, and afterwards flowing in a gurgling rill to the shore, is not the least ornamental subject in this delightful little parish. Whitwell, the next parish, is larger in size and very irre- gular in shape ; its greatest length from the sea, along which it has about the same extent of shore as St. Lawrence, is about two miles and a half. St. Lawrence forms its boun- dary eastward under the cliffs, and then Godshill encloses it along a very irregular boundary, by the east and north, and part of the west, to the northern terraces of St Cathe- rine's down ; and here it is met by the parish of Niton, which for about a mile eastward, and then about a mile and three-quarters southward, completes its boundary to the sea. The surface of Whitwell is diversified, but nowhere very ele- vated, the highest part of the parish being perhaps the brow of the cliffs from which the Under-cliff has broken away. Two of the public roads cross the parish from north to south \u2014 the one leading to the Under-cliff at St. Lawrence, and the other to the same at Sandrock hotel below Niton. The church and village are situated on the former road ; the vil- lage being long and straggling, but characteristically rural, and containing a considerable number of inhabitants. Both the rental and population of the parish are considerable for its size, the former being 2572/., and the latter 576 indi- viduals. The church stands on the right-hand side of the road, in proceeding toward the Under-cliff at St. Lawrence ; it is a small structure, consisting of aisles and a chancel, with an embattled tower ; and around, there are some aged trees that add to its otherwise venerable appearance. Though this church is a chapel of Godshill parish, the inhabitants have dd2"], [250, "204 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF their own parochial rules and management ; and to maintain these they have sometimes to contend with the vicar of Godshill and the rector of Gatcombe. The deed recording this shows that the chancel of the present church was a cha pel of St. Rudigund, whose oaken effigies the country people suppose to be deposited at Gatcombe, and as such it was supported by the rector of Gatcombe ; while the body of the church was a chapel of our Lady of Whitwell, supported by the inhabitants of the parish, though under the patronage of the vicar of Godshill. In the same repository there is a lease, granted by the parishioners to John a, Brode, of a house styled the church house, by which it is, \" provided always that if the quarter shall need it any time to make a quarter-ale or church-ale, for the maintenance of the chapel, that it should be lawful for them to have the use of the said house, with all the rooms both above and beneath, during their ale.\" This last document is dated in the year 1574. From another act, it appears that this parish had a considerable population in early times, for in 1632 their num bers were 309. There are some other curious pieces of in formation contained in the munimentary chest of this remote parish, but we have no room to quote them. In the part of it under the cliff, there are the villa of Mirables, and that of Old park, together with the now ivy-clad ruins of a chapel, built in 1370 by Sir Ralph de Wolverton, and known as Wolverton Under-cliff; but this portion of the Under-cliff is so thickly strewed with vast masses of rock, and some of these are so clad with ivy, and have their craggy sides so like the fragments of an old and time-worn building, that it is not easy for a novice to distinguish the one from the other. Above the cliffs there are several substantial farm-houses in this parish, but there is no mansion of any consequence. Niton, the only remaining parish in this division, has Whitwell on the east, Chale on the west, and the sea on the south. Its length from north to south is about a mile and a half, and its breadth from east to west about a mile and a quarter. This parish, though much smaller in extent than"], [251, "205 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Whitwell, contains more inhabitants, but the valued rental is considerably lower. The population was returned at 573, and the rental was 1991/. The parish church of Niton is another of the six conferred on the abbey of Lira ; but it is now in the gift of Queen's college, Oxford, and has been so since the time of Charles I, who bestowed various livings on that body, not, as has been alleged, in return for the col lege plate given him at the time, for it was not till fifteen or sixteen years after that Charles applied to the prevost and fellows for the plate, promising in his own handwriting to see it repaid, at five shillings an ounce for white, and six pence more for gilt. His majesty received three dozen tankards, and other things, amounting to 591/. Is. 6d. ; but the promise of payment lies still in the college bursary un redeemed. The vicarage of Godshill and the chapelry of Whitwell are usually united with the rectory of Niton ; and, we believe, the rector generally resides at Godshill, while one curate does duty alternately in the forenoon and after noon at Niton and Whitwell. Niton church is rather hand some, and bears marks of considerable antiquity. It consists of a body and south aisle, with a chancel ; and the east window of the chancel appears at one time to have been filled with stained glass, from a head of the Saviour which still occupies a small space in the upper part. The embat tled tower is massive, and supported on the sides toward the eastern part by two great buttresses, and over the em battled parapet there is a little spire which is not very orna mental. The Under-cliff about the middle of Niton parish is rather wider than at some other places, and contains some good farms ; but the extreme west of it is disfigured by the land-slip of 1799, which has not yet recovered its verdure. At the gorge, where the road descends from the village to the Under-cliff, on the right-hand in going down, West cliff house is situated. This house, the situation of which is very pleasant, acquired some celebrity, from being for many years the residence of a retired barrister, and a great miser, who is said to have died worth about two millions"], [252, "206 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF sterling, great part of which was secreted about the house for some time previous to his death, he having taken it into his own possession from being doubtful of the stability of the bank. There are several other pleasant cottages here ; and Sandrock hotel is a very neat place of entertainment, in an elevated and delightful situation. The immediate vicinity of this is indeed the richest part of the Under-cliff; and, with all the advantages of the wild cliff and the rugged middle ground, it has beautiful and productive fields toward those masses of rock which form a bulwark against the sea. As the ledge which projects outward from Rocken-end causes a sort of eddy here, food is brought in abundance for some of the inhabitants of the water, especially for crabs, which are so plentifully obtained, and used to occupy so much of the time and attention of the humble inhabitants, that crab used to be prefixed as an epithet to the name of the parish ; and it is probably in part owing to a number of the people being thus occupied, that the population is higher, compared with the rental, than that ofthe parish of Whitwell. The church of Niton is a little to the westward of the road, and just about one mile from the sea. The village is rather large, having the principal buildings along the Newport road, and others along the cross roads. It contains a good inn, and various shops for the supply of ordinary necessaries ; so that those who wish to enjoy the Under-cliff quietly and economically, cannot do better than set up their staff in the White Lion at Niton, where the famed mineral well, Black-Gang chine, the cliffs by the shore, and some of the finest views in the Island, both sea-ward and land-ward, are all within the compass of an easy morning's walk ; while the road from Newport is direct, and there is a regular convey ance backwards and forwards during the season, without the encumbrance of an Isle of Wight fly, with its sociable seats and Mackintosh curtains. Niton completes the parishes in this section or zone of East Medina, and from the examination of it we must again return to the north coast opposite Portsmouth."], [253, "207 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Newchurch is the next parish, and it extends, with a pretty uniform breadth of about one mile and a half, quite from north to south across the Island, which is an average length of about ten miles. Its abutment on the sea is almost exactly the same at the north and at the south, being about a mile and a quarter at each ; and it is not unworthy of remark, that the two watering places which have been of late years extending the most in the number and shoAviness of their buildings, and consequently in the number of their visitors, for whose accommodation those buildings are chiefly erected, should be at the opposite extremities of this parish \u2014 Ryde on the north coast of the Island, and Ventnor on the south coast. The parish church is near the middle of the length of the parish, but farther from the southern extremity. The vil lage and church lie upon a cross road, which passes the river Yar about the middle of the village. The parish, which contains between twelve and fifteen square miles of surface, a considerable portion of which is land of good quality, has necessarily a high rental and a numerous population, inde pendently altogether of the watering places which fringe its two extremities. In 1815 the rental was 11,856/., and the population in 1831 was 4928 ; and perhaps we shall be within the mark if we estimate the present rental at 13,000/., and the present population at 6000. This, which does not differ much from the ratio as given by the tables, though it is an increase in both items, shows a much lower rental, in proportion to the population, than we meet with in those parishes ofthe Island which are chiefly agricultural. The rental of Newport, which is a town with comparatively little land belonging to it, had by the return a rental of 21. 4s. Od. to each inhabitant ; while the estimate for this parish, which has an extent of at least 8000 acres of land, much of it arable, and the remainder pasture of various kinds, shows only a rental of 21. 8s. Od. to each individual inhabitant. Compare this with a parish which is exclusively agricultural, as for example with the adjoining parish of Arreton, and it"], [254, "208 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF will be found that the returns give a rental to each inhabi tant of 4/. 16s. Od., or exactly double the former ; we must not however make this the sole criterion of advantage derived even by the landlord, \u2014 but it does form one element, and shews pretty clearly that the permanent advantages of the Island are to be sought for in the improvement of its agri culture, rather than from the number of strangers that resort to it, how advantageous soever they may be at certain sea sons of the year, and to certain spots. We must also bear in mind that a very considerable fraction of the population has been added since the valuation of the rent. By the return of 1821 there were 3945 inhabitants ; and comparing this with the number in 1831 we find an increase of 25 per cent, during the ten years ; and the increase per cent,, even without reference to those who merely come and go, has been proportionably greater during the time which has elapsed since the census of 1831 was taken. Ryde or Ride, as the most flourishing place in the parish, and we may perhaps add in the whole Island, claims our first attention. It is not a parish, and does not appear to have possessed any chapel or place of worship until the early part of the eighteenth century, at which time, an ancestor of the present lord of the manor, an occupant of Ryde house, G. Player, Esq., erected a chapel, and charged the manor with ten pounds yearly rent, to be paid to the vicar of Newchurch, or to some one officiating for him in the said chapel. Pre vious to this time it does not appear that Ryde was anything better than a mere coast village, inhabited by a few fisher men, and employed as one of the stations where watch was kept for the safety of the Island ; but from this time, chiefly perhaps owing to the frequent wars, and consequent bustle in the naval establishment at Portsmouth, it has risen in population and in value. It is now a town, second only to Newport, containing probably not much less than 4000 inhabitants, and possessing at least the most showy streets and buildings in the Island. The hotels, of which there are three principal ones, are in the first scale in respect of"], [255, "KVlEiE AWE) PO E IB , IM.I.

Nature has forbidden that this place shall ever be a shipping port of any conse- quence ; but the commodious pier, which has been extended on a substantial wooden frame-Avork for more than 1700 feet, affords accommodation at its extremity, for steam-boats and other craft drawing little water, at every state of the tide In summer, the passage steam-boats ply five or six times a day to and from Portsmouth ; and there are regular coaches during the season to the back of the Island through Brading on the eastern line, and Newport on the western. The rapid increase of the town, rendered it necessary to re-build and en- large the church, which is now a handsome gothic building, with a tower and spire. There are also dissenting chapels, national schools, a theatre, and a handsome toAvn-hall and market-house. The market is well supplied ; and besides the home supply there is a regular exportation of various articles of country produce to Portsmouth. The situation of Ryde is remarkably pleasant ; the neighbouring grounds are richly adorned with trees; and there are various elegant villas in the suburbs. The time has not arrived at which it is possible to write a proper description of this rapidly- thriving village ; but if it continues to advance for twenty years longer at the same rate and in the same style, as during the last ten years, it will then have few rivals on the coast of the Channel. We have said, that it neither has nor can have a harbour of its own available for the purposes of ordi nary commerce ; but both Spithead and St. Helen's roads are within a short distance, and vessels there can hold ready communication with Ryde in all ordinary states of the weather. Ventnor, on the opposite extremity of the parish, is in some respects, and indeed in most; the very contrast or anti thesis to Ryde. Ryde is situated on the shore of a compa ratively tranquil part of the sea, where there is a level beach EE"], [258, "210 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF dry to a considerable extent at low-water : the clustering groves come down to the water's edge ; and the houses more resemble a slice of second-rate fashionable London, stuck on the side of the Island, than anything which one would be prepared to meet with, \u2014 at least any one who resorts to the Island in consequence of the tale of its wild beauties; which by many describers, indeed by most of them, is told in what Shakspeare characteristically terms \" a tyrant's vein \u2014 an Ericol's vein \u2014 a part to tear a cut in,\" and wherein the said describers do their best to make their own words exceed ingly ludicrous and bizzare, if they cannot catch the expres sion and portray the lineaments of this most lovely gem ofthe sea. At Ryde all is simple beauty \u2014 beauty of a high order we grant, but still nothing but beauty. At Ventnor there is something more, and something less. It would be doing it injustice to call it simply beautiful ; and it would be doing injustice to the term to call it picturesque, far less sublime, in the highest sense of the word. It is certainly not in the richest or most characteristic part of the Under-cliff; but still there is an indescribable wildness about it, which belongs to no other place, and which is a perfect contrast to the soft, and as we Avould almost say the voluptuous, beauty of Ryde. It is a village in its infancy ; but it is growing apace, and one cannot easily predict what it shall one day become. It already contains a neat church, some comfortable inns, and numerous lodging-houses, together with the requisite number of permanent habitations, and all the facilities for those who Avish to renovate their lungs in the air, and purify their bodies in the sea. The ground upon which it stands is highly diversified, being up one knoll and down another the whole way ; and the line of the shore is more zig-zag and embayed than in most other places of the Under-cliff. The elevation behind it is of the same character ; for, in some places it consists of craggy cliff, from which portions have evidently been rent away by some former earthquake ; and to the eastward of these it consists of wild hills, which come swelling down in their rotundity toward the lower, but"], [259, "..... i I , 1:11 HI 11 ll.ll/ lh... /..,\u201e, /\u25a0\u201e/./,.:.,./ ,. ..\u25a0/:, /,/.,,., ,:.//,.\u201e .un, I I;, III: ,:,/,\u201e liiitie library //,,,/, Uriel"], [260, ""], [261, "211 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. most unlevel ground, without any very perceptible marks of disruption ever having taken place, \u2014 though this character changes a very little to the eastward of the village. We have said that at Ryde there is a quiet and beautiful line of coast, with groves extending down to the water's edge, and a sea which is never agitated into great fury, even in the most adverse and turbulent wind. At Ventnor, on the other hand, there is much irregularity, and much nakedness of surface ; while in stormy weather the sea displays itself in all its grandeur, and thunders upon the projecting mounds of rock in most magnificent style, the yeasting foam of the surges rolling violently into the coves, and rendering it necessary to haul the few light craft, which belong to fisher men and others, upon the dry land, so as to protect them from the violence of that element for which they are intend ed. With all these peculiarities of character, Ventnor is a spirit-stirring village ; and they who delight in the wildness of Nature, whether on the varied surface of the land, or in the wildness of the sea, Avill perhaps prefer it to any other. ' As we said of Ryde, the time has not yet come when the history of Ventnor, or even of its description, can be written with effect ; for it is still more in its infancy than the former place ; but we may be permitted to say that even at present it promises well and pleasantly. After noticing these two villages at the extremities, any description of the intermediate parts of the parish will be but tame. The southern part of it consists of the high downs of St. Boniface and Shanklin, enclosing, in a curve concave to the westward, the upward farm of Wrexall ; and being, with the exception of St. Catherine's, the highest in the Island. From these downs northward, the ground descends, rapidly at first, from where the artificial ruin of Cook's castle is situated ; and then more gradually all the way to the parish church on the banks of the Yar ; but still the centre of the parish is a summit-level even here, from which the direction of the rivulets is both eastward and westward. About a mile north of the church, and some- EE 2"], [262, "212 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF thing less of the Yar, the downs of Messly, Knighton, and Ashly, intersect the parish, the last trending northward, and having a sea-mark on its summit ; and immediately under these downs on the south, is the manor-house of Knighton, with its park, the only one of consequence in the part of the parish south of these downs. Northward of the downs towards Ryde, the centre of the parish is still a summit-level; but the surface is nowhere elevated, and it is pleasantly broken by clumps of copse and timber. The church \u2022 and parish village are rural and pleasantly situated, and that is all. We now turn to another and the most easterly section of the Island, which consists of the parishes of St. Helen's, Brading, Yaverland, Shanklin, and Bonchurch ; and lies along the eastern boundary of Newchurch, being every where else bordered with the sea. St. Helen's is the first parish in the north, beginning a little eastward of Ryde, and extending round by St. Helen's road to the entrance of Brading harbour, along about half of the north side of which, a point of land belonging to it ex tends. In breadth of surface it is but a small parish, being only about three miles from east to west, and nowhere ex tending above a mile in-land from the sea. It is, however, pleasantly and advantageously situated in the close vici nity of St. Helen's road, and facing the entrance of Ports mouth harbour, between which lies the principal anchorage of Spithead. There are accordingly several pleasant resi dences in the parish, and the rental and population are con siderable as compared with the extent ; the rental being re turned at 2399/., and the population 953. In former times, divine service in the parish was performed by the prior of the religious house there, of which house very little now remains ; but the little church in which this service was performed, together with the church-yard, having been in vaded by the sea, it became necessary to have a church farther in-land ; accordingly, the bishop of Winchester per formed the necessary ceremonies upon the ground, and a new"], [263, ""], [264, "yjtiurya.JOf.Jr [SBAISOMC (gH-JURSM.

Some parts of this little parish abound in wood ; and it is altogether a pleasant part of the Island, though its character is only that of simple beauty. Brading, the next parish to the south, is an extensive one, stretching southward, from the borders of St. Helen's to the northern slope of Shanklin down, about six miles and a half, with an average breadth of about orfe mile, including besides, the peninsula of Bembridge, on the south of the harbour. The rental and population of the parish are both considerable, the former being rated at 10,908/., and the latter at 2227. The town is considerable, as well as the parish, though St. Helen's, Yaverland, Shanklin, and Bon church, have been from time to time formed out of it ; and it thus once occupied the whole of the eastern section of the Island. Brading is a market town, having a corn market every Monday, and two annual fairs, on the 12th of May, and the 2nd of October. The market-house, where a consi derable quantity of corn is disposed of, by sample, is held under the town-hall, a small building near the church, the upper part of which is now we believe used as a school ; but that there may be no doubt as to the fact of Brading being a town, the motto on the common seal is, \" the Kyng's towne of Brading.\" The town is rather pleasantly situated, and still contains a considerable number of inhabitants, whose dwellings are along the sides of the main road, upon the left-hand side of which, in proceeding from Ryde, stands the parish church. This parish church is a large structure, indicating perhaps, that the toAvn has been larger than it is now ; and several parts of it are in different styles of archi tecture. It consists of a nave and chancel, with the tower and spire at the western extremity ; and the nave and chancel are separated from each other by a rude Gothic arch. In the chancel there is a stone slab, on which is represented the figure of a man in armour, with his feet on dogs, having the Virgin Mary with the infant Christ, and the Apostles, some-"], [266, "214 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF what rudely carved, with an expression on the border, indi cating, that he who is buried below was, when he lived, John Cheralbin, constable of Porchester castle, that he died in the year 1440, and his soul rests in peace. There are also aisles ; and in one of these there is a monument, with an inscription, which appears to mean, \" for Jesus' sake, have merci on Wyliam Bowly's sowl, Amen ;\" and on the other side, and of course included in the benediction, there are the words \" Helizabeth, Hys wyf.\" The south chapel contains several monuments of the Oglander family, who still remain, and whose seat of Nunwell, though a plain build ing, is in the midst of a fine wood, and one of the chief orna ments of the parish. This parish contains the wild promon tories of Culver cliff, with the Bembridge ledge, and the Foreland ; and it is, upon the whole, well worthy of a visit, or rather of a deliberate and careful examination. Yaverland is a small parish occupying a patch of land, with the sea off Redcliff on the south, a mere point abutting on Brading harbour in the north, and everywhere else sur rounded by the parish of Brading. It is an agricultural parish, fertile and valuable in proportion to the number of its inhabitants ; the number of these in 1831 being only 96, while the valued rental was 1062/., or more than 10/. to each individual. This parish was one of the early seats of the Russell family, some of whom fell in defence of the Island. It is understood that this church was erected and endowed by the Russell family very soon after the Conquest. The church consists of a nave and chancel, with a door-way elaborately ornamented in the Norman style. Shanklin. is a very small parish, lying between the down of the same name, and the sea. It has a rental of 758/., and a population of 225, which probably has a little increased, in consequence of the resort of visitors to the village as a place of summer residence. The church is a very rustic structure, but in a pleasant situation, and appears to have been a favourite with Prior Silkstede of Winchester, who, among other things, bestowed upon it a curious old chest, with his"], [267, "s a *** \"jy fe a S. & | S, s is- ,_, \u25a0> ix L *\u25a0 Si S* S3 PP S^ -\u00a7 '1 = fe h 2 -I\" I"], [268, ""], [269, ""], [270, "B 0 fl C !K1 QJ K C KI . _TiiE Oi* T_I(-HT YAW ECLAIR) \u00a9, ISLE \"I W10SI Winehcitr, Hi/,1,,/,,,1 i\u201er //,, Boprirtm I\u201e'J^I/\u201ei\u201e attest Street"], [271, "215 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. initials, the sword and double keys, and various other legends and devices. The parish of Shanklin, which is partly on the downs, and partly near the sea-cliffs, which are high, terminates southwards at Luccomb chine, or nearly so, where it borders with the small parish of Bonchurch. Bonchurch is a parish entirely under the downs, or as one Avould say, in the eastern part of the Under-cliff; the rental is small, as also is the number of inhabitants, \u2014 the former being 464/., and the latter 176 individuals. It is, however, pleasantly situated amid the wreck of Nature, under the cliffs ; and there are some pleasant residences in the vicinity. In this part of the Under-cliff, of which the termination is the parish of Bonchurch, the high road gains no great elevation for commanding a view of the scenes of devastation which this part of the Island presents ; but there are few spots within it which are better worthy a visit ; and in the north-eastern part of this parish, there is to be seen one of the most recent land-slips which has occur red in the whole of the back, or southern side, of the Island. We have now taken a hasty, but we trust an accurate, topographical glance at this far-famed Island ; and if we have been less fervent \u2014 we had almost said furious, in our eulogy, we are not the less sincere in our admiration, and we trust not the less faithful in our descriptions. There is far too much of the substantial bounty of Heaven in the soil and the climate, and far too much of rational discernment in the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight, for admitting either of them to be the theme of fiction and romance ; and, as for the particular scenes which have been so often and so extrava gantly bepraised, they may be all very marvellous to those who have never seen more than a dull field or a dingy mo rass ; but, for one who has been familiar to the true sublime and romantic in scenery, they will not do. The supposed sublimities of the Island are all ruins ; and although the ruins of an abbey make a very pretty sight, one cannot say as much for the ruins of the earth itself. The sublime and the picturesque there, are formations, and not destructions."], [272, "216 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF The comforts of the Island, in the estimation of reason, far exceed its peculiar natural wonders \u2014 as they are termed. The tasteful villa, the neat farm-house, the rich field and meadoAV, the cleanly cottage ; and above all, the air of health and comfort which is breathed by every class of the people, these are the true beauties of the Isle of Wight. Having thus ventured to state our opinion in a fair and candid manner, we cannot close accounts with this justly favourite spot of ground in a more appropriate manner than by taking a farewell glance, in a hasty circumnavigation, \u2014 which we shall do in the next chapter."], [273, "217 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. CHAPTER VIII. SEAS AND SEA-COASTS. From the extent of its lines of coast, the general and national value of its seas, and the contrast which different parts, both of the coast and the sea, form of each other, a notice of the Isle of Wight, however cursory, would be imperfect without a short chapter under the above title. If we take the four sides of the Island, as determined by the extreme points to which we have already alluded, we find that each of them has a different character, both as regards the sea itself, and as regards the line of the land which abuts upon the sea. Not only this, but in addition, each pair of the sides, the two southerly, and the two northerly, have a character in common Avith each other, as contrasted with the common character of the other, independently of the peculiar character which belongs to each of the four indi vidually. The south-west and south-east sides are both Channel coasts; and, from the general course of the winds and set of the tides, they are both dangerous ones ; but their dangers are of different kinds, although the difference de pends in part upon the direction of the wind at the time. If the wind is strong from the north, the danger of both coasts is lessened, and a vessel may stand nearer to the land with safety than when it blows from any other point. On FF"], [274, "218 SEAS AND SEA-COASTS OF the other hand, if the wind is dead at south, both are dangerous to a vessel, whether her course be up or down the Channel ; but, in the average of winds, the south-west coast is the more dangerous to upward-bound vessels, and the south-east to downward. Still, however, the south-east is the less dangerous of the two, unless where a vessel gets embayed in an unfavourable wind, and is unable to weather the Under-cliff from the west, or the Foreland on the east ; as in this case, there is not a single point of safety along the whole line, and scarcely any alternative but running on shore. Westward again, there is no point of safety between the Needles and the southern extremity of the Island; neither is there any beach there upon which a vessel can be run in-shore in a heavy sea, without certain destruction to the vessel, and the utmost peril to the crew. With the ex ception of a small portion of sand and clay, there is scarcely any part of the two divisions of the south coast that has not numerous rocks near the land, which it is next to impossible to avoid in the event of the vessel drifting. From all these circumstances this part of the Island has a large extent of coast useless to navigation, and forming one continued peril throughout its whole length. The narrow seas on the north side of the Island are very different from this ; because, if a ship can reach the eastern entrance, at St. Helen's or Spithead, there is good and safe anchorage ; and if it can pass the Needles, there is after wards a safe passage, to Cowes' roads or to Spithead, as may be desirable. In this last-mentioned passage, there is indeed no anchorage, except perhaps behind the point at Hurst castle ; and as little is there any harbour or creek in which a vessel of considerable burden can find shelter. This western or Solent branch of the narrow seas, has not merely the tide-wave passing along as an undulation, but an actual current, or transfer of the water, which runs with con siderable velocity in the direction of each set of the tide. It should seem, however, that this current by no means increases the danger, because the Channel is straight, and"], [275, "219 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. deepest in the middle ; and thus its tendency is to float a vessel right through, and not send it on shore as would be done by a tide-wave setting to the shore broadside on. Hence, though not a place of permanent shelter, generally speaking, the Solent is a safe passage, so that if it can be taken at its western extremity by an upwTard-bound vessel, the danger to that vessel may be said to be over. The western entrance to the Solent at Hurst castle is not quite a mile across, but the channel is deeper here than it is farther to the eastward, there being ample room for a ship, in not less than ten or twelve fathoms; and at the very narrowest place it is considerably more than this. No part of the mid-channel has less than about eight fathoms, while it becomes twelve again toward the entrance to the Southampton Water; and at all times there is at least a mile in breadth, with not less than five fathoms, even within a short distance of the mud-banks. At the place opposite Leap, where some have supposed that the Island was joined to the main-land, the channel is not narrower than in most other places, and it is rather deeper, which may be regarded as conclusive against the hypothesis. On the whole of the New Forest side there is not a rock or a hazard; and, if the beacon of \"Jack in the basket,\" at the entrance of the Lymington river, is steered clear of, there is no possible danger on this hand. On the Island side there are a few rocks ; but they lie near the shore, scarcely farther to seaward than the narrow bank which has accu mulated in all the inbends, from Carysconce, about a mile west of Yarmouth, nearly to the entrance of the Medina at Cowes. In the other branch of the narrow sea, if the mid dle channel is kept, between the Bramble on the west and Middle-bank on the east, there is sufficient water all the way to Spithead and Portsmouth; and in Cowes' roads there are seven, eight, or ten fathoms, and more in some places. The Mother-bank, in the bight eastAvard of Cowes, has not more than two fathoms and a half in any part of it, and only one and a half in some places, but still it is easily ff2"], [276, "220 SEAS AND SEA-COASTS OF avoided; and it may with truth be said that, when Cowes on the one hand, or Spithead, or even St. Helen's, on the other, is arrived at, this part of the narrow sea is harbour all over. It is true, that the sand-bank at Ryde is dry to a great extent at low-water; but then Ryde is not a harbour for any craft of burden, except the passage-boats between Portsmouth and the Island; and a pier has been carried out for their accommodation. From Hurst castle all the way eastward, the sea is making no inroad upon the Isle of Wight shores, which are margined by banks the whole way ; and it does not appear that those banks are accumulating, at least to any perceptible extent. This, therefore, is altogether a very quiet shore, against which no strong tide or current sets ; neither is there any kind of powerful action from seaward upon the land ; and this is one of the reasons why the whole extent of it is so pleasant, both as landscape and for residence. No gale in vades and stunts the trees ; and thus they come down to the water's edge, \u2014 at least at high-water, \u2014 in the same luxuri ance of growth as if they were on the banks of a fresh-water lake. Thus, the immediate margin of the sea, in this part of the Island, has all the freshness of a place of marine resi dence without any of the violence ; and this is the reason why it is so thickly spotted with villas, and so much orna mented with woods and shrubberies, more especially about Cowes and Ryde, \u2014 which, being the principal places for arrival and departure by the regular conveyances, have natu rally been preferred to the other parts of the coast, though, for the purposes of mere residence, the whole line of it is equally eligible and beautiful. This character extends to Brading bay, and at least as far south of it as the Foreland; so that, with the exception of the short distance from the Needles to opposite Hurst castle, the entire extent of it is a very inviting country, either for visitors or for permanent residence. In respect of advantage to be gained from the sea itself, this beautiful line of coast has but little to boast of. Fish"], [277, "221 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. are few, and not of the most valuable quality, or such as can be taken in great numbers with comparatively little labour. The creeks and runs in the banks afford abundance of the smaller Crustacea, and various flat-fish are caught ; whitings are not unfrequent ; and, in the season, mackerel and some members of the herring family are found ; but the fishing for none of them is very certain or productive ; and thus the business of a fisherman, upon these shores, may be described as poor and unprofitable. Some species of gurnard are occasionally met with ; and more frequently the grey mullet, which is a very vigorous and ranging fish, and often attains a tolerably large size, but if entrapped in a tender net it is apt to break through. We believe that the species or variety most frequently obtained upon this part of the south coast, is the thick-lipped grey mullet sMugil chelo). This is a much thicker fish in proportion to its length than what is usually termed the common grey mullet sMugil capitoj ; and though the distinction has not always been attended to, it really seems to be the most common fish in these waters. It is at once known from the other by its thicker body, its thickened lips, its large and thin deciduous scales, and the less definite marking of the longitudinal rows of spots upon the sides. Mr. Couch, of Polperro, the great ichthyologist of the Chan nel coast, mentions that it is \" gregarious, frequenting har bours and the mouths of rivers in the winter months in large numbers, all of which are just of one size.\" We have, however, known of their being taken in the narrow seas between the main-land and the Island, in the end of summer and the beginning of autumn ; and of those taken at the same time, some have weighed eight or ten pounds, and others not much more than as many ounces. Still, however, this is not a fish whose ground is known, and which can on that account be regularly taken by fishermen who devote their attention to that purpose. It is a very ranging fish \u2014 in one place to-day, and another to-morrow; and thus, though it is one of the most valuable fishes in these narrow seas, the capture of it is very much a lottery."], [278, "222 SEAS AND SEA-COASTS OF On the back of the Island fishing is no better, if indeed it is as good ; and there it is more perilous, because the sea runs with much more violence, and disturbs and drives away the fishes, as well as endangers the fishermen. Still, wherever there is a sea-shore and creeks, attempts of some description at fishing will be made ; and this is the case here, though to capture a fish, properly so called, is both unprofitable and unsafe. There is, however, one description of fishing, if fishing it can be called, which is carried on to a considerable extent upon all the rocky shores at the back of the Island ; and more especially on that of the Under-cliff, where the rocks are more numerous and irregular than any where else. This is the capture of the larger Crustacea \u2014 crabs and lobsters ; the first of which especially are found in great numbers upon these shores, and many of them are sent to the London mar ket. They are taken in trap-baskets, or \" crab-pots,\" which the animals enter readily, but from which they cannot escape on account of the peculiar form of the entrance. These pots are baited with any sort of garbage, and the more rancid that the bait is the capture is the more certain. So abun dant are these Crustacea on some parts of the rocky shore of the Under-cliff, and so much are the inhabitants engaged in the capture of them during the season, that the village of Niton there is vernacularly known by the name of \" Crab Niton.\" This kind of fishing, or more correctly speaking \" crab bing\" \u2014 as Crustacea are not \"fishes,\" is very closely connected with the perilous kind of fowling which is practised on the lofty cliffs, more especially those between Freshwater and the Needles, in the height of the summer season, that is, chiefly during the month of June. Countless multitudes of those aquatic birds, which build, or rather deposit their eggs without building, in the crevices or on the ledges of the rocks, resort to these cliffs in the pairing time. Unless at this particular time, most of the species which breed in the Island, \u2014 chiefly cormorants, shags, razor-bills, guillemots,"], [279, "223 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. and a few others, \u2014 live dispersedly over the waters, and find their food each by itself, without any more recognition of its own species than of others ; but, in the breeding time, they come to these particular cliffy in crowds, and fill all the ledges and holes of the rocks, inhabiting story above story to a height far exceeding the most famed \" castle of flats \" in the ancient part of the Scottish metropolis. It is the habit of some of them to seek for the holes of the cliffs, where they are not seen unless when on the wing ; but others deposit their eggs simply on the rock itself, and are not very solicitous about the extent of ledge upon which they place them. None of the tribe have, we believe, more than one young one at a time ; though, if the first egg is removed, the female will deposit another and continue her incubation. It may seem singular that birds which appear in such mul titudes at single points, and thus seem to be much more nu merous than birds which have large broods, \u2014 than partridges for instance, \u2014 should be able to keep up their numbers by one at a hatch, and one hatch in a season, the more especi ally that their sea-faring life appears to be a laborious one. But we can see, not only that there is a sort of deception in these numbers, but that there is a beauty of adaptation, a fulfilment of the purpose of nature, in this same limited brood. We see the numbers, and we imagine that they may be equally plentiful at other places along the coast; but in this we are deceived. Appropriate breeding-grounds for these birds are by no means numerous ; and, therefore, to such a locality as the cliffs alluded to, they come from long distances, deserting, during the breeding months, a very large extent of coast. This is a provision of nature not un worthy of notice, \u2014 the sea immediately under the tall cliffs, where such birds breed, is never fitted to the depositing and maturing the spawn of fishes; and the drawing away of those birds which are most voracious and successful catchers of small fish, during the time that the fry of the summer fishes is in myriads along the breeding-grounds, tends not a little to preserve some of the most valuable species of fish ;"], [280, "224 SEAS AND SEA-COASTS OF and even to furnish the birds themselves more abundantly, when they return, than they would be furnished were they to destroy the small fry. So much for the collecting toge ther of those birds which live almost exclusively by fishing. Then again, as to the single egg, or at least the single young, which each pair have to attend to during the season. Most birds resort to breed in those places where food for themselves and their broods is most plentiful, and most easy to be found ; and we have seen, that the places to which these birds resort are the very reverse of this, while both the old birds and the young are very voracious feeders. Besides this, the young must be matured in their growth and strength before they can in any way provide for them selves, as there is no intermediate state between the bird being wholly fed by the parents, and its performing the same severe labour in the finding of its food as they do. The young of land birds, especially of ground birds, such as the Gallinid\u0153, can make some shift for themselves the instant that they come out of the shell, which they do, with their wings mere flaps, and not a perfect feather upon their whole bodies. Flat-billed, or quaffering aquatic birds, too, such as ducks, can in part find their own food without any use of the wing ; and hence such birds have large broods, which move about and take to the water as soon as they are out of the shell. But, with the rock-building sea birds, whether those of long wing, which beat over the surface of the broad waters, or those which pursue their prey in the water itself, the case is widely different. They need all their energies before they can find a single morsel for them selves ; and thus their parents must send them abroad into the world perfect birds. There is of course, in the young of these birds, a capacity of being matured during the time that they remain in the breeding places; and the fact of their having comparatively little action during this period may promote their development. But still, in order that any animal may rapidly come to maturity, that animal must be correspondingly fed ; and therefore these rock birds could"], [281, "225 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. not possibly collect food for a large number; and indeed, considering the places to which they resort, and the purpose of nature, which they answer by so resorting, it appears wonderful that they can feed to the full extent that is requisite, more especially as such vast numbers resort to places where food is far from abundant. Most of these birds have the instinct of being peculiarly attached to their young ; and the strength of this instinct is required, other wise the birds would not undergo so hard labour as they must undergo in the discharge of their paternal duty. This labour, generally speaking, gives sufficient exercise to all their powers of motion, without any of that sporting on the wing which is observable of less laborious habits. When undisturbed, they go quietly upon their foraging expedi tions, and return as quietly, to feed the nest-lair, or the young one, as it may happen. During the incubation, the male and the female sit upon the egg by turns, and the one which is relieved dashes abroad to find food for the sitter ; and when the young one makes its appearance, the pair take the labour of supporting it alternately, in a manner worthy of study, if not of imitation, by the human race. After they return from those labours, they repose upon the ledges, each after its manner, and in its own attitude. The razor-bills, and other birds which pursue their prey through the water, and, to adapt them to this purpose, have the feet placed far backwards, sit nearly upright in lengthened lines, all as grave as judges, in their snowy vests and sable mantles ; while the long- winged cormorants and shags, which only dip the wing in water, and do not drive through it, may be seen closely spreading out their pinions to be dried in the sun. \u2014 Such are the seas and shores of the Isle of Wight, and such some of their native inhabitants. Brief as are the notices contained in these chapters, we trust that in them we have made out a case, showing that this Island contains something more than a series of retreats for the lounger, and of sights for the wanderer. In both of these respects, we are willing to admit that its merits are GG"], [282, "226 THE ISLE OF WIGHT. high; but still it has other merits of a far higher order. Nowhere within the limits of the British empire is there so much of geological information comprised in so small a space; for we have the whole series of formations, from the uppermost fresh- water formations, down to the wealden clay ; and the inroads of the sea have made all the littoral sections so abrupt, and keep them so fresh, that the whole may be read and understood as a book, by simple instruction. Limited as is the extent too, we have each formation in almost all the varieties that it can assume ; and then, in its strata, the Island is a complete study. In respect of the action of the sea, in the gradual decomposition of old lands, and the formation of new, the Island also presents every ordi nary form \u2014 crumbling shore, tumbling cliff, and landslip; and though the materials thus removed are not, to any con siderable extent, cast upon the shores, either ofthe Island or the lands adjacent, yet they go to form banks in various parts of the sea ; and the different composition of these banks \u2014 gravel in one place, sand in another, and marl in a third, all tend to prove that the tertiary strata have been arranged by action similar to what is going on at the present time.

CHAPTER I. POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION. The Channel Islands, though minute and detached por tions of the British dominions \u2014 being much nearer to the French coast than to that of England, are yet spots of considerable interest, as well for the beauty and peculia rity of their scenery, as for the steadiness with Avhich they have cleaved to the English government, and the bravery with which they have, when occasion required, repelled the attacks of invaders ; notwithstanding their small size, and the fact that the vernacular language of the native popula tion is much more allied to the French tongue than to the English. It is true, that these pleasant little Islands are so fenced in by nature with munitions of rocks, that the land ing of a hostile army upon them, is a matter of no common difficulty ; but still, even this would of course be overcome, Avere it not that the brave and high-spirited inhabitants have, all along, claimed England as their country ; and reject- B"], [292, "4 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ed, and successfully resisted, the domination of France. This is the more to be wondered at, when we consider that the French are not only much more the brethren of the Chan nel Islanders than the people of England, but that it is Avith France that their readiest, and therefore perhaps their most advantageous, intercourse is carried on. The inflexible loyalty of the people of these small Islands to England, in spite of geographical position, of language, of community of origin, and of trading intercourse, would be an especial marvel in the history of mankind, were it not that there are certain peculiar circumstances, honour able certainly to the manly feeling and independent spirit of the people, which go far to explain it. In tbe more early times, and before there was any unity of government between England and any part of France, these Islands folloAved the natural course of their geographical position ; and they formed part of the dukedom of Normandy, and were probably Normans in the principal part of their num bers \u2014 for the Normans were a maritime people \u2014 when the dukedom of Normandy was lost to the English monarchs, and became part of the kingdom of France. The continental Normans, weary, perhaps, of being under a foreign yoke, offended, and justly offended, at the conduct of all the Eng lish monarchs, from Rufus to King John inclusively \u2014 under the last of whom the sovereignty was lost, passed over to the French dominion, not without some fighting by the partizans of the English king certainly, but without any thing that could be considered as a national resistance ; for, though the changes of fortune to which they had been sub jected had, in all probability, lowered the high tone which the Normans possessed in these early times, when the king of France gave the country to Rollo the first duke, as a bribe to restrain him from farther exerting their valour against the Franks, yet the dukedom was even then so ex tensive and rich, and the inhabitants of it so numerous and warlike, that, had they been heartily disposed to resist, they would have been no easy conquest. The inhabitants of the"], [293, "5 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. Channel Islands had not been affected by those commotions which disturbed the main-land of Normandy during the period alluded to ; and therefore, on the one hand, they had no enmity or hostility against the English government, while, on the contrary, they regarded the French as the subduers and enslavers of that dukedom of which they themselves formed a part ; and which became extinct, as an independent state, by the annexation of it to the crown of France. This appears to be the true theory of the constitu- tional adherence of the Channel Islands' people to the British government ; although, strictly speaking, they are, even to this day, vassals of the English monarch, and not part and parcel of the English nation. Their municipal laws are their own, nearly the same as established in the reign of John, who voluntarily gave a \" little charter \" to the people of those Islands, before the united barons and people of England compelled him to sign the great charter, at Runny- mede. These Islands have no connection with any English county ; they have no representative in the British parli- ament ; and neither that assembly, nor any other power in England, excepting the sovereign in council, which is un- derstood to be only another name for the uncounselled pleasure of majesty, has any authority over them. In spiritual matters, indeed, they belong to the diocese of Winchester ; but this can be considered as little else than a mere form, as the livings in the Island are not such as to excite any very strong degree of sacerdotal interest, \u2014 which is an exceedingly quiet and passive power, unless when under the influence of certain stimuli \u2014 the spiritual benefit of the souls of men of course. As the Channel Islands have no British parliamentary legislation, and no voice in the progress of that grand and laborious effort of human wisdom, so they are not called upon to bear any part of the burden of the United King dom ; but are left to carry their own peculiar load upon their personal shoulders. Whether this may be a privation, or a privilege, is a point of no small difficulty, and one Avhich b 2"], [294, "6 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF we are not called upon to determine. That the British Houses of Parliament are most sounding and self-impor tant combinations of men of sterling pretence, we dare not call in question, because the fact is as palpable as the sun at noon-day, or the solemn tones of their eloquence at mid night ; but still it is not a point finally adjudicated, in the court of reason and common sense, whether these most labo rious assemblies are a national good or the opposite ; and the point is so beset with difficulties, that it would be unwise to hazard any positive conclusion respecting it. One thing is certain : the people of the Channel Islands, estranged from England in locality, in language, and in laws, and having no voice whatever in either House of Parliament, quoad the Islands themselves have remained as stanch and loyal to the crown, and as manly in their defence of their own homes and rights, as they could possibly have done, had they been represented by a score of peers, and a hun dred members of the lower house. The working out of this question would however lead us to a field which we have no desire, and certainly no necessity, to enter; and therefore we shall take leave of this part of the subject with the simple passing remark, that the unrepresented people of these Islands are as happy and prosperous in themselves, and as devoted to the integrity of the empire of which they form a*, part, as if their parliamentary represen tatives were as many, in comparison with their numbers, as the members for Old Sarum were before the passing of the law for changing the election of members of parliament. We do not wish to make any comparison, as comparisons are proverbially odious; but we must take permission, if we are not permitted, to say, that the tie which has bound the patch of the Channel Islands to England for so many centuries \u2014 ever since the Norman Conquest indeed, is of a more high and holy nature, and as such, much more safe from the inroads or the invasions of time, than any thing can be, which is based upon legislators and their enactments."], [295, "7 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. The people of the Channel Islands have this proud boast \u2014 and it is one of which a kingdom or empire of the most ample dominions might be proud, that, out of the two formerly powerful states of England and Normandy, they are the only portion whose locality has not been conquered. It is true, that neither the acquisition of the throne of Eng land by William, nor that of the dukedom of Normandy by the king of France, was a conquest in the more extended sense of the term. William was, in some measure, the adopted heir to the throne of England ; and Harold was, in strict honour, both a usurper and a traitor : a usurper, be cause the crown was not his by direct and legitimate descent ; and a traitor, because he had sworn fealty to Wil liam, against whom, therefore, his raising an army, was positive rebellion, in the proper and legitimate sense of the term. Nor is there any doubt that, had it not been for the powerful control which that arch intriguer and tyrant, the notorious Earl Godwin, exercised over the mean and pusilla nimous mind of Edward the Confessor, Harold would never have set up the slightest pretensions to the crown. Those who are carried away by prejudice, and who attribute to the dissipated Saxons virtuous qualities which they never possessed, may lament that the battle of Hastings terminat ed in the manner which it did ; but an impartial observer, and sincere friend of the welfare of mankind, will not fail to see, even in the conduct of the armies of Harold and Wil liam, on the night preceding the battle, that the real benefit of England consisted in victory having decided in favour of the latter. The Saxon rabble, which Harold had collect ed, spent the eve of the battle in riot and debauchery, while the more orderly soldiers of William spent it in prayer and religious exercises. In such exercises there may, in these dark times, have been not a little of mummery and nonsense, inasmuch as the character of religion takes its colouring from that of the worshippers ; but still, be the religion what it may, Heathen or Christian, superstitious or rational, the man who is sincere in the performance of its rites is the"], [296, "8 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF good man ; and probably as good under any one type as under any other ; and, therefore, whatever may have been the mummery or superstition which blended with the religious rites of the army of William, on the night previous to the memorable battle of Hastings, the simple fact of their per- formance of those rites shows that they were men of a higher tone of mind, and more worthy of conquest, than their dissipated and unruly opponents. We say nothing as to difference of skill in the art of war \u2014 the proper term is the art of murder; for we are speaking of moral feeling, and there is no moral feeling in the fact of one man putting another to death, however skilfully and scientifically he may go about it. But, when we find one assemblage of men, orderly in their conduct, and given to the performance of the rites of religion, whatever these may be, while the opposing army give themselves up to all the grossness of sensual dissipation, we can be at no loss in deciding which party deserves the ATictory, in what manner soever the scale may turn up. The latter is a point too high for human philosophy ; for, when we look at the history of the human race, and mark the risings and fallings of states and nations, and all the vicissitudes to which their rise and their fall are apparently owing, we must admit that the alternate balance, even of human power, is in a hand far more mighty than that of man. Thus much for the moral cause and consequence of the subjugation of England to the Norman yoke, under the high spirited, and, as no one will deny, the wise and sagacious William. If the successors of this talented king were not worthy it was not his fault ; and, besides this, there seemed to be a sort of incongruity in the same ruler holding Eng land and the continental dominions of the duke of Normandy in France. The attempt to do this was in fact the division of a house against itself; and we do not need to quote Scripture in order to be convinced that such a house cannot stand. The interest of England, and the interest of Nor mandy on the other side of the Channel, could not, by phy-"], [297, "9 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. sical possibility, become one interest ; because there rolled between them a barrier of many miles of sea. Hence, the government of the two must have been, from the very nature of the case, a sort of see-saw, in which it must have depended greatly upon the temper and feelings of the reigning monarch, whether he should prefer England to Normandy, or the re verse ; and thus, although the loss of this duchy by John plucked a valuable feather from the wing of English power, it tended greatly to the consolidation of the insular power that remained ; and it may, with truth, be said to have con tributed more to the subsequent greatness of England, than Magna Charta, or any other document which Avas ever ob tained from any king, or concocted by the wisdom, or the vanity, of any legislature. When, therefore, we look candidly at the acquisition of the English throne by William the Norman, we cannot regard it in any other light than that of the victory of one rival party over another ; and, consider ing the characters of the parties, as they are handed down to us, even by the enemies of the Norman, the result was a blessing to England rather than the opposite. The reluctance of the Islanders to yield to the sway of France, \u2014 which reluctance they have kept up to the present day, \u2014 no doubt originally arose from the primary hostilities between the Normans and Franks ; and, as the English government interfered very little with the customs and usages of the Islanders, and these people were besides not much subjected to the exactions made on the people of the main-land, for supporting the ambitious wars, which the suc cessive kings of England waged against France, and gene rally carried on upon French ground, to the great mischief of that country, and at much loss to England, the burden of royalty sat much more lightly upon them than upon the bulk of the English nation ; and thus, their loyalty was pro portionably ready and abundant. This is to be considered as the main reason why the Channel Islanders have so long kept up their connection with the British throne, notwith standing their geographical proximity to France, their using"], [298, "10 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF a dialect of the French language, and the majority of their laws and customs being Norman. This point, however, will be better understood when we come to give a brief outline of their history, which is deserving of a separate chapter, inasmuch as it is the history of a distinct country and race of inhabitants, far more than any single county of England ; and as much nearly, in proportion to the extent of surface, as that of the British Islands, considered as a kingdom. The Channel Islands are four in number, besides some smaller ones, and many rocks. Alderney is the nearest to England in position, and also to the coast of France; its distance west of Cape La Hogue not being above eight or nine miles, and it lies directly west of that part of France ; and the rocks in the intermediate passage seem to indicate a former connection between them, though such connection must have been severed long before the commencement of any historical record. Alderney is about fifty-five miles nearly south, but a little eastward, of the bill of Portland, which is the nearest part of England ; and it is about seventy-five miles from the Needles, at the Isle of Wight, and about the same from Start point, in Devon. Guernsey is about fourteen miles south-west of Alderney, and thirty miles from Cape Flamanville, the nearest point of France. Jersey is about twenty miles south-east of Guernsey, and lies within about fifteen miles of the coast of France, at the point Avhere they are nearest to each other. Jersey is also about thirty miles south of Alderney, only it bears a little to the east. Cerq lies nearly midway between them, only a little to the westward of the straight line, and within about eight miles of the east coast of Guernsey ; and the small Isles of Herm and Jethou lie between Guernsey and Cerq. The Islands thus lie something in the form of a crescent, with its convexity to the sea, and its concavity toward the French coast ; and when one bears this in mind, and, at the same time, examines the position of the French coast, and the set of the currents and prevailing winds, one can readily"], [299, "11 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. understand, that, unless at the most tranquil seasons of the year, and during the calmest weather, the surrounding sea, and the straits and passages between the particular Islands, and also between all of them and the French coast, must be turbulent beyond the average of the British seas. In order to understand fully the action of the Avater, and of the atmosphere, as affected by the water, and by the gene ral Atlantic current, \u2014 which sets so habitually from the south-west that there is no strong and long-continued wind from any other quarter, which blows upon these Islands on the part of the Channel in Avhich they are situated, \u2014 in or der rightly to understand this, one must examine the forms of both the English and the French coasts, and note their positions with regard to each other. The westward opening may be taken as from Brest to the Lizard in Cornwall, and here it is just about 100 miles from land to land. From Start point to the French coast, immediately south, the distance is about the same ; but when we come as far up the Channel as the bill of Portland, Ave find the state of things very different. From the bottom ofthe bay, east ward of St. Malo, to the bill of Portland, the distance is more than 130 miles ; and it is a straight line, or nearly so, all the way, \u2014 its inclination being a few points to the west ward of north. Seventy miles of the southern part of it are, however, occupied by the coast of France to Cape La Hogue; and, with the exception of a few trifling embayments, this line of coast is not only directly opposed to the tide and current which set up the Channel, but its inclination west ward, as it stretches north, makes it lay hold of this current, and deflect it toward the south. The current here spoken of must be understood as meaning only the tide wave ; for there is no great current of Avater which sets up the Channel, and through the strait of Dover into the North Sea \u2014 the main supply of that sea being brought round the opposite extremity of Britain. The French coast of Brittany, Avhich extends along the south side of this embayment to its east ern termination, is irregular, with projecting points, that c"], [300, "12 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF lay hold of the tide, and intervening bays which turn it into eddies. The result of this is, that, all along this part of the shore it is greatly retarded, in comparison with its motion in the mid-channel ; and because of this retardment, the tide arrives at Cape La Hogue a long time before it arrives at the bottom of the bay, 70 miles southward. The conse quence is, that there is a point of convergence of these two portions of the tide, about the spot where the Islands are situated ; and, as all the varieties of tide are much affected by this state of the Atlantic currents, arising from the wea ther, the tidal action among these Islands, upon all their shores, and upon the adjacent French shores, especially that to the eastward, is both violent, and uncertain as to the pre cise time of its occurrence. The numerous ledges of rocks, with which the neighbourhood of the Islands abounds in most places, tend farther to increase the dangers of the navigation. This is peculiarly the case with Alderney, which cannot be reached with safety, excepting when both wind and tide are favourable. The particular sea-dangers of this Island can, however, be mentioned with more pro priety when we come to treat of it as a principal subject. In their geological structure the Channel Islands have little or no resemblance to the portion of England immedi ately to the northward of them. The prevailing rock is gneiss, or sienite, or some other member of the granite for mation, \u2014 though, in some places, passing through a sort of porphyry into compact feldtspar and greenstone. Thus, it has some slight resemblance to the rock in Dartmoor ; and it will be seen, upon looking at the map, that a line drawn from Dartmoor forest passes through both Jersey and Guernsey. The parallel between these strata and those of Dartmoor is however by no means perfect ; for the Dartmoor granite is not only different in texture from that of the Channel Islands, but veins of it often intercept the slaty rocks which have been upheaved and broken by it ; and it also contains metallic ores, especially those of tin and copper. The Island granite is much darker in colour, smaller in the"], [301, "13 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. grain, and does not form veins in any stratified rock, though it does pass into stratified gneiss, of the debris of which, the basis of the soil, especially in Guernsey, appears to be composed. The granite here is also much intersected by veins of quartz, which have probably been infiltrated from above, and by veins of greenstone and other obviously volcanic products, which have been evidently pressed up- Avard from below. All the Islands give evidence of having been subjected to violent action, both during the time when the present strata were formed, and subsequently to their for mation; and this, in all probability, before they were reduced to the small extent which they now possess. This violence of action is proved, not only by the veins which intersect the strata, and by the position of the remaining part of the gneiss, but by the vast numbers of boulders, and other masses of stone of large size, which are buried in the earth, or exposed on the surface, and which occur in all the Islands ; but are particularly abundant in Alderney, which, from its position, is exposed to the most violent action of the water, and has by far the most dangerous ledges of rock in its neighbourhood. What the particular nature of the action may have been, or Avhen it happened, are points which we cannot connect with the history of the inhabited earth. This much however is certain, that the general for mation of rocks in all these Islands belongs to a deeper series, that is, to one of a more underground origin, which has been formed by subterranean agency, without direct con nection with the atmosphere, or the operation of anything like a surface volcano ; though the rents in those rocks which contain the veins, are probably of volcanic origin; and the greenstone, which fills many of them, unquestion ably is. All these formations are much lower, that is, much more immediately from the depths of the earth, than anything which is met with on the opposite part of Eng land ; for, instead of gneiss and granite, we have none of the older stratified formations, or even of the loAver oolitic series, on the proximate parts ofthe English coast, either ofthe main- c 2"], [302, "14 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF land or of the Isle of Wight. In the present state of things, therefore, it is quite impossible to establish any geological connection between England and these Islands ; because we want the connecting links which lie between them and the bill of Portland, or the back of the Isle of Wight ; and. unless we could obtain some clue to the succession of rocks there, which have apparently been at the last carried away by the action of the Channel, we cannot establish any good foundation for a theory of general action, in the situa tions now occupied by the sea, between the Isle of Wight and these Islands. It is here that we have the beginning and end of the series. In the Isle of Wight we have every stratum, from the very uppermost tertiary, or alluvial formation, down to the upper oolites ; and in the Channel Islands again, we have granite, and the allied rocks, than which we know of nothing which is eleva ted from lower depths of the earth. In what the Isle of Wight reveals to us, also, we have not the slightest evidence of anything like volcanic or other action working from a depth up to the surface. The north coast of Jersey, and the south coast of Guernsey, certainly afford evidence of some action in the intermediate space, far more powerful than that of the present sea, high as is the rise of its tides, and violent as are the motions of its currents. The north coast of Jersey is very precipitous, while, toward the south and west, the surface, though high in some places, is in general much lower. It is upon the lower coast of this Island that sea-action is most apparent, both in the rocks which lie off the shore, and in the sandy beaches which have formed in the bays. When we turn to Guern sey, the state of things is reversed ; for there the south side is the more precipitous ; and there has been most formation of banks ; and there are also the greatest number of rocks along the north-west side. There is even reason to believe, that those rocks, Avhich appear above the surface, either per manently, or during certain periods of the greatly-varying tide, as well as the other ridges, which, though never bare,"], [303, "15 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. throw the water over them into great agitation, are all so many remains of land, Avhich has probably, at one time, united all these Islands, and also connected them with the main-land of Europe, and probably also with the south of England, \u2014 there being, as we have said, the indication of a connection betAveen these two Islands and Dartmoor, both in apparent position and geologic structure. The disrup tion, however, which has taken place, even among the Islands themselves, severs them too widely apart for allow ing us to form any certain judgment concerning their former state, farther than that they seem fragments of a land or lands, at one time much more extensive than the Isles are now. This is farther corroborated by the portion and the appearance of the island of Cerq. That is wholly a table-land, comprised of rock from side to side, and every where presenting nearly perpendicular cliffs, from which far more extensive land must some time have been detached. Taking them altogether, the Channel Islands are very singular spots. They of course have that climate which is peculiar to small portions of land exposed to the direct action of the Atlantic tide and its atmospheric current. The weather beats strongly upon them ; and the rock has been disintegrated by its constant action, to a much greater ex tent than is found in rocks not harder, and exposed to similar action, in higher latitudes. This disintegrated rock, chiefly gneiss, at least in some of the Islands, has contributed greatly to the fertility of the soil, and the ease with which that soil can be laboured. In consequence of this, though the produce of the Islands is nowhere so exuberant as upon the marls and clays of regions differently formed, yet the land is sharp and fertile, and all that grows upon it is of excel lent quality ; and though each island is but a miniature coun try, it is a beautiful, and far from an uninteresting, one. One advantage results from the comparative mildness of the win ters, there being in none of the Islands any permanent snow. Except stone, Avhich all the Islands furnish in abundant quan tity, but which, though very durable, is fully better adapted for"], [304, "16 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF paving, and other coarse purposes, than for elaborate ma sonry, it may be said that no valuable mineral is found in any of them. Coal there is none; the rocks belong to too deep a formation for having any of the ordinary chalk strata ; and if the earlier limestones ever existed, they have long since disappeared. It used to be stated, in the old accounts, that one of these Islands supplied emery, which is so much used by lapidaries, for grinding and polishing hard substances of every description. Such, however, is not the case ; and we are not aware that there is any argillaceous stone, at all equal in hardness to emery, met with in the Islands, either in powder or crystals. The emery of com merce comes from some of the Greek islands, and also from Asia Minor ; and the wreck of a vessel from one or another of these places, upon the dangerous shores of the Islands, may have given rise to the false statements so often repeated. The seas around the Channel Islands, unless in places where the water suffers violent agitation, supply a great many fish, though not any of the more valuable shoaling ones in great numbers ; and, though there are a good many fishermen in the Islands, either the dangers of their employ ment in such turbulent seas, or the want of proper encourage ment, renders this but a trifling branch of occupation. The fish usually found, are either the ranging species, or flat fish, and others which inhabit at a considerable depth, and therefore can get below the troubled water in case of storms. There is some difference in the supply as one proceeds to ward the mid-channel, and accordingly, Guernsey is better supplied than Jersey ; but still, both partake of the general character of the Channel, in not having any regular supply of the more valuable white fish. The fishing grounds around are of course not adapted for cod ; and the waters are too turbulent for haddock. Whiting is the most abundant fish ; and it is most plentiful of any of them in the Channel Islands' seas ; but it is not one of the most valu able of its tribe. The surface fishes are not numerous ; for mackerel appear to range nearer the English coast, and"], [305, "17 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS herrings or pilchards are very rarely met with. The action of the tides and currents is indeed too violent upon all the shores for admitting of their being favourable abodes for fishes, at least those fishes which resort to the same grounds in multitudes at particular seasons of the year, \u2014 and they are the only ones of which the capture can be said to form a profitable article of trade. Conger eels are perhaps the most plentiful in the Channel Islands, and they grow to a large size, being six feet long, as thick as a man's arm, and weighing half-a-hundred Aveight. The flesh of these eels is of inferior quality ; and not at all to be compared to that of any of the varieties of silver eel which ascend rivers, especi- ally the clear rivers of the chalk districts, and migrate to the sea during the winter only, and then little farther than the top of the brackish water, where they remain inert, and buried in the mud, during the cold months. Of course there are few fresh-Avater fishes of any consequence in these Islands, where the largest collections of running water are merely brooks; and there are no species that migrate between the fresh-water and the salt, or resort to the shores in numbers, for the purpose of depositing their spawn. To be adapted for this, especially in the case of the more nume- rous and valuable fishes, there must be some permanence in the coasts of the land, and some peace on the waters ; but so far from this being the case in the Channel Islands, the spawn of fishes would be sAvept away before it were well deposited on the shores. These are circumstances which admit of no remedy ; and, therefore, the inhabitants of the Islands, in return for that genial weather and favourable climate, which the action of a continually moving sea brings to them, must be content with their moderate supply of fish. Of this supply, in as far as the Island-markets are concern ed, we shall have to say something afterwards \u2014 and of course it will extend in proportion as the demand increases ; but this matter belongs to the details, and not to the general view of the Islands. The Crustacea, \u2014 lobsters, crabs, praAvns, and others, have"], [306, "18 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF a different mode of re-production from the fishes ; and, there fore, the rocks and beaches of the Islands are well adapted for, and plentifully supplied with, them, \u2014 just as is the case with the southern shores of the Isle of Wight, which, though different in their geological formation, and also in their appearance, yet bear some analogy to the Channel Is lands, in as far as the action of the atmosphere and weather is concerned. Shelled mollusca, and among others the common oyster, the most esteemed of the whole race, are plentiful in some of the bays, because they anchor themselves so that the motions of the Avater do not carry them away ; and, as this anchoring prevents them from ranging in order to come at their food, their favourite localities are those in which a movement of the waters brings that food to them. The nature of this food is not very well known ; but it is gene rally believed to consist of some of those extremely minute animals, Avith which the water is, in some peculiar places, \u2014 generally places where there is a mixture of eddy and current, \u2014 so very abundantly supplied. Hence, oysters, though numerous in their particular localities, where they breed, are local; and any further notice of those of the Channel Islands will come, with more propriety, into the des cription of the particular places where they are most plentiful. Laver, samphire, and the other partially esculent products of rocky shores, whether in the tidal waters or above the high-Avater mark, are met with in the Channel Islands. Samphire, as every one knows, is not a sea-weed, and yet it will not grow except in situations where the spray of the sea reaches it ; and thus it is found chiefly upon the faces of the most lofty and perpendicular cliffs, and the labour of gathering it is proverbially an adventurous and perilous oc cupation. Perhaps the most valuable products of the sea to the inhabitants of these Islands, are the various species of fucus, or common sea-weed, which grow very abundantly and freely upon all the rocky parts of the shores, to beyond the lowest depth to which rocks are exposed at the ebb of"], [307, "19 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. spring tides. These sea-weeds, more especially fucus vesi culosus or bladder wrack, which is the most abundant and rapid growing, are valuable in the manufacture of soap and glass ; and they also furnish, in larger quantity than any known substances, iodine, which is extremely active in its properties, and appears to be intimately connected Avith pro duction of colour in all substances, vegetable or animal, and perhaps even mineral. This sea-weed, or vraic, or vrac, as it is locally termed, serves the Channel Islanders as a substitute, and by no means an inefficient substitute, both for fuel, and for lime as the stimulating principle of manure. There is also every reason to believe that, if they knew how to turn its proper ties to account, it might be applied as a cement more firm in its texture than any that is obtained from lime or other mi neral preparations ; for it is well known, that some of the most firm and permanent glues or fine cements made use of by the ingenious natives of Japan and China, are made from certain kinds of sea-weed ; and the oriental swallows, whose nests are so much prized by the Chinese as a substantive ingredient of tonic and restorative soups, obtain the substance of those nests from another species of fucus. There is indeed no question that many of the sea plants ; which are nearly allied in everything but habitat to the Iceland moss, and other jelly-producing lichens, might, with due knowledge, be turned to valuable account in domestic economy, as well as in the arts. The groAvth of these plants is perennial ; for, in the uniform temperature and perpetual bath of the ocean waters, they know scarcely any difference of summer and Avinter ; and give them but a new surface, to which their innumerable spor\u00e6 can adhere, and they will elaborate, during the severest Winter, a quantity of vegetable matter, unrivalled by the summer produce of any land-plants that are known, and all this without a single deleterious quality in any one of the numerous species ; though many of them are so tough in their consistency, and so strongly im pregnated with combinations of soda, that they are not eat- D"], [308, "20 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF able, until they have undergone some preparatory operations, which shall dissolve the rigidity of their texture, and remove those parts of their composition, which render the taste disagreeable. Few parts of the British shores, or of the little islands with which those shores are in many situations so thickly studded, are more favourable, either for the growth or for the gathering of those sea-weeds, than the shores of the Channel Islands. Sea-weed is, under a perfect equality of other circumstances, far more abundant and rapid in its growth in the warm seas than in the cold ones \u2014 following, in this respect, the general law of vegetation upon the land. The Channel and the western shores of England receive the Atlantic current from latitudes warmer than their own ; and, along with this current, they of course receive countless numbers of the spor\u00e6, or germs, of the sea-weeds ; and hence, though such weeds also flourish abundantly on all places of the eastern shores which are at all adapted to them, they are far more luxuriant in the western. The vast range of tide upon the shores of the Channel Islands, gives them double value and productiveness for sea-weed, as compared with most other shores belonging to Britain. The difference in height, between the top of the flood and the depth of the ebb along the shores, averages from 40 to 50 feet, according to the set of the currents and the positions of the sun and moon ; and, as this may be reckoned fully double of what takes place upon the average of the British shores, the sea weeds have a double advantage ; and their value to the inha bitants, in those uses to which they apply them, is of course increased in the same proportion. The local name vrac or vraic is not confined to these Islands, but is common in many parts of the country, especi ally on the shores of the Scotch Lowlands, where the inha bitants are more or less of Norman, that is Northmen or Norwegian origin; as well as the people of the Channel Islands. In these parts of Scotland, the w is used in some districts, and the v in others, just as is the case in all places"], [309, "21 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. where there is an admixture, and a pretty large admixture of Norman blood in the people, though the same difference also occurs where they are more exclusively Celtic, and may therefore be regarded as, in some degree, a climatal mode of pronunciation \u2014 for climate has more influence upon the or gans of speech than many are apt to suppose. The Scottish word is \" wrack, \" or \" vrack, \" the latter having, however, nearly the sound of the vraic of the Channel Islanders, and being chiefly used by the inhabitants of mild and fertile climates. WhereA'er the term is used, or in which way so ever it is pronounced, it appears to be derived from the root \" vreccan, to cast ashore,\" \u2014 the very same word that is used literally in cases of shipwreck ; and, figuratively, in many other cases. In the case of the fucus it is highly applicable ; for, in the agitated states of the waters, especially those which take place about the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when the maxima of ocean' tide and atmospheric distur bance combine with each other in rendering the state of things peculiarly unsettled, this fucus is wrecked, or cast on the beach, often in very abundant quantities ; and the same happens at other seasons of the year, after the waters have been for some time in a state of disturbance. Apart from the local advantages to such people as those of the Islanders \u2014 who use it as fuel and as manure \u2014 of this stranded sea-weed, there is a principle, connected with the fact of its coming ashore, which it is necessary to understand before one can examine the sea with due knowledge of the economy of that extraordinary element. It is a fact, palpable to any one's observation, that all the coasts of the land, composed of mineral substances, or of dead shells, or other animal pro ductions, or vegetable ones in which life is extinct, are habi tually wetted by the ocean waters, to the full extent that these waters act upon them. It is also a fact,well known to those acquainted with the economy of nature, but not so pal pable to common observation, in those who do not attend to the principles of things, that no living production of the sea, or any other water, is wetted by that water while it remains d 2"], [310, "22 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF in the living state. This is known to be the case in all waters, however soft and limpid they may be, or however mixed with saline and other active substances ; and it is also known, that the more such substances exist in the composi tion of any water, whether of the sea or of any other collec tion, the more completely are the living inhabitants of that water, animal or vegetable, protected against its action upon the surface of their bodies. The substance which nature employs for this purpose is a mucous, or slimy mat ter, of some description or other, in which the surface of the living being is habitually bathed, and by which it is com pletely protected from that macerating and decomposing influence, which the water, whether salt or fresh, would otherwise exert upon it, and in so far operate its destruction ; in the same manner as water very speedily decomposes the greater number of organized substances after they are dead. The most remarkable and important relation, between the waters of the sea and the dead and living inhabitants of that element, is not, however, the circumstance of the living productions and inhabitants elaborating a mucous, or slimy production, by which the wetting is prevented, and which applies, not only to aquatic plants and animals covered with soft skins, but even to the most compact of the porcelain shells, which, when living, are invested with a kind of mem brane, often of extreme tenuity, which possesses the same quality. The curious part of the matter, is the difference of their relation in the sea to a substance which can be wetted by its waters, and to one which cannot be so wetted. The wettable substance finds its way to the wettable shore, by an obscure, but by a very certain and constant kind of attrac tion ; and the substance which the water of the sea cannot wet, has no such tendency to come on shore, but remains to perform its functions in the water. No matter, whether it is marine plant, marine animal of any kind whatsoever, or aquatic bird which frequents the waters, without habitually living in their volume ; for, if the plant or the animal is fitted by nature for living in the sea, there is no surface-ac-"], [311, "23 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. tion of the sea upon it, as long as it is in the living state ; and it consequently has no tendency whatever toward the shore. But when either plant or animal dies, and ceases to perform its functions, including the production of the water repelling mucus among the rest, it is immediately subject ed to the economy of the waters, just as if it were a dead thing ; and then the action of the sea casts it on the shore, as having no longer connexion with the energy and economy of living nature there. This is the cause of the vast accu mulations of shells with Avhich we meet on various shores, and on some of the shores of the Channel Islands among the rest ; and it is also the reason why that sea-weed, which is so valuable to the Channel Islanders, comes ashore in con siderable quantities, after those violent disturbances of the ocean waters, which have torn it from its natural situation as a living vegetable, and transferred it over to those dead products, which the sea invariably casts upon the strand, as being no longer useful in its very varied economy. If the people of the Channel Islands were fully aware of this peculiar property of dead sea-weed, it might save them no small portion of their labour, at those times of the year when the time arrives to cut and carry this weed as a very necessary article of their provision, both domestic and agri cultural. If they were simply to cut it down, that is, to sever it from the tentacula, or roots, by which it adheres to the rocks, without deriving any nourishment from them, then it would not go out to sea, but would be collected in the bays and creeks, to probably the same extent as now, \u2014 and with a great reduction of labour to those to whom it is valuable as an article of domestic economy. After stormy weather, at all seasons of the year, there are quantities of this weed loosened from the rocks and cast upon the shore ; and the collecting of this gives partial em ployment to a number of \" wreckers,\" far more justifiable in their pursuit than those who were once but too nume rous upon other shores. When dried on the beach, this fucus becomes the principal fuel of all the Channel Islands ;"], [312, "24 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF and it is largely applied, both in its ashes and in substance, as a stimulating dressing to the land. Applied in substance it makes a better manure than when reduced to ashes, be cause many of its more valuable qualities are lost in the process of burning. But then the value of it, as fuel, is probably greater upon the whole, in Islands where there is no peat, little wood, and where coal is expensive. On some parts of the east coast of Scotland sea-weed is used as a manure \u2014 sometimes as a top-dressing to the fields, and, at others, it is made into compost with lime and other matters ; but it is rarely, if at all, used as fuel, even in those places where other fuel, for domestic purposes, is the least abundant. In many things, indeed, besides this, the Lowlanders, on the east coast of Scotland, have points of resemblance to the Channel Islanders, sufficiently numerous to prove that there must be some community of origin. There are many of the staple articles of food \u2014 the vegetable soups, the barley-meal cakes, and other preparations, which, according to the old school, in both localities, are nearly the same ; and the country people have similar industry and frugality ; and the same disposition to orderly conduct, and religious habits. Nor must we omit to notice, that those erections of rude stones \u2014 the \"cromlechs\" \u2014 resembling the dom-ringr, or circles of judgment, in Norway, are common in both places, in all situations where there are materials for their construction. These rude fabrics have been very ge nerally attributed to the Druids, or priests of the Celt\u00e6; and considered as the altars upon which they immolated human beings, in one of the cruel rites of their most un holy superstition ; but there seems to be no rational foun dation for any theory of the kind. The Celtic inhabitants of Britain were driven into the fastnesses of the mountains, in all probability, long before the Roman invasion ; and, if the cromlechs had been erections peculiar to them, and con nected with their superstitions, it is natural to suppose that they would have constructed others, in the mountain glens, where there is, in general, no want of materials. So far is"], [313, "25 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. this from being the case, however, that these structures are all near the shores, and many of them upon islands ; while, in the inland districts, they are exceedingly rare, or altoge ther unknown. In proof, or illustration, of this, we may mention, as a truth which has come within our own obser vation, that there are dozens of them on the southern shore of the Murray frith, in the last twenty miles below the once impassible shores of Loch Ness ; while, in the interior of the same country, there is not one. Farther to the south ward, they have, in general, been destroyed, partly for the sake of the stone in building, and partly because they en cumbered the land; but, where any remain, they are always near the coasts, and never in the interior of the country. There are some ancient monuments there, no doubt; but they are either single stones, or \" cairns,\" and none of them has the slightest resemblance to a cromlech. The name \"cromlech,\" which literally means crooked stone, appears to have been given to these ancient structures by another people than they who erected them ; and we have them in Norway, on the British coasts, and in the Channel Islands, toward the shore rather than in the inte rior. We know too, that, in Norway, they were not temples for the perpetration of cruel rites, but places of assembly for the tribe. These dom-ringr, or circles of judgment, were used at the \" folk-motes,\" or public assemblies, upon matters of importance, whether in passing judgment upon offenders, in deliberating on peace or war, or for any other public pur pose. In these assemblies, which appear to have been held in these circles of stones, and the stones erected for the very purpose, we can easily trace the genius of that free government Avhich had its origin among the northern nations, in contra-distinction to the despotism of the south ; and it is not a little instructive, or illustrative of this important point in human history, that the structure of municipal society in the Channel Islands, at this very day, bears a close resem blance to the ancient folk-mote in principle, though the"], [314, "26 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF practice has of course been a little altered in the lapse of so many ages. In those circles, as found in the Islands, of which some engraved specimens will be found among the illustrations of this work, there is generally a rude throne, or seat of honour, for the commander or chief; then, proxi mate to this, are other stones, less elevated, but still raised upon pillars, which were occupied by the subordinate chiefs and elders ; the people standing within the area, or outside, according to its extent, and their numbers. The matter for deliberation and decision was first propounded aloud to the assembly by the chief ; and, there is no doubt that his cha racter, and the estimation in which his wisdom and courage, which were the grand qualifications for this high office, were held, had some effect in the decision. That decision was never arbitrary, however ; for, as soon it was declared to the assem bly, the subordinate chiefs and elders proceeded to debate all the advantages and disadvantages of it, to the utmost power of their knowledge and eloquence ; and when their debate was at an end, the chief took the decision of the whole assembly, which was carried for, or against, the measure by acclamation, or by majority; and this their decision was final, without appeal, and equally binding on chief and people. It will be readily understood, that this mode of deciding matters of importance, gave more knowledge of policy, and a higher tone of character to the men of the north, than could be possessed by the merely passive slaves of southern despots. It was this union in knowledge, union of strength, and community of feeling, which gave the Northmen so much power, and enabled a comparative handful of them to establish themselves firmly on the shores of foreign lands, whatever might be the number of inhabitants there ; unless these inhabitants had a system as conducive to the strength of union as that of the invaders. The offering of human sacrifices,, and indeed the whole system of gross and groveling superstition, which is said to have prevailed among the Druids, is not only contrary to,"], [315, ""], [316, "THE GRAND ROCKS Guernsey DRUDJCAL STOl, -\u25a0\u25a0',, Ji.L.'tJ,,,/ fa t/tr Jivprtetor Ju'JfySiiiu. t',,tt.,j, &wl fatlttf Iilraiy.ffigA Stress"], [317, "27 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. but quite incompatible with, the spirit of such a people as the Northmen unquestionably were, and proATed themselves to be, wherever they extended their arms. The Celts, though their early history lies in the thick darkness of fable, appear to have come by a southern migra tion ; and, in every place where they have continued in any degree of purity, they have a southern air about them, and also an irritability of temper, and a Avant of purpose and unity, which make them quite a different people from the Northmen ; and, though they may be individually brave, they have always been the conquered people. That they have been driven westward before other races, is proved by the remnants of them which are found in Europe, and we believe also in Africa, though the fact there is not so clearly made out. We were informed, however, by an enterprising ship-master, who many years ago traded to the west coast of Africa, and sometimes to those parts which are little known, that, upon one occasion, there were dark-coloured men, with but little of the negro expression, that came doAvn to the shore ; and that they, and some Irishmen, and also some Bas Bretons, whom he had among his crew, could understand each other's language, though not very perfectly. It is true, that none of the common histories corroborate this ; but we have no good account of the coast of Africa, from the states of Morocco southward, to those on the Senegal and Gambia ; and it was along this part of the coast that our informant traded. Now, all the circumstances connected with the remains of the Celts tend to establish the fact of their reaching the west of Europe by the south, and not by the north. Indeed, in very early times, we believe that almost the whole of Europe, from the Alps to the Baltic, was quite impracticable to the passage of any tribe of people, either eastward or westward ; for Hungary and Poland appear, at that time, to have been one dense and marshy forest, shrowded in snow for the greater part of the year ; and so close, so swampy, and so pestilent, during the summer, that the hardiest race E"], [318, "28 POSITION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION. of savages would not have been able to pass through its wide extent. Within the period of history, the climatal changes there have been very great ; and the grape ripens, and the winters are comparatively mild now, in the same spots where wine was divided among the Roman legions by the hatchet. When they were driven into the western parts of Europe, where the Atlantic winds had more effect, the Celtic tribes, no doubt, ranged farther to the north; but there is a difficulty as to the time at which the Northmen spread southward ; although there is reason to believe that it was much earlier than the days of Julius C\u00e6sar ; and that they had established themselves around the fertile shores, and especially on the islands ; so that the cromlechs of Anglesey, and other places which the Druids once inha bited, are, in all probability, to be attributed to the North men, and were originally intended for purposes far different from those to which they are said to have been turned by the ministers of Druidical superstition. The importance of the remarks now made will be admit ted, when it is considered that those rude stones are the most ancient records to be found on the western shores of Europe, and on its islands. The small size and limited number upon the main-land of Hampshire gives no scope for offering any opinion on them in either of the former volumes ; and we can more pertinently introduce them here, because the Channel Islands have undergone fewer changes in their civil constitutions, than any part of Britain or the adjoining main-land ; and thus, these Islands are the only spots whose known history offers a very clear and rational connexion with those memorials of times long gone by. We do not of course assert, that the same Northmen peopled the Islands in the olden time as those who gave them the basis of their present constitution ; but there is enough of similarity for establishing a connexion in native land, and in race."], [319, "29 HISTORICAL OUTLINE. CHAPTER II. HISTORICAL OUTLINE. Though the few remarks we were led to make, in the close of the preceding chapter, do not come within the scope of that portion of history which is established by documents ; yet they serve as points of connexion between the indeter- minate period and the determinate one. The latter cannot, with propriety, be begun earlier than the time of the Romans ; although there is no doubt that all the Islands were inha- bited long before then ; and probably taken possession of by northern races, of similar origin to those which settled on the adjoining shores. The present names of the Islands throw but little light on their history. The substantive part of all the principal names is probably corrupted from some more ancient word ; but the termination \" ey,\" which is com- mon to the names of the three larger islands, is nothing more than the general name for an island ; and synonymous in its meaning with a \" spot,\" or, figuratively, an \" eye.\" Jersey is styled C\u00e6saria, in the Itinerary of Antoninus and some other Roman documents ; which would lead one to sup pose, that it was a place of some consequence in the times of the Romans. Some writers of the middle ages call it e 2"], [320, "30 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF Augia, and other names ; but it is scarcely necessary to enter into any investigation of these names, or to cite the monkish legends respecting miraculous and other conver sions to Christianity, which are not substantiated by any evidence that appears to be trustworthy. The common Ro man name of Guernsey, Avas Sernia ; and that of Alderney, Arica: but, though some of these names may have been corrupted into the present ones, by the very loose orthogra phy and pronunciation of the middle ages, nothing very conclusive can be drawn ; nor does any of them appear to be, in the least, descriptive of the appearance of that spot, of which it is the name. A few Roman coins have been found here, which have been considered as evidence of possession by the Romans ; but, we believe, they have been mostly of the lower empire. The first account, or tradition, which we have of any dis posal of these Islands, is a grant of them, or, at least, of Jersey, in 550, by Childebert, king of France, to Samp son, archbishop of Dol, in Armorica. The islands expressly mentioned in that grant, are Rimoul (Alderney), Augie (Jer sey), Surge (Guernsey), and Vosargie (Cerq) ; which, it is stated, were islands on the coast of Normandy. A century before this time, the Saxons had landed in Britain, and were establishing themselves in the south-eastern parts; and, as their conquest ofthe Isle of Wight, together with Cerdic's tak ing possession of Winchester, and being crowned there, hap pened about 20 years before the date of this grant ; there is, at least, an appearance of truth in the statement that Sampson was a British prelate, who had been expelled by the pagan Saxons, and found protection from the king of France ; as did many others of the British clergy \u2014 who were appointed to seize on other livings in the French territory. We need not wonder at this ; for the Romanized Britons had been much longer civilized, and, therefore, must have made greater advances in knowledge than the majority of the French, at that time. The legend of Sampson himself, or of Magloire, another Briton, his successor, need not be"], [321, "31 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. repeated ; suffice it to say, that, by their labours, and by those of some others, the Islands were converted to Christianity ; having, probably, in part, a French population at the time : and that it does not appear that the Saxons made any de scent here ; but that the French inhabitants of these Islands remained in comparative quietude for the space of nearly 300 years. About the middle of the ninth century, the Normans laid waste all the French coasts of the Channel, and established themselves with a firmness which the Franks could not resist. Now, if the Franks could not maintain their ground on the main-land, it is not likely that any defence could be offered to the Islands by them ; the consequence is, that, from the- middle of the ninth century to the year 912, they continued their depredations, increas ing in daring and power. There are some legendary tales of martyrdoms, and other atrocities having been committed by them in these Islands ; but such tales do not appear to have any solid foundation. We may remark, however, that the reputed murder of Helerius, by the Normans, about this time, gave importance to his name in the Islands ; and caused the town of St. Helier to be named after him. Whatever may have been the characters of some of the Norman adventurers, at this time, in these parts of Europe, it is certain that these people possessed leaders of great \u2022judgment, as well as bravery. Such was the character of Rollo, to whom Charles IV offered the dukedom of Nor mandy, and his daughter to wife ; provided that Rollo, and his Normans, should embrace Christianity, and cease to ha rass the remainder of France. Rollo agreed, formed a treaty of amity, held his dukedom as a nominal fief, governing it like a sovereign prince, and apparently with the greatest wisdom and prudence ; and, at the same time, he embraced the Christian religion, and was followed in this by his Nor man subjects, who henceforth lived upon friendly terms with what remained of the former population ; so that the Normans became among the most renowned people in Europe. The Channel Islands, forming part of Normandy,"], [322, "32 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF of course partook in this general prosperity ; and the Islanders still continue to revere the memory of Rollo, and mix his name up with some of their peculiar customs. Nothing tends more to show the estimation in which this founder of the dukedom of Normandy was held, or the extent to which he deserved it, than the Ha-Ro, or cry of the oppressed, which is not forgotten at the present time. This cry was a sort of direct appeal to the sovereign power ofthe state; and, as the ears of justice were supposed to be always open, and its hand ready to protect the oppressed, and punish the oppressor, it was not necessary that the cry should be raised in the presence of the duke, or any official person, but merely in the presence of witnesses. We are inclined to think that this cry is of much more ancient date than the days of this Rollo ; but the peculiar character for justice which he is admitted on all hands to have possessed, may naturally have caused it to be connected with his name, and rendered more sacred and binding by the connexion. The object of the cry is to stay the oppressor, or wrong-doer, while in the act of aggression, first, by warning him of the injustice he is about, and then making this appeal ; and if the party cried against persisted, in spite of the cry, then he was considered as acting contrary to law. The justice of the case was of course a matter of after decision ; but the cry was a command of suspension, not to be disobeyed ; and it served to bring the parties into court, in order that the matter in dispute between them might be decided. Here it may not be irrelevant to mention, that, in less than two centuries after, this cry was raised, not against the living indeed, but against the dead body of William the Conqueror, the lineal descendant, and not unworthy successor, of Rollo himself. The story, as told by the chroniclers, is briefly this: Wil liam, when erecting the abbey of St. Stephen at Caen, which he intended as the place of his own sepulture, had refused, or neglected, to remunerate one man for the site of a house which had been taken into the grounds occupied by the abbey. When the body of William was brought to"], [323, "33 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. its resting place, the grave for it, it seems, was dug in that part of the ground which had been taken, but not paid for. While those conducting the funeral were about to perform the rites, the former owner of the ground, or his son, came forward, forbidding the interment of the body ; claiming the ground as having been taken from him, and never paid for, and raising the \" Ha-Ro,\" for justice against the offender. Prince Henry, afterwards Henry I of England, ordered the compensation to be paid \u2014 the man was satisfied; and the bones of the Conqueror were laid in the grave without fur ther opposition. This little anecdote, the authenticity of which we see no reason to doubt, shows, not only that the Normans held the memory of Rollo in high veneration, but that their laws were good, and administered with impartial justice between man and man. It is to be understood that the cry is not for vengeance, but for equity, \u2014 not an appeal to the prince in his own person as a tyrant, but an appeal to him as the administrator of the laws, and the guardian of the rights of his subjects. This principle of government, which certainly has received no improvement in modern times, and which does not appear to admit of very much, in as far as the spirit of it is concerned, could not have emanated from any one com mander of a party of adventurers, however brave these may have been. It contains the whole essence of good regal go vernment ; and points directly to the folk-mote, or general council of the nation \u2014 of which we took some notice in the preceding chapter \u2014 as the only school in which it could have been brought to so much maturity, in such an age, and by a people who had not then embraced the Christian religion. There is no such principle as this to be traced among the Romans, the Saxons, or the Franks ; and it is, in all proba bility, much more owing to this necessity of doing all public acts in the sight and knowledge of the public, than to any thing else that can be named, that we are to attribute the high and chivalrous feeling of the Normans, in which they stand unrivalled. Whatever may be their other faults,"], [324, "34 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF ambition appears to be the leading one ; and the state of the world was such, that the Normans, after they came to the throne of England, were divided in their attention between two divided countries, and almost constantly involved in those hostilities which were inseparable from such a posi tion. Farther than this, we must not lose sight of the fact, that the very tone of even-handed justice which the Normans possessed, has been turned into an instrument of attack against them. The rulers whom they succeeded, whether on the one side of the water or the other, were ready to join with the unnatural institution of the monastic priesthood, in acts of injustice upon the people \u2014 in doing glory to the Almighty, by robbing his industrious creatures, and build ing abbeys, and fattening monks with the spoil ; and, as the Normans, though peculiarly splendid in the matter of church building, were too high-spirited for conniving at such mat ters, they naturally came in for their full share of maledic tion from the monastic chroniclers ; who were the only per sons by whom records were kept, and consequently the only ones who could vitiate the page of history. We need hardly remark, that the history of which we are now attempting an outline, is the history of the dukedom of Normandy, and not that of the Channel Islands ; as spots so small as they are, and so inaccessible in stormy weather, must have had very little influence one way or another upon the fate of the main-land ; but, as these Islands remained a steady part of the Norman dukedom while it lasted, it might be considered the only fragment of it which now re mains ; the histories cannot therefore be separated. Rollo was succeeded by a regular line of illustrious princes, who appear to have ruled their state, and promoted its interests, with more vigour than any other princes of Europe ; nor was it till they succeeded to the throne of England, and thus had their attention divided, that Normandy began to fall off; and, whatever may have been the influence of the Conquest upon England, the downfal of Normandy may be dated from this event."], [325, "35 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. According to the custom of giving new names to adults when they came to the font to profess Christianity, Rollo was christened Robert ; but he is little known by that name in history. His son William, called Long-sword, is reputed to have been a man of great personal size and strength, and a ruler worthy of following in the steps of his father. He died while his son, Richard the Fearless, was only ten years old; and the French king took advantage of Richard's minority, and endeavoured to break the league which had been volun tarily proposed by Charles. The Normans resisted, however ; and the young prince, being soon able to take the field, con ducted himself with so much bravery and judgment, that he triumphed over all his enemies, and was one of the most powerful princes of his time. It is impossible to say, whe ther this Richard may have had any ultimate views upon the crown of England, at that time worn by the imbecile Ethelred, while the people Avere harassed by the inroads of the Danes ; but he did give his daughter Emma in marriage to the Saxon king ; and this may be considered as the event which first prepared the Avay for the Norman Conquest. Emma is also famed in story as being the wTife of Canute the Dane, mother by him of Hardicanute, and of EdAvard the Confessor by her former husband ; nor is she less noto rious for her alleged intrigues with Alwin, bishop of Win chester, who had been sent over as her cavalier, by her father, Richard, and contrived to fight his way \u2014 to the mitre. Whatever of truth or falsehood may be in this is no concern of our's ; for she was safely conducted through the ordeal of the burning \u2014 or otherwise reddened \u2014 ploughshares, by two bishops ; and this, according to the order of the times, was a complete proof of innocence. Two dukes of the name of Richard succeeded to \" the Fearless \" in regular order of descent ; but the second of them dying without issue, after a reign of only two years, was suc ceeded by his brother Robert, surnamed the Magnificent, and apparently one of the greatest princes that ever wore a ducal crown. This Robert, who was the nephew of Emma, F"], [326, "36 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF afforded what assistance he could to the family of Ethelred, during the time that the Danes held the throne of England ; but as, Dane or Saxon, Emma carried her point of being queen, Robert the Magnificent had a somewhat difficult game to play. It is understood that, at one time, he had fitted out an army in aid of the English ; but the accounts add, that he got no farther than the island of Jersey. He was more successful in supporting Henry I of France, when his own mother intrigued against him ; and he also kept Edward the Confessor at his court during great part of the time of the Danish rule in England. It is highly probable that, during this time, the Confessor, who appears to have been a feeble-minded prince, had stipulated to commit his kingdom to the care of a prince, in whose keeping he himself had so long found an asylum : and this residence of the Confessor at the Norman court, may be regarded as the second great step toward the Norman Conquest. As the Danish line became extinct in the son of Canute, Edward mounted the throne without opposition ; and reigned in peace, piety, and bounty to the monks. Edward dying without issue, and the next heir to the crown being a mere infant, Harold, the ambitious son of Godwin, earl of Kent, laid claim to the crown ; and this led to the invasion by William, the success of his attempt, and the extinction of Normandy as a separate and independent state. Robert may thus be considered as really the last duke of Normany. He had no legitimate son ; but his natural son, William, was unquestionably a prince of high talent ; though under him the state of Normandy, and of the Channel Islands as forming part of Normandy, underwent so great a change. That this event had any great influence upon the internal condition of the Islands, we have no reason to sup pose ; but it is certain that the conquest of England was a powerful cause of weakening and degeneracy to Normandy. The flower of the Normans came with William to the battle of Hastings ; and very many of them, having obtained estates and honours in England, remained there, and, to a certain"], [327, "37 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. extent, depopulated their native country, \u2014 more in spirit perhaps than numbers. This is not the place in Avhich to estimate the gain and loss, either of England or Normandy, which resulted from the Conquest, though we are inclined to think that it was injurious to both. On the Channel Islands, however, its effect, if at all felt, was very trifling, until Normandy fell anew under the dominion of France, and the Islands remained part of the dominions of the crown of England, with little alteration, however, of their Norman laws and usages. On the death of the Conqueror, who was killed by an accident while riding through the town of Mante, which he had set on fire, his three sons appear to have had very different dispositions, and very different vieAvs. Robert, the eldest son, who was of course duke of Normandy immedi ately on the demise of his father, in what manner soever the English succession might be settled, appears to have been a rambling character, more ambitious of the mere display of valour and greatness, than studious of the means by which these are to be secured. He was on his travels at the time when the accident happened to his father ; and this favoured the ambition of Rufus, who, hastening over to England, secured the throne of that kingdom. Robert soon returned to Normandy to fight for that which appeared to be his legitimate right ; but the fighting, though it cost a great deal on both sides, did not promise to lead to any definite issue. In consequence of this, Robert held Normandy, and Rufus England, with an agreement that, if one died before the other, without issue, the two states should be again joined in the survivor. The short reign of Rufus. is well known ; and, during that reign, short as it was, the project of re-gaining the Holy Land from the Infidels was set on foot ; and Robert engaged heartily in that enterprise, and again drew with him the flower of Normandy, leaving that state, much more weakened than it had been by the army which William led to the conquest of England. The expence of this expedition, which would be accounted a f\"2"], [328, "38 HISTORICAL OUL1NE OF most quixotic one in our degenerate days, was more than Robert's exchequer would bear ; and therefore he borrowed money of Rufus upon the mortgage of Normandy. While battling bravely in Syria, Robert learned of the death of his brother Rufus, and hurried home to take possession both of the kingdom and the dukedom which had been mortgaged. He had now a double right to both : first, his original and legitimate claim as the eldest son of the Conqueror, and secondly, the agreement between him and Rufus, whereby both states, mortgage and all, ought in justice to have revert ed to him. For the realization of these, however, Robert was again a little behind his time ; for, upon his arrival from the Holy Land, he found that Henry, his younger brother, who seems to have been a very crafty and political character, had been elected king of England, at Winchester, on the very day of the funeral of Rufus : and Henry's subsequent conduct to Robert shews that he may have had some little influence in directing the course of the arrow which killed his brother Rufus in the New Forest. This is a part of the subject which, however, it would be unpleasant to probe ; and the eloquence and learning of Henry Beauclerc, together with certain other arts which he is said to have practised very extensively, both in England and Normandy, made his party very strong. To procure additional strength he left no means unperformed ; for, almost immediately on his election, he resorted to Winchester, obtained investment with the regalia of the Confessor, and bound himself, by a solemn and voluntary charter, to rule the nation with justice and equity. Soon after this, he shewed his political tactics in the choice of a queen ; haAdng selected Matilda, daughter of Malcolm of Scotland and Margaret, the grand-daughter of Edmund Ironside \u2014 and thus sprung of the old Saxon line of England as well as the Scottish. This Matilda had been educated under her maternal aunt, Christina, at the convent of Romsey ; and had subsequently resided at Winchester, in the abbey of St. Mary, wearing the veil, but not having taken the vow of celibacy. After a little coquetting with the"], [329, "39 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. titled clergy, who broke the subject to her, Matilda consented to become a queen, and Henry considered himself secure in the throne, by every kind of means that could be taken, \u2014 saving and excepting the one little matter of his elder bro ther being alive, and the rightful heir. Robert shewed bravery enough in the asserting of his claim ; but Henry was in possession of power and the purse, and these were exerted to the utmost against his ill-used brother. It is understood that bribery, to a large extent, was practised, both in England and Normandy ; and, indiscriminately, towards priests and laymen, according as they had influence, and chose to sell it to the usurper. It is highly probable that Henry made a better king than Robert would have done ; but that is a point which was never settled, in the only way it could be : and, as faithful historians, we must call parties and practices by their right names; and, according to this, the only proper nomenclature of history, Henry was a usurper, and a very unjustifiable and cruel one, in the end, if not from the beginning. Having got Robert into his possession, he sent him to England, had his eyes put out, and shut him up in the castle of Cardiff, where the cruelty practised upon him, and the ignominious treatment he had met with at his brother's instigation, caused him soon to die of a broken heart, and he was buried in the cathedral at Gloucester, with only a wooden monument to his memory. This Robert was the last of the Norman dukes who had sovereignty independently of the kings of England and France ; and, as his heritage passed over to his brother Henry, Normandy, and the Channel Islands as part of Normandy, were ready to become part of the dominions of the king of England or France, according as the chances of war might turn up : and, as the separation of it from France had taken place, when the Norman dukes were strong, and the king of France weak, and, as there was now, strictly speaking, no duke, it was not very difficult to anticipate how the main-land, the substantial part of the province, would ultimately go."], [330, "40 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF Henry, a son of the Conqueror, retained the hereditary partiality for Normandy, and often went there ; but, at the same time, as Matilda, the good queen, had brought him only one son, though he had a supplement in other quarters, he was anxious that the crown should proceed in this branch ; and so, while his son was yet a youth, he married him to a daughter of the earl of Anjou, and immediately created him duke of Normandy. Having settled matters in France, he took shipping at Harfleur, along with the retinue, the new-married couple being in another vessel ; but there appears to have been delay and mis-management in the sail- ing of the vessel, for it was wrecked, and the prince lost his life within a short distance of the coast from which he sailed ; and with him ended the very temporary renewal of the dukes of Normandy, and the hopes of Henry in being succeeded on the English throne by an heir male of his own. This may be said to be almost the last stage of the indepen- dence of continental Normandy, and the separation of the Islands from continental Europe, and their adherence to the English crown. The death of this prince occurred before the cruelty of his brother had broken the heart of Robert in the Welsh prison ; but the crafty Henry did not relent at this, which, in those superstitious days, might have been looked upon as a visitation of the crimes of the father upon the head of the son. Instead of nominating the son of Robert as his successor, Henry married again, but had no heir ; and thus, his only descendant Avas Matilda, or Maud, who had been married to Henry V, emperor of Germany, which procured her the title of \" the Empress,\" though she subsequently married Plantagenet, earl of Anjou, by whom she had a son, who ultimately came to the throne of England, as Henry II. The Empress, though such appears to have been the wish of Henry, never came to the English throne ; and, we believe, that though she had, she would not have been legitimate sovereign of Normandy, and consequently, not of the Channel Islands. Stephen, a grandson of the Conqueror, through the female line, contrived, though witb"], [331, "41 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. much difficulty, and many reverses, to keep possession of the crown while he lived ; and Normandy, and especially the Channel Islands, appear to have been but little affected by the troubles of those days. Upon the death of Stephen, Henry II, the son of the Empress, ascended the English throne, and brought with him an immense accession of land in France, both by inheritance by his father, and by marriage with the heiress of Guienne ; by which acquisitions his French territories occupied nearly half the surface, and the whole sea-coast of that country, south almost to the Pyre nees. It is understood that the first blow to the ecclesiasti cal importance of the abbey of St. Helier, in Jersey, was given by the Empress, who appointed the abbot to the superintendence of a new foundation, which she had erected at Cherbourg ; and this was followed up by her son, who con verted St. Helier into a mere cell appertaining to that founda tion, which led to its total suppression in the time of Henry V. Notwithstanding the vast extent of territory of which Henry was the nominal master, the continental parts of it were so disjointed, and his own habits so extravagant, that, though he died possessed of considerable property, he died in misery. C\u0153ur de Lion, the son of Henry, was the last of the English kings who held undisputed sway over the dutchy of Normandy, and of the Channel Islands as part of that dutchy. This prince died without issue, and his next brother being dead, and having left a son who was very young, namely, Arthur duke of Bretagne, the kingdom was seized upon by his third brother, John. Upon this, a violent feud arose between Arthur, or rather his mother, Constance, on the one side, and John on the other, as to who should possess the kingdom. In this state of things, the interference of Philip Augustus, king of France, was appealed to, and assistance prayed by Constance for the cause of her son ; and this appears to have turned the desire of the French kings, more strongly than they had previously been, to the regaining of the dukedom of Normandy. John had Arthur,"], [332, "42 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF his nephew, in his power ; but did not remove him out of the way during the life of his own mother, Eleanor; but, upon her demise, Arthur speedily \"vanished,\" as it is gently termed ; and this cause of dispute was at an end. The treacherous conduct, and the general worthlessness of John, made him disliked by the whole of his subjects ; and detested by the people of Normandy, who, in consequence of this, invited the king of France to take possession of their province as a favour to them, rather than opposed him as a conqueror. The consequence was, that the whole continental possessions of the English crown passed from under its dominion in the reign of John ; and the subsequent attempts of the English upon France, which were usually more gallant than profit able, were not so much for the restoration of the dukedom, as for purposes of general conquest in France. When Normandy was lost to the English, the people of the Channel Islands still adhered to them, as the only rem nant of the Norman dutchy ; and it is, as a fragment of this dutchy, and not as an integral part of England, that they belong to the British crown at the present day. These events, which, though they had their consummation in the time of John, and were brought to a crisis by the conduct of that very unworthy wearer of the crown, had been in pro gress, even from the time of the Conquest probably, and certainly ever after the conduct of the sons of William to ward each other. This event, which was the extinguish ment of Normandy as an independent state, gives a new character to the Channel Islands ; for they then became the dutchy of Normandy, and the only territories which the English monarch holds upon nearly the same tenure as the dukedom was held by the descendants of Rollo. No doubt, the most important public occurrences that have subsequently taken place in the Islands have been resistances of French invasions, and very brave and resolute adherence to the monarchy of England ; but still, as they are parts of the dominions of the monarch only, and not within the general constitution of the country, the loss of Normandy"], [333, "43 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. gives them a history of their own, as the last representative fraction of that once powerful dukedom. Strong by nature, resolute in the conduct of their inhabi tants, and probably not offering prize enough for the French rulers, who found abundant occupation elseAvhere, these Islands repelled their French invaders, even in the days of John ; and, although the adulation usually lavished upon kings, whether they may happen to have any title to it or not, caused these successful resistances to be placed to the credit of the monarch, they were, in reality, owing to the natural strength of these little Islands, and the invincible spirit of their brave inhabitants ; and,, down to the present time, they have, through weal and through woe, through good report and through bad, adhered to that power, which they look upon as the representative of Rollo ; from whom, we are led to believe, the laws, which noAV form the basis of their local government, emanated at the first. Of the laws of these Islands we shall speak after wards ; but we may mention, in the mean time, that, instead of King John making any effort for the preservation, under his government, of any portion of his former Norman sub jects, whether on the main-land or in these Islands, he was passive to fatuity in himself, and in cruelty to them ; and, it was only after the desperate valour of the Islanders had made them successfully resist all attempts to sever them from the crown of England, that this monarch shewed a little, and but a little, gratitude ; and it may farther be re marked, that, though he gave up the main-land to the king of France, he never made a formal renunciation of the Islands. In the reign of Henry III, it is reputed, that the French Avere defeated by an English fleet, commanded by the governor of the Channel Islands. In the time of Edward I, other unsuccessful attempts were made by the French to obtain possession. Edward II's close conne xion with France caused, a suspension during his reign ; but, at that time, the invasion of the local constitution of the inhabitants, and the introduction of English judges and pro- G"], [334, "44 HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF cesses at law, occasioned, perhaps, more bitterness than would have resulted from an attempted invasion. In the reign of Edward III, the attacks of the French were renewed, not only upon the Islands, but upon the south coast of England, where they destroyed the town of Southampton. They, at the same time, obtained possession of Guernsey ; but Jersey set them at defiance. The defeat of the French squadron off Sluys put an end to, or, at all events, greatly reduced, the maritime power of France ; and, after a time, Guernsey was again recovered, and the sole possession of the Islands secured to England. In the latter years of Edward, after the Black Prince was no longer able to take the field, the French reneAved their attacks as before. They made themselves masters of Guernsey ; but Jersey stood out, and after various delays, the castle was not taken. During the wars which stained the time of the unfortunate Richard II and the treacherous Henry IV, the successes were various ; but, during the splendid, though effectless, victories of Henry V in France, the Islands were in a state of comparative safety. In the latter part of the reign of Henry VI, the intrigues of the different parties gained the French possession of Mount Orgueil castle, which had always been the bulwark of strength against them ; but the Islanders remained unconquerable, at least in spirit, in spite of all intrigues. They even besieged the French in their strongholds, and forced them to surrender ; an exertion of valour, which is, not inaptly, inserted in some documents of the island, as one which deserved to be \" held in perpetual remembrance.\" After a number of vicissitudes, during part of which the Islands appear to have been overlooked, though always bravely defended by their inhabitants, whenever such defence was necessary, Henry VII, who had staid sometime in Jersey, during his sojourn abroad, made some additions or ratifications of the insular laws. In the reign of Henry VIII, the historians of Jersey complain of some saucy con duct on the part of the governors, which they suppose was screened, if not encouraged, by Cardinal Wolsey. In the"], [335, "45 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. time of Edward VI, the French obtained possession of Cerq ; but they were utterly repulsed from the other islands ; and Cerq was regained during the reign of Mary. The reign of Elizabeth was a time of peace and prosperity to the Islands ; and her ministers took occasion to repair and strengthen the various fortifications. The policy of James was nearly the same ; and, during these reigns, the state of the Islands was comparatively prosperous ; and the reformed religion was fully established in the churches. In the reign of Charles, the fortifications were strengthened ; and, during the civil war, the Islanders for a long time maintained their fealty to the monarch, regardless of the poAver of the parlia mentary party, with which, indeed, they had little conne xion. The Islanders were among the foremost to proclaim Charles II, and he, for some time, found shelter there ; but the events of the interregnum, and of the early parts of this reign, belong rather to English History than to that of these Islands. In more recent times, some gallant stands have been made upon these little spots of land; and, it is some satisfaction to add, that all attempts at invasion and subju gation by foreigners have always been repelled. Some of the most decided of these were made during the American war, after France had taken part with the colonies ; and, toward the close of the year 1780, a party of the French landed, got possession of the commander-in-chief, and appeared, for a time, to carry everything before them. The troops and native militia were, however, marshalled and brought into action by the gallant Major Pierson, who fell early in the contest, which was carried on in the town of St. Helier ; but, notwithstanding his early fall, the example which he had set, by stimulating the men, and sustaining the old invincible courage of the Islanders, ensured victory and deliverance, and entailed present disgrace and lasting obloquy upon the pusillanimous Major Corbet, the first in command. The French were repulsed, their commander mortally wounded, and the rest surrendered as prisoners of war. This is one of the recent events upon which the in- g 2"], [336, "46 HISTORICAL OUTLINE. habitants of the Islands love to dwell, and may justly dAvell, with proud remembrance ; and with it, the public events of the Islands, as far as peace and war are concerned, may be said to close : for the subsequent hostilities have been upon too mighty a scale for rendering these lovely little Islands objects of ambition; and therefore, during the last sixty years, the inhabitants have \" sat every man under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, with none to make them afraid ;\" and the prosperity of the Islands has been in the full ratio of their tranquillity."], [337, "47 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS. CHAPTER III. LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS. In former times, when the sole defence of these Islands was left to their own native militia \u2014 who, upon many trying occasions, proved no unwilling or incompetent defenders both in preventing invasion, and expelling the invaders after they had effected a landing \u2014 the military government ranked high in the estimation of the Islanders. The head of this government having originally been the duke of Nor- mandy, or a deputy appointed by his authority, it naturally fell into the hands of the English sovereign, when Nor- mandy ceased to be an independent state, and these Islands adhered to England. Hence, the governor, appointed by the king in council, Avithout any reference whatever to the British houses of legislature, was, and continues to be, military commander of the Islands; but. as soldiers have, in later times, been introduced into the Islands, the military go- vernment has undergone a slight alteration ; because the royal authority is, of course, greater than that of the governor, Avhich that authority appoints for the execution of its plea sure. From these circumstances, service in the militia is not so popular, and, therefore, not so honorable, in the Is-"], [338, "48 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF lands as it formerly was. But, the power of calling out the militia, for discipline as well as for active service, may be said to amount to a general military prescription. All males between 17 and 65 are liable to serve ; and the consequence is, that the militia bear a high proportion to the whole num ber of the inhabitants ; and they are, or used to be, well disciplined and furnished with the materiel of war \u2014 having a train of artillery, and all other requisites for defence. Oc casionally, more especially of late years, the governor, or deputy governor, and the inhabitants of the Islands, have not, at all times, exactly understood each other. This might be expected, from a people so high-spirited, and so jealous of their ancient privileges, as the Channel Islanders. They have remained faithful to England ; and, for their part, stand in the very same relation to it, as they did to the court of Caen, when Normandy was entire and flourishing ; but there is no denying, that the court of England stands in a different re lation to them. It is estranged from them by distance in space, and by occupation with the greater affairs of a most extensive and unwieldy dominion, partly situated in every quarter of the globe. Therefore, it cannot possibly pay so much attention to the people of these Islands ; nor can its ministers, embroiled in the mazes of a most extensive and very different policy, thoroughly understand the wants and Avishes, and rights and privileges, of the Islanders. Hence, it will sometimes happen, that the parties nominated by royal authority, shall be British rather than insular in their feelings, and thus attempt to extend British laws and ma nagement to a length inconsistent with the Norman inde pendence of the Islanders. No absolute rupture has, we believe, arisen from this cause ; but it has often produced ill-blood, and laid the foundation of much party feeling. We have little, however, to do with these trifling jarrings, \u2014 which will occur when different systems come into collision among men who have to act together in the government of any country, great or small. Therefore, we shall shortly notice the portions of the government that have been main-"], [339, "49 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. tained in the 'Islands since the Norman times ; and, as such, are quite different from anything in Britain. The laws of the constitution which King John ratified, were not substantially altered by subsequent monarchs ; and the purport of the Avhole is to preserve the ancient customs and privileges ; the full illustration of which would require a volume. Among others, however, we may men tion one, which is worthy of being held sacred. This is a law of immunity to all merchant-vessels, of what nation so ever, resorting to these Islands. This privilege was first formally granted and acknowledged \u2014 though it appears to haA'e been in use long before \u2014 by Edward IV and Louis XI, and ratified by a papal bull ; and the gist of it is, that no merchant-vessels whatsoever can lawfully be made prize of within sight of the Channel Islands: aud those belonging to the nations of the contracting parties, France and Eng land, are subject to punishment, by the laws of their own countries, if they invade the sanctuary of those Islands. This privilege was recited at full length, in a charter by Elizabeth ; but how it would stand with nations not con senting, or such as have risen to power in modern times, is a point upon which we cannot venture an opinion. The foundation of the local laws is understood to be the customs of Normandy, as they existed before the days of King John. The record of these is called Mancel's Insti tutes ; but the original appears to be lost ; and, it is possible, that there may be French innovations in what are now con sidered as the most authentic transcripts. The substance of this book is, however, preserved in memory, and it forms the statute law of the Islands ; and, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, it is understood to be unalterable. In addition to this, there is the unwritten law of custom and usage ; the authority of which, like that of the same in England, is unknown, but which is venerated for its anti quity. In addition to these, there are various orders in council, issued by the king of England ; but, we believe it is understood, that such orders ought not to invade the spi-"], [340, "50 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF rit of the old Norman law, as embodied in Mancel's Insti tute. Precedents, that is former decisions, enrolled in court, constitute one other part of the laAv. This is to be regarded as the addendum made by practising laAvyers; and, it is certainly the key which opens widely the flood gates of litigation. There are, however, few systems of civil laAv, in which it does not obtain ; and yet, as the pre cedent is as likely to be Avrong as right, it is a most unsafe ground of judgment. For the administration of those laws, baillies, or presi dents of the court, are appointed by the king : one for Jer sey, and the other for Guernsey. Then, to each court there are twelve jurats or judges, who are chosen by the people, and that for life ; so that they are exempted from royal, or other authority, Avhich might influence their decisions. All heads of families, paying local rates, have voices in the choosing of the judges ; and they may choose whomsoever they please ; for there is no provision that the judge shall necessarily be acquainted even with the laws and usages of the Island. To us this appears a little singular ; and yet, it is possible, that a judge appointed from the bar, may have a great bias toward deciding after the manner of the bar, that is, estimating the law of the case far higher than the justice. It is not our province to offer any opinion on this subject; but the common notion is that, if the electors were not quite so numerous, the judges would be chosen less upon party grounds, and more competent to a right discharge of their functions ; and, that the people would not be so divided, and set against each other by party spirit, as they are at the present time. The baillie of the court, or his deputy, \u2014 for he also may appoint a deputy, must be present at the court, and holds the same place in it, as Ave have said the chief held at the ancient assemblages of the people : he is the organ of the court, brings the business before it, keeps order, sums up the proceedings, and pronounces sentence ; but he has no vote unless in the case of the jurats being equally divided."], [341, "51 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. When there is a majority, he is understood to follow that majority and give effect to its opinion. The bar consists of an attorney and solicitor-general, high-sheriff, clerk or keeper of the rolls, advocates, under-sheriffs, and an usher \u2014 \u25a0 to keep the rest in order. The whole array of this court are solemnly sworn to do equal justice between man and man, and to maintain the laAvs and liberties of their country invio late. In order to obtain a decision it is not necessary that the whole twelve jurats should be present, though we believe less than three do not make a legal court ; and, in order to ensure their attendance, by increasing the labour if they do not, a cause decided before a smaller number on the bench may be brought in again before a larger. From the decision of a full bench, in any case where the authority of the court is competent, there is no appeal in the island ; and, as is the case in some of the colonies, the only appeal is to the king in council ; and the case is heard and decided at the cock-pit. These judges have no authority in cases of treason ; and, as the institutes do not clearly define the difference between murder and manslaughter, an appeal lies to the privy council in such cases ; but, in all other criminal matters, the decision of the jurats and sentence of the baillie are final. The same judges form four different courts : the court of Heritage, the court of Chattels, the court of the Roll, and the Saturday court. The court of Heritage is the most solemn, and the principal court of the four. As its name im ports, it takes cognizance only of causes connected Avith real property \u2014 its regulations, and the recovery of rents, but not arrears. It is held within La Cohue royale, or the royal judgment hall \u2014 that for Jersey, in the town of St. Helier, being a handsome edifice. The day of meeting of this court, at the commencement of each of the three annual terms, is a solemn and important day. No ordinary excuse is taken for the absence of the jurats, and the baillie and governor resident are understood also to be there. These enter the hall, preceded by the royal mace, and guarded by officers H"], [342, "52 LAAVS AND INSTITUTIONS OF with partizans or halberts. All landholders too, who hold directly in fee of the crown, are considered as members of this court and obliged to be present \u2014 the governor, or his deputy, answering as holder of such fiefs as are in the royal possession ; and the court cannot be held unless seven out of the twelve jurats are present. The advocates renew their oaths at this court ; political ordinances are made, con firmed, continued, or annulled, as may be, before this assembly ; and the revenue officers give an account of all forfeitures, and other casual emoluments that have accrued to the crown since the last meeting of the court. All these matters of business being settled, the entire posse adjourn to the upper hall over the court-house, and partake of a dinner, provided for them by the receiver of the king's revenues ; and thus the holders of royal fiefs in the Islands boast the high honour of thrice a year dining with the king. Tuesdays and Thursdays during term are the days of meeting for ordi nary business ; and there must be at least three jurats present, otherwise there is no court ; and even so small a number as this, leaves the case open to a fresh hearing, upon payment of very moderate fees by the party claiming it. The court of Chattels takes cognizance of all matters re lating to moveables, arrears of rent, and debts and credits not affecting heritable property ; and it is also the insolvent or bankrupt court of the island. A person, whose affairs are involved, goes before this court and renounces, or gives up, his whole estate, over which the court has authority ; and this is somewhat equivalent to paying into court. When it is done ; three warning preparations and one peremptory one are given, commanding all creditors to come into court ; and if they do not obey the last warning they lose their claims. When they have appeared, and inserted their claims on a roll, then the adjudication proceeds in this way : the last creditor is asked if he will take the estate out of court and satisfy all who stand above him ; and if he agrees, the estate is his, and the matter is at an end. If he refuses, he is understood to give up his claim ; and the question is"], [343, "THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. 53 put to the next, and repeated upwards in the regular order of the roll, until so many are struck off, that some one finds the estate worth taking and satisfying those that are above him. Of course there is a scramble as to who shall get first on the roll among the creditors ; and this is a quick way of settling such matters, if not a very equitable one. Arrears of rent occupy a large portion of the time of this court ; aud both these and local bonds may affect real property. This is also the criminal court, criminal trials being heard on the first day ; and if the crime is capital there must be seven jurats present ; but in misdemeanors three are sufficient. The court of the Roll sCam de Billet J is an extraor dinary court, held for the relief of the two preceding ones in cases of minor importance. In this court the causes are taken in the order of a roll, and thus the suitors are not kept long in waiting. This court meets out of term. The Saturday court is a branch of the former ; chiefly held for crown cases, and cases in which jurats are parties ; these last not taking their place in the billet along with the others ; but, besides these, maritime cases, breaches of the peace, and all other matters which require instant attention and decision, come before this court. For the local execution of the decrees of these courts, and for general administration, there are officers in every parish, chosen by the voice of the people in the same man ner as the jurats ; of these, the chief is the constable, or head parochial magistrate, who has two substitutes, twelve officers, and a messenger, under him. In parochial meet ings, the local magistrates preside in secular matters, even though a jurat or jurats be present ; and the minister pre sides if the matter is clerical. We may mention, that a regular order of the royal court issues twice a year to the officers of all the parishes, allowing the people to cut and collect sea-weed for a stipulated length of time. These orders are generally issued for March, and in the latter part of Summer ; but a certain license in time of commencement is given as may suit the convenience of the parties. Upon h 2"], [344, "54 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF receiving the order, the constable summons a parish meeting, at which the day is fixed ; and all hands join in this most important harvest of the sea \u2014 order being kept, and equity preserved, between man and man, by the magistrate, and other parish authorities. The weed, which is Jetsum, or cast upon the beach, is free to the finder ; and, consequently, subject to no regulation. Such is a very brief outline of the sources and administration of Channel Island law. The Convention of States is an assemblage of the whole people, called together as occasion requires ; and, it is a sort of little parliament ; and every one is present, either person ally, or by some representative, in Avhose appointment he has a vote. The jurats are a sort of lords temporal; the clergy are lords spiritual ; and the constables and parochial magistrates are commoners : and the whole people of the island to which the convention belongs, or belonging to the bailliwick of which it forms part, are bound by the decisions of the convention. This convention, like the parliament of England, cannot assemble, unless called by the governor, or his deputy ; but he has no voice in the proceedings after it has met. The baillie is the president, or speaker; and the principal officers of the crown are alloAved to be present. From what has been stated, it will be seen that the clergy are the only members of this conven tion, not directly chosen by the voice of the people; and it is specially provided, that a clergyman who is a foreigner, must be naturalized before he is admitted to the convention. The governor may summon the assembly of his own plea sure, in matters concerning the royal service ; and he is ex pected, but not absolutely compelled, at least till fifteen days have elapsed, to summon the assembly at the instance of the magistrates, if the local interests require it ; and of these interests, the magistrates, not the governor, are the judges. The form and proceedings of this convention are secured by the constitutions, as Avell as those of the courts for the administration of justice. Among other powers, this com-ention of estates possesses that of levying contri-"], [345, "55 the channel islands. butions for public purposes ; but no new regulation made by it, can remain in force more than three years, without it has received the sanction of the king ; although it may be renewed, by subsequent votes, as often as shall be found necessary. The privileges which the people of these Islands enjoy are considerable ; and they are mostly handed down from the Norman times, or have arisen out of the peculiar relation in which these Islands stand to the English crown. Being, in this respect, a \" peculiar \" of the monarch ; and the mo narch having no power to levy one shilling upon the British people, without the sanction of the House of Com mons, the said house can impose no customs, duty, or other tax whatsoever, upon the Islanders ; neither can a local act of parliament be obtained, for carrying any matter in the Islands into effect, whether that matter may be a general improvement, or otherwise. Thus, no one has a right to tax the inhabitants of these Islands, except their own local conventions : the solitary exception, we believe, being a small duty on public-house licenses. The office of governor, as representative of the king, is a mere sinecure, for which he receives about half the crown revenue. By far the greater part of this revenue consists of tithes, and the rents of crown lands \u2014 the tithes being by much the largest item, and having belonged to the crown ever since the time of Henry VIII. The reason why the king is so large a tithe owner in these Islands is, that the revenues and patronage of all the Islands were in the hands of the Norman abbots ; and, when Henry seized the monastic property, of course the whole of these were included in it; and, as none of them, individually, is of such value, as very strongly to tempt the cupidity of any courtier, it does not appear that, even the most giving monarch has been solicited to part with any of them. The privilege of asylum to shipping within sight of the Islands, together with the want of poAver to impose custom house duties, farther than may be necessary for local"], [346, "56 laws and institutions of purposes \u2014 and it is not to be supposed that the people will injure their OAvn trade in this way \u2014 gives to the Channel Islands great commercial advantages ; although the diffi culties and dangers of the navigation, in a great measure, confine the carrying trade to such as are well acquainted with the locality. We know not whether it is or it is not to be accounted a privilege ; but it is certain, that the clergy of these Islands are much less a people apart from their parishioners, than they are in places where rich livings attract men of ambi tious vieAvs. They at least have some official duties which bring them into fellowship with the laity. The principal of these is in the convention above-mentioned, which is made up of jurats, clergymen, and constables or parish magistrates, all in equal numbers. King John had, as is said, proposed to transfer the churches of these Islands to the see of Exe ter ; and Henry VII obtained tAvo papal bulls \u2014 one to make the transference to Salisbury, and another to make it to Winchester ; but, though the papal authority was granted in both cases, neither of those bulls was carried into effect ; nor was it, until the reign of Elizabeth, subsequently to the tithes becoming a crown revenue, that the transfer was made ; and, it is very probable, that, after the tithes passed to the crown, nobody cared very much how the superintendence of the churches went. The Norman abbots had not only acquired the tithes from the greater parts of the Islands, but also the possession of some of the best manors ; and, when the seizure by Henry deprived them of these, the ministers of the Islands, to all of whom they had left only very wretched pittances, were absolved from the strongest tie which the Romish church could have upon them, while the influential members of that church lost all interest in them. We have no room to quote the original documents ; but these, especially for the island of Jersey, show how very heavy the grasping hand of these greedy monastics was laid upon that which ought to have supported those who minister ed at the altar. In these documents, the tithe is generally"], [347, "57 the channel islands. expressed in sheaves, meaning of course the tenth sheaf of all sorts of grain; and it is not uncommon to find some abbot getting half the sheaves, and some two abbesses get ting a fourth each, while the officiating clergyman had only a portion of the alms, or poor-rate, not amounting to above thirty or forty shillings for his yearly support. Under such circumstances we need not wonder that the Reformation took effect very readily in these Islands. Under Mary it was nominally subverted, though the spirit of the Islanders resisted any of the persecutions of that cruel reign. Nor is it a little remarkable that, at the very time when the most illustrious members of the English church were suf fering martyrdom for the sake of their consciences, a Romish priest was hanged in Jersey, by a most just decision of the local court. This man, Richard Averty, was a most deter mined enemy to clerical marriage ; but, in order to set the example of how that might be avoided, he kept a concubine. This concubine was delivered of a child, which was mur dered, all unknown to the woman, by its unnatural father. The civil authorities immediately laid hold of him and brought him to trial ; and, though Paulet, the popish dean of the island, and a known bigot and zealot in his vocation, exerted all his energy and influence to have the criminal transferred to the court of the bishop of Constance, there to be dealt with in the usual tenderness of apostolic law to an erring brother, the jurats of the island stood manfully upon that ancient prerogative, which had been handed down to them from the Norman times; and had him fairly and openly tried, and speedily hanged, as he deserved, despite of fulminations of the dean and bishop. Nor, can we refrain from noticing, that, amid all difficulties, religious or politi- cal, the spirit of the Islanders has always risen fully equal to the occasion, and invariably won them glory, and very generally victory. It will easily be imagined, that the people of Jersey returned gladly to the open profession of the Protestant faith \u2014 which faith they had not altogether concealed in the reign of her predecessors \u2014 during the reign"], [348, "58 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF of Elizabeth; and it was probably their readiness in this way which induced her to annex them to the diocese of Win chester. About the middle of the sixteenth century, when persecution raged so violently in France, and in which the best interests of that kingdom were so seriously injured, for unworthy and cruel purposes, a number of the Protestant clergy took refuge in the Islands, bringing with them the Presbyterian form of church government. The people of the Islands expressed a wish, that is, they prayed the queen, to permit this form of religion in all the churches ; but, granting it to the church of St. Helier it was refused to all the rest. The spirit extended, however, in spite of the pleasure of the queen, so that when James came to the throne he found that particular form of worship so complete ly established that he confirmed it; but this measure having been attended with wrangling and disturbance in the Islands, the episcopal form was restored, and has so conti nued to the present time ; though a portion of the spirit in troduced at that time still remains among the humbler classes of the people, especially those of the interior. We know not whether the law of tenure, which chiefly prevails in those Islands, ought to be regarded as a privilege or a disadvantage; it is gavel-kind, or an equal division among all the heirs who stand in the same degree of affinity to the testator ; and, that it should be so very general in these Islands, is rather a curious matter, and contrary to what many are in the habit of supposing. It has generally been believed, that gavel-kind, as well as almost all of what are called popular customs and laws in England, are of Saxon origin ; but here, we have gavel-kind, and also a latitude of election, both for senators and judges, almost equal to universal suffrage ; and this, too, in islands where we have no reason to believe that the Saxons ever intro duced any customs, or had any general authority. The effect of this kind of holding is to sub-divide the land with out limit, farther than what arises from the number of people that a given surface is capable of supporting; and,"], [349, "59 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. were this also unlimited, the proprietors of an estate might at length become so numerous that they would not have room to stand on its surface ; there are, however, many na tural causes which stop the sub-division long before it reaches such an extent as this. In the first place, no more people can live in a country than that country will feed ; and, though this may seem enough for most enquirers, there are a feAv others ; for, races which remain on the same ground, and \" breed in and in,\" as graziers term it, become first fatuous and unproductive, and then die out, no one knows very well how. The different talents, industry, and success of the different parties, even when these are mem bers of the same family, tend to make one prosper and another decline ; so that it is highly probable that natural causes arrest the influence of such a custom as that of gavel kind before it begins to have any very decidedly mischievous effects ; and, though free-trading in estates of land, as well as in every other sort of property, appears to be the natural and rational system ; yet gavel-kind is certainly not worse than its opposite, the law of entail. Still, there seems little doubt that the land in the Channel Islands is too much divided, both physically and in proprie torship. In such ground as has been long occupied, and this is the case with all that is worth occupying, the surface is so much broken by fences, hedge-rows, and roads, that it is literally cut into pieces ; and the fields, compared with those in most parts of England, are as small in proportion as the Islands are. This may produce some good effects, especially in lessening the violence of the storms, which would otherwise beat strongly over the surface, and reduce it to dry and unproductive moor, the same as we find in the few uninhabited spots ; but still, even this protection may be overdone, by being out of all proportion to that which is protected. The number of roads, in the island of Jersey especially, is immense, considering the limited extent of the surface, and there are several species of them, all recognized as distinct by the local authorities. In comparatively I"], [350, "60 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF modern times, military roads have been made, which greatly facilitate communication between one place and another; but these were constructed at the suggestion of the governor, and, in part at least, paid for with British money ; and thus they are king's highways by construction. Besides these, however, there are more ancient king's highways which used to be the carriage-roads. These are twelve feet broad, with two feet of bank on each side ; to these follow the eight feet ways, which also have two feet of bank on each side, and admit of one carriage ; and lastly, among the regular roads, anciently formed for the accommodation of the inhabitants generally, there are the four feet ways, which are of course only bridle roads. One or other of these descriptions of roads intersects the country in all directions, so that there is a public road to every cottage, and almost to every field. The charge of these country roads is committed to the local authorities ; and, in eArery vintaine or tything, there are men appointed to keep them in order. The narrow ones especi ally, and none of them are very wide, are very subject to be overshadowed by hedge-rows, which grow luxuriantly where ever there is shelter; and, though they make walking pleasant in the Summer, they very much increase the damp of Autumn, and the mire of Winter. In old times this used to be attended to Avith some ceremony. At Midsummer a perambulation used to be made by the high-sheriff riding in procession, accompanied by three or more of the jurats, in advance of whom the sheriff rode gallantly, with the end of his lance resting on the pommel of the saddle ; but, in latter times his staff was substituted. These were the visitors or judges ; and they were met on the borders of every parish by the constable, and twelve substantial men of the parish, walking on foot. The sheriff kept the middle of the road, and if the lance or staff touched the bough of a tree, the owner of that tree was fined, unless when the badness of the road made the official horse prefer one side to the other; and then the fine was levied on the OATerseers of the tything. In addition to these roads there were others, termed perqua-"], [351, "61 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. ges, which were 24 feet in width ; they extended from the churches to the sea, and were intended solely for the purpose of walking offenders safely out of the Island. In the times of ignorance and superstition, the churches afforded sanc tuary to those even who committed atrocious crimes ; and when a criminal took the sanctuary of the church, he was, by the law here, exempted from punishment, save banish ment from the island in one of whose churches he had taken refuge. Therefore, these roads were made to get the offender as speedily on the Avater as possible, as well as to protect him from the vengeance of those whom he had injured; because, to take vengeance upon any one who had taken church sanctuary was a grievous offence. Of course churches afford no more sanctuary in the Channel Islands now, than they do in the other parts of Britain ; and so the perquages are useless. \u2014 The limits to which we are restrict ed forbid our entering farther into general matters ; and therefore we must devote the remaining pages to some topo graphical and descriptive notice ofthe several Islands ; blend ing a few remarks on other subjects as we see cause. Before proceeding to do this, however, it may be right to notice one peculiarity of the Channel Islanders, which, though it arises out of the relation in which they stand to the British monarch, is yet so different from anything in Britain itself, that it seems worthy of being mentioned sepa rately. It will be recollected, that we have described those Islanders as standing in a different relation to their monarch than those of any of the nations around them, or indeed of any nation, the government of which has been modelled or much altered in modern times. They are still the vassals of a feudal lord, unconnected with any of the great institu tions of Britain, and the result is, that they take compara tively little interest in British politics, or in the general politics of the Avorld. Thus, their public opinion is just upon as small a scale as the land which they inhabit ; and a scuffle between two Islanders, is, in their estimation, a more i 2"], [352, "62 LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS. important event than a great battle between two of the most powerful states in the world. This may have its advantages, in so far as mere tranquillity is concerned ; but it tends greatly to repress their mental activity, and by necessary con sequence keeps them behind the rest of the world in all the sciences and arts ; and, notwithstanding the dense popula tion, and the commercial activity of the principal islands, the inhabitants have all along been very deficient in inventions and discoveries."], [353, "TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS. 63 CHAPTER IV. TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS. ISLAND OF JERSEY. Jersey, though the most distant from the British shores, is the largest, the richest, the most populous, and perhaps we may say the most accessible, of all the Channel Islands. Its form is nearly that of a parallelogram, having its greatest extent in the direction of east and west about 12 miles, and its extreme breadth about 7 miles. The shores are very irregu lar, and the surface is not estimated at more than 62| square miles, or 40,000 acres, which is equal to only a fraction of some single estates on the main-land of England. In 1831, the population was 36,582, being an increase of 60 per cent., during a period of 25 years ; so that the tendency of the population at this rate would be to double itself in little more than 31 years ; a rate of increase unparalleled perhaps, in any district, consisting of country and town, which had an abundant population at the time of the first census. It is also about ten years since this enumeration was made, so that if the increase has been the same during that interval, the population now, (1839) must be 45,362, say 45,000. This increase of population is almost unprecedented, except in single manufacturing towns under very extraordinary cir-"], [354, "64 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF cumstances ; and the ratio of the population to the surface is also higher than in any of the English counties, excepting Lancashire, and it is very nearly equal to that, if not greater. Middlesex and Surrey, from containing the population of London and its surrounding boroughs, are of course no fit subjects of comparison ; because London may be said to be the centre of the commerce, and of much of the wealth and political enterprise, of the world. Lancashire also has a larger share of export and import trade than any other pro vincial county of England, besides being the seat of one of the most extensive manufactures, and of many others, which, though thrown into the shade by the cotton manufacture, would be reckoned of first-rate character in almost any other part of the country. Yorkshire, the largest county in England, follows Lancashire as a manufacturing one, and is equal to it in the manufacturing districts, though not in the whole county ; but great part of it is thinly inhabited, and some of it is bleak moor, so that there are two acres and a half surface in it to each inhabitant. Hampshire, which is chiefly an agricultural county, has, exclusive of the absolute wastes, about one inhabitant to every three acres ; and it is not a little singular that a small spot like Jersey, containing as it does some waste land, and having much of the surface occupied by hedges and highways, should have more than one inhabitant to every single acre. There is no reason, hoAvever, to doubt the accuracy, either of the census, or of the estimated surface ; and thus it becomes an interesting enquiry to ascertain why Jersey has so great a population. It cannot be the fertility of the surface ; because, although the entire extent were under crop, according to the best system of husbandry for producing all the necessaries of life in fair proportion, Jersey could not supply food for its present inhabitants ; and then, there are many articles, such as coal, and everything formed of metal, which have to be brought from very long distances. As little is it the ex treme cheapness of living, which has drawn a vast popu lation toAvards it, at least, in so far as that living is the"], [355, "65 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS: produce of the island ; because, if the population of Jersey Avere solely confined to what groAvs there, provisions would be higher than in any part of England. The perfect freedom of trade ; the plentiful supply of provisions from the French markets, of good quality and moderate price; the abundance and cheapness of colonial produce; the fact of living among a people who are, and who have always been, their own governors in all local matters ; \u2014 and above all, the high and independent spirit, and the great industry and enterprise of the people themselves ; must be the chief causes of the extraordinary prosperity of this interesting Island. From the varied characters of the different parts of the Jersey shores, its appearance from sea is different, according to the direction in which it is approached. If approached from the north, it presents a succession of beetling precipices, with deep creeks, or inlets, between ; and, on the other sides, there are sandy bays, in which the tide ebbs far back at low-water, with jutting headlands, sometimes rising into rocky cliffs, together with numerous insulated rocks, off different parts of the island. The great difference between high and low-water, varying from 40 to 50 feet, also causes a very different aspect of all the shores, according to the time of tide at which the approach is made. If it is at high-water, and the surface smooth, then the cliffs of Jersey are reduced in the apparent elevation, many of the rocks, and all the sandy beaches are hidden, and itbears some resemblance to one of the peaceful isles in the middle of the tropical Pacific, which repose calmly and beautifully on the surface of an al most tideless ocean. If again, the approach is made at low water, especially the low-water of a spring-tide, when cir cumstances give that the maximum of its effect, Jersey rises up full 50 feet in all its lofty cliffs, and extends its shelving beaches. Differences in the state of the weather make much less variation in the sea around Jersey than they do around some of the other islands, more especially Alderney, where the bottom abounds more in rocks, and the currents set more against each other, and with greater A-iolence. The"], [356, "66 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF most beautiful approach, in respect of view of the tranquil sea, is to come round by the west of the island to St. Helier, at, or near, high-water. If this is done, the bays of St. Ouen in the west, St. Brelade in the south-west, and the smaller bay of Portelet, by diminishing in size, make a fine preparation for the bay of St. Aubin, as it opens upon get ting round Noirmont. This bay is of a pretty regularly curved form, about three miles across from point to point, and two miles inland, though at low-water, almost one mile in breadth of the sandy beach is left dry. Elizabeth castle, on its sea-girt rocks, stands about one mile westward of the most easterly point of the bay ; and is completely insulated at high-water, though one can walk to it dry-shod when the tide is out. Behind the castle lies the town of St. Helier, upon a finely diversified rising ground ; and it is a town of much bustle and activity, well-built in most parts, resorted to by a great deal of shipping, and altogether one of the most active, and thriving, and delightful, provincial towns in the British dominions. The land around the bay of St. Aubin rises gradually on all sides from the water, though not with a dull and uniform ascent, but finely diversified with little hills and vallies between, down which there flow numerous rills of fine water, imitating, on a miniature scale, the characteristic rivers of a continent, though none of these have a course of much more than four miles. Yet, they gather their rills from the high grounds, that rise from this bay in all direc tions, and reach the bold cliffs in the northern extremity, which, in some places, have a height of more than 250 feet, though, as already said, the appearance of that height varies with the tide. If we imagine a line drawn from Noirmont point northwards, along the summit-level, and then south wards and eastwards, until we again reach the heights near the shores, about two miles distant from St. Helier, we shall include one natural district ; and St. Aubin's bay may be said to be the receptacle of all the streams, by which this district is watered. Of these, there are five"], [357, "67 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. within the short extent of the three miles of beach from St. Helier to St. Aubin's ; and from this, one can easily infer that this portion of the island is well watered. Abundance of spring- water of very fine quality is indeed one of the cha racteristics of the island of Jersey ; and, where spring-water is not near at hand, the inhabitants can find excellent water by digging wells to a very moderate depth, as compared with what is requisite in the chalk strata. Diversity is the leading character of the surface of Jersey ; for it is, all over, one succession of elevations and valleys, which are of small size, but, on that account, more in har mony with the extent of the island. From the minute divi sion of the land there are a great many small hamlets and single houses distributed over the surface ; but many of these are so sheltered in dells, and embowered in trees, that one may traverse the surface again and again without being aware of their existence. Some of the manor houses of the wealthier inhabitants are neat and commodious ; and there are a very few which have some claim to the title of man sions, though fully as much for the length of time which they have remained in the hands of the same families, as for their own individual importance. There is, however, nothing in the island which can be considered as a park, or demesne ; and it is perhaps as well that there is not ; for, if there were any such, it would spoil the whole congruity of the place. This objection cannot be to any extent brought against the rapidly extending town of St. Helier, which is pushing its rows of villas along all the approaches ; for St. Helier is so proximate to the sea, and there is in general so much shipping in its harbour, as to give one the feeling that it is as much connected with, and dependent upon, the ex panse of the sea, as the narrowness of the land. The whole surface of Jersey is divided into twelve parishes ; and those parishes are divided into different num bers of vintaines, or tythings, which vary in number in the different parishes, but are never greater than six, nor less than two. These parishes regulate the number of members K"], [358, "68 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF sent to the convention of the estates, the rector making one and a layman, chosen by the people, another ; and these, with the twelve jurats, make thirty-six for the whole island. As is the case in most other places, these parishes do not follow the lines of natural boundary ; and they are all, to some extent, abutting on the sea : the parish of St. Saviour, which lies among the heights to the eastward having the least. Taking them in order, from near the south-east angle, westwards, the several parishes are, St. Clement's, extending from east to west about two miles and a half ; St. Saviour, approaching the coast in a narrow point near Fort Regent to the south-east ; St. Helier, stretching about two miles to ward the bottom of St. Aubin's bay ; St. Lawrence, for about half-a-mile to the westward of that ; and then St. Peter's, which extends from the shore of this bay to that of St. Ouen's bay on the west. The parish of St. Brelade, one of the most extensive, occupies all the surface of the peninsula on the south-west of the island, from a line extending westr ward from near the northern part of St. Aubin's bay. The town of St. Aubin's, the second in importance, is situated in this parish, at the mouth of a pleasant little stream, and on the shore of the bay to which it gives .name. After St. Bre lade and St. Peter, the parish of St. Ouen's occupies the north-western extremity of the island, abutting on a sandy bay on the south-west, but rising to lofty cliffs in the north. The last-named parish terminates a little to the eastward of a deep and picturesque inlet, Greve de Lecq, the extremity of which receives a pleasant little rivulet. Eastward of this is the parish of St. Mary, then St. John, Trinity, and St. Martin's, which last occupies the north-east corner of the island ; and the enumeration closes with Grou ville, occupy ing nearly half the eastern coast of the island ; having part of its shore Ioav, with some marshes inland, and a winding stream, which flows southward to near the church, and then north-eastwTard to the valley of Gorey, expanding into some miniature lakes, in both parts of the. loop. The topography of the inland surface is a matter of"], [359, "Im i VIJ \"I ll I' 1 1 ' \u25a0"], [360, ""], [361, ""], [362, "W E R . \u25a0 \u25a0"], [363, "69 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. minute observation, we had almost said of analysis ; for it is so varied, unlevel, and interrupted by trees, that the prospects are, generally speaking, exceedingly minute ; but there is one elevation, La Hogue Bie, from which a very ex tensive view of the island, and also of a great deal of the sea, may be obtained. This elevation is not above three miles inland from St. Helier, and the road is exceedingly beauti ful, many fine villas, and among the rest the government house, standing on the sides of it. Upon this height there is an artificial mount of some dimensions, but, having no re semblance to a barrow ; and upon its summit there is a structure termed the Prince's tower. Shrubs flower richly in the island ; and this mount, being a sort of pleasure-ground to which many resort, is planted with great taste, and at some seasons very beautiful. An old tower and mound of earth, especially if they have no known history, are nothing with out a legend ; and accordingly one has been contrived for this, and inserted in the black book of Coutance: one of those curious jumbles of a little truth with much falsehood, which monastic establishments manufactured and preserved in all parts of the world. A legend is nothing, unless it contains \" a something \" supernatural, ghostly or bodily ; and if bodily, it must not be in the likeness of anything upon the earth, or the waters under the earth. A dragon, never having been seen by the eyes of mortal man, except in the character of a little innocent reptile, as guiltless of the powers and ravages of the dragons renowned in story as can well be imagined, is one of the most appropriate sub jects for this purpose. Therefore, according to the legend, there was, in times long gone by, but still posterior to the beginning of the 10th century, a most formidable dragon in habiting and infesting this part of Jersey, which ate up man and beast without distinction, if they dared to appear in the limits of its territory. The rumour of this dragon excited the courageous stomach of a certain Norman noble, De Hambie, to the pitch of Hercules when he went forth to grapple with the Hydra \u2014 or even that of the more redoubted k 2"], [364, "70 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF \" John of Arnha',\" when he joined issue with, and vanquished the water Kelpie, upon the strand at the estuary of the North Esk, near Montrose in Scotland ; which, if it happened at all, certainly took place in the nineteenth century. Thus roused to deeds of glory, and emulating the noblest examples of ancient and modern times \u2014 that is to say, that if he had lived in modern times, he would have emulated the latter \u2014 the doughty Norman begirt himself Avith the tools of destruc tion, and boldly marched single-handed to defy the dragon in his den. He made short work of settling the enormities of the unearthly monster ; but fell a sacrifice, either to the pestilent breath which the dragon brought from another quarter, or to the treachery of his squire, derived haply from a similar origin ; and the said squire returning to Normandy, espoused the mourning widow of the gallant man ; but the conscience of the squire told tales in his sleep, in consequence of which he received the reward of his deed, whether he did that deed or not ; and the repentant widow cast together the mount, and erected the tower, in order that the strength and purity of her conjugal affection might be held in perpetual memorial. Thus much for the legend ; and, true or false, if it shall entice one visitor to the spot, he will be amply re warded by that beauty of nature, which is the best antidote to the follies of absurd legendary lore. The view from this monument of the dragon and the hero is certainly one of the finest in the island ; because, when there, one overlooks the whole of it, until the horizon is margined by the sea, in almost every direction ; with the exception perhaps of a few points to the northward. One can see how swelling hill and deepening ravine alternate with each other ; and can choose one's way to the shore in whatever direction may be the most inviting at the time. There are, however, other views from heights in the south, the east, and the north, which are abundantly pleasant ; but none so extensive as this. When, however, one descends for even a very short distance in almost any direction, the extensive prospect is gone, and one must be contented with"], [365, "71 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. such bits as can be seen ; the number and variety of which, however, make much amends for the limited extent of each individually. In threading one's way to the coast by any of the dells \u2014 and for this the narrow and bower-enwoven paths are to be preferred on a summer day \u2014 one has an opportunity of ex amining more of the old and peculiar character of the island, than can be seen in the town of St. Helier, or any of the coast villages, characteristic as most of these are. The effect of the law or custom of gavel-kind is apparent, not only in the small dimensions of the hedge-encompassed fields, but in those which are so small as not to admit of further division by any kind of fence, without an actual waste and destruction of the surface, and an absolute suffocation of every plant attempted to be grown upon it : these little fields often present the same variety of crops, in grain, in cultivated grasses, and in green feed plants, and in roots for the use of man or of domesticated animals, which, in some parts of the main-land of Britain, are to be met with upon the whole of a farm equal in area to the largest parish in the island. In Jersey, every farm-house has its flower-garden; every cottage with a spot of ground the same ; and flowering shrubs in the utmost luxuriance of leaf and beauty of blossom, are everywhere to be met with. Nor can one fail to notice the apple-orchards that are to supply the family with their luscious and cooling cyder, which is abundant in quantity, and choice in quality ; and whether these more peculiarly home-plantations are in blossom or in fruit, they are equally beautiful, and speak of the frugality of the rustics, as well as of their industry. But to one who wishes to enjoy all the beauties \u2014 they seldom rise to sublimities, how lofty soever the cliffs may be \u2014 of the island of Jersey, must not content himself with as cending the heights and rambling downward through the glades and groves, \u2014 he must take it along the line of the shores, and trace the phenomena of the land and water where they meet each other. There is no very deep bay or"], [366, "72 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF creek which penetrates into this island, that is to say, none penetrates through to a very great extent ; and none of the small streams has any opening to the sea, which can be call ed ah estuary ; but, notwithstanding this, the shores are much varied, and very beautiful in their variations ; and they have this advantage, that, with a little skilful manage ment, a visitor, desirous of examining for himself the rela tions of sea and land at the point of their junction, can, at some state or other of the tide, circumambulate the island, with the exception of a very few of the most projecting points ; and, as there are foot-paths across these, this change is a relief rather than an annoyance. All sides of the island abound in bays, some of larger dimensions, and some of smaller ; and where the land comes down pretty low to its junction with the water, between projecting headlands, there is invariably a wide extent of firm sandy beach, across which, a pedestrian may make his way with ease and com fort, only with due care that the tide does not advance too rapidly upon him before he gains the point that he desires to reach. Here, however, though a little caution is neces sary, as at is indeed upon all tidal beaches, there is no par ticularly imminent danger ; for, though the tides rise high and sink low upon the shores of Jersey, they do so very uniformly ; and there is no \" bore,\" or formidable wave of the first inset of tide, such as we find upon coasts where the rise and fall is less, but where the confluence of tides pro duces a ridge in the ocean waters that set shoreward with velocity, even in tranquil states of the weather. Upon the whole, therefore, a pedestrian tour round the shores of Jer sey, though a little tedious, is an exceedingly pleasant one, and involves not a single jot of danger. The bays, on the south, the west, and the south-east, are a little tame at low water, because the shores are flat, and the tide ebbs out to a great distance. The chief exception to this is the bay of St. Brelade, the termination of which is rather more than a mile directly west of St. Aubin's, and near the parish church from which it takes its name. Toward the upper part of"], [367, ""], [368, "S1 BRELADE'S CHURCH Jersey. ST SAVIOURS CHURCH. Jersey.

This, however, takes nothing from their beauty ; and their quiet situation, together with a southern sun, exhaling their fragrance, and the fresh air, at the same time, stealing gently up from the sea to replace that which the heat elevates, render the place exceedingly delightful. This is not diminished by the amphitheatre of heights which swell around, clothed with verdure, and en riched by little groves ; and the small parish church of St. Brelade, standing near the water-edge, which is said to be the oldest in the island, and which is in the most simple and primitive style, without tower, or spire, or other ornament, gives a finish to the scene, and makes one fancy one's self in a land of the most primeval innocence. Though upon a smaller scale, this bay far exceeds in simple beauty the bay of St. Aubin's, with its town, its towers, and its other insig nia of the bustle and warfare of human beings ; for, though this is at so small a distance, yet passing from the one to the other is like a transition from the turmoil of the busy world to the repose and peace of an Eden. After the beauties of St. Brelade's bay, the dull uniformity of the larger, but much tamer bay of St. Ouen's, which oc cupies great part of the west of the island, can hardly bear to be visited, excepting for the sake of contrast ; and it is in the vicinity of this last-named bay that we meet with any thing like a desert in Jersey, from the strong south-west winds having drifted the sands over some portion of the surface, and the sea air bloAving and beating so keenly that trees will not grow. When, however, we turn to the opposite extremity of the island, we find some of the sweet est bays that can be imagined."], [370, "74 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF Rozel bay, in the extreme north-east, is one of the most beautiful of these. It is, indeed, rather a creek than a bay, because the water is narrow ; but it is turned away from the violent action of the gales ; and, therefore, vegetation of all kinds is much more luxuriant upon its steep and craggy margins, than anywhere on the western and south-western parts, with the exception of the upper part of Brelade's bay, which is protected by the projecting land to the west ward. Brelade bay is, however, one of the tidal disclosures of the beach, from the inland part of which the tide ebbs back nearly half-a-mile, while there is no beach in this one, but only an elevation and depression of the water upon the bold and cliffy shores. Rozel bay is much resorted to by parties of the lovers of natural beauty ; and they shew their good taste by so resorting. A little to the westward of this picturesque little bay, and still in the north-east part of the island, there is situated Boulay bay, an inbend of the cliffs, rather more than a mile in width, from point to point, and stretching about half-a-mile inland. This bay is faced to landward by bold and precipitous rocks. It has the advan tage of all other bays in the island, in having a considerable depth of water, even at the ebb of spring-tides ; and, as it is turned away from the most violent winds, perhaps it is the most safe and acceptable harbour in the whole island. The character of the adjoining land, however, renders it valuable in a maritime point of view only, and not with any refe rence to mercantile purposes ; but it is highly probable that, if future hostilities should render the rendezvous of a British squadron necessary in those seas, this bay will be highly eligible to them ; as, if the wind were favorable, it could be reached or departed from in all states of the tide ; and the lofty cliffs that surround it command a very extensive view of whatever naval armaments might be abroad in the Channel. Adjacent to this bay, there are many minor creeks of small dimensions, but of no inconsiderable beauty, the visit ing of which is calculated amply to repay the labour of those"], [371, "Ul I I il _B_W . iw.ix/, ar ii /: ,1 >* Widusbr SiMr/inl foe //,, Jh,pn,l,,i ./_\u2022: \u25a0 l,'\u201el,/\u201e\u201e \u201e titlweSfrecl JtyJJPilili\u201e\u201e<i,h,llt, LiArnei .JRgh S/reel"], [372, ""], [373, ""], [374, "JE H S"], [375, "75 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. who are fond of rocky shores ; but the only one which we shall notice is \" La Greve de Lacq,\" about five miles to the westward. This is a small expanse of water, which pene trates deeply into the land, but which has many of the cha racters of a dock for the reception of shipping. The cliffs around it are lofty ; they approach within a short distance of each other ; and the water in the greater part has consi derable depth even at the lowest ebbs. It also resembles the creeks and bays farther to the east, in being turned from the more violent action of the elements ; and therefore, indepen dently of its natural beauties, it is one of the most interest. ing little in-bends along the whole shores of the island ; and it is one, which, if need were, might, like the one just previously mentioned, be turned to considerable account in the accommodation of vessels whose only object Avere to range these seas, and protect other navigators from injury. St. Catherine's and Granville bays in the eastern part of the island, though both of that character from which the tide ebbs back to a considerable distance, are yet interesting features of the coast ; though the chief interest of the former, as a sight, is Mont Orgueil castle, once a place of no small importance ; and the most striking circumstance connected with the latter is its oyster fishery. There is, indeed, no part of the coast of this island which is without interest ; and, when other interest might seem to be wanting, the contrast of one part with another supplies it. The cliffs, and caves, and rifted rocks of the northern shore, tire after one has exa mined them in all their extent, which may be about nine miles, from Verchet point on the east, to Primade on the Avest ; so that after them, the alternations of tide-beach bays and head lands on the other coasts form a pleasing variety. TOWNS AND PLACES OF IMPORTANCE. St. Helier's is beyond all comparison the most important town, not only in Jersey, but in the Channel Islands. Its situation is exceedingly beautiful ; and it is equally well adapted for commercial purposes, and agreeable residence. L"], [376, "76 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF It is true, that, from the distance to which the water ebbs back, the harbour of this town is only a tidal one ; but then, the height to which the tide rises, renders it one of the most valuable harbours of this description. Vessels of about 200 tons burden can be afloat close to the pier at high-water of the lowest neap-tides ; while, during high spring-tides, those Avhich have much more draught of water may arrive and depart with perfect safety. The tonnage of vessels belonging to this port is very great ; but, from the extent of ship-building, no statement, either of the amount or the tonnage, would remain anything like correct, even during the short time between the writing of the statement and its publication. Perhaps, 300 vessels of 30,000 tons, together with about 500 large boats, may be a tolerably near approximation to the present marine craft of Jersey ; and this is for the greater part of the year in active operation. Many vessels are built at St. Helier's ; and for this, the town possesses several ad- vantages. Timber, especially Baltic timber, and all the other materiel requisite in ship-building, may be obtained here much cheaper than in Britain, where the hand of the custom-house is heavily laid upon it. These advantages are of course not hidden ; and the consequence is, that the con- struction of ships has been practised to such an extent, that the builders have acquired the requisite skill and experience; so that vessels built here are good as well as cheap. The trade from the port is very varied ; and several departments of it are exceedingly lucrative, and might perhaps be render- ed more so. Except the imposts in the island itself the trade is free ; and the produce of Jersey, or any other of the Islands, is admitted into the markets of England without paying the usual duty on foreign produce. In consequence of this, though the island of Jersey does not, and cannot possibly, produce nearly enough grain for the support of its own numerous population ; yet, when the duty on foreign corn is high, the Channel Islands might export largely to Britain without paying the duty. That they might supply themselves from other quarters, and send to the British mar-"], [377, "77 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. ket the whole that is grown upon their own land, is perfectly according to law, and so might be done openly and avowedly. Not only this ; for neither the parliament nor the executive of England have any right to take cognizance, either of what grows in the Channel Islands, or the quantity ; and, there fore, if there were such a disparity of price, of equally valu able corn, in the markets of northern Europe and that of England as is sometimes alleged, a very large foreign sup ply might, and would, find its way to Britain by this means. That such is not actually the case, at least to the supposed extent, is proved by the fact, that the export of corn from the Islands to Britain is not very considerable. There is, however, some exportation this way ; and as it is demonstra ble that the Islands do not produce nearly as much as they require, there must be an advantage in the species of trade now mentioned. We may remark, that the returns represent the produce of wheat in Jersey as being very great in pro portion to the breadth of land under crop \u2014 not less than about 40 bushels to an acre ; but then there is a question as to the value of this quantity. From the comparatively short time that it requires to occupy the ground, bearded wheat is pretty common ; and the husk of this is thick, and the grain poor, as compared to the beardless wheat commonly grown in England. When the fields under wheat are of any consi derable breadth, which, however, must be rare where estates do not average above 15 acres, and frequently not the fourth of that extent, the crop is stated, by the people themselves, to be much greater than that which we have noticed, or to reach between 60 and 70 bushels per acre. This, however, is only upon some peculiar spots ; peculiar, not merely in the native fertility of the soil, but in the extent of surface which admits something like scientific farming to be carried on ; which is quite impracticable upon the small patches into which the greater part of the surface is divided. It appears also, that the merchants and ship-owners of St. Helier's, find it more advantageous to send the foreign grain which they import over and above their own supply to other markets ; l 2"], [378, "78 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF but even then the quantity stated so exported does not ac count for the whole of the import. This import often amounts to at least two quarters of wheat annually for each individual of the population; and, as this is more than double the average supply of England, which is probably more exclusively a wheat consuming country than the Islands, there must be a large surplus to dispose of in some way ; and there is no doubt that part of this is consumed in the victualling of vessels. Oats and barley, the latter especially, are largely imported into Jersey ; and it does not appear that any is again exported. Of various kinds of its domestic produce, the export from the island is very considerable. Potatoes,' for which both soil and climate are well adapted, are exported, not only to Britain, but to southern Europe, and as far as South Ameri ca. Onions also form an item of some extent; but the greater part of them are from the continent. Apples and cider are more extensive articles ; and both of these are the bona fide produce of the island ; and the export of them, especially of cider, is rapidly on the increase. Butter is an article of extensive export, of which, some is the produce of the island, and some probably not. Sometimes nearly a hundred thousand pounds are sent to England fresh, in the course of the year, for immediate consumption ; and, perhaps, more than three times this quantity of salted butter ; but two-thirds of this last appear to be obtained from the conti nent. There are various other articles of export to Britain, which purport to be the growth of the island, but what we have enumerated are among the chief; and, though this de scription of trade forms but a small fraction of the whole trade of which St. Helier's is the centre, it furnishes some notion of the general extent ; for be it remembered, that the greater part of the articles enumerated are not exports from necessity, like the exports of provisions from some other countries, which want compels to send abroad what they ought to consume at home, but commercial exports, and very many of them of goods previously imported."], [379, "79 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS, , The free-trade, combined with the peculiar situation of Jersey, gives St. Helier's very great advantages in the mar kets, both of continental Europe and of America ; because, whatever raw materiel can be obtained upon the continent loAver than in the English market, \u2014 and this must be the case with every commodity upon which an import duty is imposed \u2014 may be brought to Jersey, manufactured there, and then exported to the British colonies, or elsewhere, as British manufacture ; and, though the British exporter may be allowed a drawback upon what he exports, equal to the greater part of the import duty, yet, he is in a worse situa tion than the exporter from St. Helier's ; this will appear perfectly evident, when it is considered that the paying of a duty in the first instance, especially upon the materials of any manufacture, cramps the trade, and lays ,a burden upon the whole manufacturing process, from which the drawback on the portion exported is scarcely any relief, inasmuch as a small part of it only, if indeed any part at all, reaches those upon whom the burden presses most severely. This applies to many articles of manufacture ; but we may instance that of leather, which the Jersey people can have, not only ready dressed, but actually ready worked up, from France, or any other part of the continent where it is cheap ; and this they may export manufactured, just as if it Avere entirely a home product. The consequence is, that they export a vast num ber of boots, shoes, and other leather manufactured articles, especially to the British colonies ; and this, together with clothing, and all the various necessaries which the colonists require, opens up for the Jersey traders a circular trade, which pays at every stage of the circuit. They, for in stance, carry a cargo to the fish colonies, and there re load with fish. This fish they may carry, either to the warmer parts of America, or to the south of Europe. If to the former, the return cargo is colonial produce, which they can carry directly to the Baltic, or to other parts of northern Europe, and fetch grain, hemp, flax, timber, tallow, and all the articles which are most valuable in a place where there"], [380, "80 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF is much resort of shipping. If they proceed to southern Europe, then the fruits, the wines, and the other produce of these countries, are brought in return, as a store, both for home consumption, and for general sale, chiefly abroad, or in the colonies ; but in part also in Britain. In all these, and in many others that could be mentioned, they have peculiar advantages in their domestic regulations ; and the consequence is, that trade 'of all kinds flourishes exceed ingly ; and the Channel Islands generally, and St. Helier's in particular, make great advances in population and wealth. The annual trade in wines and spirits is very great ; and it extends, not only to Europe and America, but to some parts of Africa ; while the very low price of what remains on their hands is one of the inducements that strangers have to settle there ; and the same applies to every article of foreign pro duce, colonial or otherwise, that pays an import duty upon being admitted into the English market. Indeed, it is only such articles as may be sent free to England Avhich are as high-priced in the Islands as there ; and thus, the remark able difference in the prices of these commodities operates as a bounty upon foreign trade to the people of the Islands, and induces the ships of St. Helier's to visit most parts of the commercial world. We mentioned the situation of the island as being advan tageous ; and that it is so, much more than almost any part in Britain, may be seen by simple inspection of the map. To all vessels, except coasters, the English shore of the Channel is the dangerous one ; because it is the lee-shore, or the one against which the general current of the wind beats, and toward which the high-water sets right in in many places. Leaving Jersey, sea-room may always be taken, whether the voyage is up Channel or down Channel ; and, therefore, a Jersey vessel may be at the south of Eu rope, or half-way across the Atlantic, while a vessel from London, for the same destination, is held wind-bound in the Downs. Up Channel the advantage is not quite so great, because down Channel is the tedious passage for an English"], [381, "THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. 81 vessel ; but still, upon this voyage, especially for the Nether lands, Hamburgh, or the Baltic, the St. Helier's vessel bas the advantage. These circumstances, both in regulation and natural posi tion, are all of a nature susceptible of much improvement ; and, therefore, the increase of population, and all its concomi tants, which are at present so striking in this island and its capital, are not of that mushroom kind which depends upon the caprice of fashion or anything else ; but substantially and naturally involved in the physical and municipal state of the place ; and the channels of trade already opened, or opening, show that there is little to be apprehended from the failure of any one trade. Amid the uncertainties of the commer cial world, it has been found by experience, that places which depend almost solely upon any one single branch of trade or manufacture, unless physical circumstances are unconquerably strong in their favour, have their fluctua tions, and we may add, their waxings and wanings \u2014 their rise and their fall, not so speedily, perhaps, but in the end as certainly, as those mushroom places of resort, Avhich fashion raises up or casts down, according to the caprice of her vota ries. We have left scarcely any room for a topographical description of St. Helier's ; and this is, perhaps, the less to be regretted, in as much as, like the whole of the Islands, it had much better be seen than described. The town, taking all its purlieus, is of large extent, and there are in it, or immediately connected with it, certainly more than 20,000 inhabitants ; and, it is to be observed of those inhabL tants, that they do not consist of mere drudges, confined by the thousand to some single branch of a great manufacture, every day, and all day long ; on the contrary, the great ma jority of them have some aim or purpose of their own to work out ; and this, after all, is the grand stimulus which arouses the activity and enterprise of mankind to the fullest and most profitable extent. The town is not gaudy ; but it is well-built, and clean,"], [382, "82 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF and neat ; and every article, either of necessity or luxury, is good and abundant. To the mere looker-on, who has come from England to look, there is a peculiarity in the street display, more especially in the French peasantry, and also in many of the natives, who resort to this, their best market, with provisions. These little peculiarities, hoAvever, are soon got the better of ; and, it may be remarked, that, in propor tion as the varied society and the abundance of any place is adapted the more for being the home of all the world, all the world is sooner at home in it. A town of even the size of St. Helier's cannot be expected to be like London in this respect ; for London is a home which welcomes willing and well-minded men, come from what quarter they may ; but, comparing the Channel Islands with Britain, and St. Helier's with London, there is a relative proportion, in consequence of which, St. Helier's may be said to belong to the same class of towns as the British metropolis. The royal square of St. Helier's is, as it were, the centre of the town ; the principal shops are around it, together with the public offices, and it is the favourite place of resort for street conversation in the pauses of time among the busy ; and habitually, in the mornings, for those who have little else to do. There is a thriving air about all the shops and establishments ; and, we need not add that, as the town is the grand mart for the whole natives of the island, and for great numbers of strangers, brought hither connected with the shipping, or otherwise, a great deal of what may be called domestic trade, or trade for family supply, is carried on. The public buildings have not many attractions ; the church is among the best, but it is substantial rather than elegant, and none of the other buildings have much architec tural display. This, indeed, holds true of the whole island : the churches are everywhere small and homely structures, and the dAvellings appear to be built for comfort rather than display. The humble appearance of the churches is easily accounted for, by the fact that all the wealth of the great church-building age went to the Norman abbots, and much"], [383, "_8 \u00a9\u00a5*_\u2022_ i. \u25a0 M8__ , ST il \"-'\u25a0'\u25a0 1 1: /; i / i . .,',.

As for display of dwelling-houses, again, especially such as are beyond the immediate environs of the town, there is no scope for display ; for they are so huddled up among trees, that it is not easy to get a sight of them. The most striking erections in the vicinity of the town are the fortifications ; and they stand in places so conspicu ous, that they would make striking objects in any landscape. Elizabeth castle, in the mouth of the bay, is the oldest, and the most pictorial. It stands, as already mentioned, on a rock, or rather on a ledge of rocks, where the Augustine monastery of St. Helier once stood. At high-water it is about three-quarters of a mile from the point of the pier at St. Helier's ; but, at low-water, a causeway about a mile long, is dry. This castle is a beautiful object ; and, when circumstances unfortunately require it, it forms a good de fence to the town and harbour. It was first projected in the reign of Edward VI, built in that of Elizabeth, in 1586, and has since received various alterations. There is a tradition current, that, when this castle was first projected, all the bells and other valuables of the churches were sent to France for sale, in order to defray part of the expence ; but that the vessel was sunk by the wind of heaven, as a due infliction for making merchandise of these holy things. This story \u2014 to which there are some parallels on the British shore \u2014 admits of a more rational explanation upon very diffe rent grounds. When Henry VIII confiscated the lands and rents of the Norman abbots in this island, these gentry con trived to filch away the church bells and other valuables, before Henry's commissioners could get possession ; and then they invented this story against Edward, in order to make him, and through him the reformed religion, odious in the sight of the Jersey people. A more modern fort frowns defiance against invaders upon a rising ground immediately to the south of St. Helier's. This fort is well constructed ; but, AI"], [388, "84 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF from its size, the proper defence of it would require a nume rous garrison ; and though strong toward the sea, it is much less so on the land side ; there being heights there, within cannon-shot, which so completely command it, as that it could not hold out for any great length of time, unless at a great sacrifice. It, hoAvever, makes a splendid show of de fence ; and it is, at all events, desirable that nothing else than this should ever again be wanted. Mont Orgueil or Gouray castle, about the middle of the east side of the island, between the bay. of St. Catherine on the north, and Grouville bay on the south, is a far more ancient structure than either of those adjoining St. Helier's. It is called Gouray from the adjoining village, which, after St. Helier's, is the most populous in the island, and the principal residence of the oyster fishermen, who, with their families, are said to amount to more than 4000, and have upwards of 250 boats employed in the fishery. \u2014 The chief mart for the oysters being the supply of the fattening beds for these mollusca in the estuary of the Thames. In later times the castle obtained its present name from the command ing eminence on which it was erected. The first founder of this castle is not accurately known, but tradition says it was built by Duke Robert, the eldest, and unfortunate son of the Conqueror; and it certainly was in existence as a place of strength in the reign of King John. After many unsuccessful attempts, the chamberlain of France got pos session of it in the reign of Henry VI ; but it was re-taken in the reign of Edward IV, and received some repairs in that of Elizabeth. In the measures which led to the civil wars ; it was, for three years, the dungeon in which Prynne was confined ; and he celebrated it in that peculiar kind of doggrel verse which was characteristic of his times, and of his party. This castle, however, being somewhat dilapidated during the siege and capture by Haines the republican general, was allowed to fall into decay after Elizabeth castle was built and became the residence of the governor, so that now it is only a ruin ; and almost the only military"], [389, "JERSEY Winch, ..in Publuhsd for the Proprietor, Ja* Bobbins , follaje Street By D.E Gitmour, Public library, lii.ih Street"], [390, ""], [391, "85 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. duty performed in it, is the hoisting of a holiday flag. There are a few guns upon it ; but these are honey-combed, and useless ; and the castle itself bears very strong marks of the gashes of time. Ivy, and other plants fond of ruins, are, however, throwing the mantle of nature around it ; and, even now, this castle, the summit of which commands a very delightful view, is a far more pleasing object than it could have been in the days of its military strength. There is nothing particularly interesting in the village of Gouray ; and the coast to the south is dull and monotonous, and in some places marshy and unwholesome. Two little forts, and five or six martello towers, stand sentry upon this repulsive part of the coast ; but fortunately they are now no thing better than monuments. The only other place in the island which we can notice, is the town or village of St. Aubin, which lies directly opposite St. Helier's. This was once the largest town in the island, and the place is still pleasant, though its situation is much less central than that of the present capital. It may be reached from St Helier's, across the sands at low-water, or round the bay when the tide is in ; the latter road being perhaps a mile longer than the former. The situation of the town is very pleasant; but, since its rival became so important, it is only the rem nant of what it once was. Still, however, it is in decent widowhood ; and some of the ancient families of Jersey prefer its neighbourhood to that of St. Helier's. There is a harbour; but it has no trade, and can hardly be said to admit of being made a good landing place ; but the best anchorage for vessels of burden is in the offing ; and, upon a rock in advance of the harbour, there is a fort for the defence of what remains of the town \u2014 if such defence shall ever be needed. \u2014 So much for Jersey; and we regret our space will not admit of adding more. THE ISLAND OF GUERNSEY Guernsey, which ranks next to Jersey in importance, claims our next attention. This island, together with Alder- m 2"], [392, "86 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF ney, Cerq, Herm, and Jethou, forms the second bailiwick of the Channel Islands. It contains by far the greater part of the populations of the bailiwick ; but all the islands toge ther, fall short of Jersey in population. The usual estimate is, that Guernsey is 26 miles from the coast of France, 15 from Alderney, and 6 from Cerq. It is nearly triangular in form ; and the area is about 32,000 acres, being to Jersey, in the ratio of 4 to 5. It is rather less populous, the ratio being less than 7 to 9 ; and, as its capital has not so much trade, perhaps the population has not increased so much of late years. The population in 1831, was 24,349. The south coast of Guernsey is high and rocky, without anything that can be considered a harbour, or landing place ; bays are very numerous on the north-west, but they are ex posed, and their entrances are much interrupted by rocks ; while, in many of them, the tide ebbs back a considerable way. The general slope of the land in Guernsey is toward the north, with the exception of a portion which slopes east ward toward the bay upon which St. Peter's Port, the only town in the island, is situated. The presence of wind-mills upon many of the heights of Guernsey, show that it is not quite so well supplied with streams, as Jersey ; but still it is a fine island, and in a state of progressive improvement. As many of the observations made respecting Jersey apply proportionally to the other islands, it will be unnecessary to repeat them. With regard to the holding of lands, the tenure is the same ; and there is scarcely an estate in the island which exceeds 12 acres.\" Still the people do not sow so many different crops in the same little field as in Jersey, neither are the crops equally quite so abundant. One pecu liar custom is, to pull the corn up by the roots, as is usually done with flax; but, in doing this, when they are fully ripened, they are likely to lose more at one end than they gain at another. The country people complain that small birds, especially sparrows, are most destructive to the crops ; and, that the states have of late, granted ,\u00a370 a year to carry on the war against the sparrows \u2014 probably without"], [393, "<,\" S SlupluTd del HQ'SM STRI -. . >E , E R 5 P@lftT.

The soil of Guernsey is generally de composed gneiss, with very little strong land in any quarter. Some lands, lately brought into grass by drainage, afford excellent pasture, as well as meadow hay ; and by these means the breed of cattle has been improved, and the num bers augmented. The soil is remarkably well suited for the growth of roots, whether bulbous or tuberous. Of this, the naturalization of the beautiful Guernsey lily samarlyllis sar senensisj is a proof. That plant is understood to be a native of Japan ; and, yet it grows as luxuriantly, and flowers as freely, and that with comparatively little attention, in Guernsey, as if that were its native soil. But no very satis factory conclusion can be drawn from a Japanese plant ; for many of the natives of that singularly varied country thrive well in almost every variety of climate, from the extreme of polar heat to a very high latitude or elevation. Still, how ever, the successful growth of more practically useful plants than the Guernsey lily, shows how well the soil is adapted for most plants. The parsnip was of old the staple root of this and the other Islands; but, though it is extensively grown, it is now rivaled by the mangel wortzel and the potato, \u2014 the former of these two being cheaply cultivated, and growing most luxuriantly. One might infer this indeed from the friable nature of the decomposed granite. The cows of Guernsey are much esteemed, for the quality, if not the quantity, of their milk ; and they are easily fed. Though they are of the same breed as the other island cows, which are so much prized in England, under the name of the Alder ney breed, they are not exported in very great numbers from Guernsey. The quantity of cider and apples, and in deed of most articles of island produce, is much smaller, in proportion to the size and population, than from Jersey; but, of late years, there has been an addition to it in spirits distilled from potatoes. This is no uncommon distillation"], [396, "88 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF in many parts of Europe ; and it is said to be illegally prac tised in Britain ; but the spirit is of very inferior quality, and by no means wholesome, unless it is carefully rectified ; for there is a narcotic poison in the skin of the potato, or its internal surface, which, though it is evaporated, or dis solved, in all the ordinary modes of cooking, rises along with the alcohol upon distillation. Sienite, usually termed Guernsey granite, is shipped in considerable quantities, chiefly for the London market, but also for other places. It is sent out of the island in two states \u2014 as blocks for strong purposes in building, and broken into chips for paving. Though not so extensively, Guernsey partakes of the same trade as Jersey ; though the foreign branch of it does not pass so directly through the islaud as the other. Still, as the soil of Guernsey does not perhaps yield so large a fraction of what the inhabitants require as the soil of Jersey, some means must be had recourse to, in order to make up the difference. This is principally the manufacture of woollen into coarse fabrics, especially such as are adapted for sailors' clothing ; and these articles \u2014 many of them knitted \u2014 are to be found in the sea-ports of most parts of the world. The returns for these articles are generally, wheat, barley, and oats, chiefly the two latter kinds of grain ; for, according to the returns, the quantity raised in the Islands, is not equal to above a fourth of the supply ; while in Jersey it is greater, though probably not one half, as has sometimes been stated. There may be another difference, however ; the people dispersed over the surface of Guernsey probably subsist a good deal more upon roots, and other vegetables, which do not come under the denomination of grain. There is of course no coal in Guernsey, save what is imported; and, as the island is less wooded, the people are at least as dependent on sea-weed for the important article of fuel. Some parts of the island are, however, still covered with furze, and this affords a small supply to such as are near the places where it grows."], [397, "89 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. The southern part of the island, imagining it to be divided on a line drawn from the middle of the east side westward, is entirely composed of gneiss ; but, northward of this, the gneiss is in great part disintegrated and removed ; though large masses of stone, and heaps of fragments, abound in many places, over the more low-lying and indurated rock. In this northern part, a tract of about 300 acres has of late been recovered : it used to be left dry for a considerable part of the tide ; and the embanking and draining have turned it into an excellent meadow. In short, the people of this is land make the most of their soil \u2014 and so they may ; for they have very little of it, and must pay high if they hold it or not. There are some' slight differences between the con stitution, of the states at least, in Guernsey, and in Jersey ; and it is to this difference only, that we need pay attention. The rectors are a sort of lords spiritual, and the constables honourable commoners, the same as in Jersey ; but the jurats, or lords temporal, are differently elected, being chosen, not by the body of the people, but by the states of election. These states of election consist of two constables for each parish, and a certain fixed number of other members, who are elected by the rate-payers ; and these together, elect the jurats. The baillie is named by the crown, or by the gover nor ; and the rectors of the parish are appointed by the same authority ; so that the only difference after all consists in a more extended number of representatives, and a second choosing by them of the judicial part of the number, after they themselves are chosen. In practical effect, we believe, this constitution does not appear to be very different, or at all events very much worse than that of the sister island. It is described as working more quietly, and producing much less party spirit and electioneering scramble than there is in Jersey ; and, if quietude were the summum bonum of a government, and bustle and scramble the alternate evil, then the comparative absence of party spirit and party struggle in Guernsey would show that it is the better go verned island. But, just as in individual men there is a mania"], [398, "90 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF which is wild and infuriated, and fatuity which is almost to tally silent and passive, and as both of these are grievous diseases, and render the party afflicted with either of them quite unfit for use in the world, \u2014 even so there may be a passive indifference in political matters, by means of which, men shall not only lose their rights, but gradually sink down in character and energy, till they are not only unwor thy, but incapable of possessing any ; and we may add, that just as in the case of the diseases, frenzy may be cured, but fatuity, never. One reason of the inferiority of Guernsey to Jersey, in point of trade, while none of its natural advantages appear to be greater, may have been the closer illicit intercourse which subsisted between it and the south of England, which continued till the establishment of the present coast-guard, occupying the attention and impairing the morals, of some at least, of the population of Guernsey, while those of Jersey were laying the foundation of a more extensive and varied, and therefore a more lucrative and stable trade. But, however injurious the effects of this contraband inter course between Guernsey and the south of England may have been, it was not unnatural ; for it has been found in all countries that, when a duty has been unreasonably high, people have looked upon the evasion of it as no moral crime, for whatever purpose it may have been imposed ; and we have heard of a collector of customs making a fortune by smuggling, as well as of a British distiller, who never had any spirits on his own table, save that smuggled from abroad. What has been mentioned, may also have given somewhat more of an English air to Guernsey than Jersey possesses ; though this has been increased also by its greater distance from France, and diminished intercourse with that country ; but whether this is an advantage or not we shall not endeavour to decide. The aspect of these two islands, in point of surface, is perhaps more different than the manners and oc cupations of the people. Many of the lands, the high lands, and the sandy spots of the low ones especially, are destitute"], [399, ""], [400, "I \u25a0\u25a0? 4 S 3 S fi 3 *t *_. -_ __ \u00a9 _3 M \u00bb 3 is\" 68 * ! 5 1 t= \u25a0*** |S u] -s I.

In its season of bloom, this furze is showy, and it lets one see the country much better than it can be seen through the grove-like hedges of Jersey ; but furze is an enemy to those wild flowers Avhich constitute much of the summer beauty of a hedge ; and the decom position of it does not make so rich, or so copious an addi tion to vegetable mould, as the fallen leaves of the trees. Perhaps, however, it renders the climate more healthy, though even this is doubtful ; and, in situations far from the sea and searweed, there may be temptations to grow furze for fuel, on ground which might be turned to more valuable account. St. Peter's Port is the only town in the island ; but the greater part of it has the streets very confused, and the houses of mean appearance. From the sea, indeed, it looks well, being situated upon a rising bank ; and the buildings range, north and south, over a considerable distance, so that the whole of the town presents itself as one approaches it. The fish-market is one of the chief attractions of the old or seaward part of the town ; and every one must allow that it is very superior. This building is of modern construction, broad and lofty, and not much under 200 feet in length. It forms an arcade, with double rows of marble slabs for the display of the fish, and is kept sweet and clean by a copious supply of fresh water. It is also much better supplied than the Jersey market ; and the increase is chiefly on the better sorts of fish. Saturday is the market-day ; and in the morn ing of this day the fish-market is a treat for a genuine Lch thiophagist. The other markets are not so well supplied, \u2014 the fruit and vegetables especially, being of an inferior description. The environs of the town are a great improve ment on the old part, \u2014 the dwellings there being a very neat description of suburban villas, standing within their own grounds, which are often of considerable extent ; though in many instances that ground is laid out as much for show as for use. These suburban villas extend far to the right N"], [402, "92 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF and left, and reach even to the top of the hill, so that the whole collection presents a hill-side clad with houses. The population is upwards of 15,000. The parish churches in Guernsey are ten in number, and some of them are of early date. The oldest is St. Sampson's, near the shore of a small creek, and about a mile and a half north of Peter's Port. It is a small and somewhat barn-like structure, though more church-like than many in the island ; and it lies at no great distance from the ruins of the old castle of St. Michael, which is just across the creek, situated on an artificial mount, and has once been a place of great strength. The area within the walls is about an acre ; and these walls have been very strong. The governor of this castle used to be commander of this part of the district. St. Michael's, or the vale church, is on the opposite, or north western shore, though not above a mile and a half distant. It is rather a handsome old structure, with a tower and spire, and was, at one time, a considerable place of meeting. This church appears to have been erected in 1117. The next in order of date is St. Philip de Forteval, in the south west part of the island, which was erected in 1130; St. Saviour's, near the centre of this part of the island, was built in 1154; St. Margaret's, in the forest which occupies the middle of the south coast, in 1 163 ; St. Peter's, in the wood between the last and Forteval, in 1167; St. Martin's in the south-east ofthe island, in 1199; our Lady of the Castle, imthe centre of the island, opposite Peter's Port, in 1203 ; St. Andrew's, south of the castle, in 1284 ; and St. Peter's at the port, in 1312 ; so that all the churches in the island were built between the beginning of the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, and they appear to have undergone but little alteration since. Besides Vale castle, the ruins of which have been noticed, there are several other ancient castles in the island. The most striking in appearance is Castle Cornet, built on a rock, about half-a-mile from the harbour of the port; but surrounded by sea at all times of the tide.

The wife and mother of Lord Hatton, the governor of the island, and several other persons were killed ; but some were saved in an extraordinary manner. Among these Avas the gover nor, who, being asleep, Avas blown over the ramparts in his bed, and alighting between two rocks, bed and all, was awakened, as the report states, only by the drenching effects of a shower of rain, \u2014 proving that, though his lordship might have been a very good governor, he Avould not have done for a sentinel. The next castle to the north of St. Peter's Port, is another of the ruins of ancient times ; and Joy castle, still farther to the north, belongs also to the num ber. Of modern erections, Elizabeth college, and the public hospital, may be reckoned as among the most inte resting : the former is a sort of superior school, or intended to be so, as a preparatory seminary to the colleges at Ox ford ; or a substitute, in the case of those who cannot afford to finish their education at these. The hospital of Guernsey is an establishment of great value, and well conducted ; and has been established for nearly 100 years. It combines the various characters of an infirmary for the diseased, a poor house- for the decrepid, a refuge for the destitute, a work house for the unemployed, and a seminary of useful educa tion to such young persons as cannot find it elsewhere. The attention which is paid to all the departments of this establishment, and the abundant and wholesome, but not extravagant supply of food, to the inmates, are equally creditable to the humanity, good sense, and good taste, of the more opulent part of the Guernsey population. There are, in this delightful island, many subjects upon the descrip tion and the rationale of Avhich it would be both pleasant and profitable to dwell ; but four islands yet remain to be noticed ; and our stipulated pages are nearly at an end. THE ISLAND OF ALDERNEY. Alderney is of much smaller dimensions than either of the two islands already mentioned; the circumference of it does not exceed eight miles, including the principal irregu- n 2"], [410, "94 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF larities ; the area may be about three square miles, or 2000 acres, the whole is included in one parish, St. Anne ; and the church and village, or town, for it is the only one in the island, are situated near the centre ; and contains the majority of the 1045 persons that constitute the population of the island. The little harbour is on the south coast ; and on ac count of the strong tide which runs here, it is neither con venient nor safe. Essex castle is the only remain of anti quity in the island ; and, as shewn in the plate, is a mere ruin. Altogether, this island is much less accessible, and far less frequently visited than the others ; and the conse quence is, that the people are more primitive in their manners. The town is really a collection of farm-houses; the chief of which belong to the local magistrates, the king's officers, the parson, and the doctor ; and there are two or three shops here and there, together with a post-office. In consequence of this town being literally ras in urbe, both in its buildings, and their tenants, \u2014 the latter consisting of human beings, cows, pigs, poultry, and all other living things that make a farm-yard lively, \u2014 it occupies a very considerable space. The surface of Alderney consists of two parts, the cultivated land and the uncultivated. The usual law of holding in the Islands has made the cultivated land literally a thing of shreds and patches, in which, hedge and field, corn and grass, hay-ground and pasture, may be all found blended together on an area not much exceeding that of a large carpet. As is the case in Guernsey, the unculti vated land has a great tendency to be overrun with furze ; and the want of trees, or shelter of any kind, not only gives the land a barren appearance, but tends to make it barren. The cows of Alderney are very diminutive in size ; and do not appear to possess any superiority over others, except that they can live upon very little. Hogs are said to thrive well in this island ; and there are a good many sheep upon the uncultivated grounds, which, we believe, are the old hill breed, of small size, with coarse wool and dark faces ; but their wool is much stronger, and will last longer than those of the fine wools ; they are remarkably hardy, and their flesh is of the choicest flavour.

Through the channel of Cape La Hogue on the east, containing some of the most dangerous rocks, the tide runs with great velocity, and forms the Race of Alderney, so well known for its wild commotion and corresponding danger. The other sides of the island are rendered almost equally dangerous, from the extent and ruggedness of the rocky ledges which stretch far to seaward, approach in points or benches within various distances of the surface of the water ; and sometimes rising above it, especially at ebb tide, they divide the rushing current, which sweeps along with great power, into a vast number of parts, and turn those parts into an equally great number of directions. In consequence of this, the three elements, of rapid current, tumbling water, and boiling whirlpool, are mixed and confounded into the most extraordinary description of oceanic chaos that can be well imagined, \u2014 say that the general current, or mass of the waters clear of these rocks, sets eastward; the part which passes through among the points of rock, is turned, south- Avard in one part, northward in another, rushes forward in a third, recoils backward in a fourth \u2014 splashes upon and in masses, wells downward in circling hollows, so that, if it is urged on by a wind of any strength, the sight and sound of it are equally appalling to those who are not familiarly acquainted with it, and have overcome its dangers. This is \" the Swinge ; \" and to attempt passing the Swinge in stormy weather, or against the wind, would be a vain and hopeless matter. Even in the calmest weather it has a for midable appearance, except during the short time of the pause during slack water. But, even at the slack of high water, this pause is only momentary ; and the Swinge is again in motion. To attempt stemming it, if a sufficient con tinuance of tide, not only for clearing it, but for getting at some distance beyond it, is not made sure of, there is every chance of an involuntary return through the same turbulent sea : for, with the turn of the tide, there comes a return of the Swinge ;"], [418, "102 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS OF and it depends upon the state of the weather if it shall be more formidable one way or another. Vessels passing Alderney can keep clear of it ; but to land upon the island in a boat, some part at least of it must be encountered; and for this reason the steamers, which ply on the passage be tween England and the Islands, endeavour to find many excuses rather than touch at Alderney. The Race we believe is not quite so formidable in appearance ; but the current there is exceedingly rapid, very turbulent where the bottom is irregular, and the rocks are highly dangerous, except to such as are intimately acquainted with the Channel navigation. THE ISLAND OF CERQ. This is a small island of very peculiar form, about three miles in length, and not one mile broad. It consists of a sort of two parts, united by a natural bridge, or rather wall, of rock, about 250 feet long, and not more than four or five feet in width, between 200 and 300 feet above the level of the sea : a perfect precipice on the one side, and so steep and rugged on the other, that a descent is equally certain, and an ascent equally impracticable, in case of the traveller on the bridge missing a footstep, and slipping down the one way or the other. One way, it would be falling into the sea in one perpendicular drop ; and the other way, it would be rolling and bumping upon crag after crag with accelerated velocity as the descent got deeper ; and between these preludes to being drowned, it is not easy to draw any line of preference. Both parts of the island are precipitous all round, rising above the water like gigantic teeth ; and the inequalities of the surface of the little table lands which they form, are not greater, in proportion to the mass, than the ridges and furrows in the cheek-teeth of an elephant. Little Cerq is a heath, with no wood, and scarcely any inhabitants ; but great Cerq is an entire country, and a very peculiar one. The shores all round are steep, and often wildly caverned ; and at one of the entrances the visitant has to be drawn up the ascent by a rope ; and in another the passage is through"], [419, "ISLAND OF .VAHIi"], [420, ""], [421, ""], [422, "L r c :-_ E M X , fl,, F,i,iJ',.l,., I,,'/',/./,,.,, ,\u201e//\u25a0!, l'/r,rt-"], [423, "107 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. a portal of rock, which is partly artificial, and the passage through which might be easily defended by a very few indi viduals against a host of any numbers. From the nature of its shores, Cerq needs no artificial fort ; and, therefore, in the olden times it was, occasionally made a resort of pirates. The accounts say, that the said pirates were dislodged only by the policy of the Flemings, who, craving leave to bury their dead in the holy ground of the island, and coming per fectly unarmed for this occasion, brought with them a most ponderous coffin, filled not with bodies already dead, but with most efficient instruments of death ; and having closed the door of the chapel, they armed themselves with the contents of the chest, drove the pirates down to the little harbour be low the rocky gate, and finally expelled them the island. Whether this story be true or false, it is certain that this little island is very strong by nature. The rocks of Avhich it is composed are different from many of the others, for some of them are more nearly allied to the green-stone family, than to the granites ; and there are also some very singular veins. The arable land in Cerq is understood to be some thing more than a thousand acres, and the population more than 540, or fully half that of Alderney, while it is said that a portion of the produce is annually imported. The land is tolerably well cultivated ; and the crops of grain and roots are abundant. There are also a good many little orchards ; and the common fruits come to great perfection in the gardens. Cerq is under the management of one seignior or lord ; and the parliament consists of himself and his 40 tenants. The seneschal or president being nominated by the lord, who has also a veto in the acts of the assembly. The seneschal has power in civil cases ; but an appeal lies to the court in Guernsey. The lord of Cerq also appoints the law officers ; but the police are appointed by his tenants. The lord is en titled to one half of all unclaimed wrecks upon the shores ; so that there is a mixture of the patriarchal in the govern ment of this little island. Its militia amounts to about 100 ; and these are quite competent to its defence against every thing but treachery. Sea- weed is the staple manure, and"], [424, "108 TOPOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS. also chiefly the fuel, in Cerq as well as in the other Islands ; but it is not obtained on its coasts, but on those of the small islands afterwards to be noticed. Very near the west part of the island there is a little islet quite detached ; but which may once have been joined, as little Cerq is now. This islet was once a game preserve, that is, a rabbit-warren to the lord of Cerq ; but it has lately been added to the inha bited parts of his lordship's domain. The tide beats angrily through the passage of separation; and it is reported that ships have been forced safely through this passage ; but it is one which no seaman would voluntarily attempt. HERM AND JETHOU. Herm is about mid-way between Cerq and Guernsey ; and though the soil is not rich, a considerable part of the sur face is cultivated ; but far more is abandoned to furze and weeds. Stone quarries are among the most valuable products from this little island. The population altogether does not amount to more than 20 or 30. The peculiar set of tides here, which, by the way, breaks the current which would otherwise set severely from Guernsey, have accumulated a large bank of shells ; which, however, are merely those which at present inhabit the adjoining seas, and are washed ashore after their inhabitants have died. Jethou, near Herm, is a very small island, considerably elevated above the surface of the water ; and it contains one habitation, with an orchard and a few other trees ; and the rest is occupied as a rabbit-warren. There are some other islets and points of rock permanently above the water, upon which a plant or two, or at all events a lichen, may perhaps be observed; but what we have briefly enumerated com prise all that can be considered as The Channel Islands.
