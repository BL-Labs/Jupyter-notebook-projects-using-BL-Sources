Davies, in his Miscellanies (vol. 3 p. 391) says, that the stage perhaps never produced 4 such hand some women at once as Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Brace girdle, Mrs. Mountford, and Mrs. Bowman, and that when they appeared together in the last scene of the Old Batchelor, the audience was struck with so fine a group of beauty\u2014 this is a double mistake \u2014 the Old Batchelor came out in 1693 \u2014 Cibber says Mrs. Barry in 1690 was not a little past her youth \u2014 and Davies himself says p. 197. that as far as he could judge by Mrs. Barry's picture which he had seen, she had not been a great beauty \u2014 besides Mrs. Barry acted L\u00e6titia, and consequently was not on the stage in the last act \u2014 the 4th woman was Airs.

BEAUMONT and FLETCHER. A new edition of Beaumont and Fletcher was published in 1778 \u2014 the Editor of the B. D. says that Colman was the author of the preface \u2014which is pro bably correct\u2014 but if he wrote the preface, he was certainly (in part at least) the editor of the whole work and the writer of the new notes \u2014 he says \u2014 \" In the present Edition, it has been our chief aim \" to give the old text as it lies in the old books, with \" no other variations, but such as the writers them \" selves, had they superintended an impression of \" their Works, or even a corrector of the press, \" would have made \u2014 yet even these variations, if at \" all important, have not been made in silence \u2014 \" Notes however have been subjoined to the text as \" briefly and sparingly as possible \u2014 but the lapse of \" time, and fluctuation of language have rendered \" some Notes necessary, for the purpose of explaining \" obsolete words, unusual phrases, old customs, and \"obscure or distant allusions \u2014 critical remarks,"], [50, "40 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. \" and conjectural emendations, have been seldom \" hazarded.\" The paucity of notes is, perhaps, a recommenda tion of this edition\u2014 notes are sometimes necessary \u2014 but they are necessary evils \u2014 they always distract the attention of the reader from the text \u2014 Murphy remarks that all the beautiful passages of Shaks peare are plain \u2014 yet the notes on that author have swelled to such a bulk, that it is almost an Herculean task to read through them\u2014 the late Dr. Edwards of Clare Hall Cambridge was remarkably fond of the notes on the Greek and Latin writers \u2014 Mansel hap pily observed \u2014 \" how delightful it would be, to have \" all notes and no text.\" There is a fashion in the Drama, as well as in other things \u2014 Dryden in 1668 says that two of Fletcher's plays were acted to one of Shakspeare's. Gildon in 1710 gives us a list of 73 plays in which Betterton acted\u2014 of these about the same number was written by Fletcher as by Shakspeare\u2014 under the management of Wilks, Cibber and Booth, the Maid's Tragedy\u2014 Philaster\u2014 Scornful Lady \u2014 Wit without Money \u2014 Beggar's Bush\u2014 Humorous Lieu tenant \u2014 Rule a Wife \u2014 Chances, and Pilgrim were frequently acted \u2014other plays of Fletcher were some times revived\u2014 but no one of his dramas was acted as often as Hamlet, and some other of Shakspeare's best Tragedies. In 1750 Seward in his preface to Beaumont and Fletcher says \" the very best plays of Shakspeare \" were forced to be dressed fashionably by the poetic \" tailors of the late ages, before they could be admit \" ted upon the stage ; and a very few years since,"], [51, "BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. 41 \" his Comedies, in general, were under the highest \" contempt.\" At present Shakspeare is the fashion, and for the last 40 or 50 years 2 only of Fletcher's plays have been on the acting list regularly \u2014latterly even the Chances has been laid aside. Now that the tide is turned, doubtless there are many professed admirers of Shakspeare, who know but little of Fletcher \u2014 Fletcher's distance from Shakspeare may be accurately pointed out by a line in Virgil \u2014 \" Proximus hide \u2014 longo sed proximus intervallo,\" or as Colman says \u2014 \" Beaumont and Fletcher ! those twin stars that \" run \" Their glorious course round Shakspeare's gol- den sun.\" It is curious to observe the change that has taken place between the times when Beaumont and Flet cher wrote and our own \u2014 those expressions in their plays which are now considered as very gross, were so far from offending the ears of their contempora ries, that they are perpetually celebrated by the writers of their own and the following age, as the great reformers of the drama from ribaldry \u2014 Sir John Berkenhead says of Fletcher \" And as thy thoughts were clear, so innocent, \" Thy fancy gave no unswept language vent, \" Slander'st not laws, prophan'st no holy page, \" As if thy Father's crosier rul'd the stage.\""], [52, "42 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. Fletcher's father was Bishop of London. Langbaine in 1691 says \" these poets perfectly \" understood breeding, and therefore successfully \" copied the conversation of gentlemen they \" knew how to describe the manners of the age ; \" and Fletcher had a peculiar talent in expressing \" all his thoughts with life and briskness \u2014 no man \" understood or drew the passions more lively thanhe ; \" and his witty raillery was so dressed, that it rather \"pleased than disgusted the nwdest part of his \" audience.\" Beaumont and Fletcher themselves boast of this chastity of language \u2014 as in the Prologue to the Knight of the Burning Pestle \u2014in that to the Woman Hater they say \" if there be any amongst you that \" come to hear lascivious scenes let him depart \u2014 for \" we do pronounce this, to the utter discomfort of \" two-penny gallery-men, you shall have no bawdry \" in it.\" Lovelace speaks of the great delicacy of expres sion even in the Custom of the Country \u2014 \" View here a loose thought said with such a \" grace, \" Minerva might have spoke in Venus' face ; \" So well disguised, that 'twas conceived by none, \" But Cupid had Diana's linen on.\" Yet of this play Dryden asserts (not indeed with truth) that it contains more indecency than all his plays together\u2014 \" What\" (asks Seward in 1750) \" must we say of these different accounts ? Why \" 'tis clear as day, that the style of the age is so"], [53, "43 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. \" changed, that what was formerly not esteemed \" in the least degree indecent, is now become very \" much so.\" Perhaps there cannot be a stronger proof of the different light in which the same expression is con sidered in different times, than that in the 7th book of the Constitutions, falsely called Apostolical, there is a prayer, in which it is said \u2014 \" thou formest all \" the parts of the human body _v y,^rpa, i% px^aj \" (TTocyovog.

This T. is only an alteration of Dryden's Indian Emperour \u2014Brooke has in general written the dia logue afresh, but he sometimes uses Dryden's own words \u2014 in numberless instances he alters the words, but retains the sense of the passage \u2014 the first 2 acts differ but little from Dryden's \u2014 as the play proceeds, the difference becomes greater \u2014 but the most mate rial circumstances are the same in both plays\u2014 in the Indian Emperour, Cortez is released from prison by Vasquez and his party \u2014 Montezuma is put to the rack on the stage \u2014 Almeria wounds Cyderia, but does not kill her \u2014 Almeria kills herself \u2014 Brooke's language is superiour to Dryden's.

He says \" the following pages are meant to con \" tain a vindication of the works of Massinger, who \" very seldom falls much beneath the works of Shak \" speare himself, and sometimes almost rises to a \" proud rivalship of his chiefest excellencies \u2014 they \" are designed to rescue these admirable pieces from \" the too general neglect, which they now labour \" under, and to recommend them to the notice of \" the public. \" There is perhaps no country in the world more \" subordinate to the power of fashion than our own \u2014 \" hence it happens that the public taste is often vi \" tiated \u2014 or if by chance it has made a proper choice, \" it becomes partially attached to one species of ex \" cellence, and remains dead to the sense of all \" other merit, however equal or superiour. \" You have, Sir, in no fulsome strain of compli \" ment, been styled the best Commentator on the \" works of Shakspeare \u2014 but have you not like other \" commentators contracted a narrow exclusive vene \" ration for your author? has not the contemplation \" of Shakspeare's excellencies almost dazzled and \" extinguished your judgment, when directed to other \" objects, and made you blind to the merit of his \" contemporaries ? under your dominion have not \" Beaumont and Fletcher, nay even Jonson, suffered \" a sort of theatrical disgrace ? and has not poor \" Massinger been permitted to languish in obscurity, \" and remain almost entirely unknown?"], [131, "MASSINGER. 121 \" To this perhaps it may be plausibly answered, \" that many of our old plays, though they abound \" with beauties, and are raised much above the level \" of later writers, are yet on several accounts unfit \" to be exhibited on the modern stage. \" But your experience must have taught you, that \" when a piece has any striking beauties, they will *\u25a0' cover a multitude of inaccuracies, and that a play \" need not be written on the severest plan to please \" in the representation. \" The old plays are many of them a kind of hete \" rogeneous composition, few of them being strictly \" speaking Tragedy, Comedy, or even Tragi-comedy, \" but rather an undigested jumble of every species \" thrown together \u2014 the playbills I have observed \" cautiously style the Merchant of Venice, &c. \u2014 \" Plays \u2014 and Plays indeed they are ; truly such, if \" it be the end of plays to delight and instruct, to \" captivate at once the ear, the eye, and the mind, \" by situations forcibly conceived, and characters \" truly delineated \u2014 in point of character our old \" writers far transcend the moderns \u2014 the manners \" they represent, it is true, do not prevail at present ; \" but is it displeasing or uninstructive to see the \" manners of a former age pass in review before us ? \" or is the mind undelighted at recalling the charac \" ters of our ancestors, while the eye is confessedly \" gratified at the sight of the actors dressed in their \" antique habits ? \u2014 besides fashion and custom are \" so perpetually changing that some of our later \" plays are grown as obsolete in this particular, as \" those of the first writers \u2014 Bobadil is not more re \" mote from modern character than Lord Fopping-"], [132, "122 MASSINGER. \" ton \u2014 it may also be farther considered, that most of \" the best characters in our old plays are not merely \" fugitive and temporary \u2014 they were the delight of \" past times, and continue the admiration of the \" present. \" There is one circumstance peculiar to the old \" writers of which it is too little to say that it de \" mands no apology\u2014 it deserves the highest com \" mendation \u2014 I mean the poetical style of their \" dialogue \u2014 the mere modern critic, whose idea of \" blank verse is perhaps attached to that empty swell \" of phraseology so frequent in our late Tragedies, \" may consider this notion as the effect of bigotry to \" our old authors, rather than the result of impartial \" criticism \u2014 let such an one carefully read over the \" works of those writers for which I am an advocate \" \u2014 there he will seldom or ever find that tumour of \" blank verse to which he has been so much accus \" tomed \u2014 he will be surprised with a familiar dig \" nity, which, tho' it rises somewhat above ordinary \" conversation, is rather an improvement than per \" version of it \u2014 he will soon be convinced that blank \" verse is by no means appropriated solely to the \" Buskin, but that the hand of a master may mould \" it to whatever purposes he pleases ; and that in \" Comedy it will not only admit humour, but heighten \" and embellish it \u2014 instances of which might be pro \" duced without number. \" But to conclude\u2014 Have I, Sir, been wasting my \" time in vain ?

The author of the State of the Stage in 1753 describes an actor, who was emphatically wrong in almost every thing he repeated, whom he was happy to miss from the London stage, and whose vanity annually entertained the town with a Lear or Ham let for his own benefit \u2014 it is sufficiently clear that this was meant for Lee. Kelly in his Thespis 1766 speaks highly of Lee, not however without allowing that he had some un pleasant peculiarities in his manner of speaking \u2014 he commends him particularly in Aboan \u2014 Vernish \u2014 Young Belmont \u2014 Iago and Pierre \u2014 Kelly may have been too partial to Lee, but his criticism is well written. Cooke in his Life of Macklin says \u2014 \" Lee's Iago \" was very respectable, and showed a good judgment \" and thorough representation of the character \u2014 \" this actor was not without considerable pretensions, \" were they not more than allayed by his vanity \u2014 \" he had a good person, a good voice, and a more \" than ordinary knowledge in his profession, which \" he sometimes showed without exaggeration ; but \" he wanted to be placed in the chair of Garrick, \" and in attempting to reach this he often deranged \" his natural abilities\u2014 he was for ever, as Foote \" said, ' doing the honours of his face' \u2014 he affected"], [176, "bath 1779-1780. 166 \" uncommon Jong pauses, and frequently took such \" out-of-the-way pains with emphasis and articula \" tion, that the natural actor seldom appeared.\" Wilkinson says that on the revival of the Refusal at C. G. in 1750-1751 Lee acted Granger ; but Gar rick put the law in force against him for breach of his articles, and he was obliged to return to D. L., where Garrick from that day held a rod of iron over him \u2014 Wilkinson is no doubt correct as to the main point, but Lee had been a year at C. G. before he acted Granger \u2014 see Lee's characters for the parts which Garrick made him act \u2014 Lee is said to have had a peculiar oddity of temper. Some persons who knew Lee at Bath say that he wrote the Chapter of Accidents, and not Miss Lee \u2014 Lee would naturally give his daughter what assist ance he could, but the play is so good, that it is not likely he should have written any considerable part of it \u2014 Miss Lee's other works put it past a doubt that her abilities were very superiour to those of her father \u2014in the preface to her C. she says \u2014 \" I accompanied \" my father 8 years ago into the rules of a prison, \" where the perjury of an enemy, and the injustice \" of a judge for a time confined him\" \u2014 she adds, that she began the Chapter of Accidents to amuse some of her melancholy leisure \u2014 Lee's abilities for writing, or altering plays, were certainly slender \u2014 his alteration of Macbeth is said in the B. D. to have been contemptible to the last degree, and the two Farces which he borrowed from Wycherley and Van burgh do him but little credit\u2014 at the time when he had the command of the Bath prompt-book, he altered some plays in so bad a manner, that Kemble,"], [177, "bath 1779-1780. 167 when he came to Bath, refused to act in them, till they were restored to their proper state.

Ph\u0153niss\u00e6\u2014 Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of \u0152dipus, had agreed to reign alternately, year by year\u2014 at the end of the first year, Eteocles had refused to resign the throne to Polynices, and had driven him into banishment \u2014 Polynices had married the daughter of Adrastus the King of Argos \u2014 he returns with an army, and besieges Thebes \u2014 Polynices is prevailed on by Jocasta to have a conference with Eteocles \u2014 Jocasta endeavours to reconcile her two sons \u2014 but in vain \u2014 this is a very good scene \u2014 Eteocles and Polynices fight\u2014 they kill one another\u2014 Jocasta kills herself \u2014 the Argives are defeated \u2014 Creon, the bro ther of Jocasta, succeeds to the throne \u2014 he banishes \u0152dipus \u2014 and decrees that no one should dare to bury Polynices \u2014 the Chorus consists of Ph\u0153nician women \u2014 hence the title of the play. 4.

Andromache \u2014 Neoptolemus, on the taking of Troy, had received Andromache as a gist from the Grecians \u2014 he had had a son by her, called Molossus \u2014 after which, he had married Hermione \u2014 at the opening of the play he is absent from home \u2014 Her mione, from jealousy, wishes to put Andromache and her child to death \u2014 Menelaus assists her \u2014 just as they are about to effect their purpose, Peleus enters, and rescues Andromache and Molossus from their hands \u2014 Hermione fears that Neoptolemus will take vengeance on her \u2014 Orestes enters, and easily prevails on Hermione to go off with him \u2014 news are brought of the death of Neoptolemus \u2014 Thetis ap pears and consoles Peleus \u2014 Racine has borrowed the foundation of his Andromache from this play, but nothing more \u2014 Neoptolemus and Pyrrhus are the same person. 8.

Mrs. Yates' last appearance on the stage was for Mrs. Bellamy's benefit, but not intentionally so ; for Mrs. Crawford told my friend Mr. Simons, that she and Mrs. Yates had formed a plan to act together in the same Tragedies in opposition to Mrs. Siddons ; but this plan was not put into execution owing to Mrs. Yates' illness \u2014 she died in 1787 \u2014 she was en gaged at Edinburgh in 1785 \u2014 on her return she acted Margaret of Anjou at York April 26th \u2014 this was her last performance, but one ; and on that night she acted as well as Wilkinson had ever seen her.

Wilkinson speaks of her elegance and various ex cellencies, and adds that her Margaret of Anjou stood as much unrivalled as Mrs. Siddons' Zara.

John Henderson, as an actor, had many disadvan tages to cope with ; his height was below the common standard \u2014 his limbs were ill proportioned, they were too short ; he had not much of that flexibility of countenance, which anticipates the tongue ; that language of the eye, which prepares the spectator for the coming sentence, enchains attention and en sures partiality ; his voice wanted the silver tones which charm the ear, and was deficient in that dig nified strength which commands respect ; it was not suited to the softness of love, or the rage of tyranny \u2014but the solidity of his judgment, and the fervency of his mind, broke through all the mounds which nature seemed to have placed between him and ex cellence ; his comprehension was ample, his know ledge diversified, and his elocution accurate\u2014 where sensible recitation was the leading feature of a cha racter, he had no superiour \u2014 in the variety of Shak speare's soliloquies where more is meant than meets D D 2"], [414, "c.g. 1785-1786. 404 the ear, he had no equal absolute perfection is not the lot of humanity ; the relative merit of an actor is the criterion, by which he must be tried ; and in this point of view Henderson's merit stands very high\u2014 his range was extensive, (especially in Comedy) not so much for the number of parts, as for their opposition of character \u2014 in the flimsy decla mation of modern Tragedy he added little to his reputation ; Shakspeare was the deity he worshipped ; he entered into the spirit of the characters drawn by him, and, feeling with enthusiasm, executed them with ardour \u2014 {Ireland)\u2014 \\n his attention to the busi ness of the scene he was not exceeded even by Gar rick \u2014 {Davies)\u2014 his best parts were Shylock, Sir Giles Overreach and Falstaff \u2014 (Cumberland) \u2014 being unacquainted with fencing or dancing, his de portment was neither easy or disengaged, and in scenes where the former accomplishment was neces sary, he appeared to great disadvantage. He had uncommon powers of imitation, and gave with the voice and gesture, the countenance, turn of thought and language of the person whose manner he assumed. His mode of preparation was almost invariably this \u2014 when a new part was assigned to him, he first read the play \u2014 a practice which seems not to be uni versal with performers \u2014 he then imprinted the words of the character upon his memory, which to him was not a very difficult task \u2014 he looked over the whole play a second time, and then laid it aside ; and though this ceremony was frequently performed a fortnight before the representation, he seldom looked at it again\u2014 the evening, on which he was to"], [415, "c.g. 1785-1786. 405 appear, was usually preceded by a hearty dinner, a cheerful but moderate glass of wine, and a game at cribbage\u2014 which was almost always his amusement, until a few minutes before the curtain drew up, and he was obliged, sometimes very unwillingly, to ap pear on the stage\u2014 he was strongly recommended by a friend to imitate Garrick's conduct, who, when he had a new or capital character to act, saw no com pany that day and dined alone upon some trifling dish \u2014 in consequence of this advice, he once changed his custom, retired to his chamber, and studied his part on the day of playing \u2014 the consequence was a coldly correct and vapid performance ; which con vinced his friends, that his practice was right, at least for himself \u2014 and he seriously vowed that no power on earth should induce him to repeat the experiment. From the time of his appearing on a London theatre, he was overwhelmed with indiscriminate and ill-judged flattery \u2014 this might serve the manager, but it injured the player and inflated the man \u2014 Hen- derson himself said, that no actor could perform well, unless he were flattered both on and off the stage \u2014 (Ireland) \u2014 this is going too far \u2014 but every person who knows any thing of theatricals must have observed, that the same actors, in the same piece and the same theatre, have sometimes produced a different effect and met with a quite different reception \u2014 if the audience be not in humour, the performers, let them go on in their best spirits, will flag\u2014 on the contrary, if the audience be in good humour, the performers, tho' out of health and spirits, when they go on the stage, will be transformed and alert Wilkinson says that the York audience was particu-"], [416, "406 c. g. 1785-1786. larly lukewarm as to applause, and that Woodward was so hurt, the first night he acted there, at his re ception, that he as manager, was under the necessity of calling on all his acquaintance to assure them, that Woodward was so chagrined at their coolness, that he could not act so well as at London, Dublin, or Edinburgh\u2014 they took the hint, and the next night when he acted Bobadill and the Apprentice, he was so surprised and elated at the different mode of his reception, that he sat up till 2 o'Clock after his fatigue (at the age of 57) in the highest spirits Mrs. Sid dons said that the fatigue of acting Isabella in the country was double to that of acting the part in London, as the frequent applause she received at D.

Wilkinson settled at York, as a sort of joint ma nager with Baker, in Jan. 1766, and some time after he obtained a regular Patent for the York and Hull theatres\u2014 he says he was at first extremely delighted with the idea of becoming manager, but he was soon convinced by experience of the never ceasing trouble that daily attends the attempt to guide a company of Comedians, whose various tempers, in terests and expectations, are to the full as difficult to satisfy as the Public. One of the first things he endeavoured to do, was to put a stop to the degrading manner in which the Performers used to solicit the attendance of the in habitants to their benefits \u2014 he properly observes, that it was shocking to see a man of Frodsham's birth and education running after, or stopping a Gentleman on horseback, to deliver his benefit bill, and beg half a crown, which was then the price of the boxes \u2014 there were other humiliating circum stances to which they had been accustomed \u2014 when Wilkinson attempted a reform, the actors opposed it, tho' they had before complained to him of the hardships they underwent \u2014 however when he became Patentee he was resolute and carried his point. He is said to have been a very kind manager, and to have assisted young performers of merit in getting a London engagement instead of keeping them back. Wilkinson was beyond a doubt an excellent Mimic \u2014 what sort of an Actor he was, it is not so easy to determine \u2014 as he was fond of rambling, and was seldom engaged regularly at the London theatres,"], [531, "YORK 1788. 521 very little is recorded of him, except in his own Me moirs \u2014 his Tragedy seems to have been bad\u2014 and if he gained applause (as he says of himself) in Lear and Zanga it was in all probability from his imitation of Garrick and Mossop \u2014 in Comedy he is said to have had considerable merit \u2014 but even there it may be questioned whether he was much of an original actor \u2014 the Dramatic Censor says that in the Commis sary he would please those who had not seen Foote \u2014 Garrick with much propriety called him an Exotic. Wilkinson observes that one great point in an Imi tator is to make his face like that of the person imi tated \u2014 Kelly, the singer, had heard King assert, that Wilkinson, ugly as he was, could make his face re semble that of Mrs. Woffington\u2014 this induced Kelly to request Wilkinson to make Mrs. Woffington's face for him \u2014 Wilkinson good-naturedly did so, and to Kelly's astonishment, really made a handsome one. (Kelly.) Wilkinson, in 1790, published the Memoirs of his own Life in 4 vols. small 8vo.\u2014 they are peculiarly entertaining, and afford a vast deal of real informa tion, relative to the London and Dublin theatres- Wilkinson has likewise the merit of being more accu rate than the generality of theatrical writers.

Did Kemble suppose that Tullus had a statue of Mars in his chimney corner? \u2014 the scene between Coriolanus and Tullus is from Shakspeare \u2014 as well as the following short one at Rome \u2014 when Coriola nus and Tullus enter with Volusius and the soldiers, the whole is from Thomson \u2014 the concluding scene is judiciously compiled from Shakspeare with slight additions.

Coriolanus proved to be Kemble's grand part \u2014 Mrs. Siddons acted Volumnia very well, but she had not the good sense to follow Mrs. Woffington's example as to her face \u2014 she was on the stage, as off, Kemble's sister not his mother. Coriolanus was printed in 1789 with the variations in the manager's book at D. L. \u2014 the alteration is in the titlepage attributed to T.

G. by Macklin in the King's Bench \u2014 much is taken from other theatrical works without any acknowledgement \u2014 and in the 1st vol. pp. 130-131 \u2014 Kirkman has confounded the Provoked Wife with the Provoked Husband in a most extra ordinary way \u2014 any body may make a mistake ; but such a gross mistake as this, shows that he was very ignorant of the Drama, and consequently badly qualified to write the life of an actor \u2014 the only inte resting part of these vols. is that which he seems to have compiled from Macklin's papers, or to have heard from his own mouth ; and this might have been told with ease in 200 or 300 pages instead of 900. Another Life of Charles Macklin, in one vol. 8vo., was written by Cooke the Barrister, but published, .ii _\u00bb _ j _"], [565, "c. g. 1788-1789. 555 in 1804, without his name\u2014 it is very superiour to Kirkman's\u2014 it contains much valuable information, together with many things which were not worth re cording\u2014a great deal is borrowed from Davies and others, with little or no acknowledgement \u2014 there are some woful mistakes, and many inaccuracies\u2014 see pp. 356, 383 and 393. Congreve, in 1798, published his Memoirs of Macklin\u2014 this is a pamphlet of 60 pages\u2014 it contains much information\u2014 Congreve gives a better account of the early part of Macklin's theatrical life than either Kirkman or Cooke. Kirkman tells us that Macklin, in acting Shylock on Jan. the tenth 1788, found his memory fail him, and was obliged to make an apology ; and that the same thing happened again, when he played Sir Per tinax on Nov. the twenty eighth 1788 \u2014 Congreve says, that Macklin's memory failed him in Sir Per tinax on Nov. the twenty eighth 1788, and again in Shylock on Jan. 10 1789 \u2014 Cooke copies Congreve \u2014 no one of them is quite correct \u2014 Macklin's first failure was in Shylock Jan. 10 1788 \u2014 his second in Sir Pertinax Nov. the twenty sixth I788 \u2014 Ayre's Sunday Gazette for Jan. IS 1788 says \u2014 \"On Thurs \" day Macklin made his 1st appearance this season \" in Shylock and Sir Archy to a most crowded and \" brilliant house : in the beginning of the 2d act he \" was taken so ill that apprehensions were enter \" tained he would die on the stage ; he came forward \" and addressed the audience nearly in the following \" words\u2014' Ladies and Gentlemen\u2014 within these few \" hours I have been seized with a terror of mind I \" never in my life felt before\u2014 it has totally destroyed"], [566, "556 c. g. 1788-1789. \" my corporeal as well as mental faculties \u2014 I must \" therefore request your patience this night \u2014 a re \" quest which an old man of 89 years of age may \" hope is not unreasonable\u2014 should it be granted, \" you may depend this will be the last night, unless \" my health shall be entirely re-established, of my \" ever appearing before you in so ridiculous a situa \u00ab tion ' this address met with the most enthusi \" astic warmth of reception \u2014 the play went on, and \" Macklin at times gave the most brilliant proof's \" that old Shylock had not totally forgotten his bond.\" His last attempt on the stage was May 7 1789 for his bt. \u2014 the manager was fearful he would not be able to go through his part, and Ryder was prepared to go on, if necessary. When Macklin had dressed himself for Shylock with his usual accuracy, he went into the Green room and coming up to Mrs. Pope said, \" My dear, \" are you to play to night ?\"\u2014 \" to be sure I am Sir \" \u2014 why don't you see I am dressed for Portia ? \" \u2014 \" ah ! very true ; I had forgotten \u2014 but who is to play \" Shylock ? \" \u2014 the imbecile tone of voice, and the inanity of look, with which this last question was asked, caused a melancholy sensation in all who heard it \u2014 at last Mrs. Pope, rousing herself, said, \" why \" you to be sure ; are you not dressed for the part ? \" \u2014 he then seemed to recollect himself, and putting his hand to his forehead, pathetically exclaimed, \" Heaven help me\u2014 my memory, I am afraid, has \" left me.\" He however, after this, went upon the stage and delivered 2 or 3 speeches of Shylock in a manner that evidently proved he did not understand what he"], [567, "c. g. 1788-1789. 557 was repeating\u2014 after a while he recovered himself a little, and seemed to make an effort to rouse himself; but in vain\u2014 nature could assist him no further, and after pausing some time, as considering what to do, he then came forward and informed the audience \" that he now found he was unable to proceed in the \" part, and hoped they would accept Mr. Ryder as \" his substitute, who was already prepared to finish \" it \" \u2014 the audience accepted his apology with a mixed applause of indulgence and commiseration \u2014 and he retired from the stage for ever. (Cooke.) Macklin's voice was strong, clear, important, and sufficiently variable for the parts he generally played ; he managed it in such a manner that the terminations of his sentences were as well heard as the middle parts ; a point to which he was particularly attentive in his own acting, and which he inculcated into all his various pupils \u2014 with these requisites he was always perfect, tho' he had not naturally a quick study \u2014 his acting was chaste, he seldom or never in troduced any stage tricks. Shylock was his great character \u2014 in the transitions from grief to joy in the 3d act, he stands, and pro bably always will stand, unrivalled \u2014 in the trial scene he had such an iron-visaged look, such a relentless savage cast of manners, that the audience seemed to shrink from the character \u2014 some great actors have played Shylock since his time, but no one of his successors could whet the knife like Macklin \u2014 his other principal characters were\u2014 Sir Pertinax\u2014 Sir Archy\u2014 Iago\u2014 Sir Gilbert Wrangle \u2014 Sir Francis Wronghead- Sir Paul Plyant\u2014 Trappanti\u2014 Scrub\u2014 the Miser \u2014 Polonius \u2014 Peachum, &c\u2014 as to the"], [568, "558 c. g. 1788-1789. higher walks of Tragedy, such as Richard and Mac beth, which he latterly attempted (with some abate ment in favour of his knowledge in the outlines of these characters) they must be considered as the reveries of approaching dotage \u2014 on the whole he was an actor in some parts original, in many respect able, and in the walks of low Comedy and Farce, one of the first of his own times. Those who knew Macklin most intimately, after his retirement from the stage, never once had a no tion but that he had sufficiently provided for his inde pendence ; yet the fact turned out otherwise \u2014 with all the advantages he possessed of making a provision for old age, he either altogether neglected it, or de pended too much on the continuance of strong health to \u0153conomise in time \u2014 he was besides this fond of law-suits ; he often did not see things in the clearest light \u2014 he thought too, that he understood law better than he really did ; and he had ever a jealousy of being imposed on by managers, so that, from a com bination of all these circumstances, he was seldom out of the Courts. In the management of his private affairs, he was always a reserved man \u2014 his engagements, his dis bursements, &c. were all of his own arrangement, without any permitted interference of his family ; when his wife was allowed for the first time to in spect his affairs, she found his whole remaining for tune did not consist of above \u00a360 in money and an annuity of \u00a310 per annum. Friends were immediately consulted on what was best to be done ; it was first proposed to procure a benefit, and the manager of C. G. liberally offered his"], [569, "c. g. 1788-1789. 559 house free of all expenses\u2014 it was however very pru dently re-considered that a benefit could not possibly embrace the gratuities of all friends scattered in dif ferent parts of the three kingdoms\u2014 the plan was therefore changed to that of publishing the Man of the World and Love a-la-Mode by subscription ; and Murphy, who suggested the plan, followed it up by offering to become the editor, and by writing a suit able address to the public. (Cooke.) In 1793 the two pieces were published handsomely printed in 4to., with a portrait of Macklin\u2014 a copy of Murphy's address, a list of the subscribers, and an account of the expenditure of the money received \u2014 the usual subscription was a Guinea, but many persons gave more, so that the whole amounted to \u00a31582 : 11 : 0 \u2014 the greater part of this sum was laid out in the purchase of an annuity of \u00a3200 for Mack lin, and of \u00a375 for his wife, in case she should sur vive \u2014 the surplus was paid to Macklin for his imme diate occasions. (Murphy.) Macklin died July 11 1797, by his own computa tion only 98, but on very strong and probable cir cumstances, at the very advanced age of 108 \u2014 (Cooke) \u2014 his widow had a benefit at C. G. June 17 1805. The Man of the World and Love a-la-Mode had not been published till 1793, except surreptitiously. Kirkman says\u2014\" Macklin's character stood very \" high for humanity, generosity, and charity\u2014 his \" conduct through life was highly honourable, manly, \" and firm \u2014 he was fond of conviviality and good \" humour without transgressing the laws of decency \u00ab he was always attentive to please, but never"], [570, "560 c.g. 1788-1789. \" stooped to meanness or officiousness \u2014 his house \" was always open to the needy and distressed \u2014 and \" for his council and instruction any stage candidate \" or brother actor, might readily apply,\" &c. &c. Cooke adds, that he was remarkable for his justice and punctuality in pecuniary concerns \u2014 and that as the head of a family, nothing could be more correct and respectable than his conduct ; for though he ivould ride before sometimes, this once understood and submitted to, every thing was conducted with liberality and propriety \u2014 he was beyond a doubt an excellent father. As Kirkman and Cooke may reasonably be sus pected of a little partiality to a man with whom they were intimate, and whose life they had written ; it will not be amiss to compare their account with what Holcroft says of him. \" Macklin's body, like his mind, was cast in a \" mould as rough as it was durable ; his aspect and \" address confounded his inferiours ; and the delight \" which he took in making others fear and admire \" him, gave him an aversion from the society of \" those whose knowledge exceeded his own \u2014 nor was \" he ever heard to allow superiority in any man. \u2014 he \" had no respect for the modesty of youth or sex, \" but would say the most discouraging as well as \" the grossest things ; and felt pleasure in propor \" tion to the pain he gave \u2014 it was common with him \" to ask his pupils, why they did not rather think of \" becoming bricklayers than players \u2014 he was impa \" tient of contradiction to an extreme ; and when he \" found fault, if the person attempted to answer, he \" stopped him, without hearing, by saying, \u00ab Ha,"], [571, "c. ft. 1788-1789. 561 \" you have always a reason for being in the wrong' \" \u2014this impatience carried him still farther\u2014 it often \" rendered him exceedingly abusive\u2014 blockhead, fool, \" scoundrel, were familiar expressions with him \u2014 his \" passions were so irritable, that the least opposition \" was construed into an unpardonable insult ; and \" the want of immediate apprehension in his pupils \" subjected them to the most galling contempt, which \" excited despair instead of emulation \u2014 his judgment \" was however in general sound, and his instructions \" those of a master \u2014 in short (says Holcoft) if I \" may estimate the sensations of others by my own, \" those despots, who, as we are told, shoot their \" attendants for their diversion, are not regarded \" with more awe than Macklin was by his pupils \" and domestics.\" In 1770-1771 Holcroft went to Dublin under the patronage of Macklin \u2014 Macklin seems to have used Holcroft very ill \u2014 for particulars see Holcroft's Me moirs.

Reynolds in 1634 published a small folio called \" God's Revenge against Murther\" \u2014 it consists of 30 Histories \u2014 Middleton and Rowley founded their play on the 4th of them, but with considerable alte rations \u2014 in particular, they have greatly improved the character of Deflores \u2014 or rather invented a new character with that name \u2014 in the story he is a young gentleman, with whom Beatrice willingly commits adultery, after her marriage with Alse mero \u2014 Alsemero catches them in the act, and kills them both. The Changeling is a very good play \u2014 a consider able part of it consists of a comic underplot \u2014 Alibius, the husband of Isabella, is a Doctor of Physic who undertakes the care of fools and madmen \u2014 two Gen tlemen, Antonio and Franciscus, in order to get"], [593, "u. l. 1789-1790. 583 access to Isabella, pretend, the former to be a Change ling or idiot, the latter to be a madman\u2014 Antonio, who gives the title to the play, is a character of no great importance\u2014 the authors should have called their piece by some name which would have had reference to Deflores\u2014 Lucan might have furnished them with a most appropriate motto\u2014\" Facinus, \" quos inquinat, cequat.\" The Editor of the old plays reprinted in 1814 and IS 15 says, that Hayley was evidently not aware of the existence of the Changeling\u2014 but a concise sketch of the story could only have furnished Hayley with the grand incidents, whereas there is a striking re semblance between the two plays, not only in many minute circumstances, but also in parts of the dia logue \u2014 after the murder, Beatrice offers Deflores \" three thousand golden florins \" \u2014 Deflores replies \u2014 Do you place me in the rank of verminous fellows, To destroy things for wages ? offer gold For the life blood of man ? is any thing Valued too precious for my recompense ?

Hayley made such alterations in the story as he thought necessary to fit it for a modern theatre\u2014 he represents Marcella as infinitely less culpable than Beatrice \u2014 consequently she is not in the power of Hernandez, as Beatrice is in the power of Deflores \u2014 she can hardly be called a murderess \u2014 she had only desired Hernandez to \" devise some \" lucky artifice to lure the ring from Lupercio \" \u2014 Hernandez has no sufficient ground for his presump tion \u2014 nor Marcella any strong reason to dread a dis covery \u2014 Middleton has conducted his plot in a more probable manner than Hayley \u2014 Middleton's language is more animated ; Hayley's more correct. Hayley assigns some reasons why he did not write a play when the story was first recommended to him \u2014 and why he afterwards did write Marcella \u2014 the true reason doubtless was, that he met with the Changeling in the interim\u2014 if Hayley had been to tally silent, he would have done no more than had been done by other plagiaries ; but by affecting to tell the truth, and yet concealing the most material part of it, he has acted in a most disengenuous man ner he was evidently one of those persons who have no objection to deceive, provided they can do it with out exactly advancing a falsehood\u2014 in the preface to his plays (three Comedies and two Tragedies) he is very cautious\u2014 his words are\u2014\" I am not conscious \" of having borrowed a single character or situation \" from any comic writer whatever \"\u2014he does not venture to say tragic."], [596, "d. l. 1789-1790. 586 The more conversant any person is with plays, the less he will be inclined to place any great confidence in the assertions of dramatic writers, where plagia rism is concerned\u2014 see particularly Metamorphosis L.
