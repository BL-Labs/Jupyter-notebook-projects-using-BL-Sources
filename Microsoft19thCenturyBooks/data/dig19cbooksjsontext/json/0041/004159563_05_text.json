P\\ERBYSHIRE, which took its name from the county town, was, in the \u2022*-J. time of the Britons, part of a large district inhabited by the Coritani, During the government of the Romans, it formed part of Britannia Prima. When England became divided, under the Saxon Monarchs, into seven kingdoms, called the Heptarchy, Derbyshire constituted part of Mercia, and Repton, then called Repandune, appears to have been a residence of the Mercian Kings. The inhabitants of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire were called the North Mercians, as living for the most part north of the river Trent ; and these two counties long continued to be so far connected in civil polity, that they had but one sheriff for both, till the year 1569. The assizes for both counties were held at Nottingham till the reign of Henry III. They were then held at Nottingham and Derby alternately, till 1569 ; since which time, the assizes for this county have been uniformly held at Derby, except in the year 161 o, when on account of a commotion at Derby, they were, on that occasion, removed to Ashborne. The Epiphany, Easter, and Michael mas sessions, are now held at Derby, and the Midsummer sessions, at Ches terfield. From the year 161 8 till 1797, the Michaelmas sessions had been held at Chesterfield, and the summer sessions at Bakewell. The Duchy of Lancaster court for the recovery of small debts, the punishment of trespasses, assaults, &c, which is held at Sudbury, extends its jurisdiction over the whole county, except the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. a 2 The"], [22, "DERBYSHIRE. IV The Peverell court of the same nature a, held at Basford in Nottingham shire, extends its jurisdiction over many of the townships in the hundred of Scarsdale, the Peak, and the wapentake of Wirksworth. The barmote courts for the regulation of the mineral concerns of Derby shire, and determining all disputes relating to the working of the mines, are held at Monyash, in the Peak, and at Y/irksworth.b Philip Kinder, in the preface to his intended History of Derbyshire, written about the middle of the seventeenth century, has the following ob servations relating to the character and modes of living of the inhabitants of Derbyshire. \" The common sort of people, out of a genuine reverence, not forced by feare or institution, doe observe those of larger fortunes, courteous and readie to show the waies and helpe a passenger : you may say they are lazie and idle in a better sense, for (except the grooves) they have not whereon to set themselves on worke, for all theire harvest and sede tyme is finished in six weeks ; the rest of their tyme they spend in fothering yr cattle, mending their stone inclosures, and in sports. \" The countrie women here are chast and sober, very diligent in their huswifery ; they hate idleness, love and obey their husbands, only in some of the great townes, many seeming sanctificators use to follow the presby terian gang, and upon a lecture day, putt on theire best rayment, and hereby take occasion to goo a gossiping. Your merry wives of Bentley will some tymes look in ye glass, chirpe a cupp merrily, yet not indecently. In the Peake they are much given to dance after the baggpipes, almost every towne hath a baggpipe in it. \u00ab Their exercises, for the greate part, is the Gymnopaidia, or naked boy, an ould recreation among the Greeks, with this in foote-races, you shall have in a winters day, the earth crusted over with ice, two agonists, stark naked, runn a foot race for 2 or 3 miles, with many hundred spec tators, and the betts very small. \" They love their cards. The miners at Christmas tyme, will carry tenn or twenti pounds about them, game freely, returne home againe, all the yeare after good husbands. * Mrs. Hutchinson, in her memoirs of her husband, speaks of this as an obsolete court, lately revived, in the reign of Charles I. See p. 1 13, 1 14. Under the grant to Lord Middleton, the jurisdiction of this court was extended to many places in Derbyshire, which never formed part of the honor of Peverell. See a list of the Derbyshire townships within this jurisdiction, in the second volume of Pilkington's Derbyshire. Several erroneous names occur in this list,' as they do, indeed, in the original charter. b See the account of Lead-Mines, &c. \"For"], [23, "DERBYSHIRE.

Historical Events. We have no notices of the military transactions of the Romans in this county. The first historical event which we find on record relating to Der byshire, is the invasion of the Danes in 874, when they expelled Burrhed from his kingdom, and fixed their head-quarters at Repandun\u2122 (now Repton), which had been the royal residence. The Danish army left Repton the next year, in two divisions ; Healfden marching with a detach ment into Northumberland ; and Godrun, and the other generals, with the main body, into Cambridgeshire.\" In the year 91 70, or, according to some writers, 91 8 p, the brave Ethelfleda, h The battle of Lutzen, 1632, in which Gustavus, King of Sweden, lost his life.

VII Countess of Mercia, daughter of King Alfred, recovered Derbyshire from the Danes. The Danish army, which was quartered at Derby, not venturing to come out and oppose her in the field, she boldly attacked the castle, and after a severe struggle, in which four of her bravest and favourite \"generals were killed at the entrance, she broke down the gate and walls, and took it by storm.' After this, Derby fell again into the hands of the Danes ; for we are told that King Edmund took it from them, with four other towns5 , in 942. Some years before this (in 924), King Edward having marched with his army from Nottingham to Bakewell, commanded a fortress to be built in the neighbourhood of the latter place.1 It appears, that during the rebellion of Prince Henry against his father Henry II. the castle of Duffield, in this county, was held against the King, by Robert Earl Ferrars ; for it is related, that, among others who came to make their submission to the victorious monarch, in the month of July, 1 174, was that Earl, who then delivered into the King's hands, the castles of Tutbury and Duffield.\" During the civil war in King John's reign (in 121 5), William Earl Ferrars, with an armed force, took Bolsover and Peak Castles, which were then in the possession of the rebellious barons.\" In the year 1264, King Henry III. sent his son, Prince Edward, into Derbyshire, to wreak vengeance upon Robert Earl of Derby, then one of the most active of the Barons in rebellion against him ; with instructions to lay waste his manors with fire and sword. The Earl, having made his peace, by the promise of a large sum of money ; and having taken fresh oaths of allegiance, broke both his oaths and his promise, and appeared in arms again in Derbyshire, in the year 1266, with Baldwin Wake, (Lord of Chesterfield), John D'Egville, and other Barons and Knights, and assembled a numerous force at Duffield-Frith, whence they marched to Chesterfield. Here they were surprised in their quarters by Henry, the King's nephew, and the greater part of them put to the sword. The Earl of Derby was taken prisoner, having been betrayed as it is said by a woman, who pointed out the place of his concealment in the church. v Wake, D'Egville, and the other Barons and Knights, made their escape. Some of the Knights, *> Some of the Historians call them fortissimos. The Sax. Chron. adds, qui ei chariores fuerunt. ' Hen. Huntingdon. ' Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, and Stamford. 1 Sax.

VIII with their adherents, withdrew into the forest of the Peak, where they con tinued for two years, living a predatory life.2 De Ferrars had his life spared, but was divested of the Earldom of Derby, with its large possessions, which were given to Edmund Earl of Lancaster, and eventually formed a considerable part of the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster. The only incidents deserving notice connected with Derbyshire, from this period till the commencement of the civil war in the 17th century, of which we have seen any mention, are, the imprisonment of John Duke of Bourbon for many years in Melbourne Castle, after the battle of Agincourt, and that of Mary Queen of Scots, who, during a captivity of 1 8 years, resided a con siderable part of the time in this county, under the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury.3 At the commencement of the civil war, immediately after King Charles had displayed his standard at Nottingham, his first march was to Derby. At this time (August, 1642), all Derbyshire, as Sir John Gell observes, declared for the King. He claims the merit of having been the first who appeared in arms in this county for the Parliament. Having before fought under the Earl of Essex, he went, in the month of October, 1642, to Hull, where he solicited and obtained the command of a regiment of foot, then consisting of 140 men, with which he marched into Derbyshire. Having on the 17th reached Chesterfield, he raised at that place 200 men by beat of drum ; thence he marched to Derby, where he raised a regiment of horse, and garrisoned the town. At this time, Lord Clarendon observes, there was, in Derbyshire, no visible party for the King ; the whole county being under the power of Sir John Gell. Winfield-manor was about this time made a garrison for the Parliament. Most of the particulars in the following brief account are taken from a narrative of the services performed by Sir John Gell, written by himself b, for the purpose of refuting, as it appears, certain charges brought against him after the Independents got into power. There is no doubt that Sir John Gell was an active useful officer in the service of the Parliament during almost the whole of the civil war : this Mrs. Hutchinson, in her Memoirs z Chron. Dunst. * She was some months at Winfield manor-house in 1 569, and again in 1584. In 1570, she was for some months at Chatworth ; and occasionally for a short time in succeeding years. She was allowed also to resort to Buxton four times, for her health, under the Earl's charge. By far the greatest part of her captivity was passed at Sheffield castle, a seat of the Earl of Shrews bury. b MS. in the possession of his descendant, Philip Gell, Esq., M.P., of Hopton-hall. of 9"], [27, "DERBYSHIRE. IX of her husband (a distinguished parliamentary officer of the Independent party), allows ; although she accuses him of being a great boaster, and of having sometimes claimed for himself the merit of services which had been performed by others. She accuses Whitelock also of having given Sir John Gell more than his due share of praise. The first service which Sir John Gell recounts in his Narrative, is the driving of Sir Francis Wortley and his forces from Wirksworth and the Peak, in November, 1642. Soon afterwards he took Bretby-house, which had been fortified by the Earl of Chesterfield. In the beginning of January following, he took Sir John Harpur's house at Swarkston, and Swarkston bridge, where he defeated a party of Royalists, in a skirmish, which is called, in the parish-register of All-Saints, in Derby, the battle of Swarkston bridge. Early in this year (1643), the Earl of Newcastle, who was commander-in chief of the King's forces in the northern and midland counties, placed a garrison in Bolsover Castle. In the month of April, Colonel Thomas Gell (brother of Sir John) took Sutton-house, which had been garrisoned by its owner, Lord Deincourt, after a short resistance. The Earl of Newcastle was with his army at Chesterfield, in May and in December, 1643 : at one of these periods, he is said to have been successful in an engagement with the Parliamentary forces. In the course of this year, Sir John Gell mentions that Sir Thomas Fairfax, then commander-in-chief for the Parliament, came to Derby, and stayed there three days, for the purpose of procuring a supply of men from the Der byshire garrisons : Sir John provided him with 400 from Chatsworth, Winfield, and Wingerworth. In the month of December, the Earl of Newcastle besieged Winfield manor-house, and took it in three days : the command was given to Colonel Molineux. Sir John Gell says, that after the Earl of Newcastle was gone, Colonel Milward quartered his regiment at Bakewell ; Colonel Eyre at Chatsworth, and his own house (Hassop) in the Peak ; Colonel Fitzherbert at South-Winfield and Tissington ; and Colonel Frecheville at his own house (Staveley). The Parliamentary forces, then at Ashborne, had a successful engagement close to that town, in the month of February 1 644, with the Royalists, who in consequence evacuated Tissington and Bakewell, and retired to Chats worth, Winfield, Staveley and Bolsover. In the month of March, there was an engagement at Egginton-heath, between the Royalists and the Par liamentarians. The latter were under the command of Captain Rodes and Major Molanus. Sir John Gell claims the victory for the Parliament. This Vol. V. b seems"], [28, "DERBYSHIRE. X seems to have been the same battle in which Heath says that the Royalists were victorious, relating the same circumstance which Sir John asserts of the Royalists, as having happened to the parliamentary forces ; that they were driven across the Dove, in which many were drowned. In the month of April, Sir John Gell and Lord Grey took the pass of Wilne-ferry, and demolished the works constructed by the Royalists on the Leicestershire side of the river. Soon after this, he commenced the siege of Winfield manor-house, then commanded by Colonel Dalby, applying for assistance to Colonel Hutchinson, the governor of Nottingham, .who sent him 200 men. The King sent General Hastings to its relief, but his troops were beaten by Sir John Gell ; and Major-General Crawford having arrived with reinforcements from the Earl of Manchester, they opened their batteries, and the garrison was taken after a bombardment of three hours. The governor was killed during the siege. Colonel Gell left two companies in the house, and marched to Derby. On his route to Winfield, General Crawford took Bolsover Castle and Staveley-house. In October, 1644, Colonel Gell garrisoned Barton-park, for the purpose of watching and annoying the King's garrison at Tutbury. Whilst the King was moving about with his reduced army (3000 horse), after the battle of Naseby, by quick marches, he passed from Bewdley into Derbyshire, and defeated Sir John Gell in some skirmishes at Sudbury and Ashborne, about the middle of August, 1645. From Ashborne, he marched through the Peak to Doncaster. About the latter end of September, 1645, the governor of Welbeck put a fresh garrison into Chatsworth, with 300 horse, under the command of Colonel Shallcross. Colonel Molanus being sent by Sir John Gell against the garrison, besieged it for fourteen days ; but on hearing of the demo lition of Welbeck, Bolsover, and Tickhill castles, was commanded by Colonel Gell to return to Derby. In the month of January 1646, orders were given for supplies for the garrison at Derby ; but that town and Winfield manor-house were dismantled not long afterwards. In 1659, there was an insurrection at Derby against Richard Cromwell. In the year 1745, Charles James Stuart, commonly called the young pre tender, having, in the prosecution of his rash enterprize, penetrated into the heart of the kingdom, entered Derby with his army on the fourth of December. His advanced guard secured the pass at Swarkston-bridge 5 but on the evening of the fifth he held a great council, at which, after a warm debate, it was determined, in consequence of the little encourage- 9 ment"], [29, "DE R B YS HfR^t. XI ment he had met with on his march, and the nearjapproach of the Duke of Cumberland with a superior force, to retreat immediately towards the North, a resolution which was carried into effect at an early hour the next morning. $. Division of the County, Ecclesiastical ttnd Civil. The civil subdivisions of Derbyshire, like those of most other northern counties, were anciently called wapentakes. In the Domesday Survey, we find mention of the wapentakes of Scarvedale, Hamestan, Morlestan, Walecross, and Apultre, and a district called Peche-fers a; but we \u00b0-ain no information from it, as to the extent of the several districts. The Hundred Roll, a record of the year 1273, speaks of the wapentakes of Peck, Scarvedale, Apeltre\", Repindon, Greselegh, Little-chirch, and Wyrkes worth. Other records speak of the hundreds of Risley and Sawley. This seems to have been the same district, and probably a part of the wapentake called in the Domesday Survey, Morlestan, and in the Hundred-Roll, Little chirch, now the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch. The Wirksworth division still retains the name of a wapentake ; the other modern divisions, Appletree, High-Peak, Scarsdale, Repton and Gresley, and Morleston and Litchurch are called hundreds. The hundred of Repton and Gresley, which seems to have been two wapentakes, in 1273, 's supposed to answer to the wapentake of Walecross, spoken of in the Domesday Survey ; and the Wapentake of Hamestan there mentioned, is supposed to have consisted chiefly of what is now the hundred of High- Peak. In the reign of Edward I., the wapentakes of Apeltre and Repiugton, which had belonged to the crown, were by the King's grant, vested in Edmund Earl of Lancaster/ The wapentake of Greselegh belonged to the heirs of the Earl of Chester d, and the wapentake of Scarvedale to Nicholas Lord Wake. The Lordship of this wapentake (now the hundred of Scarsdale) has always passed with that of Chesterfield, and is vested in his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, who is lessee under the Duchy of Lancaster of the hundred of the High-Peak. Peak-Forest. b In one part of the Roll called the hundred of Apeltre. c In one part of the Roll, it is said, the heirs of the Earl of Chester. \" In one part of the Roll, it is said to belong to the heirs of the Earl of Chester, and Edmund Earl of Lancaster, jointly. b 2 The"], [30, "DERBYSHIRE. XII The hundred of Appletree, of which Lord Vernon is lessee, has been held by the Vernon family on lease under the Duchy of Lancaster, ever since the year 1660. Richard Arkwright, Esq., M. P., is lessee of the wapentake of Wirksworth, under the Duchy. The Lordship of the hun dred of Repton and Gresley, which has long passed with the manor o( Repton, is vested in Sir Henry Crewe, Bart. The hundred of Morleston and Litchurch is in the crown. Derbyshire is an archdeaconry in the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, and is divided into six deaneries ; Alto Pecco or High-Peak, Ashbome, Castillar, Chesterfield, Derby, and Repington. Bakewell, Hope, Tideswell, and their chapelries, Chapel-en-le-Frith and Kniveton, are in the peculiar jurisdiction of the Dean and Chapter of Lich field ; Sawley and its chapelries are in the jurisdiction of the prebendary of that corps, in the church of Lichfield ; Calke, Dale- Abbey, and Hartington, with the chapel of Sterndale, and Peak-Forest chapel, are exempt from ecclesiastical jurisdiction. According to Wolsey's list, the number of parishes in this county, in the reign of Henry VIIL, was 106. Pilkington was very nearly correct in stating them at 116 in 1789 ; the number, as will be seen by the follow ing table, is 117. There are also forty-nine parochial, and three extra parochial chapels, in which the rites of baptism and sepulture are performed. Many of these have long been deemed, and are usually described as separate and distinct parishes ; there are thirteen chapels of other descriptions, and two extra-parochial chapels, in which the rites of baptism and sepulture are not performed. Fifty of the benefices in Derbyshire are rectories; fifty-eight vicarages, and nine donatives or perpetual curacies. Of the vicarages, donatives, &c. forty-seven were appropriated to religious houses ; five to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, three to the Dean of Lincoln, one (Kniveton) passed by exchange from the former to the latter, and was afterwards alienated to lay hands ; one (Tibshelf) was appropriated to the vicars-choral of Lichfield, two to the Bishop of Carlisle, one (Scropton) to a chantry in the parish church, and one (Longford) to the sine cure rector.

They had priories also at Repton and Gresley ; the former priory had a cell at Calke. Dale Abbey was originally inhabited by Austin canons ; these were soon suc ceeded by Premonstratensians, and it continued of that order till its disso lution : the Premonstratensians had also an abbey at Beauchief. A piece of ground at Ashborne was given for the erection of a cell for Cistertians belonging to Mireval Abbey, in Warwickshire'; but it does not appear that the intention was ever carried into effect.

The greater number of the estates of Henry de Ferrars, were parcelled out among his retainers, not long after the date-of this survey, by Henry de Ferrars, and his son Robert, the first Earl Ferrars. Among those who had grants from the former, we find the ancestor of the Fitzherberts, who still possess the estates then granted. The manors which were retained by the Ferrars family in their own hands, were forfeited by Robert, Earl of Derby, in the reign of , Henry III., and became parcel of the duchy of Lancaster. Ralph Fitzhubert was ancestor of the Frechevilles, who continued to possess estates in Derbyshire till the extinction of the family in the reign of Charles II. The estates of Walter Deincourt continued in his descendants till they became divided between coheiresses in the reign of Henry VI. The estates of the Barons Musard passed to coheiresses in the reign of Edward II. ; a marriage with one of them increased the landed property of the Frechevilles. The estates of William Peverel, Geoffry Alselin (the heiress of whose family married Bardolf ), Ralph de Burun and Roger Busli, passed out of those families at an early period. Among the possessors of considerable landed property in the reign of Henry II. we find only the Shirleys and Curzons who retain any part of it at the present day. Among the larger landed proprietors of later date, may be mentioned the Vernons of Haddon, whose estates have passed by inheritance to the Duke of Rutland ; the Longfords and Leakes, whose estates have been dispersed ; the Montgomerys, whose estates passed by inheritance to Lord Vernon's ancestors, and the representatives of the other coheiress ; the Stanhopes, whose estates are now held by the three noble families of that name ; the Talbots, and Cavendishes. The estates of Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, in Derbyshire have been partly divided among coheiresses, and have partly passed by gift of Eliza beth, Countess of Shrewsbury, to the family of Sir William Cavendish, her husband. These estates, with numerous grants of abbey lands, have passed to his descendant, the Duke of Devonshire, who has by far the largest landed property in the county, and is lessee, under the crown, of the greater portion of the ancient Ferrars estate, which was annexed to the duchy of Lancaster.

The noble family of Howard became possessed of the manor of Glossop, in this county, by marriage with one of the coheiresses of Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury.

Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire. \u2014 Sir William Cavendish, descended from an ancient family who took their name from Cavendish in Suffolk1, the place of their residence, settled in Derbyshire in consequence of his mar riage with the heiress of Hardwick, about the year 1544; by which match he became possessed of Hardwick-hall, and other estates. Having been an active and useful instrument in the business of the Reformation, he obtained several grants of manors and lands in this county, which had belonged to reli gious houses ; was raised to the dignity of a Privy-counsellor, and appointed by King Henry VIII. to the office of Treasurer of the Chamber. In the reign of Edward VI. he purchased Chatsworth, ever since one of the principal seats of his noble descendants, of the family of Agard, and began to build on the site of the old hall a mansion, which was finished by his widow. This lady, more celebrated as the Countess of Shrewsbury, built a new mansion at Hardwick, which appears to have been the chief seat of Sir William Caven dish, their elder son : this Sir William was created Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick, in 1605, and in 161 8, Earl of Devonshire.

Upon the death of George, seventh Earl of Rutland, in 1641, the elder branch of that noble family having be come extinct, John Manners of Nether-Haddon, grandson of Sir John above mentioned, succeeded to the title, and Haddon-hall became, for some time, one of the principal seats of the Earls of Rutland, as it was of the first Duke, who was raised to that dignity in 1703: it is now the property of his Grace, John Henry, the present Duke, but has not been for many years inhabited by the family. The first Duke of Rutland, during the life of his father, John, eighth Earl of Rutland, was summoned to par liament by writ, as Baron Manners of Haddon.

Sir Thomas Stanhope, son of Sir Michael, became possessed of considerable estates in Derbyshire, in consequence of his marriage with the coheiress of Sir John Port, who was one of the re presentatives of the Montgomerys of Cubley ; and in the year 1585, he pur chased the manor and park of Bretby, now the principal seat of this noble family. Philip, the grandson of Sir Michael, was created, in 161 6, Baron Stanhope of Shelford, and in 1628, Earl of Chesterfield.

The said Elizabeth Shirley was also, through her mother who was daughter of Sir Humphrey Ferrers, of Walton-on-Trent in Derbyshire, and grand-daughter and heiress of Sir John Ferrers of Tam worth, the representative of the other great branch of the ancient family of Ferrers or Ferrars, that of Groby and Tamworth. g 2 Stanhope,"], [70, "DERBYSHIRE.

Robert, the succeed ing and fifth Earl of Derby, was dispossessed of his estates, and deprived of his Earldom, for his repeated acts of rebellion, in the reign of Henry III. : he died in 1278. His descendants enjoyed the title of Lord Ferrars, of Chartley, but had no longer any connection with this county. The last Lord Ferrars, of Chartley, died in or about the year 1449. His daughter and heiress married Sir Walter Devereux ; and the barony, having passed through the families of Shirley and Compton, is now enjoyed by Marquis Townshend. The Earls of Derby had a castle at Duffield. After the title of Earl of Derby had been taken from the Ferrars family, it was given, with that of Lancaster, to several of the blood-royal of the Plantagenets. Melbourne Castle was one of the seats of Edmund, Earl of Lancaster. King Henry VII. conferred the title of Earl of Derby on the Stanley family, in whom it has ever since continued.

In tymes past, the Castle of the Peake, for the honour of Peverell ; Codnor, for the Lord Grey ; Elvaston, for the family of Blount, Lord Mountjoye ; the Earls of Shrewsbury at Buttons E j and Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, at Chatsworth.\"11 The present noblemen's seats are, Chatsworth, the chief seat, and Hard wick, an occasional residence, of the Duke of Devonshire ; Elvaston, the seat of the Earl of Harrington ; Sudbury, of Lord Vernon ; and Kedleston, of Lord Scarsdale. Bretby, the seat of the Chesterfield family, is shut up, during the minority of the present Earl. Haddon and Bolsover, belonging to the Dukes of Rutland and Portland, although the buildings are kept up, have many years ceased to be inhabited by those noble families. The Duke of Rutland has lately fitted up a Hall on the banks of the Derwent, in the parish of Youlgrave, called Stanton- Woodhouse, for the purpose of an occasional residence during the shooting-season. Sutton is a seat of the Marquis of Ormond, of the kingdom of Ireland, in right of his wife. Do veridge is the seat of Lord Waterpark, of the kingdom of Ireland ; Hassop of the Earl of Newburgh, of the kingdom of Scotland. The only remains of ancient seats of the nobility are those of Codnor Castle, formerly belonging to the Lords Grey, and Winfield manor-house, the seat of the Earl of Shrewsbury. * It seems probable, that this was a name sometimes given to South- Winfield manor-house, of which Mr. Kinder makes no mention ; yet it had been inhabited by the Shrewsbury family not many years before his time.

It appears by record, that this Nicholas was living in 1365. He had four sons. There is no account of the posterity of the two elder in the Visitations. Ralph Eyre, of Offerton in Hope, buried at Hathersage in 1493, was> probably, the son of one of them. Robert Eyre, third son of Nicholas, married the heiress of Padley, of Padley in Hathersage, by whom he had eleven sons. Robert, the eldest, settled at Padley. Sir Anthony, his great-grandson, was thrice married and had several children, but left only one surviving daughter and heiress, who marrried Sir Thomas Fitzherbert, of Norbury. Thomas, grandson of Robert Eyre, by the heiress of Padley, being the next brother of Robert, son of Robert, settled at Highlow in Hope. The immediate male representative of this Thomas, and, in consequence, of the elder branch of Eyre of Padley, and most probably also, of the original Eyres of Hope, is Philip Gell, Esq. M.P. of Hopton, whose grandfather took the name of Gell as before mentioned. One of the younger sons q of Robert Eyre, by the heiress of Padley, was of Holme-hall in the parish of Chesterfield ; he married the heiress of Whittington, who was heiress also of Bakewell. Edward Eyre, grandson of this marriage, had two wives : from the first is descended Anthony Eyre, Esq., of the Grove in Nottinghamshire, many years one of the members for that county. Thomas Eyre, son of the second wife, settled at Holme-hall, and his descendants were afterwards of Newbold and of Dronfield-Woodhouse. The immediate representative of this branch is Edward Eyre, Esg., now of the Upper Crescent in Bath.

This branch is extinct : the heiress married Tatton, and afterwards Radcliffe. Thomas *> Called in the Visitation Robert, and described as the fourth son, the elder being Robert also.

Lord Teignmouth is the immediate descendant and repre sentative of Sir John Shore. It is probable that the Shores of Sheffield were, as they claim to be, descended from the same family.

Two branches of this family were for many generations settled at Riber and Allen-hill, in Matlock. The Riber branch became extinct by the death of Anthony Wolley, Esq., in 1668.

Forests and Deer-Parks. The King's forest of the Peak was of great extent. That in ancient times it was much infested with wolves is evident. A family of the here ditary name of Wolfhunt held lands by the service of keeping the forest clear of those destructive animals. It seems that they had ceased to be inhabitants of the forest before the reign of Edward II. ; for a record of that period states, that John le Wolfhunt, son of John le Wolfhunt, held certain lands by the service of taking and destroying all wolves that should come into His Majesty's forest of the Peak. The Peak-forest is spoken of as plentifully stocked with deer in the year 1634 s : it is probable that they were destroyed in the civil war. Belper-park, belonging to the duchy of Lancaster, was kept up as a park in the early part of the seventeenth century. There were anciently six other parks in and near Duffield, belonging to the Earls of Lancaster. Besides these there were, in the early part of the fourteenth century, not less than fifty-four deer-parks in Derbyshire, belonging to monastic bodies and individuals s, as may be seen in the following table.

Boundaries, Extent, <3\u00a7t. \u2014 Derbyshire is an inland county, lying nearly in the centre of England. It is bounded on the east by Nottinghamshire and part of Leicestershire ; a part of which county forms also its southern boundary : on the west it is bounded by Staffordshire and Cheshire, and on the north by Yorkshire. Its greatest length from south-south-east to north north-west, is about 56 miles and a half; from east-north-east to west south-west, 33 miles. It contains, according to Mr. Farey's estimation, 972 square English miles, and 622,080 statute acres. The southern and middle district is for the most part in culture.' In the hundreds of Scarsdale and the Peak is the great East Moor u, a considerable part of which remains 1 In Farey's Agricultural Survey, vol. i. is an account of about 22,500 acres of common, inclosed since about the middle of the last century. u It extends northward from Ashover and Darley, through the parish of Bakewell and its chapelries, almost to the boundaries of the county. 1 2 waste,"], [189, "DERBYSHIRE. clxxi waste. In the northern part of the Peak, bordering on Yorkshire, are most extensive sheepwalks, called the Woodlands, in the parishes of Hope and Glossop, without any walls or fences to divide the different manors, parishes, or counties. x Soils and Strata. \u2014 The soils of Derbyshire consist chiefly of clay, loam, sand, and peat, very irregularly intermixed : the southern part, which has been distinguished by the appellation of the fertile district, consists princi pally of a red loam on various subsoils, which approaches nearer to marl, clay, loam, sand, grit, or gravel, according to the nature of the substratum or its exposure to the atmosphere. Peat mosses are abundant in the northern part of the county, denominated the High-Peak.y The substrata of the southern part of the county, comprised within a line drawn east and west from Sandiacre to Ashborne, consists of gravel, intermixed with large portions of red marl, of very irregular forms ; in several parts of which are beds of gypsum of considerable extent.2 The gravel is said by Mr. Farey to occupy an extent of nearly 77,000 acres, and the red marl of 81,000. The substrata of the other parts of Derbyshire consist of limestone of various kinds and toadstone ; shale and gritstone ; coal and indurated clay, resting on each other in the order here named ; but all appearing on the surface in certain parts of the county in consequence of their dipping in various directions. The lowermost of these is a stratum of limestone, the thickness of which has not been ascertained : it occupies a narrow space on the western side of the county, extending southerly from the moun tain called Mam-tor, to Hopton and Parwich, and nearly to Thorp ; and contains 40,500 acres.1 This stratum of limestone abounds in ca verns, several of which are of great extent : the most remarkable are, the Devil's-hall, in Foreside-mine at Castleton, connected by a tunnel with Speedwell-mine ; Pool's-hole, near Buxton ; Reynard's hall and cave, * To obviate the inconveniences arising from the mixture of flocks, a shepherds' society has huen established at Hayficld; the orders of which have been printed, with the marks of the several sheep-owners accurately described. 1 Detailed accounts of the soil and strata of Derbyshire, may be found in Pilkington's Derbyshire, vol. i. White Watson's Delineation of the Strata of Derbyshire, Mawe's Mi neralogy and Geology of Derbyshire, and in Farey's General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire, vol. i. 1 The beds of gypsum are from two to four yards in thickness; the most considerable are at Chellaston, Aston, and Elvaston. \u2014 Pilkington, vol.i. p. 94.

Some of these are also called swallow-holes, from streams of water falling into, and being lost in them. The sides of many of the caverns are covered with stalactitical incrustations, and subterranean streams are found running through several of them. Immediately over the stratum of limestone above-mentioned, are three others of limestone and three of toadstone, in alternate layers, occupying nearly 51,500 acres of the surface1*, extending north and south from Cas tleton to Hopton ; eastward to Matlock, Youlgrave, Bakewell, and Stony- Middleton ; and westward to Wormhill and Chelmorton. The limestone is the true metalliferous rock of Derbyshire, and occupies, exclusively, the attention of the miner. There are few situations in the Peak, where this rock does not abound in veins of lead ore or calamine; these, which are here called rake-veins, have, for the most part, an easterly and westerly direction, although, in the wapentake of Wirksworth, they have as often a northerly and southerly one. They are intersected by other veins which do not contain lead ore, and are called cross-veins. Ores of lead too and cala mine are found in what are here termed pipe-works and flat-works, which run horizontally, whereas the rake-veins are more or less perpendicular. It has been already noticed, that strata of toadstone alternate with those of limestone, in many parts of the mineral district. It was long reported and believed, that the veins were wholly cut off by the former (although they were constantly found again in the limestone below); but this is erroneous, for although it be true, that the lead ore seldom continues through the toadstone, yet there is always a leader of spar which indicates the direction of the vein. When the miner says the vein is thus cut off; he b Elden-hole, which lies about two miles and a half south-west of Castleton, one of the seven wonders of the Peak, and formerly supposed to be of unfathomable depth, was ascer tained by the late John Lloyd, Esq., F.R.S., who descended into it in the year 1770, to be a shaft of about 62 yards in depth, at the bottom of which are two caverns ; one of them being small, the other about 50 yards in diameter and of great height, (being a vast dome of the form of the inside of a glass-house,) communicating with each other. In the greater cavern, it is said that there was formerly another shaft, having at the bottom of it a stream of waters supposed to communicate with that running through the great cavern at' Castleton. A par ticular account of Elden-hole, and these caverns, was communicated by Mr. Lloyd to the Royal Society, and published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxi. p. 250. c A list of them is given in Farey's View, v,oL i. p. 292., and of the swallow holes, p. 2Qc. d Farey's View, p. 280. means"], [191, ""], [192, ""], [193, ""], [194, ""], [195, "DERBYSHIRE. clxxiii means only that the lead ore no longer continues through the toadstone. The vein is not unfrequently started or thrown on one side by a subsidence of the strata, where the two rocks meet, in which case, however, it is found again to the right or the left, and invariably continues in the same direction as before. Besides these accidents, the veins are often borne away for the space of* a few feet, by those which intersect them. The phenomena, therefore, of mineral veins in Derbyshire are much the same as those of other mining countries ; but the pipe-works aud flat-works are very rarely to be met with elsewhere. The several strata of limestone are also very abundant in corrallines, shells, and various other organic remains/ In several parts of this district, the lime stone is of so compact a quality as to be used as marble ; particularly at Ashford, where it is black, and at Monyash, where it is of a mottled-grey colour ; and abounding with entrochi and their fragments. The strata of toadstone vary considerably in thickness, and in some places in number, never exceeding three, and sometimes being only two, or a single stratum. Mr. Whitehurst, in his \" Inquiry into the original' State and Formation of the Earth,\" has given the following as the thicknesses of the six alter nate strata of limestone and toadstone, in a section between Grange-mill and Darley-moor : \u2014 The first or uppermost limestone, 50 yards ; the first toadstone, 16 yards; the second limestone, 50 yards; the second toad stone, 46 yards; the third limestone, 60 yards; the third toadstone, 22 yards. Between these six strata are six other very thin ones of clay, denominated way-boards. There are detached portions of the alternate strata of limestone and toadstone in several parts of the county f, but of no great extent. The strata which come next in succession above those of limestone and toadstone are, millstone grit, and shale ; the former being 120 yards thickE, and resting on the latter, which is of equal, if not greater thickness. The limestone district above-mentioned is surrounded by that of gritstone, as it is called ; though in several parts the gritstone is wanting, the shale only appearing. There are many detached patches of this grit-rock, under which on all sides the shale is apparent, both in the gritstone district and also in that of limestone\"; and within this extensive stratum of shale are included several masses of dark blue or black limestone : one of them, im mediately north of Fenny-Bentley, is of considerable extent, as is another south-west of Ashford and north-west of Bakewell.' e See the head of Fossils, p. clxxxv. f A list of these is given in Farey's View, vol. i. p. 241. z Whitehurst makes it 120 yards thick; Farey from 150 to 170 yards.

One of these, very finely grained and hard, is called cank-stone; another, deno minated crowstone\u201eis also very hard, and of a compact composition : chert, or hornstone, frequently occurs in the strata of limestone. ' That portion of Derbyshire in which the gritstone and shale strata ap pear, contains 160,500 acres.1 The coal strata, or coal-measures as they are usually termed, occupy a large portion of the county on the eastern side, bounded by a part of Yorkshire on the north ; on the west they extend nearly to Chatsworth, Darley, Crich, and Duffield ; on the south to Dale- Abbey, and nearly to Sandiacre. The seams of coal are of various degrees of thickness, and are separated by numerous strata of gritstone and argillaceous strata, known by the names of bind, chinch, and shale. The immediate floor of each coal seam is clay, in some degree of induration, or the crow-stone above-men tioned.1\" Beds of iron-stone are found in several of the coal-shales ; and a great abundance and variety of impressions of ferns and other vege tables. Part of the coal-field, about the middle of which lies Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, extends into the county of Derby, near its southern ex tremity, in the parishes of Hartshorn, Gresley, and Measham ; surrounded by the stratum of red marl, to which it dips in every direction.\" There is also a stratum of coal of small extent at Combe-moss, nearly north of Buxton, and at Chinley-hills, near Chapel-en-le-Frith. Mr. Farey computes the whole of the coal-measures of Derbyshire at 1 90,000 acres.0 On the eastern side of the county, above the coal-measures, is a stratum of yellow magnesian limestone, extending north and south, from Barlborough to Hardwick ; and bounded on the west by Barlborough, Bolsover, and Hault-Hucknall ; occupying about 21,600 acres.p In several parts of Derbyshire, more especially in the coal district, the strata are broken and dislocated in various directions : these dislocations k A particular account of them is given in Mr. W.

The three highest points in the mountainous tract of Derbyshire are, Ax-edge, about three miles south west of Buxton ; Lord's-Seat, near Castleton ; and Kinderscout, near the north-western extremity of the county/ Some of the valleys in the mountainous part of Derbyshire are very beau tiful, particularly those of Castleton and Glossop ; but what constitutes the most picturesque and singular scenery of this county, is the great number and variety of smaller valleys, or dales, with which the limestone district abounds. These may differ in extent, and some particular circumstances, but the general characteristics of all of them are, precipitous rocks, of very singular and picturesque forms, with mountain streams and rivulets running through the lower parts of the dales, which arc frequently well wooded; The most celebrated of them are, Matlock-Dale, on the river Derwent ; Monsal-Dale, the upper part of which is called Millers-Dale, and through which the river Wye runs ; Middleton-Dale, Eyam-Dale, and Dove-Dale. The first of these is the most extensive, and has been much celebrated for the beauty and variety of its scenery. The most striking object of Matlock-Dale is the stupendous rock called the High-Tor, rising almost perpendicularly from the river to the height of above 300 feet.5 q Detailed accounts of them are given by Mr. Farey in his View of the Agriculture, &c. of Derbyshire, vol. i. p. 165, 281, &c.

The most remarkable of these groups of gritstone rock are, those on Stanton-Moor, called Robin hood's stride, or Mock-beggar hall, and llowtor rocks. Rivers. \u2014 The chief rivers of Derbyshire are, the Trent, the Derwent, the Wye, the Dove, the Erwash, and the Rother. The Trent is one of the chief rivers of the kingdom ; and though it does not intersect the whole of it, is considered as the boundary of the two great divisions of north and south. It first becomes a boundary between Derby shire and Staffordshire in the parish of Croxall, between that village and the township of Catton, which is on its banks. It passes close to Drakelow, Walton, Stapenhill, and Newton-Solney, a little beyond which village it enters the county, which it separates from east to west in a course of about 24 miles, passing between Willington and Repton, by Twyford and Barrow, between Swarkston and Stanton, by Weston, Shardlow, and Sawley. It leaves the county about a mile and a half east from Long-Eaton, at its junc tion with the Erwash. There arejbridges over the Trent at Burton5, Swark ston, Sawley, and near Wilne. The latter, called Cavendish-bridge, was erected about the middle of the last century, by the Cavendish family; before which time there was a ferry at that place. The bridge at Sawley, called Har rington-bridge, was completed in 1790. There are ferries at Willington and Twyford ; the former for carriages. The river is fordable in two places at Twyford. The river Trent was made navigable, pursuant to an act of parlia ment procured in the year 1699, by the Earl of Uxbridge, up to Burton bridge'; but in the year 1805 the navigation from that bridge to Shardlow was given up by agreement with the proprietors of the Trent and Mersey canal, which runs by its side ; and it is navigable (as connected with Der byshire) only from Shardlow to the mouth of the Erwash. The Derwent which seems to take its name from a village in the Hi\u00b0*h- Peak, rises on the moors at the northern extremity of the county, near the junction of Cheshire and Yorkshire. Before it reaches Derwent it is called the Wrongesley. For a few miles this stream forms the boundary of Derby shire and Yorkshire.

Between Brough and Hathersage it receives the river Now, which rising on the hills above Edale, passes by Hope and Brough, and falls into the Der went at Malham-bridge in Hathersage. The Derwent then passes through some beautiful valleys, between Learn and Over-Padley, to Grindlefbrd bridge, by Stoke-hall and Froggatt, between Calver and Corbar, to Baslow ; thence through Chatsworth-park, near Beeley, to Rowsley ; thence through Darley-dale, and near Darley village, to Matlock, wherd it contributes to the beauties of its romantic scenery ; from Matlock, by Cromfbrd, to Hotstandwell-bridge ; thence, under Crich common, to Belper, Makeny, and Millfbrd ; between Holbrook and Duffield ; between Alles trey and Breadsall, by Darley and Little-Chester, to Derby, where is a bridge over it. From Derby it pursues a winding course, passing near Am baston and Draycote, between Great and Little- Wilne, to its conflux with the Trent, about a mile beyond the former. The whole of the Derwent is said to be about 46 miles. The Derwent was formerly navigable from Wilne-ferry up to Derby ; but the navigation was given up when the Derby canals were completed in 1794. The fiver Wye rises a little above Buxton, passing between Buxton and Fairfield, near King's-Sterndale, near Wormhill, through Monsall-xlale and Milieu-dale, near Little-Longsdon, through Ashford and Bakewell, and skirting Haddon-park, falls into the Derwent near Rowsley. The Dove, which has its source in the High-Peak, a few miles south of Buxton, is for many miles the boundary between Derbyshire and Stafford shire, passing near Church-Sterudale, Harrington, Thorp, (near which it forms an interesting feature of the romantic valley called Dovedale,) Map pleton, Norbury, and Doveridge, Sudbury, Scropton, Marston-on-Dove, and Egginton, \u2014 it falls into the Derwent near Newton-Solney. None of the above-mentioned places are above a mile from the river, some of them on its banks. The river Rot/ter which has its soiuce near Padley, runs near North- Winfield-church, to Chesterfield ; thence between Brimington and Whit tinp-fon, near Staveley and Renishaw. It leaves the county, and enters Yorkshire, between Killamarsh and Beighton. The Erwash, which is said by Pilkington to rise in the hundred of Scarsdale, but which appears by Burdett's map to rise on the skirts of Shirewood-fbrest in Nottinghamshire, is during the greater part of its. course a boundary between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

At But terley is a tunnel, about 57 yards below the Derwent ridge, 2978 yards in length, and nine feet wide. To the north-east of Wigwell, the canal is carried over the river Derwent, on a large aqueduct-bridge, 200 yards long and 30 feet high, built in 1792 : the span of the arch over the river is 80 feet. Over the Amber, at Bull-bridge, is another aqueduct of the same length, 50 feet in height. The two aqueducts are said to have cost 6000I. The river Derwent was many years ago made navigable from the Trent, at Wilden-ferry, to Derby ; but when the Derby canal was completed, in 1794', the proprietors of that canal having purchased the interest of those who were concerned in the Derwent navigation, it was from that time dis continued. The line of the Derby canal is wholly in this county, com mencing in the Trent and Mersey canal, north of Swarkston, passing by Derby, with branches to Little-Eaton and the collieries in Bootle-vale and Denby ; and terminating in the Erwash canal, half a mile south of Sandi acre. Its chief object is the supply of Derby with coals, building-stone, gypsum, and other articles, and the exportation of coals, manufactured goods, cheese, &c.

There are several manufactories on its banks at Derby, and iron-mills at Burrow-ash. This canal is 44 feet wide. Mr. Benjamin Outram was the engineer. The Nutbrook canal was made in or about 1793 u, for the exportation of coals and the importation of lime-stone ; it commences in the Erwash canal and terminates at Shipley wharf.

Fossils and Minerals. \u2014 The mineral productions of Derbyshire are various and abundant, especially in the limestone strata, where lead ore is found in several forms, but most commonly in that of Galena or sulphuret of lead ; that kind called slickenside, having a smooth glossy surface, is 7 found"], [213, "DERBYSHIRE. clxxxv found in the Odin mine near Castleton. A white lead ore, being a car bonate of lead, occurs in several mines ; and green and yellow ores are found in some, though rarely.4 A small portion of silver is frequently united with the lead, but not sufficient to be worth separating from it. Copper ore has been found in small quantities in some of the Derbyshire mines.\" The Ecton mine, though frequently spoken of as connected with this county, is within the borders of Staffordshire. The coal district produces iron ore in great abundance, both in nodules and laminae, particularly in Morley-park, and at Wingerworth, Chesterfield, and Stavely.c The lapis calaminaris, or oxyd of zinc ; the blende, black-jack, or sul phuret of zinc ; and the ore of manganese, here called black-wad, are found in several of the lead mines ; and pyrites in various forms in most of them. The ores of arsenic and antimony sometimes appear in small quantities, united with the lead ore. Quartz crystals ; various crystals of calcareous spar ; and of fluor or fluate of lime ; gypsum ; selenite ; barytes, here called cauk ; steatite and sulphur, are among the fossil productions of this county : of these, the most admired is the fluor known by the appellation of Blue-John, or Derbyshire spar, found in the fissures of the limestone, particularly in the neighbourhood of Castleton c ; this substance, when polished, exhibits an infinite variety of shades of blue, purple, red, and yellow. Its pecu liar beauty arises from a certain degree of transparency, which shews off these colours to advantage, and in the colours being striated in a direction contrary to the radii of the crystals, which compose the mass. Petroleum, or rock-oil, being bitumen in a liquid state, is found in the black marble at Ashford ; anil formerly in great abundance in the lime stone at Stony-Middleton. Elastic bitumen, a substance peculiar to this county, much resembling in appearance the caoutchouc, or Indian rubber, is found in the cavities of the Odin mine. The coal, which abounds in this county in the parts already mentioned, is of several kinds, hard and soft, both of which burn to a white ash, and caking or crozling, as it is called, which usually burns to a red ash/ The limestone of Derbyshire is of various colours, white, grey, yellow, blue, and black ; and of various qualities, some being i oft, and some suffi- a Farey, vol.i. p. 355. \"Ib. p. 252. c Pilkington. vol. i. p. 132. * See an account of the stuor mine in Mawe's Mineralogy of Derbyshire, p. 69, f Farey, vol. i. p. 187.

Few counties produce a greater number or variety of extraneous fossils than Derbyshire ; the several strata of limestone, and some of gritstone, in this county, containing organic remains, both animal and vegetable, in great abundance. Impressions of the leaves of plants, chiefly of the fern kind, are found in great abundance, in the nodules of iron-stone ; and various other vegetable remains in the several strata of gritstone, and the iron-stone in the coal district.\" One of the most remarkable, and of most frequent occurrence, is the fragment of a trunk or stem of some vegetable, some times nearly a yard in length, and 12 or 13 inches in circumference, thickly beset, in quincunx order, with holes, from the bottom of which rise small papillae, and frequently inclosing a substance with a rough imbricated surface about one-sixteenth of its own thickness0, passing through it p like a pith. The stem is sometimes surrounded with numerous slender lanceolate leaves proceeding from the papillae.

Natural History of Derbyshire, in speaking of rare birds, mentions \" the siccasand, a long slender bird, something ruddie, the water-ousel, and the Granby crow.\" Pilkington mentions the hooded, or Royston crow, as sometimes seen, but not very common in Der byshire ; he speaks of the eagle as only occasionally seen for more than a century past : Willoughby says, that an eagle's nest was found in the Peak, near the Derwent, in 1668. Pilkington describes a great variety of falcons, which have been found in Derbyshire ; but it does not appear that there is any evidence of the rarer sorts having bred in the county. There are black game in the Peak : ruffs and reeves are said to have formerly frequented Synfin-moor. Among the rarer birds of passage, Pilkington enumerates, the ring and rose-coloured ouzel, the Bohemian chatterer, and several water-fowl occasionally shot on the Derwent. A singular circumstance, connected with ornithology, has occurred in the parish of Ashover ; on the cliff adjoining Overton-park is a rock, called as long as any person living can recollect, Raven's-Nest Torr ; two ravens have con stantly built their nest in this rock, and although it is taken every year, an apparatus having been fixed for many years to the rock for that purpose, yet the ravens constantly build in the same place. Warm, Mineral, and other remarkable Springs. \u2014 The most noted warm, or rather tepid springs, in Derbyshire, are those at Buxton and Matlock. The tepid springs at Buxton are numerous ; the heat is uniformly 820, in all seasons and circumstances. The water is remarkably pure, being very slightly impregnated with saline particles.1 It is used both for bathing and internally, being chiefly recommended for gout, rheumatism, derange ment of the biliary and digestive organs, and diseases of the urinary pas sages, for all of which it is in considerable repute. There are separate public baths for gentlemen, ladies, and the poor, and two private baths. The average number of visitors in the bathing season is computed at 700. These springs have been resorted to for medicinal purposes from the time of the Romans/ * The result of Dr. Pearson's analysis was, that 15 grains of residuum, yielded by a gallon of water, contained \\\\ grains of muriate of soda, z\\ sulphate of lime, and 10} carbonate of lime, held in solution by a slight excess of carbonic acid. b See more of the history of Buxton and its waters in the Parochial History. The 1 1"], [218, "DERBYSHIRE. CXC The tepid springs at Matlock, which are three in number, are of much lower temperature than those at Buxton, the thermometer not rising higher in the bath than 68\u00b0. The water is extremely pure, and even less im pregnated with mineral substances than that of Buxton. It does not appear that any actual analysis has been made of it. Dr. Percival observes, that it much resembles the Bristol water, both in chemical and medicinal qualities ; and like that is recommended in hectic complaints, diabetes, &c. Matlock has probably more visitors in the course of the year than Buxton ; but the greater number of them come chiefly for the sake of amusement, and to admire the beauties of its scenery/ There are baths at Matlock, of which further mention is made in the parochial account. There is no doubt that the waters at Bakewell were known to the Romans : the Saxon name, Bathecanwell, is taken from the baths. The temperature of the tepid chalybeate spring at Bakewell does not exceed 59 or 60 degrees. This water, which has been lately analysed by Mr. C. Sylvester, of Derby\", is recommended as a tonic, (not being found to produce heat,) for indi gestion, debility, and all complaints arising from an inactive state of the lymphatic vessels. As a bath it is recommended for chronic rheumatism. A large bath, erected over this spring about the year 1697, has lately been put into thorough repair. It is 17 feet high, 33 feet long, and 20 wide. Over the bath is a news and reading-room of the same length. At Bake well also is a spring which has been found to contain in 60 quarts 1 3 cubic c It was not till about the year 1730 that there were any accommodations for visitors at Mat lock-bath. Previously to that time there was no road through the valley, and the roads approach ing to it are spoken of as abounding in danger. Defoe, in his Tour through England, published a few years before, says, \" This bath would be much more frequented than it is, if a sad stony mountainous road which leads to it, and no good accommodation when you are there, did not hinder ; for from the bath you are to cross over the meadows, and then ascend a Derbyshire hill, before you meet with a house of refreshment. For some miles before you come to Mat lock, you pass over barren moors, in perpetual danger of slipping into coal-pits and lead-mines, or ride for miles together on the edge of a steep hill, on solid slippery rock or loose stones with a valley underneath, the bottom of which you can hardly discover with your eye.\" d It was found to contain, in ten wine-quarts of water, Grains.

CXCI inches of sulphurated hydrogen. A complete analysis of it has not yet been made.e Its temperature is that of common water : it is supposed to be of about the same strength as the sulphureous spring at Kedleston, and useful in the same complaints. The water in the tepid spring at Stony-Middleton much resembles that of Matlock, but is not so warm, being of only 63 degrees. The bath, which is open to the air is little frequented. There are tepid springs also at Stoke in Stony-Middleton, Brough near Hope, and at Cromford. There was formerly also a tepid spring and a bath at Middleton in Wirksworth, but the water has been entirely lost. The only sulphureous spring which of late ye^rs has been much in use is that at Kedleston : it is used externally for most cutaneous diseases, parti cularly those of an ulcerous nature ; taken internally it is chiefly recom mended as an antiscorbutic and diuretic. There is a convenient bath at this spring. Other sulphureous springs are at Agnes and Mudge meadows (three miles from Ashborne, on the road to Wirksworth); Bakewell (as be fore-mentioned); Bradwell ; Brassington ; Cowley, near Dionfield ; Knive ton; Milhngton-green, near Kirk-Ireton ; Shottle, in Duffield; Shuttle wood, near Bolsover; West-Hallam; Whittington ; and near Wirksworth town/ At Cowley and Shuttlewood there are open baths, which are but little used; that at Shuttlewood is not even inclosed by a wall. The most celebrated chalybeate water is that at Quarndon, two miles from Derby, and half a mile from the sulphureous spring at Kedleston. It is a good deal frequented in the summer season, and particularly recommended to persons of a weak and relaxed habit. There is a chalybeate spring at Buxton, much resembling that at Quarndon. Other chalybeate springs are at Ashover; Bakewell (the tepid spring already mentioned); Birly, in Eckington (where was formerly an open bath); Bradley; Chesterfield; two at Duffield ; Eccleston, in Youlgrave ; Hope ; Matlock ; Moilev-park ; Shottle ; Stanley ; Tibshelf (much frequented a century ago) ; and Whit tington. Mr. Farey enumerates Heage among the chalybeate springs: Pilkington calls this a martial vitriolic spring ; and says, that it stops inward bleeding, and is good in ulcerous disorders. Mr. Pilkington says, that he had heard of only one salt spring in Derby- e Mr. Carrington, a surgeon at Bakewell, is preparing for the press an account of this and other mineral waters at and near Bakewell. f Farey and Pilkington. shire,"], [220, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCII shire, which was in the Peak, between Hope and Bradwell. Mr. Farey mentions this and another at Donisthorpe, near Measham. All authors who have written on the springs of Derbyshire mention the intermitting spring in the Peak, about half a mile from Sparrow-pit, called Barmoor ebbing and flowing well. The intermission is not regular, and in dry seasons the ebbing and flowing sometimes ceases for several weeks. In wet seasons, the interval between ebbing and flowing is about five mi nutes. When we visited it, the season was rather dry, and we could ob serve no motion in it during the space of half an hour. Tideswell took its name from a spring of this nature, which has long ceased to flow5: the site of the well is scarcely known, Produce. Kinder calls Aston, Weston, Elvaston, &c, the granary of Derby shire ; and says, that within six miles in that part of the shire, more corn was grown than in the whole county beside. Great quantities of excellent wheat and of barley are now grown both in the southern and the eastern part of the county. The arable land in the Peak is chiefly cul tivated for oats, of which grain there is a great home consumption, oaten bread being still, as it hath long been, the chief food of the poorer classes. When there is an average crop, there is more corn of every sort grown than is consumed in the county. Pilkington says, that in 1789, they ex ported 5000 quarters of barley annually to Staffordshire and Lancashire, besides what was sold at the markets of Burton and Uttoxeter. The principal dairy country is in the neighbourhood of Ashborne. About 2000 tons of cheese are said to be annually exported from the wharfs at Derby, Shardlow, &c. &c. Shottle and Aldwark are particularly famous for toasting cheese. The grass lands in Beighton, Eckington, and Norton, chiefly supply Sheffield with milk, which is carried in barrels, slung on horses or asses/ In the parishes of Ashover, Morton, Shirland, and North and South Winfield, camomile is cultivated for medicinal purposes in considerable quantities.

Within the last twenty or thirty years, its cultivation has considerably increased in consequence of the demand of the Ame rican market and for home consumption. There are now about 80 acres planted with camomile, producing from three to six cwt. per acre, and varying in price, of late years, from 4I. to 81. 8s. per cwt/ The cultivation of camomile and gathering the flowers furnishes employment for a great number of women and children/ Valerian and Elecampane are cultivated in Ashover and North-Winfield in small quantities. The former produces about 18 cwt. of the root per acre, which is sold at about 90s. Rose-trees are cultivated in the parish of Ashover, for the flowers, the leaves of which are sold to the London druggists, the price being from 5s. to 7s. per pound. There are many acres, near the principal towns, occupied by market-gardens. The chief subterraneous productions of this county as articles of com merce, are lead d, iron, calamine, black-jack, fluor, gypsum, coals, marble, and stone of various sorts. It is well ascertained that the Derbyshire lead-mines were worked by the Romans, and probably by the Britons. They are chiefly in the wapentake of Wirksworth, and the lower part of the Peak, as far north as Castleton. There are lead mines also in the parishes of Ashover, Crich, and Calke, and lead-ore has been found in Turndich and Mugginton. The whole number of lead-mines, enumerated by Mr. Farey in his Agricultural Survey, amounts to about 250 ; of which number, twenty-two are stated to pro duce an abundant supply of ore/ Pilkington states, that the mines in the wapentake of Wirksworth yielded 1306 tons of lead in 1782, those in the parish of Crich, 200 tons. The Ashover mines, he states, had then produced 201 1 tons annually for six years, and the Gregory mine alone, in that parish, from 1758 to 1783, 151 1 tons annually/ The annual quantity b From the information of Mr. William Milnes of Ashover. c The women earn from iod.to is. a day by weeding, hoeing, &c. and from is. to is. 3d. by gathering the flowers at l^d. a peck. d Fuller says, that \" the lead of Derbyshire is the best in England, (not to say Europe :) it is not churlish, but good-natured metal, not curdling into knots and knobs, but all equally fusil ; and therefore most useful for pipes and sheets, yea, the softness thereof will receive any artificial impression.\" e The productive mines are stated to be in the parishes or chapelries of Ashover, Matlock, Cromford, Wirksworth, Bonsall, Youlgrave, Elton, Winster, Hope, Eyam, Great -Longsdon, and Monyash. f The lead raised from the Gregory mine, from 1758 to 1806, when the concern was given up, produced a clear profit of 1 oo.oool. after expending upwards of 23,0001. in making trials for the discovery of new veins, &c.

Of late years, not above half that quantity has been raised, many mines having ceased working on account of the low price of lead/ The most productive mine of late years has been the Gang-mine in the liberty of Cromford, in the parish and wapentake of Wirksworth/ The mines in the Peak and in the wapentake of Wirksworth belonged to the crown at an early period. The Survey of Domesday mentions three mines at Wirksworth, and one in each of the manors of Crich, Ashford, Bake well, and Mestesford. The King's mine at Wirksworth was granted to Robert del Don by Edward I.1: that of Crich, which had been granted by King John to Hubert Fitz-Ralph, was confirmed by Edward II. to Roger de Belers in 1325/ The Devonshire family have long been lessees of the mines in the hundred of High-Peak. The lease of those in the wapentake of Wirksworth, was in the family of Rowles, and having been lately sold under a decree of chancery, is now vested in Richard Ark wright, Esq. The mines and miners of Derbyshire are governed by certain ancient customs and regulations which were ascertained by a jury under a com mission granted in the year 1287.1 The mining concerns are under the superintendence of an officer called a bar-master, who holds courts twice a year. At these courts, are decided all questions respecting the duties payable to the crown, or the lessee ; controversies relating to working the mines, and punishments are inflicted for all offences committed upon mineral pro perty. Debts incurred in working the mines are cognizable also in the bar-mote courts, which are held at Monyash for the Peak, and at Wirks worth for the wapentake. The ancient punishment for stealing ore, on the third conviction, was, that the offender's hand should be struck through with a knife unto the haft into the stowm, where it was to remain until the offender was released by death, unless he loosed himself by cutting off his hand/ s In the year 1808 it was from 35I. to 40I. per Hull-fodder, from which it has gradually fallen to between 16 and 18I. 11 From the information of Mr. William Milnes of Ashover. ; Pat.

One"], [223, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCV One of the most remarkable of the ancient mining customs is that by which any adventurer who shall discover a vein of lead, unoccupied in the King's field, has a right to work it on the land of any person, without making any compensation to the proprietor : this custom is still in force, but it is understood that gardens, orchards, and highways, are excepted. It is the office of the bar-master, being applied to for that purpose, to put ad venturers into possession of such veins by them discovered; The duties or tolls payable to the crown, and to the lord of the manor are of great antiquity: they vary very much in different parts of the Peak. Tithes are paid for lead-ore in the parishes of Eyam and Wirksworth. The brazen dish \u00b0, by which the measure of the ore is regulated, is kept at Wirksworth : the records of the bar-mote court, which was kept in ancient times at the castle of the Peak, are now at Chatsworth. The laws and customs of the mines vary in different manors, as well as the amount of tolls paid. An account of the laws and customs of the lead mines in Derbyshire was first published in 1649 ; and \" The Liberties and Customs of those within the Wapentake of Wirksworth, in metre, by Edward Manlove, Esq., steward of thcBargh-moot court,\" in 1653. Thomas Houghton published a collection of the laws and customs in 1687. A second edition of this work under the title of \" The complete Miner,\" was published at Derby in 1729 ; George Steer published in 1734, \"The complete mineral laws of Derbyshire, including the Laws and Customs of the Manors of Eyam, Stony-Middleton, Ashford, Litton, Tideswell,\" &c. The latest edition of the Mineral Laws was published in 1772. It has been observed, that these laws stand in great need of revising, as inap plicable to the present state of mining/ The lead of Derbyshire was originally smelted by wood-fires on hills, in the open air/ Mr. Farey has given a list of the places where this process was carried on. This inconvenient mode was succeeded by what were called hearth-furnaces. Pilkington says, that two of these remained in the county at the time of his writing, (about 1789,) but Mr. Farey, in his Agri cultural Survey, states, that the last hearth-furnace (which was at Rowsley) was pulled down about the year 1780 ; and that another at Hazleford-hridge 0 It appears, by the inscription on it, that it was made in the year 1512. \u2022\" See Farey's Agricultural Survey. 1 Camden, in the first edition of his Britannia (1585), observes, that the lead was melted OB the tops of the hills, exposed to the west wind, near Crich and Wirksworth. b b 2 near"], [224, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCVI near Hathersage, had been pulled down some time before. The same writer says, that a company of Quakers introduced the improved cupola furnace, now in use, from Wales, and erected one at Kelstedge in Ash over. The smelting business has of late been on the decline, and there are now only nine cupolas in the county ; two of these have two furnaces each.' A considerable quantity of lead is sent from Cromford to Derby, where it is used in making white lead, red lead, sheet lead, pipes, and shot : the re mainder is for the most part sent down the canal from Chesterfield to coast ing vessels in the Trent, for the London and Hull markets. Several of the lead mines in Derbyshire produce ores of zinc in con siderable quantities. The more valuable, the calamine, or oxide of zinc is found in 24 mines, as enumerated in Mr. Farey's list, in the parishes of Matlock, Bonsall, Carsington, Castleton, Bakewell, Youlgrave, and Brad borne : it is produced in the greatest abundance in Whitlow mine, in the parish of Bonsall. In this parish are calamine works belonging to the Cheadle brass company : there is a calamine work also at Cromford. A considerable quantity is sent to Sheffield for the brass company at that place. The dis covery of the uses of calamine is rather of modern date : the miners, who formerly called it spelter, were wholly ignorant of its properties and value, not much more than a century ago, about which time it was first used in this country in the composition of brass/ Dr. Watson, in his Chemical Essays published in 1782, says, that the quantity of calamine raised annually in Derbyshire amounted to 1 500 tons, although sixty years before, not more than 40 tons were raised in a year. Pilkington says, that from the best information he could obtain, not more than 500 tons were, at the time of his writing, annually collected from the several places where this article was found.1 Derbyshire calamine was then from 30s. to 40s. per ton in its crude state ; in its prepared state, from five to six guineas. The average quantity raised for the last four or five years has been about 400 tons; the present price in its crude state is from 5I. to 61. 10s. person, r From the information of Mr. William Milnes of Ashover. ' Campbell's Political Survey, vol. ii. p. 35. Pilkington says, that within 20 years of the date of his writing, (his work was published in 1789,) the use of calamine in the composition of brass was a secret. 1 We find, on enquiry, that a considerably increased quantity of calamine was raised about 1782 : the quantity raised varies according to the demand. About 1810, a thousand tons were raised annually. according"], [225, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCVII according to its quality ; in its prepared state from 14I. 10s. to 15I. 10s. per ton. The other species of zinc ore found in Derbyshire is called blende or black-jack. Mr. Farey mentions 13 mines in which it is found: it is of inferior value and not so much in use. Many tons of it, nevertheless, were dressed four or five years ago at Ashover and Matlock, and sent to Bristol and Birmingham, at five pounds and five guineas a ton. Oxid of manganese, called in Derbyshire black-wad, is found in a few of the lead mines in the parishes of Bakewell, Harrington, and Youlgrave. At Wensley, there was a kiln about 20 years ago for preparing this substance as a black pigment for painting ships, &c. and the proprietoi had a contract with government for supplying it at 70s. a ton\": it is not now prepared in the county. Fluors of various colours are found in several of the Derbyshire mines. These fluors are much used for promoting the fusion of brittle and churlish ore : the yellow spar from Crich is used at the iron-works at Butterley and Somercotes. The more beautiful specimens of fluor called Blue-john, are wrought into vases and various ornamental articles of furniture, &c. at the manufactory in Derby. Iron has from a very early period been known as the produce of this county. Mr. Farey estimates Derbyshire to be the fourth county in Eng land as to its produce of pig-iron. He enumerates 59 places where mines are now or have been formerly worked for iron-stone. The district in which the iron-stone is found begins in the neighbourhood of Dale-abbey, extending northward throughout the hundred of Scarsdale into Yorkshire. Pilkington speaks of the beds of iron-stone in Morley-park, near Heage, and those in the parishes of Wihgervvorth, Chesterfield, and Stavely, as being the most valuable. Until about the year 1770, all the cast and bar-iron in Derbyshire was made by small charcoal furnaces. One of these, worked by a water-wheel, remained at Wingerworth till 1784. Mr. Farey gives a list of 23 places where he had observed traces of these furnaces. The first furnace of the modern construction, heated with coke or pit coal, was erected at Morley-park by Mr. Hurt. In 1806, there were in Derbyshire eleven of these furnaces * in full work; at which 10,329 tons of pig-iron were u This was in the crude state : it was sold at the same time, in a prepared state, at from 60I. to 70I. per ton. 1 Morley-park, Wingerworth, Stavely, Dale- Abbey, Butterley, Rcnishaw, Alfreton, Hasland, Duckmanton, and two at Chesterfield. made"], [226, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCVIII made in a year. Some of these have not of late been regularly worked, on account of the low price of British iron. Pilkington estimates the annual produce of Derbyshire, for some years previously to 1789, at about 5600 tons. There are eight forges in Derbyshire, in which bar-iron is made from the pigs. At most of these works there is an apparatus for rolling and splitting ; besides which, there are rolling and splitting mills at Derby and Burrowash. It is probable, that the Derbyshire collieries were worked by the Romans. Whitaker has brought forward evidence of their having been known to the Saxons, and there can be little doubt that this useful article, which is so abundant in the county, has been in constant use from a much earlier period, although we have not seen any mention of collieries in records before the year i3o6y, when it appears that those at Denby, which are still esteemed to produce some of the best coals in the county, were worked. The principal coal district is the same as that of the iron-stone, including the greater part of the hundred of Scarsdale, and extending southward on the east side of the county, as far as Dale- Abbey. Coals are found also in a part of the parish of Glossop, in that of Harrington, and in a district south of the Trent, including the parishes of Gresley, Calke, Hartshorn, Smithsby, and part of Stapenhill. It is scarcely possible to ascertain the quantity of coal dug annually in this county ; but it is known to be very large. Great quantities (although much diminished within the last two years) are consumed in the various founderies and other works in the county, as well as for domestic uses ; and the export by the Cromford, Derby, and Erwash canal, and the Trent navigation, is very considerable. In 1808, it appears that 269,456 tons of coals were weighed, to be sent by the canals above-mentioned southwards, exclusively of coals from the collieries of Lord Middleton and Mr. Drtiry Lowe, who declined to adopt the regulations for weighing entered into by the other coal-owners. Of the coals above-mentioned, 205,006 tons were hard coals, being the only sort which finds a ready sale in the midland counties, to which the Derbyshire coal is exported/ The collieries in Derby shire are for the most part in the occupation of lessees. The Duke of Devon shire, Sir H. Hunloke, Edward Miller Mundy, Esq., William Drury Lowe, Esq., D'Ewes Coke, Esq., and the Reverend Henry Case Morewood, are the only considerable land-owners who raise coals on their own account/ 1 See Abr. Placit. 260. - Farey's Agricultural Survey, vol. i. p. 185. * The Duke of Devonshire's collieries are at Stavely, Heath, &c. ; Sir Henry Hunloke's at Wingerworth ; Mr. Mundy's at Shipley, &c. ; Mr. Drury Lowe's at Denby and Locko-park ; Mr. Coke's at Pinxton ; and Mr. Morewood's at Alfreton. 4 Gypsum"], [227, "DERBYSHIRE. CXCIX Gypsum or alabaster is raised in considerable quantities in the parish of Chellaston. In its native state it is used for columns \", chimney pieces, and other ornamental building, as well as tombstones and monumental effigies, for which purposes it is sold at 20s. per ton. In its calcined state it is applied at the potteries and elsewhere to all the uses of plaister of Paris : the inferior sort is used for plaister floors. Pilkington speaks of the quantity of gypsum raised at the Chellaston pit, as about 800 tons annually, 500 tons of which were sent to the potteries in Staffordshire. We have been informed that the present quantity raised is about 1000 tons. There is a kiln on the Derby canal for preparing the plaister, and another at Derby belonging to Messrs. Brown and Mavve. There is another pit of gypsum near Aston, and there were formerly others in the parish of Elvaston, on Ballingdon hill near Ambaston. These have been several years closed. Pilkington speaks of the gypsum of these pits, as the most valuable which had been got in the county. The limestone of this county may be esteemed as a valuable article of produce. Mr. Farey enumerates 46 quarries of it, and 63 kilns in which it is burnt for sale. Great quantities are sold at these kilns, chiefly for agricultural purposes, for the use of this and some of the neighbouring counties. The largest quarries are at Ashover, Crich, and Calver near Barslovv. Considerable quantities of* lime are sent from Calver into York shire, and from the neighbourhood of Buxton into Cheshire and Stafford shire. Nearly 30,000 bushels of lime have been sold yearly for manure at the Knitaker lime-kilns, in the parish of Barlborough/ Some of the Derbyshire limestones are in request as marble for chimney pieces, slabs, &c. Mr. Farey gives a list of 19 quarries'1 whence this sort of limestone or Derbyshire marble is procured. There are mills for sawing and polishing marble ' at Wirksworth, Bonsall, and Lea-bridge. Mr. Farey enumerates 138 stone quarries in Derbyshire, some of which produce an ashlar of a good and durable quality for building.

Grindstones made of the mill-stone grit are in great request, and are exported in great quantities by the canals to the south-east parts of England. Of late there has been a great demand for the coarse grind-stones from Gregory quarry at Overton in Ashover. Mr. Farey enumerates 19 quarries in Derbyshire, from which the grind-stones are procured. Coarse whet-stones for sharpening scythes, called scythe-stones, are procured from 13 quarries in this county; the finer whet-stones from seven others. The finest whet-stones, called hones, for setting a fine edge on knives, razors, &c, are procured from quarries at Codnor-park and Woodthorp near Wingerworth. The Heage whet stones are used by the petrefaction workers at Derby. Several mines in this county produce ochres f, and China-clay is found in a few of them in small quantities/ The last-mentioned article, which is found chiefly at Brassington, was used formerly at the porcelain works in Derby. Of late it has been sent to the potteries in Staffordshire. Pipe-clay is found in Bolsover, Killamarsh, Hartshorn, and Harrington ; potters' clay of various sorts and fire-clay in the coal districts ; the latter is in high repute for making bricks, &c, to be used in the structure of iron furnaces, coarse crucibles, &c. Manufactures. Mr. Farey in his Survey of Derbyshire, drawn up for the Board of Agriculture, speaks of Derbyshire, in its character of a manufacturing county, as ranking next to Lancashire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire. The earliest manufacture we read of, as connected with this county, is that of wool, which seems to have been established before the reign of King John, when an exclusive privilege of dying cloth was granted to the bur gesses of Derby. Three fulling-mills at Derby are spoken of in Queen Mary's charter. The woollen manufacture is now chiefly carried on in the parish of Glossop, on the borders of Yorkshire, in which are not less than seven factories and four fulling-mills. Blanket weaving is carried on at Whittington; worsted spinning at Derby\", Melbourne, Tideswell, &c. f Ashover, Bradwell, Brassington, Brushfield, Castleton, Cromford, Great-Hucklow, Hart ington, and Wirksworth. s Four in the chapelry of Brassington, and one in the parish of Hartington. h There are two worsted-mills in the parish of St. Werburgh. 6 The"], [229, "DERBYSHIRE. CCI The silk-mill was first introduced into Derbyshire in the beginning of the last century ; the improved machinery was brought over from Italy about the year 1717, as is more particularly shewn in the account of Derby. The silk manufacture has increased, and is still flourishing at Derby. The manufacture of stockings was introduced at Derby about the same time as the silk-mills; and Derby is one of the four towns' which are esteemed the chief seat of the stocking manufacture. The manufactures of Derby acquired additional celebrity by the ingenious discovery of Mr. Jedidiah Strutt, who introduced a machine for making ribbed stockings about the year 1755 : this species of goods acquired the name of the Derby Rib. The stocking manufacture is chiefly carried on in private dwellings, in the towns and neighbourhood of Derby and Chesterfield, and most of the villages on the eastern side of the county/ The manufacture of cotton, except what was used in making stockings, does not appear to have been introduced into Derbyshire before the year 177 1, when Sir Richard Arkwright established one of the first cotton-mills on the improved principles at Cromford. In 1773, those two eminent be nefactors to their country, whose industry and talents contributed so largely to the extension of its manufactures, the late Mr. Jedidiah Strutt and Sir Richard Arkwright, in conjunction with Mr. Samuel Need, made at Derby the first successful attempt, to establish the manufacture of calicoes in this kingdom. This county, therefore, as having been the cradle of some of the most important branches of the cotton manufacture, stands in the highest rank in point of interest, and may be reckoned almost the first with respect to the extent of its concerns. In 1787, the number of cotton-mills in England, Wales, and Scotland, are said to have been 143 ; in England only, 119: of these, 41 were in Lancashire, and 22 in Derbyshire.1 The number of cotton-mills in Derbyshire alone are now 112, of which one half are in the parish of Glossop : there are several others in the Peak, (at Castleton, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Tideswell, &c.) There are cotton-mills also at Matlock, Crich, Pleasley, Sawley, Measham, kc.m Very'numerous also are the factories connected with the cotton trade. It is stated by Mr. Farey, that there are in this county 43 factories for calico ' The others are, Leicester, Loughborough, and Nottingham. k All the townships in which this manufacture is carried on arc enumerated in the third volume of Farey's Survey. 1 Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia. \" They are all enumerated in Farey's third volume. weaving ; Vol. V. c c"], [230, "DERBYSHIRE.

Machines for the cotton factories, stocking-frames, &c, are made at Derby, Alfreton, Glos sop, Belper, Heanor, Matlock, Butterley, &c. The linen manufacture is not of great extent in Derbyshire. Flax spin ning is carried on, and there are linen-yarn mills in the parishes of Ash over, Matlock, Glossop, Brampton, and Crich ; linen weaving in Ashover, Brampton, Belper, Turndich, &c. ; tape weaving and cambric weaving in Glossop , and lace weaving in Derby and Melbourne. There are 28 tan-yards in various parts of the county ; nine skinners, four curriers, and jive factories of white leather/ At Hartshorn is a mill for oiled and chamois leather. Shoes are made for the wholesale trade at Chesterfield and other places. In this county there are 12 dye-houses, nine paper-mills, 13 rope-walks, and three whipcord manufactories/ The smelting houses for lead, and the iron furnaces for preparing the ore have been already spoken of, under the article of Produce. There are red and white lead works at and near Derby, and red-lead works in the parish of Chesterfield, at Alderwasley, and at Lea-wood ; there is a shot mill at Derby. Connected with the iron-trade are various manufactories, some of which are carried on to a great extent. The cast-iron works at Chesterfield, But terley, &c, carried on very extensive manufactures of cannon, cannon-balls, &c, during the war. Agricultural tools are manufactured in various parts of the county. Scythes, sickles, hoes, and spades, are made chieflyin the northern part of the county, between Chesterfield and Sheffield ; there are three factories of reaping-hooks and seven of sickles, in the parish of Eckington ; eight scythe-smiths in Norton, five in Eckington, and four in Dronfield/ Cutlery, and other steel articles are made at Derby, Chesterfield, and in the villages to the north of the last-mentioned town. Spurs and bridle-bits are made at Bolsover and New Brampton ; needles at Hathersage. There are six chain manufactories, chiefly in the north part of the county/ Nail-making is carried on to a great extent, chiefly at and in the neighbourhood of Belper; though of late the trade has expe rienced a considerable check.

There is a large manufactory of spar or fluor ornaments at Derby, and saw-mills for marble and stone, at Bonsall, Lea-bridge, and Wirksworth. At Derby is a long-established porcelain manufactory : there is a porce lain manufactory also at Pinxton. There are potteries at and near Chester field, Alfreton, Belper, Ilkeston, Gresley, Hartshorn, Tickenhall, &c. Tobacco-pipes are made at Chesterfield and at New-Brampton.

Besides the manufactories already mentioned, Mr. Farey enumerates among others one glass-house, one gun-powder mill, a brass-foundery, at Ashborne ; mills for grinding colours at Bonsall and Derby ; a manufactory of button-moulds at Whittington, and several mills for crushing bones, used for the purposes of manure. Antiquities. British Antiquities. The barren moors of Derbyshire abound with rude masses of grit stone, and single stones of large sizes appearing above the surface, as those of granite do in Cornwall; and here, as in that county, many of them have been considered as owing their present forms to art, and supposed to have been memorials of our British ancestors. Here too, as in Cornwall, among the detached masses of grit-rock, many rocking-stones have been found, and rock-basins in abundance, and as usual ascribed to the Druids ; but as we have before observed, we are inclined to refer the greater part of these to natural causes ; indeed, with respect to the round hollows in the gritstone rocks, which have been for ages exposed to the effects of the atmosphere, we observed as many of them on the perpendicu lar sides of the rock as on the top, especially in Sir Joseph Banks's park at Overton where they are particularly abundant. The only remains in Derbyshire, which we can suppose to have been the works of the early inhabitants of our island, are, the circles of stones and some upright stones, tumuli of earth and stones (here called lows), and ' Farey's Survey. some C C 2"], [232, "DERBYSHIRE. CCIV some rude military works in the uncultivated parts of the county. On Stanton-moor, Hartle-moor, Hathersage-moor, and Olney-moor, are several circles of stones\", but none of them of large dimensions. The only remark able work of this kind within the county of Derby, is Arbour-Lows in the hamlet of Middleton, about three miles south-west of Youlgrave, which con sists \" of an area encompassed by a broad ditch, which is bounded by a high mound or bank, and the form of the whole is nearly that of an ellipsis ; the area measures from east to west forty-six yards, and fifty-two in the con trary direction ; the width of the ditch is six, and the height of the bank, on the inside, five yards. To the north and south, there is an opening about fourteen yards wide. In the area are several stones of different sizes ; about thirty large ones lie round the border of it, and generally point with the narrower end towards the centre : they are rough and unhewn, and are, for the most part, about five feet long, three broad, and one thick; besides these, there are about fourteen smaller ones intermixed with them in an irregular manner0 ;\" and three lying near the centre, one of which is larger than any of the rest, being thirteen feet long and eight feet v/ide. The late Dr. Pegge, who communicated an account of this ancient monument to the Society of antiquaries p, supposes it to have been a British temple, and that the stones originally stood upright, two and two ; the smaller ones he considers as frag ments of the larger, broken off when they were thrown down. It seems, however, difficult to conceive that they should all have been thus prostrated, which must have been a work of no small labour, for no apparent purpose. Arbour-lows derives its name from a large low or tumulus adjoining the vallum near the southern entrance, and another at a small distance from it. In the year 1795 two Kistvaens or British sepulchres, were discovered on opening a large tumulus, about two miles north-west from Ashford ; in one of these was a skeleton with the face downwards, having a piece of the black Derbyshire marble two feet long, nine inches wide, and six inches thick, lying on the scull ; under the head were two arrow-heads of flint : the other contained burnt bones and ashes. In other parts of the tumulus were found, two urns of coarse pottery full of ashes and burnt bones ; two skeletons deposited on the level ground, and a spear head of stone/ n See Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. vi. p. 112, 113. vol. vii. p. 19. 177. 0 Pilkington's Derbyshire, vol. ii. p. 459. p Printed in the Arch\u00e6logia, vol. vii. p. 131. 11 Communicated by Hayman Rooke, Esq., to the Society of Antiquaries, and printed in the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. xii. p. 327.

The Britons had certainly one of their principal roads, the Rykneld, running through its whole extent, from south-west to north-east, from the borders of Staffordshire to those of Yorkshire. The name is British, the R, according to Whitaker, being prefixed to distin guish it as the road of the Upper Iceni, while the Ikeneld way itself led towards Norfolk, the country of the Iceni, properly so called. \" The Caers or Carls work, near Hathersage, bears marks of British origin ; it lies in the wildest part of the High-Peak, near the present road from Manchester to Sheffield, and includes the summit of a hill, which is very steep on all sides but one, and defended on that by a wall of rude and singnlar construction, consisting of three rows of very large stones, with other stones placed obliquely upon them, pointing towards the assailants.

Mr. Pegge has conjectured, that one of these pigs bears so early a date as the time of the Emperor Claudius ; and if this was the fact, it would go far to prove, that the mines in the Peak, were worked by the natives before the time of the Roman invasion ; as it is highly improbable, that in a short time after the landing of the Romans, they should have so far subdued the Coritani, in the central part of the island, as to have established their own works and workmen in this remote district ; or if, as other antiquaries have contended, this lead formed part of the tribute paid by the islanders themselves, (though not yet finally subdued,) to the Roman Emperor, it would carry up the British trade in these metals to a very remote period. \" From the existence, however, of the trade, and the consequent popu lation of the country, we may expect to find Derbyshire traversed in every direction by Roman roads ; and such seems to have been the case.

It enters Derbyshire from this last county, over the Dove at Monks-bridge, and its crest is visible on Egginton-heath, though much obliterated by the modern turnpike-road, which continues in its line as far as Little-Over ; where, a little before it reaches the two mile stone, the Roman road keeps its north-north-east direction, while the present one slants to the east towards Derby. The old road, though not easy to be distin guished in the cultivation so general near a populous town, crossed Nun's green, and proceeded down Darley slade to the banks of the Derwent, \u00b0 Vol. V. d d passing"], [240, "DERBYSHIRE. CCX passing that river by a bridge, (the piers of which may be felt in a dry summer,) to the station of Little-Chester, the Derventio of Richard, and placed by him at the distance of twelve miles from ad Trivonam (Berry farm at Branston-upon-Trent, to which it exactly answers). It is by no means improbable, that the British Rykneld-street crossed the Derwent lower down at a ford, perhaps at the very place where Derby now stands ; and then resuming its northerly course, would pass the east wall of the Roman town, as Stukeley has represented it in his map. The Roman road, however, on crossing the Derwent seems to have passed the meadows near the north gate of the station, and after clearing the houses of the vicus, would fall into the Rykneld-street, near the north-east angle of the vallum, and pro ceed with it in its old line. The ground about the modern village of Little- Chester being chiefly under the plough, the ridge of the road near it has been long destroyed ; but on passing Breadsall priory on the left, and rising up towards the alms-houses on Morley-moor, a large fragment of it is visible on the right hand : and again, though less plainly, on the moor itself, abutting on the fence about a hundred yards east of Brackley gate. It next appears close to Horsley-park, a little west of the lodge, and is very high, covered with furze in the first inclosure ; then passing through another field or two, crosses the road from Wirksworth to Not tingham, about a hundred yards west of Horsley-woodhouse ; being quite plain in the inclosure south of the road called Castlecroft, and again in the field to the north of it. It now enters an old lane, which it soon quits, and maybe seen in afield or two to the left, running down to a house called Cumbersome, which stands upon it ; from hence, down another field, over Botolph (corruptly Bottle) brook, which it crosses straight for the Smithy houses, and enters a lane called, from it, the Street-lane, where it is visible for more than a mile, as far as the water ; here the lane bends to the east, while the Roman way keeps its old north-north-east bearing, up a field or two, to the lane from Heage to Ripley ; this lane it crosses, and goes on to Hartey ; from hence it points to the tail of Hartey-dam, and is visible in the hedge of the field near the miller's house. It now runs to Coney-Gre-house, crossing two' lanes which lead from Pentrich Town to the common, and so down to the water ; leaving a camp, which is Roman by its form, and was probably a station, a very little to the left. It is again seen on the north side of the water, pointing up the lane to Oakerthorp, but enters the enclosures on the left, before it reaches the village ; and fragments of its ridge are quite plain in the croft"], [241, "DERBYSHIRE CCXI croft opposite the manor-house/ On the other side of Oakerthorp the crest again appears in a line with this ridge, within the left hand fence ; it now runs to the four lane ends, over the ground on which Kendal's, or the Pea cock-Inn, stands, and Limbury chapel formerly stood ; and where its gravel was dug up in laying the foundation of the summer-house. Traces of build ings, too, have been dug up in Ufton-hall field, on the other side of the road, but nothing certain is known about them. It here crosses the present road, and enters the fields on the right, but re-crosses it again on the declivity of the hill, and is visible for a mile in the demesne lands of Shirland-hall, called the Day-Cars, bearing for Higham. Hence, along the line of the present turnpike road to Clay-cross, through the vil lage of Stretton ; then to Egstow, (where is a large barrow,) and is quite plain for 300 yards, through some small inclosures (particularly in the Quakers burying-ground,) and over a part of Tupton-moor, near the black smith's forge ; and in an old survey of Egstow farm, belonging to the Hunloke family, it is, as I have said, expressly described under the name of the Rignal-street. From this spot, which is about twenty miles from Derby, it is no longer visible, but it points, when last seen, directly for the middle of Sir Henry Hunloke's avenue, and probably went from hence to Tupton hill, near Chesterfield, which is in the same line only three miles further, and where several Roman coins have been found, so that there seems good ground for supposing this town, as the name imports, to have been a station on the road, very probably the Lutudarum of Ravennas.\" The country people have a tradition of the road going on still further to the north, and that after crossing the Rother near Chesterfield, it proceeded on the east side of that brook, passing on the west of Killamarsh church, and through the parish of Beighton into Yorkshire ; but I am more inclined to think the Roman road continued exactly in its old bearing on the west side of the river, leaving Whittington on the left, through West-Handley and Ridgway to the Roman camp on the banks of the Don, while the old Rykneld-street, proceeds on the east side into Yorkshire. \" It is to be remarked, that this whole road is one of those omitted by Antonine, and mentioned, with the stations upon it, by Richard only ; and that such a road did exist, after it has been thus traced by so judicious an antiquary as Mr. Pegge, it is impossible for any one to doubt. The case p In this part of its course it leaves Alfreton (which some writers supposed it passed through, and have even called a station on it) without notice, nearly two miles on its right. 1 The occurrence of the name of this station on the Roman pigs of lead found in Derbyshire, affords a strong confirmation of this conjecture. See p. cevi. S.L. d d 2 is"], [242, "DERBYSHIRE CCXII is the same with the roads in Scotland, described in Richard's ninth and tenth iters, which have been examined by General Roy and Mr. Chalmers, and with that in Yorkshire laid down in his seventh, which Dr. Thomas Whitaker, though he denies the authority of Richard himself; confesses to run exactly as he describes it. As these roads are not alluded to by Antonine in the slightest degree, while evident marks of them are found where Richard has placed them, I confess myself to be one of those who do not think it possible to dispute the authenticity of the materials he has collected. \" The second Roman road in this county, which has been examined both by Mr. Pegge and John Whitaker, (the historian of Manchester,) runs through the north part of it, under the name of the Bathom-gate ; it has been traced clearly from Brough to Buxton. On leaving the station of Brough in Hope parish, the Roman road is discoverable bearing south-west, as soon as it passes the second waterflash called the Burghwash, and frag ments of its broad ridge may be seen in the lane. It then enters Bull meadow, running up the hedge on the left, but soon appears again in the lane leading to Smaldale, where the right hand hedge stands upon it. It then runs into the enclosures called the Doctor's Pasture and Bagshaw Pasture, and after crossing Gray ditch, bends north-west to ascend the hill, being found by the spade and plough, in a line well known to the farmers, till it comes upon the moor three quarters of a mile on the Brough side of Bathom-edge, where the crest is quite plain to the stone fence which separates Bradwell and Tideswell moors ; retaining here its original breath of 18 or 20 feet, \"and sweeping,\" as Whitaker describes it in his flowery language, \" in a long strait streak of vivid green over the purple surface of the heath.\" It is also visible on the Buxton side of this hedge for about a mile, bearing south-west for the inclosures at the dam in the forest, and crosses the turnpike road from Manchester to Chesterfield, then after just entering Hernstone-lane it is visible in the field on the left, where, in a dry summer, the grass is of a different colour ; from hence it runs in a straight green lane towards Fairfield,j3*bein'g seen again on Fairfield-moor, and is found by digging to have kept the same line to the hill above Buxton. \" The late Mr. King, who was better acquainted with our ancient castles than with our roads, was inclined to think that this road was only a communi cation between the bath at Buxton and the castle of his unknown chief upon Mam-Tor. That it might have been in use for such a purpose is pro bable enough, but the road itself is a common Roman one, bearing every distinguishing"], [243, "DERBYSHIRE. \u2022eclriii distinguishing mark of being constructed by that people ; and joining two of their most decided stations, Buxton and Brough, without appearing to be any way connected with Mam-Tor. Though it passes accidentally near it. \" At Buxton, as Mr. Watson contends, a third road from the Roman station at Manchester, fell into that we have just followed from Brough. This Manchester road coming from Stockport and Saltersfbrd-hall in Cheshire, where it is known by the name of the Old-gate, runs, according to his idea, by Pym-chair to the head of the river Goit : here it is joined, as Whitaker also allows, by a Roman way from Chester, and proceeds on the west of the present turnpike road to Cracking- stones, and thence to the station at Buxton. Mr. Leman, however, (whose authority is of great weight) is rather inclined to suppose it continued more on the line of the modern road. The existence of the road itself is unquestionable. \" A fourth Roman way may be traced, as I before observed, on the south side of Buxton, in the direction of Little-Chester. The Roman road leaves Buxton in the track of the present Ashborne road, passes through Over-street, and near the 27th mile-stone, where, as the turnpike road bears off to the west, it keeps its own straight line, and is visible on the left hand of it, from Hurdlow-house to Pike-hall; being still called among the peasants by its proper name the Roman road. It leaves Aldwark to the left, is visible on Brassington-moor, passes close by Hopton, where the late Mr. Gell opened a part of it, and probably between Keddleston-park and Duf field to Darley-slade, where it joins the great road from Ad Trivonam, and crosses the river with it to Little-Chester. It takes no notice of the camp at Parwich, though it has every appearance of being Roman, but leaves it about two miles to the right. \" Another considerable Roman road also meets this last on the banks of the Derwent, bearing directly east from Staffordshire, most probable from Chesterton near Newcastle, in that county (the Mediolanum of Antonine's and Richard's tenth iters.) It seems to have crossed the Dove a very little below Rocester, which, from its name and situation, was probably a station on it ; and leaving Marston-Montgomery a little on the right, and Long ford and Langley on the left, crosses the Ashborne road to Derby, at right angles between the second and third mile-stones, in a direct line for the gates of Little-Chester. It is known through the country by the name of the Long-lane, and its whole appearance is such as demonstrates to an antiquary, a Roman, or perhaps a British, origin. After entering Little- Chester it issues from the present main street of the village, by what was probably"], [244, "DERBYSHIRE. CCXIV probably the east gate of the station, and proceeds in its old line, leaving Chaddesden close on the right, through Stanton, into Notting hamshire. \" Mr. Watson, in his very clear and excellent account of the station of Melandra Castle, in Arch\u00e6ol. vol. hi. p. 237, observes, that from the south- east gate of that fort, a Roman road went over the moors to Brough, the line of which, for a great part, is still followed, the old pavement in many places remaining, with drains cut through it when it crosses any marshy ground. It seems to have passed Glossop on the left, running between Cross-Cliff and Whitfield, leaving the great hill of Kinderscout to the south-west, and that of Crookstonclose on the north-east, and bearing in a straight line through Aston, to the north-west entrance of the Roman station at Brough. It is curious enough, that in all this part of its course, it goes by the name of the Doctor' s-Gate, that on the other side of Brough it enters a field called the Doctor's-Pasture : and that a road on the west side of Melandra falls into the great Roman way between Manchester and York, at a place which is termed the Doctor's-Lane-Head. The circumstance evidently points out a connection between the three roads, which were indeed all certainly Roman. \" There are some traces of a road, said to be high raised, near Edingliall, on the south-west borders of Derbyshire, pointing to Lullington, and sup posed to communicate with a more decided one near Tamworth and Dray ton-Basset in Staffordshire. This last is a part of the Salters-way, from Droitwich into Lincolnshire ; and the Edingliall road, if connected with it, would have a claim to be considered as British. It passes, however, through a very small space of this county, and will be traced more particularly in another part of the work \" Nor have we much better information of what Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, calls a bridle road from Derby to Coventry, and which he says is still frequented by the drovers as the best and shortest way between these towns. His informer (who gives a very confused account of it) says, it comes from Stanton, coincides in part of its course with the Salters-way, (which is next to impossible, as the bearings of the two are so different,) and turning south, passes through Sibston, Atterton, and Fen-Drayton, into the Watling-Street, about a mile and a half south-east of Mancester. From this statement, however, it is highly probable that there has been a Roman way in this direction, between Little-Chester and the stations on the Wat ling-Street, which, turning south-south-west after passing the bridge at Derventio, might leave Derby, Osmaston, and Swarkston on the left, cross the"], [245, "DERBYSHIRE. CCXV the Trent from the latter village about Stanley, and running near Staunton- Harold, Ticknal, Smithsby, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, proceed by Swebston and Congest on, crossing the Salters-road near the latter, and keeping its own line (and not turning as has been supposed) straight through Sibston, Atter ton, and Drayton, to the Watling-Street, near Mancester; especially as on the other side of this street, a way, undoubtedly Roman, proceeded in the very same bearing towards Mancester and Chesterton on the Foss. \" Marks of a third of these uncertain roads are supposed to have been seen on the east side of the Derwent, between Little-Chester and Sawley-Ferry, bearing thence to the station of Leicester, or Willoughby on the Fosse ; nor indeed is it likely that so important a place as Little-Chester should have been without some communication of this sort on the side of Rat\u00e6. In fact, this would be the continuance of the Roman road from Buxton in its original bearing. \" Having thus collected as much as is at present known of tlje Roman roads in this county, we come in course to consider the towns or stations in it. Of these Little-Chester was by far the most considerable. It is on the Derwent, about a mile above Derby, which no doubt has risen from its ruins ; the inhabitants, when the bridge over the river was destroyed, set tling (as was most natural) at the nearest ford ; at which also, as I before mentioned, there is reason to think the old British road crossed, a circum stance which would have given an additional reason for the preference. The Roman town is now the site of a small village. Stukeley could trace the wall quite round in his time : the fort was of an oblong figure, containing about six acres ; and streets or roads were to be seen in the fields near it, which he supposed the suburbs. Coins of brass, silver, and gold, with an tiquities of every kind have been found, and foundations of buildings are still sometimes discovered. There is good ground to suppose it was called Derventio, from the neighbouring river, though therewere at least two other towns of the same name in the island ; one near York, and a second in Cumberland. The many roads bearing in every direction to the station, the numerous remains dug up on the spot, and the exact distance from Ad Trivonam and Etocetum, which Richard states Derventio to be in his 18th iter, put this subject out of all reasonable doubt. \" Another Roman town was at Brough, in the parish of Hope. It stood in some fields called the Halsteads, in an angle formed by the junction of two brooks, Bradwell and the Now, a situation which the Romans seem al ways to have chosen if they could possibly obtain it. It is of the shape also to which they gave a preference, an oblong of 310 feet by 270; three ot"], [246, "CCXVI DERBYSHIRE. of the sides being still nearly perfect. Only one or two coins have been found : but urns, bricks, stone columns, foundations, one of a temple or other large building, and a tile with the remains of an inscription, C O H. undoubtedly for Cohors, have been discovered ; and two decided roads, as we have seen, certainly met there. The name is unknown, but the town is undoubtedly Roman. \" A third Roman station, and of the same decided nature as the two last mentioned, is at Melandra Castle, in the parish of Glossop, in the north west part of the Peak, near Cheshire. Mr. Watson, who first discovered it, has given a remarkably good account of it in the third volume of the Ar ch\u00e6ologia. It is nearly square, 122 yards by 1 12 ; and situated like that at Brough, at the meeting of two mountain-brooks. The ramparts and part of the ditch still remain ; and the four entrances, as well as the site of the pr\u0153torium, may be discovered. Foundations of many buildings are on the sides, sloping to the water. A stone too has been dug up, bearing an in scription which makes mention of a centurion of a Frisian cohort, the same body of troops which constituted the Roman garrison at Manchester, to which therefore this fort was probably an out-post. And it may he, that the troops stationed on these remote forts, were recalled to head quarters at the approach of the enemy ; which will account for the few coins found, and the more perfect state of the ramparts, both here and at Brough. \" The last of our certain Roman stations was at Buxton, a spot known probably from very early antiquity for its warm springs ; and evidently inha bited on this account by the Romans, several of whose baths have been discovered here, and one indeed so lately as 178 1, in digging the found ations of the present Crescent. The station itself is supposed by Watson to have been on the hill above the hall, which is known by the name of the Stene or Stane Cliffs. Major Rooke also, in 1787, found remains which he conjectured to be those of a Roman temple. From these circumstances, and still more from the meeting of at least three of their roads at the same point, there is little doubt of a Roman town having existed in this spot \u2022 and there is some foundation for supposing the name of it to have been Aqu\u0153, not only as Aqu\u0153 Sexti\u0153 in Provence, and Aqu\u0153 Solis or Sulis in Somersetshire, were names given by the Romans to places distinguished like this by their warm springs 5 but because in Ravennas (who observes an awkward sort of order in his Geographical Enumeration of our British towns) the Roman station of Aqu\u0153 appears not far from Lindum (Lincoln) 6 on"], [247, "DERBYSHIRE. CCXVII on one side, and Camulodurrum (Slack in Yorkshire) on the other ; a situ ation which agrees perfectly well with this of Buxton. \" The above-mentioned places have all of them, I believe, good claim to be considered as Roman ; but there are two others, whose pretensions are of a more uncertain nature. The first of these is at Parwich, between Bux ton and Ashborne. The camp, which is Roman in its shape, lies about half a mile from the village, at a spot called Lombard's-Green. Roman coins too have been found there, but in an urn, not scattered upon the surface, which last circumstance would have been decisive in its favour. Foundations of walls have been dug up, and a bank, whether a pr\u0153tentura or a road is uncertain, runs strait from it to the Ashborne road on one side, and to a pool of water on the other. It must be owned that the names Lom bard's-Green and Parwich (Parvus Vicus) might warrant the conjecture ; and the distance, which is about half way from Buxton to Little-Chester, would suit well for an intermediate station. But, with all these advantages, the distance of two miles and a half from the Roman road, and an apparent want of connexion with it, is an objection not to be got over. If, indeed, a way from Buxton to Rocester should be found in the direction of the present Ashborne turnpike road, Parwich, being then in the space between two Roman roads, might have some right to be considered as a station to accommodate both ; but till such a discovery is made, an antiquary of any experience must be inclined to suspend his opinion. \" Another camp with a claim of the same nature is at Pentrich, on the Rykneld-Street, between Little-Chester and Chesterfield : its figure also is Roman, being square with a double vallum. It lies close to the road ; one coin at least has been found in it ; and the distance suits well for a mansio between these two stations, being 1 1 or 1 2 miles from each. Indeed, the situation does not at all agree with Richard's present numbers ; and this seems to have misled Mr. Pegge, who does not even notice its pretensions, but supposes the intermediate station would be found at Higham or Lin bury, at the latter of which places, as I observed, foundations of old build ings have been discovered. But the numerals in Richard's iters, which are never remarkably accurate, are less so than usual in these roads, which he alone describes ; being unchecked by those in Antonine, and only guessed at in his rude times by ignorant monks whom he states as his informers. And in this particular iter it is impossible to reconcile them either with one another or with truth ; one station being inserted without name or num bers, and another with a number impossible to be right, being 16 miles Vol. V. e e fronl"], [248, "DERBYSHIRE ccxvm from Chesterfield, and more than that from Derventio.

XVI \" Now if we suppose the number left vacant to be as small as possible, for instance VII., the distance from Little-Chester to Chesterfield, accord ing to Pegge, would be 39 miles, but by actual measurement it is only 23. It is, therefore, far more rational, as Mr. Leman and Whitaker have agreed, to strike out the vacant fifth station, and alter the XVI on each side to XII, which in the first place would agree to the whole distance between Little-Chester and Chesterfield, and in the second to the particular dis tance of Pentrich from both of them ; though this last circumstance seems to have escaped Whitaker's notice. The iter would then stand thus : \u2014 XVI Supposed Chesterfield. XII Supposed Pentrich. XII Little-Chester. \" I should, therefore, without much hesitation, be inclined to rank the camp at Pentrich among the Derbyshire stations, as noticed by Richard in his 1 8 th Iter. \" As to the Roman camp in the gardens of the village, which Pegge states as so plainly to be seen from the hill above Castleton in the Peak, it may have been either a summer camp for the garrison of Brough, or constructed here as a check to the old works on Mam-Tor, which King and others call Roman, but which I should rather suppose British, as we find circumstances exactly similar at Burrinswark in Scotland, and at the foot of the great British camp on Borough-hill near Daventry. \" The camp on Combe-Moss, four miles from Buxton, which Major Rooke is said to have discovered, may in like manner have been a summer or an exploratory camp to that station ; but this antiquary was too apt to suppose all the camps he saw, however irregular in their shape, to be Roman, and he has not left us the slightest description of it to form our opinion on the subject.\" - W. c.

CCXIX Ancient Church Architecture. Saxon. \u2014 Of the ecclesiastical edifices of Derbyshire, the crypt under the parish church of Repton claims the first notice ; there being good reason to suppose, that it was a part of ther conventual church, destroyed by the Danes, who wintered here at this place in the year 874; at which time Edburga, daughter of Adulph, King of the East- Angles, was abbess of Repton. There have been three entrances to this crypt by flights of steps, one on the north side, now open ; and two on the west, which appear to have communicated with the church. It is nearly a square of seventeen feet, the roof being vaulted with circular arches, supported by four columns of less massy proportions than those of the later Saxon archi tecture, the capitals are very plain and square, the bases round, without any mouldings : the shafts are wreathed in different directions. Melbourne church is a very perfect specimen of the massy style of archi tecture which prevailed in the eleventh century ; a plan and sections of this church were published by the Society of Antiquaries, in the thirteenth volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia, from drawings by the late William Wilkins, Esq., who conjectured that it was erected by King Ethelred, in the seventh century. We cannot but think that he has referred this edifice to too early a period, as its style by no means accords with that of the buildings, which, on the best evidence, are supposed to have been erected in the Saxon times ; of which the conventual church at Ely, and the crypt at Repton, are those, whose dates are, perhaps, the best authenticated ; but it coin cides with that of the ecclesiastical edifices, which we know to have been built about the time of the Norman conquest. Melbourne church has undergone little alteration, except in the lower range of windows, which have been enlarged ; it consists of a nave and side aisles, separated by massy pillars, some of the capitals of which are ornamented with foliage and figures of animals, others with crosses : the arches are circular, ornamented with zig-zag mouldings. Between the nave and chancel is a large square tower, the upper part of which is more modern, with pointed windows ; at the east end of each aisle is a chantry. The east end of the chancel and that of each of the chantries, Mr. Wilkins observes, appear to have been originally cir cular ; they are now all square, with Gothic windows. The entrance e e 2 at"], [258, "DERBYSHIRE. CCXX at the west end of the church consists of three porticos, with groined roofs, divided by arches from the nave, having chambers over them : Mr. Wilkins supposes these to be the porticus of the Saxon churches, described by Bede. The whole length of Melbourne church, within the walls, is 133 feet, the width 44 feet 9 inches. A specimen of the archi tecture of the nave is shewn in the annexed plate. The desecrated church of Steetley exhibits a very complete specimen of the later and more enriched style of Saxon architecture, on a small scale. It is quite entire except the roof, and has undergone no alteration except in one of the windows on the south side, which has been enlarged. It con sists of a nave and chancel, each 26 feet in length ; the east end being cir cular and vaulted : the ribs of the arches, and the capitals of the half pillars, from which they spring, are much enriched with various mouldings, gro tesque heads, foliage, and other ornaments. A cornice, supported by brackets, ornamented with roses, heads, &c. runs round the upper part of the building on the outside. The circular part at the east end, has also a fascia of foliage running round it, about the middle of the building ; and is besides enriched with pilasters in the Saxon style. The arch of the south door-way is ornamented with zig-zag mouldings and heads ; the shafts of the pillars are covered with sculptured foliage and other ornaments, in the style of the south door-way of Ely cathedral. Considerable remains of Saxon architecture are to be seen in the churches of Alsop-in-the-Dale, Ashford, Bradburn, Bakewell, Bolsover, Boulton, Brailsford, Brassington, Clown, Darley, Heath, Halt-Hucknall a, Hog naston, Keddleston, Killamarsh, Kirk-Ireton, Ockbrook, Parwich, Sandi acre, Stanton, Swarkston, Tissington, Thorp, Whitwell, Longford, Willington, Winster, and Youlgrave. The south door-ways of those of Ashford, Hognaston, Keddleston, and Swarkston have rude sculptures in bas-relief within the circular arch : of Bradburn and Whitwell churches, the towers at the west-end are in this style of architecture. At the west-end of Bakewell church is a large arch, very richly ornamented with Saxon mouldings and grotesque heads : on the sides of this arch are some re mains of small interlaced arches.

The altar-piece is of stone, enriched with two tabernacles ; and on each side of the east window, over the altar, is an ornamented niche. John Foljambe, who died in 1358, and whose monument is in Tideswell church, is said to have been a principal contributor to the erection of that edifice. The chancels of Norbury, Dronfield, and Sandiacre churches exhibit fine specimens of this style. That of Norbury church has large handsome windows, with much of the original painted glass remaining in them. Remains of the architecture of this century are to be seen in the churches of Mackworth and Marston-upon-Dove : there is a very ele gant window, with a niche on each side, at the east end of the north aisle of Mackworth church ; and in the north wall of the same aisle is an arch, with a richly ornamented canopy over it, between two win dows. Spondon church is a handsome building in the style of this century. Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries. \u2014 There are no remains of the eccle siastical architecture of these centuries worthy of particular notice, except the tower of All-Saints' church at Derby, which has been generally and deservedly admired : it is about 1 50 feet in height, and richly ornamented with Gothic tracing ; that, of the battlements being pierced/ On a fascia, running round three sides of the tower, is this inscription, in text hand \u2014 \" Young men and maydens.\" Painted Glass. \u2014 There are some remains of painted glass in the churches of Ashborne, Bradley, Dronfield, Egginton, Halt-Hucknall, Sandiacre, and Sutton ; but none of sufficient consequence to merit particular notice. In the churches of Morley and Norbury, the remains are considerable : those in the chancel of the latter, are in a very good taste ; and evidently coeval with the building, which is in the style of the fourteenth century. b The elevation of the west side of this tower is given in the annexed plate. Specimens"], [286, "DERBYSHIRE. GCXX11 Specimens, selected from different windows, are shown in the annexed plate. In the north aisle of Morley church are four windows, occupying nearly the whole of the north side, filled with painted glass, said to have been brought from Dale- Abbey, at the time of the dissolution; and con sisting of various legendary subjects, in small compartments, with inscrip tions in text-hand. Both the figures and inscriptions are a good deal mu tilated ; but the subject of several of them, which appear to have belonged to a connected series, may still be made out. They \"relate to a tradition that, on a dispute between the canons at Depedale and the keepers of the forest, the King granted to the canons as much land as, betwixt two suns, could be encircled with a plough drawn by stags, which were to be caught from the forest. Under one of the compartments is this inscription \u2014 \" Go whom and yowke them, and take ye ground t' ye plooe ;\" and under another \u2014 \" Here Saynt Robert plooyth wyth the \" In the east win dow is a figure of St. Ursula, crowned, and surrounded with glory ; and beneath her, two angels, holding the virgins in a cloth ; with this in scription on a label \u2014 \" Sea Ut^sula, cum xi mill, virginum, ascendens in ccelum.\" Rood-lofts, Screens, and Stone Stalls. \u2014 In Ashborne church is a very perfect rood-loft and screen, and at Ilkeston a stone screen of the rood loft, in the style of the thirteenth century. In Chelmorton church is a stone screen, with quatrefoils at the top ; and the lower part of one in Bakewell church. In Elvaston church is an elegant Gothic screen of the rood-loft ; and in the chapel at Hayfield an entire rood-loft, the upper part of which is modernized, and has a modern painting of the crucifixion, and St. Mary, and St. John. In each of the churches of Brailsford, Breadsall, Church-Broughton, Dron field, Ilkeston, Langley, Longford, Sandiacre, and Spondon, are three stone stalls, of equal height. Those of Dronfield and Sandiacre are richly orna mented, in the style of the fourteenth century, and there is a piscina adjoin ing each, in the same style/ In Baslow, Denby, and Whitwell churches are two stone stalls : those at Whitwell are richly ornamented in the style of the fourteenth century. In the chancel of Chaddesden church is a single stone stall, with a piscina; and a single one also in the north, and another in the south aisle of the same church. b See figures of them in the annexed plates, Ancient"], [287, "'\u2022KitHkartt dU. tycomm* os fainted (riafi in the Chancel Windows ofNorburu Church"], [288, ""], [289, ""], [290, ""], [291, "Sfri/c Stflils /// //// r/it/i/if/ Of St//////t//ir (\"/////'/'//"], [292, ""], [293, ""], [294, ""], [295, ".

This font is ornamented with twenty figures of men, in flowing drapery, each holding a book in his left hand ; and differing only in the position of the head, and of the right hand, which is more or less elevated in different figures : they are all very rudely executed in bas-relief, and stand under circular arches, separated by slender pillars. The fonts in Kirk-Hallam and Osmaston churches are circular : the former being orna mented with tracery of semicircular interlaced arches; the latter with tracery of circular arches and foliage. Those in Winster and Mellor churches are large and circular, ornamented with rude sculptures in bas relief. Melbourne font is in the form of a basin, standing on four legs c ; that in Bakewell church is large, and in the Gothic style, ornamented with figures, very rudely executed, in bas-relief. Ancient Sepulchral Monuments. \u2014 The most ancient sepulchral monu ment which occurs in this county, is one recently discovered on the west side of Repton church yard, a figure of which is annexed. It much re sembles in form, and the style of its rude ornaments, the two stones in Penrith church-yard in Cumberland, forming part of the ancient monument called the \" Giant's grave ;\" and is no doubt to be referred to the period when the Saxon monastery existed at Repton. Of the ancient gravestones, without inscriptions, having crosses-floree, &c. engraved on them, many are to be seen in the Derbyshire churches ; in the porch of Darley church is one with a rich cross-floree, bugle horn, and sword d ; in the chancel of Stavely church, one with the cross-floree, and sword : another of the same kind over a window in the north aisle of Tarwich church ; in the chancel of Chellaston church, one with a cross floree and a chalice. Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries.\u2014 In the south transept of Darley church is the effigies of a crusader, with curled hair and beard, carved in stone, holding a heart in his hand ; at his feet is a large rose. In the middle ot' the chancel of Ilkeston church, is an altar-tomb with the effigies of a crusader, in stone, whose shield is charged with a fesse, Vaire, between three leopards' heads jessant des lys, reversed.

Under an ogee arch on the out side of the chancel of the same church, against the south wall, is the effigies of a crusader in stone, in mail and surcoat, with a large angular shield, and a lion at his feet. In the chancel of Norbury church is the effigies of a crusader, in the act of drawing his sword. On the floor of the chancel in Keddleston church, on removing two circular pieces of wood, about a foot below the surface, appear the head of a knight in mail armour, and that of his lady in veil and wimple ; sculptured in pretty high relief; part of their hands also appear joined in the attitude of praying : each of these sculptures is inclosed within a quatre foil. In the year 1810, the stones above being removed, it appeared that these quatrefoils, and the heads within them, were cut on a large grave stone, four feet wide and ten inches thick, without any inscription. In the nave of Brampton church is a very curious sepulchral monu ment, apparently of the thirteenth century, which was discovered more than a century ago, on digging a grave2, and is now placed upright against the wall of the nave. Within a quatrefoil at one end of the stone, is the upper part of a female figure, holding a heart in her hand % sculptured in bas-relief; at the other end, her feet and the lower part of her drapery appear, as through an oblong opening/ On one side of the quatrefoil, is a cross-floree. On the flat part of the stone this inscription appears, eut in very fair Lombardic capitals, \" Hie jacet Matilda le Cans, orate pro anima ef pat' nost'.c \" Though the inscription is perfect, it is un certain for whom this monument was designed : it seems probable, how ever, that it was a person of no less consequence, than Matilda the heiress of the barony of Cauz, who died in the eighth year of King Henry III. ; as there is reason to suppose, that Peter de Brampton, who then held the manor of Brampton, was her soil ; his grandson having assumed the name of De Caus. As the head-dress represented on this monument does not appear to be of so early a period as the beginning of the reign of King Henry III., it is not improbable that it might have been inscribed to her memory, several years after her death, by her son, or one of his descendants. 1 Bassano's Church Notes. > The arms of Caus were three hearts. \u00bb This mode of exhibiting parts of the figure, through quatrefoil openings, hardly occurs, we believe, except among the ancient gravestones of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire!

When we visited this ancient monument, in the year 1810, only part of one of them remained in its original position ; this was two feet six inches in height, and twenty inches in diameter at the top : the upper part, two feet six inches in length, had been broken off, and removed to the distance of several feet. The lower part of the other, which has also been removed from its socket, is four feet two inches in length, eighteen inches in diameter at the bottom, and fifteen inches and a half at the top. This ancient monument, which bears a good deal of re semblance to one of the same kind called the Bow-Stones, at no great dis tance from it (noticed in our account of Cheshire \u00b0), has received from the country people the appellation of Robinhood's Picking-rods. As double pillars appear among the earliest sepulchral monuments in the Christian cemeteries, it is not i probable that these rude monuments were erected to the memory of some illustrious person, in the Pagan times.

Ancient Castles. The only ancient castles in Derbyshire, of which any considerable re mains at present exist are those of Castleton and Codnor; that of Castleton was formerly known by the name of Peak Castle ; and is situated on the summit of a high rock, nearly over the entrance of the great cavern, and inaccessible except on one side. It appears to have originally con sisted of a plain wall enclosing an area of moderate dimensions, with two small towers on the north sides, and a keep near the south-west corner, being a square tower, measuring 38 feet 2 inches on the outside, and 21 feet 4 inches by 19 feet 3 inches within the walls. It is most probable that this fortress was erected by William Peverell, to whom the manor was given by William the Conqueror, though Mr. King, who has given a particular account of it in the sixth volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia q, supposes it to have been built during the Saxon Heptarchy : great part of the walls of the keep, and some remains of the other building are still existing. r Of Codnor Castle in the parish of Heanor, the ancient seat of the Grey family, there are considerable remains, part of which are now converted into a farm-house. There is a view of them, taken in 1727, in the first volume of Buck's Antiquities/ No part of the ancient castle of Bolsover at present exists ; the square castellated building with irregular turrets, now called Bolsover-castle ', was erected in the reign of James I. 1 P, 247\u2014 254. r There is a view of this castle in the first volume of Buck's Antiq. pi. jr.

The most remarkable ancient mansion in this county, in point of an tiquity and preservation is Haddon-hall, formerly the seat of the Vernon family, and now belonging to the Duke of Rutland, whose ancestor, Sir John Manners acquired it, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by a marriage with one of the coheiresses of Sir George Vernon. It is situated on an/ eminence above the river Wye, and consists of two courts of irre gular form, approaching to squares, and surrounded by suits of apart ments. The principal entrance is under a tower at the north-west corner of the lower court ; and there is another under a tower at the north-east corner of the upper court. This building has been erected at various periods, but no part of it appears to be of a later date than the middle of the sixteenth century. The chapel and hall are the most ancient parts, having been built by Sir Richard Vernon, who died in the year 1452. In the win dows of the chapel are considerable remains of painted glass, coeval with the building, and in one of them is the date of 1427/ One of the pillars between the nave and south aisle is much more ancient, being in the massy style which had fallen into disuse before the thirteenth century ; which indicates that it was built on the site of a chapel attached to a more ancient mansion, erected probably by the Avenells, who were predecessors of the Vernons ; there is also a font in the chapel in the same style. The hall, which is situated between the two courts, is about 35 feet by 28 within the screen, which separates it from the buttery and other offices ; over the door of the porch, are two shields of arms, one of them being the coat of Vernon (fretty), the other, those of De Pembruge (barry of six), which Sir Richard Vernon was entitled to, in right of his mother, the heiress of Sir Fulco de Pembruge, Lord of Tonge-castle in Shropshire. The whole of the lower court, and part of the upper, is in the style of architecture which prevailed in the early part of the sixteenth century, and was probably erected by Sir Henry Vernon, who flourished in the reign of King Henry VII. The old drawing-room, and the adjoining bed chamber and dressing-rooms, appear to have been fitted up, and were probably built by Sir George Vernon in the year 1 545 ; his arms with that date, the arms of King Henry VIII., and the plume of feathers, with the initials E. P. being carved in oak over the drawing-room chimney-piece. u The following is the inscription remaining in the east window, \" Orate pro ai'abus Ricardi Vernon et Jenette uxoris ejus quifecerunt an'o dni milessimo CCCCXXVJI. 11 The"], [344, "ccxxxviii DERBYSHIRE. The long gallery, no feet long, and 17 feet wide, which occupies the upper floor on the south side of the upper court was probably erected about the same time ; though the oak wainscotting is evidently more modern, having been erected by Sir John Manners who married the heiress of Sir George Vernon in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This wainscotting is enriched with Corinthian pilasters supporting arches, between which are shields of the arms of Manners empaling those of Vernon : the frieze is ornamented with boars' heads (the crest of Vernon), roses and thistles. The great bed-chamber appears to have been fitted up about the same time as the gallery, it has a deep cornice of plaster, with a frieze ornamented with boars' heads and peacocks ; and over the fire-place is a rude bas-relief in plaster of Orpheus charming the beasts. The chamber between this room and the gallery has a similar cornice and frieze. The principal apartments of Haddon-hall are hung with ancient arras, hanging loose over the doors, which are of the rudest workmanship. The tapestry of the great bed-chamber is comparatively modern, it is orna mented with flowers, &c. in a good taste, and figures of monkeys and pea cocks u on a white ground. The late Mr. King has given a detailed description of this building, in his paper on Ancient Castles, printed in the sixth volume of the Arch\u00e6 ologia x ; at the conclusion of which he observes, that \" nothing can convey a more complete idea of ancient modes of living, than is to be obtained on this spot. Many great dwellings, which formerly helped to present the same ideas, are now quite rased and gone ; and others are only heaps of ruins, so far maimed, that it requires much attention to make out or com prehend what they once were, or to understand any thing of their original plan :\" and that \" it is much to be wished, by every lover of antiquities, that this princely habitation may never come so far into favour as to be modernized ; lest the traces of ancient times and manners, which are now so rarely preserved in this country, any where, should be utterly lost also here.\" Another ancient mansion-house in this county, which has undergone no alteration since the time of its original erection, is Hardwick-hall, belonging to the Duke of Devonshire ; which exhibits a most complete specimen of the domestic architecture which prevailed, among the higher ranks, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and also of the furniture which was in use at that period.

The hall is hung with very curious tapestry which ap pears to be as ancient as the fifteenth century. On one part of it is a representation of bear-hunting, and in another of otter-hunting. In the chapel, which is on the first-floor, is a very rich and curious altar-cloth, 30 feet long, hung round the rails of the altar, with figures of saints under canopies wrought in needle-work. The great dining-room is on the same floor, over the chimney-piece of which are the arms of the Countess of Shrewsbuiy, with the date of 1597. The most remarkable apartments in this interesting edifice are the state room, or room of audience, as it is called, and the gallery : the former is 64 feet 9 inches by 33 feet, and 26 feet 4 inches high ; at one end of it is a canopy of state, and in another part a bed, the hangings of which are very ancient. This room is hung with tapestry on which is represented the story of Ulysses ; over this are figures, rudely executed in plaster, in bas-reliefj among which is a repre sentation of Diana, and her nymphs. The gallery is about 170 feet long, and 26 wide, extending the whole length of the eastern side of the house ; and hung with tapestry, on a part of which is the date of 1478. It is pro bable that this, as well as many other articles of the furniture of this man sion was removed from the old hall at Hardwick, or from Chatsworth when that splendid edifice was rebuilt a century ago/ At a small distance from Hardwick-hall, are considerable remains of a more ancient hall, which appears to have been a very magnificent edifice; and from the style of its architecture could not have been built any great length of time before the erection of the present mansion. It is now in a ruinous state, but one of the rooms remains entire, which is 55 feet 6 inches by 30 feet 6 inches, and 24 feet 6 inches high : it is floored with terras ; the sides are fitted up to a certain height with oak wainscotting ornamented with Ionic pilasters, over which are ornaments in plaster, consisting of two rows of arches. Over the large stone chimney-piece are colossal figures one on each side, in Roman armour, reaching to the cornice ; from which this room has obtained the appellation of \" The Giants' Chamber.\" \u00bb For some account of the portraits in Hardwick-hall, and other particulars, see p. 190 of .Parochial History.

The principal front of this house retains its original appearance, having projecting bows terminating in octagonal embattled turrets, and large transom windows. The inside has been modernized, but in one of the lower rooms taken out of the great chamber, is a very magnificent stone chimney-piece, enriched with fluted Doric pillars supporting statues of justice and religion, and coats of arms and various ornaments in bas-relief.

The buff coat, sword, &c. of Sir Francis Rodes, worn in the time of Charles I., are preserved in this house/ The manor-house of South-Winfield, a very splendid and spacious edifice, erected by Ralph Lord Cromwell, in the reign of King Henry VI., is now a mere ruin ; having been suffered to go to decay soon after the civil war in the seventeenth century, and a great part of it having been taken down since for the materials. It appears originally to have consisted of two courts, surrounded by buildings. The remains of the north side of the principal court, shew that when complete, it must have been a very beau tiful edifice : these consist of a porch, and a bow with three large Gothic windows, the arches of which are slightly pointed. The porch and bow window are both embattled, having a fascia of quatrefoils and roses running immediately beneath the battlements. The arch of the door-way of the porch is very slightly pointed, and enriched with quatrefoils ; on the bat tlement over it, is a shield with the arms of Cromwell/ z They are engraved in Grose's Ancient Armour, pi. xxxix. 1 For a more particular account of these remains see Blore's \" History of the Manor and Manor-house of South- Winfield,\" p. 86 \u2014 89.

The custom of rush-bearing, which we have mentioned in our account of Cheshire\", still prevails in the northern part of Derbyshire, bordering on Yorkshire and Cheshire. In Glossop church we observed, in 1810, one of the garlands carried before the rush-carts on these occasions, of very large dimensions, and richly ornamented with gilt paper and glass of various colours : and we were informed that the rush-bearing carts, were here usually very much decorated with garlands and plate. The ceremony of strewing the churches with rushes usually takes place on the day of the dedication of the church ; but in the Peak-Forest is always held on Mid summer-Eve/ The ancient custom of hanging up in the churches garlands of roses, with a pair of gloves cut out of white paper, which had been carried before the corpses of young unmarried women, at their funerals, still prevails in many of the parishes of the Peak. The country wakes which formerly prevailed generally throughout the kingdom, on the Sunday following the day of dedication, or the day of the saint to-whom the church was dedicated, are no where perhaps at present more generally observed than in some parts of this county, particularly the wapentake of Wirksworth ; where they last several days, during which a play is exhibited every evening, on a temporary stage erected in some con spicuous part of the village. We saw such an one at Brassington on the 27th of September, 18 10, on which the Cheats of Scapin was the play to be performed that evening ; another was preparing at Hognaston a few days afterwards for the comic opera of Love in a Village. Bulls and badgers, and sometimes bears, are baited at these wakes ; and we were informed that the persons, who keep the bears for that purpose, are still known here by the ancient appellation of Bearward. The desperate foot-ball contests which were formerly common at these wakes, Mr. Farey informs us, are now confined to the streets of All-Saints in Derby on Shrove-Tuesday/ There is an annual custom at Tissington, of dressing the wells or springs, in different parts of the village : these, on Holy-Thursday are adorned with flowers, arranged in various devices, and accompanied with inscriptions, by the persons on whose premises they are situated.

Little has been done, though much seems to have been intended, towards a topographical history of Derbyshire. Philip Kinder, a contem porary and friend of Selden, left behind him a preliminary discourse to a projected history of this county, treating briefly of the natural history, pro duce, rivers, inhabitants, &c. &c/ It appears, from a passage in this dis course, that he intended to treat of the towns, according to their propinquity and site between such and such rivers, to visit all the churches, to get a copy of what relates to this county in Domesday-book, to search the records of the Tower and elsewhere, &c. &c. The Reverend John Hieron, an eminent nonconformist divine, who died in 1682, made copious extracts from the Herald's visitations; and from records, particularly those at the Roll's chapel, relating to this county : col lected in a volume, now in the possession of Godfrey Meynell, Esq., of Langley-park. It is evident, by a note at the beginning of the volume, that he meditated a topographical history of the county. Mr. William Wolley wrote a brief topographical history of Derbyshire, brought down to the year 171 2, which remains in MS. In this work he was assisted by the collections of Mr. Samuel Sanders, of Little-Ireton, who was connected with his family by marriage. A copy of this MS. is in the possession of Mr. Adam Wolley of Matlock, and another among Dr. Pegge's collections. Mr. Gough informs us that Mr. Samuel Pegge, rector of Whittington, (afterwards Dr. Pegge,) was, in 1780, making collections for the history of Derbyshire. Dr. Pegge's collections, now in the Heralds' college, contain some local information, particularly relating to parishes in his immediateneigh bourhood, some pedigrees brought down to his own time, &c; but he appears to have made but little efficient progress towards a topographical history of the county. A sketch of the History of Bolsover and Peak Castles (1785), by Dr. Pegge, was published in Mr. Nichols's Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica ; and an Historical Account of Beauchief Abbey, by the same author, was published by Mr. Nichols in 1801, after his death. Thomas Blore, Esq., in 1791, announced his intention of publishing a topographical history of Derbyshire, and made considerable collections from public records and private evidences for that purpose : in the same year he communicated to the editors of \" Topographical Miscellanies,\" a History of \u00bb Now in MS. in the Ashmolean library at Oxford, Vol. V.

In 181 1, the Rev. D. P.

The chief sources whence we have derived our accounts of the descent of property in the following brief parochial history, are the records in the Tower, the Augmentation office, the Rolls chapel, the office of the duchy of Lancaster, and the Quo Warranto Roll. Some valuable information has been obtained from collections' taken by Dodsworth from records, not at pre sent in a state of arrangement for reference, in the Court of Exchequer ; from communications obligingly made by the principal landed proprietors, and their agents; and a most valuable and extensive collection, made during a course of several years, by Adam Wolley, Esq. of Matlock, from ancient family deeds and other sources ; from which he has favoured us with the most liberal communications.

We have, as in other counties, visited all the parish churches, and have been able to supply some notices of tombs now mutilated or removed, from a volume of church notes, taken about the year 17 10, by Francis Bassano, a herald-painter of Derby, which we purchased some years since, with a collection of Cheshire, MSS., and which it is our intention to deposit in the Heralds' college.

Alfreton"], [351, "DERBYSHIRE. 3 Alfreton, a small market-town in the hundred of Scarsdale, and in the deanery of Chesterfield, is situated 14 miles from Derby, about 12 from Chesterfield, and 142 from London. This town has been supposed to have derived its name from King Alfred, and tradition has assigned its building to that monarch. Camden has been quoted as concurring in this opinion, but he merely observes that such a tradition was current/ There is no doubt that some noble Saxon of the name of Alfred (a name not uncommon among the Saxons) was the pos sessor of Alfreton at a remote period, and that from him it was denomi nated \u00c6lfredingtune, as it is spelt in Ethelred's charter to Burton' abbey. There is nothing to appropriate it to King Alfred. In the Domesday Survey the Norman scribes have corrupted the name to Elstretune. Somercotes and Riddings, two hamlets or townships in this parish, main tain their own poor, and have separate highway rates. At Riddings there was formerly a chapel, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen. The market at Alfreton was granted, in 1251, to Robert de Latham and Thomas de Chaworth, to be held on Monday, together with a fair for three days at the festival of St. Margaret/ This charter was renewed to Thomas Babington of Dethick in 1551/ The market was changed from Monday to Friday in 1756, in consequence of the inhabitants of Higham having then revived an ancient market at that place. It is still held on Friday, as formerly, for corn, butchers' meat, &c. &c. The fair is now held on the 31st of July, for horses, horned cattle, &c. The manor of Alfreton was given by Wulfric, a noble Saxon, and con firmed by Ethelred II., to Burton abbey/ It had again passed into lay hands before the compilation of the Domesday Survey ; in which it is described as held by Ingram, under Roger de Busli. This Ingram was the imme diate ancestor of Robert Fitz-Ranulph or Fitz-Ralph, Lord of Alfreton, who founded Beauchief abbey in the reign of Henry II. His descendants were denominated de Alfreton. On the death of Thomas de Alfreton, his great grandson, in 1269, this manor descended to Thomas de Chaworth, his nephew, and Robert de Latham, who had married one of his sisters and co-heiresses.

William Chaworth, Esq. the last of this branch of the family, left an only daughter and heir in the reign of Hen. VII. married to John Ormond, Esq. whose heiress brought this manor to Sir Anthony Babington of Dethick. Henry Babington, Esq., the grandson, sold it in or about the year 1565 to John Zouch, Esq. of Codnor. The son of the latter conveyed it, in 161 8, to Robert Sutton, Esq. of Aram, in Nottinghamshire, by whom it was sold, in 1629, to Anthony Morewood, and Rowland, his son. The manor of Alfreton continued in the Morewood family, and the manor-house was their residence till the death of George Morewood, Esq. the last heir male, in 1792. His widow, who enjoys this estate under his bequest, married the Rev. Henry Case, who, in 1793, previously to his marriage, took the name of Morewood, by the King's sign manual. It appears that in the reign of Edward III., Thomas Chaworth claimed a park and right of free-warren at Alfreton, with the privilege of having a gallows, tumbrell, and pillory for the manor/ Dr. Pegge says, that Al freton was in ancient times esteemed a barony or honor. ' The manor or manor-farm of Ryddings, or Rydinge, (now Riddings,) was held, with Alfreton, by the Chaworth family m : it is now the property of Lancelot Rolleston, Esq. of Watnall, in Nottinghamshire. In the parish church of Alfreton is a brass tablet, in memory of John Ormond, Esq., who died in 1503, and Joan his wife, (the heiress of Chaworth,) who died in 1507. It appears by the inscription, that the daughters and co-heiresses of Joan Ormond, one of whom married Babington, had a right to quarter the arms of Chaworth, Caltoft, Brett, Aylesbury, Engayne, and Bassett of Weldon. There are the monuments also of Anthony Morewood, Esq., the purchaser of the estate, who died in 1636, and of George Morewood, Esq., the last of the family, who died in 1792. The church of Alfreton was given to Beauchief abbey by Robert Fitz ralph, the founder, and became appropriated to that monastery. The rectory of Alfreton, with the advowson of the vicarage, was granted by Henry VIII. to Francis Leake, Esq., whose descendant, Nicholas, Earl of Scarsdale, sold them, in 1673, to John Turner of Swanwick, Gent.

The manor of Appleby was given to Burton abbey * by Wulfric Spott, and was held under that monastery by the ancient family of Appleby, as early as the year 1166. Sir Edmund Appleby distinguished himself at the battle of Cressy. In Nicholas's Leicestershire is an inventory of the goods at his manor-house at Appleby. The last of the Appleby family died in 1636. Sir Wolstan Dixie purchased this manor of his co-heirs; and his son gave it to the grammar-school at Market-Bosworth, founded by his great uncle.

Ashborne, a considerable market-town in the wapentake of Wirksworth, and in the deanery to which it gives name, is situated 1 3 miles from Derby, and 139 from London, on the road to Manchester, from which it is 47 miles distant. The name of this town is spelt in ancient records Esseburne, Ashburne, and Ashbourn. Ashborne has long been the prevailing mode of spelling. We have not met with any charter for the market on record ; it certainly existed before the year 1 296 \u00b0 ; and was then held, as it still is, on Saturday ; there were then two fairs, each held for three days, at the festivals of St. Oswald and St. John the Baptist. Five fairs are enumerated in a charter of Charles I. These are now held on May 2 1st, July 5th, Aug. 1 6th, Oct. 20th, and Nov. 29th. There are also three fairs of more modern date, the first Tuesday after the 1st of January, Feb. 13th, and April 3d. The fairs are all for horses, horned cattle, and sheep. The fairs on Feb. 13th and Oct. 20th are particularly noted for the sale of horses and colts. The February fair begins for their sale two days before the date above-mentioned, and the October fair three days preceding. The fairs on April 3 d and May 21st are noted for the sale of milch cows ; the August and November fairs are chiefly for the sale of fat cattle ; wool is sold at the July fair, but it is esteemed the smallest fair in the year.

From this time it continued to be annexed to the earldom and duchy of Lancaster till the year 1633, when King Charles granted it to William Scriven and Philip Eden, who conveyed it to Sir John Coke, one of His Majesty's secretaries of state, and his son, John Coke, Esq. : from the latter it passed by sale to Sir William Boothby, Bart., then of Broadlow- Ash, in the parish of Ashborne. This manor was settled upon Brooke Boothby, Esq., a younger son, whose descendants inherited the title upon the extinction of the elder branch. It is now the property of Sir Brooke Boothby, Bart.

Even the site is not known ; brut it is supposed to have been at a place called Penter's-Lane, on the road from Ashborne to Derby. The manor of Sturston appears to have been inherited at an early period by the Knivetons from the Grendons, who had a grant of free warren in the reign of Henry III. In the year 1655 Sir Andrew Kniveton sold this manor to Francis Meynell, Alderman of London, from whom it descended to Godfrey Meynell, Esq. of Bradley, the present proprietor. John Walker, Esq. of Styd, claims also a manor in Sturston. The township of Yeldersley lies about two miles and a half south-east of Ashborne. The manor of Yeldersley (Geldeslei), which had been the joint property of Ulchetil and Godwin, was, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, held under Henry de Ferrars by Cole, whose son Robert con veyed it to Sewal de Mungei or Monjoy. This family possessed it for several generations, and from them it passed by inheritance, about the be ginning of the reign of Edward III., to the lrelands.1 The last men tioned family continued to possess it in the reign of Henry VII. It was soon afterwards in the Montgomerys, from whom it passed by marriage to the Vernons. This manor has belonged for more than a century to the Meynells of Bradley. The Shirleys from a very early period held this as a mesne manor under the Ferrars family, and afterwards under the Dukes of Lancaster, and it was held under them by the Monjoys aud their successors. The families of Whitehall, Pegge, and Lee of Ladyhole, all extinct, held considerable freehold estates in this township. The Whitehalls were settled here for several descents. The township of Broadlow or Bradley-Ash, which is partly within the parish of Thorpe, lies about three miles north of Ashborne.

Cold-Eaton, which lies about five miles north of Ashborne, was, at the time of the Domesday Survey, an appendage to the manor of Parwich. It was granted by King John to William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby. After the attainder of his great-grandson, it was given to Edmund, Earl of Lan caster. This manor was held under the Earldom and Duchy of Lancaster, from the beginning of Edward III.'s reign till the latter end of the reign of Edward IV., by the Wensley family. About the year 131 8 it appears to have belonged to the Vernons of Haddon, from whom the greater part descended to the present Duke of Rutland. A fourth part was many years in the Boothby family, and is now the property of Mr. Anthony Beresford of Castern. Newton-Grange, which is situated about four miles north of Ashborne, was one of the manors of Henry de Ferrars, at the time of the taking the Domesday Survey. His descendant Robert, Earl Ferrars, gave it to the abbey of Combermere, in Cheshire. King Henry VIII. granted it, with other possessions of that abbey, to George Cotton, Esq., from whose family it passed to that of Bentley, of Hungry Bentley in this county. A moiety of it was forfeited, by the attainder of Edward Bentley, Esq., in 1586. The other moiety had previously been sold to the Beresfords, who eventually became possessed of the whole, having purchased the forfeited moiety of Sir William Withipole, son-in-law of Sir Michael Stanhope, to whom it had been granted by Queen Elizabeth, after Bentley's attainder.

The manor of Alsop had previously passed into the Beresford family, a co-heiress of which brought it to the Milwards. It passed by successive sales in 171 1, 1753, &c. to Smith of Hopton, Pole of Nottingham, and Beresford of Basford ; and is now, by purchase from the late Francis Beresford, Esq. of Ashborne, the property of Mr. John Brownson of Alsop.

At an early period, the Fitzherberts of Norbury held a manor here under the Earls of Lancaster. In the reign of Edward III. it was conveyed to the Cokaines, whose descendant, Sir Edward Cokaine, sold it, in the early part of the seventeenth century, to Baptist Trott. The latter soon afterwards conveyed it to Thomas Levinge, Gent., great-grandfather of Sir Richard Levinge, Knt. and Bart, Speaker of the House of Commons, and Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, and ancestor of Sir Richard Levinge, Bart., of High-Park, in the county ofWest-Meath, by whom this manor was sold, in 1814, to William Evans, Esq. of Derby, the present proprietor. The mansion, formerly inhabited by the Levinge family, is now a farm-house. The paramount manor belonging to the duchy of Lancaster, having been granted by King Charles I. to Ditchfield and others, was purchased by the Levinge family, and sold with the other in 18 14, to Mr. Evans ; but the inhabitants of Parwich still continue to do suit and service to the duchy courts of Wirksworth ; at which the constables and headboroughs are sworn into their offices. In the chapel at Parwich is a tablet, in memory of William Beresford, who died in 1699. This gentleman charged certain lands with the payment of iol. per annum to the minister of Parwich chapel ; iol. per annum for the poor ; and 3I. per annum for the education of poor children. The Dean of Lincoln, or his lessee, pays a stipend of 20 nobles per annum to the minister of the chapel, who has of late years been appointed by the lord of the manor. Ashover, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, lies about four miles from Matlock, and six south-west of Chesterfield, which is the post-office town. It has a small market on Thursday, frequented, in the winter only, occasionally by a few butchers ; and two fairs, April 25 and October 15, for horned cattle and sheep. We have not found any charter for either. The parish, which is large, contains the township of Ashover, including the several villages of Alton, Butterley, High Oredish, Kelstedge, Mill-town, Northedge, Littlemoor, Overton, and Slack, all in the hundred of Scarsdale, and also the hamlets of Dethick, Lea \", and part of the villages of Upper and Nether Holloway, in the wapentake of Wirksworth.

(supposed to have been two younger sons of Earl Godwin,) and that at the time of making the survey it belonged to Ralph Fitzhubert, under whom it was held by Serlo. The posterity of this Serlo were called de Plesley, from Plesley, the place of their residence. Serlo de Plesley, his descendant, who died about the year 1203, left two daughters, co-heirs, married to AYilloughby of Lincolnshire and Deincourt, who possessed this manor in moieties. The coheiresses of Deincourt married Reresby of Lincolnshire, and Musters of Nottinghamshire. Sir Robert Willoughby, son of the coheiress of Plesley, exchanged his share of Ashover with the Reresby family for their interest in the Plesley estate. The share of Ashover manor, which belonged to the Musters' family, was subdivided between two sons, from one of whom, Geffrey, a portion of the manor passed to Robert Perpoynt. In the reign of Edward I., Adam de Reresby, Ralph de Reresby, Robert Perpoynt and Henry Musters, are stated in the Nomina Villarum to have been lords of Ashover. From this time Ashover appears to have been considered as divided into four distinct manors, known by the names of the New-hall manor, the Old hall manor, Musters' manor, and Perpoynt's manor, afterwards called Babington's, or Gorse-hall manor. The New-hall manor, with the advowson of the church, which had been given in 1302, by Margaret de Reresby, widow, to Adam de Reresby, her youngest son, and Dethgye, or Deugye, his wife, continued to belong to their descendants, who occasionally served the office of sheriff for the county, and resided at the manor-house, called the New-hall, and afterwards Eastwood hall, till the reign of James I., when Sir Thomas Reresby, by deed, made it over to trustees, to be sold for the purpose of paying his debts, and raising portions for his two daughters, and it was accordingly sold, with the advow son, in 1623, to the Rey. Immanuel Bourne, then rector of Ashover. The Rev. Lawrence Bourne, rector of Ashover, who died in 1797, bequeathed the manor of New-hall, or Reresby's manor, and the advowson of the rectory, to trustees for the benefit of his niece Jemima, the wife of Mr. John Nodder, since deceased, and her children, in whom it is now vested. Eastwood-hall, formerly the residence of the Reresby family, and the site of this manor, was sold in 1762 to the governors of Queen Anne's bounty, for the purpose of augmenting the chapel of Brimington, near Chesterfield. Part of the old mansion is standing and inhabited as a farm house. The Old-hall manor was conveyed by Ralph de Reresby, in 1337, to Roger, son of Robert de Wynfield, of Edelstow-hall, who purchased also the"], [365, "DERBYSHIRE. 17 the fourth share which had belonged to Henry Musters, since which period the Old Hall manor, and Musters's manor, have been united. The heiress of Ralph, son of Roger de Wynfield, brought these manors to Robert Plumley, who, dying without issue, they passed to James Rolleston, Esq. of Lea, in the parish of Ashover, whose great grandfather had married a daughter of Roger de Wynfield above-mentioned. These manors continued in the Rolleston family, till the Lea branch became extinct, about the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, when they passed by marriage, or settlement, to the Peshalls, or Pershalls of Horsley in Staffordshire. In the year* 1648, Sir John Pershall Bart, sold his manors of Ashover and Lea, to Richard Hodgkinson, and Giles Cowley of the former place, who soon afterwards sold Ashover in four shares : the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks is proprietor of one of these shares by inheritance from the Hodgkinsons : two others have been for a considerable time in the family of Bourne ; one of these is now vested in the Rev. Nicholas Bourne, the other in the representa tives of the late Rev. John Bourne of Spital : the remaining fourth belongs to the Marchioness of Ormond as representative of the Clarkes. Edelstow Hall seems to have been considered as the hall of this manor, to which it was attached, till after the sale by Sir John Pershall. .After this, it became the seat of a branch of the Gladwin family, one of whose co-heiresses brought it to Dr. Henry Bourne of the Spital, near Chesterfield. It was sold in 1808, by the widow of the Rev. John Bourne, and her daughters, to Mr. John Milnes of Ashover, the present proprietor. This hall is now occupied as a farm-house. Perpoynt's manor belonged, at a subsequent period, to the Babing tons of Dethick, of whom it was purchased by Sir Thomas Reresby, and sold with his other estates in Ashover : it is now generally called Babington's manor. Sir Joseph Banks has three-sevenths of this manor ; the Duke of Devonshire one-seventh ; Sir Henry Hunloke, Bart, one seventh ; the representatives of the late John Woodyer, Esq. of Crook hill near Doncaster, one-seventh : the remaining seventh is in severalties q. Gorse-hall, which is supposed to have been the hall of this manor, became, some years ago, the property of Mr. Thomas Bower, who resided in it ; his grandson, the late Mr. Samuel Bower of Chesterfield, devised it to trustees for his daughter, Mrs. Dutton.

In the year 1556, Thomas Hunt (son of Christopher, who had removed to Aston upon Trent) sold his estate at Overton to Richard Hodgkinson, then of Northedge-hall. After intermediate alienations to Calton and Wolley, it was re-purchased of the latter family, in 1641, by George Hodgkinson, great-great-grandson of Richard above-mentioned. The daughter and heiress of William Hodgkinson, Esq., (son of George) married Joseph Banks Esq., of Revesby Abbey, in the county of Lincoln. His son Robert, who took the name of Hodgkinson, died in 1792. On his death, this estate devolved to the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the much respected President of the Royal Society, who has generally since he became possessed of the estate, spent a few weeks in the autumn at Overton-hall. The garden at this place affords a singular curiosity in the growth of two gooseberry-trees, which, as the climate is unfavourable for the ripening of more valuable fruit, have been trained against the walls. One of these trees, the date of the planting of which is not known, measured in 1808, fifty-one feet two inches in length, (the eastern branch, twenty-eight feet seven inches ; the western, twenty-two feet seven inches) : the other tree, planted in 1794, measured, the same year, forty-one feet five inches in length : (the southern branch, twenty-one feet one inch ; the northern, twenty feet four inches.) The extreme length of the larger tree in 18 16, was fifty -four feet seven inches. The trees are of the smooth red, or Warrington sort, and are remarkably good bearers. A younger branch of the Hunts resided also at Overton, from about the year 1322, till the year 1596; when William Hunt sold his mansion and estate to Robert Dakin of Chelmorton by whom it was conveyed in 1600, to the ancestor and namesake of Mr. John Gregory the present proprietor and occupier. The ancient family of Crich, which had been for many generations resident in Ashover, had considerable estates at Butterley, Nether-Stubbing, Stubbing-edge, and Haughfield in this parish, most of which were purchased in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by William Crich, Gent., and sold in parcels by his great grandson, Adam, father of Cor nelius Crich, the last of the family, who died in very reduced circumstances at the great age of 101, in the year 1789, and lies buried in Ashover church. Till within a few months of his death he frequently attended Chesterfield market. Over-"], [367, "DERBYSHIRE. 19 Over-Stubbing or Stubbing-edge, which had belonged to the family of Crich, passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth to Richard Dakeyne, who married the widow of William Crich. He had no issue by this marriage, but by a former wife, Catherine Strange, daughter of the Earl of Rothes, and one of the favourite attendants of Mary Queen of Scots r, he had two sons. Henry Dakeyne his grandson sold Stubbing-edge-hall and estate, in 1 66 1, to William Michell, Esq., of Wingerworth. The heiress of Michell brought it to Sir John Phelippes, Bart., of whom the mansion and a part of the estate, were re-purchased by Arthur Dakeyne, Esq., son of Henry. This estate passed with his heiress in marriage to Captain William Hopkinson, of Bonsall ; and after having passed through several hands, is now the property and residence of Mr. George Allen. Northedge-hall was formerly the property of a family, who took their name from the place of their residence. It was sold by Godfrey North edge, in the year 1591 ; and having undergone some intermediate alien ations, was purchased, in 1603, by Mr. Robert Newton of Higham, in the parish of Shirland, ancestor of John Newton, Esq., of King's Bromley, near Lichfield, who died without issue in 1783. It is now the property of Mr. John Nuttall of Matlock, who purchased it in 1804, of the widow of the Rev. John Arden, devisee of Mr. Newton. The hall is occupied as a farm-house. An estate, called Buntingfield, in this parish, furnishes a remarkable instance of well ascertained long continuance in a family of yeomanry, it being known to have belonged to an ancestor and name-sake of its pre sent proprietor, Mr. John Bunting, in the reign of Edward III.

It has since passed with the Haddon estate, and is now the property of the Duke of Rutland. j^oor-hall, said to have been an ancient seat of the Gernons, stood about a mile west of Bakewell, on the edge of the moors. In the parish church, which is an ancient and spacious structure, exhibit ing the architecture of various periods5, are the monuments of Sir Thomas Wendesley or Wensley, mortally wrounded, whilst fighting on the side of the House of Lancaster, at the battle of Shrewsbury' ; Sir John Vernon, Knt. (son and heir of Henry) 1477 ; Sir George Vernon, of Haddon, who died in 1 56 1, and his two wives, Margaret daughter of Sir Gilbert Talbois, and Maud, daughter of Sir Ralph Longford ; Sir John Manners (second son of Thomas Earl of Rutland) who died in 161 1, and his wife (Dorothy, daugh ter and co-heir of Sir George Vernon) who died in 1584; John Manners, (third son of Sir John) who died in 1590, and Sir George Manners, who died in 1623. He married Grace, daughter of Sir Henry Pierrepont. There are memorials also for Basset Copwood, maternally descended from the Bassets of Blore, who died at Bubnell Hall, in 1628, and the Walthalls de scended from the family of that name at Wistaston, in Cheshire, 1744, &c. In the south isle is an ancient monument for Sir Godfrey Foljambe, who died in 1376, and Avena his wife, who died in 1383. The inscription on the tablet was written by Mr. Blore, and put up in the year 1803. In Bassano's volume of church notes are recorded the memorials of Latham VVoodroffe, Esq. 1648, William Saville, Esq. 1658, both stewards to John Earl of Rutland ; and Bernard Wells, Gentleman, of Holme-hall, 1653. The parish of Bakewell is stated in the Domesday Survey to have had two priests. King John, in the first year of his reign, granted the church of Bakewell, then collegiate, with its prebends and other appurtenances, to the canons of Lichfield, to whom it was afterwards appropriated. At the time of King John's grant, there were three officiating priests in this church, for whom a competent maintenance was stipulated, and one of the prebendaries of Lichfield was, in consequence of the above-mentioned grant, to say mass for the souls of the King and his ancestors, in Lichfield s See the account of Ancient Church Architecture. 1 See the account of Ancient Sepulchral Monuments.

The prebends of Bakewell were three in number ; Matthew, a canon of Lichfield, being the incumbent of one of these, was allowed by the dean and chapter to retain it during his life. x In consequence of a complaint, which came before John Peckham, Arch bishop of Canterbury, at his visitation of the diocese of Lichfield, that the deacon and sub-deacon of the rich church of Bakewell were so ill provided for, that they were obliged to beg their bread; it was ordained by the Archbishop in 1280, that they should eat at the vicar's table, and that for the extraordinary expence, ten marks per annum should be allowed him out of the rectory, in addition to twenty marks which he before re ceived ; and it is observed, that he had already two priests and the clerk to maintain. A mark was allowed to the deacon, and ten shillings to the sub-deacon, for clothes y. The dean and chapter of Lichfield are still patrons of the vicarage of Bakewell, which is in their peculiar jurisdiction. Before the reformation there were two chantries in Bakewell church, one at the altar of the Holy Cross, founded in 1365, by Sir Godfrey Fol jambe, and Avena, his wife, valued at 61. 6s. 2d., 1 Edward VI. ; the other at the altar of the Virgin Mary, valued at 4I. The hospital of St. John at Bakewell was founded by Sir John Manners and his brother Roger Manners, Esq. of Uffington in Lincolnshire, for six poor men who were made a body corporate, and endowed in 1602, at the expence of 600I. with annuities or rent-charges to the amount of 40I. per annum. The poor men have pensions of 61. per annum each, the remain ing four pounds are appropriated to a laundress : Sir John Manners left by will (161 1) the sum of 30I. to purchase pewter, brass, and linen, for the use of the hospital. Grace Lady Manners (widow of Sir George Manners, who died in 1623,) in the year 1636, founded a free-school for instructing the poor children of Bakewell and Great-Rowsley in reading, writing, &c. and endowed it with a rent-charge of 15I. per annum, issuing out of lands at Elton. Over-Haddon is within the King's manor of the High-Peak, but there is within it a subordinate manor, which with Over-Haddon-hall, in the reign of Henry VI., became the property and seat of a younger branch of the Suttons, of Sutton in Cheshire, who continued there for five gene rations.

It is said that she began to abstain from food on the 2 2d of December 1667, being then in her eighteenth year, in consequence of the effects of a blow received some years before, but her illness is said not to have commenced till the end of August, or the beginning of Sep tember preceding. The last pamphlet was published March 30, 1669, when it appears that she was living and continuing to fast ; her face is described as plump and ruddy; her pulse as even and lively; it is said that after she had left off eating, she once swallowed part of a fig, which had nearly proved fatal to her ; that she had none of the usual secretions after the beginning of 1668 ; nor was there any moisture in her mouth or nose ; that the vertebrae of her back might be felt through the abdomen ; that she' had very little sleep, and was once wholly without sleep for five 2 The titles of the pamphlets are as follow : \" Newes from Derbyshire, or the Wonder of all Wonders, that ever yet was printed, being a relation of the handy work of Almighty God, shewn upon the body of one Martha Taylor, living about a mile or something more from Bakewell, in Derbyshire, hard by a pasture, commonly called Hadon pasture: this maid as it hath pleased the Lord, she hath fasted forty weeks and more, which may very well be call'd a wonder of all wonders, though most people who hear this may censure this to be some fable, yet if they please but to take the pains to read over the book, I hope that they will be better satisfied, and have some faith to believe.

It appears that she underwent two watches, having been attended by from forty to sixty women, who watched her strictly night and day. One of these watches was appointed by the neighbouring townships ; the other by the Earl of Devonshire. If the entry copied in the note a, records the burial of this young woman, she survived the publication of the last pamphlet fifteen years. We have no account of the sequel, whether she was detected as an impostor, or whether she was a real sufferer, and, having recovered, returned to her usual habits. It is probable that some of these pamphlets might have fallen into the hands of the late notorious impostor Ann Moor, and suggested the lead ino- circumstances of her impositions. This woman, who is a native of Derbyshire b, resided at Tutbury, where, during a pretended fasting 01 more than four years, she contrived that her case should in almost every particular resemble that of Martha Taylor. Having successfully eluded one watch of seventeen days and nights, she continued her imposture with the greater confidence ; till at length, having reluctantly submitted to a second ordeal, it was conducted with so much care and skill, that she found it impossible to elude the vigilance of the watchers : and at length, when nature was almost exhausted with real fasting, she confessed herself an impostor. The manor of Nether-Haddon belonged at an early period to the family of Avenell, whose co-heiresses married Vernon and Basset. The heiress of Vernon, in the reign of Henry the Third, married Gilbert Le Francis, whose son Richard took the name of Vernon and died at the age of 29 in 1296. This Richard was common ancestor of the Vernons of Haddon, Stokesay, Hodnet, Sudbury, &c. The Bassets continued to possess a moiety of Nether-Haddon in the reign of Edward III., but in or before the reign of Henry VI. the whole became vested in the Vernons, who had purchased Basset's moiety. Sir Richard Vernon of Haddon was speaker of the Parliament held at Leicester in 1425 ; his son of the same name was the last person who held for life the high office of Constable of England. Sir Henry Vernon, grandson of the latter, was Governor to Prince Arthur, son of Henry VIII. who is said to have resided with him at Haddon. The Haddon branch of the Vernons became extinct in 1565, by the death of Sir George Vernon, who, by the magnificence of his retinue and his great hospitality, is said to have acquired the name of \" King of the Peak.\" Dorothy, the younger of his co-heiresses, brought \" \" June 12, 1684.

The ancient castellated mansion of Haddon-hall, exhibits the architecture of various periods c, having been built at several times by the families of Vernon and Manners. The general appearance of this ancient mansion, with its turrets, surrounded by woody scenery, is very picturesque. The gallery in the south front, about no feet in length, and only 17 in width\", was built in the reign of Elizabeth. The great hall was the ancient dining-room. Most of the other apartments, which are numerous, are of small dimensions. About the year 1760, the house was entirely stripped of its furniture, which was removed to Belvoir Castle e, but the building is still kept in good repair. The Rutland family have not resided at Haddon since the reign of Queen Anne, when the first Duke lived there occasionally in great state, and is said to have kept his Christmas with open house, in the true style of old English hospitality f. A ball was given in the gallery by the Duke of Rutland on occasion of his coming of age, and another by the inhabitants of Bakewell, on occasion of the peace of 1802.

The manor of'Harthill or Herthill commonly called and spelt Hartle, be longed at an early period to the family of de Herthill, whose heiress brought it, with several other estates, to the Cokaines in the reign of Edward III. Edward Cokaine, Esq. sold Herthill, in the year 1599, to John Manners, Esq. from whom it has descended to his Grace the Duke of Rutland. There was formerly a chapel at Herthill, in which a chantry was founded in the year 1259, by Richard de Herthilf. The minister of the chapel was appointed and supported by the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield^. There are no remains of the chapel at Harthill. The manor of Hassop was formerly in the Foljambes. The heiress of Sir Godfrey Foljambe brought it, in the fourteenth century, to Sir Robert Plumpton, of Yorkshire. Sir Robert his grandson sold Hassop in 1498, to Catherine, widow of Stephen Eyre of this place, a younger son of Eyre of Padley. Francis Eyre, Esq., the immediate descendant of Stephen, on the death of the late Earl of Newburgh, in 18 14, assumed that titleh, and is the present proprietor. Hassop Hall was garrisoned for the King, by Colonel Eyre, in the month of December 16431. There is a portrait at Hassop, (now the seat of his descendant the Earl of Newburgh,) of this gallant royalist, who distin guished himself at the siege of Newark ; besides others of the Eyre family, and that of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. The village of Ashford, the Aisseford of the Domesday Survey, is situ ated on the banks of the Wye, about two miles from Bakewell. The manor, which was parcel of the ancient demesnes of the crown, was granted by King John in the first year of his reign, to Wenunwen, Lord of Powisland\", whose son Griffin, had a grant of free- warren in this manor in the year 1250'. King Edward the Second granted it in 13 19, to his brother Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of Kentm. This manor having descended to the posterity of Joan his daughter, (and eventually heiress,) by her second husband Sir Thomas Hol land, passed, on the death of Edmund Holland Earl of Kent, in 1408, to Elizabeth his sister and co-heiress married to John Lord Neville.

The moiety which had belonged to Rufford Abbey, was granted by King Henry VIII. to George, Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1628, it was conveyed by the co-heiresses of Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury, to Sir William Armine and his lady. In 1658, Lady Armine sold it to the Bradshaws, of whom it was pur chased in 1662, by the Earl of Devonshire. It is now the property of his descendant, the Duke of Devonshire. In the chapel at Ashford is a tablet in memory of Mr. Henry Watson of Bakewell, who died in 1786, aged 72. It appears by his epitaph, that he established the marble works n near this place, and was the first who formed into ornaments the fluors and other fossils of this county0. There are memorials also for William Fynney of Little Longston, Gent. 1748 ; William Bullock of Ashford, M.D. 1784, and the Rev. John Bullock 1789.

Bubnell is now considered as part of the manor of Baslow, belonging to the Duke of Rutland. Bubnell-hall, formerly a seat of the Bassets of Blore, and afterwards, by marriage, of Copwood, is now a farm-house. The patronage of the parochial chapel of Baslow, which had belonged to the vicar of Bakewell, was by an act of parliament, passed in 1 8 1 1 , vested in the Duke of Devonshire and his heirs. s There is a charity school at Baslow, with an endowment of about 1 81. per annum, arising from sundry small benefactions. The manor of Calver, which belonged in the reign of Henry VI. to Thomas Lynford, was granted by King Henry VIII. to Rowland Shakerley, and having passed to the Tracys, was conveyed to the Stratfords, and afterwards purchased, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by the Eyres of Hassop, in which family it still remains. The townships of Curbar, Froggatt, and Rowland, lie within this chapelry ; the two former are in the manor of Baslow ; Rowland is a manor belonging to the Earl of Newburgh. The village of Beeley (the Begelie of Domesday) lies about four miles from Bakewell. The manor was in the Crown at the time of the Domes day survey. In the reign of Richard I. it belonged to Warner de Beelegh, who was succeeded by his son Serlo. At a later period, it was in the family of Cheney of Northamptonshire, whose heiress married Thomas Lord Vaux of Harrowden, in the reign of Henry VIII. Nicholas Vaux Esq., his younger son, having succeeded to his mother's estate, sold it in 1560, to Dean and John Greaves. The ancestors of the latter had re sided at a place called the Greaves in this chapelry, as early as the reign of Henry III. William Saville Esq., purchased it of the Greaves family in 1687.

The parochial chapelry of Buxton, (anciently written Bawkestanes u,) well known for its celebrated baths, is situated about 34 miles from Derby, 12 from Bakewell, about 22 from Manchester, and about 160 from London. The manor of Buxton is parcel of the King's manor of the High-Peak, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. The baths at Buxton are supposed to have been known to the Romans. It appears by Dr. Jones's treatise on the Buxton waters, published in 1572, that the waters were then in high repute, and that Buxton was a place of considerable resort. The great hall w for the accommodation of visitors had been erected not long before by the Earl of u Temp. Hen. III. It seems probable that it was originally Badestanes, deriving the name from its stone baths, and that it has been corrupted in the same manner as Bakewell. See p. 24. w The great hall is thus described by Dr. Jones : \" Joyninge to the chiefe springe betwene the river and the bathe, is a very goodly house, foure square, foure stories hye, so well compacte with houses of office beneath, and above, and round about, with a great chambre and other goodly lodgings to the number of 30 : that it is and will be a bewty to beholde, and very notable for the honorable and worshipfull that shall neede to repaire thither, as also for other.

Lodge's Illustrations, vol. ii. p. 1 1 1 . The Queen of Scots was at Buxton again in 1576. Ibid. ii. 149. In a letter to Lord Burleigh without date, which was written after her second visit to Buxton alluding to some false reports which had been made to the Queen, the Earl of Shrewsbury says, \" Touching the doubtfullnes her Matc shuld have of me in gyvyng the Scotes Q. lybarte to be sene & saluted ; suerly my L. the reportars thereof to her Matc hathe done me grete wronge: In dede at her fyrst beinge there, ther hapenyd a pore lame crepell to be in the lowar . . . . unknowne to all my pepell that garded the plase, and whan she hard that there was women in the ... . she desiered some good gentylwoman to gyve her a smoke ; wherupon they putt one of ther smokes out of a hole in the walle to her, & so soone as it came to my knolege, I was bothe offended w' her, & my pepell for takeyng any lettarr unto her ; and after that tyme I toke such ordaras no pore pepell cam unto the house during that tyme ; nether at the seconde tyme was ther any strangar at Buxtons (but my one pepell) that sawe her, for that I gave such charge to the contrey about, none should come in to behold her.\" Ibid. vol. ii. p. 247. F 2 In"], [384, "DERBYSHIRE. 36 and Burleigh among the noble visitors at Buxton.\" About the year 1670, the old hall was taken down, and a more commodious edifice In 1580, we find that the Earl of Shrewsbury went to Buxton a third time with his charge. The Earl, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, dated Aug. 9, 1580, says, \" I cam heddar to Buxtons w' my charge, the 28 of July. She hadde a harde begynnenge of her jorney ; for whan she shuld have taken her horse, he started asyde, & therwith she fell and hurte hur bake, wch she still complaines off, nottwithstanding she applyes the bathe ons or twyse a daye.

The remainder of this letter complains of an abatement of the allowance \u2022 for the Queen of Scots provision, by which it seems that, besides the many inconveniences and distresses which attended his odious and burdensome office, he was incur ring a considerable pecuniary loss. It appears that the Earl of Shrewsbury was at Buxton again with his illustrious charge in 1582, (Ibid, ii 271.) and this seems to have been the Queen of Scots last visit to Buxton. y We find that in 1576, the Queen so ordered her progress, that she might remain 21 days within sufficient distance of Buxton for the Earl of Leicester to have the Buxton waters brought to him daily, the physicians having resolved that wheresoever the Earl of Leicester was \" he must drynke and use Buxtons water 20 dayes together.\" (Lodge's Illustrations, vol. ii. p.150. ) In 1577 the Queen writes a letter of thanks to the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury, for accommodating the Earl of Leicester with lodgings at Buxton, discharging his diet, and presenting him with a very rare present. It appears that Lord Burleigh had been at Buxton, (probably more than once,) before 1573. (See Lodge, vol. ii. p. 109). He was there again in 1575, when Queen Elizabeth became jealous of him, (though her favorite and trusty minister) as favoring the Queen of Scots, and supposed that the reason of his going thither was, that he might the more readily hold intelligence with her by means of the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury. Ibid. vol. ii. p. 131. In 1577, he went again to Buxton with the Queen's permission. Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, is a letter from Lord Burleigh to the Earl of Sussex, Lord Chamberlain, who, it appears, had recently been at Buxton, the letter being dated \" From Buxton in your chamber,\" July 31, 1577. The following is an extract: \" Your Lordship, I think, desyreth to heare of my estate, which is this; I cum hither on Sunday last at night, took a small solutive on Monday ; began on Tuesday, yesterday I drynk of the water to the quantity of 3 pynts at 6 draughts ; this day I have added two draughts, and I drynk 4 pynts, and to-morrow am determyned to drynk 5 pynts, and mixt with sugar I fynd it potable with plesure even as whey.

Fitzwilliam, Thomas Cecil!, my Lady Harrington, Mr. Edmunds with sondrye others. The wether is dry, but yet cold with wynds.\" By a letter from the Earl of Sussex, dated Aug. 7. 1582, it appears that the Buxton water was by some drank in still larger quantities than Lord Burleigh used it. \" The water,\" says he \" I have drunke liberally, begynning wth thre pynts, and so encreasyng dayly a pynt I come to 8 pynts, & from thens descendyng dayly a pynt till I shall ageyne reterne to 3 pynts, wch wil be \u2022n Thursdye next, and then I make an ende.''

The baths, five in number, (two of which are private) are enclosed within this build ing. The water is drank at a spring called St. Anne's well, where is a small pump-room. The crescent, in which are three hotels, with the ball-room, &c. &c. was built at the expence of the late Duke of Devonshire, in the years 1785 and 1786. Near it are extensive stables, enclosing a circular area of 60 yards diameter, and coach-houses capable of containing about three score carriages. . A privilege which Dr. Jones suggested more than two centuries ago z as a great advantage to the place, was obtained in the year 1813, by the grant of a weekly market on Saturday, at Buxton, and four fairs, February 3, April 1, May 2, and September 8.a The market is for corn and provisions, the fairs for cattle, &c. There is a fund at' Buxton, raised chiefly by a small subscription from the company, for the support of poor persons resorting thither for the benefit of the waters, such persons having brought with them certificates from their parish ministers and medical attendants, of their being proper objects of the charity. It is supported by the contribution of one shilling each, paid by all visitors on their arrival, the. collections at two sermons, and casual dona tions. The funds of course vary, but 340I. have been collected from these sources, and above 430 pauper patients have received the benefit of the waters during the season : it appears from Dr. Jones's \" Buxtones Bathes Benefyte\" already quoted, that in 1572, there was a fixed rate to be paid by all persons resorting to the waters towards a fund, one half of which was for the physician, the other for the benefit of poor bathers. \" Alway provyded the day of your coming thither bee noted before you enter into the bathes and the day of your departure, with the country of your habitation, condition, or calling, with the infirmityes or cause you came for, in the regyster booke kept of the warden of the bath or the physition, that there shall be appointed, and the benefite you receyved, pay ing foure-pence for the recording, and every yeoman besides 1 2 pence, every gentleman 3 shillinges, every esquior 3s. 4d. ; every knight 6s. 8d., every lord and baron iosh., every vicount 13s. 4d., every erle 2osh., every marques 30SI1., every duke 3I. 10s., every archbishop 5I., every bishop 40s., every judge 20s., every doctour and sergeant of lawe 10s. 1 See the note in the preceding page. a When either of these days shall happen on Sunday, the fair will be on the Saturday preceding. every"], [386, "DERBYSHIRE. 38 every chauncellor and utter-barrister 6s. 8d., every archdeacon, prebendary, and canon 5s., every minister i2d., every ducches 40s., every marquesses 20s. every countes, 13s. 4d., every barones 10s., every lady 6s. 8d. every gentle woman 2s. and al for the treasure of the bath, to the use of the poore that only for help do come thither, the one halfe : the other to the physicion, for his residence.\" In the old chapel at Buxton are a few monuments of modern date, among which, is.that of the Honourable Robert Hamilton Lindsey, 1801. In 1728, John Needham gave 200I. in aid of Queen Anne's bounty to augment the income of the minister. It was customary for several years to have divine service performed in the long-room at the hotel, for the accommodation of the company resorting to Buxton, by the minister or some person appointed by him. A new chapel has been lately erected, not far from the stables, in the parish of Hope : it was opened for divine service on the 9th of August, 1 8 12. By the act of 51 George III., the patronage of this chapel and that of Baslow is given to the Duke of Devonshire ; and in lieu of this patronage, lands of the value of 95I. per annum, and the patronage of the vicarage of Tutbury in Staffordshire, are given to the vicar of Bakewell. There are meeting-houses at Buxton for the Independents, and for the Wesleyan Methodists. The charity-school was founded in 1674 by subscription, and is endowed with the greater part of the rent of lands now let at 59I. 9s. 6d. per annum.1 The township of Chelmorton, is esteemed parcel of the King's manor of the High-Peak b, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. The Talbot family had a subordinate manor in Chelmorton, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth in which they were succeeded by the Eyres of Hassop ; it is now the pro perty of the Earl of Newburgh. In the chapel are memorials of Edward Brereton, Gent. 1680, George Dale of Flagg, 1683, &c. There was a chapel at Chelmorton as early as the year 1282, at which time, the prior of Lenton in Nottinghamshire had two-thirds, and the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield the remainder of the tithes. The prior and the dean and chapter were bound to provide, jointly, books and ornaments for the chapel ; and the dean and chapter a priest, with a stipend of five marks.' The Duke of Devonshire was impropriator in 1805 ; an act of parliament a The principal benefactors were the Earl of Devonshire (50L), Mr. Richard Holland of Bristol (iool.), and Mr. Henry Wilshaw 80I. The lands purchased were then of the value of 15I. out of which 12I. was allotted for the master of a grammar school. As the remainder was appropriated in specific sums, (50s. for repairing a highway, and 10s. for a dinner for the trustees,) the income of the school has risen in proportion to the value of the land. b The village lies about eight miles from Bakewell. c Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. iii. p. 227. passed"], [387, "DERBYSHIRE. 39 passed that year for inclosing lands in the townships of Chelmorton and Flagg, by which allotments were assigned in lieu of tithes.

There is a charity school at Chelmorton, to which Mr. Brocklehurst, who died in 1792, gave the sum of 200L, vested in the commissioners for the Leak and Buxton road ; but it has produced no interest for many years ; and the master has no other benefit than the use of the house in which he resides. Great-Longesdon or Longstone, called in old ecclesiastical records Langedon, and in the survey of Domesday, Longesdune, lies about four miles from Bakewell. Great-Longstone is parcel of the manor of Ashford. The family of Wright have been possessed of the principal part of the landed pro- perty of this township, ever since the reign of Edward III. This estate, with Longstone-hall is still the property of their descendant, John Thomas Wright, Esq. of Exeter. The hall is occupied by Major Carleil. The family of Rouland or Roland had a house and lands at Great-Longesdon in the fourteenth century, which passed by marriage to the Staffords of Eyam. In the Rolls of Parliament, we find Godfrey Rouland, who styles himself \" un pauvre & simple Esquyer\" praying \" convenable et hasty remedy\" against Sir Thomas Wendesley, John Dean vicar of Hope, and others, who are stated to have come to the petitioner's house at Longcsdon with force and arms, to have carried off goods and stock to the value of 200 marks, to have taken the petitioner prisoner, and carried him to the castle of the High-Peak, where he was kept in custody six days, without victuals or drink; after which, they are stated to have cut off his right hand, and then to have released him.0 In 1282, the minister of Longstone-chapel was supported jointly by the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield and the inhabitants.\" Rowland Eyre, Esq., in 1628, gave a rent charge of il. per annum, to this chapel. The vicar of Bakewell appoints the minister. The sum of 5I. per annum for the education of 10 poor children in this chapelry, given by William Wright, Esq. in 1656, is payable out of the Longstone-hall estate.

The townships of Great and Little-Longstone and Wardlow d, have been inclosed pursuant to an act of Parliament passed in 18 10, by which allot ments were given in lieu of tithes to the vicars of Bakewell and Hope. The manor of Little-Longstone was held at the time of taking the Domesday survey by Colne under Henry de Ferrars. Robert Fitz-waltheof next occurs on record as Lord of Little-Longsdon, but the exact date of his possessing it is not known. In the reign of Edward I., it was in the family of Monjoy, from whom it passed by inheritance to the Blounts. Sir Walter Blount, Lord Monjoye, died seised of it in 1474/ The family of Edensor had a mesne manor held under the Monjoys, which manor appears to have devolved in 1403, to Thurston Boure, as heir to Isabel wife of Robert Staunton, and Agnes the wife of Nicholas Clerke/ The manor of Little-Longstone appears to have been afterwards in the Shakerleys, of whom it was purchased in the reign of Queen Elizabc 1 by the Countess of Shrewsbury. It is now by inheritance from the Countess, the property of the Duke of Devonshire. The Countess of Shrewsbury's alms-house at Derby is endowed with a rent-charge of iool. per annum, issuing out of this manor.

In the year 1640, Philip Earl of Pembroke being possessed of two of these shares, sold them to John Shallcross, Esq., who, in 1646, re sold them to Thomas Gladwin of Tupton-hall. The grand-daughters and coheiresses of Gladwin, brought this estate in moieties to Sir Talbot Clerke and Dr. Henry Bourne. In 1721, the Clerkes sold one third of this manor, and Dr. Bourne in 1736 another third to Edward Cheney, Esq. In 1735, Mr. Cheney had purchased the remaining third of John Gilbert, Esq. of Locko. Mr. Gilbert possessed it by devise from the Savilles, who had pur chased it in 1638 of Henry Earl of Kent. The manor of Monyash is now the property of Robert Cheney, Esq. a Major-General in His Majesty's service. In the chapel at Monyash, are memorials of Thomas Cheney, Esq., of Ashford, 1723, (father of Edward Cheney, Esq. before-mentioned) and the families of Sheldon and Palfreyman. Monyash chapel was originally founded as a chantry-chapel, about the year 1200, by Robert de Salocia and Matthew de Eston, who endowed it with lands for the celebration of divine service on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.11 In the year 1280, Archbishop Peckham ordained, that in addition to the lands given by the inhabitants at the foundation of the chapel, they should add one mark, and that the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield should pay the remainder.1 The chantry Roll of 1 Edw.

Griffin, son of Wenonwyn, alienated it in the reio-n of Henry III. to Geoffrey de Pickeford\": it was afterwards re-united to Ashford. The minister of the chapel is appointed by the vicar of Bakewell, to which church it is a chapel of ease. Mary Frost, who died in or about the year 1754, gave the interest of iool. four per cents, for apprenticing a poor child of this hamlet. The chapel of Taddington lies about six miles from Bakewell. William de Hamelton died seised of a third part of the manor of Taddington in the year 1286.0 It is now considered as parcel of the King's manor of the High- Peak on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. The minister of the chapel is ap pointed by the vicar of Bakewell. The Reverend Roger Wilkson of Priestcliffe in this chapelry, in the year 1 7 14, gave the sum of 400I. for a charity school, which having been laid out in land, is now let for about Sol. per annum. It was given for the education of all founders-kin in the chapelry of Taddington, or in the parishes of Bakewell or Tideswell ; and for ten other children of the town ships or hamlets of Priestcliffe, Taddington, Blackwall, and Brushfield. In consequence of the trust not having been renewed, the affairs of the charity are in chancery; and the master being a descendant of the founders, to whose kin a preference was given, enjoys the profits of the estate as a sinecure. Martha and Alice White, in 1804, gave 15I. per annum for teaching 12 poor children of this chapelry. The manor of Blackwall, a township in this chapelry, was given to the Priory of Lenton in Nottinghamshire by William Peverell p, in the reign of Henry I. It appears by Pope Nicholas's Valor, that this manor consisted of four oxgangs of land, then valued at il. 5s. per annum.

Barlborough, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, is situated seven miles and a half N. E. of Chesterfield. The manor of Barlborough (Barleburh) was given to Burton Abbey by Wulfric Spott. Before the conquest it had reverted to lay hands ; in the Domesday survey it is described as having belonged to Levenot, and being then the property of Ralph Fitzhubert, under whom it was held by Robert. This Robert was most probably ancestor of Robert de Meinell, one of whose coheiresses brought Barlborough to Sir Matthew de Hathersage. The coheiresses of Hathersage brought it in moieties, about the latter end of Henry the Third's reign to Goushill and Longford. These families held the manor in moieties for several generations. Anthony Wingfield who had married a coheiress of Sir Robert Goushill suffered a recovery in 1513/ Thomas Earl of Derby died seised of a manor in Barlborough, which appears to have been this moiety in 1521 ; Edward Stanley, Lord Monteagle, his uncle* in 1523 ; Sir William Holies, sometime Lord Mayor of London, died seised of a manor in Barlborough (which seems to have been this moiety) in 1542. Queen Mary, in 1554, granted to Dame Anne Stanhope the manor of Barlborough s, which had belonged to the Earl of Derby : Sir Thomas Stanhope sold this manor, in 1571, to Sir Richard Pype, who died seised of it, with the advowson of the rectory in 1587. Francis Rodes, Esq., who was made one of the Justices of the common pleas in 1585, purchased of the family of Selioke, an estate described as the manor of Barlborough ' which had belonged to the Constables. Sir John Rodes, son of the judge, had a chancery suit with Humphrey Pype Esq., son of Sir Richard, who claimed to be sole Lord of the manor of Barlborough, and asserted that the estate purchased of the Seliokes was freehold, but not manerial. It is most probable, that Sir John Rodes, or some of his immediate descendants, afterwards pur chased Pype's moiety. The ancestors of Judge Rodes, had been originally of Lincolnshire, afterwards of Yorkshire; and had been settled at Stavely-Wood thorpe in this county for five generations, in consequence of a marriage with the heiress of Cachehors ; Sir John Rodes, his son, settled at Barlbo- ' Pegge's collection*. \u2022 Rot.

The old mansion, Park-hall, is now a farm-house. A survey of the year 1630', describes three parks in Barlborough, containing altogether about 400 acres of land. There is now no park at Barlborough.

An estate at Barrow, which had been parcel of the manor of Melbourne, was annexed to the see of Carlisle, before the year 1273.* was held on lease under the Bishops of Carlisle by the family of Coke, as parcel of the rectory of Mel bourne. This estate having been enfranchised by virtue of an act of parlia ment passed in 1704, is now the property of the Reverend Henry Des Voeux, whose father-in-law, Daniel Dalrymple, Esq. purchased the fee of Lord Melbourne, about the year 1800.

There is a monument for Robert Beaumont, Esq., who married a daughter of Sir Robert Beaumont of Gracedieu and died in 1726. The church of Barrow in the Deanery of Derby, was formerly appro priated to the prior and convent of St. John of Jerusalem, to whom it was given in the reign of Henry II., by Robert de Bakepuz. The prior and convent had a preceptory here, which, on the authority of the Notitia Monastiea, wTe had erroneously supposed to have been at Barrow, in Cheshire. William Bothe, Esq, in 151 9, died seised of lands at Barrow on Trent, held under the manor of the prior and convent of St. John. This no doubt was their manor of the rectory. William Beaumont, Esq. died seised of the rectory, with a capital messuage, &c. in 1591. This estate is now the property of his descendant, John Beaumont, Esq. who is patron of the vicarage. Mr. Beaumont has lately built a new house on the rectory estate.

It was afterwards in the Blounts ; Sir Henry Blount sold it, in 1640, to Sir John Harpur, ancestor of Sir Henry Crewe, Bart., the present proprietor.

Sinfin-moor, a large common e, on which the Derby races were formerly held, was inclosed by act of parliament, about the year 1804, and allotted amongst the adjoining townships of Sinfin, Barrow, Alvaston, Osmaston, Boulton, Normanton, Chellaston, and Swarkeston. The village of Twyford lies about a mile and three-quarters from Barrow. The manors of Twyford and Stenson (Steintune) were held at the time of the Domesday survey, by Leuric, under Henry de Ferrars. In the reign of Henry VI., they were conveyed by John Curzon of Croxall to John Crewcher and Agnes his wife. Thomas Finderne died in 1558, seised of the manors of Steinson and Twyford ; Jane,' his sister and heiress, brought them in marriage to Richard Harpur, Esq., one of the justices of the Common Pleas. John Harpur, Esq., grandson of Sir Henry Harpur, the first baronet, died seised of this estate, (not then esteemed a manor) in 1 7 1 3, One of his coheiresses brought it to the family of Francis, and by subsequent marriages, it passed successively to Ashby and Bathurst. Since the death of the late General Bathurst of Clarendon-park, Wilts, it has been purchased by Sir Henry Crewe, Bart., who is the present proprietor. In the parochial chapel at Twyford, are some monuments of the Harpur family f; that of Samuel Bristow, Esq., 1767; and some mutilated tombs of ala baster, one of which has the effigy of a man in armour, with the date of 1532. The minister is appointed by the vicar of Barrow. Barton-Blount, in the hundred of Appletree, and in the deanery of Cas tillar, lies about nine miles east of Derby. The manor of Barton (Barctune) was, at the time of the Domesday survey, held by Ralph, under Henry de Ferrars; in the year 1296, under Edward Earl of Lancaster, by John de Bakepuze.6 From this family, it acquired the name of Barton-Bake puze, which, after it had passed into the possession of their successors, the Blounts, was exchanged for that of Barton-Blount.

Not long after this, the manor of Barton came into the family of Merry\", from which it passed by marriage to that of Simpson. In the year 1 75 1, it was purchased of the trustees of Merry Simpson, who is said to have been a mendicant friar in a convent in France, by Sir Nathaniel Curzon ; it is now the property of Francis Bradshaw, Esq. who acquired it by an exchange with the present Lord Scarsdale. The advowson of the rectory has passed with the manor. Barton-Blount-house was garrisoned by Colonel Gell in the month of October 1644, for the purpose of watching the motions of the King's garrison at Tutbury ' ; a skirmish between the two garrisons took place on the 15th of February, 1646. The ancient man sion, which has been modernized, is now the seat of Mr. Bradshaw. Mr. Pole, of Radborne, has a considerable estate in this parish called Barton-fields. Beighton, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, lies about nine miles north from Chesterfield. The parish contains the hamlet or village of Ilackenthorp. The manor of Beighton was given by Wulfric Spott, in the reign of King Ethelred, to Burton Abbey.\" At the time of taking the Domesday survey it appears, that there were two manors in Beighton (Bectune,) one of which was held by Lcwin, under Roger de Busli ; the other, belonged to Roger de Poictou. Sir Gervas de Bernak, Lord of Beighton, is spoken of as one of the benefactors to Beauchief Abbey, before the year 1276, and Walter de Furneaux, as being Lord of the manor in 1279.1 William de Furneaux died seised of it in 1320 ; his sisters and co heiresses married Latimer and Ravensworlh, and, on failure of issue from Latimer, the whole devolved to Henry Fitzhugh, son of Henry de Ravens worth. A co-heiress of Henry, the last Baron Fitzhugh, brought Beighton to Sir John Fiennes, eldest son of Richard, the first Lord Dacre of the south. Gregory Lord Dacre sold this manor in 1570 to Francis Wortley, Esq.

Fenny-Bentley, in the wapentake of Wirksworth, lies nearly nine miles from Wirksworth, and two from Ashborne, which is the post-office town. The manor of Fenny-Bentley belonged to a branch of the Beres fords of Staffordshire, who settled at this place in the reign of Henry VI. The elder branch of the Beresfords of Bentley soon became extinct in the male line ; the heiress married Edmund Beresford, Esq. of Staffordshire, whose heiress married Stanhope; and the heiress of Stanhope, Cotton. The manor passed away from the Beresfords, and having been in various hands is now the property of two unmarried ladies of the name of Irving, who inhe rited from Jackson.

Two years after John's accession, Geoffrey Luttrell was appointed one of the over seers of the expenditure of 30I. for inclosing Bolsover park for the King.* In 1204, the government of this castle was given to William Briwere. Bryan de Lisle was appointed governor in 1207, Nicholas de Chevet in 1208. In the year 12 15, we find Bolsover castle in the possession of the rebellious barons. William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, having raised troops for the King, took it by assault, and in recompence for this service was ap pointed governor. The same year, Bryan de Lisle was reinstated in his go vernment, and in 12 16 received a mandate to fortify the castle against the rebellious barons; or if he found it not tenable, to demolish it. The same year the King appointed Gerard de Furnival to reside in Bolsover castle with his wife and family, for the better preservation of the peace of those parts.

King Henry VIII., in 1514, granted these castles to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk : on the attainder of his son, the second Duke, they reverted to the crown. King Edward VI., in 1552, granted a lease of the manor of Bolsover to Sir John Byron for fifty years, and the next year granted the fee to George Lord Talbot. In 1613, Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury sold the manor of Bolsover to Sir Charles Cavendish. At this time the old castle was in ruins, and it is probable that the remains of it were removed by Sir Charles Cavendish, who, the same year that he purchased the manor, began the foundation of the present castellated mansion. William, elder son of Sir Charles Cavendish, at the age of fifteen was made Knight of the Bath ; in 1620, created Baron Ogle 2 and Viscount Mansfield; in 1628, Baron Cavendish of Bolsover and Earl of Newcastle-upon-Tyne ; in 1644, Baron of Bothal and Hepple, and Marquis of Newcastle ; and in 1665, Earl of Ogle and Duke of New castle. This loyal nobleman entertained King Charles I. with great mag nificence at Bolsover, when he was on his way to Scotland in 1633. The expence of the dinner was 4000I. Lord Clarendon speaks of it as \" such an excess of feasting as had scarce ever been known in England before, and would be still thought very prodigious, if the same noble person had not within a year or two afterwards made the King and Queen a more stupendous entertainment, (which God be thanked) though possibly it might too much whet the appetite of others to excess, no man ever after in those days imitated.\" The Duchess of Newcastle, in her memoirs of her noble husband, expressly says, that this second entertainment was the year after the former, which the King \" liked so well, that a year after his return out of Scot land, he was pleased to send my Lord word, that her Majesty the Queen was resolved to make a progress into the northern parts, desiring him to prepare the like entertainment for her Majesty, as he had formerly done for him, which my Lord did, and endeavoured for it with all possible care and industry, sparing nothing that might add splendour to that feast, which both their Majesties were pleased to honour with their presence.

It cost him in all between fourteen and fifteen thousand pounds.\" a In the early part of the civil war, the Earl of Newcastle, being com mander in chief of the King's forces for the northern and midland counties b, placed a garrison at Bolsover, of which he made Colonel Muschamp governor. The Earl was at Bolsover with his staff in the month of De cember 1643. About the middle of August 1644, Bolsover castle was taken by Major-general Crawford. The parliamentary writers represent it as having been well manned, and fortified with great guns and strong works. It is said to have surrendered on summons, and that 120 muskets were taken in it, with much plunder/ When the Marquis's estates, which had been seized by the parliament, were about to be sold, his friends in England made great efforts to save Bolsover and Welbeck, but in vain. Bolsover was purchased on speculation, with the intention of pulling down the castle, and selling the materials. After part of it had been pulled down, Sir Charles Cavendish repurchased it, at a great disadvantage, for his brother. The family portraits, by Vandyke, were preserved, and Lord Mansfield, after the death of his uncle, had Bolsover castle some time in his possession but was unable to repair it. When the King's affairs had grown desperate, the Marquis of Newcastle retired to the continent, and resided chiefly at Antwerp, till the restoration, after which he returned to England, and in 1665 was created a Duke, as before mentioned. About this period he retired from public life, spending his time chiefly in the country, \" pleasing him self,\" as the Duchess, in the Life of her husband, expresses herself, \" in the management of some few horses, and exercising himself with the use of the sword, which two arts he hath brought, by his studious thoughts, rational experience, and industrious practice, to an absolute perfection.\" The noble Duke had been long celebrated for his eminent skill in the manao-e, in which, at the time that he was governor to Prince Charles (afterwards Charles II.) he had instructed his royal pupil.

After the Duke had a little re covered from the wreck which had been made of his fortune during his banishment, he repaired Bolsover castle, and occasionally resided there during the latter part of his life. Both the Duke and Duchess of New castle found great resources in literary pursuits ; they were both dramatic writers and poets. The Duchess's printed works, which were chiefly philo sophical, fill ten folio volumes, and she left three more in manuscript. Her printed works are become rare, and few of them would afford amusement to readers of the present day, except her Life of the Duke. The Duchess died in 1673, the Duke in 1676 : they were buried in Westminster Abbey, where a magnificent monument was erected to their memory. Henry, the second Duke of Newcastle, who resided often at Bolsover, died there in 1691, and was buried in the parish church : leaving no issue, his estates devolved to his daughter and coheiress Margaret, married to John Holies, Earl of Clare, who, in 1694, was created Duke of Newcastle, Henrietta, their only daughter and heir, married Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford. Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, heiress of the Earl of Oxford, brought the manor, or as it is called in some records, the barony of Bolsover, to William Duke of Portland, grandfather of the present noble owner, William Henry Cavendish Bentinck, Duke of Portland. The barony of Bolsover and Woodthorpe was valued, in 1641, at 846I. 8s. ud. per annum. Bolsover castle, which is situated on the brow of a steep hill, and commands a very extensive prospect, consists of two detached buildings ; one of these, which indeed may properly be called the castle, is a square castellated mansion, with turrets and a tower of larger dimensions at the north-east corner. The foundation of this mansion was laid by Sir Charles Cavendish in the year 161 3. Huntingdon Smithson was the architect. Most of the rooms in this mansion are small. The dining-room, or, as it is called, the pillar-parlour, about 21 feet square, is supported in the centre by a circular pillar, round which is placed the table. Above stairs is a large room called the star-chamber, about 45 feet by 30. This mansion has not for many years been inhabited by its noble owners. It is at present, by the Duke of Portland's permission, in the occupation of the Reverend Mr. Tinsley, vicar of Bolsover. There have been various opinions concerning the date of the magnificent range of buildings, which extends along the grand terrace, now unroofed and in a dilapidated state. Mr. Bray was of opinion, that the apartments in"], [402, "DERBYSHIRE. 54 in these buildings were fitted up for the royal visits before mentioned. Dr. Pegge, on the contrary, supposes this building to have been erected some time after the restoration. Lord Orfbrd, who was of the same opinion with respect to its having been constructed after the Restoration, suggests that it might have been built from designs prepared before the civil war by Smithson, who died in 1648. The date of Diepenbeck's view of Bolsover (1652) decides the point, that the building in question was erected before the Restoration ; it is equally certain that it must have been erected before the civil wars, indeed before the royal visit before-mentioned ; it being im practicable, that the King and Queen, with their court, and \" all the gentry of the country,\" could have been entertained in the mansion already described : indeed, from the slight manner in which the Duchess, in the Life of her husband, speaks of the additions made by him to Bolsover castle, we think it a more probable conjecture, that the great range of building, now in ruins, was built, as well as the mansion which is now habitable, by his father. The Duke's additions probably consisted of the spacious riding house, for the practice of his favourite amusement ; the smithy, &c. &c. Dr. Pegge supposes that the great range of buildings was never completed. There can be little doubt but that it was completed and occupied long before the time of the civil war. During the sequestration of the estates of its noble owner Bolsover castle suffered much, both as to its buildings and furniture ; but these damages were repaired by the Duke after the Restoration. It is certain that the state apartments were not dismantled till after the year 1 7 1 o, at which time, Bassano d speaks of them as furnished, and describes the pictures then in the several rooms, which are said to have been removed to Welbeck. The portraits of the Duke of Newcastle on horseback, described by Bassano, are not now to be found there, probably they were in a state of decay. In the saloon at Welbeck is a very fine whole length por trait of the Duke, by Vandyke ; but it is uncertain whether it was one of those described by Bassano. Those which can be ascertained to have been included in his catalogue are of little value, and are placed in stair-cases, &c. There is a whole length of the Duchess of Newcastle in one of the passages at Welbeck, in a fancy dress, by Diepenbeck. The gallery at Bolsover was about 200 feet in length, by 22 in width ; the dining-room, 78 feet by 32 ; the two drawing-rooms, one 39 feet, the other 36 feet, by 33.

The interest of this money, which has been laid out in bank annuities, is now appropriated under the direction of the Court of Chancery, according to the discretion of the minister, churchwardens, and four trustees : it has hitherto been given (in sums not exceeding three guineas annually,) to per sons upwards of 55 years of age, not possessed of any property, and never having received parochial relief. The manor of Glapwell was held with Bolsover at the time of the Domesday Survey. During the whole, or the greater part, of the thirteenth century, it was in the family of De Glapwell. It is probable that the heiress brought it to the Woolhouses. William Woolhouse, Esq. died seised of it in 141 1. The heiress of Woolhouse, about the middle of the seven teenth century, married the ancestor of Thomas Hallowes, Esq. the present proprietor, who resides at Glapwell-hall. There was formerly a chapel at Glapwell. In the register of Darley Abbey ' is an agreement, about the year 1260, between the abbot and his parishioners of the vill of Glapwell, about roofing the chapel. They agreed to give five acres of land for the purpose of repairing, or, if necessary, of rebuilding the chapel. There was many years a Presbyterian congregation at Glapwell.

These manors became united, and continued annexed to the Earldom and Duchy of Lancaster till the year 1630, when King Charles granted the manor of Bonsall to Charles Harbord, Esq. and others, who in 1632 sold it to Henry Earl of Dover. It was purchased of the latter the following year by the copyholders, for whom it has ever since been held on trust. The present trustees are Bache Thornhill, Esq., of Stanton ; Samuel Frith, Esq., of'Bankhall; and Philip Gell, Esq., of Wirksworth. The family of Hopkin- son had a considerable freehold and copyhold estate in this parish, as early as the reign of Henry V. They became extinct the latter end of the seventeenth century. About that time, Henry Feme, Esq. of Snitterton, Receiver-general of the Customs, became possessed of considerable property in this parish, and by far the largest share of the manor, which is now the inheritance of Alexander Dury, Esq., of Hadley, in the county of Mid- dlesex, son and heir of Major-General Alexander Dury (killed at the siege of St. Cas in 1758,) and Isabel his wife, daughter of Edmund Tumor, Esq., of Stoke-Rochford in the county of Lincoln, by Elizabeth his wife, one of the daughters and coheirs of Henry Feme above-mentioned ; for whom there is a memorial in the parish church, put up by Diana, relict of B. Langton, Esq., his grand daughter, and the Executrix of Mrs. Tumor, who died in 1763. Mr. Feme died in 1723. There is a memorial also in the parish church, for Henry Hopkinson of Lincoln's-Inn, 1634. The Dean of Lincoln is patron of the rectory. The earliest benefaction to the charity-school at Bonsall, was that of William Cragge and his wife Elizabeth, who, in 1704, gave a house and some land at Bonsall, now let at 7I. 13s. 6d. per annum, for the purpose of educating poor children. Mr. Robert Feme, of Bonsall, who died in 17 18, built the school-house, with a dwelling-house for the master.

Boylstone, in the hundred of Appletree aud Deanery of Castillar, lies about 1 3 miles from Derby, which is the post-office town, about seven fro^n Ashborne, and seven from Uttoxeter. The village of Harehill is in this parish. The manor of Boylstone (Boilestune) is described in the Domesday Survey as one of the manors of Henry de Ferrars ; it had belonged in the reign of Edward the Confessor, to Godric and Levenot. The coheiresses of Reginald, who possessed this manor soon after the Conquest, (and held probably under Ferrars,) married Ridware and Grendon : their posterity held the manor in moieties, which afterwards became separate manors. The manor of Boylstone, or as it was called at a later period, Cottons, was conveyed by Ridware to John de Bassinges, whose heiress married Waldeshef: one of the coheiresses of the latter brought it again to the Ridwares, ana the heiress of Ridware to the Cottons. The last-mentioned family possessed this manor for several generations. The coheiresses, in the reign of Henry VII., mar- ried Fitzherbert, Venables, and Grosvenor. Sir Humphrey Ferrers died seised of this manor in 1609 : the Chaloners purchased of Ferrers in 1664. The Reverend Thomas Gilbert, who married the heiress of Chaloner, sold this manor to John Gilbert Cooper, Esq. in 1743; Mr. Gilbert repurchased in 1746, and in 1751 sold to Henry Tatam ; the latter devised it to the Reverend Thomas Manlove, whose widow, Mrs. Susanna Manlove, is the present proprietor. The other manor continued for a considerable time in the Grendon family. Roger de Saperton inherited it on the death of Margaret Seuche in 1362/ In the early part of Queen Elizabeth's reign it was in the Agards, who, in the reign of Charles II., sold it to Mr. John Gisborne. It was afterwards in the Bates, and is now the property of Charles Broadhurst, Esq., whose father purchased it of the late Brownlow Bate, Esq. in the year 1 784.

Bradbourn"], [407, "DERBYSHIRE. 59 Bradbourn or Bradborne, in the wapentake of Wirksworth and deanerv of Ashborne, lies about five miles north from Ashborne. The parish com prises the hamlets of Aldwark, Nether-Bradborne, and Lea-hall ; and the parochial chapelries of Atlow, Balidon, Brassington, and Tissington. Atlow is in the hundred of Appletree. The manor of Bradborne was one of those belonging to Henry de Ferrars at the time of the Domesday Survey. It was held under the Ferrars family, at an early period, by that of Cawz, or de Cauceis. In the reign of King John, Sir Geoffrey de Cauceis conveyed it to Godard de Bradborne. Henry de Bradborne, eldest son of Sir Roger, was executed at Pomfret in 1322, for his adherence to Thomas Earl of Lancaster/ The manor of Bradborne continued in the posterity of his younger brother, John, till the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, when it was sold to Sir Humphrey Ferrers. The late George Marquis Townshend, who inherited- from the Ferrers family, sold this manor, in 1809, to Philip Gell, Esq. M.P., of Hopton-hall, who is the present proprietor. In the parish church are memorials of the family of Buckston or Buxton, (1643\u20141793.) The church of Bradborne was given by Sir Geoffrey de Cauceis, in 1205, to the priory of Dunstaple; which gift was confirmed by William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, as chief lord of the fee. It was appropriated to the priory in 1278, and a vicarage was endowed in 1330/ The rectory of Bradborne was granted, in 1608, to Rogers and Fetherston, of whom most of the tithes were purchased by the several land owners. The rectory-house and glebe lands were purchased, in 1609, of Wright and Stapleton by Mr. George Buxton, ancestor and name-sake of the present proprietor and vicar of Bradborne, whose father first wrote the family name Buckston. The Rectory-house is in the occupation of John Goodwin Johnson, Esq. The Duke of Devonshire is patron of the vicarage. k See Holinshed, where he is erroneously called a Baron. 1 When the church was given to the priory, it had a rector and two vicars. In 12 14, the prior had a suit in the court at Rome with the rectors and vicars, with a view, as it is supposed, of displacing them. It was alleged, that Robert, the rector, was son of Godfrey, a former rector ; that Henry, one of the vicars, was son of John, his predecessor, in one mediety of the vicarage ; and that William, the other vicar, kept a concubine publicly, and went a hunting, forsaking his tonsure and clerical duties. (Chron. sive Annal Dunst.) When the church became vacant, the convent sent one of their canons, who resided at Bradborne, under the name of a custos or warden, accounted with the priory for the profits, and provided for the cure of the church and its chapels ; many years before the rectory was actually appropriated to the priory. The prior kept a great flock of sheep in this pan'sh : it is stated in the Annals of Dunstaple, that 800 died in the year 1243. 1 2 Among"], [408, "DERBYSHIRE. 60 Among the ancient fees due to the vicar, as specified in one of the parish-registers, is the following, \" For a christening, either the chrisom, or 5d.\" The manor of Aldwark was given to the monks of Darley by Sewall, son of Fulcher, ancestor of the Shirley family. Queen Elizabeth granted it to James Hardwick, Esq., and his heiress brought it to Sir William Cavendish, ancestor of the Duke of Devonshire, who is the present proprietor. Aldwark-grange, which had belonged also to the monks of Darley, was granted by King Edward VI., in 1548, to Sir Thomas Heneage and Lord Willoughby, who spld it the next year to Robert Goz or Goch : by succes sive conveyances it passed to the families of Curzon and Manners. John Manners, Esq., procured a fresh grant of it in 1603 ; and it is now the pro perty of his descendant, the Duke of Rutland. Robert, Earl Ferrars, founded an oratory at Aldwark, with a cemetery m, of which there are scarcely any traces. The great tithes of Aldwark belong to the Duke of Devonshire. Bret-Griffe otherwise Griffe-Grange, lies principally in this parish : having belonged to the abbot and convent of Dale, it was granted, in 1 546, to Ralph Gell, Esq., ancestor of Philip Gell, Esq. M. P., of Hopton hall, the present proprietor. Hough or How-grange, in this parish, is the property of Robert Dale, Esq., of Ashborne, whose great-grandfather, Mr. Thurston Dale, purchased it of the Eyres of Hassop in 1 70 1 . Lea-hall was the property and seat of the Bradbornes. William Bradborne sold it with his other estates to Sir Humphrey Ferrers. In or before 1679, Mr. Samuel Swann of Hurdlow purchased it of John Ferrers, Esq. It is now the property of John Sanders, Esq. of Basford in Nottinghamshire, in right of his wife, sister and heiress of the late Mr. Samuel Swann, of that place. Moldridge or Moldrich-grange, in this parish, is supposed to have been given by the Herthills to the abbey of Gerendon in Leicestershire, between which monastery and the priory of Dunstaple, there was a law-suit concerning this estate, The monks at Dunstaple at length purchased it of the abbot and convent of Gerendon, about the year 1 250. This estate was granted by King Henry VIII., in 1544, to Rowland Babington, Esq. It passed by sale, in 1557, to Henry Sacheverell. In 1582, Jane Sacheverell, widow, left it to William Ireton, Esq., son of her first husband German Ireton, Esq.: in 1577, it was conveyed by William Ireton to Sir Humphrey Bradborne.

Revestanes or Riston-grange, in this parish, called in some records, Ravendon-grange, was given to the abbey of Gerendon by Adam de Hert hill, in the year 1219. King Henry VIII. granted it with Moldridge to Rowland Babington, it afterwards belonged to the Cokaines \u00b0, and is now the property of William Webster, Esq., of Ashborne. This gentleman took the name of Webster, pursuant to the will of the late owner, John Taylor, of Ashborne, L.L.D., (the friend of Dr. Johnson,) who had inherited it from the family of Webster. The parochial chapel of Atlow lies about three miles east from Ashborne. The manor of Atlow, the Etelawe of Domesday, was one of the numerous manors belonging to Henry de Ferrars. It was held under him or his im mediate heirs by the ancestor of the ancient family of Okeover, of'Oke over, in Staffordshire ; and is now the property of Rowland Farmer Okeover, Esq. The chapel was augmented, in 1716, by Richard Okeover, Esq., with the tithes of hay and corn ; and it was the first benefice in Derbyshire that was augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. Mr. Okeover presents the minister. Ballidon, a parochial chapelry, lies about six miles from Ashborne, and five from Wirksworth. The manor of Ballidon (Belidene), was at the time of taking the Domes day survey, the property of Ralph Fitzhubert. At a later period, it was for some generations in the family of Herthill, or Harthill, whose heiress brought it to the Cokaines about the beginning of the fifteenth century. A younger branch of the last-mentioned family was for some time settled at Ballidon. Sir Edward Cokaine, about the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, sold this manor to Sir Anthony Ashley, who soon afterwards con veyed it to Baptist Trott and John Milward. Trott's moiety was sold, in 1610, to Nicholas Hurt, and was, eventually, divided into severalties. Milward's moiety was subdivided also amongst the coheiresses of his son. A part of it came to the Boothby family, and having passed by marriage and gift to Matthew Vernon, of London, silk-mercer, was by him bequeathed, from motives of political attachment, to William Murray, Earl of Mansfield. n Together with Candlehay-grange, in this neighbourhood. 0 Thomas Cokaine, 30 Eliz. left it to his daughters Elizabeth and Frances.

On the death of Gilbert Earl of Shrews bury, in 1628, it passed to his daughters and coheiresses, married to William Earl of Pembroke, Henry Earl of Kent, and Thomas Earl of Arundel, The Earl and Countess of Kent, in 1639, conveyed one-third of this manor; and in 1640, Philip Earl of Pembroke, being possessed of his mother's and the Earl of Arundel's share, conveyed the remaining two-thirds to Mr. Wil liam Savile, whose grandson, John Gilbert Cooper, Esq. sold it, in 1749, to Henry Coape, Esq., of Duffield : on the death of Mr. Coape's grandson, it devolved to his cousin Henry Sherbrooke, Esq., of Oxton in Nottingham shire : William Sherbrooke, Esq., now of Oxton, being possessed of this estate by the bequest of his aunt, the late Mrs. Sherbrooke, sold it, in 1804, to Robert Lowe, Esq., who is the present lord of this manor, but has sold the landed property in parcels. The other manor, called the King's or the Duchy manor, having been parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, was granted by King Charles I., in 1630, to Charles Harbord, Esq., and others, who, in 1632, conveyed it to Edward and George Pegge and George Lees. A moiety of this manor having been purchased partly, in 1649, of Henry Buxton, and partly, in 1652, of Edward Pegge and others, passed with Furnival's manor to Mr. Lowe, and has been since sold to Thomas Hayne, Esq., who is the present proprietor. The other moiety belonged sometime to the Newtons of Ashborne-green : it is now the joint property of the infant daughter of the late John Hayne, Esq., whose mother was one of the coheiresses of Newton, and William Locker, Esq., who married the other coheiress.

Mr. Gale's immediate heir, on whose estate the payments were originally charged, was George Lacock/ An act for inclosing lands in this chapelry passed in the year 1803, when an allotment was made in lieu of tithes to Mr. Story, the impropriator, who is also patron of the chapel. Brassington chapel was augmented, in 1812, by Queen Anne's Bounty, and in 18 14, had a parliamentary grant of 1200I. Mr. Thurston Dale, in 1742, gave the long close, now let for about 81. per annum, to a school-master, for instructing twelve poor children of this chapelry. The children are nominated by the heirs of the founders, who appoint a master or mistress. The parochial chapel of Tissington lies about three miles and a half from Ashborne. The manor of Tissington (Tizinctun) belonged, when the survey of Domesday was taken, to Henry de Ferrars. In the reign of Henry I. it was given by one of the Ferrars family to the Savages. The co-heiresses of Savage married Meynell and Edensor\\ whose heiress seems to. have married Audley. The manor was in moieties between Meynell and Audley, from 1275 till 1330', if not longer. Meynell's moiety passed, by marriage, to Francis, whose heiress brought it to Nicholas, a younger son of John Fitzherbert, Esq., of Somersall. The other moiety came to the Herthulls, and passed by marriage to the Cokaines ; it was sold by the latter to Francis Fitzherbert, Esq. about the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign. Wm.

Bradley, in the hundred of Appleby, and deanery of Ashborne, lies about three miles east of Ashborne. At the time of the Domesday Survey, the manor of Bradley belonged to Henry de Ferrars : at a very early period it became the property and seat of the ancient family of Kniveton. \u2014 Upon the extinction of the elder branch, Bradley passed to Sir Gilbert Kniveton, Bart, of Mercaston, whose father had been created a baronet in 161 1, and whose ancestors had been settled at Mercaston for several gene rations.

Brailsford, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Castillar, lies about six miles north-east from Ashborne, and seven from Derby. The parish contains the hamlets of Over-Burrows or Burroughs, Culland, and Ednaston, and the parochial chapelry of Osmaston. The manor of Brailsford, which, in the reign of the Confessor had belonged to Earl Wallef, was one of those givea by William the Conqueror to Henry de Ferrars, under whom it was held by Elsin, or Alsin, ancestor of the ancient family of Brailsford. Henry de Brailsford was fined in the reign of Edward I. for refusing to be made a knight. The heiress of Sir Henry de Brailsford, who was living in 1380, brought this estate to Sir John Bassett, of Cheadle, in Staffordshire. Sir Ralph Shirley, who died about the year 1443, married the heiress of Bassett, of Cheadle and Brailsford ; Sir Ralph Shirley his son, who died in 1466, was buried at Brailsford, where the remains of his monument with a mu tilated inscription are still to be seen. The late Earl Ferrers sold the manor of Brailsford, with several farms, to Mr. John Webster, a banker in Derby : on his becoming a bankrupt, this estate was sold to W. Drury Lowe, Esq. of Locko, of whom it was purchased by the late Charles Upton, Esq. of Derby; the widow of the latter is the present owner. The manor of Over-Burrows with, the adjoining hamlet of Nether-Bur rows, in Langley, belonged from an early period to the Bradbornes, by whom they were sold to the Ferrers family, about the year 1600. Over-Bur rows-hall and estate is the property and residence of Mr. William Osborne, in whose family it has been for nearly two centuries. The manor continued in the Ferrers family till sold by the late Earl Ferrers to Mr. Cox, of Culland. Culland belonged, in the reign of Henry VII., to the family of Shaw ; Thomas Shaw died seised of it in 1498. Immediately after this, it appears to have passed to the Drapers ; the last of whom, Richard Draper, Esq., died in the year 1683, leaving three daughters.

The manor of Ednaston, which had been given to the priory of Tutbury by Robert Earl Ferrars the elder1, was granted by Henry VIII., in 1540, to Sir John Giffard. In 1542, it was conveyed to Francis Shirley, Esq., ancestor of the Honourable Washington Shirley, the present proprietor, whose son resides at Ednaston-hall. In the parish church is the monument of William Leaper Smith, Esq., 1803. Earl Ferrers is patron of the Rectory. The parochial chapel of Osmaston lies about four miles from Brailsford. The manor of Osmaston (Osmundestune) was held with Brailsford under Henry de Ferrars, at the time of the Domesday survey. Alsin de Brails ford gave it to the priory of Tutbury, and it was confirmed by Robert Earl Ferrars, the younger. After this Odinel de Ford, as appears by a deed in the register of Tutbury prior0, had a dispute with the prior and convent concerning this manor, and in the event, it was agreed, that the right should be in the prior and convent, and that Odinel and his heirs should hold it of them, paying an annual rent of 30s. By another deed, which, as well as the former, is without date, Robert de Ruhull gave them the manor (terrarn) of Osmaston, which came to him by his wife Emona, sister of Henry de Ruhull, which Henry is mentioned in the first-mentioned deed. Matthew Kniveton died seised of the manor of Osmaston in 1562. It appears to have since passed with the Bradley estate, and is now the property of Godfrey Meynell, Esq. The chapel, at which the rites of baptism and burial are performed is served by the curate of Brailsford as a chapel of ease. It was determined, in the year 1406, that the rector of Brailsford was bound to provide a minister for this chapel. Breadsall, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Derby, lies about three miles north-east from Derby.

Sir John Bentley died seised of Breadsall priory in 1622; his daughter, and eventually sole heiress, Elizabeth, married Sir Gervase Cutler; Mary, daughter of the latter, brought Breadsall to Sir Edward Mosely, Bart. ; after the death of Sir Edward Mosely, the son, it passed to Sir Edward Mosely, of Hulme, Knight. The daughter of the last-mentioned Sir Edward, brought it to Sir John Bland, Bart., of Kippax-park, whose son, Sir John, sold it, in 1 702, to Thomas Leacroft, Esq.; Mr. Leacroft sold it, in 1703, to Mr. Andrew Greensmith. In the year 1799 the late Erasmus Darwin, Esq, of Derby, purchased it of Mr. Herbert Greensmith Beard and his brothers, to whom it had been conveyed by the devisees in trust of Herbert Greensmith, Esq., who died in 1788. Mr. Darwin died soon after his purchase, having be queathed the priory to his father, the well known physician and poet, who, after his son's death, removed to Breadsall, where he spent the last years of his life and died April 18, 1802. Breadsall Priory is now the property and residence of his widow. The manor of Breadsall, (Braideshale) was given by Wulfric Spott to Burton abbey, in the reign of King Ethelred/ It appears to have reverted to lay hands, and to have been possessed in the Confessor's reign, by Siward. At the time of the Domesday Survey, it was held under Henry de Ferrars by Robert. This Robert, Mr. Blore supposes to have been ancestor of Robert de Dunne, who possessed the manor of Breadsall about the reign of King John/ The grand-daughter of this Robert brought a moiety of the manor to Henry de Curzon ; the heiress of Thomas de Curzon, about the latter end of the fourteenth century, married William Dethick. About the year 1600, the heiress of Dethick brought this estate, called the manor of Breadsall-Overhall, to John Harpur, Esq., (a younger son of Harpur of Swarkston, who died in 1622): having passed to the elder branch of that family, it is now the property of Sir Henry Crewe, Bart.

In the year 1464, it was conveyed by Humphrey Bour chier, Lord Cromwell to Richard Illingworth, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, whose grandson left four daughters, coheiresses ; one of these having married John Dethick, Esq., of Breadsall, brought this manor to her husband ; since which time, the manors of Breadsall-Overhall and Breadsall- Netherhall have been united. In the parish church are monuments of Erasmus Darwin, M. B., and of his son, Erasmus Darwin, Esq., who died in 1799. On the former is the following inscription, \" Erasmus Darwin, M.B., F.

Of the rare union of talents which so eminently distinguished him as a Physician, a Poet, and a Philosopher, his writings remain a public and unfading testimony. His widow has erected this monument, in memory of the zealous benevolence of his disposition, the active humanity of his conduct, and the many private virtues which adorned his character.\" The rectory of Breadsall is in the patronage of Sir Henry Crewe, Bart. An act of parliament for inclosing lands in this parish passed in 18 15, when allotments were given in lieu of tithes. John Hieron, a puritan divine of some note, born at Stapenhill, where his father was vicar, was presented to this rectory by Sir John Gell, in 1644, and continued to possess it till he was ejected for nonconformity in 1662. After a short residence in some other places, he removed, in 1 668, to Loscoe, where he died in 1682, and was buried at Heanor. Mr. Hieron was esteemed an able biblical critic, and abridged Pole's Synopsis, but published only a volume of sermons and a theological work, the title of which is not men tioned in his life. He appears to have meditated a Parochial History of Derbyshire, for which he made considerable collections from records, now in the possession of Godfrey Meynell, Esq. of Langley-park. There is a charity school at Breadsall for 16 children, endowed by the Reverend John Clayton, sometime rector, with the interest of 200I. The school-house was built by Sir Henry Harpur, Bart., in 1788. Church-Broughton, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Castillar, lies about ten miles west from Derby.

The manor of Sapperton (Sapertune) was held by Roger, under Henry de Ferrars, at the time of the Domesday Survey. In the reign of Edward III. it appears to have been in the family of Makeley ; afterwards successively in the Blounts\", (Lords Mountjoy,) and the Agards. In the year 1675, John Agard, Esq. sold this manor to Richard Bate, Esq., of whose descendant, Brownlow Bate, Esq., it was purchased, in 1784, by John Broadhurst, Esq. father of Charles Broadhurst, Esq., the present proprietor. The demesnes of the manor of Sapperton with the ancient hall were sold by the Agards to the family of Wolley. About the year 1670, the daughter of Adam Wolley brought it to Thomas Yates, Esq. ancestor of Henry Yates, Esq., who now resides at the hall ; but the estate was sold some years ago, and is now, by a recent purchase, the property of Edmund Evans, Esq., of Derby. The rectory of Church-Broughton was formerly appropriated to the priory of Tutbury. The benefice is now a vicarage, endowed with the great tithes. The patronage is claimed by Charles Broadhurst, Esq. A charity school at this place was founded, about the year 1745, by a subscription of the freeholders, with which lands were purchased, now let for about 30I. per annum.

The township and manor of Winshull or Winshill, in this part of the parish, belonged to the monastery of Burton, and having been granted, after the dissolution, to the first Lord Paget, is now the property of his descendant, the Marquis of Anglesea. In this parish also, on the Derbyshire side of the Trent, is the manor or farm of Brislingcote or Brisingcote, which belonged to the Hortons in the reign of Henry VI. At this place, now the property of the Earl of Chester field, is a house of singular construction, built about the year 1700, by the then Earl, and sometime inhabited by his son, Lord Stanhope.

The monks of Calke removed first to Depedale, (the site of Dale abbey,) and afterwards to Repton. The site of the priory, at Calke, was granted by King Ed ward VI., in 1547, to John Earl of Warwick. In 1577, Calke priory was the property and seat of Roger Wendesley, (or Wensley,) Esq. In 1582, the Calke estate was sold by Richard Wensley Esq. to Robert Bainbrigge, Esq. In 1 62 1, Mr. Bainbrigge conveyed it to Henry Harpur, Esq., of Normanton, who, in 1626, being then described of Calke, was created a baronet. His son, the second baronet, inherited the estates of the elder branch, which became extinct in 1677. Sir Henry, the seventh and present baronet, in the year 1808, took the name of Crewe, it being that of his great-grandmother, one of th daughters and coheiresses of Thomas Lord Crewe, of Stene. In the parish church is a handsome marble monument, in memory of Sir John Harpur, Bart., who died in 1741, he married Catherine, youngest daughter of Lord Crewe above-mentioned. In the chancel is the portrait of Sir John Harpur, the second baronet, who died in 1669, aged 53. The church of Calke was given to the canons of that house by Harold de Leke before their removal ; it was confirmed to the canons of Repton, in 1324. Sir Henry Crewe is impropriator of the tithes, and patron of the perpetual curacy. Carsington, in the wapentake of Wirksworth and in the deanery of Ashborne, lies about three miles from Wirksworth and seven north-east from Ashborne. Carsington (Ghersintune) is described in the Domesday Survey, as a hamlet of Wirksworth.

Mrs. Temperance Gell, in 1726, founded a school at Carsington for 20 children of that parish, and the adjoining township or hamlet of Hopton. Samuel Bendall, cook at Hopton, gave in the year 1727, the sum of 50I. for clothing the children. This sum having been added to Mrs. Gell's bene faction, was laid out in the purchase of lands at Ockbrook, now producing a rent of 60I. per annum, which suffices for the clothing and educating of the number of children fixed on by the foundress.

There was anciently a market at this place, held on Wednesdays, which existed before the year 1222/ There is now neither market nor fair. The manor of Castleton is described, in the Domesday Survey, as \" Terra Castelli W. Peverel, in Peche fers.\" This estate belonged, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, to Gundeberne and Hundine.

Thecastle afterwards acquired the name of the Castle of Pec, or Peke, or Peak Castle. It was forfeited, with the manor, by William Peverel, the younger.

Soon after the compilation of that Survey, the manor of Chesterfield was given to William Peverell. King Henry II. seized this, and other estates of William Peverell, the younger, after he had fled the kingdom, on account of the murder of the Earl of Chester. King John, in 1204, granted the manor of Chesterfield, with Brimington and Whittington, and the whole wapentake of Scarsdale, to William Briwere.

In the year 1442, Richard Ne vill, Earl of Salisbury, became possessed of the manor of Chesterfield, in right of Alice his wife, one of the co-heiresses of Earl Edmund/ In the year 1472, an act of parliament passed, by which the castle of Scarborough, with lands in Yorkshire, were given to Anne, Duchess of Gloucester, one of the coheiresses of Richard, the succeeding Earl of Salisbury, in exchange for the manor of Chesterfield/ It appears, nevertheless, that it was after wards possessed by Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, daughter and heiress of Isabel, Duchess of Clarence, the Duchess of Gloucester's sister ; and that she gave it to George, Earl of Shrewsbury, in exchange for other estates/ William, Earl of Newcastle, purchased this manor of the Shrews bury family. Having descended, in the same manner as Bolsover, to the late Duke of Portland, the manor of Chesterfield and the hundred of Scars dale, were exchanged by him, in 1792, with the late Duke of Devonshire, for some estates in Nottinghamshire ; and they are now vested in the pre sent Duke. King John, by his charter of 12041, granted a weekly market at Chester field, on Saturday, and a fair for eight days, at the festival of the Holy- Rood.

King John's charter, already mentioned, made Chesterfield a free bo rough, and granted to the burgesses the same privileges which were enjoyed by those of Nottingham. Queen Elizabeth, in 1594, granted them a new charter of incorporation ; under which the corporate body consists of a mayor, six aldermen, six brethren, and twelve common-council, or capital burgesses, with a town-clerk, and other officers.

The Michaelmas sessions were held at Chesterfield, from the year 1618 to the year 1797: since that time, the Midsummer sessions have been held at Chesterfield, and the Michaelmas sessions at Derby. The present town-hall was erected about the year 1790, from the designs of Mr. Carr, of York. It appears, by the Chantry Roll, that there were, in the parish of Ches terfield, in 1547, about 2000 persons of 16 years of age/ In the month of December, 1788, the town of Chesterfield was found, by an actual enu meration, to contain 801 houses, and 3626 inhabitants.

The principal manufactures of the town are, cotton hose, woollen gloves, hats, and brown earthenware. There is a large iron-foundry, adjoining the town, whence cast iron is sent to every part of the kingdom. During the war, the proprietors had extensive contracts with government for cannon-balls, shells, &c.

John Billingsley, who wrote against the Quakers, was ejected from this vicarage in 1662. Godfrey Foljambe, of Walton, who died in 1595, bequeathed a rent-charge of 40I. per annum, as the endowment of a lectureship, at Chesterfield, the patron age of which he vested in the Archbishop of York.

King Henry VII. granted it for life to John Blythe in 1507 ; but Mar garet Countess of Salisbury seized it as an appendage of the manor : Fran cis Earl of Shrewsbury claimed it on the same grounds in 1547/ We suppose the site of this hospital to have been at a place called Spital, near the Rother, about half a mile south-east of the town, which belonged for merly to the Jenkinsons, and was sold by the coheiresses of Woodyear to the late Sir Thomas Windsor Hunloke, Bart.

At the time of the dissolution of monasteries, it was parcel of the possessions of Beauchief-abbey, and appears to have been granted to Sir William West, whose son, Edmund West, Esq., sold it in the year 1570 to Anthony and Gervase Eyre. Thomas Eyre, of Newbold, a zealous royalist, was governor of Welbeck, under the Earl of Newcastle. It is said, that being captain of a troop, he was three times in one action personally engaged with Cromwell and obliged him to retreat/ The manor of Newbold is now the property of the Duke of Devonshire, having been included in the before-mentioned exchange. Highfield, in Newbold, came into the family of Eyre by marriage with the heiress of Milnes of that place. It is now the property and residence of Vincent Henry Eyre, Esq.

The manor of Walton was the property, and Walton-hall for some generations the seat, of the ancient family of Breton, whose heiress brought it to Sir John Loud ham. Sir John Loudham, the younger, having died without issue, in or about the year 1392, his sisters and coheirs brought this estate, in moieties, to Thomas Foljambe, Esq., and Sir John Beckering. The Foljambes eventually became possessed of the whole, and Walton-hall was their chief seat, till Sir Francis Foljambe, who had been created a Baronet in 1622, sold it, in 1633, to Sir Arthur Ingram the elder, and Sir Arthur Ingram the younger. The Ingrams, in or about the year 1636, sold Walton to Mr. Paul Fletcher, by whom it was bequeathed to his nephew, Richard Jenkinson. Paul Jenkinson, son of Richard, was created a Baronet in 1685. The title became extinct by the death of Sir Jonathan, the third Baronet, in 1741. Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Paul, the second Baronet, being possessed of this estate, gave it to her mother.

The parochial chapelry of Brampton lies about two miles north-west from Chesterfield. It comprises the hamlets, or villages, of Ashgate, Hallclifti Holy-Moor-side, and Watshelf, or Watchell. The Survey of Domesday describes three manors in Brampton (Bran tune) ; two of which belonged to Ascoit Musard, the third to Walter Dein court. The two former appear to have been united at an early period. This manor of Brampton was given by King Henry II. to Peter de Bramp ton, whom we suppose to have been the second son of Matilda de Cauz, or Caus, heiress of the barony of Caus, by her second husband, Adam de Birkin. The grandson of this Peter assumed the name of De Caus. This family became extinct, in the male line, about the year 1460: two of the coheiresses married Ash and Baguley, or Balguy. The whole of the manor of Brampton, otherwise Caus-hall, became eventually, by purchase, the pro perty of the Earls of Shrewsbury e : it was purchased of the Shrewsbury family by the Earl of Newcastle; and was, in 1641, valued at 142I. 4s. 8d. per annum.

There was formerly a market at Crich, which, although we have not been able to find any record of its grant, appears to have been of consider able antiquity. It was attempted to be revived about the middle of the last century, at which period it had been long discontinued. In 1810, it was again opened, and continues to be held for corn, provisions, &c. on Thursdays. There are two fairs, April 6, and Oct. 11, for horses, cows, sheep, pigs, woollen clothes, cotton goods, and pedlars' wares. The manor or barony of Crich belonged, when the survey of Domesday was taken, to Ralph Fitz-Hubert. The heiress of his descendant, Hubert Fitz-Ralph, brought it to Anker de Frecheville, whose son Ralph was pos sessed of it in 1 2 18. Roger Belers, who purchased this manor of Ralph de Frecheville (a descendant of the former), died seised of it in 1325. Sir Roger Belers, who died in 1380, left two daughters, who possessed this manor in moieties ; but the whole devolved eventually to the descendants of Sir Robert de Swillington, who married the elder. From the Swillingtons, the manor of Crich passed, by inheritance, to Ralph Lord Cromwell, who in the reign of Henry VI. sold the reversion to John Talbot, the second Earl of Shrewsbury. Upon the death of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1 61 6, it was divided between his daughters and coheiresses, the Countesses of Pembroke, Kent, and Arundel. The Countess of Pembroke's share passed through the Savilles, to an ancestor of the Earl of Thanet, who is the present proprietor. The Countess of Kent conveyed her share to her uncle, Edward Earl of Shrewsbury. The Duke of Shrewsbury, in 17 10, sold the lands, which were soon afterwards divided into parcels ; and in 171 1, conveyed his third of the manor or barony to William Sudbury, and four other persons. The remaining third was sold, in 1660, for 3270I., by the Honourable Henry Howard, to Anthony Bennet and Ralph Smith, by whom it was disposed of in severalties.

There was a chantry in the church of Crich, \" for God's service, and maintaining of poor folk,\" founded in 1350, by Sir William de Wakebridge, in honour of St. Nicholas and St. Catherine ; and another, founded in 1361, by Sir William de Wakebridge, Ric. de Chesterfield, and Ri. de Tissington, in honour of the Virgin Mary. The income of the former was valued, in 1547, at 12I. 4s. 4^d. per annum ; the other at 61. 3s. 4d.s The manor of Tansley, which belonged to the Knights-Templars, and afterwards to the Hospitallers, is supposed to have been granted to George or Francis, Earl of Shrewsbury. William Earl of Pembroke, who married one of the coheiresses of Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury, sold it to William Earl of Newcastle, from whom it has passed, with Bolsover and other estates, to his Grace the Duke of Portland, who is the present proprietor. The manor of Wakebridge belonged, at an early period, to a family whose ancestor took his name from the place. Peter, son of Ralph de Wakebrugge, married a daughter of Hubert Fitz- Ralph, Lord of Crich, in the reign of King John. Sir William de Wakebridge, who distinguished himself in the wars with France, and is spoken of by Wyr ley', as a valiant knight, though he bore colour upon colour in his arms, died without issue, in the reign of Edward III. : his sister brought this estate to the Poles, of Staffordshire, and afterwards of Radborne in this county ; a younger branch of which family became possessed of this manor, and settled at Wakebridge. On the death of John Pole, Esq. of Wake bridge, in 1724, it passed to his great nephew, Garalt Morphy, whose bro ther\u00b0and heir, Edward, sold it, in 1 771, to Peter Nightingale, Esq., of Lea.

It appears to have been given to the monks of Darley, by Ralph Fitz-Odo, and Geffrey de Constantin/ The monks held it under John de Heriz, in the reign of Edward I. King Henry VIII. granted it, in 1544, to Thomas Babington, Esq., whose son, Henry, died seised of it in 1570. Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, was lord of this manor in 161 1. In 1657, it was sold by the Earl of Arundel, grandson of one of his coheiresses, to Ri chard Taylor and William Hill, yeomen, whose grandsons were possessed of it in 1760.

Croxall, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley, and in the deanery of Repington, lies at the southern extremity of the county, about seven miles from Burton on Trent and about the same distance from Tamworth and Lichfield. The last-mentioned is the post-town. The parish contains the townships of Croxall and Catton, and part of Edingale. The manor of Croxall (Crocheshalle) was held under Henry de Ferrars at the time of taking the Domesday Survey, by one Roger, ancestor probably of the Curzons. It was one of the knight's-fees held by Richard de Curcun, in the reign of Henry I. Croxall continued to be the property and seat of this ancient family till the reign of Charles L, when Mary, only daughter and heiress of Sir George Curzon c, brought it to Sir Edward Sackville, K. B., afterwards the fourth Earl of Dorset. This Lady, who had been appointed \"by the King, governess to some of his children, conducted herself in that situation with so much pru dence, notwithstanding the Earl was a zealous royalist, that a public funeral was voted for her by both houses of parliament ; and she was buried with great pomp in Westminster- Abbey, on the 3d of September, 1645/ The Dorset family resided occasionally at Croxall ; and tradition speaks of Dryden's having been a visitor there. The manor was purchased of John Frederick Duke of Dorset, by Thomas Prinsep, Esq. well known as an agri culturalist, particularly for his fine breed of cattle. After the death of his son, the late Thomas Prinsep, Esq., it devolved under his will to his nephew, Dugdale's Monasticon. 1 Sir George Curzon died in 1622, and was buried in St. Bride's church, in London.

A school-house has lately been erected in this parish ; and a school is supported on the Madras system, but it has no endowment. The manor of Catton (Chetun) was held, at the time of taking the Domesday Survey, by Roger, under Henry de Ferrars. The paramount Lordship passed in marriage with Amicia, daughter of Henry de Ferrars, to Nigel de Albini ; and it continued in that family in the reign of Henry III. Aylmer, Baron St. Amand, descended from one of the coheiresses, died seised of it in 1403. We are not certain whether Roger Horton, Esq., Lord of the manor of Catton, who died in 142 1, first settled here in consequence of a purchase from the representatives of Lord St. Amand, or whether his ancestors had previously held the estate under this baronial family, as paramount Lords. Catton is now the property, and the hall the seat, of Eusebius Horton, Esq., lineal descendant of Roger Horton above mentioned. Part of Edingale or Edingliall is in the parish of Croxall, the county of Derby and the hundred of Repton and Gresley.

This place had formerly a market on Mondays, granted, in 125 1, to William Montgomery, together with a fair for three days at the festival of St. Andrew/ The fair is still held, on the 30th of November : it was, some years ago, much noted for the sale of fat hogs ; but is on the decline. The manor of Cubley (Cobelei) was held at the time of taking the Domes day Survey, under Henry de Ferrars, by Ralph, most probably an ancestor of the Montgomery family, who are known to have possessed it as early as the year 1 1 60. John Montgomery, Esq., the last heir male, died in 151 3, leaving three daughters coheirs, one of whom brought Cubley and other estates to Sir Thomas Giffard, with whose heiress they passed to Sir John Port, of Etwall. Sir John had three daughters, coheiresses, the younger of whom brought Cubley to the Stanhopes. The Earl of Chesterfield is Lord of the manor and patron of the rectory. Cubley was the chief seat of the Montgomery family, who had a park there ; and it was for a time one of the seats of the Stanhopes ; but the mansion has long ago been pulled down. On the tower of the parish church are the arms of the Montgomery family and its alliances ; and there are some ancient monuments belonging to them in the church, but the inscriptions have been destroyed. * Mamton-Montgomery, a chapel of ease to Cubley, from which it is about two miles distant, was so called, to distinguish it from Marston-on-Dove. The manor was part of the ancient property, and here was a seat of the Montgomery family : the manor, we are informed, is now vested in the free holders. Parochial rites are performed at this chapel.

At this place was an abbeyof Premonstratension canons. The site of Dale-abbey is said to have been originally occupied by a hermitage, constructed by a baker of Derby, who, according to the legend, had a supernatural call from the Virgin Mary to spend the remainder of his life in solitude and religious exercises at this place, then called Depedale. The history of Dale-abbey relates, that Ralph Fitz-Germund, Lord of Ockbrook, in whose woods this hermitage was built, discovered it accidentally whilst hunting, and being moved with compassion at the hermit's appearance, gave him the site of the hermitage, and the tithe of his mill at Burgh (Burrowash) for his support. Serlo de Grendon, who married Fitz-Germund's daughter, gave Depedale to his godmother : he afterwards, with her consent, invited canons from Calke and gave them Depedale. These canons having been removed for their misconduct, some white canons of the Premonstratension order repaired thither, and to them the park of Stanley was given, when the monastery acquired the name of \" De Parco Stanley,\" by which it was, at that early period, generally known. There is a legend, that the King gave the canons as much land as they could encircle in a day, with a plough drawn by deer, and this story is represented on the windows in Morley church, which are supposed to have been removed from Dale-abbey. These canons, nevertheless, not having sufficient means for their support, returned to Tupholm, whence they came. William de Grendon, Lord of Ockbrook, supplied their place with canons from Welbeck, but they also soon deserted the new monastery for want of sufficient sustenance. Geoffrey de Salicosa Mare, or Saucemere, and his wife Maud, grand-daughter of William de Germund, with the assistance of his nephew, William de Grendon, having procured an establishment of nine canons from Newhouse in Lincoln shire, they were admitted into the Premonstratension order, and settled at the new monastery in Stanley-park, and being more fortunate than their predecessors, met with liberal benefactors, who bestowed on them lands of considerable value, and the advowsons of Heanor, Ilkeston, and Kirk- Hallam. This last foundation of Dale-abbey took place about the year 1204. The abbey was surrendered to the crown in 1539, when their revenues were estimated at 144I. 4s- per annum. Willis says, that it was surrendered by John Staunton, the last abbot, and sixteen monks ; but it appears"], [444, "DERBYSHIRE. 96 appears by the commissioners accounts e of that date, that John Bede, the last abbot, had a pension of 26I. 13s. 4d., and fifteen monks various smaller pensions. Francis Pole, Esq., who then took possession of the site and demesnes, as lessee, probably, under the crown, purchased the altar, crucifix, organ, grave-stones, &c. and all the live and dead stock. In 1544, he had a grant of the abbey estate in fee, and the same year conveyed it to Sir John Port, one of the justices of the King's-Bench. Dorothy, one of his son's coheiresses, brought it to her husband Sir George Hastings. Sir Henry Willoughby, of Risley, purchased this estate early in the seven teenth century, [of the 'representative of Sir George Hastings, who was afterwards Earl of Huntingdon, and died in 1605. Sir Henry Willoughby, having left three daughters coheiresses, one of whom left no issue, the manor of Dale and the abbey demesnes were held in moieties by the noble family of Grey and that of Dewes, into which the other coheiresses mar ried. One moiety of this estate was purchased, in 17 16, by the trustees of Philip, then late Earl of Chesterfield, of Sir Symmonds Dewes, for his son Alexander, father of the first Earl Stanhope. The other moiety was purchased, in 1778, of the Earl of Stamford, and the whole is now the property of the present Earl Stanhope. There are scarcely any remains of the conventual buildings. There is a small chapel here for the use of the district, and what is very remarkable, under the same roof and having a communication with a public house.

The manor of Darley (the Derelei of Domesday) was parcel of the ancient demesne of the crown. In the reign of Edward I., it was in moieties between the families of Kendall and Derby, who held under the crown. William Kendall, who died in 1309, left a daughter and heir married to Laurence Cotterell.5 It is probable that Cotterell died without issue, and that his widow married Herberjour ; for it appears, that in the year 1392, William Roper conveyed to Nicholas Attewelle, Rector of Darley, (probably a trustee) a moiety of the manor of Darley, which had been the inheritance of Margaret his mother, daughter and coheir of Sir William Le Herberjour, of Chaddesden, by Alice, daughter and heir of William Kendall.\" After this, it was in the Foljambes ; Sir Thomas Foljambe, father of Sir Godfrey, who died in 1379, is described in the pedigree of the family, as having been of Darley ; but it is certain that they were not possessed of any interest in the manor at so early a period, nor can we learn how or when they acquired it.' The heiress of another Sir Godfrey Foljambe brought a moiety of the manor of Darley, which moiety was then called the manor of Oldhall, to Sir Robert Plumpton, of Plumpton in Yorkshire. The coheiresses of William Plumpton, his grandson, mar ried Sotehill and Rocliff : Sotehill's moiety of this manor descended to two grand-daughters, married to Sir John Constable and Sir William Drury. It is supposed that the latter purchased Constable's share of this moiety ; in 1547, he sold the whole of the moiety to William Needham, Gent.: it soon afterwards passed by sale to Senior of Bridgetown. This moiety is now vested in the Duke of Rutland\" and Sir Henry Hunloke, a minor. On this moiety of the estate, stood the ancient manor-house of Oldhall, a little to the north of Darley-church, which upon the inclosure of Darley commons, was allotted to the then Duke of Rutland. Some consider able remains of the old mansion were taken down in the year 1771.

In the time of Edward the Confessor, Derby was a royal borough ; the number of its burgesses being then 243, exclu sively, as it appears, of 41 burgesses who occupied lands adjoining to the town. At the time of the Norman survey, the number of burgesses was reduced to 140 ; forty of whom are described as of inferior degree. At this time, there were 103 dwellings waste and empty which had formerly paid taxes. Two parts of all taxes, tolls, and customs, then belonged to the King, and the remaining third part to the Earl. King Henry I., when Duke of Normandy, granted the town of Derby to Ralph, Earl of Chester. The burgesses held the town in fee-farm before the year 1204, when King John granted them the same privileges, which the burgesses of Nottingham enjoyed; and confirmed their mercatorial gild, on condition. of which they were to pay the old rent, together with an increase of iol. per \"annum.

Queen Elizabeth first granted the burgesses the privilege of having two bailiffs. King James I., in 161 1, granted them a charter, by which their corporation was made to consist of two bailiffs and 24 burgesses, with a recorder, cham berlain, and other officers. Among the privileges granted by King James's charter was, that no stranger should carry on trade in the town, except at the markets and fairs. King Charles I., in 1629, granted the burgesses a new charter, under which the body corporate consists of a mayor, nine aldermen,' 14 brethren, and 14 capital burgesses. The chief officers are a high-steward, recorder, and town-clerk. Henry Mellor was appointed the first Mayor. The four senior aldermen are perpetual magis trates ; the Mayor is vested with the same powers during his mayoralty and the year following.

It appears, that in former times, this town was famous for dyeing cloth, and that one of the privileges granted by King John's Charter to the bur gesses, was, that no one should dye cloth within ten leagues of Derby, except at Nottingham. It is said also to have been a great mart for wool.

The chief trade of Derby, about a century ago, consisted in malting and brewing ale, which was in great request, and sent in considerable quantities to London ; in corn dealing also, and baking of bread for the supply of the northern parts of the county.'

There are two public breweries for ale. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, the first silk-mill that had been established in England, was constructed at Derby by Mr. Cotchett : it is spoken of as a singular curiosity in Mr. Wolley's manuscript account of Derbyshire, written in 171 2. The machinery of this mill having been found inadequate to its intended purposes, the projector soon failed, and *.e works were abandoned. A few years afterwards, Mr. John Lombe, an excellent mechanic and designer, went to Italy, and having, by bribery, procured the assistance of two artists from the silk-mills there, made draw ings and models of the machinery, and having with difficulty made his escape, returned to England with the two Italians k, about the year 1717. The next year he procured a patent, but before he could enjoy the fruit of his labours, fell a sacrifice, as was suspected, to the revenge of the Italian manufacturers, and died by poison.1 After the death of a brother, the con cern fell into the hands of his cousin, Sir Thomas Lombe, who died in 1738. These silk-mills, which are still worked, are the property of the corporation, and have long been occupied by Messrs. Swift and Co. k Gartrevalli, one of these Italians, assisted afterwards in setting up the silk-mills in Macclesfield. 1 Hutton's History of Derby, where it is said that his funeral was the most superb ever seen in Derby; the procession extending from his house in Silk-mill-lane to the door of All-Saints' church. (It appears by the parish register, that Mr. Lombe was buried in Nov. 1722.) Mr. Hutton's account of the silk-mill, is one of the most interesting passages in his History. The author, who was born in Derby of poor parents, was apprenticed, in 1730, at a very early age, for seven years, to work in these mills. \" My parents,\" says he, \" through mere necessity put me to labour before nature had made me able. Low as the engines were, I was too short to reach them. To remedy this defect, a pair of high pattens were fabricated and lashed to my feet, which I dragged after me till time lengthened my stature,\" p. 192, 193. Mr. Hutton, speaking of the silk-mill, observes, p. 204., that all \" the describers of this elaborate work, fol- lowing the first author, tell us that it contains 26,000 wheels, 97,000 movements, which work 71,000 yards of silk-thread, while the water-wheel, which is 18 feet high, makes one evolution, and thit three are performed in a minute ; that one fire-engine conveys warmth to every indi- vidual part of the machine,\" &c. Had the author made the number of his wheels 10,000 less, he would have been nearer the mark ; or if he had paid an unremitting attendance for seven years, he might have found their number 13,384. Perhaps his movements, an indeterminate word, will also bear a large discount. What number of yards are wound every circuit of the wheel no man can tell, nor is the number open to calculation. Nor is the superb fire-engine, which blazes in description, any more than a common stove, which warmed one corner of that large building, and left the others to starve ; but the defect is now supplied by fire places.

Strutt have also a silk-mill and a cotton-mill, in which have been introduced several excellent mechanical improvements, for facilitating and expediting the several processes. The manufacture of stockings was introduced into Derby about the same time as the silk-mill. About the year 1756, Messrs. Strutt and Woollatt introduced their ingenious invention of making ribbed stockings, for which they had obtained a patent. Mr. Pilkington supposed, that in 1789, there were about 170 stocking frames in the town, and that the hosiers of Derby employed nearly six times as many in the neighbourhood. The stocking manufacture has been considerably increased since that time. The slitting mills at the Holmes, which prepare iron for various purposes, were erected in the year 1734, and three years afterwards, other works for smelting, rolling, and preparing copper.m The porcelain manufacture was established at Derby, about the year 1750, by Mr. Duesbury. The Derby porcelain has long been held in esteem, and has of late years been much improved in its composition and ornaments. The clay and granite used in this manufacture, are brought from Cornwall. This manufactory now belongs to Mr. Bloore, who lately employed about 200 workmen. Messrs. Brown and Mawe have a large manufactory for making vases and various other ornamental articles of the fluor spar called blue-john. Besides the manufactures already mentioned, there are at Derbv, a bleaching mill on Nun's-green, worked by steam ; a calicoe factory; two worsted mills ; a mill for making tin plates ; a red lead mill ; white lead works ; and a shot-mill, erected in 1809, by Messrs. Cox and Co.\" The principal trade of Derby, at an early period, was that of wool. Camden, writing in the reign of James I., tells us, that the wealth of the town arose then entirely from buying up corn, and retailing it to the people in the uplands, and that almost all the inhabitants were forestalled of that sort. Blome speaks of its trade, in 1673, as being chiefly in barley, which was made into malt, and sold northward ; he observes, that the trade of the town would be much advanced if the river Derwent was made navigable, which might easily be done. This was accomplished in the year 1719.0 After the making of the Derby canal, the act for which passed 33 Geo.

There is a large wharf at Derby, and several of the manu factories already mentioned are on the sides of the canal. The earliest event relating to the town of Derby, recorded in history, is its capture by the Danes about the year 918, and its recapture by Alfred's daughter, Ethelfleda Countess of Mercia, who boldly attacked the castle and took it by storm, after a severe struggle.\" After this it fell again into the hands of the Danes, from whom King Edmund recovered it with four other towns in 942.\" It is probable, that the castle at Derby was suffered to go to ruin after the Norman conquest. Its site is denoted by the names of the Castle hill and the Castle-field in the parish of St. Peter, near the London road. A house was built on or near the site about the year 171 1, by its owner, Mr. John Borrow, which is now the property of his descendant, Thomas Borrow, Esq., and in the occupation of Lady Grey de Ruthin. After the conquest, we find no event of much note relating to this town for several centuries.

She was a builder, a buyer and seller of estates, a money lender, a farmer, and a mer- chant of lead, coals, and timber. When disengaged from these employments, she intrigued alter- nately with Elizabeth and Mary, always to the prejudice and terror of her husband. She lived to a great old age, continually flattered, but seldom deceived, and died immensely rich, and without a friend. The Earl was withdrawn by death from these complicated plagues, on the 18th of November, 1590/' vol. i. Introd. p. xvii. In the disputes between the Countess and her husband, which had proceeded to an open rupture towards the latter part of his life, the Queen took the Lady's part, enjoined the Earl the irksome task of submission, and allowed him a rent of |ool. per annum out of his estate, leaving, as it appears the whole disposal of the remainder in the Countess's hands. In a letter to the Earl of Leicester dated Apr. 30, 1585, he says, \" Sith that her Matie hathe sett dowen this hard sentence agaynst me, to my perpetual infamy and dis- honor, to be ruled and overanne by my wief, so bad and wicked a woman ; yet her Matie shall see that I obey her cornandemente, thoughe no curse or plage in the erthe cold be more grevous to me.

From this time they appear to have lived separate. The Bishop of Lich- field and Coventry (Overton,) in a long letter, in which he labours to bring about a recon ciliation, appears to take the Lady's part, though he admits that she was reported to be a shrew. \" Some will say, (observes the Bishop) in yr L. behalfe tho'the Countcsse is asharpe and bitter shrewe, and therfore lieke enough to shorten yr liefe if shee should kepe yow company : In deede my good Lo.

Darley-hall, a modern mansion, is the residence of Walter Evans, Esq. Little-Chester, supposed to have been a Roman station, lies about half a mile from Derby. The manor is described irt the Survey of Domesday as parcel of the ancient demesne of the crown. In the reign of Edward I. it belonged, as it now does, to the Dean of Lincoln. The family of Degge for some time held a moiety of this manor under the Dean. The present lessee of the manor of Little-Chester, cummembris, is the Duke of Devonshire. Little-Eaton lies about three miles and a half nearly north from Derby : the township is within the, manor of Little-Chester. The chapel was rebuilt about the year 1788 : the minister is appointed by the vicar of St. Alkmund, to whom fees for burials, &c. at the chapel, are payable. Philip de Wilughby inclosed a park at Little-Eaton in the reign of Richard I.' Quarndon, commonly called Quarn, lies about three miles nearly north from Derby. It is one of the members of the manor of Little-Chester. The Mundy family had a seat at Quarndon, which passed, by a female heir, to Musters, of Nottinghamshire. This house and estate now belongs to Lord Scarsdale, who has most of the landed property in the township. The lands in this township have been inclosed by an act of parliament passed in 1808. Near Quarndon is a chalybeate water, which had considerable celebrity more than a century ago ; and is still occasionally resorted to in the summer season. The parish of St. Michael contains nothing remarkable. The church of St. Michael, which had belonged to the Abbey of Derley, was given by Queen Mary to the Bailiff and burgesses, with the church-yard, &c. ; but the vicarage is still in the gift of the crown. The parochial chapel of Alvaston lies about three miles from Derby, on the road to Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

The manor and hall passed by marriage to the Borrows, and was sold in 1812, by John Borrow, Esq., to John Elliot, Esq. The Earl of Harrington purchased the manor of Mr. Elliot ; and Mr. Joseph Wheeldon, the hall and some of the demesne lands. The tithes of Alvaston formerly belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Darley, as parcel of the rectory of St. Michael. In the reign of Henry VII., after a long litigation concerning their respective rights between the Abbot of Darley, the Vicar of St. Michael's, and the inhabitants of Al vaston, it was agreed that the Abbot and Convent should have the tithes of hay and corn ; that the inhabitants should present a chaplain ; that they should pay him 3I. per annum, and that he should have the small tithes and oblations. St. Michael appears to have been then acknowledged as the mother-church, by their having agreed to attend divine service there one Sunday in every year. The impropriation belonged formerly to the cor poration of Derby, under Queen Mary's grant ; but had been alienated to the Alestreys, and passed, with the manor, &c, to the Borrows. An allotment was given, in lieu of tithes, to John Borrow, Esq., at the time of the inclosure in 1802. The inhabitants still nominate the perpetual Curate. The parish of St. Peter is extensive ; comprising a large part of the borough of Derby, the township of Litchurch, and the chapelries of Bol ton, Normanton, and Osmaston.

It is certain that it existed as early as the twelfth century, and it seems to have been founded in the reign of Henry II., soon after the removal of the canons of St. Helen's to Derley. Walter Durdant, Bishop of Lichfield, in his charter, speaks of the school at Derby as the gift of himself and William de Barba Aprilis/ Soon aster this, whilst Richard Peche, who succeeded Walter Durdant in 11 62, was Bishop of Lichfield, Walkelin de Derby and Goda his wife gave the man sion in which they dwelt, and which Walkelin had purchased of William Alsin, to the canons of Derley, on condition that the hall should be for ever used as a school-room, and the chambers for the dwelling of the master and clerks.\" This ancient grammar-school was given to the corporation by Queen Mary ; who were to pay to the master and under-master 13I. 6s. 8d. by four quarterly payments. This school is free to the sons of burgesses only.

It is of a quadrangular form and three stories high. This infirmary is constructed on an improved plan, contributing much to the comfort of the patients, as well as to their speedy recovery. Among the most striking advantages which it possesses, are two spacious day rooms for convalescents, in which they eat their meals and pass the greater part of the day ; a fever house under the same roof, but completely separated from other parts of the building ; a subdivision into small wards, by means of which the medical attendants are enabled to separate the diseased from each other, and to give to those whose cases may require it, the benefit of quiet and darkness ; and an excellent method of communicating warmth when necessary, and of ventilating all parts of the building. The infirmary is capable of accommodating 80 patients, besides those in the fever house. The average number is about thirty. The medical board consists of three physicians and four surgeons, besides a house apothecary. In this parish also, not far from the Infirmary, is the Ordnance-Depot, which was completed in the year 1805, from a design of the late Surveyor general of the Works, James Wyatt, Esq. The armoury on the ground floor, j 5 feet by 25, is capable of containing 15,000 stand of arms. A room above of the same dimensions, is for the reception of army accoutrements. On the north and south sides of the armoury are two magazines, capable of containing 1200 barrels of gunpowder, and constructed so as to prevent accidents.

The Agards acquired a moiety of this manor, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by purchase from Shelley. The manor now belongs to Sir Henry Crewe, Bart. In the year 1271, an agreement was made between the Abbot of Derley and Robert de Sacheverell, who claimed the patronage of Bolton as a parish church. By this agreement, in consideration of 20 marks paid by the Abbot, the said Robert gave up his claim, and admitted Bolton to be a chapel of St. Peter in Derby, the Abbot agreeing to present a fit minister, nominated by him ; and it was agreed, that the minister should have three bovates of land, nine sellions, and twelve shillings, rent, besides the 'small tithes/ The minister is now appointed by the inhabitants.

The manor, which was granted to the monks of Dei ley, iu the year i234b , was granted by King Henry VIII., in 1544, to Rowland Babington, Esq. It was purchased of the Babingtons, in 1582 or 1583, by Henry Beaumont, Esq., from whose family it passed to the Dixies, and is now the property of Mrs. Pochin, sister of the late Sir Wolstan Dixie, Bart.

It was afterwards held by the families of Hather sage and Longford, as an appendage to their manor of Kinwaldemarsh or Killimarsh. The family of Kelke possessed it as early as the reign of Henry VI. Christopher Kelke sold it, in 1551, to Robert Swift, Esq., of Rotheram. Francis Wortley, Esq., and Mary his wife, the heiress of Swift, sold it, in 1564, to Sir Francis Leake of Sutton, in whose family it continued many years. It is now the property of the Duke of Devonshire, whose ancestor purchased it, in 1 705, of the family of Pegge. The late Duke was impropriator when an inclosure act was passed in 1809: an allotment was then given in lieu of tithes. Earl Fitzwilliam is patron of the chapel, to which a perpetual curate is appointed. The manor of Totley, (Totingelei) is described in the Domesday Survey, as belonging to the King's Thanes. In the reign of Edw. 1., it appears to have been in the Longford family, as an appendage of the manor of Killi marsh.\u2122 Sir Walter Blount was seised of it in the reign of Edward IV. : it was afterwards successively in the families of Bradshaw, Leche, and Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury. The manor of Totley now belongs to Henry Lord Middleton, of Wollaton ; the whole of the landed property is divided amongst the freeholders. The parochial chapel of Holmsfield, is situated about a mile and a half from Dronfield and about six and a half from Chesterfield. In this cha pelry are the hamlets or villages of Cartlidge, Horsley-gate, Lydgate, Mill thorp, and Unthank. The manor belonged to the Deincourts, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, and continued in that family, till the death of William Dein court, in the reign of Henry VI. ; one of his sisters and coheirs married Sir William Lovell : on the attainder of his son, Francis Lord Lovell, in the reign of Henry VII., this manor was granted to Sir John Savage. It is now the property of the Duke of Rutland, whose ancestor purchased it of the Savage family in the year 1586. The Deincourt family had a park at Holmesfield in 1330/ In the year 1717, Mr. Robert Mower gave a nouse and some closes to the Minister of Holmsfield chapel ; and, in 171 8, lands then valued at iol. per annum, towards procuring Queen Anne's bounty.

In 1725, Mrs. Prudence Mower gave 60I. to the school, on condition, that the Lord ship should make up the income iol. per annum ; and that it should be a grammar-school. The income is now 15I. per annum. At Horsley gate was an estate, which was, for nearly four centuries, the property and residence of a branch of the ancient family of Wolstenholme of Lancashire. A branch of the Eyres of Hassop resided at Horsley-gate, in the 17th century. Unthank, sometime the property and residence of the Wrights, is now a farm house, the property of Mr. John Lowe. Duckmanton, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, lies about four miles from Chesterfield. The parish contains the villages of Long-Duckmanton, in which was the church, Middle-Duckmanton, and Far-Duckmanton. Wulfric Spott gave the manor of Duckmanton to Burton-Abbey/ At the time of taking the Domesday Survey it was the property of Ralph Fitzhubert. Geffrey Fitz-Peter purchased the manor of Sir Richard de Wyverton, for Welbeck-Abbey/ Sir Richard Basset gave the vill of Duck manton to the Abbey. It appears that both these parties held under Leonia de Reynes, whose son Henry de Stuteville confirmed Duckmanton to the Abbey/ King Henry VIII. granted the manor, in or about 1538, to Francis Leake, Esq. It has since passed with Sutton, and is now the property of the Marchioness of Ormond. The impropriate rectory, and the advowson of the vicarage, have passed with the manor. There has been no church at Duckmanton within the memory of any person living: it is probable that it was pulled down about the yeas 1558, when this benefice was consolidated with the rectory of the parish of Sutton. There is a charity-school at Duckmanton, end jwed with 20I. per annum, for the education of'20 children : it is not known by whom it was founded.

The manor of Duffield (Duuelle) was, at the time of taking the Domes day Survey, part of the demesne of Henry de Ferrars. His immediate descendants, the Earls Ferrars, had a castle here, the site of which is still known by the name of the Castle-field. Duffield-Castle is said to have been garrisoned by Robert Earl Ferrars, Jun. when he took up arms on behalf of Prince Henry, against his father King Henry II. It is probable that it was one of those castles which were soon afterwards demolished by the King's command/ King Henry III., in 1266, gave this manor, with other estates of the Ferrars family, to his son, Edmund Earl of Lancaster. In the year 1330, among other claims, in answer to a quo warranto, Henry Earl of Lancaster claimed seven parks in Duffield-frith ; namely, Ravensdale, Schethull (Shottle), Postern, Bureper (Belper), Morley, and Schymyndecliff'e. The manor of Duffield became parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, to which it continued annexed till the reign of Charles I., when it was granted to Ditchfield and others. It was afterwards in the family of Leech, from whom it passed by purchase to the Jodrells, and is now the property of Richard Paul Jodrell, Esq,, of Lewknor, in Oxfordshire. The families of Wilmot and Newton had good estates and mansions at Duffield. John Balguy, Esq., one of His Majesty's Justices for South- Wales, possesses and inhabits the mansion which belonged to the Wilmots, having purchased it, with the greater part of the estate, of that family, about the year 1791. The estate which belonged to the Newtons passed afterwards to the Coapes by purchase; on the death of Henry Coape, Esq., in 1778, it devolved to Henry Porter, Esq., who took the name of Sherbrooke ; and on his death, to the late Thomas Porter Bonell, Esq., whose daughter, the lady of Sir Charles Henry Colvile, is the present proprietor. The parish church of Duffield is a handsome Gothic structure, with a spire. In the north transept is the monument of Anthony Bradshaw, Esq., of the Inner-Temple, a younger son of William Bradshaw, of Brad shaw, put up by himself in 1600.

Bassano's volume of Church Notes describes an alabaster monument of a Knight, with his effigies in armour, with the date of 1536, and the arms of Minors, which he supposes to have been that of Sir Roger Minors, of Windle-hill, in the parish of Sutton-on-the-hill ; and some memorials of the Gregsons of Turndich, then nearly obliterated; one had the date of 1681. The church of Duffield was given by Henry, Earl of Lancaster, to Newark College, in Leicester, to which it became appropriated/ The rectory manor, and impropriation, belonged for many years to the family of Pindar, who resided in the rectory house : it is now the property of their descendant, Earl Beauchamp. The Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry is patron of the vicarage, which has been twice augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty, and once by Parliamentary grant/ An ancient chantry in Duffield church was founded for the purpose of saying mass for the keepers of Duffield-frith and the town of Duffield. There was formerly a meeting-house of the Presbyterians at Duffield ; the congregation of which are now Unitarians. The General Baptists have a meeting-house here ; and the Wesleyan Methodists. There is an old established charity-school at Duffield, the revenues of which are about 70I. per annum. It appears by a renewed deed of trust, bearing date 1586, that the school was then considered an old foundation.

An estate at Holbrook is charged with the payment of a shilling a week to each pensioner ; 5s. yearly to each for fuel ; the men to have a coat, and the women a gown, once in two years. Mr. William Potterell, in 1735, gave the interest of iool. four per cent, to be divided among the pensioners/ There was another alms-house in Duffield for four poor persons, founded by Edward Potterell, of Derby, who died in 1667, and erected pursuant to his will by John Potterell, of Oakham, his executor, in 1676, as appeared by an inscription on the building/ The pensioners of this alms-house had an allo' /ance of one shilling a week each, a gown every other year, and fuel at Christmas. What were the funds out of which this endowment was paid is not now known. Nothing having been received for many years ; and the house, which was used by the parish for the residence of paupers, having become very ruinous, it was agreed by the inhabitants, at a vestry about the year 18 10, that, in consideration of the payment of a sum of money, Mrs. Bonell should be permitted to take it down and inclose its site within her grounds. Hazlewood is parcel of the manor of Duffield. The Blount family had for many years an estate there, called a manor in records of the reign of Edward iJf. and that of Edward IV. The manor of Shottle (the Sothille of Domesday) belonged to the Ferrars family, and was afterwards annexed to the Duchy of Lancaster : it was one of the seven parks within Duffield-frith. It was alienated by the crown in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; probably to the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1630, it was sold by Philip, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, to Chris tiana, Countess of Devonshire, who procured a confirmation of this manor and Postern-park, from the crown in 1661.

The Fouchers had a park here in 1330/ The manor of Wyndley is now the property of Mr. Jodrell. The family of Minors, who were pos sessed of the manor of Windle-hill in Sutton, as before-mentioned, had also lands in Wyndley in the reign of Henry VIII. Makeney, a hamlet of this parish, (Machenie), is described in the Domes day Survey as one of the manors of Henry de Ferrars. It is now consi dered as parcel of the manor of Duffield. About 700 hands are employed by Messrs. Strutt in the spinning and bleaching of cotton, at Millford, a populous manufacturing village in this parish. There is an Unitarian chapel at Millford, supported by Mr. Strutt ; who supports also a Lancasterian school, in which the numbers are about 300 : a room to accommodate about 400 is now building at IS 'illford. The girls in this school, and that at Belper, are taught to sew, cut out, &c. as well as to read and write. A chapel has lately been erected here for the Wesleyan Methodists. Whitmore, in this parish, a small liberty, some time since belonging to Matthew Smith, Esq. is now a divided property. Belper lies about three miles from Duffield, and eight from Derby. A market has been many years established at Belper, in consequence of its greatly increased population. It is held on Saturday, and is abundantly supplied with Butchers' meat, and other provisions. There are three fairs, Jan. 28, May 15, and Oct. 31, for horned cattle and sheep. Belper appears to have been a considerable village in the reign of Henry V1II/ Fifty-one persons died of the plague there in the year 1609. Its population began to increase most rapidly about the year 1776, in which the first cotton-mill was erected by the late Jedidiah Strutt, Esq. There are now four great millsd belonging to this family at Belper; which till lately employed about 1350 hands. The manufacture of nails has been long carried on at Belper ; but is now very much on the decline. b Quo Warranto Roll. c About forty houses in Belper were destroyed, or much damaged, by a violent tempest, in 1545- See p. 161, note. * With several smaller buildings, attached to them for the various purposes of the manufacture.

The manor of Belper, then called Beaurepaire, belonged to Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, who died in 1296. The inquisition taken after his death describes a capital mansion then belonging to that Earl ; and as this is the earliest record in which there is any mention of the manor, it is not improbable that it originated in his inclosing of a park, and building a hunting-seat, to which, from its beautiful situation, he gave the name of Beau-repaire, afterwards corrupted to Belper.

Sixty-four children are taught here in day-schools, and 650 in Sunday schools, on Mr. Lancaster's plan, at the expence of Messrs. Strutt6, who are building a school-room capable of containing 500 children. Eight hundred children attend the Sunday-schools supported by the Calvinists and Wesleyan Methodists. There is no charity-school at Belper belonging to the Church establishment. An alms-house for two poor persons was founded at Belper by Mr. Mat thew Smith, of Derby, in 171 3, and endowed with land, then 81. per annum in value/ Mr. John Sims built two cottages for the habitation of poor persons, and in the year 17 19 endowed them with 12s. per annum. Heage, alias High-edge, lies about five miles from Duffield, upon the road from Chesterfield to Derby. The manor, which had been parcel of the Earldom and Duchy of Lancaster, was granted, with Duffield, to Ditchfield and others.

A branch of the Poles had formerly an estate and mansion at Heage : the coheiresses of this branch married Frith and Chaworth : the estate was sold in parcels. The Thackers had an estate also in this chapelry, and an old stone mansion called Thacker-hall. The family still remains, but in a reduced state : the estate was the property of the late Henry Richardson, Esq., of Derby. The chapel is annexed to the vicarage of Duffield, to which it is a chapel of ease. This chapel was destroyed by the tempest of 1545 s, and rebuilt. It has been at several times augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty and Parliamentary grant, to the amount of 2000I/ There was formerly a congregation of Presbyterians at Heage : the meet ing-house is now occupied by the Independents. Holbrook, lies about two miles to the north-east of Duffield. The manor appears to have been the only estate in Derbyshire belonging to the Earl of Derby which was not seised by King Henry III. on account of his rebellion.' Nevertheless Edmund, Earl of Lancaster was possessed of it at the time of his death, in 1296. In the reign of Charles I., it was pur chased of the crown by certain copyholders, who held under the Duchy.

Killamarsh, a parochial chapelry, lies about three miles from Eckington and ten from Chesterfield. Killamarsh, is described in the record of Domesday by the name of Chinewoldemaresc, as having two manors ; one of them belonging to Ascoit Musard, the other to the King's Thanes. We have not been able to trace both these manors. We find that Philip de Dovecote held a manor in Killamarsh in the reign of King John ; Cecily Meynell, in the succeeding reign ; and in that of Edward II. Hugh, son of William de Kinwaldmarsh : but at a later period, we find no record of any other manor of Killamarsh, than that which was held in the reign of Henry II. by the family of Hathersage, and passed in moieties to the Longfords and Goushills, as representatives of that family. Sir Ralph Longford died seised of a moiety of this manor in 1513. Sir William Holies died seised of the other moiety in 1542. In 1551, the last-mentioned moiety was sold by Sir Thomas Holies to Sir Richard Pype and George Basford : Sir Richard died, seised of it in 1587. It is now the property of Sir George Sitwell, Bart. The Hewets had considerable property in this parish, which passed by marriage to the Osbornes, but whether they were possessed of the manor, we have not been able to ascertain. The manor of Killamarsh was held by the tenure of providing for the King's army in Wales, a horse of the value of 5s., with a sack and a s spur, for four days.

The manor of Edensor (Ednesoure) was in the reign of Edward the Confessor the joint property of Levenot and Chetel ; when the Survey of Domesday was taken it belonged to Henry de Ferrars. The mesne signiory was for several generations, at a remote period, vested in the ancestors of the Shirley family. The immediate possession appears to have been in the Foljambes, whose heiress brought Edensor to Sir Robert Plumpton. Sir William Plumpton, grandson of Sir Robert, died seised of it in 1480. His daughters and coheirs married Sotehill and Rocliffe. A moiety of this manor passed by marriage to the Cliffords, and was sold by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, to the Countess of Shrewsbury. Sir Ralph Langford, who it is probable purchased of the Sotehills or their heirs, died seised of the other moiety in 1513/ The whole is now the property of the Duke of Devonshire. The manor of Pilsley has passed with that of Edensor. In the parish church are the monuments of Henry Cavendish, Esq.\", of Chatsworth, who died in 1616 ; his younger brother William, the first Earl of Devonshire, who died in 1625 ; and John Beton, an attendant on Mary ' Thoroton's Nottinghamshire, p. 344. u See Collins's Memoirs of the Cavendish Family.

The Duke of Devonshire is impropriator of the tithes, and patron of the donative. There is a school at Edensor, founded, in 1734, by Mr. John Philip, for poor children of Edensor, Pilsley, and Beeley ; and endowed with a moiety of the rent of land directed to be purchased with the sum of iool.

Wil liam Peverel held it for the King, when the Survey was taken. The manor of Chatsworth was for several generations in the family of Leche or Leech. John Leche, Esq., one of the King's surgeons, was of Chatsworth, in the reign of Edward III. This family became extinct about the middle of the sixteenth century. Chatsworth was sold by Francis Leche, who died in or about the year 1550, to the family of Agard, of whom it was purchased by Sir William Cavendish. Sir William Cavendish, who may be said to have been the founder of the two noble houses of Newcastle and Devonshire, was son of Thomas Cavendish, who held an office in the Court of Exchequer. Here, it is probable, he attained that knowledge which qualified him to be an useful instrument in the Reformation. The eminent talents and zeal which he displayed in this important work appear to have gained him the favour of his Sovereign, and to have raised him to considerable honours and pre ferments/ In 1530, he was made one of the commissioners for visiting religious houses ; and in 1539, one of the auditors of the newly erected Court of Augmentations : as a reward for his good services to the crown, in these employments, besides some valuable grants of abbey lands, he was, in 1546, made Treasurer of the Chamber, was knighted, and admitted of the Privy Council. Sir William Cavendish died in 1557. It is well known, that his last wife, (the heiress of Hardwicke) and widow of Robert Barley, Esq., became eventually Countess of Shrewsbury ; William, his second son, by this lady, who, on the death of his elder brother, in 1616, inherited the bulk z That the editors of the Biographia and the Peerages, have fallen into an error, by sup posing that Sir William Cavendish was author of the Life of Cardinal Wolsey, and in conse quence (as the author of that work asserts of himself, ) an attendant on that celebrated minister, and indebted to his patronage for the events which led to his subsequent elevation, has been ably shown by the Rev. Joseph Hunter of Bath, in an anonymous tract published in 1814, en titled, \" Who wrote Cavendish's Life of Wolsey?\" This writer, among other reasons which would almost have been conclusive as presumptive evidence, has shown that the author of,Wol sey's life, could not have been Sir William Cavendish, because he represents himself as having had a wife and family during his attendance on the Cardinal 5 whereas, Sir William Cavendish, most probably was not married till after the Cardinal's death ; his first child certainly was not born till four years after, as appears by Sir William's funeral certificate at the Heralds' College. It is shown that not only Lord Herbert had asserted George Cavendish to have been the author of Wolsey 's Life, but that Francis Thynne, the herald and antiquary, a contemporary writer, speaks of it as the work of George Cavendish. He is so called inmost of the ancient copies of the MS., and by Wanley in the Harleian Catalogue; besides which, the circumstances relating to the author which do not accord with the History of Sir William Cavendish, accord with that of his elder brother, George Cavendish, Esq., of Glemssord in Suffolk.

William, the third Earl, was, in the reign of Charles I., a zealous royalist ; his younger brother Charles was much distinguished in the field, and lost his life in the royal cause ; William, the fourth Earl, inherited his family's attachment to the house of Stuart, but when the conduct of James II. was such as brought the Protestant religion, and the liberty of his subjects in the free exercise of it, in danger, he was one of the first to project, and the most zealous to promote, the measures, which happily ended in his abdication, and the peaceable accession of the Prince of Orange to the throne of these realms. In 1 694, he was created Marquis of Harrington and Duke of Devonshire. This noble Duke and his successors have held high offices in the state, and have been successively Lord-Lieutenants of this county. William, the third Duke, who, in addi tion to other high offices which he bore, had been Lord-Lieutenant of Ire land, spent the latter part of his life in retirement at Chatsworth, and died there in 1755. Chatsworth is now the property and chief country residence of his great-grandson, William Spencer, the sixth Duke and ninth Earl of Devonshire of this noble family. The Leches had a respectable mansion at Chatsworth, with a park. Sir William Cavendish, soon after his purchase of the estate, pulled down the old hall, and began the building of, what Camden calls, a spacious elegant house, which was left unfinished at his death, and completed by his widow. This mansion, which appears to have been a quadrangular building, with turrets, was the occasional residence of Sir William Cavendish's widow, during her union with her fourth husband, George Earl of Shrewsbury. This Earl having been entrusted with the custody of Mary Queen of Scots, Chatsworth-hall acquired a more than common interest, as having been one of the prisons of that unfortunate Princess. She appears to have been resident at Chatsworth for some months in 1570, having been removed thither from Winfield-Manor. In the month of October this year, Lord Burleigh (then Sir William Cecil) and Sir Walter Mddmay, being then engaged in the preliminaries of a nego tiation between Queen Elizabeth and her royal Prisoner, remained for twenty days at Chatsworth/ Sir William Cecil, writing to the Earl after his return to Court, thanks him for \" his chargeable and lovyng interteyn ment of them.\" In this letter, he says, \" the Q's Maty is pleased y' your L. b Anderson's Life of Mary Queen of Scots, vol. iii. p. 100. shall, II"], [501, "DERBYSHIRE. 149 shall, when yow see tymes mete, suffer y' Quene to take y* ayre about your howss on horsebacke, so your L. be in co pany ; and not to pass fro\" your howss above one or twoo myle except it be on yc moores.\" c Soon after this the Queen of Scots was removed to Sheffield Castle, which was her chief residence during the ensuing fourteen years, indeed, we believe her only residence, except a few removes to Chatsworth and Buxton. It appears that she was at Chatsworth in 1573, 1577, 1578, and in 1581/ In 1577, Lord Burleigh observes to the Earl, that he thought Chatsworth \"a very mete hows for good preservation of his charge, having no town of resort wher any ambushes might lye.\"e It appears that the royal Prisoner was never removed from one house to another, without the Queen's express per mission :f in 1580, though it was much urged by the Earl and his friends, the Queen refused to permit him to go with his charge to Chatsworth, because his daughter-in-law, Lady Talbot, \" was so near lying in child bed,\" and she would not suffer any of his children to be with him \" wher this Quene g was.\" In 1577, the Queen wrote with her own hand, to thank the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury for their hospitable entertainment of her favourite minister, the Earl of Leicester, at Chatsworth/ Chatsworth old hall acquired additional interest, in an historical point of view, from having been occupied as a fortress in the civil wars, both on the side of the King and of the Parliament : it was garrisoned for the latter by Sir John Gell's forces, in 1643. After the Earl of Newcastle had taken Win field manor, he possessed himself of Chatsworth-hall in the month of Decem ber of the same year, and placed a garrison in it for the King, under the com mand of Colonel Eyre. In the month of September, 1645, tne governor of Welbeck put a fresh garrison into Chatsworth, with three hundred horse, under the command of Colonel Shalcross. About this time, Major Molanus was sent against it with four hundred foot, who besieged it fourteen days, when they received orders from Colonel Gell to raise the siege and return to Derby. Dr. Kennet in his memoirs of the family of Cavendish, after relating the circumstance of the first Duke (then Earl) of Devonshire having been pro secuted in the court of King's -Bench, and fined 30,0001., for striking Colonel Culpepper in the King's presence chamber, adds, \" it was under c Lodge's Illustrations of British History, vol. ii. p. 50. d Letters in the Cotton.

For he now contracted with workmen to pull down the south side of that good old seat, and to rebuild it on a plan he gave to them, for a front to his gardens, so fair and august, that it looked like a model only of what might be done in after ages. When he had finished this part he meant to go no further ; till see ing public affairs in a happier settlement, for a testimony of ease and joy, he undertook the east side of the quadrangle, and raised it entirely new, in conformity to the south, and seemed then content to say, that he had gone half way through and would leave the rest for his heir. In this resolution he stopped about seven years, and then reassumed courage, and began to lay the foundations for two other sides to complete the noble square, and these last, as far as uniformity admits, do exceed the others, by a west front of most excellent strength and elegance, and a capital on the north side, that is of singular ornament and service. And though such a vast pile (of materials entirely new) required a prodigious expence, yet the building was his least charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water-works, statues, pictures, and other the finest pieces of art and of nature that could be obtained abroad or at home.\" Dr. Kennet's account of the building of Chatsworth is confirmed, in most points, by the auditor's account, and a book of the artists' and tradesmen's receipts, of which we have obtained the perusal, through the permission of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. It appears that the south front of the present magnificent mansion was begun to be rebuilt on the 12th of April, 1687, under the direction of Mr. William Talman, the architect: the great hall and staircase were covered in about the middle of April, 1690, from which it appears, that the inner flank of the east side was built up im mediately after the south front. In the month of May, 1692, the works were surveyed by Sir Christopher Wren, at which time upwards of 9000I. appears to have been expended. In 1693, Mr- Talman was paid 600I. in advance, for building the east front and the north-east corner. The east front ap pears to have been finished in 1700, and in that year the old west front was pulled down. The old south gallery was pulled down to be immediately rebuilt, in 1703. In 1704, the north front was pulled down, the west front was finished in 1706, and the whole of the building not long afterwards completed ; being about twenty years from the time of its commencement, during which, however, it does not appear that the works were, as Dr. Kennet supposed, ever wholly suspended.

They were paid 190I. for painting. Monsieur Tijou, a French smith, Laguerre's father-in-law, had been engaged from the beginning of the work, to execute iron ballustrades, &c. Tijou was paid 5 2 81. for the staircase and other iron works. 1 This artist, whom Lord Orford calls N. Heude, painted jn Verrio's manner, and is said to have been one of his assistants ; he was engaged at Chatsworth six months before Verrio. k Lord Orford, speaking of Verrio, says, \" From that time (the revolution) he was for some years employed at the Lord Exeter's at Burleigh, and afterwards at Chatsworth.\" This places the time of his engagement at Chatsworth too late. The date of his engagement is Nov. 20, 1690, when he received, in London, the sum of 50I. in advance for ceilings, to be executed at Chatsworth. \" At Chatsworth,\" says Lord Orford, \" is much of his hand. The altar-piece in the chapel is the best piece of his I ever saw ; the subject, the incredulity of St. Thomas.\" In September, 1692, Verrio had finished the great chamber, stair-case, and altar-piece : he was paid 469I. for painting. 1 Highmore was serjeant-painter to King William, and uncle to Joseph Highmore, an artist in the reign of George II. m Of this artist we find' no mention in Lord Orford's wQrk. n Lord Orsord, speaking of Cibber, says, \u00ab' The first Duke of Devonshire employed him .much at Chatsworth, where two sphinxes on large bases, well executed, and with ornaments in good taste, are of his work ; and till very lately, there was a statue of Neptune in a fountain, still better. He carved there several door-cases with rich foliage, and many ornaments in the chapel, and on each side of the altar is a statue by him, Faith and Hope ; the draperies have great merit, but the air of the heads is not so good as that of the Neptune.\" We find, from Cibber's receipts that he was employed, in 1688, to make the statues of Pallas, Apollo, and a Triton, for which he had iool. In 1690, Cibber made figures for the new fountain, supposed to have been the four sea-horses, the Triton having been finished before ; and this completed the design. We find nothing of a Neptune. He received, in the whole, 310I. down to De cember 1690, after which, he does not appear to have been employed. The statues in the chapel are not particularized. In a volume of the Artists' Receipts, now at Hardwickt 3s the following memorandum of Cibber's prices, in his own hand ; he says, that the rates he had at my Lord Kingston's were ; \" For two figures in the pediment, each of them having four ton of stone in them, 70I. for one, and for both 140I., for one round statue, having a boy upon its shoulder 60I. ; for four statues which were not wrought round, 42I. 10s. od. per statue; for two dogs, 81. a piece: for 12 C\u00e6sars' heads, 5I. per head ; my Lord did after this pay for my board and wine for me and my man. And then I did two sphinxes at iol. a piece, having in them but three-fourths of a ton. For two statues as big as the life, I had 35I. a piece, and all charges borne, and at this rate I shall endeavour to serve a nobleman in free-stone.\" He made a sea nymph and other figures on his own account. * He made seven statues for the gardens, for which he was paid 44I. 18s. 6d. in"], [504, "DERBYSHIRE. 152 in 1688; Mr. Nosf, engaged in 1694; Mr.Daviessini696; and Mr/Auriol, in 1697. Mr. Thomas Young was engaged as the principal carver in wood u, in Ja- nuary, 1689. In 1691, Joel Lobb was employed in conjunction with Young. r In 1694, Nost made a statue of Ceres, for which he had 30I. (nearly Cibber's price) ; in 1696, he was paid 52I. 10s. for a marble figure and a bas-relief. There is no mention of this artist in Lord Orford's work. s In September, 1696, he was paid 24I. for a stone statue; in 1697, 130I. for three bas reliefs and three heads. This probably was the same artist who was employed also as a carver in wood. 1 His name occurs as having been paid for a statue in that year. u It has been of late years universally supposed, that most of the carving in wood at Chats- worth was the work of the celebrated Grinlin Gibbons; but we do not find the least trace of his having been employed there at all. We find, indeed, in the auditor's account, an item of the sum of 14I. 15s. paid to Henry Lobb, the carpenter, for cases which conveyed some carved work, statues, and pictures from London : and it is possible that this carved work might have been from the hand of Gibbons ; but we find no memorandum of any money paid for such a purchase. It may be supposed that the principal contractor for the carving might have employed the chisel of Gibbons in London. If none of the carving at Chatsworth be the work of Gibbons, (and the presumption is certainly against it, whilst there is no proof for it,) the consequence is that the art of carving exquisitely in wood was not confined to so few hands as generally hath been supposed. The name of Thomas Young, who was certainly during three years the principal carver in wood, is not mentioned by Lord Orford, nor those of Lobb, Davies, or Lanscroon : the latter, or a person of that name, is mentioned as a painter. The slight mention that is made of Watson is erroneous. It is remarkable that no writer, before Lord Orford published his Anecdotes of Painting, &c, ever spoke of the works of Gib- bons at Chatsworth. Dr. Leigh, who gave a particular description of Chatsworth in 1 700, soon after all the principal apartments were finished, speaks of the works of Verrio, but makes no mention of Gibbons ; nor does Dr. Kennet, when describing Chatsworth in his Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish. J. Mackey, who published a Tour through England, (the result of actual observation,) in 1724, quotes Leigh, and makes no mention of Gibbons, which seems to intimate that the carving was not then shewn as his work. It is no improbable supposition that Lord Orford, when he visited Chatsworth, seeing those exquisite productions of the chisel, so nearly resembling the well-known works of this artist at Windsor and elsewhere, concluded that they must be the work of Gibbons, of which, indeed, there appears then to have been a tradition. \" At Chatsworth,\" (he observes, in the Anecdotes of Painting,) \" are many orna- ments by Gibbons, particularly in the chapel : in the great antichamber are several dead fowl over the chimney, finely executed ; and over a closet-door a pen, not distinguishable from real feather. When Gibbons had finished his works in that palace, he presented the Duke with a point cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his own head, all preserved in a glass case in the gallery.\" It has been said, that Samuel Watson, who was a native of Heanor, in Derbyshire, executed some of the finest specimens of natural history in the carved works at Chatsworth. It is certain that he engaged, jointly with Lobb and Davies, to execute the ornaments of the state"], [505, "DERBYSHIRE. 153 Young. In September, 1 692, Lobb, William Davis, and Samuel Watson, con- tracted on behalf of Young, with whom Lobb appears to have been then in partnership, each of them to do a third part, for carving the ornaments for the great chamber *, in limetree, for 400I. It appears that this was not finished in August, 1 694. Mr. B. Lanscroon was employed as a carver, in March, 1 696 : in September that year he was paid 42I. for carving the festoons in the gallery/ In July, 1697, Watson was employed on the capitals and pihsters of the gallery. In September, 1698, he was paid, for carving the ornaments of the gallery and the gallery-chimney, 33I. Watson carved most of the orna ments in stone on the outside of the west front ; in 171 1 he was employed on the library cornice, and making mask heads in alabaster for the lower dining room, &c. Monsieur Nedauld z executed the ornaments of the great frieze for that front. There is nothing to confirm the tradition that the apartments occupied by Mary Queen of Scots were preserved when the house was rebuilt ; on the contrary, it appears the whole of the south and east fronts was then taken down. There is no doubt, however, that the rooms which now bear the name of the royal prisoner occupy the site of those which she inhabited; and that what is called her bed-room is furnished with the same bed and tapestry. Chatsworth-hall forms nearly a square, containing a court on the inside, in the middle of which is a fountain, and a colonnade on the north and south sides. The south front is 190 feet in length, enriched with pilasters of the Ionic order, resting on a rustic base ; the whole surmounted with a ballus trade. The west front is 172 feet in length, with similar enrichments, and also a pediment supported by half columns of the same order. Elevations state apartments; and his epitaph in Heanor church, where he was buried in 1715, claims for him the merit of some of the best of these carvings : \u2014 \" Watson is gone, whose skilful art display'd To the very life whatever nature made.

It appears that he worked under Young ; and afterwards on his own account: his price for day-work was 3s. iod. a day.

The dancing gallery, 90 feet by 22, has lately been fitted up by the present Duke for a library; and a great number of books d, from his Grace's extensive and valuable collection at Devonshire-house, have been already removed thither. The old gardens, which were laid out by George London, were begun in 1688 : the grand parterre at the south front was contracted for in June, 1694, by London and Wise/ The water-works, which were constructed under the direction of Mon sieur Grilles, a French artist, were begun in 1690, when the pipe for the great fountain was laid down. They were executed by Mr. Cock, a plumber from London, who made the artificial tree in 1693. These water works being still kept up, exhibit almost an unique specimen of what seems then to have been considered as a necessary appendage to a noble mansion; and they are on a scale commensurate to the magnificence of the building. Those at Bretby, which were on a smaller scale, have been many years destroyed. The great fountain at Chatsworth throws the water 90 feet in height ; another throws it to the height of 60 feet. Dr. Kennet relates of the celebrated Marshal Tallard, who was taken on the plains of Hochstedt, near Blenheim, by the Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, and remained seven years a prisoner in this county, that having been invited by the Duke of Devonshire to Chatsworth, and nobly enter tained by him for several days, he was said to have parted from him with this compliment \u2014 \" My Lord, when I come hereafter to compute the time of my captivity in England, I shall leave out the days of my enjoy ment at Chatsworth.\" 1 PI. 75 and 76. b PI. 72, 73, and 74. e Engraved by Kip, from a drawing by L.

Chatsworth-house stands near the foot of a steep hill, finely covered with wood, and at a small distance above the Derwent, which runs through the park in a rich and well-wooded valley, bounded by the Peak mountains. On the point of the hill, behind the house, is a tower, about 90 feet high, called the Hunting-Tower ; another ancient tower, within a moat near the river, is called the Bower of Mary Queen of Scots, and is said to have been her favourite place of retirement whilst she remained at Chatsworth. Edlaston, in the hundred of Appletree, and in the deanery of Ashborne, lies about three miles south of Ashborne. The hamlet or village of Wyaston is in this parish. The manor of Edlaston was given to the prior and convent of Tutbury, by Robert Earl Ferrars, son of the founder/ After the reformation, it was granted by King Henry VIII., in or about 1543, to William Lord Paget, who the next year conveyed it to Sir Edward Aston, Knt. This Sir Ed ward, or a son of the same name, died seised of it in 1596. At a later period it belonged to the Eyres of Hassop, and was sold by Rowland Eyre, Esq., to Mr. Daniel Morley, of Ashborne, of whose devisee in trust it was purchased by the ancestor of the Rev.

In the month of March, 1 644, there was a battle on Egginton-heath, between the royalists and Sir John Gell's forces, commanded by Major Molanus and Captain Rodes. The Royalists are said to have been defeated, and to have been driven across the Trent/ The manor of Egginton (Eghintune), which had belonged to Tochi in the reign of Edward the Confessor, is stated in the Survey of Domesday to have been held, at the time of the survey, by Azelin, under Geoffry e See the confirmation of it by Robert Earl Ferrars, the younger, in Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. i. p. 354.

This moiety is now the property of Edward Sacheverell Chandos Pole, Esq., of Radborne. Ermitrude, the other coheiress of Fitz- Walkelin, married Sir William de Stafford, whose son Robert left five daughters coheiresses ; in consequence of which this moiety became divided into several shares. These having been re-united by purchases, were vested in the family of Lathbury. A coheiress of Lathbury brought this moiety to Robert Leigh of Whittield, in the parish of Glossop, descended from the Leighs of Adlington, in Cheshire. On the death of Sir Henry Leigh of Egginton, in the reign of James I., this estate passed to his daughter and coheir Anne, married to Simon Every, Esq., of Chard, in Somersetshire, who was created a Baronet in 164 1. It is now the property, and Egginton hall the seat, of his descendant, Sir Henry Every, Bart. The greater part of Egginton-hall was destroyed by fire in the year 1736, and soon afterwards rebuilt : the late Sir Edward Every made considerable additions to it. The manor of Hargate, formerly called Heath-house, is supposed to have been a portion of the original manor, not granted by Willia'm Fitz-Ralph to his nephew William de Grendon : it was afterwards successively the pro perty of the Frechevilles and the Babingtons of Dethick. It was purchased of the latter by the Leighs, and has since been annexed to their moiety of the manor of Egginton, being now the property of Sir Henry Every.

Part of the hamlet of Cresswell is in this parish. The manor of Elmton belonged to Walter Deincourt when the Survey of Domesday was taken ; and it continued in that family till the death of William Lord Deincourt, in 1422. Ralph Lord Cromwell, who married one of his sisters and coheirs died seised of this manor in 1454; his sister and heir brought it to Sir William Lovell. On the attainder of Francis Lord Lovell, in 1485, it was granted to Sir John Savage. Sir Francis Rodes became possessed of this manor in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; and it is now the property of his descendant Cornelius Heathcote Rodes, Esq., of Barlborough. The church of Elmton was given to the priory of Thurgarton in Not tinghamshire, by Ralph Deincourt, the founder. Mr. Rodes has the im propriation, and is patron of the vicarage. Elmton was the birth-place of the celebrated Jedidiah Buxton, a day labourer'; who, with the most uncultivated understanding, possessed very wonderful powers of calculation, -and a singularly retentive memory, aided by which alone, he solved the most difficult problems, in the midst of labo rious employments and in the most numerous assemblies. Many specimens of Buxton's extraordinary arithmetical performances are to be found in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1751, 1753, and 1754. Among other instances, we are told that he measured most accurately the extensive manor of Elmton by striding over the land, and brought Sir John Rodes the contents, not only in acres, roods, and perches, but in square inches; and afterwards, for his own amusement, reduced them into square hairs' breadths/ Jede diah Buxton was born on the 20th of March, 1707; and buried in the church-yard of this his native place, March 5, 1772. There is an engraved portrait of him, taken from a drawing made by Miss Hartley in 1764. \u25a0 Notwithstanding the humble occupation of this extraordinary man, it is most probable that he was descended from the ancient family of Buxton, of Buxton. His grandfather, John Buxton, was a clergyman, and is said to have been vicar of Elmton (though no record of him is to be sound in the parish register) ; his father was the parish schoolmaster. His total want of education (for he could neither read nor write) has been attributed to his excessive stupidity when a child, and an invincible unwillingness to learn any thing. k Gent.

The manors of \u00c6lvoldestun (Elvaston), Emboldestune (Ambaston), and Torulfestune (Thurlston), which had belonged in the reign of Edward the Confessor to Tochi, were held, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, by Geoffry Alselin. This Geoffry was ancestor of the Baronial family of Hanselyn whose heiress brought this manor and the rest of the barony to the Bardolfs. It afterward belonged to the family of Blount Lord Mount joy ; and at a later period to the Stanhopes.1 It was one of the seats of Sir John Stanhope (father of the first Earl of Chesterfield), who died in 1610, having settled the Elvaston estate on Sir John Stanhope, his eldest son by his second wife. Thomas Stanhope, Esq., of Elvaston, grandson of Sir John Stanhope the younger, had three sons : William, the youngest, who succeeded to the estate on the death of his elder brothers, having been employed in many important negotiations with foreign courts, was created a Peer in 1729, by the title of Baron Harrington. He afterwards twice filled the office of one of the principal Secretaries of State, and was, in 1742, created Viscount Petersham and Earl of Harrington. Elvaston is now the property of Charles Earl of Harrington, his grandson. Elvaston-hall, then the seat of the Lady Stanhope, is said to have been plundered in the month of January, 1643, by Sir John Gell's soldiers, who demolished a costly monument newly made for Sir John Stanhope, and com mitted great outrages in the family vault.\u2122 Mrs. Hutchinson speaks of this as the act of Sir John Gell himself, and attributes it to personal enmity against the deceased.

In one of Miss Seward's letters is a very interesting account of the conduct of Mr. Morn pesson, the worthy Rector, who, in spite of all intreaty remained at his post, daily visiting and praying with the sick ; and to avoid spreading the infection, performed divine service and preached twice a week to his parishioners in the open air from a rock, which the inhabitants still call Lucklet-church.

That monastery acquired considerable landed property in Charls- worth, Chunall, and Simondly, in the years 1307 and 1308. There is now a cattle fair at Charlsworth on the 25th of April. The chapel at this place belonged formerly to the establishment, and in the Liber Regis it is described as a chapel of ease to Glossop ; but more than a century ago, it was, by permission of the Howard family, in the hands of the Presbyterians. In 1716, Mr. John Bennet left the interest of 20I. for the benefit of the Presbyterian minister at Charlsworth. The chapel, which has been lately rebuilt, is now in the hands of the Independents. Near Gamelsly is the Roman camp, called Melandra castle. e Pilkington dates the rise of its manufactures from the year 1784: he says that the first cotton-mill was erected that year. There are now fifty-six cotton-mills in the parish, bein-r half of the number of cotton-mills in the whole county.

The late Mr. Hague, who died in 1786, founded a school at Whitfield, the endowment of which is about 40I. per annum. An act of parliament for inclosing lands in the township of Whitfield passed in 18 10. The chapelry of Hayfield contains the hamlets or townships of Great- Hamlet, Phocide and Kinder, Ollersett, Beard, and part of Thornset. The hamlets of Bugsworth and Brownside, and part of Chinley, in the southern part of the parish of Glossop, are esteemed also to be within this chapelry. The village of Hayfield, which lies about five miles from Chapel-en-le-Frith, is in the township of Phoside and Kinder. In the vale between New mills and Hayfield are three calico print-works. There are annual fairs at Hayfield, May nth for cattle, horses, and sheep; and July 23d for sheep and wool. The rood-loft in the chapel remains entire, but the upper part has been modernised ; on the front is a painting of the crucifixion, with St. Peter and St. John, which bears the date of 1775.

Great-Hamlet, Phoside or Foreside, and Kinder ; and the hamlets or vills of Chinley, Bugsworth, and Brownside, are within the manor of High-Peak, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. The manor of Beard belonged to the ancient family of Beard, of Beard hall, and passed with the heiress of Richard Beard, the last of the elder branch to two brothers of the Leigh family, to whom she was succes sively married : the Leighs appear to have been succeeded by the Dun calfes. John Earl of Shrewsbury was possessed of this manor in the reign of Henry VIII., and it has passed with Ollersett and Eyam to Lord George Cavendish. Beard-hall is now a farm-house. Ollersett-hall, for merly the seat of the Bradbury family is now a farm-house, belonging to Mr. George Newton. The chapelry of Mellor lies about eight miles south-west from Glossop, on the borders of Cheshire, and about the same distance from Chapen-en-le- Frith. It comprises the vills, hamlets, or townships, of Mellor, Lud worth, Chisworth, Whittle, and part of Thornsett. The greater part of the populous village of New-mills, is in the hamlet of Whittle and in this chapelry : the villages of Raworth, Marple-bridge, and Mellor-moor-end, are also in this chapelry. Mellor and Whittle are part of the Lordship of Longdendale, on lease to the Duke of Devonshire. A subordinate manor of Mellor belonged, at an early period, to the ancient family of Mellor, one of whose coheiresses married Stafford in the fourteenth century. In the year 1704, Thomas Stafford of Stockport and Tristram, his son sold the manor of Mellor, and Bothams-hall in Mellor, to James Chetham, Gent.r whose great-grandson, Thomas Chetham, Esq., of Highgate in Middlesex, sold the Bothams-hall estate, in 1787, to Samuel Oldknow, Esq., the present proprietor. Mr. Oldknow has large cotton works at Mellor, which employ between 400 and 500 hands. Mellor-hall, anciently the seat of the Mellor family, and afterwards of the Radcliffes, was purchased in .1686, by James Chetham, Esq.

In the chapel and chapel-yard at Mellor are recorded several instances of longevity/ The minister of the chapel is appointed by trustees acting under the will of the late John Thornton, Esq., of Clapham. The appointment was in the Chetham family, and was purchased by Mr. Thornton of Thomas Chetham, Esq., in or about the year 1787. The income of the minister, which is now rather more than iool. per annum, arises partly from the rent of seats, and partly from augmentation. Queen Anne's bounty was first procured for it about the year 1764, when 200I. was contributed by Thomas Chetham, Esq., and other inhabitants of the chapelry. In 1792, it had an augmentation of 200I. by lot : in 1809, Miss Shaw of Mellor, bequeathed the sum of 200I., for the purpose of procuring the bounty a third time. These sums have been laid out in the purchase of lands, parcel of the Mellor-hall estate, as above-mentioned. The Independents have a small meeting-house at Marple-bridge in this chapelry. Thomas Walklate having left by will the sum of 160I. for founding a charity school at Mellor, with that and other smaller sums, certain closes were purchased in the reign of Charles II., now let at 25I. per annum. Seven of the principal inhabitants are trustees. In the year 1345, Thomas le Ragged enfeoffed John Foljambe of two thirds of the manor of Chisworth m ; in 1360, the whole manor was conveyed by Richard Foljambe and Robert de Holt to the Abbey of Basingwerk \u00b0 : it has since been considered as parcel of the manor of Glossop. Ludworth is also parcel of that manor. Gresley, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley, and in the deanery of Repington, lies south of the Trent, about four miles from Burton, and about six from Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

King Henry VIII. granted the site, in 1 543, to Henry Criche, and within a few years it passed successively to Richard Appleton and John Sey mour. In the year 1556, Sir Christopher Aleyne, Knt., purchased this estate with the manor of Church-Gresley, of the Seymours. The site of the priory, of which there are no remains, was adjoining to the parish church. Sir Christopher Aleyne above-mentioned, was son of Sir John Aleyne some time Lord Mayor of London, who by his will, bearing date 1545, be queathed his collar of S.S. of fine gold, to his successors, to be worn during their mayoralty on condition of their attending his obit. John Aleyne, Esq., his descendant died seised of the manor of Church-Gresley and the Priory estate in 1712, leaving his only son, Samuel, then a minor, who died without issue in 1734. This estate was afterwards in the Meynells, of whom it was pur chased, about the year 1775, by Sir Nigel Gresley, Bart, grandfather of Sir Roger Gresley, Bart., the present proprietor. In the parish church are monuments for the families of Aleyne p, and Gresley/ Sir Roger Gresley is impropriator of the tithes and patron of the donative curacy. The manor of Castle-Gresley belonged, from a very early period, to the ancient family of De Gresley, who had a castle at this place, whence it obtained the name of Castle-Gresley. The site is distinguished only by the inequalities of the ground ; there were some remains of the buildings in Camden's time. At Drakelow, the present seat of the family, they had also a residence at a very early period.

George Gresley was installed a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Anne Boleyne, in 1534 ; his great-grandson of the same name was created a Baronet in 161 1 ; Sir George Gresley was an active officer in the Parliamentary service during the civil war, and was Lieutenant-Colonel to Sir John Gell. Sir Roger Gresley is the eighth and present Baronet. Drakelow, the ancient seat of the Gresley family, is at present unoccupied. Besides the manors of Church and Castle-Gresley, and Drakelow, Sir Roger possesses those of Linton, Swadlincote, Donisthorpe, and Oak thorpe- The manor of Linton (Linctun) was part of the estate of Henry de Ferrars. It was afterwards in the Segraves, from whom it passed, succes sively, by female heirs, to the noble families of Mowbray and Berkeley. In or about the year 1568, it was purchased of Henry Lord Berkeley by Sir William Gresley. The manor of Swadlincote or Swartlincote (Sivardingescote) was one of the manors of Nigel de Stafford at the time of the Domesday Survey. His grandson, Robert de Gresley, gave it to his brother Eugenol in \"exchange. Two of the coheiresses of Eugenol de Gresley, seem to have married Verdon and Grim. The last-mentioned family was possessed of two-thirds of Swadlincote in 13 16. In or about the year 1363, Sir John Gresley gave lands and rents in Swartlincote, to the prior and convent of Gresley ; and it is probable, that they became possessed of those two-thirds of the manor which belonged to the Aleynes, who, as before mentioned, were possessed of the priory estate not long after the Reformation. Having been pur chased of the Aleynes by the Gresley family, it is now the property of Sir Roger Gresley, Bart. The remaining third was sold by Verdon to Finderne in 1304 ; in 1558, William Finderne, Esq., died seised of this estate, being described as the manor of Swadlincote, and held of the heirs of Sir George Gresley, by the annual render of a sparrow-hawk, which shows that the Gresley family had continued to be superior Lords of Swadlincote from the < Chart.

It is now the property of Bernard D'Ewes, Esq. Donisthorpe (Durandestorp) and Oakthorpe (Achetorp) were manors belonging to Nigel de Stafford, at the time of the Domesday Survey. The family of De Aula, called also Durandesthorp or Duranthorpe, are described as Lords of Donisthorpe in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth cen turies/ It is probable that they held under the Gresley family, who appear to have been the sole lords, in 1518, both of this manor and of Oakthorpe. John Savage was Lord of Oakthorpe about the year 1200, probably, as holding under the Gresley family ; he left two daughters, coheirs. Henry Earl of Huntingdon had a manor in Oakthorpe in 1642, now belonging to the Mar quis of Hastings. Donisthorpe and Oakthorpe are partly in the parish of Measham, and partly in that of Nether-Seal in Leicestershire. The manor of Heathcote or Hathcote in this parish, (Hedcote) was held, at the time of the Domesday Survey, with Drakelow, by Nigel de Stafford. In the reign of Edward II., it was in the family of Grim. In or about the year 1363, Sir John Gresley gave lands and rents in Hathcote to the prior and convent of Gresley, who it is probable afterwards became possessed of the manor. It was certainly in the Aleynes, who were possessed of the priory estate not long after the Reformation, and was sold, in the year 1728, by Sa muel Stevenson Aleyne, Esq., toDevereux Littleton, Esq., and Shore, Esq.

The manor of Hartington belonged to the noble family of Ferrars. On the attainder of Robert de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, it was granted to Edmund Earl of Lancaster ', who had a capital mansion or castle at Hartington in the reign of Edward I. The manor continued to be annexed to the Earldom and Duchy of Lancaster till the year 1603, when it was granted by King James to Sir George Hume, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Having reverted to the crown, it was granted by the same monarch, in 1617, to Sir George Villiers. In the year 1663, it was purchased of the Duke of Buckingham, by William Cavendish Earl of Devonshire, and is now the property of his descendant the present Duke of Devonshire. The Duke is by far the greatest land-proprietor in this extensive parish ; and among other estates, is possessed of Biggin-Grange, and Heathcote, which had been given to the monks of Gerondon by the Ferrars family\u2122 ; the manor or grange of Pilsbury and Cronkston-Grange, which had been given by the the same family to the abbey of Merivale in Warwickshire, and had been granted to George Earl of Shrewsbury ; the manor of Foxlow which had belonged to the family of Lovell, and Cotes-Grange, which had been granted by Henry VIII. to George Cotton. When William Earl of Devonshire was created a Duke, he took his second title of Marquis of Hartington from this place. Hartington-hall was the property and residence of the Bateman family in the early part of the sixteenth century. The estate now belongs to their descendant, Sir Hugh Bateman, Bart. The hall is occupied as a farm house. A capital messuage and estate at Hurdlow belonged for several gener ations to the family of Brereton, one of whose coheiresses, about the year 1681, brought it to the family of Swan.

Hartshorn, in the hundred of Repton and Gresley and in the deanery of Repington, lies near the road from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Burton on-Trent; three miles and a half from the former and seven from the latter. The manor of Hartshorn (Heorteshorne) belonged, at the time of taking the Domesday Survey, to Henry de Ferrars. The prior and convent of Repton had lands and a moiety of a park in Hartshorn/ The abbot of Crokesdon, in 1273, held an estate here under Theobald de Verdon \u00b0, who seems to have been possessed of the manor. We find nothing further relating to it till the year 1504, when John Ireland held the manor of Hartshorn Upper-hall under William Abell, and Nether-hall under the Earl of Shrewsbury/ Sir William Compton died seised of it in 1528.

On the borders of Leicestershire, in this parish, was a small manor called Short- Hazles, which belonged to the Royles, and was afterwards divided into severalties. In the parish church is the monument of Humphrey Dethick, Esq., of Newhall, who died in 1599 ; his widow married Sir Humphrey Ferrers. Bassano's volume of Church Notes mentions the monuments of Hugh Royle, Esq., of Short-Hazles, 1602 ; and Ann, wife of James Royle, Esq., 1630. The Earl of Chesterfield is patron of the rectory. The learned and eloquent George Stanhope, D.D., Dean of Canterbury, was a native of Hartshorn, where he was born in March, 1661 ; his father, the Reverend Thomas Stanhope, being then Rector. The Reverend Stebbing Shaw, the historian of Staffordshire, succeeded his father in the rectory of Hartshorn, in 1799 *- he died in London in 1803, and was buried at Hartshorn. There is a free-school at this place founded by William Dethick, Rector of Hartshorn, in 1626, and endowed with lands now let at about 50I. per annum. Hathersage, in the hundred and deanery of High-Peak, lies about eight miles from Tideswell, and about five from Stony-Middleton, where is a post-office. The parish contains the townships of Hathersage, Bamford, Outseats, and Nether-Padley ; and the chapelries of Derwent and Stony- Middleton.

In 1589 Sir Thomas Fitzherbert complains to the Earl of Shrews bury, that his house and estate at Padley had been seized, in consequence of two seminary priests having been found harboured there unknown to him/ This manor, or reputed manor, belonged afterwards to the Ashtons, and is now the property of their representative, Ashton Ashton Shuttle worth, Esq., of Hathersage. In the parish church are monuments of the family of Eyre \\ and some memorials also for that of Ashton/ The church of Hathersage (Hersege) was given to the Priory of Launde, in Leicestershire, by Richard Bassett, its founder, in the 12th century. In the year 1808, an act of parliament passed for inclosing the open fields and wastes in this parish, containing about 10,000 acres. At this time the Duke of Devonshire was entitled to the tithes of corn, wool, and lambs, in Hathersage and Outseats, and of wool and lambs in the township of Derwent : lands were given by the act in lieu of tithes. The Duke of Devonshire is patron of the vicarage, Benjamin Ashton, Esq., who died in 1725, gave iool. towards procuring Queen Anne's Bounty ; William Archer, Esq., gave 50I., and 50I. more was raised by subscription. Mr. Ashton gave iol. 10s. towards building a school-house, and 5I. per annum for the education of poor children. The present income of the school is about 61. per annum.

This school has now an income of about 61. per annum. The patronage of the chapel was sold by John Balguy, Esq., now of Duffield, to the late Joseph Denman, M.D. ; and it now belongs to his nephew, Thomas Denman, Esq. The parochial chapelry of Stoney -Middleton is situated about six miles from Hathersage, on the road from Chesterfield (from which it is eleven miles distant) to Manchester. The manor belonged at an early period to the Chaworths, under whom it was held by the Bernakes of Upper-Padley. Richard de Bernake sold it, in the reign of Edward I., to Thomas de Fur nival. It has ever since passed with the adjoining manor of Eyam, and is now the property of Lord George Henry Cavendish. The principal landed property is vested in the different freeholders. In the chapel are memorials of the family of Finney (1704 \u2014 1790.) The late Dr. Joseph Denman married one of the daughters, and eventually sole heiress, of Richard Finney, Esq., and possessed the estates which had be longed to that family. The minister of the chapel is appointed by the vicar of Hathersage. The Presbyterians have a meeting-house at Stony- Middleton.

Sir John Zouch was a younger son of William Lord Zouch, of Har ringworth. The Codnor estate was sold by Sir John Zouch and John Zouch, Esq., his heir apparent, in 1634, to Archbishop Neile, and his son, Sir Paul. Their descendant, Richard Neile, Esq., sold the manor and castle of Codnor, with its members E, and the manor of Codnor-park, in 1692, to Sir Strensham Masters, who was High-Sheriff in 1712.

The manor, which was given by Robert de Ferrars to the monks of Gerondon, in Leicestershire, was probably granted to the Shrewsbury family. The Earl of Shrewsbury possessed it in 1588; it is now the property of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. Oldcotes, or Owlcote, in this parish, near Sutton, was one of the three mansions built by Elizabeth Countess of Shrewsbury. This man sion and estate passed with one of the Earl of Shrewsbury's grand daughters to the Pierrepont family. It appears, by Blome's Britannia, that Oldcotes was, in 1673, the seaf \u00b0^ George Pierrepont, Esq., grand son of the Earl of Kingston. The house was taken down before the memory of any person living : the estate is the property of Earl Manvers.

The manor of Hope, which was parcel of the ancient demesne of the crown, appears to have been of considerable extent, and to have had seven hamlets annexed to it at the time of taking the Domesday Survey. It was afterwards considered as parcel of the great manor of the High-Peak ; and that manor having been since divided into two, it is now esteemed parcel of the manor of Castleton, held on lease under the duchy of Lancaster, by his Grace the Duke of Devonshire.

This well-known writer had been tutor to the second and third Earls of Devonshire ; and continued to reside in the family till his death. For many years he spent his summers in Derbyshire, removing with the family as they visited Chatsworth or Hardwick. The five last years of his life were spent wholly in Derbyshire. Among his numerous publications was a Latin descriptive poem on the wonders of the Peak, \" De Mira bilibus Pecci.\" A few weeks preceding his death, his situation being then hopeless, the Earl of Devonshire removing with his family from Chatsworth p John Lowe, Esq., 1771, (he married the heiress of Marriot, of Alscot, in Gloucestershire ;) Richard Lowe, Esq., (the last of the family,) 1785.

The church of Hault-Hucknall was appropriated to the priory of Beau chief. In 1544, the impropriate rectory was granted to Francis Leake, Esq. The Duke of Devonshire is now impropriator and patron of the vicarage.

The dilapidated shell of the ancient hall at Hardwick, which re mains by the side of the more modern structure, built by the heiress of Hardwick (then Countess of Shrewsbury) in her last widowhood, has been already spoken of. The present hall, which has acquired an imaginary interest, on the supposition that it was one of the prisons of Mary Queen of Scots, was built after the death of that unfortunate princess. The second floor of this mansion is said to have been allotted for the resi dence of the royal Prisoner, and the rooms are shown as retaining their furniture in the same state as when she inhabited them. Over the door of a bed-room, said to have been appropriated to her, are the arms of the Queen of Scots with her cypher.

We have only presumptive evidence that the unfortunate Mary ever was at Hardwick ; it is certain, that if she was, it was only during a short and occasional visit of the Earl of Shrewsbury to that place. The Countess, being at Hardwick, in 1577, several years before the present hall was built, wrote to the Earl, intimating her wish, that he would come to Hardwick, if the Queen would give him permission. In the postscript she says, \" Lette me here how you, your charge, & love dothe, & comende me, I pray you.

Hardwick-hall stands on an eminence, in an extensive and well wjoded park/ Near Hardwick-hall is a school, built by the second Duke of Devonshire in 1724. We are informed that the then Duchess of Devonshire, and a gentle man whose name is not now known, gave 200I. each, in lieu of which, 20I. per annum was charged on the Hardwick estate, a moiety of which is pay able to this school, and the other moiety to the school at Edensor. Mr. Thomas Whitehead of Rowthorn, in 1 729, gave a messuage and twenty-acres of land, now let at 16I. per annum, to this school ; 10s. of which is to be laid out in books, and the remainder to be given to the master. Mr. John Philips, in 1734, gave 50L, 4 per cents, to this school. The manor of Rowthorn (Rugetorn) was, at the time of taking the Domes day Survey, the property of Roger de Busli.

Ilkeston, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch and in the deanery of Derby is a small market-town on the borders of Nottinghamshire, nine miles from Derby, eight from Nottingham, and one hundred and twenty eight from London. The market was granted, in 1251, to Hugh de Can telupec, to be held on Thursdays, with a fair for two days at the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The market has not been wholly discontinued ; it is still held occasionally on Thursdays, sot fruit and vegetables. There are two cattle fairs, on the sixth of March and Thurs day in Whitsun-week. The hamlets or villages of Cotman-hay and Little-Hallam are in this parish. The manor of Ilkeston (Tilchestune) was, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, held by one Malger, under Gilbert de Gand, nephew to William the Conqueror. This Gilbert, in the reign of Henry I. gave the manor of Ilkeston to his steward, Sir Robert de Muskam. After four descents the heiress of Muskam married Sir Ralph de Greseley, of Greseley in Nottingham shire.

The Reverend John Slater and Mary his wife, in the year 1686, gave rive closes at Kirk-Ireton to the parish, directing that 81. per annum should be given to a schoolmaster for instructing sixteen poor children in reading, writing and arithmetic, the remainder of the rent to be distributed half yearly among the poorer inhabitants. The executors of John Bower gave the sum of 120I. for educating of poor children in 1744. Certain lands in Kirk-Ireton and Callow, in the parish of Wirksworth, were inclosed by act of parliament in 1803. Kedleston, in the hundred of Appletree and in the deanery of Derby, lies four miles north-west from Derby. The manor of Kedleston (Chetelestune ') was, at the time of taking the Domesday Survey, part of the large property of Henry de Ferrars : it was held under the Ferrars family by that of Curson or Curzon, as early as the reign of Henry I. This ancient family frequently represented the county of Derby in parliament. Sir John Curzon was created a Baronet in 1641. Sir Nathaniel Curzon the fifth baronet was, in 1760, created Baron Scarsdale of Kedleston, and was father of Nathaniel Lord Scarsdale, the present Lord of the manor of Kedleston. Kedleston-hall, the noble mansion of Lord Scarsdale, and his chief residence, stands pleasantly situated in the midst of the park, occupying the site of a former mansion, which had not been built many years when Mr. William Wolley wrote his MS. history of Derbyshire in 171 2, and which that writer describes as a very useful noble pile of building, of brick and stone, as good as most in the county. The present hall, which is the object of great attraction to travellers, was built from the designs of Adam, about the year 1765. The hall of this mansion is a singularly fine room, about 6y feet by 42, supported by twenty Corinthian columns, twenty-five feet in height, which were much improved in their effect a few years ago, by being fluted.

She relates, that being then Major Sanders, he was, by Cromwell's management, (to the exclusion of Colonel Hutchinson,) made colonel of the regiment which had been commanded by Colonel Thornhagh, killed in the fight near Preston in Lancashire. She adds, Cromwell \" had a design by insinuating himself into Colonel Saunders, to flatter him into the sale of a town of his called Ireton, which he earnestly desired to buy for Majqr-Gencral Ireton, who had married his daughter, and when at last he could not obtain it in process of time, he took the regiment away from him again.\" Mrs. Hutchinson must have been misinformed as to the particulars of this transaction. Ireton, as is stated above, was the ancient patrimony of Major-General Ireton; and it seems probable that he sold it to Colonel Sanders. The Editor of Mrs. Hutchinson's memoirs rather supposed Ireton to be in the Vale of Belvoir, but it is clear that it was in Derbyshire, as he observes it was said to have been.

The manor was from a very early period the property, and Kniveton was the original residence, of the ancient family to which it gave name : this family spread into two branches, settled at Bradley and Mercaston : Kniveton, the original patrimony of the family, was sold by Sir Andrew Kniveton, Bart., in the reign of Charles II., to Lowe, from whom it passed to the Pegges. In the reign of Queen Anne, it was sold by Thomas Pegge, Esq., to Mrs. Meynell, of Bradley, and is now the property of her descendant Godfrey Meynell, Esq. The rectory of Kniveton was anciently appropriated as parcel of Ash borne, (to which, in remote times, it was a chapel,) to the Deans of Lincoln, one of whom conveyed it to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield. In 1548, the Dean and Chapter granted the rectory-house, glebe, tithes, &c. (reserv ing only the ecclesiastical jurisdiction), to Ralph Gell, Esq., of Hopton. In 1796, this estate was sold by the devisees, in trust, of the late Philip Gell, Esq., to Mr. Edmund Evans, of Derby, and others : the tithes have been since sold to the several land owners ; Mr. Evans is patron of the perpetual curacy. In the year 17 15, Mr. John Hurd gave lands for the endowment of a school at Kniveton, which, in 1787, when the return of charitable donations was made to the House of Commons, were let at 9I. per annum, 81. of which were given to a master, and 15s. per annum for coals.

Earl Stanhope, in 178 1, sold it to the late Thomas Evans, Esq., in whose family it still continues. There are no remains of the hospital, or of the chapel of St. Nicholas. The manor of Bentley (Beneleie), commonly called Hungry-Bentley, belonged to Henry de Ferrars when the Survey of Domesday was taken ; afterwards to the Blounts, Lords Mountjoy ; and at a later period to the Brownes, who had a seat there.

The manor of Markeaton (Marchetone) is described in the Domesday Survey as having been the property of Siward, and then held by Gozelin, under Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. In the year 1251, Thomas, son of Robert Tuschet, had a charter of free warren here/ The Tochets, or Tuchets, claimed a park at Markeaton, and a gallows for the execution of criminals in 1330. In or about the year 1516, JohnTuchet, Lord Audley, sold the manors of Markeaton and Mackworth to John Mundy, citizen of London, who was Lord-Mayor in 1522.

Mapleton, or Mappleton, in the wapentake of Wirksworth, and in the deanery of Ashborne, lies in a valley on the banks of the Dove, about a mile and a half from the town of Ashborne. There are two manors in Mapleton : one of these belonged at an early period to the Bassetts of Blore, whose heiress brought it to William Ca vendish, Duke of Newcastle. It was sold by his descendants, in 1757, to Thomas\" Rivett, Esq., of whom it was purchased by the Rev. John Taylor, L.L.D., of Ashborne. This manor is now the property of Dr. Taylor's devisee, William Webster, Esq., of Ashborne. The other manor was at an early period in the family of Wendesley, or Wensley, afterwards in the Cokaines : the last-mentioned family possessed it for several generations. This estate, which we are informed is not now esteemed a manor, belonged afterwards to the family of Trott. It is now the property of R. F.

An old mansion, which belonged to the ancient family of Wakelyn, and which before the year 171 2 had been purchased by Mr. John Gisborne, is now the property of Mr. Spurrier : the estate which was annexed to it has been sold in parcels. At Hilton was formerly a chapel of ease, of which there are no remains. Ernulf de Bee, at a very early period, being lord of the manor of Hilton, and Thomas de Piru gave three bovates of land to the church of Marston, for the privilege of having this chapel, and agreed that the inhabitants of Hilton should go on certain festival days to the mother church of Marston/ The manor of Hogan, or Howne, now called and written Hoon, (the Hoge of the Domesday Survey,) was held, when that Survey was taken, by Saswalo, or Sewall, ancestor of the Shirley family, under Henry de Ferrars.

His son, Sir Charles Pye, was a great traveller, and visited Egypt and the Holy Land. The two sons of Sir Charles, Richard and Robert, successively enjoyed the title and estate. The title became extinct on the death of Sir Robert, the younger, (who was in holy orders,) in 1734. Sir Robert Pye bequeathed the manor of Hoon to his three daughters, none of whom appear to have been married at the time of his decease : it is probable that one of them afterwards married Watkins, as we find that Hoon passed by inheritance to a family of that name. It was purchased of the late Captain Watkins by Mr. W. J. Lockett, who has since sold it in severalties. The old mansion of the Pyes is occupied as a farm house by its present proprietor Mr. Orme. Matlock, in the wapentake of Wirksworth, and in the deanery of Ash borne, lies about four miles north-east from Wirksworth. The parish and township are co-extensive. The principal villages in the parish are, Matlock, Matlock-baths, Matlock-bank, Harston b, and Ryber. There are four fairs at Matlock, Feb. 25, April 2, May 9, and Oct. 24, for cattle, swine, sheep, and pedlars' wares. The fair which is now held on the 2d of April was formerly held on the 16th of July : it was altered by the lords of the manor in 1810, at the request of several neighbouring farmers and dealers. The manor of Matlock is described in the Survey of Domesday as parcel of the King's manor of Mestesforde, the site of which is not certainly known, but is supposed to have been at a place now called Nestes or Nestus, a little mining village at the foot of a high hill on the north side of the old bath. Matlock is supposed to have belonged at an early period to the Ferrars family, as parcel of the wapentake of Wirksworth. It is certain that it was successively parcel of the earldom and duchy of Lancaster. It continued attached to the duchy till the year 1628, when it was granted to Edward Ditchfield and others, in trust for the corporation of the city of London, by whom, in the following year, it was conveyed to John Middle ton and three other persons, as trustees for the copyholders of the manor. The rights of the manor have ever since been vested in a succession of such trustees for the proprietors, some of whom are possessed of copyhold and fteehold lands, and others of freehold lands only. The present trustees 6 In Burdett's map written Hearthstone. I are,"], [559, "DERBYSHIRE. 207 are, Bache Thornhill, Esq., Philip Gell, Esq., of Wirksworth, and John Toplis, Esq. The beautiful scenery of Matlock, and its springs and baths, have been already spoken of. The waters were first applied to medicinal purposes about the latter end of the seventeenth century. The old bath, which was of wood, lined with lead, was made in 1698. The proprietor then procured a lease from the lords of the manor. In process of time the accommo dations were improved ; a stone bath was constructed ; two new springs were discovered; new baths were formed; lodging-houses erected, and carriage-roads made. Matlock-baths have long been a favourite summer resort, great numbers being attracted to it, as well by the beauties of its sceneiy as by the celebrity of its waters. The parish church contains no monument of note, except that of An thony Wolley (who died in 1578-), and Agnes his wife. Bassano's volume of Church Notes mentions the monument of Anthony Wolley, who died in 1668, and memorials of Henry Smith, Rector, \" Divinus, medicus, mu sicus,\" 1640, and of some of the family of Hayward/ The Dean of Lincoln is patron of the rectory. There is a meeting-house of the Independents at Matlock-bath. Mr. George Spateman, of Tansley, in the year 1647, gave the sum of 80L, for the purpose of founding a free-school at Matlock, and 20I. for the use of the poor. This money was laid out in a messuage and lands at Al freton, exchanged a few years ago for a messuage and other lands at Mat lock, which exchange was confiimed by an act of parliament passed in 1 8 1 2. This house and land are now let for 24I. per annum, four-fifths of which is paid to the schoolmaster. Mr. Anthony Wolley, in 1668, gave 5I. per annum to this school, and directed that a piece of land should be set apart for that use ; which having been neglected to be done, a commission of charitable uses was applied for on the part of the charity, and two pieces of copyhold land, now let for 19I. 10s. per annum were set apart for the use of the school. On the inclosure of Matlock common, an allotment was made to the school in right of these lands ; which allotment is now let for 5I. per annum.

This lady settled it upon her nephew, Sir Darcy Dawes, Bart., son of Archbishop Dawes. Sir Darcy 's daughter and heir having brought it to Edwin Lascelles, Esq., afterwards Lord Harewood, it was sold by him, in 1778, to Mr. Edmund Hodgkinson, tenant of the estate, who soon afterwards resold to Thomas Hallett Hodges, Esq. Of the latter it was purchased, in 1782, by Richard Arkwright, Esq. This gentleman, by his extraordinary skill in mechanics, applied to the im- provement of the art of spinning cotton, rendered an important service to his country, and raised himself from an humble origin to the possession of a princely fortune. He first established his cotton-works at Cromford, about the year 1770. In 1786 he received the honour of knighthood. In 1788 he built on this estate a large gothic mansion, called Willersley, situated on a knoll which overlooks the Derwent : before it had been inhabited it was reduced to a shell by an accidental fire, on the 8th of August, 1791. Sir Richard Arkwright died in 1792. Willersley is now the property and seat of his son, Richard Arkwright, Esq., M.P. The walks at Willersley, cut out in the woods which overhang the Derwent, command views of the most picturesque scenery in the vicinity of Matlock-bath. At Willersley are several paintings by Wright of Derby ; among which are a portrait of Sir Richard Arkwright, and a view of Ulswater, which was purchased by Mr. Arkwright at the price of 300 guineas. An estate called the Coumbs and the Bough-wood, in the south-east part of this parish, passed by marriage from the family of Wakebridge to that of Pole.

Sir Thomas Chaworth gave Greenhill in Norton, for the support of an additional canon as before-mentioned.

The abbey estate is now the property of his descendant, Peter Pegge Burnell, Esq., who has assumed the latter name. Beauchief-hall, built by Mr. Pegge in the reign of Charles II., at a little distance from the Abbey, is at present in the occupation of Broughton Stead, Esq. It is probable that the Strelleys, who were of Beauchief Abbey, resided in a mansion fitted up out of the Abbey, or built on its site. There are now no remains of the monastic buildings except a part of the chapel, which was fitted up as such for the district by Mr. Pegge, in the reign of Charles 11/ In this chapel are memorials of the families of Strelley and Pegge/ On the floor are memorials of the Jacksons, (1666,1667.) The benefice is a donative, with no settled income. There was a chantry of eight priests at Beauchief, besides the canons of the convent.

In the time of the Saxons it was called Repandum, and was the capital of the Mercian kingdom. Before the year 660 \\ there was a nun nery at this place, under the government of an abbess, in which Ethelbald and other of the Mercian monarchs were interred/ The Danes having driven Buthred, King of the Mercians from his throne, wintered at Repandum in 874/ It is probable that the nunnery above-mentioned was then destroyed. The manor of Repton (Rapendune) was part of the royal demesne when the Survey of Domesday was taken. It soon after belonged to the Earls of Chester. Maud, widow of Ranulph de Blundeville, Earl of Chester, who died in 1153, founded a priory of black canons at Repton in 1172, or, rather, in that year, removed them thither from Calke, where they were first established. This priory was dissolved in the year 1538, when its revenues were estimated at 11 81. 8s. 6d. clear yearly income. The site of the priory was granted by King Henry VIIL, in 1540, to his servant, Tho mas Thacker, Esq., who had taken possession of it for the King's use in 1538, and purchased most of the furniture and stock. The furniture of the high altar, and of St. John's, St. Nicholas's, St. Thomas's, \" Our Lady's,\" \" Our Lady of Pity's\" chapels, with the images, &c. sold for fifty shillings : the grave-stones were not then sold, nor the buildings/ It appears that there was a shrine of St. Guthlac at this priory, to which was a great resort of pilgrims, and his bell was applied to the head by superstitious persons, tor the cure of the head-ach/ Fuller relates in his Church History, on the authority of his kinsman, Samuel Roper of Lincoln's-Inn, that one Thacker being possessed of Repingdon-abbey in Derbyshire, \" alarmed with the news that Queen \u00ab Edburga, daughter of Adulph, King of the East-Angles was at this time abbess of Repton.

Gilbert Thacker, Esq., the last of this family, died in 1712, leaving an only daughter, who bequeathed the priory estate to Sir Robert Burdett, Bart., grandfather of Sir Francis Burdett, Bart., the present proprietor. The remains of the priory have been converted into the school-room, and offices belonging to Repton school. The mansion, which was the seat of the Thackers, is rented of Sir Francis Burdett by the governors of the school, and is occupied by the head master, Dr. Sleath. The manor of Repton was divided among the coheiresses of Ranulph de Blundeville, Earl of Chester, and passed through various hands in severalties. The capital messuage of Repingdon was taken into the King's hands in 1253/ Before the year 1330, the greater part of the manor appears to have passed into other hands from the representatives of the Earls of Chester. John de Britannia, William de Clinton, and Julia his wife', the prior of Repingdon, Robert de Becke, Philip de Strelley, William de Handesacre, Emma, relict of Robert de Tateshall z, John Swinnerton, and Christian, relict of John de Segrave8, were then joint owners. No mention is made in the record b of the Baliols ; yet it appears that Mary de St. Paul, Countess of Pembroke, who inherited from the Baliols, gave her share (one-third of a fourth) of the manor of Repingdon, to the master and scholars of Pem broke-hall, (of her foundation,) and that the college exchanged this share with the priory of Repton, for a rent-charge issuing out of the manor of Grantesden in 1411 or 1412/ Before the year 1330, Bernard Brus, as * Originalia, 38 Hen.

In the reign of Henry IV., John Finderne was seised of an estate called the manor of Repingdon alias Strelley's part/ It is most probable that the Finderne family became possessed of most of the lay shares, by purchase or inheritance, for except in one instance, we find no mention of any other manor than that of the priory, and the manor of Repton, which passed with the heiress of Finderne to the Harpurs, about the year 1558, and is now the property of their descendant, Sir Henry Crewe, Bart. There was an extensive park belonging to this manor, the paling of which still remains. In the year 1554, William Westcote conveyed the manors of Repington and Willington to Sir John Porte. This was probably that part of the manor which belonged to the Segraves, and passed by inheritance to the Mowbrays. The last-mentioned family possessed also the manor of Willington. This estate at Repton became afterwards parcel of the endowment of the school and hospital founded by Sir John Porte. The proprietors of the manor in 1330 claimed to be lords of the hun dred, and to have within their manor a pillory, tumbrell, and gallows, for the punishment of criminals: they claimed also by prescription a market at Repton on Wednesdays, and a fair on the first of July/ Both these have lonjr a<ro been discontinued.

The church of St. Wistan, at Repton, was given to the priory, with all its chapels, at the time of its removal from Calke. The rectorial estate belongs to Sir Henry Crewe, Bart., who is patron of the donative curacy. The parish was inclosed by act of parliament in 1766. In the year 1556, Sir John Port devised all his estates in Lancashire and Derbyshire, in trust, for the foundation and endowment of a grammar school at Repton, and an hospital at Etwall. The Harpur family had the direction of these institutions till the year 162 1, when Sir John Harpur conveyed the superintendence to the Earl of Huntingdon, Lord Stanhope, and Sir Thomas Gerard Bart., as right heirs of the founder. The present hereditary governors are, the Marquis of Hastings, the Earl of Chester field, (now a minor), and Sir William Gerard, Bart. In the year last-men tioned the master of Etwall hospital, the schoolmaster of Repton, the poor men, and poor scholars, were made a body corporate. The establishment at Repton consists of a head master (the Reverend John Sleath, D.

The improved rent of the estates, which are now about 2500I. per annum, have long enabled the governors to increase the number of pensioners in the hospital, to augment the establishment of the school at Repton, and to give larger salaries to the masters. The governors elect the master of the hospital, and the master and ushers of the school : the Harpur family have, by the original charter, a fourth turn with them in the appointment of the pensioners of the hos pital and the foundation-scholars. Mr. Thomas Whitehead gave some land at Repton for the head master's use. Some land at Ticknall, now let at 5I. per annum was given for the purchase of books : the name of the donor is unknown ; but it is supposed to have been Philip Ward, a former master.

Lillington Lewis, M. A., the translator of Statius ; and the late F. N. C. Mundy, Esq., author of the elegant poems of Need wood Forest, and the Fall of Needwood. Mrs. Mary Burdett, in 1701, gave the sum of 200I., and Mrs. Dorothy Burdett, in 1718, the same sum, for buying bread for the poor, and clothing and teaching poor children of Repton, Ingleby, and Foremark. The parochial chapelry of Bretby lies about three miles from Repton. The manor of Bretby, which had belonged to Earl Algar, was part of the royal demesne when the Survey of Domesday was taken. It afterwards belonged to the Earls of Chester, and passed with a portion of the manor of Repton to the Segraves. Nicholas de Segrave, had a charter of free warren in Bretby in 1291.1 His son, John de Segreve, who was the King's Lieutenant in Scotland, and was taken prisoner in the battle of Bannock burn, was summoned to Parliament as a Baron in 1295. In 1300, he had the King's licence to castellate his mansion at Bretby.m Bretby Castle passed with the manor to the Mowbrays, Lords Mowbray and Dukes of Norfolk. One of the coheiresses of this noble family brought Bretby to the Lords Berkeley. Henry Lord Berkeley was possessed, in 1554. of the manors of Bretby Collet and Bretby Preposita. From whence these names originated we have not been able to discover, not having observed the name of Collet among any records relating to the chapelry. In 1585, the castle and manor of Bretby were purchased of the Berkeley family by Sir Thomas Stanhope, grandfather of Philip, the first Earl of Chesterfield. In the year 1639, a masque, written for the occasion by Sir Aston Cokaine, was performed before this Earl and his second Countess, at Bretby, on Twelfth- Day. In the month of November, 1642, the Earl of Chesterfield fortified his house at Bretby, and garrisoned it with 40 musketeers and 60 horse. Sir John Gell, having intelligence of it, sent 400 foot, with a party of dra goons and two sacres, under the command of Major Molanus. Sir John Gell relates, that after a short defence the Earl and his party fled through the park towards Lichfield ; that they took in the house 7 drakes, 30 steel pikes, 20 or 30 muskets, 5 double barrels of powder, and good store of ' Chart.

The Bretby estate now belongs to George Augustus Frederick, Earl of Chesterfield, a minor, who succeeded to the title and estate on the death of Philip the late Earl, in 18 15. Bretby Castle, the site of which is still discernible near the church, is said to have been standing in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; and we are informed by Mr. C. Burton, steward of the late Earl of Chesterfield, that it was then inhabited by Mr. John Mee, lord of the manor, and Mary his wife, and that he has seen a receipt for a rent payable to them by the Stanhope family. In the year 1569, Henry Lord Berkeley had demised the manor and castle of Bretby for 41 years to Thomas Duport ; and it is probable that this John Mee might have married his heiress, in which case they would have been jointly seised of the manor, &c, till the expiration of the above-mentioned lease. Mr. Burton, on taking up the foundation of the castle-walls found that it was a building of great strength, and consisted of two large courts. The old mansion at Bretby park, which most probably was built by the first Earl of Chesterfield p, was pulled down by the late Earl in the year 1780. There is a view of it, drawn by Knyff and engraved by Kip, in the \" Nou veau Theatre de Grande Bretagne.\" Mr. Wolley, in his MS. account of Derbyshire (17 12), speaks thus of Bretby. \" The seat of the Earl of Chesterfield is situated in the midst of a very large park, well wooded and stored with several kinds of deer, and exotic beasts ; there are several fine avenues of trees leading to the house, which is of stone, though not of the modern architecture, yet very regular, convenient, and noble, with a very curious chapel, and very good outbuildings ; but the gardens, fountains, labyrinths, groves, green-houses, grottoes, aviaries, but more especially the n This spirited lady was daughter of the loyal Sir John Pakington. 0 Sir John Gell's MS.

It appears by the life of John Hieron, an eminent non-conformist divine, that he preached a weekly lecture on Fridays in the chapel at Bretby, for Catherine, Countess of Chesterfield/ His biographer relates as an anecdote of this Countess, that she claimed precedence for her gentlewoman above Baronets' daughters, and that the Earl-Marshal, on being appealed to, gave it in her favour. Bretby-hall is a castellated mansion, of a quadrangular form, which had been several years in building, and was left unfinished at the death of its noble owner, in 18 15. The greater part of it had been fitted up and inhabited: the building has been since discontinued. The park is well wooded, and in some parts exhibits varied and picturesque scenery. On the east side of the house is preserved a fine cedar of Lebanon, which probably is the oldest tree of the kind in the kingdom. It appears by the gardener's bill, still in the Earl of Chesterfield's possession, that it was planted in the month of Fe bruary, 1676-7. We find by Evelyn, that the cedar had not been brought into this country in 1664. The Enfield cedar was planted about the same *> The water-works were began to be constructed in the year 1684, and finished in 1702, most probably by the same artist who constructed those at Chatsworth. They consisted of numerous jets-d'eau, one of which, from a dragon's mouth, was thrown to the height of 50 feet. On the east side of the house was an oblong piece of water; in the centre of which was a lofty pedestal, supporting a statue of Perseus: from the sides of the pedestal issued numerous jets-d'eau, forming arches round its base. In this water were dolphins, swans, and other animals, all throwing up jets-d'eau. The orangery was very extensive, its large and lofty trees all growing in the natural soil, the conservatory having a lofty roof, and sides of glass, removable in the summer. These gardens appear to have been preserved complete, with the water-works, &c, till 1780, when they were all destroyed with the house. (From the mformation of Mr. Charles Burton.)

The late Earl of Chesterfield, who resided wholly at Bretby during the latter part of his life, and dedicated a considerable portion of his time to agricultural pursuits, had one of the most complete farming establishments in this part of England. Plans and elevations of the farm-yard and offices are given in the second volume of Farey's General View of the Agriculture of Derbyshire. The chapel of Bretby, with the tithes of the chapelry, were parcel of the rectory of Repton, which belonged to the priory at that place. It passed with one of the coheiresses of Port to the family of Hastings, and seems to have been brought into the Stanhope family by the marriage of the first Earl of Chesterfield with a daughter of Francis Lord Hastings. The minister of Bretby chapel, which is a donative, is appointed by the Earl of Chesterfield. The late Earl and Countess of Chesterfield supported a school for 30 boys, and another for 30 girls ; in which the children were clothed, and instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic. These schools are still kept up by the trustees, at the request of the young Earl and his sisters. The parochial chapelry of Foremark lies nearly two miles to the east of Repton, and about seven miles from Derby. The manor, called in the Survey of Domesday and other ancient records Fornewerche or Fornewerke, belonged, when that Survey was taken, to Nigel de Stafford. In the reign of Henry II. it was given by Robert de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, to Ber tram de Verdon, in marriage with one of his daughters/ It seems to have continued in a younger branch of this family, after the extinction of the elder branch in 13 16 ; for we find that John de Verdon had a grant of free warren in Foremark in 1327. It was purchased of the Verdons\" before the year 1387, by Sir Robert Francis, who obtained a confirmation of free warren from the crown in the year 1397/ The heiress of Francis married Thomas Burdett, Esq., of Bramcote, in Warwickshire, who was created a Baronet in 161 8. In consequence of this marriage, Foremark has been ever since the chief country seat of the Burdett family ; but the present possessor, Sir Francis Burdett, Bart., one of the representatives for West minster, has not resided there for several years.

At Knowle-hill, a little to the south-west of Foremark, was a house built by a younger son of the first Baronet, and sold by him to the Hardinge family. It was repurchased by the late Sir Robert Burdett, who inhabited it while Foremark-hall was rebuilding. This house was afterwards pulled down. There is a singular rock, about a quarter of a mile north-east of Foremark, having at a distance the appearance of a ruin, with a rude door-way which leads to several cells or excavations : it is called Anchor-church, and is said to have been the residence of a hermit.

The fair, which was held on the 1 2th of November O. S., was some years ago noted for the sale of mares and foals : the fair also has been discontinued. In the parish church are two ancient monuments of ecclesiastics, without inscriptions; that of Roger Bothe, Esq., who died in 1467, and Catherine his wife, father and mother of Laurence Bothe, Bishop of Durham, (after wards Archbishop of Yorkz,) and of John Bothe, Bishop of Exeter; and that of Robert Bothe, son of Roger (described as brother of John Bothe, Archdeacon of Durham, afterwards Bishop of Exeter*, and Ralph Bothe, Archdeacon of York,) which Robert died in 1478.

The rectory of Sawley has been from an early period the corps of a prebend in the church of Lichfield. Cardinal Gauselin, prebendary of Sawley, claimed, in 1330, assize of bread, &c, in the rectorial manor.

In the chancel is the monument of Henry Kayes, Esq., of Hopwell, 1733 ; he married Mary, daughter of William Belasyse, of Owton, in Durham. The chapel of Little-Wilne is held with Sawley, of which the prebendary is the patron. Draycote, a populous village in this chapelry, is chiefly inhabited by stock ing-makers, and other manufacturers. The manor, which is held under the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, is in severalties. The manor of Hopwell (Opewelle) was held by Ralph Fitz-Hubert at the time of the Domesday Survey, under the Bishop of Chester. In the year 1296, it appears to have been held under the Earl of Lancaster, by Ralph de Shirley. Some pedigrees of the Sacheverell family make Patrick Sache verell to have been lord of Hopwell in the reign of Edward I. ; and they are said to have acquired it by marriage with the heiress of Hopwell ; but we find no such match recorded in any of the pedigrees of the family, nor any trace of its having been possessed by the family of Hopwell.

The chapel is held with Sawley, as a chapel of ease. The parochial chapel of Risley, in the hundred of Morleston and Lit church, and in the deanery of Derby, lies on the road from Derby to Not tingham, eight miles distant from each. Roger de Busli appears to have been lord of Risley when the Survey of Domesday was taken ; but in the same record it is stated that Levinus possessed one-third of the manor, and that he was succeeded by his son, who then held it. In the reign of Ed ward I., William Morteyne held this manor under the Pavely family. The heiress of his son Roger brought it to Sir Richard de Willoughby, one of the Justices, and some time Chief- Justice of the Common Pleas : his younger son Hugh settled at Risley, where his descendants continued for several generations. Henry Willoughby, Esq., elder son of Sir John Wil loughby, Knt., was created a Baronet in 161 1, and died without male issue in 1649. This manor became the property of Anne, one of his coheiresses by his first wifef, who married Sir Thomas Aston, Bart., and afterwards the Honourable Anchetil Grey. The manor of Risley was purchased of Sir Willoughby Aston, Bart., by Mr. John Hancock, uncle of the Rev. John Hancock Hall, who is the present proprietor. The old hall at Risley, which was the seat of the Willoughbys, has been taken down : in the gardens, which belonged to this mansion, is a terrace nearly 300 yards in length, with a hedge of box, and several remarkably fine trees of variegated holly. Woodhall park, in this chapelry, belonged to the Babingtons, of Chilwell in Nottinghamshire ; and afterwards to the Sheffield family. It was pur chased of Lord Sheffield in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by Michael Willoughby ; and having passed with the manor of Risley, is now the pro perty of Mr. Hall. The park has long ago been converted into tillage. The parochial chapel at Risley was built by Michael Willoughby, Esq., in 1593. In the chancel is a memorial for John Proudman, B.D., first master of the school, and minister of the united chapels, or as they are improperly termed churches, of Risley and Breaston, who died in 1724. The Earl of Stamford appoints the minister. The above-mentioned Michael Willoughby, and Catherine his wife, gave 20 nobles (61. 13s. 4d.) per annum, which was increased by Sir Henry Wil loughby, their grandson, to 20 marks (13I. 6s. 8d.) towards maintaining a minister and schoolmaster at Risley.

The minister of the chapel appears to have been head-master from the time of Mrs. Grey's foundation. We have not been able to learn what is the pre sent value of the endowment ; but it was returned at iool. per annum in 1787. In the return of charitable donations then made to the House of Commons, it is observed, that the grammar-school had been a sinecure for many years ; that a bill in chancery was filed in Lord Bathurst's time against the master, but it was dismissed. The grammar-school, in conse quence, remains still a sinecure. The chapel of Breaston lies one mile from Risley, and seven from Derby. The manor of Breaston (Braidestune) was held with Risley, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, by Roger de Busli. It appears to have been separated from Risley, and again united ; for we find that Michael Willoughby, Esq., purchased it of the Babingtons in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is now the property of the Rev. John Hancock Hall. Mar riages are solemnized and children baptized at Breaston, but the inha bitants have always buried their dead at Little- Wilne ; the chapel-yard at Breaston not having been consecrated. Scarcliffe, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, lies on the borders of Nottinghamshire, about two miles from Bolsover. The village of Palterton is in this parish. At the time of taking the Domesday Survey, the manors of Scarcliffe and Palterton, which had belonged to Levenot, were held by Raynouard, under Ralph Fitz-Hubert, ancestor of the Frechevilles. Lands in Scarcliffe were given to the priory of Thurgarton by Hubert Fitz-Ralph/ In the year 1275, the Prior of Newsted, in Nottinghamshire, and Robert de Grey (who had been appointed keeper of the estates forfeited by Anker de Freche ville, in consequence of his having joined the rebellious Barons) appear to * Dugdale's Monasticon, vol.ii. 92.

Sir Henry Pierrepont died seised of it in 161 6. This estate was purchased in 1690, by Sir Peter Apsley; from whom it has descended to Earl Bathurst, the present proprietor. In the parish church is an ancient monument of a lady, concerning which there are some idle traditions/ It is most probable that she was one of the Frecheville family. The church of Scarcliffe was given to Darley- Abbey by Hubert Fitz-Ralph, and appropriated to that monastery. The rectory-manor and advowson, were granted in 1544 to Sir Francis Leake. They are now the property of Earl Bathurst ; the vicarage is in the gift of the crown. The parish of Scarcliffe was inclosed under an act of parliament passed in 1726. The great tithes now belong to the land-owners ; the tithes of lambs and wool to Earl Bathurst. Four acres of land at Scarcliffe were charged by the inclosure act with buying bell-ropes for the use of the parish church. The manor of Palterton was given by Wulfric Spott to Burton- Abbey in the reign of King Ethelred. At the time of the Survey of Domesday it was held with Scarcliffe by the ancestor of the Frechevilles, and after the alienation of that manor, continued to belong to a younger branch, who had a seat at Palterton. John Ulkerthorpe, who married one of the co heiresses of this branch died seised of the manor of Palterton in 1445. John Columbell died seised of it in 1556. It was afterwards in the Leakes, and has since passed with Scarcliffe. There was formerly a chapel at Palterton. Scropton, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Derby, lies on the north side of the Trent, about eleven miles from Derby, which is the post-town. It comprises the hamlet or village of Foston. The manors of Scropton (Scrotun) and Foston (Farulueston) belonged, at the time of the Domesday Survey, to Henry de Ferrars. The paramount manor, which was afterwards in the Earls and Dukea of Lancaster, was granted, in 1628, to Wise, and others. It was purchased, in 1679, by Wil liam Bate, Esq., whose descendant, in 1784, sold it to the father of Charles Broadhurst, Esq., the present proprietor. The Agards were possessed of a considerable estate at Scropton and Foston, and probably held the manor under the Duchy as early as the year 1 3 10; their seat was at Foston.

Foston-hall is now the seat of Mr. Broadhurst. Arthur Agard, born at Foston in 1540, is spoken of by Camden as an eminent antiquary ; he was deputy chamberlain of the exchequer, and mem ber of the original Society of Antiquaries. Hearne published his Essays, read at this Society, in his collection of curious discourses. He wrote a treatise on the obscure words in Domesday-book, which remains in MS. among the Cotton collections at the Museum. Arthur Agard died in 1615. The Agards, as feodaries or bailiffs of the honour of Tutbury, were pos sessed of a horn described in the third volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia. This horn passed with the office to Charles Stanhope, Esq., of Elvaston, who married the heiress of Agard. In the parish church is the monument of Barbara, relict of the Honourable Colonel Samuel Newton, sometime of South-Winfield, after wards of the island of Barbadoes, who died in 1693 ; his son, John Newton, was of King's Bromley in Staffordshire ; his daughter Mary married Richard Bate, Esq., formerly of Barbadoes, afterwards of Foston. The rectory of Scropton was appropriated to a chantry in the parish church. We find mention of the chantry of John the Baptist, founded by John Agard, Esq. Mr. Broadhurst is impropriator and patron of the curacy. Shirland, in the hundred of Scarsdale and deanery of Chesterfield, lies about eight miles from Chesterfield, near the road to Derby. The village of Higham and part of Stretton are in this parish. The manor of Shirland (Sirelunt) is described in the Survey of Domesday, as held by one Warner under Henry de Ferrars. In the reign of King John it belonged to John de Grey, a younger son of Henry de Grey, of Turrok in Essex ; and Shirland became, for some generations, the seat of this branch of the family, who were afterwards denominated De Wilton, from the principal seat of their barony. In the year 1250, John de Grey had a grant of a market in this manor on Wednesdays, and a fair for three days at the festival of St. Peter ad vincula.' The market, which was discontinued about the year 1785, was held at Higham in this parish on Friday. There is still a fair at Higham on the first Wednesday after New Year's day, chiefly for the sale of horned cattle. Chart. Rot. 35 Hen. III.

The Earl of Thanet now possesses a third of these manors, as descended from one of the coheiresses. William Turbutt, Esq., of Ogston-hall, has a third and a sixth. The remainder is divided between William Shore Nightingale, Esq., of Lea- wood house, and the family of Hopkinson of Ufton-field farm. There was a park at Shirland in 1330/ In the parish church is a handsome monument for one of the Grey family, probably that of Sir Henry de Grey, of Shirland, who was summoned to parliament as a Baron in the reign of Edward III. In the chancel are several monuments of the family of Revel, of Shirland, and of Ogston m in the adjoining parish of Morton ; and that of Jonathan Burnham, 1797. The advowson of the rectory was long annexed to the manor. Two-thirds are still vested in the Earl of Thanet and Mr. Nightingale, as annexed to their shares of the manor : the other third belongs to the heirs of the late Reverend John Bourne. The proprietors of the advowson present in rotation. Edward Revel, Esq., of Ogston, gave the site of the school. Thomas Fidler gave a rent-charge of 40s. to the schoolmaster. Mrs. Lydia Boot gave 40s. per annum to a schoolmaster to teach six children ; 3I. to be given to the children as rewards, and 20s. for books. John Laverack, Esq., gave 2I. and John Oldham, Esq., 4I. per annum. William Stock gave a cottage and croft, now let at 1 5I. per annum, for the purpose of teaching six poor children to read the bible and providing them with books. The present income of this school, which is at Hatfield-gate, is about 25I. per annum ; the number of poor children taught is about twenty. Shirley, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Derby, lies about ten miles from Derby, and about three and a half south-east from Ashborne. The parish comprises the township of Stydd and the chapelry of Yeavely. The manor of Shirly (Sirelei) belonged to Henry de Ferrars. In the reign of Henry II., it was held under the Ferrars family by the immediate ancestor of Earl Ferrars, who seating himself here, took the name of Shirley. The name of Saswallo or Sewall, the ancestor of this family, occurs in the Domesday Survey as holding manors (but not Shirley) under superior Lords.

Sir Thomas Shirley, who died in 1362, was a distinguished military character. His son, Sir Hugh, was slain at the battle of Shrewsbury. Sir Ralph, son of Sir Hugh, was one of the chief commanders at the battle of Agincourt. Their descendant, Sir George, was created a Baronet in 161 1, and his great-grandson, who, in 1677, had been declared Lord Ferrars of Chartley, in virtue of his descent from that noble family, through one of the coheiresses of Devereux, Earl of Essex, was, in 171 1, created Viscount Tamworth and Earl Ferrers. Shirley has long ceased to be the seat of this noble family : the manor is now the property of the Honourable Washington Shirley. There was formerly a large park at Shirley. In the parish church is a memorial for William Pegge, Esq., of Yeldersley, (the last of that branch of the family) who died in 1768. The church of Shirley was given to Darley- Abbey, by Fulcher de Ireton, of a younger branch of the Shirley family, and confirmed by James de Shirley, about the year 1230. Mr. Steeples is the present impropriator, and Earl Ferrers patron of the vicarage. The parochial chapelry of Yeavely lies about two miles from Shirley. Ralph le Fun, in the reign of Richard I., gave the hermitage of Yeavely to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, on condition that he should inhabit it during his life. It afterwards became a preceptory of that order, and its revenues, with that of Barrow in this county, were valued at 93I. 3s. 4d. clear yearly income. The site of Yeavely was granted by King Henry VIIL, in 1543, to Charles Lord Mountjoy, conveyed by his son James Lord Mountjoy, in 1557, to Ralph Brown, and by the latter, in 1559, to Francis Colwich. It continued a considerable time in the last-mentioned family, was afterwards in that of Hurd, and is now the property of John Walker, Esq. There are considerable remains of the chapel of this preceptory, called Stydd chapel. The manor of Yeavely belonged, at an early period, to the Meynells, (by whom lands at Yeavely were given to the Hospitallers.)

The parish is divided into Church-Somer sall or Somersall-Herbert, and Hill-Somersall. The village of Potters- Somersall also is in this parish. Church-Somersall and Somersall-Herbert belonged to Henry de Ferrars, when the Survey of Domesday was taken ; one of them was held under him by Alric. Somersall-Herbert belonged to the family of Fitzherbert from a very early period. On the death of the late Richard Fitzherbert, Esq., the last heir male of the elder branch, in 1803, it passed by bequest to his only surviving maiden sister, Mrs. Frances Fitzherbert, and on her death, in 1806, to her nephew, (being the son of an elder sister,) the Reverend Roger Jacson, of Bebington in Cheshire. Mr. Jacson sold the manor to the late Lord Vernon, whose brother, Henry Venables Lord Vernon, is the present proprietor. Somersall-hall the old seat of the Fitzherberts was purchased by Lord St. Helen's, descended from a younger branch of this family which has been long settled at Tissington. It is now in the occupation of Mr. Jacson's sisters. Hill-Somersall was, at an early period, in the Montgomery family, and has passed with Marston and other estates to Lord Vernon, who is the present proprietor.

Spondon, in the hundred of Appletree and deanery of Derby, lies about three miles and a half from Derby. The parish comprises the village of Locko, part of Burrow- Ash, and the parochial chapelries of Chaddesden and Stanley. The manor of Spondon belonged, when the Survey of Domesday was taken, to Henry de Ferrars. After the attainder of Robert de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, King Henry III. granted it to his son, Edmund Earl of Lancaster. In the reign of Edward II., the Pipards held an estate at Spondon and Chaddesden, under the Earl of Lancaster/ The manor of Spondon was granted, with that of Burrow- Ash, in 1563, to Thomas Stan hope: it was afterwards in the Gilberts of Locko, who, in 1721, sold this manor, with Chaddesden and Locko, to Robert Feme, Esq.

There is a MS. life of her, written by her husband, (now in the possession of her descendant, John Gilbert Cooper, Esq.,) by which it appears that she was a person of extraordinary charity and piety. A few observations on this MS., with extracts, will be found interesting, as throwing light on the domestic manners of the times. It appears that Mr. Gil bert was married to this lady on the 18th of February 1657-8. Their eldest son, who was born on the 21st of December following, was christened according to the forms of the Church of England, the service of which, notwithstanding the hazard then attending such a practice, was regularly performed in Mr. Gilbert's family. It appears, from several passages in the MS., that the physicians of that time always made visits, accompanied by their apothecaries, who took with them a supply of such medicines as were likely to be wanted. In 1663, Mrs. Gilbert, who had denied herself the proffered gratification of going to see the magnificent celebrity of the coronation on St. George's day, 1661, in Westminster-Abbey, accompanied her husband to London on business. They travelled with their own four horses, and arrived at their journey's end the fourth day; their lodgings were at an upholsterer's shop, the sign of the Red-cross in Fleet street, over against the conduit, and the rooms were taken at the rate of 5osh. for a fortnight. \" On Tuesday,*' says the writer, \" she din'd at the Pell Mell with my brother and 6i'ster Cooper, from thence they would needs persuade her to go see a play in the afternoon : with much difficulty she consented, and went to the Duke's playhouse by Lincolns-Inn fields; but would not goe into a box nor far into the pit, but sate at the entrance neare unto the door. I think the play was the ' Five hours adventure ;' but I remember she was very weary of it, though it was the first and last that she ever saw in her life. On Thursday she went again to my brother Cooper's house, and he took her to Whitehall to let her see the King and Quden at dinner, and to kisse their hands.\" It seems that she was so sick of the vanities of London, that she could not be persuaded to stay more than a week, notwithstanding the landlord would not abate anything of the 25s., for the second week for which their lodgings were engaged, and all her friends earnestly urged her stay. It appears that it was then customary for the gentry as well as persons of high rank to keep open Christmas. In 1663, Mr. Gilbert mentions his discharging and paying off his cook, fidler, and all supernumerary servants whom he had engaged for the Christmas, in consequence of Mrs. Gilbert's indisposition. Speaking of a journey to London in 1664, he says, \" She writ to me to buy her a white satin waistcoat, which I did, and because I bought her a laced gorget, which she knew not till I came down, she was displeased at it, and said I had bestowed too much money on her at one time, though the gorget cost but 5I , when persons of meaner quality than she wore them of above five times the value.

We find no mention of it before the existence of the hospital. A Lock was formerly used as synonymous with a lazar-house ; hence the name of the Lock-hospital in London, and an old-hospital at Kingsland near London, called \" Le Lokes.\" The deriv ation is from the obsolete French word Loques, signifying rags. The brethren of the order of St. Lazarus, had lands at Nether-Lockhay or Locko, in 1296, which had belonged to Robert le Wyne. Other lands at Locko belonged then to the families of Frecheville and Poer, all held under Edmund Earl of Lancaster/ King Edward III., in 1347, granted an annuity which had been paid by the preceptory at Locko to a superior house of the same order in France, (which annuity had been taken into the King's hands during the war) to the master and scholars of King's-hall in Cambridge towards the expence of building their house, so long as the war should continue/ In 1 544 the manor of Locko was granted to John Dudley, as having belonged to the hospital of St. Lazarus, at Burton. There was nevertheless, long before the Reformation, a lay manor at Locko. Sir Robert Grene died seised of the manor of Locko in 1388, Alice daughter of Sir Godfrey Foljambe, (afterwards wife of Sir Robert Plumpton,) being his heir/ We find the manor of Nether- Locko, belonging to the family of Birde or Bride in the reign of Henry IV. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, William Bird, Esq., sold this manor to William Gilbert, Esq., then of Barrow, who had married his father's widow, the daughter of William Coke, Esq., of Trusley.

Sir William Plumpton, who died in 1480, was seised of the manor of Chaddesden by inheritance from Sir Robert Grene before-mentioned. From one of the coheiresses of Sir William Plumpton, this manor descended to the family of Clifford, and was sold by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland to Francis Curzon. In the year 1593, Robert Newton, Esq., died seised of the manor of Chaddesden, which he had acquired of Francis Curzon, Esq., of Keddleston, leaving Thomas his son and heir. This manor has been long united to that of Locko. The prin cipal landed property belongs to Sir Robert Wilmot, Bart., whose ancestors have had their seat here for several generations. Edward Wilmot, M. D., of Chaddesden, physician to King George II., and during a great part of his reign, to his present Majesty, was created a Baronet in 1759, aud was grandfather of Sir Robert Wilmot the present Baronet.

In the reign of Edward III. a chantry was founded in the chapel of Chaddesden, for a warden and two chaplains, by Henry de Chaddesden, Archdeacon of Leicester, to the intent that divine service might be daily performed there : certain lands were conveyed as the endowment of this chantry by his executors, Sir Nicholas and Geffry de Chaddesden in 1362/ Besides the original endowment, sixty acres of land were given to the chanters at the altar of the Virgin Mary at Chaddesden, in 1380/ Robert Newton, Esq., before mentioned, died seised of the chantry in Chaddesden in !593- It appears by the register of burials, that Thomas Harris, aged 107 years, was buried February 29, 1659 : there is no mention in the register of John u Esch. 36 Edw.

The parochial chapelry of Stanley, lies about three miles and a half from Spondon and four and a half from Derby. William Fitz-Ralph, Seneschal of Normandy, having purchased the manor of Stanley from Nicholas Child, gave it to the Premonstratension canons, who had been by him removed to the present site of Dale-Abbey, (then within Stanley park.) It is probable that the manor was granted after the Reformation to the Powtrells, who were possessed of it in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and in 1624. In 1697, Joseph Vicars, Gent., sold a moiety of this manor to Paul Balidon, Esq., from whom it passed by marriage to the Cokes of Trusley. The manor aster wards belonged to the Rev.

Bassano's volume of Church Notes, describes the tomb of William Sacheverell, Esq., 1558, and Mary his wife, heiress of Clement Lowe, of Derby. Among these notes is the copy of an inscription on the chancel wall, which states, that \" having been, through fanatical profaneness, inhabited by owls and spiders, it was rebuilt for the use of Christians, by Augustine Jackson, rector, in 1682 ;\" it re minded the parishioners also of the obligation they were under by the canons of receiving the communion thrice in the year, and that any mi nister who should willingly administer the sacrament to any but such as should kneel, was liable to suspension. Sir Henry Crewe, Baronet, is patron of the rectory. Stanton-by-Dale, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, and in the deanery of Repington, lies about nine miles nearly east from Derby, on the borders of Nottinghamshire. The manor of Stanton-by-Dale, other wise Davers, belonged in the fifteenth century to the family of Mackerell/ It was afterwards in the Babingtons, from whom it passed by sale in the reign of Queen Elizabeth to Michael Willoughby, Esq.

The parish comprises the chapelry of Caldwell, and the townships of Stanton and New hall. The parish of Burton extends on the Derbyshire side of the river, and is much intermixed with Stapenhill, both in the village and else where. The manor of Stapenhill was given to the monastery of Burton by Bri teric, the second abbot ; and that of Caldwell soon afterwards by William Rufus/ King Henry VI II. gave these manors, with others, to the col legiate church which he founded on the site of the dissolved monastery ; which college being soon afterwards dissolved, the manors of Stapenhill and Caldwell were granted, in 1545, to SirWilliam Paget ; and that of Sta penhill now belongs to his descendant, the Marquis of Anglesea.

The church of Stapenhill was appropriated to the monastery of Burton, to which it had been given, with the manor, by Abbot Briteric. The Mar quis of Ajiglesea is impropriator and patron of the vicarage. The Reverend John Hieron, an eminent non- conformist divine and critic, who made collections towards a History of Derbyshire, was born at Stapen hill in 1608. The chapelry of Caldwell lies nearly four miles from Stapenhill. The manor of Caldwell was sold by William Lord Paget, in 1565, to Peter Col lingwood, Esq. ; from whose family it passed, by successive marriages, to those of Sanders and Mortimer.

The coheiresses of Darcy brought this estate to Sir Erasmus Philipps. Bart. Sir William Rokesby, Barnes, and Milward. The Earl of Chesterfield purchased the shares of the two former, and the remainder having passed into the Stanhope family, the whole was sold in parcels by the late Earl Stanhope, and his son, then Lord Mahon.

It seems to have escheated again to the crown, and to have been granted by King Henry VIIL, in 1544, to Francis Leake, who the next year con veyed it to Sir Peter Frecheville, already possessed of tworthirds by inhe ritance. In the year 1552, Henry Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, quitted claim to the third which had been in his family. Stave1/ was for many generations the chief seat of the Frecheville family. Ralph de Freche ville was summoned to Parliament in the reign of Edward I. Sir Peter Frecheville was knighted for his services at the battle of Musselborough. Sir John Frecheville, who was a most active royalist, garrisoned his house at Stavely in the civil war ; he distinguished himself on various occasions, particularly in a skirmish with Captain Revel's and two other troops, which he drove for shelter into Mr. Eyre's house at Hassop, and having procured some reinforcements, took them all prisoners. In the month of August, 1644, Stavely-house was taken by Major-General Crawford, and a party of the Earl of Manchester's army, by capitulation : it is said to have been strongly garrisoned; 12 pieces of ordnance, 230 muskets, and 150 pikes, were taken in the house/ Aster the restoration, Sir John Frecheville was (in 1664) for his good services created a peer, by the title of Lord Frecheville, of Stavely. In 168 1, a year before his death, he sold the manor and estate at Stavely to the first Duke of Devonshire, from whom it has descended to the present Duke. There was formerly a park at Stavely.

In the year 1255, was granted to Peter de Hareston/ The heiress of Robert de Hareston brought it to Richard de Grey, of Sandiacre. A coheiress of Grey, alias Hilarys brought it to the Leakes in the reign of Henry IV., and it became the chief seat of that family. Francis Leake, of Sutton, was created a Baronet in 161 1, and Lord Deincourt of Sutton in 1624. In 1643, (the beginning of April,) Lord Deincourt began to fortify his house at Sutton. Sir John Gell sent his brother, Colonel Thomas Gell, with 500 men and three pieces of ordnance, to besiege it. Lord Deincourt was summoned, but refused to surrender, and for some time obstinately defended himself. The house was taken, and Lord Deincourt and his men made prisoners : the works were demolished, and Lord Deincourt set at liberty, on giving his word that he would repair to Derby within eight days, and submit himself to the Parliament. Sir John Gell observes, that the for feiture of his word, on this occasion, was revenged by the garrison at Bol sover, who some time afterwards, when that castle was in the hands of the Parliament, plundered Lord Deincourt's house at Sutton/ In 1645, Lord Deincourt was created Earl of Scarsdale. Having rendered himself very obnoxious to the Parliament, by his exertions in the royal cause, during the civil war, his estates were sequestered ; and as he refused to compound, they were sold. His son procured some friends to be the purchasers, he paying the sum of i8,oool., fixed by the Parliamentary commissioners as the composition. The title became extinct by the death of Nicholas, the fourth Earl, in 1736. After this event, the large estates belonging to this family were sold for the payment of debts.c After an intermediate sale, Sutton was purchased by Godfrey Clarke, Esq., who was in possession in 1740. The sister and heir of Godfrey Bagnall Clarke, Esq., who died in 1786, married Job Hart Price, Esq., who took the name of Clarke, and left a daughter and heir, now Marchioness of Ormond, the present possessor of this estate. Sutton-hall, which stands on an elevated spot near the church, was built by the last Earl of Scarsdale.

There are no remains of the Countess of Shrewsbury's mansion, which was taken down, probably, after the death of Mr. Francis Pierrepont, mentioned below. In the parish church is a memorial for John Foljambe, son and heir apparent of Godfrey Foljambe, 1499 ; the monument, with his bust, of Francis Pierre pont, Esq., second son of the Honourable George Pierrepont, sixth son of the Earl of Kingston, 1707, and that of Thomas Freeman, Gent., 1684.

Robert, son of Sarle, possessed it in the reign of Henry 11/ Ralph de Rochford held it under the Earl of Lancaster, at the time of the Earl's death in 1296/ In the reign of Richard II., it appears to have been in the Mackworth family/ In that of Henry VII., it appears that the Beaumonts were succeeded by the Fitzherberts/ At a later period Ash was the property and seat of the family of Sleigh. The elder daughter and coheir of Sir Samuel Sleigh, who died in 1679, brought it to James Chetham, Esq. in consequence of the death of his sons, without issue, it passed to the family of Cotton of Bellaport in Shropshire, into which the other coheiresses married, and is now the property of William Cotton, Esq., of Etwall. John, who is supposed to have been ancestor of the Montgomery family, gave half the tithes of his demesne of Osleston and Nether-Thurvaston, to Tutbury priory.

This bridge, which is con structed so as to secure a passage over the low grounds, usually flooded in the winter, was originally not more than eleven or twelve feet in width, and the old parts, chiefly over the arches, still continue of that width ; but it has been widened, wTherever there has been occasion to rebuild or repair, so that carriages can now pass each other at very small intervals. The span of the bridge over the river\" is only 138 yards, but the whole length is little less than three quarters of a mile (1304 yards.) It appears by an inquisition taken in 1503, that there was an ancient chantry chapel on Swarkston bridge, endowed with some meadow land, lying between Swarkston-bridge and Ingleby/ About the latter end of the year 1642 or the commencement of 1643, Colonel Hastings fortified Sir John Harpur's house at Swarkston, and threw up some works at the bridge, to secure the passage of the Trent.

Thorpe, in the wapentake of Wirksworth and deanery of Ashborne, lies about three miles from Ashborne, in a picturesque situation not far from the entrance of Dovedale. The remarkable conical hill called Thorpe cloud is in this parish. The manor was in the crown when the Survey of Domesday was taken. Ralph de Hormanwell was seised of it in 1245. was afterwards in the family of Wythen, from whom it passed to the Cokaines. John Cokaine, Esq., possessed it in 1359 ; his descendant sold it, about the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, to John Milward, Esq., of Bradley-Ash, from whom it descended to Charles Bowyer Adderley, Esq., the present proprietor. Hunsdon or Hanson-grange in this parish, which had been given, in the reign of Henry III., by Roger de Huncyndon, to the monastery of Burton on-Trent1, was granted by Henry VIIL to Sir William Pagett, and con veyed by him, in 1546, to John Flackett, whose descendant sold it, in or about the year 1638, to Robert Boothby, Esq. Some time afterwards it was in the family of Borrow, of Castlefield near Derby, by whom the house and some of the lands were sold to Mr. William Gould, the present pro prietor.

The small village of Biggin is in this parish. The manor of Tibshelf (Tibecel) was held by one Robert under the King, at the time of the Domesday Survey, when William Peverell is said to have been keeper of it for the crown. In the reign of King John, it was in the baronial family of Heriz, from whom it passed by successive female heirs, to Belers and Swillington. R. de Swillington was seised of it in 1429/ There was aster this a great law-suit between Lord Cromwell and the Pierrepont family, about the inheritance of the estates which had be longed to the Heriz family ; the latter succeeded as to this manor, and Sir William Pierrepont was possessed of it in 1513/ It now belongs to St. Thomas's hospital, to which it was given by the founder, King Edward VI , in 1.552, being then described as parcel of the endowment of the dissolved Hospital of the Savoy. The parish church was rebuilt in 1729. The church of Tibshelf was appropriated to the Nuns of Brewode in Staffordshire in 1315/ The impro priation is now vested in St. Thomas's Hospital. William Allwood Lord, Esq., is patron of the vicarage.

The parish comprises the townships of Litton and Westown or Wheston : the chapelry of Wormhill, and the villages of Timstead and Hargate-wall. The market at Tideswell was granted to Paulinus Bampton in the year 1250 f, to be held on Wednesdays, together with a fair for two days at the festival of the Decollation of St. John the Baptist/ There was a confirm ation of this grant to Richard Stafford about the year 1392, and to Sampson Meverell in 1432/ The market is still held on Wednesdays for butchers' meat, &c.

Six acres of land were allotted for holding the fairs at Tideswell, under the inclosure act of 1807/ The manor of Tideswell was in the crown when the Survey of Domesday was taken : it afterwards belonged to the Peverells. King John granted it, in 1205, to Thomas Armiger and his heirs/ It is probable, that it passed by female descent to the Bamptons, who had the grant of a market in 1250, the Daniells, to whom the manor was confirmed by King Edward I. in 1 304 ', are stated to have been representatives of Thomas Armiger m above mentioned. In 1330 it was vested in the coheiresses of Daniell; in 1337, Elizabeth Meverell, one of the coheiresses, died seised of a third of it : the other coheiresses married Marchinton and Turvill/ It is probable that Richard Stafford, to whom the market was confirmed in 1392, was de scended from one of these. The whole appears to have centered by gift or purchase in the Meverells. The heiress of Meverell brought this manor to the Cromwell family. In 1654, Winfield Lord Cromwell sold it to Robert Eyre, Esq., of Highlow. William Eyre, his grandson, took the name of Archer, and was father of John Archer, Esq., who died in 1800.

It is said, that in consequence of a shower of rain, they adjourned to a public-house on the moor, called the Cock and Pynot (or Magpie), which acquired from this circumstance the name of the Revolution-house ; and the small room where these distin guished guests retired, that of the Plotting-Parlour. The arm-chair in which the Duke of Devonshire sat still forms part of the furniture of this room. When the centenary of the revolution was observed in Derbyshire with much celebrity in 1788, the committee dined on the preceding day at the Revolution-house. On the anniversary, the venerable Dr. Pegge preached on the occasion at Whittington church, before the descendants of the illustrious revolutionists above-mentioned, and a large assemblage of persons of the first families in the county and neighbourhood, who were met together for the purpose of commemorating this great event. After divine service, they went in procession to partake of a cold collation at the Revolution-house, whence they proceeded to Chesterfield to dinner. A subscription was opened for the purpose of erecting a column on Whitting ton-moor, in memory of the Revolution ; but in consequence of the turbu lent scenes in which all Europe was soon afterwards involved, it was de ferred, and the intention has not yet been carried into effect. There is a chalybeate spring at Whittington, which was formerly much resorted to. A cold bath was inclosed in 1769.

The Abneys resided at Willesley for many generations, and became eventually possessed of the manor which had belonged to Burton-Abbey, and which, after the Reformation, had been granted to the Sheffield family. Willesley is now the property and seat of General Sir Charles Hastings, Bart., who married the daughter and heir of the late Thomas Abney, Esq., and grand-daughter of Sir Thomas Abney, one of the Justices of the Common-Pleas. Sir Thomas Abney of Stoke-Newington in Middlesex, some time Lord-Mayor of London, and one of the first founders of the Bank of England, was of this family, and born at Willesley in 1639. The manor-house, which is in the form of the letter H, appears to have been built in or about the time of Charles I.

Willington, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch and in the deanery of Derby, lies about seven miles from Derby, on the banks of the Trent, opposite to Repton. The manor, at the time of taking the Domes day Survey, belonged partly to the King and partly to Ralph Fitz-Hubert. King Henry II., gave a manor in Willington to Burton-Abbey ; George Finderne, Esq., held this manor under Burton- Abbey in 1539; John Meynell, Esq., died seised of it in 1561 ; it was purchased of Hugo Meynell, Esq., in the year 1760, by the father of Sir Henry Crewe, Bart., who is the present proprietor. There are no remains of the manor-house, which was a seat of the Meynells.

About the same time, the Duke sold the remaining sixth to Mr. Immanuel Halton. The Earl of Arundel's share was sold by the Duke of Norfolk, in 1678, to Immanuel Halton and others. This third part and one-sixth of the other third before-mentioned, are now the property of his descendant, Winfield Halton, Esq.'

In 1 774, in consequence of a partition of the estate, the whole of the manor-house became the property of Immanuel Halton, Esq., who pulled down a consi derable part of this beautiful and interesting Gothic mansion, and made use of the materials in building the house, which is now the residence of his son, Winfield Halton, Esq., at the bottom of the hill. A description of the present state of the ruins of Winfield manor-house has been already given. There were formerly two parks belonging to Winfield manor, the larger of which, extending into the parish of Pentridge, contained nearly 1000 acres. In the parish church are some monuments of the Halton family.\" Mr. Immanuel Halton, who died in 1699, was the first of the family who settled in Derbyshire ; he was born at Greenthwaite, in the parish of Greystock in Cumberland, and educated at the grammar-school at Blencowe ; he was afterwards a student at Grays-Inn, \" whence he was called to the service of Henry Duke of Norfolk ; the last years of his life were spent in the studies of music and mathematics, in which noble sciences he attained a great perfection.\" Some of his mathematical treatises are printed in the Appendix to Foster's mathematical Miscellanies ; and an Account of the Eclipse of the Sun observed at Winfield, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1676. The church of South-Winfield was given to the monks of Darley by Ralph Fitz-Stephen, Chamberlain to King Henry II.0 and became appro priated to that convent. The Duke of Devonshire is the present impropriator and patron of the vicarage. The sum of 200I. given by Mr. John Newton, in 1683, for charitable uses, having been laid out in the purchase of lands, now let at 30I. 5s. per annum, twenty pounds per annum, part of the rent, is now given to a school master for instructing twenty-six children. m Sir John Gell's Narrative, MS. \" Immanuel Halton, who died in 1699, married Mary, daughter of Mr. John Newton of Oakerthorpe; Immanuel Halton, Esq., 17.84; Miles Halton, M.A. 1792. \u2022 Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. iii. p. 58.

The manor of Ufton belonged to the Heriz family, and afterwards to the Earls of Shrewsbury. It was part of the purchase of Mr. Immanuel Halton, and is now the property of his descendant, Winfield Halton, Esq. The site of the manor of Ufton was near the Peacock-Inn, on the road from Chester field to Derby, adjoining to which stood the chapel of Limbury. There were some remains of this chapel in 1761. John de Heriz had a licence from the abbot of Derley to have divine service performed in the chapel of Limbury.

The chief, or paramount manor, belonged in the year 835 to the abbey of Repton.s It is probable that in consequence of the destruction of that monastery by the Danes, it became vested in the crown, to which it belonged at the time of taking the Domesday Survey. King John, in the fifth year of his reign, granted this manor to William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby. Having been forfeited by the attainder of Robert, Earl of Derby, in 1265, it was granted, together with the wapentake, by Edward I. to his brother Edmund, Earl of Lancaster. It has ever since formed part of the earldom or duchy of Lancaster. It is now held under the duchy, by Ri chard Arkwright, Esq., to whom it was granted on the expiration of a lease held by the Jodrell family. Courts-barons are held twice a year at Wirksworth, for this manor : courts-leet for the wapentake, and barmote-courts for the better conducting of the mines and mineral concerns within the wapentake, are held also at Wirksworth. The manor of Holland, otherwise Richmonds, was given by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster to Sir Robert Holland. It continued in different branches of the Holland family, till it was forfeited by the attainder of Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, in 1461.

In the year 1574, Mrs. Agnes Feme gave five marks per annum to a free school, when such should be founded, and 40s. per annum to an alms-house when founded. It is probable that she knew of the intentions of Anthony Gell, Esq., who in 1576 founded a grammar-school, and endowed it with lands, now let at about 170I. per annum, and an alms-house for six poor aged men, to which he gave a rent-charge of 20I. on the manor of Hollands. Mr. Henry Gee, in 161 9, gave 5I. per annum to the school, and 5I. per annum to the alms-house. Mr. Anthony Bunting, in 1685, gave 5I. per annum to the alms-house. The manor of Callow or Caldlow, (which township forms a joint con stablery with Ible) was an appendage to the King's manor of Wirksworth. It was held at a very early period by the family of Okeover. In the reign of Edward I. it belonged to the De la Laundes ; from whom it passed suc cessively to the Stathams of Morley, and the Sacheverells. Henry Sache verell, Esq., who died in 1620, gave it to his natural son, Valens Sacheverell, whose son George gave a moiety of it to his great nephew, George Sache verell Chadwick : this moiety is now the property of George Chadwick, Esq. The other moiety was given by George Sacheverell, Esq., to the ce lebrated Dr. Henry Sacheverell0, rector of St. Andrew's, Holborn. The Doctor's widow gave it to her third husband, Charles Chambers.

In 1775 these parties joined in selling the moiety of the manor of Callow to Philip Gell, Esq., father of Philip Gell, Esq., M.P., the present proprietor. '1 he duchy manor exercises a paramount jurisdiction over the manor of Callow. In consequence of a partition of the estate, Callow-hall and demesne are the property of Mr. Chadwick. In or about the reign of Edward I., certain lands in Ibole or Ible de scribed as a third part of the lordship, were sold by Henry de Barton to Ralph de Snitterton, from whom this estate passed to the Sacheverells. Thomas Sacheverell sold it, in or about the year 1498, to Sir Henry Ver non. In or about the year 1565, Sir George Vernon sold the manor of Ible to Henry Mather, whose grandson conveyed it to Anthony Hopkinson. John Hopkinson, Esq., of Bonsall, sold it in 1689 to the Reverend William Osborne; by him it was, in 1696, conveyed to William Buckley, yeoman, whose grandson sold it in parcels. The duchy manor of Wirksworth has a paramount jurisdiction over this lordship. The township of Hopton adjoins the village of Carsington about a mile and a half from Wirksworth. A family who were called De Hopton, from the place of their abode, had the chief landed property in Hopton as early as the reign of King John. William de Hopton, who lived in the reign of Edward II., left a daughter and heir married to Nicholas de Rollesley. The heiress of Rollesley brought this estate in the reign of Queen Eliza beth to Sir William Kniveton ; from whom it passed successively to the families of Greatrakes, Feme, and Stuffin. Johanna, daughter and heir of another branch of the family, is said to have brought all her estates in Hopton and Carsington to Ralph Gell, whose ancestors had then resided for some generations at Hopton. A descendant of the same name died seised of the manor of Hopton in 1564. Sir John Gell, who had been created a Baronet in 1642, was from the very commencement of the civil war a most zealous officer on the side of the Parliament.\" He took Lich field, and rendered very important services to his party in his native county and elsewhere, for which he several times received the thanks of the d Mrs. Hutchinson, who allows that Sir John Gell \" very early put himself into the service of Parliament,\" accuses him of having been, before the commencement of the war, one of the most zealous abettors of the King's arbitrary measures ; and says, that when sheriff of Derby shire, he had exacted most rigorously the obnoxious tax of ship-money, particularly against Sir John Stanhope. This lady makes pretty free with his character, and attributes his early and active zeal for the Parliament to his fear of being called in question for his arbitrary pro ceedings.

It appears that after the termination of the war, he was much dis* satisfied with the treatment he received from the Parliament. In the possession of his descendant, Philip Gell, Esq., M.P., at Hopton-hall, are two narratives of the principal transactions in which he had been engaged, and the services he had rendered to the Parliament, drawn up as it appears by way of memorials', to confute certain calumnies of which he complains. He states, that he was the first in that county, who declared for the Par liament ; that he had received from them only 64I., and that he had ex pended above 5000I. of his own property, besides the loss he sustained when his house was plundered by the enemy. Among Sir John Gell's papers is an order of the Earl of Leven, dated April 21,1 646, enjoining the Scottish forces not to plunder Hopton, or any \"of Sir John Gell's houses or lands. There is a bill, also, for the the cure of a severe wound in his neck, from which some items are given in the note as a specimen of the practice and charges of that time/ The first charge is on the 7th of July, 1646 ; the cure appears to have been completed before August 22.

The doublet weighs 1 1 pounds. In 1650 Sir John Gell incurred the displeasure of the then ruling powers, and was sentenced by the High Court of Justice to be imprisoned for life, and his estates to be confiscated s ; but two years afterwards he procured his pardon. Sir Philip Gell, the third Baronet, purchased, of the Stuffins, the estate at Hopton, which had belonged to the other branch of the Hoptons. Upon his death, in 1719, the title became extinct, and Hopton, with other estates, passed under his will to John Eyre, a younger son of his sister Catherine*, who, in pursuance of his uncle's directions, took the name of Gell, and was grandfather of Philip Gell, Esq., M.P., of Hopton-hall, the present lord of the manor. Sir Philip Gell above-mentioned founded an alms-house at Hopton for two poor people of Hopton and two of Carsington. It was completed and inhabited in 1722. Certain lands are charged with the payment of 2s. a week to each pensioner. The manor of Ivenbrook (a small village about four miles north from Wirksworth) was given by Henry Studley, who died about the year 1165, to the abbey of Bildewas, in Shropshire. It was granted by King Henry VIIL to Edward Grey, Lord Powis ; from whom it has passed by inherit ance, through the Ludlows and Vernons of Stokesley, to the Right Honour able Lord Scarsdale, who is the present proprietor.

From Mary, Lady Armyne, his daughter and coheir, it passed to Evelyn, Duke of Kingston, descended from her sister Gertrude. The Duke sold it, in 17 16, to William Soresby, Gent. William Soresby, the grandson, dying unmarried, his two sisters became his coheirs : Mary married William Milnes, Esq., and Helen the Reverend Thomas Munro. Mr. Milnes purchased Munro's moiety, and in 1776 sold the whole to Peter Nightingale, Esq., of Lea, of whom it was purchased in 1789, by Sir Richard Arkwright, father of Richard Ark wright, Esq., M. P., the present proprietor. Cromford became very populous in consequence of the cotton-works es tablished by the late Sir Richard Arkwright at this place, and in the adjoin ing parish of Matlock. The first cotton-mill was erected in 1771 ; the second, or lower mill, a few years afterwards ; and the large mill, called Masson-mill, between Cromford and Matlock-bath, in 1783. Soon after Sir Richard Arkwright purchased the manor of Cromford he began to build a chapel on a piece of ground called the Green, which was finished by Mr. Arkwright after his father's death. This chapel was con secrated in 1797, and endowed by Mr. Arkwright with 50I. per annum. It has since, by Mr. Arkwright's further benefaction, been augmented with Queen Anne's Bounty. The patronage is vested in Mr. Arkwright and his heirs. There had been an ancient chapel at this place, many years ago demolished. Between Cromford and Wirksworth is an alms-house for six poor widows, founded by Dame Mary Armyne, lady of the manor of Cromford, in 1651. The pensioners have 40s. per annum each, and a gown. The Wigley family had for several generations a considerable estate at Middleton : the manor belongs to Philip Gell, Esq., of Hopton. A branch of the Gell family was some time settled here. Wigwell-grange was given in the reign of Henry III., by William le Foune and others, and confirmed by^William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, to the abbot and convent of Derley ; and it is said to have been the fa vourite summer residence of the abbots of that house.

Alderwasley, commonly called Arrowsley, lies about two miles south-east from Wirksworth. The manor anciently belonged to the Ferrars family, and was afterwards annexed to the earldom and duchy of Lancaster. The family of Le Foune, or Fawne, had an estate here as early as the reign of Henry III. Thomas Fawne, their descendant, the last of the male line, left a daughter and heir, married to Thomas Lowe, father of Anthony Lowe, who procured from King Henry VIIL, in 1528, a grant of the manor, which had belonged to the duchy. Elizabeth, the sister and heir of his descendant and namesake, who died in 1690, brought this manor and estate to Nicholas Hurt, of Castern in Staffordshire, great-great-grandfather of Francis Hurt, Esq., of Alderwasley-hall, the present proprietor. In the civil war (1643) this manor was sequestered as the property of Edward Lowe, a royalist, and in 1646 leased to Richard Chadwick. It appears by one of the grants to the family of Le Foune, that the Earls of Lancaster had a hunting-seat near Alderwasley. The chapel at Alderwasley was built in the reign of Henry VIIL, by the joint contributions of Thomas Lowe and other principal inhabitants. It is not subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, has no parochial duties performed in it, and has no endowment. The minister is paid an optional salary by Mr. Hurt, who has the sole appointment. Alderwasley forms a joint con stablery with Ashley-hay and Miln-hay. The townships of Alton and Biggin form a joint constablery. Alton is situated about two miles south from Wirksv orth. William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, conveyed the manor of Altor, in the reign of Henry III., to Richard Burun, or Byron, whose descendant, Sir Nicholas Byron, died seised of it in 1503. It was afterwards successively in the Blackwalls' and Iretons. Henry Mellor purchased it of the latter about the middle of the seventeenth century : his brother and heir sold it to the Honourable An chetil Grey.

His grand-daughters and coheirs married Cresswell and Cock. Henry Jackson, in 1752, left the sum of 15I. for the purpose of teaching two children of the township of Iderich-hay.

The town ship of Youlgrave is partly in the hundred of the High-Peak and partly in the wapentake of Wirksworth. Youlgrave (Giolgrave) was one of the manors belonging to Henry de Ferrars, when the Survey of Domesday was taken. In the reign of Edw.

An act of parliament for inclosing Youlgrave and Middleton passed in 1 8 15. The Duke of Devonshire is stated in the act to be impropriator of corn, &c. in Youlgrave and Middleton ; the Duke of Rutland of wool and lambs in Middleton. The following remarkable entries relating to the seasons of 161 5, are copied from the parish register. \" A memoriall of the great snow.\" \"This year, 1 614-5, Jan: '6> began the greatest snow which ever fell uppon the earth, within man's memorye. It cover'd the earth fyve quarters deep uppon the playne. And for heapes or drifts of snow, they were very deep, so that passengers, both horse and foot, passed over yates, hedges, and walles. It fell at ten severall tymes, and the last was the greatest, to the greate admiration and feare of all the land, for it came from the foure p\" of the world, so that all c'ntryes were full, yea, the south p\"te as well as these mountaynes. It continued by daily encreasing untill the 12th day of March, (without the sight of any earth, eyther uppon hilles or val leyes) uppon wch daye, being the Lordes day, it began to decrease j and so by little and little consumed and wasted away, till the eight and twentyth day of May for then all the heapes or drifts of snow were consumed, except one uppon Kinder-Scout, wch lay till Witson week. \" Hyndrances and losses in this peake entry by the snowe abovesayd. 1. It hindered the seed tyme. 2. It consumed much fodder. 3. And many wanted fewell, otherwise few were smoothered in the fall or drowned in the passage ; in regard the floods of water were not great though many.\" \" The name of our Lord be praysed.\" 0 Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. ii. p. 315. t Rot.

Uppon May day, in the morning, instead of fetching in flowers, the youthes brought in flakes of snow, wch lay above a foot deep uppon the moores and mountaynes.\" This extraordinary snow is thus mentioned by Stowe in his Chronicle. The dates somewhat vary. \" The 17th of Januarie, 1614-5, began a great frost with extreame snow, which continued until the 14 of February ; and albeit, the violence of the frost and snow some dayes abated, yet it continued freezing and snowing much or little, untill the 7 of March, whereby much cattel perished, as well old as young : and in some places, divers devised snow-ploughes to cleare the ground, and to fodder cattell j this snow was very dangerous to all travailers.\" 1615. \" A dry summer.\" \" There was no rayne fell uppon the earth from the 25th day of March till the 2d day of May, and then there was but one shower ; after which there fell none tyll the 1 8ttt day of June, and then there fell an other ; after yf there fell none at all till the 4th day of August, after which tyme there was sufficient rayne uppon the earth ; so that the greatest pc of this land, especially the south pts were burnt upp both corne and hay. An ordi nary sumer load of hay was at 2L, and little or none to be gott for money. \" This pf of the peake was very sore burnt upp, onely Lankishyre and Cheshyre had rayne ynough all sumer ; and both corne and hay sufficient. \" There was very little rayne fell the last winter but snowe onely.\" There is a chapel at Youlgrave for the Wesleyan Methodists. A school is supported here by voluntary subscriptions ; the schoolhouse was built in 1765. A small benefaction for the purchase of books was given by Mrs. Ellen Webster. The manor of Middleton belonged to the Herthills, and passed with their heiress to the Cokaines. About the close of the sixteenth century, it was sold by the latter to the Fulwoods, who possessed it for a considerable time. In 17 19 it belonged to Sir John Curzon and Elizabeth Bateman. Sir John Curzon's part passed successively to Sanders and Howe. In 1771 this manor was the joint property of Lord Viscount Howe and Matthew Roper, Esq. It now belongs to Thomas Bateman, Esq., by purchase from the coheiresses of Viscount Howe. Smerrill-grange passed with the manor of Herthill, in Bakewell, from the Herthills to the Cokaines, and from the latter, by sale to the ancestor of the Duke of Devonshire, who is the present proprietor. 12 The"], [657, "DERBYSHIRE. 305 The parochial chapelry of Elton lies about two miles and a half from Youlgrave, and one and a quarter from Winster. The manor, from the reign of Edward III. to that of Queen Elizabeth, belonged to the Foljambes. In the former reign it was held under the Tibetots, who had succeeded the Bar dolfs as Lords paramount, by the render of a pair of gilt spurs.\" It is now in moieties between Bache Thornhill, Esq., and Hylton Joliffe, Esq. The latter derives his title from a coheiress of the Stevensons by marriage/ Mr. Thornhill's moiety was purchased of the other coheiress. The minister of Elton chapel is appointed by the majority of householders in the chapelry : the curacy has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. An act of parliament for inclosing lands in the townships of Elton and Winster, was passed in 1809, when allotments were made in lieu of tithes. Two bovates of land in Gratton were given, in the year 1358, to the warden of the altar of St. Margaret at Elton, by Godfrey Meynell and William de Saperton.s The manor of Gratton belonged to the Middletons in the reign of Henry VIIL, and they continued to possess it in 1675 : about that time it passed by marriage to the Lowes. In 1723, it was purchased by John, grandfather of Bache Thornhill, Esq., who is the present proprietor. Mr. Thornhill possesses also the manors of Stanton and Birchover. Stanton belonged to the Foljambes, and passed, by marriage, to the Plumptons. Sir William Plumpton died seised of it in 1480. It was the joint property of the Duke of Rutland and Mr. Thornhill till the year 1809, when, in consequence of an exchange made under the Inclosure Act, the whole became vested in Mr. Thornhill. Stanton-hall, the seat of Bache Thornhill, Esq., was for two centuries or more the residence of his ancestors, the Baches. Mr. Thornhill rebuilt the hall in 1799, and has lately made a deer-park, and ex tensive plantations. Thomas Allen, yeoman, who died in 1574, was seised of a moiety of the manor of Stanton-hall, and the manor of Stanton-Ley. This estate now belongs to the Duke of Rutland, who has fitted up an old mansion on it, called Stanton-Woodhouse, (formerly the residence of the Aliens) as a place of occasional resort during the shooting season. Lands in the township of Stanton have been inclosed by an act of parlia- ' Esch. 1 1 Edw. I.

The Marchioness of Sligo was entitled to certain modus's for tithes of hay. The chapel at Rowtor in the hamlet of Birchover, was built by Thomas Eyre, Esq., of Rowtor, who died in 17 17, and endowed with 20I. per annum, for the performance of divine service on the first Sunday in every month. The service is now generally performed every Sunday. The minister of this chapel is appointed by the possessor of the estate at Rowtor, for merly belonging to the Eyres. It is exempt from ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and is repaired by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants of Birch over, that hamlet being about two miles distant from the parish church. Conksbury and Meadow-Pleck, or Meadow-Place, lying to the north of Youlgrave, near Over-Haddon, in Bakewell, belonged to the abbey of Lei cester. Conksbury was given to that monastery (and probably the grant included Meadow-Place) by William Avenell/ King Edward VI., in 1552, granted the manor of Meadow-Pleck to Sir William Cavendish\", from whom it has descended to his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. Winster is a small market-town, about three miles from Youlgrave, about 19 miles from Derby, and about 145 from London. The market, which appears to have been held by prescription, (as we can find no grant for it on record,) is held on Saturdays, chiefly for butchers'-meat. There is no fair now held. Winster (Winsterne) was one of the manors belonging to Henry de Fer rars, when the Survey of Domesday was taken. It was, at a later period, in the Mountjoys, who were succeeded by the Meynells. The latter sold it to the freeholders in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Mrs. Ann Phenney and Mr. Henry Fenshaw, in 1702, gave one-fourth of the tithes of corn and hay in this township to the minister of the chapel, who is appointed by the resident freeholders. The chapel was augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty, in the early part of the last century ; the inha bitants having subscribed 200I. for that purpose : the lands were purchased in the year 1728. There is a chapel at Winster for the Wesleyan Methodists. Thomas Eyre, Esq., of Rowtor, in 1717, gave 20I. per annum to the minister of Winster, on condition of his teaching 20 children to read the Bible. Mr. Moore, of Winster, in 1718, gave 5L per annum for the purpose of teaching poor children. 1 Dugdale's Monasticon, vol.ii. p. 3 14. \" Rot. Pat. 6 Edw. VI."], [659, "307 ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.

P. vi. To the eminent natives of Derbyshire, whose birth-place cannot be ascertained, may be added, Woodward the celebrated mineralogist, born in 1665. On the 9th of June, 18 17, an alarming insurrection broke out at South- Winfield, in this county. The insurgents, who were chiefly inhabitants of South- Winfield and some neighbouring villages, proceeded towards Nottingham, in pursuit of their rash enterprise ; the object of which was the overthrow of the constitution. They were met by a party of the mili tary within a few miles of the above-mentioned town, and speedily dis persed. Many of the insurgents taken on this occasion were committed to the prisons of Nottingham and Derby, and tried by a special commission at Derby, in the month of October following ; when three out of four of the ringleaders, who had been tried and convicted of high-treason, were executed at Derby, on the 7th of November. Nineteen others, who had pleaded 720/ guilty, withdrew that plea, and having pleaded guilty, by the advice of their counsel, were reprieved : and twelve were acquitted, no evidence having been offered against them.
