The following Catalogue originated in the compilation of a List of Books relating to Devonshire in a private Library ; but it has been thought worthy of extension and of publication for the use of those who take an interest in the Topography, History, or Biography of the County, and as an accessory to the labours of future Historians. An attempt has not been made to include works of general interest, though containing incidental or particular reference to Devonshire. Many of these, it is certain, comprise original matter of considerable value, but the list of such books would itself alone have extended to a volume perhaps as large as the present. This may be concluded by only adverting to the several Histories, Encyclop\u00e6dias, Gazetteers, Dic tionaries, and Peerages \u2014 the Archaeologia \u2014 the Vetusta Monumenta \u2014 the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society \u2014 the Gentleman's Magazine, and many other periodical works \u2014 the various books of Tours and Travels, Letters and Journals \u2014 the Reports of the Geologi cal, Medical, and many other learned and scientific bodies \u2014 Law Re ports \u2014 Parliamentary Papers, and Blue Books. A short List will be found of temporary Periodical Works published in the County, which ought not to be forgotten, as, amongst a variety of ephemeral matter, they contain many scraps of local and biographical interest."], [10, "I.

One or more of the numerous copies of Eisdon's Work in MS. having fallen into the hands of the once notorious Bookseller and Auctioneer, E. Curll, the first edition in 1714 was about to be issued by him, but was so defective and erroneous that he found it needful to publish the Continuation also, which is by far the best part of the work. The whole, though professedly collated with several MSS. is extremely incorrect, much distorted, and in some parts almost unintelligible. Owing to the trickery of the first and other publishers, it is scarcely possible to give a statement which may be relied on of the various issues of the Wrork since that period. It is even doubtful whether all the subsequent editions, so called, are not the original one un der different forms and dates, with new Title-pages. The Work sometimes appears in two volumes.\u2014 The account of the Spieer Family is va riously placed, at the beginning, the middle, and the end, and is sometimes omitted. Some copies have the Exeter Conduit as a Frontispiece.

The following list ot works relating to the County of Devon during a stormy period of our history, is the result of long and diligent search through many libraries. The investiga tion of the catalogues alone of the more than 40,000 tracts relating to this era in the Bri tish Museum is, itself, an arduous task, and after all is not entirely satisfactory. In nianv instances the titles of books, in accordance with the periphrastical taste of the times, are very wide of the information contained in them, and a few leaves often embrace scraps of intelligence from several quarters of the Kingdom ; so that the historian who is in search of minute points of record, must not be content to run over a catalogue, but must be prepared to toil through a vast extent of dusty lore. The papers regular and occasional, with news reel or conjectural, which appeared during thc civil war, and afterwards, till the waters of strife had subsided, were almost innumerable. Many of them are thoroughly disgusting. not only by the violent spirit of partisanship, but by the grossness of their language \u2014 \" In countless myriads swarming from the press Like Egypt's insects from the mud of Nile.\" Specimens of more than seventy periodical news-letters have been found, of which some ran a course of a few years, while others perished on coming into the light of day. About forty of them bear the title of a \" Mercury\" of one quality or other, enough to record the wisdom, wit, and wickedness, not only of the Herald of Olympus, but of all the family. Tor instance, we have Mereurius Aulicus, M. Belgicus, M. Civicus, M. Rusticus, M. Clericus, MT Poeticus, Jl. Militaris, M. Melancholicus, M.

Collec tions of such as these lie hid in great numbers among the treasures of learning and literature in the libraries of many of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, but in some instances they are all but inaccessible ; not only in consequence of the ancient restrictions on the time and manner of consulting the libraries, but because the tracts are not separately entered iu catalogues, and have no kind of reference to them.
