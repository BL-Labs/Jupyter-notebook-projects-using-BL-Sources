The house-party at Ladysnieade had nominally assembled on the previous day, Monday, although some intimates and near relatives had arrived on the Friday ; and Lady Hope, who was an ideal hostess, inasmuch as she knew her world and all its various cliques, had advisedly chosen her guests, with the result that they were immediately at home together, having the same watchwords and the same shibboleth, which are understood by the initiate smart few only. VOL. I. 1"], [12, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 2 Lady Marcia Legh was the latest arrival. She had come early in the afternoon ; but, tired after a four hours' journey, she had repaired at once to her room, and made her first appearance in public, clean and fresh-looking as any girl, in a wonderful Watteau gown, with youthful bunches of pink tipped daisies on yellow brocade, and an aigrette of yellow rosebuds nodding in her little lace cap, as she twisted her head this way and that to take in all the component parts of her surroundings, and to pick up the threads of the animated con versation of a small circle gathered round the fire. Lady Marcia Legh was a distinguished old maid, who had aged by such imperceptible degrees that she had never for a moment fallen out from the gay but selfish ranks which are almost brutal in their dread of ennui or want of smartness. Com paratively early in life she had left the parental"], [13, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 3 roof, and, having established a safe reputation for eccentricity, had set up a bijou establishment in Upper Brook Street, where all the celebrities of each succeeding day were well content to be her guests. The comfortable income which had come to her at the death of her parents (a respectable peer and peeress, who during their lives had looked on half amused and half aghast at their daughter's brilliant social flights) was well laid out, and though no sacrifices were made to appearance or vulgar ostentation, Lady Marcia lacked nothing that could contribute to her comfort. True, she gave no big dinners or formal entertainments, excusing herself on the deceptive plea that no one cared to turn out at night to come and see an old maid ; but her little Sunday luncheon-parties, which generally included the latest literary star, or some dramatic beauty, and which were often"], [14, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 4 honoured by the presence of a Personage, were held in high esteem. She herself was of social value, not only as the possessor of money to which there was no appointed heir, but as a charming woman of bright wit and highly cultivated mind. 'Wherever she went she met the warmest welcome, and on the present occasion she was a person of especial importance. The party at Ladysmeade was given in honour of her nephew, who, it was understood, might also be her heir, if for no better reason than that he was already overburdened with wealth. If any thing more had been needed to make him sought by Society, he had lately married the only daughter of Lord Canbourne, a Scotch marquis, who had had a career abroad, his straitened means having pre vented him from holding his own upon his native heath, or in the English centre of civilization."], [15, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 5 Lady Violet Bourne was just nineteen when chance threw her in the way of Kenneth Johnson. He was a young man with an impossible father, whose only virtue in the eyes of the world outside Liverpool (his birthplace) was his colossal fortune. His mother, whose identity as the twin sister of Lady Marcia Legh had been of inestimable service to her son, had died very soon after her marriage, under the burden of an honour to which her simple minded but hopelessly vulgar ' Lord Burleigh ' was not born. The marriage of Kenneth Johnson with Lady Violet Bourne had been a very quiet one ; but the light of a coming social star cannot easily be hidden, and the bride's beauty had been para graphed in every paper, so that curiosity was rife among her near relations. It was her husband's cousin, Lady Hope, who, before the honeymoon"], [16, "6 VASHTI AND ESTHER had waned, invited the young couple to her house, and, having secured their presence, had bidden the more important members of the family and several very smart outsiders to meet them. The Marchioness of Cheshire, who was a cousin of Lord Canbourne, and well known in the racing world, had given up a small autumn meeting to be there, and was accompanied by her young husband, Captain Philip Graham. Mrs. Guy Turton, who was a more distant connection, had also shown her appreciation of the compliment paid her by bring ing her husband. Mrs. Turton had been a fashion able beauty for the last decade, and would continue to be admired and tolerated (in spite of sundry episodes in her career which even her own set, tolerant to a fault, had stigmatized as ' too bad ') so long as she did nothing quite outrageous, and so long as"], [17, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 7 she remained in favour with the Personage who had first brought her into special notice. Horace Vane, who was social by profession and an authority on smartness, had also considered it his duty to be present, although very few country houses had sufficiently potent attractions to tempt him away from his beloved London. ' Who else is here ?' asked Lady Marcia, who comfortably occupied the easiest of easy-chairs, as the centre of the little group. Lady Hope, as hostess, naturally took up the in quiry. She was a pretty, graceful woman, with fair hair just a shade too golden intone, and a complexion that was just a little bit too pink and white. At night, however, her colouring looked natural enough, and even by daytime was not so patently unreal as to be condemned, though, by a turn of that won derful wheel called fashion, ' making up ' (if of too"], [18, "8 VASHTI AND ESTHER unmistakable a nature) is once more considered bad style. ' It would be almost easier to say who is not here,' she answered with an air of languid delight in her own strategic hospitalities. ' Lady Greye declined ; she seemed to think that the inducement of meeting a rival beauty and no Royalties was insufficient. John Lessington has given us his usual \" two days,\" neither more nor less; his mental equi librium is perfect. Susan Lady Maybury is here, and \" the Duchess \" has refused I don't know how many invitations to accept mine.'

Not you, I am sure ; and if anyone is younger than you, Aunt Marcia, at '"], [19, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 9 ' I don't profess to be so young as \"the Duchess,\" ' was interpolated tartly. Lady Hope executed a clever yawn behind her jewelled fingers, and incontinently abandoned a dis cussion which, it struck her suddenly, was rather a dangerous one, with Lady Marcia looking daggers at her on the one side, while on the other was Lady Cheshire, a ' jolly J woman who carried her years like a man, but was well over sixty, and had married three times \u2014 first for rank, secondly for riches, and thirdly because she wanted to see how she should like a young and handsome husband. ' What is Lady Violet like ?' asked Lady Marcia, who also deemed it better to break fresh ground in conversation. 'A big, good-looking girl, with better features than expression,' began Lady Hope in rather grudging commendation ; but her young unmarried"], [20, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 10 sister, Lettice Legh, who had come in quietly and nestled herself on to a footstool at Lady Marcia's feet, took up the parable with enthusiastic spirit. ' She is divine ! Imagine, Aunt Marcia, a woman standing nearly five foot ten, but so grandly pro portioned that she does not look even a little bit too tall. She moves like a goddess. There is condescension in her smile \u2014 a kindly graciousness in what in anybody else would be no more than ordinary politeness. You might think she was haughty ' ' All the Bournes are notoriously proud ; it struck me that Lady Violet had her share of the family failing,' remarked Mrs. Guy Turton dryly. ' \"When she looks at you with her big blue eyes"], [21, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 11 ' They are green,' said Lady Hope. 'Gray, with different coloured lights,' said Mrs. Turton, with the air of one who could be, if not generous, at least quite just. ' When she looks at you,' persisted Lettice im patiently, ' you forget to wonder whether they are green, or blue, or gray. Her whole soul is in them. A man might worship her \u2014 might die for her!' ' Not Kenneth,' said Kenneth's aunt with a queer smile. ' She certainly knows how to dress,' reflected Lady Hope, ' though how she learnt her lesson on something like a hundred a year is more than I can say. The first night she arrived she wore gray velvet with magnificent black pearls.' ' So unlucky for a bride !' lamented Lettice ' And last night, when some of the county folks"], [22, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 12 were dining, she was all in white, but stiff with diamonds. You should have seen the people stare ! Lady Meresford, who lodges all her jewels at the bank, and only favours us with one girlish row of pearls and a few diamond stars plastered down on her smooth hair, gaped open-mouthed at such an opulent display. It made me feel rather shabby. Certainly Kenneth has been very gen erously inclined.' ' Kenneth never withholds his hand when an outlay will add to his own glory,' remarked Lady Marcia, who had no very high opinion of her probable heir. ' But,' broke in Lettice breathlessly, ' to-night she will surpass herself in splendour. I happened to go into her room and saw her maid sewing heavy epaulettes and a stomacher of emeralds and diamonds on to a bright green velvet gown. She"], [23, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 13 showed me the tiara and necklace to match. They were simply gorgeous.' ' They tell me that new bright green is becoming,' mused the Marchioness of Cheshire. ' To a good complexion,' said Mrs. Turton, with a warning accent of which the other woman made note for future retaliation. Their hostess quickly intervened. ' Lady Violet, after a long and painful experience of poverty, naturally appreciates the change to riches. Presently she will grow acclimatized to wealth, and will cease to treat us to such grand effects.' ' Sybil, how can you ! She might have been born a queen.' ' A queen without crown jewels is very like an ordinary woman.' ' W^omen are apt to resemble each other ; but I"], [24, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 14 think, Lady Hope, that Kenneth Johnson's lovely wife may be quoted as an exception to a harmless rule.' ' She is fortunate, Mr. Vane, in having your approval. I know of no surer road to success.' ' You give me credit for some power.' ' Not more than you possess.' She looked him straight in the eyes, and he returned her gaze with the unvarying smile that had brought him safely through many awkward situations. It was generally suspected that Horace Vane contributed Society Notes, not only to a big daily paper, but to some minor journals, which were generally read, but always abused, by the people whom they most concerned ; he had, however, never owned to an impeachment, and the offence had not been satisfactorily proved against him."], [25, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 15 Between Lady Hope and himself was an old feud which had once raged furiously, but now smouldered, as the lady had discovered that an outbreak of enmity on her part was sure to be followed by some depreciatory paragraphs in print. ' I am a natural product of the times, a disagreeable necessity \u2014 and one must live, dear boy,' the gentleman-journalist had said to himself in self-exculpation, and then he had balanced his account with society by insert ing sundry good-natured and even over-generous remarks about his more complacent friends. Mr. Vane had a charming manner and a soft voice. His power of pleasing (by the simplest methods) was cultivated to a fine art, and he never expected to be pleased. It was sufficient that his world \u2014 he lived in no limited circle \u2014 should show him little cheap attentions, or, at least, throw no difficulties in his way. So long as he could make"], [26, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 16 an easy thousand a year by recording the move ments of society and criticising their dohigs and their looks, he was content to let them down easily, and even to overlook an occasional snub. It is true he sometimes helped a struggling aspirant to fame, and made a beauty's reputation, for his influence pervaded the London press to an almost incredible extent, and he was not malicious, only selfish. He met Lady Hope's challenge with imper turbable good - humour, more effective than any bluster ; but he evaded a direct reply. ' Wre all have our uses. I belong to a great and a glorious club ' ' Oh, we know what the \"Golden Y'outh \" has done, and can still do,' said Mrs. Turton. ' I remember the first ball after my presentation on my marriage, and how I felt when a contingent, headed by you, came into the room. Would they dance with me ?"], [27, "IN A COUNTRY HOUSE 17 would they even notice my existence ? \u2014 those were the questions on which my social fate depended.' ' After all, your fate was decided in a higher court,' said Mr. Vane, still with a bland and ex pressionless smile. ' Is your fate decided ?' asked Lady Cheshire, with an air of simple curiosity, untempered by personal spite. ' I thought it was still pending.' ' In a lady's case the last word is never spoken,' said Captain Graham, rousing himself from an abstruse calculation as to how he should stand if all his fancies managed to get home this meeting, and cutting into the discussion with the mistaken idea that he was taking the sting out of his wife's remarks. Mrs. Turton looked down idly at the jingling, glittering bangles she was twisting round one slender wrist. vol. 1. 2"], [28, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 18 'There is always,' she observed, with an assent ing nod and a smile unintentionally sad, ' always someone else to come \u2014 someone prettier, someone younger, someone without a past, and with all the future in her favour. If Lady Violet Johnson only learns how to use the weapons with which nature has armed her, I shall have to cease to plume myself on my looks, and Lady Cheshire must cease ' She stopped short, laughing softly. ' No, Lady Cheshire will go on always as she is \u2014 for ever young, and with a husband always at her feet. She is our social type of youth and love.' ' In the meantime, where is the bride ?' asked Lady Hope, rising hastily from the sofa, to end a sparring-match which her guests were beginning to wickedly enjoy. ' And the bridegroom?' asked Lady Marcia."], [29, "CHAPTER II. LADY VASHTI. Neither bride nor bridegroom was forthcoming. The gong had sounded some minutes before, and the circle round the fire had been gradually in creased by the arrival of the ' Duchess,' Susan Lady Maybury, and the rest of the house-party. Even the bachelors had come in, and were standing together \u2014 a good-looking group \u2014 awaiting their instructions. Their host, Sh- Evelyn Hope, having a healthy appetite after a day spent in the open air, and very little regard for anyone but himself, pooh-poohed the idea of waiting ; and, as the order"], [30, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 20 of their going had been upset, his wife proposed that they should draw for partners. ' Peas and ducks, turkey and sausages, are too materialistic. Let us have classic lovers for a change !' cried Lettice ; and, without waiting for any opposition, she took a mean advantage of her recently-finished education hastily to scribble some names on slips of paper, while the majority, less learned in classics, looked on in nervous appre hension. ' I have not the least idea who was Sappho's lover,' said Mrs. Turton, holding up the paper she had drawn, with a charming air of innocent inquiry. 'lam,' said Lord Anthony Fitz-Glyn, promptly crumpling up a slip of unread paper and slipping it into his waistcoat-pocket. At the same moment the elderly, exuberant"], [31, "LADY VASHTI 21 Marchioness, who was smiling rather anxiously at the perplexity of her neighbours, allowed herself to be led off unwillingly by a beardless boy from the barracks at Combley, who himself felt victimized, and would have been furious had he known that he was acting Phaon to his partner's Ariadne, under a misapprehension for which his own defective classics were to blame. Somehow \u2014 anyhow, in fact \u2014 everyone got sorted, until only Lady Marcia was left a hapless Eurydice looking out for Orpheus, while Horace Vane was a Hero-less Leander. ' I am no more a hero than you are, but I suppose we must go in together,' grumbled Lady Marcia, laughing. As they crossed the hall Kenneth Johnson \u2014 a big, florid young man, with a good figure and a style that even in evening dress was loud \u2014 joined them. He made some apologies"], [32, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 22 for his own and his wife's misdemeanours, with a slighting reference to the bad habits of women where punctuality was concerned, which made them exchange meaning glances as he passed on. ' Rather early for him to have discovered that his idol has a flaw, is it not ?' asked Vane, caress ing his short, fair beard. ' My experience \u2014 all the wider, perhaps, because not personal \u2014 is that the sooner disillusionment sets in, the sooner the pain of it is over. People should be taken matrimonially on the hire system, like pianos. Three years' trial, and an asylum then for all the failures. The first year of married life is a terrible experience, so I am told.' ' Then, the sweetness of the honeymoon said Mr. Vane. ' Is a myth ! When you marry \u2014"], [33, "LADY VASHTI 23 ' I assure you that I have no matrimonial inten tions,' he interposed quickly. ' Don't,' exclaimed Lady Marcia, raising a small gloved hand in merry protestation ; ' don't rob our temporary intercourse of half its charm. Possi bility, even without probability, is in such cases a sauce to the plain foods of life. I like to presume even where I cannot hope.' ' You need do neither. You have only to throw the handkerchief,' he answered, with a grave obeisance. There was a buzz of disjointed conversation as they settled into their chairs, and presently the door was thrown open, Lady Violet Johnson swept through the room, and, with a hurriedly- whispered excuse as she passed her hostess, took possession of the only empty seat. This happened to be on the opposite side of the table to Lady Marcia Legh,"], [34, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 24 who dropped her spoon, and allowed her half finished soup to be taken away that she might indulge her curiosity by a good look at the new comer. Nothing had been said in excess of the truth ; indeed, in spite of all that had been rumoured in her praise, Lady Violet's beauty came as a surprise upon the one or two who now saw her for the firs t time. Moreover, there was a strong vitality and magnetic force about her that sent a sympathetic, disturbing thrill through the well-organized and conventional members of the party. That she should sweep like a whirlwind into her place was natural, perhaps, as she was late ; but haste did not account for the passion in her face or for her storm-swept eyes, as with a glance she took in her surroundings. Her beautiful head, crowned only by her golden hair, was held up"], [35, "LADY VASHTI 25 splendidly ; her bare shoulders, white as milk against the plain folds of her emerald-green velvet gown, only made the flushed colour in her cheeks the more apparent ; and her red lips gave the im pression that they would have been quivering if they had not been so firmly pressed together. Queenlike she was ; but it was offended majesty that was suggested by her attitude and proud expression. ' Queen Vashti !' murmured Lady Marcia to her self, as she remembered Long's celebrated picture of the outraged queen refusing to go in before the king when he and his boon-companions were drunk with wine. She remembered the passionate blue eyes, suffused with unshed tears \u2014 the wraths ul yet despairing glance ; it was all once more before her now : while, with feminine quickness, she noticed that the splendid ornaments of which her niece had"], [36, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 26 spoken were missing, though they had evidently been put on in the first instance. There were some faint pink marks at the base of Lady Violet's slim throat, and her hair was slightly disordered just above her brow, as though a coronet had been hastily removed. It was clear as day that the girl had resented her husband's wish that she should show off all her new possessions. ' She is certainly a lovely woman,' said Lady Marcia to her companion, who had been making unanswered remarks for the last five minutes. ' Lovely, no doubt,' was his rejoinder ; ' but the beauty is of too indignant a type to be entirely \" to my taste.\" ' In civilized circles anything tragic is always transitory. The silence that followed the bride's entrance only lasted a moment, and presently she was able to make a fair pretence of eating and"], [37, "LADY VASHTI 27 drinking, and to give more or less relevant replies to the remarks made by her neighbours ; while all the time above the ringing sounds of knives and forks on silver plate, and the cheery chatter that centred round Lady Marcia Legh, she could hear her husband's voice, pitched in a loud, defiant key, and evidently the cause of all the merriment at his end of the table. It was a relief to her when the meal was over, and she found herself in a quiet corner of the drawing-room, where the lights were mercifully shaded, and she was no longer obliged to be on the qui vive, lest by an inadvertent remark or in opportune silence she should draw attention to her own agony of mind. She was not alone, but Susan Lady Maybury, who sat on the sofa, would expect nothing from her but an intelligent interest in her fluent comments upon men and manners."], [38, "28 VASHTI AND ESTHER 'Well, Lady Violet, and what's the noos?' she began, taking advantage of the comparative privacy in which she found herself furtively to arrange her elaborately-dressed hair, which rumour said was removable at will, and probably said rightly, as the angle was often uncertain, while the colour ranged from a greenish yellow to metallic gold. ' What's the latest noos ? You are beginning to know all the people now.' ' I have been introduced to most of them,' replied Violet, with an indifferent reserve. ' Oh, well, if you know them by name, it won't take you very long to know them by reputation.

'I have not spoken to her yet. I have often wished to meet her. They say she knows everyone of note ; they say, too, that she is always bored by stupid people.' ' I don't think that can be true. She must know a great many,' mused Lady Maybury. Silence fell between them for a moment ; but from a little distance off, where a group of women had gathered under a well-shaded hanging elec trolier, there came a rippling sound of laughter, as one of them \u2014 a pretty, pale-faced woman in a rather dowdy black frock, with a diamond bird erect above her forehead \u2014 every now and then made what was evidently a telling remark.

STORM-SIGNALS. A strange thing had happened that night to Lady Marcia Legh : she had actually lain awake and thinking for a full hour, before she fell asleep, and when she awoke again the next morning it was with a confused sense of mingled curiosity and uneasi ness that she recalled an incident of the preceding evening known to herself alone. The night had been very clear and fine, with a bright moon shining, and the air so still that Lady Marcia, as she stepped outside the open French window (provoking Lady Maybury's in-"], [50, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 40 dignant comment upon her Providence-tempting imprudence), could plainly hear the sound of voices \u2014 a man's voice laughing and assertive, and a woman's echoing very faintly in reply \u2014 from a clump of bushes near the lake below the terrace. Tbe circumstance struck her as strange, and a sudden whim seized her to find out who were the pair of lovers constrained to do their courting out of doors. The night was fine enough to tempt out any young man for a smoke, but a rapid backward glance round the drawing-room showed Lady Marcia that no lady was missing. It might be two of the servants ; it might be burglars ; and it was to Lady Marcia's credit that this last timorous surmise had left her still undaunted. Writh a cautious glance behind her to make sure that she was not observed, she gathered up her skirts, and tripped lightly down the terrace steps"], [51, "STORM-SIGNALS 41 to the water's edge, without a tremor, save of cold ; and even when she found that she must leave the gravelled path to reach the place where a few moments ago she had seen something like the end of a lighted cigar, she only hesitated a moment,' and then picked her way daintily on the tips of her toes over the soft dewy grass. The voices had ceased as she came out, and the small red light, which had attracted her notice, had disappeared. Lady Marcia scarcely expected to see anything as she peeped through the bushes, therefore the surprise was greater when she came upon a very pretty picture. A girl stood leaning over the lake to see her reflection in the water. A dark red cloak she had been wearing had fallen to the ground, and lay there in a circled heap around her. Her neat gray woollen frock was slightly opened at the throat, and she was holding it back"], [52, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 42 with both hands. Her small head had no other covering than its close plaits of soft dark hah. For the moment Lady Marcia, who had no scruples about giving advice, thought of breaking in upon what seemed a silly display of vanity with a warning lecture upon coughs and colds ; but as the moon sailed out from behind a dark cloud, and a stream of light fell straight upon them, tbe girl moved her head, and as she strained her neck to see more clearly, Lady Marcia also caught sight of what was on it, and partly understood the meaning of this unrehearsed tableau. Round the girl's little throat there glittered a necklace of bright green stones set squarely with white crystals, and a hanging pear-shaped pendant fell on her breast. It was this, not herself, that the girl was admiring, and her delight was very plainly shown"], [53, "STORM-SIGNALS 43 in her bright dimpling cheeks and on her pretty parted lips. Suddenly a sound disturbed her. She turned her startled eyes in Lady Marcia's direction ; and that lady, regardless of her dignity and years, promptly dipped down, and remained in a squatting attitude until she guessed, by certain sounds and a succeeding silence, that the girl had gone and that the coast was clear. What had so struck Lady Marcia that she could not restrain a gasp of surprise was the coincidence that Lady Violet Johnson should have appeared that evenhig without the jewels which were to have been worn with her green gown, and that here, in this unlikely spot, someone else, in a very much inferior position, should have been wearing a neck lace, which, if it had been real (of course it was not), might have been bought to match those"], [54, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 44 jewels. As she scurried back to the house, shiver ing with cold, she wondered whether the necklace of which Lettice had spoken had been stolen, and whether this were, after all, the reason of the bride's sensational appearance without a jewel of any sort upon her gown or in her hair. She had it in her mind immediately to ask some questions on the subject ; but when she re entered the drawing-room she found that Lady Violet had already taken her departure. Kenneth Johnson, however, was there, standing in the centre of the room looking rather heated, and talking in excited tones to Lord Hartrey, whose acquaintance he had only just made. Waving aside expostulatory remarks upon her reappearance, Lady Marcia went straight up to her nephew, with the intention of satisfying her curiosity at once ; but the contemplated question was frozen"], [55, "STORM-SIGNALS 45 on her lips as her sharp eyes detected that his evening shoes were wet and soiled with gravel. She made no attempt to solve the problem then, but her prudent silence only made her think the more. During the night she had imagined every con ceivable situation, each more romantic, and there fore more unlikely than the last. By the sober light of day, however, she was inclined to laugh at all her fancies. She even doubted whether that sylvan scene were real or a dream, until, without rousing the suspicions of her maid \u2014 who, like all her class, conceived it to be her duty to discover the most secret actions, and even the thoughts, of her mistress \u2014 she contrived to touch the hem of the Watteau gown that she had worn the night before, and found it soiled. Her slippers, too (new ones), bore the mark of damp upon their soles. There"], [56, "46 VASHTI AND ESTHER was no doubt that she had seen a girl with a green necklace. It only remained to find some natural commonplace reason for what had seemed so very strange. As she left her room Lady Violet Johnson came along the corridor, and at the same moment Lady Cheshire was heard calling out to her young hus band in an adjoining room : ' The blue tie, duckie ! the one that matches your eyes. And I'll part your hair.' Lady Marcia laughed outright, and there was a responsive smile in Lady Violet's eyes as the elder woman introduced herself, and immediately adopted her nephew's wife as a niece by a little illusive kiss, lost somewhere in the region of the girl's hair, where it swept backward from behind her ears, but which was duly valued by the recipient as a sign of friendly feeling."], [57, "5 TORM-SIGNALS 47 They went downstairs together. ' Lady Cheshire and her \" blue-eyed \" boy will not be clown to breakfast. The gong sounded some time ago,' said Lady Marcia. ' Yesterday morning nobody was down but Lettice and myself.' Lady Marcia nodded sagely. ' This morning it will be a different thing. Har trey, Johnny Lessington and Tony Fitz-Glyn are here, and they are sure to start for the coverts before ten. I never know how Sybil does it. It takes her quite two hours to dress at ordinary times, yet if any men are here for shooting, she manages to appear at a nine o'clock breakfast. \"The Duchess\" is sure to be down. She is always an early riser, and after the very latest ball is up by daybreak the next morning on charitable thoughts intent.

I told you so. It's something Japanese. Good morning, Sybil ; good - morning, Mrs. Turton ; good-morning, everybody! How early you all are.' And ' how smart !' she might have added. Violet felt very unimportant as she slipped mto a place beside her new-found aunt, envying the ease with which she immediately dropped into, and presently led, the conversation. Lady Hope had welcomed the new arrivals with a smiling nod and a wave of the hand that was meant to dispense with any formal greetings ; but even from a distance it was impossible not to be impressed by her elaborate"], [59, "STORM-SIGNALS 49 get-up in bright purple silk, soft in itself, but stiff with Oriental embroideries of gold. Mrs. Guy Turton was brilliant in dahlia-coloured cloth, and a bright green gauze sash wound round her made her look like some beautiful tropical bird. Lady7 Glaive, who was not famed for dressing well, wore an emerald-green velvet coat, which fell loosely from the shoulders, with no pretence to fit, and which had enormous lace ruffles falling round her throat and little hands. ' I don't like this new idea of dressing up for breakfast,' whispered Lady Marcia ; but the remark was so evidently meant to be of a consolatory nature, in face of the smart silk gown which she herself was wearing, that Violet flushed up, and felt all the more uncomfortable in her sober-hued, tailor-made attire.

But those who meant sport were already rising from the table, and some of the ladies got up to see them start. There was some good-natured chaff about John Lessington's smart suit from Tony Fitz-Glyn, who, whatever his faults, was not a masher ; and then Horace Vane, who, by some miscalculation of the time, came upon the scene as they were starting, was rallied upon his unsports manlike tastes. ' Horace Vane is always happier talking gossip by the fire,' explained Lady Marcia to her new niece. ' He can't sit a horse, he can't shoot, he won't skate (because it hurts), so no wonder he is devoted to town life. What is Evelyn saying ?' Violet had heard the remark, and, attaching"], [61, "STORM-SIGNALS 51 no importance to it, repeated it in all good faith. ' Sir Evelyn is chaffing my husband about that pretty girl in the village, Esther Gay. He says Kenneth had better stay at home with Mr. Vane, lest his gamekeeper should shoot him by mis take.' ' Why on earth should the gamekeeper do that ?' asked Lady Marcia. ' He is the girl's sweetheart, and was with her at the Combley fair, where we all went on Saturday. Everyone was raving about the girl, but no one spoke to her except Kenneth. He went in a merry-go-round with her just for fun, and to tease the gamekeeper \u2014 such a stern, odd-looking young fellow \u2014 who stood scowling at them all the time.' Lady Marcia did not reply, and presently, when the men had gone, and there was a reactionary lull,"], [62, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 52 she took an opportunity of talking to Lady Hope on the same subject, and drew from her some further information. Esther Gay was the daughter of the village publican, and though not actually engaged to Adam Mallard, the head-gamekeeper at Ladys meade, it was supposed that an engagement would be the result of the keeper's admiration, which was displayed with some aggressiveness on every possible occasion. The young man was respectable enough \u2014 ' too respectable,' said Lady Hope, with a contemptuous shrug of her shoulders. He preached out of doors, and was the head of a sect who called themselves Bible Christians, and were as intolerant and fanatical as any sect ever banded together in religion's name. That he should want to marry the daughter of a rollicking good fellow hke John"], [63, "STORM-SIGNALS 53 Gay, who served himself as liberally as he served his customers, and was consequently only sober on occasion ; and that John Gay, who had been publicly denounced by Mallard more than once, should, after all, entertain the idea of giving him his daughter, were problems only to be explained by the kaleidoscopic combinations which, ever since the world began, have been achieved by those brilliant bits of glass, of which the chief are youth, love, beauty, gold, ambition, power. Lady Marcia knew these people. She stay7ed with the Hopes once or twice every yTear, and it was her amiable habit to make friends wherever she went ; while a very human feeling, which it would be brutal to call curiosity7, kept her always well informed as to their movements. One thing, however, which she discovered in course of conver sation with her niece, struck her with surprise and"], [64, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 54 consternation. Lady Hope remarked, laughingly, that really Kenneth, for a newly-married man, had shown an extraordinary mterest in the girl. She added (still laughing) that he was the only one who had gone to church on Sunday, and that someone had seen him walking home with Esther, not through the woods, where they might have en countered Adam Mallard, but down a quiet country lane. Lady Marcia did not laugh in reply. To her it seemed anything but a jesting matter that Kenneth should be amusing himself after this dangerous fashion, while his young wife was unhappy \u2014 not with any real reason, perhaps, but from that vague disappointment which all women feel when they first face the facts of life. 'Lady Violet is so young and lovely,' she began. ' And so terribly stupid,' finished Lady Hope."], [65, "STORM-SIGNALS 55 ' She has no accomplishments. She dances a little, but only the oldest fashioned dances ; she had never seen the cotillon, and looked scandalized on Monday night when we danced the pas de quatre \u2014 especially at Molly Glaive, who was the life of the party.

She is, in fact, a wild Irish girl \u2014 not a statue, but a tomboy turned to stone. That Kenneth is bored is only a foregone conclusion.' Lady Marcia sighed.

That same day the men came back to luncheon, and afterwards Sir Evelyn Hope suggested that as many as pleased should drive over to Combley, which was their nearest town. Others made different plans ; from all of these Lady Marcia Legh excused herself on the plea of fatigue. Yet she had no intention of resting. So soon as the house was clear, she put on her bonnet and cloak and sallied out in the direction of the village inn, without any definite intention, but with an idea"], [68, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 58 that she might have a chance of seemg and perhaps speaking to Esther Gay. The distance was greater than she had thought, and it was nearly an hour before she reached the inn \u2014 a pretty cottage with a small garden which just now was gay with hollyhocks and roses at one side where there was a private entrance. To this Lady Marcia made her way, and was greeted on the threshold by Mrs. Gay, the mother of the man who owned the inn, and the grandmother of the pretty ghl who was the real object of this visit. ' Be it you, milady, at last ? I heard that you were at the Hall. I thought you were never corning to our parts again. Dear heart ! how cold you look, and how tired ! The walk were too much for you. Come in, milady, and rest.' The old woman's face \u2014 a very handsome face, with apple-red cheeks and silvery hair as a soft"], [69, "ESTHER GA V 59 framing \u2014 was aglow with pleasure. She drew her visitor indoors and to the fire, chafing her little gloved fingers all the time, and evidently admiring the handsome cloak and bright beflowered bonnet she was wearing. ' Are you alone ?' asked Lady Marcia, looking curiously around the bright, comfortable, but poorly furnished room. ' My grandchild be somewhere about \u2014 in her bedroom, no doubt. Girls be full of vanity.' ' I hear she has a reason to be vain. If she is like you- ' ' No, no, milady ; she do take after her mother. Her mother were a gipsy. Pretty enough and gentle enough, no less for that ; and Esther be all for the gipsies. Now, I were always fair-like.

' And your grandchild is pretty, too. I never saw her, you know. She was always at school.' ' There be not a prettier nor a sweeter maid in England, though I says it that hadn't ought to ' \u2014 stoutly. ' She is going to be married ?' ' Be she ? I'm none so sure of that.

It be nothing but putting ideas into other folks' heads.' ' And your grand-daughter \u2014 Esther ? Girls are not generally so devoted to religion,' remarked Lady Marcia, who heard a footstep overhead, and was anxious to gain all the information she could before being confronted with the girl whom she had come especially to see. Old Mrs. Gay was busy at the table with the hospitable intention of giving her visitor tea. 'Esther be like me,' she answered rather shortly. ' She do read her Bible and say her prayers at home, helping with the house, and in the dairy, too. Sometimes she do go to church, just to see the bonnets and gay dress of the ladies at the Hall ; but it be seldom we get a sight of them \u2014 in church.

Her head have been full of diamonds and such-like ever since \u2014 as though I knew the names of them ; I've something else to think on.' ' Well \u2014 well '?' asked Lady Marcia with sup pressed excitement. But the old lady, in looking for a missing tea spoon, lost the thread of her story. ' My son \u2014 Esther's father \u2014 he be fond of the good things of this world; men most times are. He'd like his girl to marry well, and I'm not saying that Adam be not a good lad and a good match, for all he be so terrible severe. And John, though he be fond of his glass and his joke, and don't like to be bothered about his soul in and out of season, he know the lad be a good lad, and that he would make Esther comfortable, if not to say gay.

The door opened, and Esther stood upon the threshold. In a moment Lady Marcia recognised the girl she had seen by the lake ; but as instantly she dismissed the idea, which had grown insensibly in her mind, that she was light of character, vain of her good looks, and fond of admiration. This might have been some young prophetess standing there in the simplest blue serge gown, with a crimson cotton scarf neatly knotted round her throat, and with such an expression on her face as she might have worn had she just come from con verse with the angels, instead of from looking at herself in the glass, as her grandmother had hinted.

She scarcely raised her eyes to meet the curious gaze she felt was on her ; but through her thick tangled lashes she saw how Lady Marcia sat there breathlessly attentive, and a faint colour crept into her olive cheeks. ' Come here, child,' said Lady Marcia, and as she held her small brown lissom fingers she felt that they were cold and trembling. ' Is she strong ?' she asked quickly. ' She be nobbut a slip of a ghl. Ghls at her age are mostly kittle-kattle \u2014 one day ready to fly over the moon, and the next day quarrelling with their victuals.

' I do,' cried Lady Marcia with a sudden thrill of sympathy. ' I understand. If ever you are in trouble come to me.' Old Mrs. Gay, who had never had an ache of sentimental pain and very few physical qualms, burst into a laugh in which was something of derision. ' What should ail the girl ? She have everything a girl can want \u2014 in reason,' she said impatiently, as she put up a chair to the table and laid a cup of tea and some thin brown bread and butter handy for her guest.

' Bun, child, run ! If that's the coach stop it, and tell Sir Evelyn I am here,' she exclaimed ; and then, not content with having sent an emissary, followed in her footsteps, and was in the porch as the girl ran out on to the road to do her bidding. Sir Evelyn pulled up short, and the plunging horses took up all his attention for a moment, while Esther ran back into the shadow of the porch.

Then as Kenneth retreated with a good-natured laugh and shrug of his broad shoulders, she turned to Esther Gay. ' That was my nephew,' she observed, watching the girl's face, but uncertain whether it was the shadow or deep feeling that made her seem so pale. ' And that lady sitting by Sir Evelyn on the box seat ' ' That lovely lady in purple velvet with the golden hair?' breathed Esther softly. ' Is my nephew's wife,' said Lady Marcia."], [78, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 68 Not a sound, not a movement of surprise, only a slight shiver, which might well be caused by cold, as the girl wore nothing but that knotted kerchief over her serge frock. Lady Marcia, however, was blessed with wonderfully keen vision, and she saw that the light had died out of her eyes, and knew that all the blood had left her cheeks. For an instant a cruel thought held Lady Marcia in pos session. The wind swept through the open porch, and the point of the girl's kerchief fluttered up. It needed only a touch, an intentionally awkward movement, and her curious suspicion might be satisfied at once. At such close quarters, if Esther happened to be wearing her green necklace, she could see if it were really formed only of glass beads. \u25a0 The girl was helpless, unprepared.

Her husband ' 'He must worship her!' cried Esther in a low, hushed tone. Lady Marcia pursed her lips with acrid meaning, but forbore to make a satirical remark, with some thing of the same feeling that inclines the least religious to postpone a joke whilst standing near the altar of a church, even where there is no service.

Lady Marcia's fingers just touched Esther's hands, as she held them tightly clasped against her breast. ' Good-bye, child,' she said kindly. The next moment she was clambering up the ladder, and when settled in her seat she looked back with compunction and growing pity in her eyes. There was something very noble about the girl, and a strange charm, as she stood there, the wind blowing the loose strands of her dark hah about her face, and still fluttering the ends of her kerchief, though it was so firmly fastened down.

It was Long's companion picture to ' Vashti ' \u2014 the picture of Esther who became queen in Vashti's stead \u2014 that Lady Marcia remembered. This ghl might have sat as a model for that picture. 'Do you read your Bible, Horace? Do you know the story of Vashti and Esther ?' she asked bluntly of her neighbour, who stared at her in blank amazement.

In the meantime, Lady Marcia was wondering whether he had fathomed the meaning of her inquiry ; whether he saw what was going on ; whether, indeed, there was anything to see. Kenneth's wife was most deeply interested in Kenneth's actions, and she seemed to notice nothing. She stole a glance at Violet, who was seated just in front of her on the box-seat by Sir Evelyn Hope.

His wife, of whom Violet had remarked that she liked to ' pair ' her guests, was also not averse to concern herself solely with the amusement of one (male) friend. She had in the imitative days of early married life gone with her husband to visit Lady Greye, a very smart beauty, with money of her own, and such independent views that she had furnished a com plete suite of private apartments, which apartments had even included a dinmg-room, where she some times entertained one guest at dinner.

These arrangements, while agreeable to some, were embarrassing to others who preferred to move in wider circles and join in general conversations.

From the first day of their meeting, Mrs. Turton had determined to attach him to the train of her admirers. She was only waiting for an opportunity to let him know his happy fate. Kenneth was in a quandary. In a light-hearted moment, while still he had scarcely admitted to himself that his marriage was a failure, he had plunged into a flirtation with Esther Gay, which she, who was naturally serious-minded, had taken in deep earnest. The meeting at the fair had, as Lady Hope discovered, been followed by a meeting in church, which was the occasion of a walk together through the quiet country lanes.

So far nothmg had been said or done that all the world might not have seen or heard. Kenneth, though he had gone the pace hi his bachelor days, had never been a scoundrel. If he could not fail to see the impression he had made upon the girl's heart in every shy glad movement and suddenly averted glance, he took no great advantage of it.

She was trembling with nervousness, and so con fused that Kenneth Johnson, in trying to console her, said too much. Carried away by the force of his own eloquence, he had slipped his arm round her waist, as he led her away to a more secluded spot. He was kissing her before he realized what he was doing ; but even then, though he was scarcely sober, there was something in the girl's expression, her trustful acceptance of his light eager words of love, that held him in check.

Somethmg, however, had pre vented her from leaving the house, and after an hour's waiting, which naturally had the effect of weakening his good resolutions and stimulating a mere fancy into a more serious emotion, he went to join the shooting-party, feeling less sure of what he should say when they met.

Yet, when he was convinced that the fact of his marriage was no secret, he became familiarized with the idea. It seemed a less impassable barrier between them. Had Esther ever deceived herself with the idea that such a love meant marriage ?

If she were un happy she made a brave show ; there was no sign of weakness or grief in her demeanour. At dinner and afterwards she was unusually animated and unusually self-assured.

Fortunately, fear was largely mingled with his growing love of Lady Violet.

Lady Marcia Legh was on the steps ; it was she who stayed near Violet to the last, and looked after her until she could no longer see the beautiful proud face and flashing eyes.

' Do you think, milady, that Adam Mallard's done it ?' Lady Marcia started. ' Done what, William ?' 'Made away with Esther Gay7. He's a terrible temper, is Adam.

They must have been lovers, or Kenneth would not have given her the emerald necklace. But did he give it ? Adam had declared that the necklace was a fairing he himself had given to his sweetheart.
