It was a very attractive room \u2014 a drawing room, perfectly harmonious as to colour and decoration, eminently up-to-date as to fittings ; but the only expression in the eyes of its solitary occupant was one of vague dis satisfaction. Mrs. Smith-Clouston stood by the fern filled fire-place, and looked protestingly about her. She was intimately acquainted with the room. Also, she had been waiting now for nearly half-an-hour.

She sauntered across ; and then she stopped, and a spark of interest came into her pale eyes. On the ledge of the escritoire, arranged there by the servant, were two letters, which had arrived by the last post. One was addressed to \" Miss Heseltine, 1 1 5, Bruton Street, W.,\" in a strong, upright, man's hand ; the other, in sprawling, illiterate characters, to \"Miss Heseltine, 115, Bruton Street, Hyde Park, London.\" The latter Mrs. Smith-Clouston merely glanced at with the slightest possible shrug of her shoulders. It was the former upon which her eyes were fastened with lively curiosity. \" I wonder whether she means it ? \" she said to herself. \" It looks like it.

She was tall, well-pro portioned, graceful with the unconscious ease of absolute self-possession, in spite of certain little brusqueries of manner. Her features were excellent ; but no one on first meeting Bride Heseltine ever thought of her as hand some. Exactly what constituted her charm her friends would have been puzzled to say. They might have declared that she was brilliant, eccentric, kind-hearted, a good talker, a good listener, or what not, each according to his or her individual fancy ; and none of their statements would have accurately represented the fact.

The protesting annoy ance of expression with which the latter had turned to receive her hostess died feebly out, and Mrs. Smith-Clouston subsided into an easy-chair, saying, with mild reproach ; \" I know no one in London but you, Bride, who would have the face to waste half-an hour of another woman's time in the busiest week of June ; and I know no one but you for whom I would have waited.\" Miss Heseltine laughed slightly.

Mrs. Smith-Clouston did not speak, but her eyes brightened a little as they followed the vigorous figure.

It was she who broke the silence. \" If you keep your visitors waiting for half an-hour, Bride,\" she said, with a little laugh, but with eyes that were observant of Miss Heseltine, \" they will inevitably look about the room for entertainment.

She was standing erect now, the letters clenched in her hand as though every nerve and muscle had suddenly contracted. There was a moment's pause. Mrs. Smith- Clouston felt vaguely bewildered. Before she could collect herself Miss Heseltine said slowly, and in a strange, grating voice, \" Say that again, Alice. I\u2014 didn't understand ! \" \" About Stephen Gore's name ? It's quite simple. His father was a Mr. Baker\u2014 it was a good family, but horribly poor, as I said.

And now I must really go, dear ! Good-bye ! Again and again, so glad ! \" She kissed Miss Heseltine with effusion, and was rather surprised to find her embrace only mechanically returned. A few moments later the front door closed upon her, and Miss Heseltine turned and went slowly back into the drawing-room. Her face had changed in the last few moments strangely and completely. It was quite white. She lifted her hand to her head, forgetting, apparently, the letters crushed within it. They fell at her feet, and she stood staring down at them. \" It's a common name,\" she said, half aloud \u2014 \" a common name ! \""], [27, "ANOTHER FREAK 23 At that instant the front-door bell rang sharply, and the sound seemed to break up at once all the strange numbness that hung about her.

To-morrow \u2014 at this time to morrow \u2014 tell him.\" Then she turned and went rapidly on up the stairs. II. Miss Heseltine's drawing-room was empty when, at half-past five on the following after noon, Mr. Stephen Gore was shown into it. Stephen Gore had been described as a \" good-looking fellow \" ever since he emerged from boyhood ; and now, at forty-three, he remained a \" good-looking fellow \" still. He was tall, well built, and well set up ; and"], [28, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 24 the slight touch of grey about his temples gave additional character to his face. His features were rather worn and lined, as though he had lived vigorously. His eyes were very pleasant, full of fire, full of thought ; at this particular moment full of something deeper still. It was a clever face, and yet Stephen Gore had never \" done anything\" ; he had made no conspicuous use even of his unexpected wealth, or the position it brought him, except to enjoy. There were lines about his mouth which five years before had threatened to tinge his whole expression with the cynicism of a man who feels that Fate has been hard on him ; and though since then Fate had changed her tactics, the traces of her earlier dealings with him were not wholly to be effaced.

Miss Heseltine had come in very quietly, and she gave him her hand in silence. She was very pale, and perhaps it was her pallor which gave so strange an expression to her face. She moved, as soon as he released her hand, and sat down with her back to the window. \" Won't you sit down ? \" she said. Trivial as were the words, the tone was noticeable. All the rather hard decision usually characteristic of her voice was absent ; it was dignified, composed, and indescribably womanly. It made a quite indefinite impression upon Stephen Gore. He seated himself in silence, and then said, with an instinctive softening of his own voice ; \" It was stupid of me to come yesterday !

She moved for the first time, drawing herself upright in her chair. Something in her manner, or in the depths of her grey eyes, seemed suddenly to check Stephen Gore's excitement. He stood motionless, looking down at her, as she went on in a steady, rather hoarse voice. \" Two summers ago,\" she said, looking, not at him, but straight before her, \" I had a house at Abbotsmead, in Somersetshire.

And I determined when I came back to town to find him, if I could.\" Miss Heseltine paused. She had gone steadily on from sentence to sentence with no break of any kind. She did not move now, or glance at the figure by her side. \"The name she gave me was Stephen Baker,\" she said. \" I was told yesterday that, five years ago, that was your name.\" There was a moment's heavy silence. Over Stephen Gore's eager face a dull flush had stolen. He turned away, and stood with his head bent down, leaning one arm on the mantelpiece. \"Be as lenient with me as you can,\" he said, between his set teeth. Miss Heseltine's head was bowed for a moment, like that of a woman in extremity of physical pain. Then she lifted it again, her pale face quite quiet. She raised her hand and pushed the hair from her forehead. \" I knew it,\" she said. A long, long pause.

Stephen Gore stood with his clenched hand resting on the back of a chair, his face at once alert and set, as in intense realization of the necessities of the moment. It was he who broke the silence. \" What you propose is possible, of course, from one point of view.

There were fifteen years between that brother and sister ; but there was very little of the paternal element about his relations with her. Kitty's mother had died when she was born, and for twelve years her father and her big brother had been her devoted slaves and play fellows ; Jack had been victimized and tyran nized over, as if his small sister had been in her twenties, instead of not yet in her teens. Then the father died ; and the brother and sister lived on together alone, in the large, old-"], [52, "48 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS fashioned country house \u2014 lived a happy, unconventional life, very popular in the neighbourhood, and always delighting in filling their house with friends. But before very long John Faulkner became conscious of a difficulty for which, in his innocence, he had been so entirely unpre pared, that it was some time before he thoroughly realized whence it arose. Kitty was growing up. He had, of course, expected this ; though perhaps she had accomplished the process somewhat rapidly. But all girls grew up, sooner or later ; and, on the whole, grown-up girls were nicer than not grown up girls \u2014 though Kitty had been sweet in every stage of her existence. Kitty was ex tremely pretty. That also was quite as it should be \u2014 he liked pretty girls. But \u2014 Kitty was an outrageous little flirt. Now John Faulkner, though a sensible man enough, had never had any objection to a little flirtation on his own account ; in fact, he had rather liked it. But that was a very different matter. To pick up the glove"], [53, "KITTY'S VICTIM 49 thrown down by a pretty flirt, is one thing ; to be responsible for that same pretty flirt', to be made to feel abjectly apologetic to her victim, to be incessantly tormented by anxiety as to what her next proceeding may be, is quite another. John Faulkner, when this new phase of Kitty's development finally dawned upon him, when brotherly blindness could no longer deceive him, decided, with commendable promptitude, that the moment had arrived when his authority\u2014 the authority at once of elder brother and guardian\u2014 must be exerted once and for all. Kitty must not, Kitty should not flirt. The shock he experienced, the frightful state of confusion into which he was thrown, by the result of his announcement of this decision, is not to be described. His mandate was entirely ineffectual. Kitty continued to flirt. The authority which he had flattered himself was only in abeyance, turned out to be a pleasing fiction. Kitty continued to flirt ; or rather, as she felt her powers develop, Kitty flirted harder than ever. D"], [54, "50 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS From that time forth John Faulkner's cheery, easy-going life became, as he fre quently assured his torment with the deepest pathos, hardly worth living. He existed in a continual state of uneasy expectation of disaster. He regarded his fellow-men \u2014 such of his fellow-men, at least, as came in contact with Kitty \u2014 with feelings of mingled pity and self-reproach. He did his best for them ; he tried alternately argument, entreaty, and command. It was all in vain. Kitty simply declined to take the question seriously. The more perplexed and harassed he became, the more she seemed to enjoy herself. This morning's interview had been a repeti tion of many that had preceded it. He had called her into the library \u2014 there was a certain solemnity about the library which he vaguely hoped might be a help to him \u2014 in sheer desperation, feeling that something really must be done.

But instead"], [55, "KITTY'S VICTIM 51 of the new scene which he had rehearsed so carefully \u2014 by himself \u2014 they had only gone through one of the old scenes over again. He resigned himself, as usual, with a deep sigh, and being of a sanguine disposition, determined to hope for the best. Kitty proceeded to change the subject. \" What a lot of letters, Jack ! \" she said, with every appearance of the keenest interest. He fell into the little trap at once. \" There's one from Lindsay,\" he answered. \"He's coming by the 6.15.

If I am not back, will you be a good, serious Kitty, and receive him nicely for me?\" \" Aren't you afraid, Jack ? \" She was very busily engaged in folding her pocket-handkerchief into patterns \u2014 much too busily engaged to look up at him \u2014 and her serious voice was shaking with mischief. He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into a regular roar of laughter."], [56, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 52 \"If you only knew him!\" he gasped at last. \" Oh, Kit, if you only knew him. No, my dear, you'll hardly believe it, but I'm not in the least afraid, not in the very least.\" \" Why, Jack, what is he like?\" said Kitty, with naive astonishment. \" He won't interest you, my dear. I wish I thought he would. He's much too \u2014 too solid and sensible. I'm afraid you'll find him a little dull. Come, be a good girl, and promise me to be nice to him, for your old brother's sake, even if he does bore you a bit. He's a thorough good sort at the bottom.\" \" What is he at the top ? \" \" Well \u2014 at the top there's no denying that he's just a trifle solemn. He's Scotch, you know, very Scotch in some ways.\" He looked at her a little wistfully as he spoke. He was really anxious that she should neither laugh at, nor be bored by, the man he so much liked and respected ; and he could not help feeling that either or both these contingencies might possibly come to pass. But one of those sweet impulses which"], [57, "KITTY'S VICTIM 53 made her so irresistibly charming, which made it so utterly impossible to do anything but condone all her little faults and failings, seized upon Kitty at this moment. She put her arms round him again, and laid her cheek on his shoulder, with a quick little gesture that was inexpressibly sweet and loving. \" Dear old boy,\" she said, with a pretty seriousness \u2014 real this time \u2014 in her voice and manner, \" I know just what you want, and I'll be the best girl you ever saw. I do plague you sometimes, I'm afraid ; and you're a dear I I'll be a perfect angel to your model friend to make it up. There ! you never saw anything so good as I'll be.\" Five o'clock that same evening found Kitty sitting in state, prepared to fulfil her promise to the very letter, and looking as if the active verb \" to flirt \" was unknown in her vocabulary. She had ordered tea in the big drawing-room \u2014 an apartment which always had a distinctly solemnizing effect upon her \u2014 and she had, after much consideration, arrayed herself in a brown velvet gown, which she had finally"], [58, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 54 decided upon as \"quite grandmotherly, and just the thing.\" She was sitting, from the same point of view, in a high-backed chair, with her small feet sedately crossed on the fender, when the door-bell rang, and she rose quickly, meaning to go and meet her guest. But she stopped in much-amused mock perplexity. Would that be dignified? Perhaps she ought to receive him in state in the drawing-room ! Which would be most proper? Finally she decided, with a little laugh, that hospitality must always be proper ; and she flew out of the room to make up for her delay. She was in far too great a hurry to see where she was going, in the rather dimly lighted passage, and in another instant she had cast herself into the very arms of a young man, who was coming towards her, accom panied by a servant. \" I beg your pardon ! \" she gasped, as she recovered her footing. \" It was my fault entirely,\" he said, removing the arm in which he had for the moment"], [59, "KITTY'S VICTIM 55 been compelled to embrace her. Then the ludicrous side of the situation seemed to strike them, and an irrepressible laugh broke from them simultaneously. \" My brother is out,\" said Kitty, recovering herself with an effort. \" He told me- \" She was looking up into the man's face as she spoke, and suddenly she stopped short. Surely there must be some mistake. This could not be the serious friend for whom she had prepared so majestic a reception. (The majestic reception, by the bye, had certainly been somewhat of a failure.) This was a boy, positively a jolly-looking boy, very little older than herself apparently. What did it mean ? Who was it? Her perplexity entirely deprived her of speech. He stood waiting, evidently sur prised at her sudden pause ; and matters had apparently come to a dead-lock when another figure came down the passage \u2014 a tall man, with a grave, formal manner, who bowed to her ceremoniously, and said ; \" I will require to apologize to you, Miss"], [60, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 56 i Faulkner, for this inopportune arrival. Had any other train been available, I should most certainly not have dreamt of arriving at a time inconvenient to my friend John.\" Kitty gasped. This must be Andrew Lindsay, John's serious friend \u2014 this must be the solemn Scotchman for whom she had been prepared ; and a fervent thanksgiving arose in her heart that she had not precipi tated herself into his arms. But then \u2014 into whose arms had she precipitated herself? Who \u2014 who in the world was the boy ? With a mighty effort at presence of mind, she held out her hand to the elder man with i a smile\u2014 a smile which her embarrassment rendered even softer and prettier than usual. \" It is not inconvenient,\" she said, a little shyly, catching from him a certain ceremony which sat most delightfully on her little figure and fresh young manner. \" It is not incon venient. I am always glad to welcome my brother's friends.\" \" But I like to know their names,\" she might have added, as she stole a little glance"], [61, "KITTY'S VICTIM 57 at the boy. However, neither man seemed to think his presence needed accounting for; and Kitty, with an undefined feeling that things might be clearer in a brighter light, led the way into the drawing-room, and proceeded to provide her visitors with tea in a state of the deepest perplexity, which never theless did not prevent her taking them in in a few quick, shy glances. The younger man, she decided at once, was \"jolly, but rather ugly.\" He looked very little over twenty, and nature had adorned him with sandy hair, irregular, freckled, good-tempered features, and merry blue eyes. He had a cheery laugh too, which broke out on the smallest provocation ; and there was something altogether brisk and alert about him which was doubtless emphasized by the contrast presented by the other man. Andrew Lindsay was indeed appalling, she said to herself ruefully. Never had she heard any one use such long words ; never had she heard any one speak so very, very slowly and deliberately. The temptation to break in"], [62, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 58 and finish his sentences for him was almost irresistible. But why had Jack never told her how very handsome his model friend was ? she thought, as she looked up at him when she gave him his cup. What a good face it was, and what beautiful, kind eyes. It really was a pity that he should be so dreadful. Between the difficulty she experienced in making conversation with the man she did know, and her state of utter bewilderment as to the identity of the man she did not know, she found that tea-party of three the most embarrassing function at which she had ever been forced to assist. She would have found it next to impossible to follow Andrew Lind say to the end of his sentences, even with a free mind. How could she be expected to do so when she kept discovering herself in the middle of his speeches on the verge of asking that boy \u2014 who looked as if he could be so amusing \u2014 who he was and what he had come for ? At last, to her unutterable relief, she heard her brother's voice in the hall, and the next moment he was in the room."], [63, "KITTY'S VICTIM 59 \" I'm so awfully sorry, Lindsay \u2014 \" he began. Then he caught sight of the younger man and stopped short. Andrew Lindsay seemed to think he was waiting for an introduction. \" I have the very greatest pleasure, my dear John,\" he began solemnly, in that soft, slow, Scotch tongue of his, which seemed to Kitty to harmonize so exactly with his ceremonious phrases and general gravity of demeanour, \" I have the very greatest pleasure in making known to you my brother Norman. It is most truly kind of you to have extended your in vitation to him.\" Then, in an instant, John Faulkner took in the whole terrible situation. He had under stood vaguely, ever since he had first known him, that Andrew Lindsay had a younger brother, who was a sailor. He had known, too, that they had no other near relations, and that, when the sailor was on shore, his home was with his brother.

He cast one pathetic glance at her as he shook hands with Norman Lindsay, and wel comed him with an effusion born of absolute despair.

They began immediately. Kitty commenced operations that same evening when she came down to dinner, looking absolutely bewitching, with a bright colour in her cheeks and a mischievous light dancing in her eyes, and took possession, without further delay, of the youthful and roving affections of Mr. Norman Lindsay. Her wretched brother's first impulse was to send her away ; but on second thoughts he felt pretty sure that his little tyrant would decline to go ; and it simply never entered his head to insist. He could not very well send his visitor away, nor did he quite see his way to explaining to his brother the perils by which he was surrounded. But to see the victim being lured on to the inevitable end under his own roof was really frightful !"], [66, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 62 Four people shut up together in a country house in the winter/skating, walking, visiting together, sharing a common stock of interests, pleasures, and jokes, very soon become inti mate. Before a week had gone by, things had come to such a pass that John Faulkner determined, with a blind faith in his own powers, wholly unwarranted by past experi ences, to \"talk to Kitty.\" He did talk to Kitty \u2014 with the usual result. Kitty was en tirely impervious to reason. He reminded her, pathetically, but somewhat rashly, that only on the day of the Lindsays' arrival she had promised to be good ! She reminded him that Mr. Norman Lind say had not been mentioned in the bond, and further pointed out what he was unable to deny, that her behaviour to Mr. Andrew Lindsay was irreproachable. Was she not serious politeness itself to him ? Was she not even letting him teach her botany ; and was it the time of the year for botany ? she added, looking suddenly at her brother with a little twinkle in her eyes."], [67, "KITTY'S VICTIM 63 Finally she assured him cheerfully that she wouldn't do it any more, if she could help it ; but if she couldn't help it, he needn't fuss himself in the least. Mr. Norman Lindsay understood perfectly ; he was \" that sort \" \u2014 all sailors were. With which enigmatical conso lation she hugged him and departed. Apparently, she found she could not help it ; and John Faulkner, instead of accepting the consolation, grew more perturbed in spirit day by day. The time had slipped away with what Andrew Lindsay characterized as \" pairfectly ameezing rapeedity \" ; and it was now six weeks since the night of the Lindsays' arrival. Andrew Lindsay had protested once or twice against making such a \" veesitation,\" as he called it ; but his protest had not been marked by much energy, and had resulted in no active measures. The winter days were growing short, and it was half-past four, but the lamps had not yet been lighted, and Kitty was sitting on the hearthrug in her own little sitting-room, her"], [68, "64 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS small figure lit up only by the dancing flames, waiting for tea, and for her visitors. Five o'clock tea was a great institution with the Faulkners, and it was an essential part of its general cosiness that they should have it when they were alone, or had only intimate friends with them, in Kitty's own sanctum, where no one was allowed without special invitation. Before they had been in the house three days this privilege had been extended by their little hostess with much condescension to both the Lindsays. They had availed themselves of it after their separate manners with proportionate gratitude, and whatever might be going on, whatever might be the counter-attractions even in the hunting and shooting lines, five o'clock never failed to find the three men assembled round her little tea-table : Andrew Lindsay, most polite ; Norman Lindsay, most devoted; the unhappy John Faulkner, harassed and helpless to the last degree. It was a very pretty, quaint little room, with a wide window-seat, which Norman Lindsay"], [69, "KITTY'S VICTIM 65 had blessed on more than one occasion, and a big oak fire-place. It was full of the quaint odds and ends of furniture in which Kitty delighted ; not too tidy, certainly, but pictur esque and homelike. Her sweet little per sonality seemed to hover in every corner ; and as she sat there on the rug, with one arm lean ing on a big oak chair, and her head resting against the soft, shining silk pillow she had pulled down to receive it, she seemed the culminating point of all the dainty pretti ness about her. She had a book in her hand \u2014 a learned-looking book upon botany \u2014 and as long as the light lasted she had pre sented the most delightfully incongruous ap pearance as she studied its dry pages with a frown of the utmost gravity and attention. How much was likely to remain in her pretty, curly head of the mass of interesting informa tion and elaborate Latin names she repeated to herself again and again \u2014 interlarded, some what to their mutual confusion, with scraps of reflection quite foreign to the matter \u2014 was, fortunately, a problem which concerned no one E"], [70, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 66 very closely. Now that the light. had gone, she was looking into the fire with a soft, tender expression in her brown eyes, which made them look strangely unlike themselves. The science of botany had apparently ceased to interest her. She had not to sit alone for very long. A hasty knock at the door was followed by as hasty an entrance ; and stumbling over chairs and tables in his headlong passage, Norman Lindsay crossed the room, and threw, first a mass of very wet green stuff, and then himself, down on the rug by her side. \" I've got it ! \" he said proudly and triumph antly. \" Such a business as I've had about it. I was wet through, and nearly in the river for good and all once. Oh, wasn't it cold, just ! Fresh water isn't like salt. But I was jolly glad to do it for you, Miss Kitty.

Norman Lindsay had certainly done his best to gratify her supposed desire for \" a good lot.\" It occurred to Kitty, as she contemplated his dripping offering with laughing eyes, that he must have laid the produce of the entire river at her feet. What in the world was she to do with it? She didn't want to hurt his feelings, ridiculous boy ; but she really couldn't have all that horrid wet stuff about. She glanced, in her perplexity, from the \"horrid wet stuff\" to its much-elated donor, and his expression of mingled devotion and self-satisfaction gave her thoughts a fresh turn.

She rose from the rug and seated herself on a low chair."], [72, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 68 \" Oh, Mr. Lindsay,\" she began, apparently overwhelmed with confusion, and touched beyond words by the delicate attention. \" Oh, how very, very kind of you ! But you shouldn't, you know. I can't bear to take it when I know it has cost you so much trouble. Were you as wet as it is, I wonder? You shouldn't do such dangerous things.\" His answer was incoherent, but apparently satisfactory ; for, after a good deal of coquet ting, Kitty was prevailed upon to accept his certainly bulky, if somewhat dilapidated offering, and finally did so with a gratitude which seemed almost disproportionate, as she immediately made him remove it to the kitchen premises. His return to his place on the rug was succeeded by a short silence. But Norman Lindsay was never quiet for long, and in a minute or two he said ; \"Where's Andrew, I wonder \u2014 and your brother ? \" There was a hardly-perceptible pause before she answered ;"], [73, "KITTY'S VICTIM 69 \" You don't seem able to exist comfortably for a single hour without that brother of yours, Mr. Norman.

I couldn't begin to tell you what he's done for me, ne'er-do-well that I am. He is unselfishness itself, my dear old solemn Andrew.\" There was no answer. Whether or no Kitty was prepared with one, before she could have spoken the door opened, and John Faulkner came in, followed by a servant with tea and lights. That John did not groan audibly at the sight of the two figures sitting there alone in the firelight, was due entirely to a positively Spartan effort of self-control. He cast a look of pathetic reproach at Kitty, and looked on helplessly at the proceedings which followed, first with the tea-kettle and then with the sugar-tongs, until he could bear it no longer, and threw himself headlong into the conversation with the utterly irrelevant observation ; \" Where's Andrew ? \" \" I fear I am a little late,\" said the slow grave voice, as the door opened quietly. \" Miss Faulkner, I must apologize.\""], [75, "KITTY'S VICTIM 71 He came straight up to her, and put something down on the tea-table by her side. \" The Potomagiton Densus,\" he said, as simply as if he were speaking his native Scotch. \"You mentioned that you required it.\" Kitty took the plant in her hand and looked up in his face, with a bright colour rising in her cheeks. \" Oh,\" she said, with a strange intonation in her voice, \" oh, thank you ! \" Norman Lindsay had apparently been petrified as he stood, his tea-cup half-way to his lips, his mouth open, and she had hardly uttered the words before he exclaimed in a tone of the utmost incredulity ; \" Andrew ! By Jove ! The idea ! Why, I never thought of your going for it. How how jolly rum of you ! Who'd have thought it ! I went for it ! \" \"That is unfortunate,\" observed Andrew Lindsay, calmly. \" There was no need that you should do so.\""], [76, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 72 \"There was no need that you should do so, you mean,\" retorted his brother, rather hotly. And then he added, boyishly enough ; \" Anyway, I got ever so much more. That's a silly little bit ! \" \"It is large enough for the purpose. Miss Faulkner would not require a room full of Potomagiton Densus.\" \" Where did you get it ? Tell us all about it. Didn't you have no end of a bother? Weren't you jolly wet ? \" \" It was no ' bother.' I was wet ; but it is just of no consequence.\" Andrew Lindsay uttered his last answer in his gravest tones, and said no more. He accepted the cup of tea which Kitty offered him, and went and sat down near John Faulkner. Kitty, with the bright colour still in her cheeks, and a strange excitement in her manner, turned to Norman Lindsay ; and before the end of the half-hour that followed, every hair on John Faulkner's head would certainly have been standing bolt upright, if"], [77, "KITTY'S VICTIM 73 its tendency to protest in that inconvenient manner against overwhelming horror and dismay were not the merest fable.

It was wholly out of the question, not to be thought of for an instant. But what would Andrew Lindsay say? How could he ever look him in the face again ? Would he not justly say that John Faulkner should have thought of all this before he allowed his sister to encourage the boy ? Allowed ! Andrew Lindsay had no sister. He would never understand the terrible position. Allowed, indeed ! The situa tion was appalling. He was sitting in his library the next morning, vainly endeavouring to read anything in the morning paper but various powerful speeches addressed by himself to Kitty, and to himself by the justly irate brother of Kitty's victim, when a little hesitating tap fell on the door.

She came right up to him, and going behind his chair, she began to play with his hair. He could feel that the little fingers were shaking. He did not speak, because he had no notion what to say to her, and there was a moment's silence. Then a very little voice said ; \"Jack.\" \" Yes, Kitty,\" he responded, with a sinking heart. \" Jack, dear; \" Well, Kitty.\""], [80, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 76 A long pause. \" I've got something to tell you, Jack.\" Another pause. \" It's about \u2014 it's about \u2014 Mr. Lindsay.\" Her voice had become so very tiny that the last words were hardly audible ; and turning his head that he might more easily hear her, he caught a glimpse of a sweet little face all flushed and quivering, and a pair of blue eyes very suspiciously bright. The next moment the face was pressed down on the top of his head ; and if ever a man was overwhelmed with trouble and perplexity of spirit, John Faulkner, as he felt something moistening his hair, was that unhappy man. \" You \u2014 you don't \u2014 you don't want to marry him, of \u2014 of course,\" he suggested, with a desperate and entirely unsuccessful attempt at a confident, matter-of-fact tone of voice. How devoutly he wished she would say that she did not, and how vain and futile he felt his words to be, even as he spoke them. \" I \u2014 I knew you'd be surprised,\" murmured the small, tremulous voice to the top of his"], [81, "KITTY'S VICTIM 77 head. \"So am I\u2014 dreadfully. But\u2014 yes, please, Jack.\" Then John Faulkner knew that there was no escape for him, that he must immediately nerve himself for the fray. He blew his nose with much ceremony, and opened the proceedings somewhat falteringly. \" Kitty, my dear,\" he said, \" let us talk about this.\" He drew her round on to his knee, still with her face hidden, and went on ; \" I know you will be reasonable, dear.\" How he knew it is a mystery \u2014 certainly not by experience. \" I'm quite sure you will believe that your old brother would not give you pain for the world, if he could help it ; but \u2014 but \u2014 in short \u2014 you see \u2014 \" Then, with sudden de speration, \"Kitty, it's quite impossible,\" he said. Kitty lifted her head with a start that nearly sent her altogether off his knee, and stared at him as if she thought he had suddenly taken leave of his senses. \" Jack ! \" she gasped. \" Impossible ! Jack, what do you mean ? Why ? \""], [82, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 78 Like most tender-hearted men, when they find themselves obliged to inflict pain, John Faulkner tried to take refuge in a passion. \" Kitty, I thought you were more sensible,\" he exclaimed, with much wrath. \"Why? Because the whole thing is utterly preposterous and absurd. In the first place, he is a mere boy, not old enough to know his own mind ; in the second, he is not at all the kind of young man I should like to see you marry ; and in the third, he is entirely dependent on his brother. And how I am to answer for it to Andrew Lindsay, if this affair does the boy permanent harm, is more than I can say. Kitty, I'm ashamed of you ! \" During this harangue, which poor John Faulkner had delivered with his eyes fixed on anything rather than Kitty, but with an energy and fire which were very much to his credit, Kitty had slipped from his knee. She was now standing before him, looking straight into his averted face ; and if he had glanced at her he would have been slightly astonished. The look of startled consternation with which she had"], [83, "KITTY'S VICTIM 79 received his first words had gradually changed to a look of perplexity, which in its turn had given way to an indescribable expression, in which a little shame and a great deal of mischief, amusement, and relief were inex tricably mixed. He did not look at her, how ever ; in fact, he was inwardly congratulating himself on his firmness in not doing so ; and, when he came to the end of his oratorical resources, she said, in a little pitiful voice that went to his very heart, and with a little twist of her mouth which, unfortunately, he did not see ; \" Really, Jack ? \" \" Yes, Kitty, really.\" \" I mustn't marry Mr. Lindsay ? \" \" Certainly not.\" \" It's quite impossible ? \" \" It's quite impossible, Kitty.\" A pause. He dared not trust himself to look at her, and she watched him for a minute or two, with the mischief in her face gaining ground with every second that passed."], [84, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 80 \"Very well,\" she said at last, in a very subdued and shaky voice, and with a little sob. \" Very well, Jack ; then perhaps you'll tell him \"\u2014sob\u2014 \" tell him yourself. I'll \"\u2014 sob, sob \u2014 \" I'll send him to you now.\" John Faulkner could hardly believe his senses. She had accepted his decision with out the faintest protest, and had actually gone there and then to send the victim to him. He could hear his step in the hall even then. Well, it would be comparatively easy to deal with him. How much there was in good sound reasoning after all. \" Now, Norman, my boy \" But there John Faulkner stopped abruptly. It was not Norman. Andrew Lindsay \u2014 Andrew \u2014 was coming towards him with a face and manner so utterly unlike himself, that John Faulkner could hardly believe the evidence of his own eyes \u2014 and they were staring pretty hard too. \" She will say nothing but that you require to see me,\" Andrew Lindsay said eagerly ; yes, eagerly and absolutely rapidly. \" She"], [85, "KITTY'S VICTIM 81 insisted on speaking to you herself. John, my dear old friend, will you trust her to me ? \" John Faulkner sat in his chair, absolutely petrified with astonishment. For the moment not only his senses, but his very voice seemed to have deserted him. At last he managed to gasp out, with a feeble imbecility not to be described \u2014 \" I \u2014 I \u2014 What do you \u2014 what do you mean, Andrew ? \" \" She has told you, has she not ? You will give her to me, John\u2014 Kitty, my dear little Kitty ! \" The room was going round and round John Faulkner, and he clutched the arms of his chair despairingly. \" His dear little Kitty ! \" Andrew Lindsay, solemn, serious, sedate Andrew Lindsay, talking about a dear little Kitty!

Andrew seemed to be rather disconcerted at his silence, and apparently thought that he disapproved of the unusually informal mode F"], [86, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 82 of his procedure. With a curious struggle for his ordinary ceremonious manner, he said ; \" Perhaps I have not expressed myself just as clearly as I would wish to do. I am here, John, to ask your consent to my making your sister my wife.\" There was no doubt about it. It seemed to John Faulkner that the world had suddenly turned upside down ; but those were unmis takably the words he heard. Kitty and Andrew Lindsay ! Andrew Lindsay, the man of all others to whom he would have wished to see her married, if such a blessed possibility had ever entered his head. Andrew Lindsay in love, and in love with Kitty ! And Kitty \u2014 Kitty in love with Andrew Lindsay ! All his trials and anxieties to end in that ! \" You ! \" he gasped at last. \" You ! \" Then he rose impulsively to his feet. \" My dear fellow, my very dear old fellow, there is no one in the world I would rather \u2014 I had no idea ! I thought \u2014 Andrew, old fellow, we"], [87, "KITTY'S VICTIM 83 must be dreaming. There is surely some mistake ! \" \" Yes, Jackie, there is. I think it's yours.\" It was the merest whisper, tremulous with mirth through all its demureness ; but both men turned in the direction from which it came, as if it had been the report of a cannon. There stood Kitty, with her head hanging down and her cheeks scarlet, and the next instant Andrew Lindsay was standing at her side, with both her hands in his. \" You will give her to me ? \" he said ; and before he could frame an answer, John Faulkner's small remaining quantity of pre sence of mind was reft from him by the astonishing spectacle of Kitty's disappearing in Andrew Lindsay's embrace. \" Kitty.\" Kitty emerged \u2014 partially. \" I'm very sorry, Jack,\" she said, with surpassing meekness. \" I forgot it was quite impossible. Is it quite impossible, Jack ? \" \"Kitty, I \u2014 Kitty, I'm \u2014 I'm utterly as tounded.\""], [88, "84 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS \" Yes, Jack,\" very demurely. \" Kitty, I\u2014 I \" \" Yes, John,\" with an intonation of intelli gent interest. \" Kitty ! \" \" Yes, John Julius,\" with the gravest accent. Then quite suddenly the mischief died out of her face, and the mockery out of her voice, and she ran into her brother's arms. \" Jack ! \" she cried, as she laid a wet cheek on his shoulder. \" Forgive me, my dear old Jack. I'll never be naughty again. I couldn't, you know,\" with a pretty imitation of Andrew Lindsay's soft Scotch speech. \" Oh, I am happy, I am happy, dear. Oh, Jack, how can he care for such a little wicked thing as I am?\" \" But what about \" \" It's all right, Jack. Truly it is.\" And apparently it was, though it was some time before John Faulkner could believe it. Norman Lindsay's sufferings were so slight as to be hardly perceptible after the first shock of surprise. He was not of a constant"], [89, "KITTY'S VICTIM 85 turn of mind, and he and Kitty had evidently understood one another's ways very well indeed. John Faulkner wondered, for some time, what Andrew Lindsay had thought of the proceedings from which he himself had suffered so acutely.

The first state- ment had been made by a young man. He was four-and-twenty years old ; he had a good-looking face, in which boyishness strug- gled curiously with a certain air of society and knowledge of the world, and his name was Richard Sylvester. Opposite him sat a girl. Her face, as she lifted it to respond to the young man, was lovely : very delicate in out line and colouring, with large dark-blue eyes, and framed in soft gold hair. She was very"], [94, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 90 daintily and fashionably dressed for travel ling ; but there was something not simply conventional about her personality, and she was by no means as typical as the absolute correctness of her accessories should have made her.

She answered with a very sweet little laugh. \" When you think how much I've got to learn and to do,\" she said merrily, \" it's just as well, isn't it ? \" The past two months had been for Christine Sylvester a wonderful and delightful period of transition. Three months before her world had been an area of Yorkshire moor, peopled, as far as her equals were concerned, by her"], [95, "OUT OF THE FASHION 91 father, her governess, and a certain dull and worthy Yorkshire squire and his wife, who owned the nearest \" place.\" With these good people Christine had chanced to be staying when a nephew of theirs, from whom a duty visit had become incumbent, and whose private groans over the tedium involved were apt to be long and loud, had obtained leave to bring a friend for the hunting, and had introduced the said friend in the person of Dick Sylvester. The latter had come for a week ; he stayed in the neighbourhood for a month. That month saw the dawn and progress of the old idyll of boy and girl love, and three months later the boy and girl were man and wife. Dick Sylvester was well connected, and, in spite of his youth, he had a position in London society, inherited from his father, who had been a man about town in the best \"sets\" for the last five-and-twenty years. The twelve months of married life which had preceded the birth of his son and the death of his wife had apparently been merely an interlude in Edmund Sylvester's life. Left"], [96, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 92 alone, he had returned to bachelor habits, handing over his little boy to be brought up with some aristocratic cousins. Dick's temperament had adapted itself admirably to the education provided for him. No origin ality, no superabundance of brains, rendered it difficult to him to accommodate himself to a narrow groove. At twenty-two interest obtained for him a post in the War Office, and his first twelve months of London life left him a very popular and orthodox speci men of his class ; good-natured and pleasant, but with no conception beyond his own social horizon, and with no higher ideal than to be exactly like ninety-nine out of every hundred men he met in society. It was not exactly an orthodox proceeding to marry a pretty country girl. There were sundry girls in town \u2014 nice, attractive girls, all turned out of one mould \u2014 any one of whom would have been much more \" the thing \" ; and Dick Sylvester's boyish conven tionality had been a good deal perturbed by the untoward action of his heart. But after"], [97, "OUT OF THE FASHION 93 all, he told himself, it was only \" the look of it.\" Christine was not in the least the ordin ary country girl. And he was right. Christine was entirely unconscious that all life was not as her life. She had read no novels ; newspapers she considered dull, and never looked at ; and such hazy impressions of other lives as she had received were coloured by the atmosphere in which her own was lived. But even had she been conscious of her own limitations from a social point of view, there was that about her which would have rendered it im possible for even such consciousness to make her either awkward or uncertain. During the six weeks of her honeymoon, as she travelled about the Continent with Dick, and life unfolded before her eyes, she was like a child waking to a realization of fairyland. She was never oppressed, or con fused by the gulf which lay for her between the present and the past. She was never at a loss or ill-at-ease on the one or two occasions when they chanced to fall in with persons"], [98, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 94 who were to belong to her new life. And the source of her ready adaptation of herself to her new circumstances lay, not in her natural grace or the refinement of all her instincts ; it lay deeper than either of these character istics \u2014 in the fresh, finely-tempered happy spirit which was the mainspring of her dainty little personality. And now the honeymoon was over and she was going home with her husband \u2014 going to a life which existed in her mind only as a brilliant outline, which was to be entirely unlike anything she had ever experienced. The Sylvesters were fairly well off. Dick had taken a smart little flat, and Christine's first season was likely to be a gay one. Her bright words as to her own deficiencies were replied to now by her husband somewhat over-hastily. \" You'll be all right,\" he asseverated ; \"you're sure to be all right! And there's Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe, you know ; she'll put you up to everything.

She did not speak again, but leaned back in her corner and looked vaguely out of the carriage window in a kind of happy dream."], [100, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 96 Dick did not interrupt her. He too leaned back, crossing his legs with a very young man's assumption of elderly nonchalance, and fixed his eyes with a boyish frown of cogita tion on the lovely face in front of him. He was wondering anxiously how his wife would \" do,\" as he phrased it. He loved her after his limited fashion \u2014 that is to say, he admired her beauty immensely, and was very proud of his possession of it ; but now, when his life as a married man was practically to begin, the one all-important point in his mind was that, having taken to himself a wife not of his set, no difference should be perceptible between that wife and the class of woman of which she was now to become, in outward circumstances, one. He thought, as he watched her now, of her pretty manner, her readiness, of what he called her \" natural dash \" \u2014 in reality, her spirit and brightness \u2014 and he smiled to himself a smile of boyish pride. Then another thought seemed to strike him, for the smile faded and the frown re-appeared. He glanced down at a book"], [101, "OUT OF THE FASHION 97 which lay on the seat beside Christine. It was bound according to the latest eccentricity in binding for novels, but she had laid it down some time ago, and only about half was cut open. It bore upon its back the title A Society Phaedra. \" Christie,\" he said, abruptly, \" don't you care for your book ? \" Christine started, and a little additional flush of colour came into her cheeks. \" It was sweet of you to get it for me, Dick, dear,\" she said, hesitatingly ; \"but I'm afraid \u2014I don't.\" To his intense disgust Dick felt his own countenance getting hot, and he answered reprovingly ; \" I think you ought to finish it, though. Everybody in town is sure to be talking about it. They say it's awfully clever.\" \" You \u2014 you haven't read it, Dick ? \" \" Of course I haven't. I gave it to you first.

The train steamed into Charing Cross G"], [102, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 98 Station as he spoke, and lofty superiority was not a mood to last, under the circum stances. To be twenty-four years old, and to be bringing a charming young wife to a perfectly appointed little home, is more com patible with boyish exhilaration ; and during the next three hours there was not a better satisfied young man in London than Dick Sylvester. It was about five minutes to eight when the young husband and wife stood together in their pretty drawing-room, waiting to receive their first guest. A shade of perturbation, as though the impending occasion was a very serious one in his eyes, had settled over Dick's face, and he glanced nervously at Christine as she moved about the room. She was wearing a dainty white tea-gown, bought in Paris ; Dick having assured her that she had \" no proper frocks for the evening.\" She was quite unconscious that she ought to be look- ing forward to an ordeal, and her face was all bright anticipation. \" There she is ! \" said Dick hastily, as the"], [103, "OUT OF THE FASHION 99 door-bell rang ; and then she came across the room and stood by her husband's side, as Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe was announced. Social prominence is no more to be obtained than sundry kinds of prominence better worth having, without a certain allowance of brain power ; and for the last four or five years Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe had been an increasingly pro minent figure in London society. She had been born into a \" good set \" ; she had married in that set, and she might have died in that set without making any particular mark in it. But there was a touch of originality about her, and it took the only line open to her under the circumstances. She went vigorously with the times \u2014 rather ahead of the times, some people said. She was a blonde woman of about five and-thirty, not handsome, but with a style about her which went a great deal further than beauty. She was in full evening dress now, with bare arms, and diamonds flashing at her throat and in her elaborately dressed hair. To a girl, who had never in her life beheld"], [104, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 100 such a figure, she was like a beautiful per sonification of all the novelty to come. But no astonishment or admiration could disturb the happy serenity of Christine's manner, and her acknowledgment of her husband's intro duction was as perfect as years of London life could have made it. \" I'm very glad to meet Dick's wife,\" said Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe graciously, as she held the girl's hand, and looked down at her with keen eyes that took in every detail of form and expression. \" Dick,\" she added, without interrupting her scrutiny, \" mind, it's your wife's acquaintance I've come to make, and don't dare to interrupt us after dinner. I'm going on to a big affair at Lady Heworth's, so I shan't have very long.\" \" It's awfully good of you to come to us,\" said Dick, and as Christine echoed him prettily, Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe laughed, and began to question them, with easy familiarity, about their journey. She was a woman who liked to have about her young men towards whom she held the"], [105, "OUT OF THE FASHION 101 positions at once of confidante and autocrat, and Dick Sylvester had been a great favourite of hers during the past two years.

In the first place, she liked managing other people's affairs ; in the second place, the \" set,\" of which she was the acknowledged leader, was by no means so large or so firmly established as to be independent of recruits. She talked on through dinner pleasantly and cleverly, watching Christine keenly, and now and then slipping in a leading question cleverly veiled.

Her patronage was kindly enough ; Christine pleased her. And her new protegee had found her charming, and had accepted her gratefully as her pilot on the enchanting voyage before her, long before they were interrupted. They had been alone for about half-an-hour when the door was opened, and the maid announced, \" Mr. Sylvester.\" \" Oh ! \" exclaimed Christine, as she went forward to receive the new-comer, \" Dick will be so pleased.\" There was a touch of deference in her manner which made it irresistibly charming, and the man to whom she had given her hand, rather shyly, held it for an instant"], [108, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 104 as he looked at her and said, with a slight smile ; \" I hope you are not displeased.\" Then, on her quick disclaimer, he released her hand and went up to Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe. \" Am I interrupting ? \" he said to her as he shook hands. Edmund Sylvester, Dick's father, was a tall man, with an indolent carriage and an indolent manner. He wore a long grey moustache, and his hair was nearly white at the temples. His face should have been very handsome, but for its remarkable quiescence and the sleepiness of the blue eyes. It conveyed no impression so strongly as that of the entire indifference of its owner \u2014 an indifference apparently so confirmed that his individual character had become lost in it. His question to Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe was spoken with the slightest touch of meaning, of lazily amused comprehension ; and she answered him with a look of daring, half-laughing assent, and defiance. \" You would have interrupted very much a"], [109, "OUT OF THE FASHION 105 little sooner,\" she said. \" Now I think we may forgive you. Christine and I are great friends, and I am just going.\" She rose as she spoke, and Dick entering at the same moment, a little stir of departure ensued. She was just leaving the room ; Edmund Sylvester was holding the door open ; Dick was waiting to attend her down-stairs, and Christine was standing in the middle of the room watching her out, when she turned suddenly. \" By the bye, Christine,\" she said, \" you must finish A Society Phaedra. You'll meet the author everywhere.\" With a curious simultaneous movement both men turned towards the white, girlish figure in the middle of the room \u2014 her husband with a frown of anticipated vexation, his father with indolent curiosity. They saw the happy face curve into fresh smiles of ready assent, the colour changing not at all, the pretty eyes looking frankly into the woman's hard ones. \" Of course I will,\" answered the girl, brightly and eagerly. \" I shall like it, I'm sure.\""], [110, "106 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS \"She's quick,\" said Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe to herself as Christine's young husband put her into her brougham, \" she's very quick indeed ! \" \" I knew she'd be all right,\" Dick thought to himself exultantly \u2014 and untruthfully \u2014 at the same moment. And upstairs in the drawing-room Edmund Sylvester, as he listened to a delicate little expression of Christine's admiration for her new friend, was saying indolently to himself, \" Poor little girl ! \" II.

This was precisely the condition under which Christine Sylvester was embarking on her life in society. The mental comments evoked by her answer to Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's final injunction as to A Society Phaedra, originated, except in one instance, in miscon ception as total as it was inevitable. In Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's meaning of the word, Christine was not \" quick \" ; in her husband's sense of the words, she was by no means \" all right.\" But the distance that separated the girl from the woman of the world, and from the boy who had known no higher type of woman than that woman of the world, was so immea surable that neither party was conscious, even, that any appreciable distance existed. Christine was absolutely innocent in spirit. Of evil in its darkest lines she knew only as of something infinitely terrible and far away ; something utterly outside the sphere of life into which she had been born ; something with which nobody in that sphere could ever"], [112, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 108 come in contact \u2014 unless with a terrific and unnatural convulsion they broke away for ever and became \" bad.\" It is not difficult to account for her ignorance ; she was one of those naturally white souls from which all evil \u2014 unless it is crushed in \u2014 slips away ; she had lived a simple life, into which no actual experience of evil had entered ; in which it was not the custom to discuss the latest society scandal, in public or in private ; or to be witty at the expense of confusion between the tragedy and the farce of domestic life. But her innocent conception of life was the result of no intention on the part of her childhood's guardians, and so difficult is it for knowledge to realize ignorance, that it occurred to no one that she needed any enlightenment on her marriage as to the world into which she was going. She went away with her husband in as dangerous a case as a child setting sail in a boat ignorant of the instability of water ; and no one knew of her danger.

Becoming hazily aware of the incompleteness of Christine's education, he made sundry attempts at improving her \u2014 attempts which he found himself entirely unable to carry through. \" She's so awfully stupid ! \" he would say to himself impatiently. \" It's no use to say any thing to her ! \" Which was not, however, the reason why he never did say anything to her ! Her introduction to A Society Phaedra had been a piece of diplomatic compromise on Dick's part. The book was the work of a"], [114, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 110 man of brains who united novel-writing with society life ; who was considered a master of the so-called intellectual and witty dialects of the day ; and whose reputation as something of a genius allowed him to indulge \u2014 in his books \u2014 in a conspicuous directness of speech and latitude of idea. A Society Phaedra was a very pronounced specimen of his style, and little as Christine understood of it, it stirred in her an instinctive shrinking and repug nance. The signs of her incapacity for ap preciating what \" everybody \" admired had been most disquieting to her husband, and the improvement apparently effected in her by one evening of Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's society had naturally pleased him proportionately. But, as a matter of fact, Christine, on Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's injunction to her to read the book, had simply taken it for granted that she herself had made a mistake about it. She had \"not understood it,\" she told herself; Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe had read it, and she would certainly know if it were \" not nice,\" and would as certainly not wish her to read it."], [115, "OUT OF THE FASHION 111 Christine was entering upon her new life with one mental premise \u2014 everything would be strange to her.

That her new mentor was not wholly to be trusted ; that many of her \" ways \" were merely the daring experiments of a restless brain, and that not even all the women of her own world were altogether as she was ; that she herself would have stopped short of carrying many of her acts and words to a consistent conclusion ; of these facts Christine was wholly ignorant. She only knew that Dick admired Mrs. Kenyon- Stowe very much ; that all the women he"], [116, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 112 admired were like her ; and that it would certainly please him if she did as they did. So she set to work to do as they did, working her way by a chart from which her ignorance eliminated all danger signals and border-lands. The season was a very gay one, and her first half-dozen parties established her as one of its features \u2014 a position which, all-unconscious as she was, gave to the gaiety and excitement of her new life a touch which made it absolutely enchanting. Her success was a foregone conclusion. She was so lovely, she was so bright ; above all, there was that about her which some people call originality, some chic, and which gave her a crowning charm. That something was her perfect innocence, but as such it necessarily passed utterly unrecognized. It was impossible that any of the men with whom she flirted, any of the women in whose gossip she shared, should understand that she spoke the dialect she had acquired so quickly and happily, with no faintest notion of its true significance ; that"], [117, "OUT OF THE FASHION 113 when she used their words and phrases, and laughed at their jokes, she did so as a child might \u2014 in ignorance of the key that gave them meaning. Before the season was half over she was beginning to be spoken of as \" that pretty, fast little Mrs. Sylvester ! \" It was inevitable. She had set out upon the path indicated to her by Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe with no faintest conception whither that path led ; with no conception, consequently, of the fact that there were sundry points, varying according to individual opinion, at which it was desir able to stop. There was one pair of eyes that watched her progress along that path, at first with an indolent interest which was half kindly and half amused, and then with something deeper. Edmund Sylvester was a man who laid claim for himself to nothing but neutrality in all the relations of life \u2014 neutrality which was founded on the careless cynicism of indif ference. He had held lazily aloof from the new \" set \" into which Dick had followed H"], [118, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 114 Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe ; and people who dis approved of it claimed him as an ally. But he never substantiated the claim, if he never repudiated it ; and he had made no attempt to influence his son in the matter, either before or after his marriage. He had apparently been prepared to watch the course of events, and to derive indolent amusement from their progress. As he saw more of Christine, however, his mental attitude altered strangely. Her man ner to Dick's father was one of the few points about her with which none of her new acquaintances could find fault. Whether she met him in society, or received him in his son's house, it was always marked by a pretty touch of deference, and by a certain innocent confidence in him. And as there thickened round her name rumours with which that manner harmonized so ill, he found himself studying her gently, curi ously, and with perception not exercised for years. \" Hallo, Sylvester ! Looking out for this"], [119, "OUT OF THE FASHION 115 pretty daughter-in-law I hear so much about ? \" A large ball was in full swing in a large house in Grosvenor Square, and Edmund Syl vester, to whom the words were addressed, was standing just inside the ball-room door, evidently waiting. He turned at the words, uttered in a rather metallic voice which struck clearly through the dance music and chatter, and confronted a man of about forty, with an ugly, clever face. \" Hallo, Challinor ! Where have you been ? Writing another book for us ? \" he responded indolently. Marcus Challinor was the author of A Society Phaedra. For reasons best known to himself, and not unconnected with his appre ciation of the advertisement involved in the conjectures to which the proceeding gave rise, he had disappeared at the beginning of the season, to re-appear as erratically on the present occasion. He shrugged his shoulders. \" Perhaps,\" he said laconically. \" But I say, Sylvester, this daughter-in-law ! I hear she's"], [120, "116 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS the thing \u2014 doesn't mind what she says or does. Did you hear what she said to Lancaster last night ? \" Edmund Sylvester was looking away over the heads of the dancers. \" No,\" he replied quietly. Then he glanced at the other man. \"Is Lancaster sure that she understood what she was talking about ? \" he said. The author of A Society Phaedra broke into a short laugh. \" My dear fellow \u2014 \" he began, and then he broke off suddenly. \" Good heavens ! \" he exclaimed, \" that's daring ! Look ! \" He looked himself at Sylvester as he spoke, and finished abruptly \u2014 \" That's not your daughter in-law, Sylvester ? \" \" Yes,\" was the leisurely answer. \" Excuse me, Challinor,\" and Sylvester walked away towards the figure which had arrested Chal linor's attention. Challinor's were not the only eyes fixed upon Christine as she entered the ball-room, followed by Dick ; and her appearance and its effect were symbolic of many things. Until"], [121, "OUT OF THE FASHION 117 she came to London, Christine had never worn full evening dress ; she had never un- covered her pretty person in public. Finding this the custom in London, she had accom- modated herself to circumstances, not without considerable internal shyness at first ; and in doing so she had failed to realize that here, as in many other cases, social law draws an arbitrary line. It had never occurred to her that, given it was \"nice\" for a woman to uncover her person at all, that niceness was to be affected by an inch or two more or less. Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe affected a dtcolleti style. Christine submitted to Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's dressmaker's dictation, and was more decol- lete* still. The gorgeous white silk she wore to-night was only an example of a principle carried to its extreme, but hardly a woman in the room looked at it without condemning it. And its wearer was absolutely unconscious. She was looking perfectly lovely and radiantly happy, and her loveliness was heightened by the smile with which she welcomed Edmund Sylvester."], [122, "118 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS \" How full the room is,\" she said, \" and I've promised dozens of dances ! Oh no, not to Dick,\" replying to the suggestion with a little laugh ; \"dozens of men own them, I think.\" \" Dick has no objection ? \" inquired Dick's father, with indolent pleasantness, glancing at his son. \" Dick isn't consulted,\" returned young Syl vester with a laugh. \" When one's wife is such an out-and-out success, you know, one mustn't expect a look-in.\" His voice, his laugh, and his expression as he looked at his wife, all asserted unmitigated pride and satisfaction ; perhaps their assertion was rather too demonstrative, for there was a curious, faint shadow about his elation as of perplexity and vague discomfort. LI is father looked from him back at Christine, and as she looked up into the impassive face, she asked gaily ; \" How do you like my dress ? Isn't it per fect ? \" \" It's very pretty,\" was the quiet response, as Edmund Sylvester glanced again at his son."], [123, "OUT OF THE FASHION 119 And before Christine could speak again, a voice at her elbow said coldly \u2014 \" Mrs. Sylvester, Mr. Challinor wishes to be introduced to you.\" The speaker was a daughter of the house, and Marcus Challinor stood close beside her. The girl performed the little ceremony in the briefest possible terms, without looking at Christine, and turned away quickly, as the latter said brightly ; \" I'm so glad to meet you, Mr. Challinor. I've heard of you incessantly, and of course I've read your book.\" III. \" My dear Mr. Sylvester, she takes my breath away ! I am asked in March, by our poor dear Dick, to keep a little country girl from making herself ridiculous, and in June that little girl is quite capable of giving me points."], [124, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 120 I'm really becoming quite curious to see where she proposes to draw the line.\" It was a lovely Saturday in June, and Sandown Park was looking its very brightest. The lawn was a constantly shifting kaleido scope of gay colour, as the smartly-dressed women with which it was covered strolled up and down. Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe, by whom the above words were uttered, in a half laughing, half-sarcastic tone, as a kind of finale to the conversation which had preceded them, was making one of the crowd with Edmund Sylvester as her escort. The subject which they had been discussing, or rather on which Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe had been delivering a monologue, was one which nearly every other group on the lawn had touched upon, or would touch upon in the course of the day \u2014 Mrs. Dick Sylvester's flirtation with Marcus Challinor. Since the night of his introduction to her, now three weeks since, Marcus Challinor had concentrated himself exclusively on cultivating \" the most original woman in London,\" as he called Christine. Her beauty charmed him ;"], [125, "OUT OF THE FASHION 121 what seemed to him the reckless daring of her sayings and doings, to which, clever man as he was, he never saw the key, fascinated him. On that first evening he had engrossed her completely, and Dick, as he drove home with his wife, had been at some pains to demonstrate to her that it was no small honour to be engrossed by such a lion as Challinor. Christine, in her innocence, detect- ing nothing behind her young husband's expression of triumph in her success, had inferred that it pleased him that Mr. Challinor should talk to her. She had accordingly allowed that gentleman to monopolize her again when next they met, and had been her most charming self to him ; not because she liked him \u2014 as a matter of fact she did not like him \u2014 but because she thought that in so doing she was pleasing Dick. The result was from the first a foregone conclusion. A short pause followed Mrs. Kenyon- Stowe's summary of the position. That lady's sentiments towards Christine had long ceased to be of a cordial nature, and a good"], [126, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 122 deal of feminine spite, mixed with some genuine and surprising disapprobation \u2014 sur prising to Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe herself \u2014 had expressed itself in the course of the last ten minutes. Edmund Sylvester had listened impassively as ever, as he strolled at her side, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes fixed on distance. He did not move them as he said slowly ; \" Would it not be possible for you to warn her ? \" Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe laughed ; it was not a kind laugh. \" Is that an intimation that you consider me responsible for her ? Warn her, my dear Mr. Sylvester ! She knows the ropes quite as well as I do. If you mean that I should warn her as to Marcus Challinor's character, why, she has read his books ! She talks to him about them, by the way \u2014 a thing which I may say, between ourselves, even I should hesitate to do. I'm afraid it is more to the purpose that you should warn Dick.\""], [127, "OUT OF THE FASHION 123 \" I ! \" returned Edmund Sylvester indo lently. \" My dear lady, an interfering father now-a-days is really an anachronism. The boys don't listen.\" Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe's attention was claimed at the moment by some acquaintance, and the conversation ceased ; but \u2014 perhaps because his curiously non-paternal attitude towards his son's establishment was so characteristic of his general indifference, and so thoroughly taken for granted by his friends \u2014 it was by no means the last expression of opinion as to his daughter-in-law's demeanour bestowed upon Edmund Sylvester that day. Dick and Christine had come down to Sandown on a drag. One of the party to which they belonged was Challinor ; he had been at Christine's side throughout the day, and Dick had been very little seen with them. Every one had something to say about Christine \u2014 something cruel, careless, lightly insolent, or gravely condemnatory. Edmund Sylvester had just been listening calmly to an harangue of the latter character"], [128, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 124 delivered by Dick's aunt, Lady Stanton \u2014 a woman belonging to the best type of fashion- able women, and voted by Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe and her set \" slow \" \u2014 when on making his way to the drag on which he was to return to town with Dick and his wife, he came upon the former leaning against a paling watching the putting-to of the horses, with a strangely grave and perturbed expression on his young face. Dick started, and tried with a curiously pathetic effort to regain his usual expression, as he commented carelessly on the scene before them. His father watched him for a moment, and then said quietly ; \" Anything wrong, Dick ? \" Dick started again and coloured furiously. \" Nothing in the world, sir,\" he said boisterously. \"I \u2014 I've dropped a little money.\" Bat it should have taken heavy losses to produce the silence and heaviness of spirit which seemed to weigh upon Dick, not only during the drive home \u2014 during which Christine, bright, happy, and absolutely"], [129, "OUT OF THE FASHION 125 unconscious, monopolized the attention of all the men on the drag \u2014 but during the quiet dinner that ensued. Edmund Sylvester was dining alone with Dick and his wife, and he and Dick were going afterwards to a smoking concert, while Christine went to a dance, from which Dick was to fetch her. She was ready dressed, and stood in the drawing-room buttoning her gloves, when Edmund Sylvester, who had spent an absolutely silent half-hour with his son after dinner, came to say good-night to her. \" I hope you will enjoy yourself! \" he said, looking down at the lovely head bent over the little white glove. \" Christine \" He stopped abruptly. His voice had been very odd and unlike itself, and she lifted her head, and turned her innocent eyes upon his, half wonderingly. He met them, and looked into them with a strange breaking up of the quiescence of his face, and as he did so, the purpose with which he had begun to speak, whatever it had been, failed him gradually and utterly."], [130, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 126 \" Yes,\" she said. \" You always do enjoy yourself ; you are always happy, are you not ? \" he said gently. Quick to feel any gentle influence, she responded to his mood instantly. \" Yes,\" she said softly, \" I am very happy. Dick has given me such a happy life. I often think,\" \u2014 she hesitated, and laid one hand gently on his \u2014 \" I often think about Dick's mother, and how she must have been as happy as I am. And I am always so sorry.\" The words came very low and tremulous, as though her sympathy made her half afraid to intrude upon what, for most of Edmund Sylvester's friends, was a mere episode of the past. But perhaps her instinct was the truer ; for the man who had never been seen since his re-appearance in the world otherwise than indolent and imperturbable, dropped the little hand abruptly, as a curious spasm of pain passed across his face, and went hurriedly out of the room. \" Happy ! \" he said to himself, as he stood"], [131, "OUT OF THE FASHION 127 for a moment in the dimly-lighted hall. \" Happy ! Yes, she was happy ! We were both happy \u2014 once ! \" He paused ; his face began to settle into its usual lines again \u2014 its usual lines infinitely softened. \" Poor little girl,\" he said to himself, \" is it possible \u2014 is it possible ? \" The dance to which Christine was going was a very smart one, and it and the smoking concert to which Dick and his father were going, fairly divided the men of all the best sets between them. Nobody was surprised that Marcus Challinor elected to honour the dance with his presence ; but it did create a good deal of comment that, during the early part of the night, he took no notice whatever of Mrs. Dick Sylvester, but devoted himself to the many women who read his books, were proud of his attentions, and were always ready to spice a feminine conclave with dis cussion of his vices. Christine was quite unconscious of his neglect, as such. She was well pleased to be free for once from the necessity of talking to"], [132, "128 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS Mr. Challinor \u2014 a necessity which never gave her pleasure. She proceeded to avail her self of her freedom in all lightness of heart ; and Marcus Challinor would have been considerably surprised if he could have known how absolutely genuine was her easy reception of him when, late in the proceedings, he came up to her. \" I've not been able to get near you all night,\" he said. \" Why have you been so unkind, Mrs. Sylvester?\" \" Unkind ? \" said Christine consideringly, as she let him take her fan and begin to fan her\u2014 she had been dancing ; \" I don't think so, Mr. Challinor.\" She laughed lightly. \" I thought you wanted to talk to other people.\" Her meaning was absolutely simple, but he thought she was piqued \u2014 as he had intended she should be. He shut the fan suddenly. \" Do you know it is very late ? \" he said abruptly ; \" I am going to ask you a favour. Will you give me a lift home, if you are think ing of going soon ? \" He was looking at her"], [133, "OUT OF THE FASHION 129 keenly as he spoke, and she met his eyes with the absolute innocence which not only he, but several others watching the two, mistook. \" Of course we will,\" she answered, \" I am only waiting for Dick. He is to fetch me.\" He looked into her face steadily for a moment, and then he said, with a curious accentuation of the always metallic ring in his voice ; \" Didn't that man deliver his message ? \" \" No,\" she answered wonderingly ; \" what message ? \" \"Your husband sent word that you were not to wait for him. He can't get away from the concert.\" \" Really,\" said Christine, \" he must be en joying himself immensely. Well, if my hus band has deserted me, we may as well go, Mr. Challinor.\" She turned away, and swept up to the hostess, a gracious, graceful little figure. A rather singular expression rested for an in stant on Marcus Challinor's face, and then, 1"], [134, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 130 without wishing his hostess good-night, he left the room. \" I've taken the liberty of telling the coach man to drive to my place first,\" he said, when they were settled in the brougham, and driv ing rapidly through the streets. He spoke nonchalantly, but again with that unusual tension of tone. \"You wanted to see those Turkish hangings of mine, you remember, and I thought this would be a good oppor tunity.\" He was not looking at her, but out of the carriage window, and his manner seemed to Christine absolutely careless. She paused a moment. The proposed proceeding was no more extraordinary to her than many another in which she had been expected to take part since her arrival in London. No thought of distrust in connection with the man by her side had any place in her innocent mind. But she would rather have gone straight home. \" I don't know,\" she began, \" I am rather \u2014 \" \" Here we are,\" interrupted Challinor, al most harshly."], [135, "OUT OF THE FASHION 131 He got out, and, thinking she had perhaps been rude, she let him hand her out after him. Three minutes later he opened the door of a luxurious bachelor's sitting-room, and as she passed in he followed her, shutting the door after him. \" There,\" he said, facing her with a smile which seemed to Christine to make him curiously uglier even than she had thought him. \" What a pretty room ! \" she said. \" Oh, are those the hangings ? How lovely ! \" He laughed \u2014 a harsh, half-sneering laugh. \" I don't think we need trouble about the hangings ! \" he said. \" Christine \" He stopped. At the first sound of his voice Christine had raised and half turned her head, as she stood with her back to him, and on the other side of the room, examining the Turkish work with which the wall was draped.

They con fronted each other for a moment, and the innocent young face gradually paled as though before some subtly-felt influence from the man's face \u2014 an evil reflection of the evil passions behind it. Then Marcus Challinor's expression changed. The passion subsided temporarily before a sneering cynicism. \" It's part of the comedy, I suppose,\" he said, with a laugh. \" I thought you were less commonplace, Christine. Come, do you want me to play the whole scene through ? This is the kind of thing, isn't it ? Mrs. Sylvester, you don't know why I've brought you here to-night ! You don't know \u2014 how can I tell you ? \u2014 how I love you ! \" He made a step towards her as he spoke with a burlesque flourish, which ended in another cynical laugh. Christine did not move. Only as if each word he spoke, or perhaps the tone in which he spoke them, revealed to her bodily eyes"], [137, "OUT OF THE FASHION 133 some infinitely terrible sight, which she saw but hardly understood, the lovely young face grew bloodless and haggard ; the innocent eyes stared at him from under the drawn brows with an expression which was too utterly horror-stricken for fear. At his last words, the hand which had grasped the Turkish stuffs behind her came out slowly and mechanically, and clasped its fellow on her breast. Marcus Challinor looked at her for a moment, and was conscious of an incom- prehensible misgiving. It made him irrit- able. He walked across the room, and took up his position in front of the empty grate. \" Come,\" he said, \" don't let us be absurd, Christine ! Of course, you know very well that I love you, and I conclude that you are willing to be loved, or you would not be here now.\" He paused, but Christine made him no answer. She only looked at him with those ghastly eyes, and his irritation increased. \" Confound it all ! \" he said. \" Don't look"], [138, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 134 like that at me. What do you mean ? It's a little late \" He was interrupted. With no preliminary warning, without even the sound of a footfall on the stairs, the door of the room opened suddenly, and Edmund Sylvester stood on the threshold. As she saw him, with a feeble movement of her clasped hands towards him, Christine took two or three uncertain steps and fell on the floor at his feet. There was a dead silence. Marcus Chal linor stood just where the opening of the door had arrested him, his face set and livid, his eyes fixed full on Sylvester's as the latter, with all the indifference gone from him at last, his face stern and rigid, his eyes flashing, confronted him from the doorway. Between them lay Christine, covered from her throat to her feet in her long white cloak, her white, unconscious face upturned ; and the two men stared into one another's eyes with an absolute ignoring of her physical condition, about which there was something terrible. \" Do you understand what you have done ? \""], [139, "OUT OF THE FASHION 135 The words came from Edmund Sylvester at last, low and tense, and in their very baldness they suggested depths which no torrent of invective could have touched. White to the very lips, Challinor answered him hurriedly, and in a low, thick voice ; \" I've done nothing ! What do you mean ? She \u2014 \" He stopped, and suddenly, with a simultaneous impulse, both men looked down at the white face at their feet\u2014 the white face and the entreating hands, dumbly appealing to something beyond them. But even then they made no attempt to help her. Challinor broke into speech again harshly. It was curious that the practical consequences of the situation seemed to have no hold on him. He was absorbed to the exclusion of such thoughts. \" What does it mean ? \" he said ; and the fierce demand seemed hardly to be addressed to Edmund Sylvester. \" She under stood well enough. She \" Edmund Sylvester interrupted him. He lifted his eyes from the innocent white face, and fixed them once more on Challinor."], [140, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 136 \" She understood nothing,\" he said slowly. \" She never has understood. Do you try and understand that ! \" Slowly, as if under the influence of some strange fascination, Marcus Challinor in his turn raised his eyes, fierce, incredulous and yet with something in them that was curiously like awe, and met Sylvester's. For another moment the two men con fronted each other thus, and then, without another word, Edmund Sylvester stooped, lifted Christine gently and reverently in his arms, and carried her away. The cool night air revived her a little, only to make her moan faintly, and shrink away into a corner of the brougham. There was the same pitiful, humiliated shrinking when Sylvester half lifted her out, and once within doors, she passed along the passage to her room without a word or a glance, and with a look about her whole slight form, from the bowed head to the faltering feet, as of one stricken. There was the same stricken look about her white, exhausted face when"], [141, "OUT OF THE FASHION 137 she lifted it an hour later to meet her husband. An exclamation of surprise broke from Dick on seeing her still dressed \u2014 still, indeed, in the long white cloak. Then he saw her face, and another exclamation came from him. \"Christie!\" he said hoarsely. \"Christie, what is it?\" What she answered him, how she put into words the horror at which her innocent eyes had looked that night for the first time ; what she told him, and what he supplied for him self, neither of them ever knew. But she was weeping her heart out on his shoulder at last ; weeping out all her agony of realization, all her vicarious sense of unutterable degradation ; and he, with a new manliness, a new individu ality in his boyish face, was trying, incoherently enough, to console her. \" We'll go away, Christie,\" he said eagerly. \" I've come to loathe the whole thing lately."], [142, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 138 Somehow I never thought about it until I saw you in it all, and saw you \u2014 getting like all the others, don't you know.

But the truth was that the innocence and purity of spirit of which he had been boyishly half-ashamed had touched his mental vision almost in spite of himself, and had revealed to him a womanhood of which he had had no previous conception. To his own inexpressible perplexity, he had discovered that everything that had hitherto seemed most admirable to him in woman was vaguely distressing to him in Christine ; that the talk of the day from her lips hurt him ; above all, that there was something, some thing which he slowly and painfully learnt to understand as love, which rendered the part"], [143, "OUT OF THE FASHION 139 of unexacting, easy-going, fashionable husband to the success of the season increasingly unbearable to him.

But if she had lost her childhood's innocence \u2014 and it is given to very few to keep it in its perfect beauty for so long as she had kept it \u2014 she had not lost it in vain. Even from the life of Mrs. Kenyon-Stowe, who never knew the truth, who never could have appreciated it, perhaps, Christine did not pass without leaving a trace of her innocent presence, though that trace was imprinted with almost ironical contrariety.

Her activity in that position, and her appreciation of the situation after six months' trial of it, was being set forth by her, now, to her sister-in-law, as it had frequently been set forth before, in terse and decisive but not unmusical speech. \" This is not a neighbourhood,\" she was saying ; \" it's not a ' set ' even !

I detest gossip. Your horrid Mrs. Smithson gave me the piece of information you have repeated two days ago, and it did not interest me in the least \u2014 as I told her.\" Mrs. Haldane hastened to reply depre catingly. \" Of course ! \" she said. \" I knew there must be a mistake somewhere.

Then she raised her head abruptly. \" It's in my room,\" she said. \" I'll get it for you.\" She crossed the room with a quick, characteristic step, but with her hand upon the door she paused. \"Agnes,\" she said brusquely, \"do not tell Mr. Marvin that I did the account for Richard. I don't wish him to know it.\" Nearly ten minutes had passed when she came down again, and as she drew near the drawing-room door the sound of voices\u2014 one of them a man's voice \u2014 was audible.

The same air was perhaps the first characteristic which struck an observer of his handsome features, and in his face it produced an expression of authority and assurance. His eyes were very pleasant, kindly and keen, and absolutely direct in their gaze. If there were lines about his mouth and nose eminently sug gestive of superciliousness and vanity, it needed more penetration than was possessed by the majority of his parishioners to detect them. He was speaking to Mrs. Haldane as Mrs. Cotgreave came in ; and though he deliberately finished his sentence as he rose, his full, mellow, slightly dictatorial voice became a trifle stiff and constrained.

Are the subscriptions coming in well ? \" The Reverend Paul Marvin made a gesture of gratified assent. \" Fairly ! \" he said. \" Yes, fairly.

Its vigorous vivacity disappeared before a certain heavy concentration of thought. Once only was its sombre absorption broken ; and then it was the look of defiance and antaeo nism with which he had met Mrs. Cotgreave's eyes, that leapt up in every feature as his fingers closed like a vice round the account books he carried. Arrived at the rectory, he let himself in and went straight to his study. Two letters, unopened, lay upon his table. He flung him self into his writing-table chair and sat there staring at them. The word of the Reverend Paul Marvin was law to an overwhelming proportion of his parish of twelve hundred odd souls. He had the primary gift of eloquence; he had the power of organization which often goes with a vigorous and restless temperament ; he had a strong and dominating personality. The five years during which he had held his present living had raised him to the position"], [159, "AN UNPRINCIPLED WOMAN 155 of spiritual and social autocrat, adored by the vast majority, respected, and perhaps feared, even by the minority by whom he was not adored. If such a position has its dangers ; if the man who occupies it stands in need of some counteracting influence at once tender and clear-sighted ; it was not in his own home that any such an influence met Paul Marvin. His wife was a querulous, weak-minded woman, wholly incapacitated by hysteria from fulfilling any of the duties of life. Even the care of their two little boys was more than she considered herself equal to; and they had been sent, as little more than babies, to school in the country. Paul Marvin had no domestic life. He lived in public, in the life of the parish. The house was very still. As he sat there looking down on the topmost of the two unopened letters, there was not the faintest sound to be heard.

Then he let his hand fall slowly on to the table, crushing the letter. \" What am I to do ? \" he said in a low voice. Moments passed, and he did not stir.

Mrs. Cotgreave had been dining out ; her brother had waited to receive her, and he was sit ting at the table before a business-like array of papers.

Then he put a sheet of paper into her hand. \" Not particularly interesting to you, I'm afraid ! \" he said. She shook her head, still with that little smile, as she glanced down the paper. Then she lifted her head. \" I thought a balance-sheet represented all the incomings and out-goings for the year ? \" she asked. \" This one only dates from July,\" he answered. \" The fund wasn't opened until then. It represents the out-goings and in comings from July to December.\" Mrs. Cotgreave made no reply. She was studying the paper intently, and the smile had disappeared from her face. \" There are not many people who wish to conceal their good deeds ! \" she said at last ;"], [163, "AN UNPRINCIPLED WOMAN 159 \" only two anonymous subscribers \u2014 one fifty pounds, one ten.

You take the paper, and I'll read out the entries in the book.\" It was not a long task, even though, saying that she had lost the place, she made him go twice through the receipts for November and"], [164, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 160 December. And at the end she pushed her chair back sharply, and stood up. \" You were quite right ! \" she said rapidly. \" No mistake anywhere ! Good - night, Richard ! \" And the next moment she was gone. During the two days that followed, Mrs. Haldane went the length not only of deciding that her sister-in-law \" felt the cold,\" but of further communing with herself as to whether Mrs. Cotgreave were not on the verge of a serious illness. Mrs. Cotgreave's temper and general demeanour were, indeed, such as to require some accounting for. They varied, almost from hour to hour, between such brusqueness as was almost acerbity, and an absent-minded depression in which nothing seemed to interest her. She spent more time than usual in her own room, flatly and fiercely refusing to attend one of the rectory work ing parties, which had hitherto been a source of the greatest entertainment to her. But it was to the rectory, nevertheless, that Mrs. Cotgreave proceeded on the third"], [165, "AN UNPRINCIPLED WOMAN 161 morning. She was looking very pale, even a trifle haggard ; and there was a sunken look, suggestive of want of sleep, about her eyes. Her inquiry for Mr. Marvin received a smiling assent, and she followed the servant across the hall. For an instant, as his eyes fell upon her, a singular flash of expression passed across Paul Marvin's face. Then, without a moment's hesitation, he advanced, holding out his hand. \" Mrs. Cotgreave ! \" he exclaimed. \" This is indeed an unexpected pleasure. Is it possible that I can have the honour of being of any service to you ? \" His tone was rather curious. As though the momentary shock of her appearance had slightly disturbed his balance, its expression seemed to be in abeyance, to await develop ments, as it were.

There ! \" \u2014 as she seated herself mechanically \u2014 \" I flatter myself that is rather a nice chair. Mrs. Haldane is quite well, I hope, and your brother ? Now,\" he said, \" what can I do for you, Mrs. Cotgreave ? \" There was a long pause. Mrs. Cotgreave did not seem to resent his tone ; it seemed,. indeed, to pass her by so entirely, that even the words he spoke hardly penetrated to her brain. She spoke at last in a low, uncertain voice. \" The Philip Allardyces,\" she said, \" are old friends of mine.\""], [167, "AN UNPRINCIPLED WOMAN 163 For one long second the stillness of the room was like the stillness of death. Then Paul Marvin leaned back in his chair, and deliberately crossed his legs. \" Yes ? \" he said. \" Really ! \" Magdalen Cotgreave's whole figure seemed to shrink as with unendurable personal humiliation.

She was looking straight before her ; looking, as it seemed, directly and on self-compulsion at the mental picture his speech \u2014 uttered as he had uttered it \u2014 had conjured up. The whole bald, pitiful story ; the sensitive pride that would brook no exhibition of the seams in its garments ; the personal vanity that would abate no jot of the consideration that seemed its due ; the jealous dignity which writhed at the thought of criticism ; lay bare before her. She saw the long struggle between appearance and reality ; the long, grinding fight ; the slow oncoming of defeat. Paul Marvin did not turn. Even if he had seen her face at that moment, that which was written on it could hardly have been in terpreted by any faculty which he had cultivated.

The faintest shade of pink, the difficult"], [188, "1 84 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS wintry flush of age, stole into the old lady's; cheeks. \" Oh, dear me ! \" she murmured. \" Yes, to be sure. Oh, dear me ! \" \" You would like to come to your room at once, ma'am ? \" said the woman. \" You must feel very tired coming such a long way ! \" But the woman, as she led the way up-stairs,, had no idea what was indeed the distance which the little old lady had traversed that day. In the past twelve hours Miss Keturah Brown had journeyed, figuratively speaking, from one world to another. All the years of Miss Keturah Brown's life had been lived in a remote little country town, where the narrow staidness of the most rigid Calvinism had dominated the very atmosphere. One by one all the members of her family had laid down their quiet, precise lives, and passed away into the quiet, precise churchyard, until Miss Keturah and one brother alone were left. A year before the wet January night that brought the little old lady to London, this brother also had died ; and before Miss"], [189, "MISS KETURAH 185 Keturah had fairly settled down to her lonely life, another \"dispensation,\" as she herself expressed it, fell upon her. She lost all her little property, and found herself prac tically penniless. It was at this juncture that she received a letter, signed \" Diana Forsyth,\" in which the writer, after proving a distant relationship between herself and her corre spondent through a certain renegade offshoot of the Brown family, who had gone to London and devoted himself to art, proceeded to offer the forlorn old lady a home. \" I am a widow,\" the letter said, \" and it seems a pity we shouldn't keep each other company, doesn't it?\" Mrs. Forsyth lived in London, and was vaguely understood to be \"worldly.\" But there was worse even than this : Mrs. Forsyth was an actress. Exactly what the term con veyed to Miss Keturah Brown and her friends it would be difficult to define. But the little old lady's first impulse was one of dismayed refusal. Finally, however, on discovering a subscription on soot among her grim old friends \u2014 none of whom had any money to"], [190, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 1 86 spare \u2014 to save her from the only other alternative which presented itself, the work house, she made up her mind that it was her duty to accept Mrs. Forsyth's offer. Two hours after her agitated arrival in Mrs. Forsyth's house, the old lady, considerably refreshed, physically, by the dainty little meal which had filled her soul with perturbation, was sitting alone in the drawing-room. It was a charming room, a little eccentric in its picturesque arrangement, such a room, in short, as Miss Keturah Brown had never een ; and she surveyed it now and again with much nervous foreboding in her eyes. She had removed all traces of her journey with scrupulous neatness. The short full skirt she wore, now, was of worn black silk, as was the singular little jacket-like bodice. A little white shawl, fine as a cobweb, draped her shoulders, and she wore a white cap, not unlike a muslin nightcap. This was tied under her chin with narrow white ribbon, and from it there floated down on either side of her face lace streamers. Her face, now that rest and quiet had removed its excessive"], [191, "MISS KETURAH 187 agitation, was singularly unwrinkled, withered though it was, and smooth bands of soft grey hair appeared beneath her cap border. Her little old hands, adorned with several mourn ing rings, held a grim-looking volume of sermons. She had emerged from her bed room clasping this volume in her hand, as though it presented itself as some sort of barrier between herself and the unknown by which she was surrounded. By and by, however, the book slipped into her lap, and her head, which had been nodding for some time, fell gently back against her chair. The suggestion offered by the elderly maid, that she would not, of course, wait for Mrs. Forsyth's return, had been scouted by her with gentle dignity. As she herself would have expressed it, she knew what was becoming under the circumstances, and nothing would have induced her to retire for the night until she had made her acknowledgments to her unknown hostess. But she was very tired, nevertheless, and having once succumbed to her drowsiness, she slept soundly. She did"], [192, "1 88 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS not hear the front door open with a latch-key at last, nor did she hear the sound of foot steps ; she did not hear the drawing-room door open, or a man's voice say, \" By Jove ! \" He was a tall, fair man, in evening dress ; he had come into the room with two ladies, and as the trio paused, another step came quickly up the stairs and a third woman appeared \u2014 a woman who looked little more than a girl, with bright auburn hair and laughing grey eyes. She, too, stopped short as she saw Miss Keturah. \" Oh, what a dear little old lady ! \" she ex claimed. Then, with a half-laughing softness on her mobile face, she advanced into the room and Miss Keturah woke. She must have been dazed with sleep still, however, for instead of rising in prim trepida tion to receive her hostess, as she would cer tainly have done had she been herself, she simply sat up and stretched out both her hands towards Mrs. Forsyth. \" Oh, you pretty creature ! \" she said."], [193, "MISS KETURAH 189 II. \"\"But your baptismal name \u2014 I am truly sorry, my dear, to have to say it \u2014 your bap tismal name has such a sadly unchristian sound.\" \" Call me Di, then, my quaint Keturah !

A fortnight had passed since Miss Keturah's arrival in London. The scene was the sunny little room assigned to her for a sitting-room. It was furnished with the quaint old furni ture which had belonged to Miss Keturah's parents, and there was a certain bare and severe neatness about it which is peculiarly charac teristic of the type of character to which Miss Keturah's family had belonged. Every"], [194, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 190 inanimate object in the room was in perfect harmony with Miss Keturah's little old-world figure, as she sat in her arm-chair by the fire. And the only other occupant of the room gave the finishing touch to the picture by adding to it the daring charm of contrast. Mrs. Forsyth was standing by the fire-place leaning one arm on the mantelpiece, and look ing down into Miss Keturah's face with eyes of infinite entertainment and delight. She was dressed in some kind of fresh delicate morning gown of pale green, and her changing, be wildering beauty was modern in every line ; modern, not in any sense of conventionality, but as being instinct with the spirit of the day. \" Conventional,\" indeed, was just the word of all others which it was impossible to think of in connection with Diana Forsyth. She had been erratic, wilful, and enchanting, from her childhood. The renegade Brown had been well treated by the art he had chosen to serve. He had been a successful painter, and his only child, motherless from her birth, had never known an ungratified wish. She had"], [195, "MISS KETURAH 191 married at eighteen \u2014 for a freak, her father declared \u2014 a man much her senior.

She travelled for two years, and then electrified her friends, first by announcing her intention of going on the stage, and then by developing genius in her suddenly adopted profession. Miss Keturah looked up into her face for a moment, with eyes in which bewilderment and fascination were blended with a haunting consciousness of the terrible \" worldliness \" of the woman before her. \" Di ! \" she murmured faintly. \" Oh, dear me ! I don't think \u2014 Di is so \u2014 so \" \"Well, it mustn't be Mrs. Forsyth!\" said the owner of the unchristian name, with pretty imperiousness. \"And Cousin Forsyth is quite paralyzing to think of.\" She let herself sink into the stiff, old arm-chair which faced Miss Keturah, on the other side of the fire, clasping her hands behind her head, as she fixed her eyes again on the little old lady."], [196, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 192 \"Where did you get your own delicious name ? \" she demanded. The amusement in her eyes was so tender as to make her vaguely bewitching to Miss Keturah ; and it was quite an effort to the latter to remember how reprehensible was the ignorance of Scripture displayed in the question. \" My love, you are forgetting,\" she said, with a little assumption of severity, before which the beautiful lips of Diana trembled slightly with laughter; \"we read of Keturah in the Book of Genesis. One of the \u2014 the\u2014 wives of the patriarch Abraham was so called.\" Miss Keturah paused a moment ; her eyes were resting on the lovely womanly figure opposite her, and apparently the sight touched a faint chord in her being, overlaid even in her youth by the atmosphere in which she had lived. Almost as though involuntarily, and with a touch of consciousness which was almost pathetic in the innocent retrospect which it implied, she added ; \" I remember once, when I was a young"], [197, "MISS KETURAH 193 girl, overhearing, inadvertently, a remark of my dear father's, to the effect that he regretted that he had not called me Kerenhappuch.\" \" Kerenhappuch ! \" ejaculated Diana under her breath. Then to her quick sympathy there recurred a vague remembrance of some words she had heard \u2014 when or where she could hardly have said ; those words by which the memory of the daughters of Job is handed down the ages invested with a shadowy fas cination against which time is powerless. Her laughing lips softened as her grey eyes rested on the withered face, which in its age bore a mute witness to the girlish beauty which had faded, untouched by the deepest joys as by the deepest sorrows of life. \" ' In all the world were none so fair ! ' \" Diana quoted, incorrectly, but very softly. As though the words brought her back to herself with a shock, the old lady started violently, and a faint flush stole into her cheeks. \" My dear,\" she said, with fluttered remon strance. \" My dear ! We don't \u2014 it is not N"], [198, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 194 seemly, I think \u2014 I have never considered such matters ! Pray do not ! \" Diana laughed, and a mischievous spirit seemed to come upon her. Shifting her position slightly, she began to shower ques tions upon Miss Keturah. Disconnected, erratic questions they were, about the life which the old lady had left behind her ; and every now and then her low, musical laugh would break out, with a bewitching word which made it almost a caress. At last she rose, reluctantly enough. \" I must go,\" she exclaimed. \" But you must see the world, my quaint Keturah ; my heart is set on showing you the world. Come for a drive with me now, this moment.\" But Miss Keturah excused herself with some agitation. \" My dear, I feel it sadly ungrateful to say no to you in any matter, your kindness is so very great.\" Here Diana interposed with a warning shake of the head, and of a slender threatening finger. \" Yes, my love, you really must let me say so. But as to seeing the"], [199, "MISS KETURAH 195 world, I really don't think\u2014 and I regret to say that as yet I have really sent no detailed com munication to my friends. They will consider me sadly neglectful. And I propose to devote this morning to the accomplishment of that duty.\" But, left to herself, Miss Keturah seemed to find the aforesaid duty a very heavy task. She made her precise little arrangements, took out a half-filled sheet of letter-paper, and took up her pen ; and then she paused. She had already spent more than one unsatisfactory half-hour before that half-finished letter. As a matter of fact, she had reached that point in her correspondence when some detailed description would be expected from her of the worldly woman who was alluded to among the grim, staid, old friends from whom she had parted as her \" connection.\" And this description Miss Keturah sound herself abso lutely incapable of composing. No phrases would occur to her with reference to her reprehensible \"connection,\" but such as were absolutely shocking to her in their tolerance"], [200, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 196 for worldliness, and affection for the worldly minded \u2014 as represented by Diana. She was conscious of a desire \u2014 which amazed as much as it dismayed her \u2014 to palliate all the points of conduct which stamped Mrs. Forsyth as \"a lost sheep,\" and dwelt exclusively upon her charms. \" Such a sweet creature ! \" she murmured vaguely to herself, as she gazed helplessly at her paper. \" Oh, dear me, such a sweet, kind creature ! \" But she was also keenly alive to the horror with which such a communi cation would be received by the worthy lady to whom it was addressed. Finally, Miss Keturah decided that it was the part of a Christian woman to suspend judgment as long as might be. She disposed of the difficult question in a sentence in which she stated her intention of \"extending her observation before committing to paper senti ments which might be considered premature,\" and finished her letter in triumph. Miss Keturah \" extended her observation \" at her leisure as the days rolled into weeks, but sentiments which could be transmitted to"], [201, "MISS KETURAH 197 her friends showed no signs of evolving them selves. The \"unholy love\" for Diana, with which that lost sheep taxed her on one occa sion, with a laugh of infinite enjoyment, developed day by day. Diana never at tempted to conceal her knowledge of the struggle which it created in the little old lady ; on the contrary, she appeared to take a mischievous pleasure in complicating it ; exhibiting herself in her most wayward, capricious, and \" worldly \" moods, and then sweeping away Miss Keturah's horrified pro tests with irresistible fascination. Miss Keturah, though she protested con scientiously, and was \" painfully shocked,\" as she expressed it, again and again, was perfectly powerless to restrain her unruly affection. Her tender interest in \" my dear Diana,\" as she took to calling Mrs Forsyth with much timid hesitation, developed in the little old lady perceptions which she had never exer cised before ; and a short time only had elapsed before that interest was extended to one of Diana's most frequent visitors. This"], [202, "198 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS was the man who had opened the drawing room door on the night of Miss Keturah's arrival; a certain Mr. Aubrey Ireland. There was that about Mr. Aubrey Ireland which induced in Miss Keturah, during the earlier stages of their somewhat perfunctory inter course, a timid awe. \" So \u2014 so \u2014 polished,\" she said to Diana. \" So exceedingly talented ! My love, his conversation makes me feel a little giddy, do you know.\" But this sensation in Miss Keturah was cer tainly produced by no flow of conversation on Mr. Ireland's part. His talents were evinced rather in the man's personality; in his indolent acceptance of the prominence unconsciously and instinctively assigned to him, wherever and whenever he appeared, than in any personal activity. Scarcely a day passed, as it seemed to Miss Keturah, on which he did not visit Diana. When she had other visitors he would make himself lazily agreeable to them ; when he found Miss Keturah and Diana alone together he rarely talked at all, leaving the"], [203, "MISS KETURAH 199 conversation to Diana, who seemed always unusually gay and fanciful on these occasions. \" You have never congratulated me on being no longer alone,\" she said to him with a laugh, as he rose to take leave on one of these occasions. She had drawn Miss Keturah's hand through her arm as she spoke, and she was looking into his impassive face with a laugh in her eyes. Aubrey Ireland looked at her for a moment, in silence. \"Have I not, really?\" he said. \"Ah! allow me to take this opportunity.\" His voice was dry ; \" peculiar,\" Miss Keturah said to herself. It was shortly after this that Miss Keturah matured the great discovery that there could be no manner of doubt but that Mr. Aubrey Ireland was \" greatly attached \" to Diana ; and it was with an exceeding flutter of delighted excitement that she accepted the further conviction that \" dear Diana's heart was not untouched\" by Mr. Aubrey Ireland. Romance and sentiment, frozen into numbness"], [204, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 200 throughout her life, thawed into a fluttering warmth in the simple, old, maiden breast as she watched the \" courtship.\" With tentative, trembling delicacy, she ventured to reveal to Diana what she described as her \" perception of the state of affairs.\" Diana flushed crimson, and gazed at her for a moment with some thing strange in her grey eyes ; then she laughed, musically but no less strangely ; a mood more than usually fanciful seemed to take possession of her, and with soft words and little tender laughs she proceeded to draw the old lady out, wiling her on to clothe in her prim, formal little phrases the innocent romance of her heart. But as the months ran on, and winter and spring gave place to summer, Miss Keturah began to be vaguely troubled. That Diana should be wayward and capricious with her lover seemed to her by no means strange. Coyness indeed, in her eyes, was but seemly. But by degrees she began to think that coy ness might be carried to an excessive extent. Into the \"courtship\" there crept something"], [205, "MISS KETURAH 201 which she could not understand \u2014 an element of which she was vaguely conscious, but which lay beyond the sphere of her innocently sentimental perceptions. Of Mr. Ireland's \" intentions,\" as it seemed to Miss Keturah, there could be no possible doubt, and yet the consummation of the affair lagged. Clearly, therefore, the fault must lie with Diana. Mrs. Forsyth grew fitful and nervous. If Mr. Ireland did not come \u2014 and now and then his absences sent a cold chill through Miss Keturah's heart \u2014 she was restless and de pressed. When he did come, she was fever ishly unlike herself. And she turned abruptly from Miss Keturah's most delicate allusion to the subject. The end of June came. The theatre \u2014 a word which Miss Keturah never heard even from her dear Diana without a shudder \u2014 was to close immediately, and still Mrs. Forsyth had made no plan for leaving town. It was nearly twelve o'clock one night, and Miss Keturah, who always \" retired \" at ten, was lying wakeful with anxiety. During the past"], [206, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 202 day Diana's feverish restlessness had touched such a point as it had never reached before. In the midst of her light, flippant talk, she had alluded carelessly to a fact which Miss Keturah then learnt for the first time ; namely, that Mr. Aubrey Ireland had accepted a diplomatic appointment, and would shortly leave England for Russia. Poor Miss Keturah was unspeakably per turbed at the news. Diana had given her no opportunity for commenting upon it, even if she had felt able to do so ; and she was reviewing the position of affairs, now, in much distress of mind, the little old face bordered by nightcap frills looking particularly small and troubled, when a low knock came at her door. \" Oh, dear me ! Come in,\" she said. And then as the door opened, and a slight white figure came softly into the dimly-lighted room, she said agitatedly ; \" Diana ! My love, I trust there is nothing amiss ? \" Mrs. Forsyth had come quickly up to the bedside and stood looking down at her. She was very pale, and the past few months had"], [207, "MISS KETURAH 203 made her much thinner ; there were heavy shadows round her eyes now, and in the eyes themselves there was a certain look, which Miss Keturah's old eyes could not see, of strain and suffering. \" Nothing, Miss Keturah ! \" she said, \" I only came \u2014 I thought perhaps you might not be asleep, and I thought I should like to say good-night to you. I shan't see you in the morning, you see.\" Her voice was low and not quite like itself. \" Thank you, my love,\" returned Miss Keturah affectionately. \" True ; dear Mrs. Frampton will expect me by eleven o'clock.\" Mrs. Frampton was a connection of one of Miss Keturah's old friends, and a connection, as Miss Keturah had regretfully felt, of whom any one might be proud. \" Most godly people, my love,\" she had assured Diana on more than one occasion. It had been a matter for anxious remorse with her when she realized a growing dis inclination for the society of Mrs. Frampton \u2014 who was indeed a matron of such stony and severe demeanour that her proud con-"], [208, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 204 nections were most likely to rejoice in her at a distance \u2014 and her voice as she spoke was a ludicrous combination of reluctance and self reproach. But Diana did not seem to notice it. She stood quite still, absently stroking one of the withered old hands which lay upon the counterpane, and after a moment's silence, during which Miss Keturah looked anxiously up into her pale face, the little old lady took a desperate resolution. \" Diana, my love,\" she said, in a somewhat quavering voice, \" I cannot fail to see that you are not yourself.\" The movement of Diana's fingers stopped suddenly, and then the auburn head dropped gently down on to the pillow beside Miss Keturah. But Mrs. Forsyth did not speak, and Miss Keturah went on bravely ; \" My love, I would not for a moment intrude upon affairs of the heart, which must ever be sacred, but I feel that a word may be helpful to you. Diana, love, pardon me if I am wrong in believing that you are not dis inclined towards Mr. Aubrey Ireland?\""], [209, "MISS KETURAH 205 There was no answer, only the hand in which Miss Keturah's still rested closed suddenly and involuntarily. \" Then, my dear Diana, I feel that you should bring yourself to confess your attach ment.

Diana softly lifted Miss Keturah's hand and put it to her lips. Then she sprang lightly to her feet and shook back her hair, her eyes shining rather wildly, her cheeks flushed. \" Good-night, my sweet Keturah,\" she said. \" Good-night, my sweet, quaint Keturah ! \" The next moment the door closed behind her. She had not kissed the little old lady. There was no colour in her face when she reached her own room, and it was drawn and haggard.

Her face was very white and set, but over its rigid lines there played a light of wild excitement, which sparkled and shone in her grey eyes, and seemed to battle with a strange, far-away look of tense, reckless anticipation. \" What is it, my quaint Keturah ? \" she said lightly. \" What have the godly been doing to you that you re-appear so early ? \" Miss Keturah had risen on Diana's appear ance, and had taken two little uncertain steps towards her. \" My love ! \" she began, and the quivering of her voice was pitiful to hear ; \" my love, I \u2014 I \u2014 have been exceedingly distressed.\" In the curious excitement which seemed to possess her, Mrs. Forsyth apparently failed to appreciate the words, or the tone in which they were uttered.

Her eyes fell on the little old face, a picture of absolutely blank dismay ; and the drawn lines of her face broke up suddenly in a burst of hysterical laughter.

She paused a moment at the drawing room door ; then she turned the handle and passed in, her quaint little figure very erect, her face a little flushed. Mr. Aubrey Ireland was standing at the farther end of the room, and as the door opened he turned quickly. Seeing Miss Keturah, however, he paused abruptly, for an instant. Then he came forward with rather"], [221, "MISS KETURAH 217 careless courtesy to meet her. His face was pale, and his cold, blue eyes were preoccupied and hungry-looking. \" Good-day ! \" he said nonchalantly. \" Mrs. Forsyth is at home, isn't she ? \" Miss Keturah made him a stiff little curtsey, ignoring his offered hand, and she replied with prim formality ; \" Mrs. Forsyth is at home. She has, however, asked me to represent her in the reception of your visit, and she has charged me with an explanation on her behalf.\" Mr. Aubrey Ireland stared down at the little old lady, who met his eyes with a mild severity. Then he caught his moustache with savage impatience between his teeth. \" Perhaps you will be good enough to explain ? \" he said.

As his eyes fell upon the note his face changed suddenly into hard lines of intense expectancy.

A fierce imprecation broke from him, and Miss Keturah uttered a little cry. Then he con trolled himself into his usual cynical calm.

My answer is \u2014 No, no, no.\" For an instant Aubrey Ireland met her eyes in silence. Then as they still faced each other, his face now as white as hers, he said in a low, hoarse voice ; \" Do you remember that I leave England to-morrow ? \" \" Yes,\" she said. There was a pause.

Then the door closed behind him, they heard his footsteps die away down the stairs, and they heard the street door shut behind him.

Ethel Sedgewick had chosen the dress from her wardrobe as being the least strikingly smart garment she possessed. But she had not allowed for the effect either of novelty or contrast. The vivid colours which were just superseding half tones had not hitherto penetrated to East bury; the skilful mingling in Miss Sedgewick's bodice of vivid green and old lace ; the sweep of the train ; the glitter of diamonds here and there in her rich brown hair ; perhaps, above all, the perfect grace and self-possession of the owner of the whole, took away, for the moment, Eastbury's breath. The effect of the whole being so electrifying, Eastbury could hardly be expected to notice the face, which was, nevertheless, the very centre and"], [234, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 230 soul of the picture. Most of the people present, also, had seen it before, and were inclined to depreciate it. It was considered that the mouth was too large, the nose too turned up. The beauty of the eyes, candid and clear as a child's ; the womanly feeling and thought written in the faint lines about the mobile lips, were full of a charm that was beyond Eastbury. Mrs. Harford had been twice married. Her first husband, Ethel Sedgewick's father, had been a barrister. He had died when his daughter was fourteen, and on her mother's second marriage the girl had been practically adopted by some of her father's old friends. There had been an idea at the outset that her voice might be trained for concert singing, and though this plan had failed to develop, Miss Sedgewick had found no difficulty whatever in making a place for herself in the world.

Miss Sedgewick turned to him with a slight graceful recognition of his courtesy, and then as Ruth said hurriedly, \" Mr. Dawson, my sister ! \" her smile broke out brightly. \" It's too bad to take your place,\" she said. \" Thanks, so much.

A good deal of amusement was the order of the day in Eastbury ; but it went on hand in hand with an extremely practical and un flagging application to business, on the part of the male portion of the prosperous little community. Consequently the round eyes of Mrs. Harford's little maid grew rounder by several degrees, with astonishment, when she answered the door-bell at eleven o'clock the next morning, to find Mr. Robert Dawson on the doorstep.

Even as he shook hands with Mrs. Harford, Robert Dawson's eyes had wandered to the figure on the other side of the table and he had coloured, with shyness apparently, up to his ears. Ethel Sedgewick held out her hand with frank friendliness. \" Have you arranged for that skating expedition? \" she said. \" I didn't know,\" he answered (he stammered a little as he spoke) ; \" I wasn't sure whether you meant it.\" He was shaking hands with Ruth by this time, but he turned to Mrs. Harford as though he found it easier to address himself to her. \" The ice out at Cooper's Edge is first-rate,\" he said, \" and I thought that perhaps \u2014 \" he blundered hope lessly and stuck fast, and Ethel Sedgewick came to the rescue with an instantaneous ease and readiness."], [239, "THE DIFFERENCE 235 \" You skate, don't you, Ruth ? \" she said. \" Mr. Dawson told me so, and I love it.\" \" But can you get away ? \" inquired Mrs. Harford, of Dawson, in mild amazement. \"In the morning, too.

Ethel Sedge wick's cheeks glowed with the air and exercise, and her eyes were dancing.

The doubtful glances cast so often towards Miss Sedgewick, as she sat in judgment while the performance proceeded, were not Ruth's. Ruth, indeed, seemed to be, and was, sure of applause. And it was Dawson who waited at the end for the verdict with a hang-dog expression of utter humiliation. The duologue was a trifle, setting forth an encounter between a dull young man from the country and a mischievous woman of the world. Perhaps it was because the gay humour of the woman's part appealed to her personally ; perhaps it was because Dawson, in his proper person, was so like the part he was representing as to render a fair measure of success possible to the performance, if only Ruth could be brought to any faint notion of"], [242, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 238 what was required of her ; but some cause or other set light to Miss Sedgewick's artistic instinct, and she threw herself enthusiastically into the business of correcting the pair. A little stage management, a few hints as to emphasis, constituted all the interference she dared attempt where Dawson was concerned. She was afraid of spoiling him. But on Ruth she concentrated all her energies. Rehearsals took place every day, and Ethel Sedgewick emphatically, and with laughing eyes, nega tived a suggestion made by her sister to the effect that they took up too much of Mr. Dawson's time, and that Ethel could coach her by herself. But except in this instance, it is possible that Miss Sedgewick, in the artistic interest of her task, allowed her original object in promoting the rehearsals to slip out of her sight. Ruth was merrily lectured, ordered about, moved about, even, like the automaton she was ; sometimes she would be laughingly turned off the improvised stage, and Miss Sedgewick herself would play the scene with Robert Dawson, interpolating"], [243, "THE DIFFERENCE 239 directions and comments to Ruth as she went. So, on the whole, it was not surprising that as the fortnight of Miss Sedgewick's visit wore on, Ruth showed a decided disposition to shirk rehearsals. A certain sulkiness in her demeanour, which had indeed pervaded it ever since that first skating expedition, was rather disappointing to her sister. It was the afternoon of the day preceding that on which Ethel Sedgewick was to return to London, and Ethel herself was kneeling on the worsted-worked fender stool in her mother's drawing-room. She was alone, and as she knelt there in the fire-light her dainty figure stood out in singular relief against the banner screens, florid cretonnes, and cheap knick-knacks of which the decorations of the room were composed.

Then, as Miss Sedgewick spoke, he started painfully, and came awkwardly and hastily up to her. \"Didn't Ruth let you know?\" she said pleasantly. \" No rehearsal ? \" She had not offered him her hand.

Family affairs, connected with the arrival of an unwelcome visitor, seemed to be the topic \u2014 conversation not interesting to an outsider in itself, but rendered piquant by the unrestrained indignation of the high pitched, childish voice. \" Says he wants to make friends with his relations ! \" were the first consecutive words the young man caught. \" What rubbish ! He can't afford to stay at a hotel, I expect. Did I tell you what he said about Christmas ? \" A noisy piece of road rendered her voice inaudible, and when her words again reached"], [258, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 254 the young man's ear she had passed apparently to another branch of the same subject. \" Like ? \" she was saying scornfully. \" Oh yes, I know just what he'll be like ! A senti mental German, don't you know, \u2014 flabby and affectionate.\" She had been noticing the progress of the omnibus as she spoke, and as she laughed indignantly she signalled to the conductor to stop, and got out with a careless nod to the boy. The conductor's eyes suddenly fell on the young man. \" Didn't you say Roland Crescent, sir ? Here you are ! On the left.\" It was not a particularly inviting outlook which opened on the left, as the young man stood upon the pavement. It was a shabby little road, with untidy poverty written in large letters all over the small houses. The only bit of colour to be seen was the blue pelisse fluttering down the left-hand side of it. \" Poor little girl ! \" the young man said to himself, and again a twinkle, half-amused, half-sympathetic, lighted up his eyes. Then"], [259, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 255 he glanced at the street critically, and raised his eyes doubtfully to the \" Roland Crescent \" painted on a house just above him. He lowered them again just in time to see the blue pelisse disappear into the dirtiest and shabbiest house in the road. \" Hullo ! \" he said. \" Lives hereabouts ! Per haps they'll know something about her. Now, then, where's number twelve ? Even numbers left-hand side, apparently.\" He crossed the road, and in two minutes more stood con fronted with number twelve as the house into which the blue pelisse had disappeared. There was a low whistle of amazement ; an expression of blank astonishment, developing into dismay, made its appearance on the young man's countenance ; and he stood ap parently transfixed in contemplation of the undesirable edifice before him. Then he turned away, and walked to the end of Roland Crescent, and out into the Hammer smith Road again. Half-an-hour had passed before he again presented himself at number twelve, and this"], [260, "256 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS time he rang the bell. His eyes were full of a rather rueful fun, and there was a certain comic, \" go-through-with-it-and-get-it-over \" air about him. The door was opened by a very slatternly servant. \" Is Mr. Baldwyn in ? \" said the young man. \" He expects me, I believe \u2014 Mr. John Glendinning.\" It was a narrow little passage into which Mr. John Glendinning was admitted, and it smelt strongly of cooking. A door was opened, and he advanced into a dingy sitting room, as a dilapidated and rather red-nosed man rose from an arm-chair by the fire. It is given to most of us to have unknown relatives. It is given to many of us to have undesirable relatives. It was given to John Glendinning, on this November afternoon, to discover the latter in the former. John Glendinning had come from Dresden, not solely with a view to making the ac quaintance of the gentleman with whom he was now confronted, but with that object in the foreground of his thoughts. He was visiting"], [261, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 257 his native country for the first time for ten years. Eighteen months before, his mother, between whom and himself there had existed that perfect union which dual solitude some times engenders, had died, leaving him alone in their Dresden home. Brought face to face with his second lonely Christmas, an instinct arose in him \u2014 partly the outcome of his own nature, partly the creation of that tender German sentiment which makes Christmas pre-eminently the season of domestic happi ness \u2014 towards the only human beings whom he knew as kindred. These were the family of his mother's long-dead sister. An old quarrel between the sisters, and Mrs. Glen dinning's residence abroad, had prevented any intercourse between the families. Glendinning knew only one fact about his relatives, and this one fact served as a passport to his favour. His uncle by marriage, Mr. Baldwyn, was understood by him to belong to the musical profession \u2014 and music was Glendinning's own profession and passion. He hunted out their address with difficulty, R"], [262, "258 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS and wrote, proposing to pay them a visit. He had received a gushing response, and had proceeded to carry his proposition into effect. \" I am charmed to see you, my dear boy ! Your letter was such a pleasure as not often befalls me. A very hearty welcome ! \" Mr. Baldwyn's slippers were down at heel, Mr. Baldwyn's smoking-jacket was frayed at the cuffs, and his linen was far from spotless ; but even these attributes did not render Mr. Baldwyn's greeting so indescribably incon gruous to Glendinning, in connection with himself, as did his general expression and tone of voice \u2014 the former squalid, the latter cringing. A keen sense of humour in the young man produced a reply which was an excellent imitation of the response which a less impossible relation would have drawn from him ; and just as he finished speaking a folding-door behind him opened, and Mr. Baldwyn hastened to say loudly, \" The elder of your two cousins, my dear boy ! \u2014 Nellie, your cousin John ! \" John Glendinning advanced to meet a girl"], [263, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 259 of four-and-twenty, pretty in a dark, common style, and showily dressed in red. His cousin Nellie's eyes rested upon the well-bred and well-appointed figure thus pre sented to her with a stare of astonishment ; and a touch of embarrassment did not add to the attraction of a loud and pert manner. \" Our dinner hour,\" said Mr. Baldwyn airily, \" is five. Our engagements claim our presence at half-past seven. Nellie and myself are assisting at present in the production of the new opera ; she is in the chorus, I in the orchestra. Gwendoline's engagements \u2014 Ah ! here is Gwendoline \u2014 Gwen, as we call her.\" The folding-door opened again, with a kind of reluctant snatch. John Glendinning turned quickly. There in the opening stood his opposite neighbour in the omnibus, the wearer of the blue pelisse. She was wearing a brown plush frock, indescribably shabby and dirty, and she looked lovelier than ever. She came across the room, hardly looking at the stranger, and held out her hand to him with an ill tempered thrust, and in silence."], [264, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 260 \" How do you do ? \" said John Glendinning politely. As he spoke the girl started violently. She raised her eyes to his face, and a wonderful colour rushed over her soft cheeks. She looked at him for a moment, unconscious in her sur prise that her hand still rested in his. He met her eyes and smiled. The next instant she had wrenched her hand away, and rushed out of the room, banging the door after her. The meal which presently ensued, John Glendinning never forget. The food, appoint ments, and the manners alike made it for him an occasion which was only rendered endurable by a keen sense of the ridiculous. Glendinning faced the situation as he had sometimes faced an unsuccessful picnic party \u2014 talking, laughing, ignoring. He would find himself recalled to Dresden on the very next day, that was' a foregone con clusion. But it was an odd coincidence, that whenever he found himself mentally arranging for this summons he should find"], [265, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 261 the scornful eyes of his cousin Gwen fixed upon him. \" By Jove ! \" he said to himself afterwards, \" she looked as if she knew what I was think ing. What eyes she's got ! Poor little girl ! \" He was sitting alone when this reflection occurred to him ; Mr. Baldwyn and Nellie having departed to their \" engagements.\" And he started as a touch fell on the door. Then he recollected that Gwen was in the house, and the next instant she stood on the thres hold. John Glendinning rose, and stood with his cigarette between his fingers. \" Your sister gave me leave to smoke,\" he said, by way of saying something. \" I hope it doesn't annoy you ? \" His cousin's reply was characterized by energy and little elegance. Gwen's eyes were flashing, and the rebellious mouth was set into passionate curves. \" Don't talk rubbish ! \" she said. \" Do you think I'm a fool ? Do you think I don't see that you're just putting up with us ? Why"], [266, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 262 don't you say we're not good enough, and go? That's what I've come to ask you!\" Through all the child's vulgarity of exterior, phrase, and tone there rang a fierce intensity of resentment, a sensitive passion of perception. \"If it's to pay me out for what I said in the omnibus,\" she went on vehemently, \" I shouldn't have thought that any man could be so mean ! I don't remember what I did say exactly, but of course I know the kind of thing. I knew I should hate you, but I never supposed you'd be as hateful as you are ! Is it to pay me out, I want to know ? \" Her slender figure was quivering with unrestrained passion, and as Glendinning looked at her his eyes had grown very gentle and conciliating. \" Of course it isn't,\" he said. \" I don't know what you mean. Don't distress your self about what happened in the omnibus. It didn't apply, don't you see? I'm not a Ger man ; I hope I'm not flabby ; and I don't seem likely \u2014 \" The irrepressible twinkle had"], [267, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 263 reappeared in his eyes, and Gwen stamped her foot fiercely. \" Don't ! \" she cried. \" You shan't laugh at me ! Well, why don't you go, then ? You know by this time why father was so glad to have you ! And Nellie and I don't want you ! \" A transference of coin of the realm which had taken place before Mr. Baldwyn's de parture had certainly enlightened Glendinning as to that gentleman's views ; and the undis guised scorn of her father which rang in the girlish tones touched his ready sympathies to the quick. \" That's very likely,\" he said gently, an swering her last statement. \" It is I who \u2014 \" Whether a sudden realization of the cir cumstances of the case made him hesitate, or whether she really interrupted him, John Glendinning did not know. \" You don't want us ! \" she said, with a bitter laugh. \" We're not good enough for you ! \" She paused, and then flashed out on him suddenly. \" What's the matter with us ? \""], [268, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 264 she cried. \" We're all right. What makes you treat us like this ? \" It was the desperate repudiation of a sud denly awakened doubt ; which was not to be acknowledged ; which came as a climax on years of childish discontent and rebellion, only to be hurled passionately away. The note of defiance was eloquent to Glendinning, and his voice and movements were a little uncertain as he hurriedly turned a chair to the fire for her. \" Don't let us quarrel,\" he said. \" Look here, let us sit down and talk.\" But before the words were fairly uttered Gwen had dashed out of the room. John Glendinning was not recalled to Dresden on the following day. All the half-humorous, half-pitying kindliness of his nature was arrayed against the thought of leaving Gwen with that bitter passion of resentment unassuaged in her heart. Ex actly what course of action he proposed to himself when he decided to stay in Roland Crescent for another day he hardly knew."], [269, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 265 It was useless, he saw plainly, to try and undo the effect that he had produced on the girl. Even if he could have uttered the disclaimer that the conventionalities of the situation demanded, Gwen would not have been deceived. Her perceptions were far too keen and sensitive. It was perhaps the realization of this truth that first created in Glendinning's mind the conception of possibilities in the poor little undisciplined girl ; possibilities which might, were there a hand to touch and train them, be developed into something very different ; possibilities over which he smiled or sighed, according as the humorous or sympathetic side of his nature was uppermost. And though he himself scarcely understood the reason, it was simply because of this realiza tion that he let his stay in Roland Crescent lengthen itself day after day \u2014 to Mr. Baldwyn's effusively expressed satisfaction. That Gwen's temper at this time was per fectly abominable was a fact that nobody living in the house with her attempted to"], [270, "266 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS deny. No one could come in contact with her without being, as the rough servant ex pressed it, \" scarified.\" And of all the people subjected to the \" scarifying \" process the most frequent victim was Glendinning. It seemed as if the girl could not be for five minutes in her cousin's presence without, to use her own phrase, \" flying out at him.\" Nothing he said, nothing he did, was too great or too small for Gwen to take exception to. Sometimes it was as if not only his presence, but his very personality, threw her into a sullen white heat of wrath. But the worst apple of discord between the two, the culminating point of their dissen sion, was Gwen's music. Glendinning was a musician to his finger-tips. He had made rapid strides in his profession, and one of the objects of his visit to London had been the making acquaintance with certain English musicians to whom he had introductions. His attitude towards Gwen as a musician was typical of his attitude towards her whole personality. If she had been destitute of"], [271, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 267 talent, her utter lack of knowledge and her pleasure in what was inferior, would have affected him not at all. But behind all her professional deficiencies there burnt a little spark of the fire of genius, and all the artist in her cousin tingled to give that spark fair play. |On the occasion, when Gwen forced from him the fact that he did not admire her playing, they had the battle royal which established them in the relative positions of mentor and pupil \u2014 the mentor, half earnest, half amused ; the pupil, fierce, defiant, rebel lious, and yet voluntary. They were thrown a great deal together. If Glendinning was out during the day, he dropped into the habit of being in Roland Crescent during the evening. If he were out in the evening, he would see something of Gwen during the day. And every day, at some time or other, they would find time to assume their strange relations. Not that their artistic intercourse was by any means of a more equable nature than their ordinary contact. On three evenings out of four,"], [272, "268 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS Gwen's frame of mind would be such that only a dogged obstinacy on Glendinning's part, a sheer determination to vindicate his faith in those strange possibilities in her, held him to his patient, half-amused com passion for her. Then on the fourth evening, perhaps, he would see her in an other aspect ; bitter, rebellious, defiant ; full of the passionate misery of a creature at war with her world, and only dimly and most wretchedly conscious of the existence of any other. Three weeks had come and gone in this fashion, and it was within a week of Christ mas. Gwen had been at her worst for two days past, and Glendinning, sitting by the fire with a cigar in the evening, was wonder ing idly and a little sadly whether it was of any use to try and influence her, after all. He did not hear her come into the room, and he started slightly, when he looked up, to find her standing by the fire-place looking down into the fire. He looked at her for a moment, wondering what was the improve-"], [273, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 269 ment in her appearance, of which he was vaguely conscious. Gwen, as if aware of his gaze, moved uneasily, and coloured crimson ; but she need not have feared \u2014 or hoped. His masculine eyes were unaware that they rested on her lovely hair properly brushed and neatly dressed for the first time. \" Well,\" she said, letting herself fall into a low chair, and resting her chin on her hand as she stared into the fire, \" and what do you think about Christmas here ? \" The voice was bitter and derisive, but there was a suggestion of restless unhappiness about it which gave it a less combative sound than usual. \" I think what I've always thought about it, Gwen,\" he said. \" What ! all that \u2014 that nonsense about its being a happy time \u2014 made gladder by family affection, and so on ? \" The young man coloured. They had dif fered on the subject of Christmas sentiment early in their acquaintance, and the mocking voice gave a colour to his previously expressed"], [274, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 270 opinions under which he would have liked to disown them. But he stood to his flag like a man. \" Yes,\" he said, \" I do. Of course I know there has been a heap of cant talked about Christmas ; one can't strike that out too thoroughly. But it's an awful mistake to strike out the truth as well. Look here, Gwen,\" he went on earnestly and diffidently, \" I'm not a parson ; I don't want to go in to what makes the Christmas spirit, only I've a strong notion that there is such a thing. It's not the kind of thing men create for themselves, and they make clumsy work enough with it, I don't deny. But they're the better for it, I believe ; and theirs is a baddish way when they can't feel it.\" He stopped, and took a long pull at his cigar. There was a pause, and then Gwen said, with a harsh laugh ; \" Then I'm in a baddish way, I can tell you. I hate Christmas, and that's all about it. I've always hated it more than any other time of the year ! \""], [275, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 271 To Glendinning's intense astonishment, he saw that her eyelashes were wet. While he was trying to account for a curious pain that the sight created in him, she went on in the same tone ; \" I should like to know why I shouldn't hate it ? Or what happiness it brings to me ? We shall dine at six instead of five, and father will get drunk \u2014 that's all that will happen.\" She tried to laugh, but her voice was ringing with feeling. There was a defiant sense, in her speech, of the potentialities of Christmas withheld from her ; and it was to this sense that Glendinning, striving to collect his attributes as mentor, addressed his reply. \" That's the other side of the Christmas spirit,\" he said in rather a low voice. \" That's what makes you hate it. It makes you feel you want something you haven't got \u2014 that there's a lot you might have if you chose \" \"If I chose? \"she interrupted him scorn fully. \" What has my choosing got to do with it ? \" She stopped, and then turned"], [276, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 272 suddenly upon him, springing to her feet, her eyes flashing. \" I don't want anything that I haven't got ! I'm satisfied with every thing \u2014 myself and all ! What did you ever come here for, to make me miserable ? Oh, I hate you ! I wish I'd never seen you ! \" She stood looking down upon him, her lovely face aglow, her childish figure quiver ing with passionate emotion. And as if some electrical current had passed from her to him, Glendinning sprang up also, his face flushed and agitated. \" Gwen ! \" he cried, \u2014 \" Gwen ! you don't mean that ? You don't mean that ? \" The last words echoed in an empty room, for Gwen was gone. For some time John Glendinning stood where she had left him, as though rooted to the spot. Then the colour faded out of his face, and he sat down with something very like a groan. He had prided himself on his powers of perception ; he had admired his realization of the incongruity between Gwen's manners and her deeper nature ; he had"], [277, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 273 flattered himself that he was undertaking a gratuitous and disinterested work in trying to develop her. And all the time there had been developing in himself, entirely unsus pected, an incongruity before which the other was as nothing. He, John Glendinning, his vulgar little cousin's mentor, patron, and superior, had been learning, while he in structed, the old, old lesson of love. Glen dinning did not attempt to argue the matter with himself. He loved Gwen ; loved her with all her faults and failings ; loved the struggling artist nature, the half-dormant woman's soul, which he himself had rendered sentient. It would not serve him to deny the fact. For the time being he could only sit and stare at it in blank dismay. Then he began to think about the future. What was he to do? If Glendinning could have believed that he had unwittingly taught Gwen the lesson which he himself had learned, a sense of honour would have acted as compulsion, and he might have asked her to be his wife with s"], [278, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 274 that semi-reluctance which compulsion en genders. But during the three days that followed the evening of his discovery, Glen dinning became convinced that Gwen did indeed hate him. If speech with him was by any means to be avoided she did not speak to him at all ; if it was inevitable, her observations were almost savage. All that was worst in her, in thought, manner, and speech \u2014 characteristics which had softened during the previous three weeks- \u2014 seemed to be accentuated now, deliberately, until there were times when his love for her seemed to the young man to be little short of insanity. And yet, in spite of the rough nature of the soil in which it was set, that love grew and flourished. Demonstrations of the futility of his position were all in vain, and Glendin ning was indescribably wretched. On Christmas Eve there was to be a charity concert at one of the smaller halls, for which both Glendinning and Gwen were engaged. Gwen was to appear as one of a string quar tette consisting of girl musicians of the same"], [279, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 275 calibre as herself, who added to the attractions of their performance by dressing alike in fancy costume. Glendinning's name had been added to the programme only a week before, and the circumstance had made an odd little bond of union between the two. Now, however, this bond of union seemed to be transformed into an inexhaustible source of bitterness. Gwen refused, fiercely, to accompany Glen dinning when he practised ; she substituted a showy piece of music for the graceful old gavotte that he had persuaded her to play ; she absolutely flaunted all the preparations for the fancy dress that she knew he disliked ; and utterly declined his escort to the concert room. She would go with the other girls, she said, and then he needn't recognize her if he didn't like her dress. He could amuse himself with the friends who were good enough for him. The friends thus bitingly alluded to were a young pianist and his sister, in whose hands the arrangement of the concert had chiefly lain, and who had asked Glendinning to sing."], [280, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 276 They were well-bred, clever, and enthusiastic ; they had taken a fancy to Glendinning ; and thus it happened that when Gwen and her companions entered the artists' room her cousin was talking and laughing with Miss Marchant. Gwen cast in their direction one flashing glance, in which her miserable, scornful eyes seemed to take in every detail of the other woman's dainty dress, and then she turned sharply away and dragged off her own cloak, revealing the tawdry, theatrical finery under neath. The quartette appeared almost immedi ately, and during the intervals before and after Glendinning's song she entirely ignored his presence, laughing and talking with her companions with a persistency that almost entirely frustrated his intention of speaking to her. Her own solo came late in the pro gramme, just after a song by Miss Marchant. Glendinning, miserable beyond words, was enthusiastically discussing the song's merits with the singer, as Gwen left the room ; and she passed them with her childish face oddly"], [281, "AN IDYLL OF AN OMNIBUS 277 flushed and set. The door of the artists' room was open, and as the first notes of the violin floated down, Miss Marchant started. \" Who is that ? \" she said. \" What a tone ! Let us go and listen, Mr. Glendinning.\" It was the gavotte, after all ; and Gwen was playing, as Glendinning had never heard her play yet, with a passionate feeling and a wild, erratic power that took the audience by storm. She ran down the few steps when she had finished amid a tumult of applause ; and as she passed the pair who had been listening to her, Miss Marchant said excitedly, \" Who is she, Mr. Glendinning ? I saw you speak to her some time ago. Introduce me to her.\" Gwen, fumbling blindly for her cloak, heard the words, and faced round sharply, her eyes on Glendinning. To the young man their tempestuous glance conveyed a flat defiance. It seemed to him that Gwen was absolutely forbidding him to introduce her. He hesitated. He saw Gwen's eyes change. He saw something leap up in them that he had never seen in their depths before. Then"], [282, "278 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS he realized that she had thrown her cloak around her and had dashed out of the room, and that he was following her involuntarily and instinctively, his heart throbbing wildly. As though impelled by an irresistible impulse, she ran down the stairs, and ran on, even when she was in the street, making in stinctively, as Glendinning understood, for the corner from which her omnibus would start. An insane belief that if she escaped him now he would never again see the Gwen into whose eyes he had looked for that one moment, literally possessed him. He saw her rush across the road and jump into an empty omnibus. Regardless of horses and vehicles, he rushed across after her and jumped into the same omnibus just as it moved on. With the same odd impulse that had dictated her flight through the streets, she had buried herself in the farther corner of the dim vehicle, crouching back against the cushions.

I. On a certain Sunday evening in September Abbots Corton church was packed from end to end. It was a great occasion with Abbots Corton. As long as the memory of the oldest inhabitant could go back, the village had been singularly unfortunate in its spiritual pastors. They had been absentees, illiterate, old and incapable ; and they had one and all been poor and under-bred. This particular Sunday witnessed the professional appear ance of a new Vicar, whose arrival had been preceded by rumours quite electrifying in their satisfactoriness. He was reported to be a gentleman, well-born and well-bred, to be young, and at the same time not too young \u2014"], [288, "284 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS one-and-thirty years old. He was understood to be rather \" high \" \u2014 a notion not unpleasing to Abbots Corton, as conveying comfortably indefinite prospects of excitement. He had very respectable private means, and he was to be married as soon as he was fairly settled down, to a certain Miss Sylvia Marsden, only known in Abbots Corton at present by name, but said to be a very charming young lady, and an heiress into the bargain. Under the circumstances, therefore, it was not surprising that Abbots Corton had been exceptionally devout on this September Sunday. The church had been full in the morning, but \" evening church \" had brought out the parish in its entirety. It was an occasion, also, for the Reverend Maurice Drury. He was standing that Sunday for the first time in a pulpit of his own, facing a congregation for which he was solely responsible ; and the position was fraught with a not inconsiderable amount of excitement and satisfaction. It is not every cleric who finds himself in possession of a"], [289, "SO AS BY FIRE 285 parish, a house and garden, and a very respectable income, and can contemplate the easy entrance upon married life, at one-and thirty. The Reverend Maurice Drury was perfectly pleased with life and the world at large. As he stood there in his pulpit, the focus of so many eyes, the Reverend Maurice was neither nervous nor anxious. He was calmly convinced of his own capacity, the excellence of his intentions, his general right-mindedness ; convinced of these things with that unconscious self-satisfaction which reaches its highest ex pression in that type of man which takes itself as representing in the concrete all the attributes of priesthood in the abstract, and thus absolutely loses sight of individual deviations of character. His attitude towards that sermon on which his new parishioners were presumably so intent, was eminently typical of his attitude towards any work which he had accomplished. It was to him the production not of Maurice Drury, but of a priest of the Church of England ;"], [290, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 286 and as such it was obviously not to be lightly criticized by him or by any other man. His attitude towards the cure of souls on which he was entering was equally typical of his manner of approaching any undertaking, large or small. He was satisfied that all the industry, wisdom, and devotion with which he, as a priest, was necessarily endowed, would be spent to the uttermost in the service of the Abbots Corton people. That those priestly qualities might prove, as at present exhibited in his person, insufficient for the needs they were to meet, was a consideration which was far from him. He was a good-looking man ; and he looked particularly attractive, with the elation of that evening service upon him, as he did the honours of his supper-table afterwards to his churchwarden and that gentleman's wife. He had well-cut features, of which the chief charm, as yet, lay in the frank and simple pleasantness of the expression. If there were faint suggestions of too well self-satisfied lines about the mouth, which might in time develop"], [291, "SO AS BY FIRE 287 and stamp the face on far less desirable lines, the suggestion was contradicted for the present by singularly good grey eyes. \" As to any pressing cases of sickness, now, Dr. Bearne? Perhaps you will give me a list.\" The Reverend Maurice cut some bread as he spoke, with a vigour which would have argued for those same cases of sickness a somewhat bracing form of consolation, had it not been for a latent suggestion of something more sympathetic in his well-tuned voice. The man whom he addressed was a stout, lethargic, middle-aged man, who had settled down in Abbots Corton to a small country practice twenty years before. To those who knew Mrs. Bearne, no more conclusive evidence of the dead weight of her husband's passivity was possible than the fact that he was still a resident of Abbots Corton. Mrs. Bearne, who was sitting now at Maurice Drury's right hand, was a woman with a wiry figure, high cheekbones, a high colour, and dead brown hair. She was currently supposed to possess"], [292, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 288 the sharpest tongue in Abbots Corton. She and her husband, and the new Vicar, were not entire strangers to one another. The personal acquaintance between them was of the slightest ; but Mrs. Bearne was a distant cousin of the young lady to whom Maurice Drury was engaged \u2014 Miss Sylvia Marsden. On the strength of this connection, together with her husband's position as churchwarden \u2014 a position, as all the village knew, enforced upon him by his wife \u2014 Mrs. Bearne had set up the friendliest lines of communication with the new-comer ; and during supper had bestowed information as to his new parish upon him almost faster than he could ask for it. As her husband, on Maurice Drury's words, began to fumble in his pocket, his wife spoke for him. \" You'll be surprised to find how little illness there is in Abbots Corton ! \" she said. \" There's plenty of shamming, of course \u2014 when there's anything to be got, or to be shirked \u2014 but very little illness ! \" The Reverend Maurice smiled courteously."], [293, "SO AS BY FIRE 289 \" A clean bill of health is a capital thing ! \" he said. \" 111 health complicates most terribly the troubles and anxieties of the poor ! \" He paused a moment, cutting another slice of bread slowly and even absently. \" And talking of troubles,\" he continued, \" I noticed one or two faces this evening which spoke of its presence with noticeable eloquence. It is a curious thing, Mrs. Bearne, to look into that crowd of faces, each with its own history of hopes and fears ; histories of which one is at present so absolutely ignorant ; with which one is destined, please Heaven, to become so familiar.\" He paused again, after uttering his little commonplace, and then added ; \" Can you tell me the name of a lady in black who sat at the end of the church, in the corner of the last pew ? A tall woman, very pale, and with striking eyes. I have never seen a face which gave me a stronger feeling that behind it was a soul needing help and consolation ! \" A certain rigidity, the outward expression evidently of some strong and hostile feeling, T"], [294, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 290 had come upon Mrs. Bearne during this speech, uttered with that lofty superiority to any sense of sex which is one of the priestly attributes ; and as the Reverend Maurice paused, the doctor's wife tossed her head with an air which was a curious commentary on her words. \" There is no lady \" \u2014 with a slight emphasis on the substantive \u2014 \" in Abbots Corton beside myself, Mr. Drury. As to the woman to whom you refer, yes, I did see her, and I can tell you who she is. Did you notice, Robert ? Mrs. Neale actually had the effrontery to come to church ! \" His wife's words roused Dr. Bearne to a momentary life. \" You don't say so ! \" he ejaculated. \" Ah,'\" turning to the Reverend Maurice, \" I'm afraid you've lighted upon one of your first difficulties ! \" Maurice Drury had looked from the wife to the husband and back again with a look of inquiry. It was not wholly sympathetic inquiry, and an embryonic disapproval had."], [295, "SO AS BY FIRE 291 leaped into his eyes at Mrs. Bearne's last words. \" Who is she ? \" he said. \" As to being a difficulty,\" returned Mrs. Bearne, clipping off her words, \" there is no difficulty about the matter. It only needs some one to take the matter resolutely in hand. Of course she must be summarily dismissed. That woman, Mr. Drury, is Mrs. Neale, the school-mistress.\" \" Indeed ! \" The exclamation was a singular mixture of astonishment and questioning, and the Reverend Maurice followed it quickly with the question \u2014 \" And what is there against her ? \" Mrs. Bearne's gesture was eloquent. \" For months, and months, and months,\" she said volubly, \" I have been saying to Doctor Bearne, ' You are one of the trustees of the school \u2014 bestir yourself. Write to the Bishop. Write to Lord Corton. Do some thing to put a stop to such a scandalous state of things ! ' And for months and months he has said that it must wait for the new Vicar."], [296, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 292 It's a very unpleasant thing for a new man, of course, but your first official act must certainly be the dismissal of Mrs. Neale ! \" \" What has she done ? \" demanded the new Vicar. Mrs. Bearne's voice sank to an impressive whisper. \" Drink ! \" she said. \" My dear Mr. Drury, like a fish ! It's an open secret. Everybody knows it. Last time I saw her \u2014 that was on Friday night \u2014 she opened her door to me in such a state that she could hardly stand ! \" \" Is it possible ? \" Astonishment, incredulity, horror, had chased one another across the Reverend Maurice's face with amazing rapidity; and all these emotions were blended, in the exclama tion with which he responded, with a strong and lively pity. The astonishment and horror alone were patent to Mrs. Bearne's ear, and she replied to them alone. \" That's what you would feel, of course!\" she said. \" How such a state of things can have been allowed to go on I don't know ! Of"], [297, "SO AS BY FIRE 293 course the woman is too clever to let it inter fere with the school work. The inspector actually had the impertinence to tell me, last time he was here, that he hadn't any fault to find. It just shows how utterly neglected Abbots Corton has been. However, you've all the power, practically, in your own hands, and you've only to dismiss her at once.\" The era of neglect was over for Abbots Corton, arguing from the proceedings of the Reverend Maurice Drury on the following Monday morning. By half-past nine he was in the parish, cheerful, indefatigable, pleasant in look and in manner. He was the object of breathless interest throughout the length and breadth of the straggling village all the morning ; but at one o'clock Abbots Corton transferred its interest to its dinner, and for the moment the figure of the new Vicar was the only figure visible in the village street. He was standing on the plot of grass which faced the school-house, evidently going through a mental debate. Should he go home to his"], [298, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 294 dinner, or should he pay another visit? There was a shadow on his face which had touched it more than once during the morning. Rather suddenly \u2014 for so pre-eminently well balanced a mind \u2014 he came to a decision. He turned his back upon the Vicarage, crossed the road to the cottage attached to the school house, and knocked at the door. The new Vicar and the school-mistress had met already that morning in their official capacities ; consequently no introduction of himself lay before Maurice Drury. Nor had the innumerable introductions which he had already effected that morning discomposed him in the least. Nevertheless, as he stood waiting, there was a distinct suggestion of embarrassment about his face, and his eyes were vaguely troubled. His sudden assump tion of an even excessive priestly composure as the door was opened, rather pointed to the growth than the decrease of that' embarrass ment. \" I hope this is not an inconvenient hour for a visit from me, Mrs. Neale ? \" he said."], [299, "SO AS BY FIRE 295 \" The late afternoon might perhaps have suited you better.\" The woman who had opened the door was tall and finely proportioned. She had a beautiful head admirably set upon her shoulders. Her features had evidently once been very handsome ; and marred as they now were by the expression of bitterness and defiance which lurked in every line, there was still an almost painful beauty about them. They were lighted up by a pair of large dark eyes which looked for a moment, sullen and sombre, full into the new Vicar's face. Then, as though the result of the scrutiny had in fluenced her in spite of herself, with a gesture which was very dignified and courteous \u2014 and not the less so in that it was somewhat distant \u2014 Mrs. Neale stood back and welcomed her visitor into her cottage. \" Not at all ! \" she said ; her voice was low and not unmusical, though rather toneless. \" Will you come in ? \" The words were simple ; the manner, too, though somewhat incongruous with the"], [300, "296 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS position of the woman on whom it sat so easily, was by no means startling. There was no per ceptible reason, in short, for the change which fell upon the Reverend Maurice Drury in the few steps between the door and the little parlour. The sudden assumption of priestliness with which he had confronted his school mistress, slipped away from him as though it had never been, and it took with it all the usual characteristics of his demeanour ; ac centuating in its departure all the embarrass ment which had sat so curiously upon him as he waited on the threshold, and leaving him perturbed, uncertain, and singularly anxious. \" What a charming view there is from this part of the village ! \" he said, obviously for the sake of saying something. Mrs. Neale glanced at him quickly. \" Yes ! \" she said. \" I \u2014 I must wait until next year, of course, to see the place to the best advantage from a picturesque point of view ! \" \" No doubt ! \" Mrs. Neale glanced at him again, and at"], [301, "SO AS BY FIRE 297 the same moment Maurice Drury gave what should evidently have been a fleeting glance in her direction. Their eyes met, and on the instant, as though touched to the quick, Mrs. Neale rose abruptly and turned away. \" Mr. Drury,\" she said, \" it is kind of you to treat me like this, but I think it will be easier for both of us if you come to the point at once.\" She hurried out the words in a tone which seemed to struggle for hard indifference, and then stood with her back to her visitor, looking out of the window. Maurice Drury leaned forward quickly. \" Thank you,\" he said earnestly ; \" that is very kind of you. Then will you not let me see whether I cannot help you ? You are very terribly burdened ! If, without intrusion on my part, you could open your heart to me, I have no doubt that I could be of some assistance to you.\" The form of the words was professional, almost conventional ; but there was nothing professional in his tone ; nothing but a very"], [302, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 298 genuine and sympathetic manliness. And as he finished, Mrs. Neale turned suddenly and faced him, a strange flash and quiver on her face. \"You don't know what you're saying,\" she said. \" I'm the great disgrace of your parish. What you have to do is to dismiss me.\" She lifted her hand with a gesture at once defiant and despairing, and Maurice Drury spoke quickly and urgently, completely passing over her final words. \" From what terrible lack of counsel and support you have suffered, of course I cannot tell. Forgive me if my directness seems ex cessive ! In matters such as these, where all that is best in life is at stake, one can no more stand on ceremony than can the doctor called in for some physical ailment.\" A sudden fleeting, illuminating smile crossed her face, and he answered it promptly, a certain glow upon his own. \" You have not called me in ? That's true, of course. But I am called in, nevertheless,"], [303, "SO AS BY FIRE 299 by right of my profession, and you won't refuse my help?\" Very slowly ; with her eyes fixed full upon the earnest face, which seemed to have gained in expression as it lost in assurance ; with a slight tremble about the mouth, which seemed just about to break into one of those wonder ful smiles, Mrs. Neale moved. She crossed the little room, and sat down facing Maurice Drury. \" Help me ? \" she said. \" No, you can't do that, but \u2014 it is years since any human creature offered me help.\" The school-bell was ringing clamorously when Maurice Drury left the little cottage. He walked briskly away in the direction of the Vicarage, his face grave and intent.

It passes credit, after her goings-on all this time, and that it does ! \" The response to this speech was something between a snort and a sniff, and Mrs. Bearne shook out a pillow-case from the pile of clean linen which she was examining, and held it up to the light in ominous silence. It was a frosty, November day, nearly two months after the new Vicar's arrival at Abbots Corton, and through the window of what Mrs. Bearne called the \" linen-room \" the sun fell in reddish rays on that lady and her housemaid and general factotum. The latter, a gaunt, hard-featured, elderly woman, ap parently found her mistress's demeanour rather encouraging than otherwise. \" What's your own opinion in the matter, ma'am, if I may make so bold ? \" she went on"], [305, "SO AS BY FIRE 301 after a moment. \" Do you think as she's really a reformed character ? \" Mrs. Bearne's sniff was open and undisguised this time, and she poked a bony finger viciously through a weak place in the linen in her hands as she answered ; \" That's as it may be, Sarah ! All I do say is, that I never knew such sudden reformations come to any good in my experience. Neither have I heard that it was for the advantage of such people to set them in prominent positions. Mrs. Neale may be going to teach me better, or she may not. I say nothing ! \" That Sarah should shake her head in grim foreboding, which argued slight faith in Mrs. Neale's powers in the direction indicated, was a foregone conclusion. Evidently emboldened by the reception of her question, she dropped her voice from the key of the tentative to that of the confidential gossip. \" But there's those as will say something, ma'am ! \" she said. \" There's those as think as more harm may come of a trumped-up reformation than enough.

I wonder where he's going ! \" Mrs. Bearne had risen involuntarily at Sarah's exclamation. She stood still, half hidden by the curtains, and the two women watched in silence as the now familiar figure of the Reverend Maurice Drury strode down the road past the house. They watched it on until it turned into the school-yard, from which the children had emerged about half an-hour before. Then Sarah turned. Her eyes and those of her mistress met, and it"], [307, "SO AS BY FIRE 303 would have been difficult to say in which pair of eyes there dwelt the more unpleasant expression. The Reverend Maurice meanwhile had presented \u2014 and presented truly enough \u2014 every appearance of absolute unconsciousness that such eyes could rest upon him from any corner of Abbots Corton. During the time which had passed since his arrival everything had gone with him \u2014 as in his own opinion it could never fail to do \u2014 perfectly smoothly and satisfactorily. The plans for the benefit of his people with which he had come primed were all well under weigh and working to admiration ; there was not an individual in his charge with whom he was not on friendly terms ; and as a priestly counsellor and sus tainer he had made one notable success. He went down the village, under those unpleasant eyes, the serenely satisfied and satisfying parish priest to the last crease in his coat : he stopped to admonish a truant Sunday scholar with that impersonal leniency towards the failings of youth which is not incompatible"], [308, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 304 with judicial sternness ; and then knocked at Mrs. Neale's door. This knock was answered almost immediately. The work of the past six weeks \u2014 in one direction at least \u2014 the outcome of constant intercourse, of mutual confidence, of mutual sympathy, was plainly and simply visible in the slight greeting with which the school mistress and the Vicar met. All that differed in the Reverend Maurice's manner to-day from his manner under similar conditions six weeks before \u2014 the absence of embarrassment, of the trouble and perturbation which had marked his first visit to that cottage \u2014 told much. But the singular characteristic about him, common to both occasions, was infinitely more significant. The ease which had come to him with Mrs. Neale was not his priestly ease ; it was something much more eager and less impersonal. Now, as at his first call on her, his professionalism seemed to slip away, unconsciously to himself, as he came into contact with her. Mrs. Neale was his notable success as priest and confessor ; as such he"], [309, "SO AS BY FIRE 305 thought of her ; as such \u2014 in discreet and ambiguous words \u2014 he spoke of her. Yet in her presence, not only did he evince no access of priestly dignity or patronage, but his ex pression and manner became distinctly less assured and less self-satisfied. \" I've brought you the music for the choir practice to-morrow,\" he said. \" Thanks, no ; I can't come in. I only wanted to know whether you thought the boys can manage the chant I've marked.\" Mrs. Neale took the book he offered without making any direct answer. \" You are not \u2014 learning wisdom ? \" she said. The handsome, worn face, and the low, toneless voice had altered greatly during the past six weeks. It was not merely the altera tion which witnessed to the developed rela tions between the man and woman who, six weeks before, had been strangers to one another. The mouth, as it smiled slightly over the words, had almost lost its bitterness, had entirely lost its sullenness. There was a u"], [310, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 306 dreamy softness in the dark eyes as she raised them suddenly to Maurice Drury's face, which seemed to pervade every feature with a strange touch of quiet. He met her eyes and smiled with a steady strength and sympathy, which no one who had known him, six weeks ago, would have looked for in him. \" Don't quarrel with my wisdom,\" he said. \" I wish it were a better thing for your sake. But such as it is, you have promised to abide by it in this instance. Look,\" he went on quickly and gently, pointing to a passage in the music, \" that's rather a difficult interval ! Do you think we can manage it ? \" She answered him on the same lines, throw ing herself into the musical question with quiet interest ; and nearly ten minutes passed, as they discussed the relative merits of chant and chant in the fast falling twilight of the November afternoon, before Maurice Drury finally shook hands. He turned away, and then took a quick step or two back to the thres hold where the tall, graceful figure still stood."], [311, "SO AS BY FIRE 307 \"You \u2014 you don't dislike it?\" he said, and his voice was strangely wistful and diffident. There was a momentary pause. Then Mrs. Neale answered slowly and softly ; \" No, I don't \u2014 dislike it. And as time goes on I shall like it better.\" That the new Vicar, instead of dealing summarily with the difficulty which presented itself to him in the shape of his school-mistress,. should propose to smooth it away by reform ing Mrs. Neale, was a surprise which Abbots Corton had hardly assimilated when the Reverend Maurice had announced a decision which electrified it. Possibly the Reverend Maurice was aware that it was a fairly daring thing in decisions ; possibly he had a certain pride in its character ; in any case, he an nounced it and carried it into effect with an air of lofty superiority to criticism. The organist of Abbots Corton church was an unwilling and incapable stop-gap who must obviously be replaced as speedily as possible. Mrs. Neale was a competent organ ist and an excellent musician, and Mrs. Neale"], [312, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 308 was willing to undertake the duties. Mrs. Neale, therefore, was to be appointed organist, and there were to be practices at the school every Wednesday evening. Two of these Wednesday evenings and two Sundays had come and gone since this \u2014 to Abbots Corton \u2014 amazing appointment, when Maurice Drury, after unconsciously running the gauntlet of two pairs of disapproving eyes, discussed chants with his new organist in the November twilight. Mrs. Neale had proved herself everything that the Vicar had asserted her to be as a musician ; and she had developed unsuspected gifts for dealing with choir boys. Week after week followed on, bringing each its Wednesday practice and its Sunday service, and Abbots Corton looked on with a covert interest and curiosity which grew week by week less covert and more pronounced. The practices with the choir were supplemented by long practices, on Mrs. Neale's part, on the \u2022church organ ; and it was perfectly well known that not one of those practices drew to an end without a visit to the church from"], [313, "SO AS BY FIRE 309 the Vicar. Mrs. Neale was vaguely under stood to be \" studying music,\" and, when she was not practising in the church, it seemed to happen with great frequency that the Vicar had a book or a paper on the subject which he wished her to see, and which he was con sequently obliged to take to her cottage. His interest in his convert was eminently natural, and patent as such to the whole village. But the whispers to the effect that it might perhaps have been better if Mrs. Neale had remained unregenerate \u2014 to which Mrs. Bearne's Sarah had alluded \u2014 developed, as such whispers will ; the hints as to the inadvisability of concentrated interest in a female parishioner, on the part of a parish priest, grew from hinting into open gossip. Nobody, however, could say that Mrs. Neale was not, for the moment at least, \" reformed.\" She went about the village, quiet and dignified, taking no heed apparently of the glances and whisperings which her appearance excited ; and the closest scrutiny to which her life could be subjected revealed only immaculate"], [314, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 310 sobriety. The fact served in some mysterious way to strengthen the gossip of which she was half the centre ; and this gossip was at its height when quite suddenly the crash came. To the seventh of those Wednesday practices, into the school-room, into the pre sence of some ten of the most eminently re spectable men and girls of the village, Mrs. Neale came hopelessly drunk. One of the girls only \u2014 one who had seen the face of the Vicar as his eyes fell upon that stumbling, swaying figure \u2014 never had any- thing to say of that terrible episode. She stood apart, shaking and crying, as Maurice Drury, with a gesture which hushed into awe- stricken silence the horrified murmurs which were rising from the choir, strode down the room to where the school-mistress had clutched stupidly at a chair ; took the unsteady figure firmly by the arm ; said in a low, choked voice, \" Come ! \" and led her unresisting out \u25a0of the room. But \u2014 with that one exception \u2014 there were as many versions of the scene as there had"], [315, "SO AS BY FIRE 311 been spectators of it, flying through Abbots Corton half-an-hour later. And the next morning the Vicar's churchwarden and fellow trustee of the school called at the Vicarage \u2014 represented by his wife. \" Of course, after this, you will feel that there is no alternative ! \" said Mrs. Bearne, having opened the conversation in trenchant tones. Her eyes were riveted on Maurice Drury's face with an expression of intent curiosity and lively condemnation. \" That woman must go, of course, and immediately.\" From the countenance of the Vicar of Abbots Corton every trace of colour was absent ; and with it seemed to have departed all the ease and serenity, all that professional ism, which usually tinged his sorrow over an erring sheep with a lofty calm. Strive as he might and did for his usual demeanour, his pale face was the face of a man agitated and distressed almost beyond his own self control. \" It is a most \u2014 a most terrible occurrence ! \" he said, hurriedly and unevenly. \" No one"], [316, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 312 can regret it more deeply than I \u2014 unless, by this time, it is the \u2014 the unhappy \" he broke off abruptly, and Mrs. Bearne took up the word with biting emphasis. \" The woman herself must be made to re gret it practically,\" she said. \" Too much indulgence has been shown her already. I was not surprised when I heard what had happened, I must say. When I saw Mrs. Neale in the afternoon \u2014 I happened to call on her \u2014 her manner was, to say the least, ex tremely odd. You'll dismiss her this morning,. of course ? \" She stopped, demanding an answer point blank. Maurice Drury hesitated and faltered for a moment, and then, with a great effort, he drew about him the scattered rags of his priestly demeanour, and spoke ; his pale, troubled face giving him a dignity which his serenity had never known. \" I cannot say, Mrs. Bearne. It must de pend on \u2014 many things. Pardon my reminding you that we are told by our Divine Master that ' Blessed are the merciful.' I fear I must"], [317, "SO AS BY FIRE 313 ask you to excuse me now. I have an engagement.\" Abbots Corton was on the tip-toe of ex pectation all through that day ; but it was not until late in the November afternoon that it saw, by dint of much straining and prying, the tall figure of the Vicar go up through the school-yard, knock briefly at the door of Mrs. Neale's cottage, and then pass quickly in, leaving his parishioners to consume themselves with curiosity and conjecture. No words passed between the two as Mrs. Neale, standing back in the shadow, opened the door. In silence Maurice Drury passed on into the little sitting-room ; and in silence she followed him. She shut the door, and stood with her hand still on the latch. There was a little paraffin-lamp on the table, and its light, which flung uncertain shadows about the untidy room, fell full upon her as she stood outlined against the door. She was very pale, and her eyes were dull and sunken ; her dress and hair were dis hevelled and neglected ; she supported herself"], [318, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 314 heavily by the hand upon the latch. From head to foot she was weighed down by the degrading physical consequences of her fall. But, infinitely more degrading, crushing her to the earth, there was upon her the cloud of unspeakable shame ; shame which spoke in every line of her figure, in every line of her hard, sullen face, and in the set, defiant stare of her eyes. Maurice Drury looked at her. If he had been pale that morning, he was ashen now. He looked at her, and the set lines of his face gave way a little ; his lips twitched. \" Won't you speak to me ? \" he said at last. His voice was low, and rather hoarse, and as she heard it, the hands of the woman to whom he spoke locked themselves fiercely together. Her lips moved convulsively, but she made no audible reply. \" Don't think of me as forcing myself upon you,\" he went on. A slight touch of intense appeal had crept into his voice, and it was a subtly-conveyed but indisputable fact, that"], [319, "SO AS BY FIRE 315 his words contained no allusion to his authority as Vicar ; that he was not even conscious of any such authority, but was totally pre occupied by something infinitely more personal and intimate. \" Don't add to what we are both suffering, by holding me aloof! Don't, for Heaven's sake, look as though I were here to humiliate you or to reproach you ! Only tell me \u2014 what happened. Explain.\" The last word vibrated, low-toned as it was, through the little room. A slight shuddering had seized upon Mrs. Neale as he spoke, and as he finished a spasm passed across her face, and she turned her eyes for an instant towards him. Then she looked away again sullenly, with a gesture of absolutely desperate indif ference. \"There's nothing to explain,\" she said, in a thin, sullen voice. \" You made a mistake about me, that's all. It was sure to happen sooner or later ; any one would tell you that.\" \" But it's not true.\" The response came promptly, ringing with unalterable conviction. Maurice Drury's fingers tightened round his"], [320, "316 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS hat. \" I've made no mistake. I know you ; and I know that what has happened could not have happened without some hideous, exciting cause. Don't tell me the miserable platitudes that disguise truth.

It ought to be.\" There was a recklessness about her voice which seemed to pierce Maurice Drury to the quick, and he answered her impetuously. \" Don't torture me like that,\" he cried. \" Something must have shaken you, distressed you. Some sudden temptation must have come upon you. Tell me what it was, that we may fight it and pray against it together, and guard against it for the future. Tell me.\"' \" Tell you ! \" she echoed. The sullen quiet of her demeanour was breaking up. Two"], [321, "SO AS BY FIRE 317 faint spots of colour were dawning on either cheek ; and a harsh laugh broke from her. \" How can I tell you of what doesn't exist ? Nothing happened to me yesterday \u2014 except that Mrs. Bearne came to see me for the first time for two months. Was her visit infliction enough to call for such consolation, do you think ? \" There was a curious gleam in her eyes as she flashed a quick, furtive glance at him ; but Maurice Drury, raising his hand to his eyes with a movement of intolerable pain, missed it. Baffled and wounded beyond expression, evidently, by her demeanour, he stood so for a moment in silence. At last he lifted his head. \" I cannot believe you ! \" he said ; his voice was hurried, low, and uneven. \" I will not believe you ! If it were as you say, the future would be so infinitely more difficult, so in finitely more full of pain and struggle ! But, even if it is so, the struggle must lead to conquest !

Suppose I don't feel sure ? \" A sudden and perceptible tremor shot through Maurice Drury; his very lips grew whiter ; he was evidently struggling hard to control himself. His voice, as he spoke, was strained and difficult with the effort he made to speak with quiet, reasonable assurance. \" You cannot judge of yourself to-night,\" he said. \" You are \u2014 suffering too much.

It's life or death! What do I care for you ? Good Heaven ! \""], [324, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 320 He had taken two steps across the little room ; they were standing face to face and close together. His hands were stretched towards her, all but clasping hers, when he stopped short with that hoarse ejaculation, and let them fall heavily at his side. There was a dead silence in the room ; silence broken only by the breathing of the two as they stood motionless, their white faces close together, their strained eyes gazing full each into the other's. Then, gradually, over Maurice Drury's horror-stricken, petrified features there came a change. A red flush crept into his face, crept on until it dyed the very roots of his hair. A dull agony of con scious shame and unspeakable self-conviction stole into every feature. As his face changed, the face of the woman who confronted him seemed to flash for a moment, and then to become still and set. Her glance became conscious and steady, and her eyes were still unwavering when Maurice Drury's eyes dropped at last, and he moved slowly and uncertainly a pace or two from her."], [325, "SO AS BY FIRE 321 \" I \u2014 beg your pardon,\" he muttered. And the next moment he was gone. Nothing could be more conducive, not only to the suppression, but to the absolute obliter ation of all emotion, than a meeting in face of some fifty round-eyed children, and three equally round-eyed pupil-teachers. At half past nine next morning the school-mistress, with her pupils and her staff, rose to receive the Vicar, as she had done on every week-day morning for nearly three months, with an absolutely composed countenance. But as her eyes rested on the Reverend Maurice Drury's face, a1 slight shock, as of surprise, crossed her own features. Maurice Drury's whole appearance was that of a man labouring under some strong and hardly-to-be-controlled excitement. His eyes were dark-ringed and sunken as with a sleep less night, and his mouth was nervous and agitated. He opened school, and gave his lesson in a brief, hesitating, uneven manner, which seemed to point to some incessant undercurrent of thought ; and x"], [326, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 322 then, as the school rose for his departure, he paused. \" I have a piece of news for you, children,\" he said, \"and \u2014 for your teachers, too.\" He did not glance as he spoke to where the head mistress stood, on his right hand. \" I wish you to be prepared to receive a visitor in the course of the morning \u2014 a visitor whom Mrs. Bearne will bring to see you \u2014 for whom you must all do your very best. She is a young lady of whom you have all heard, though her visit is as great a surprise to you, as it was to me to find her at Mrs Bearne's last night.\" These last words, which, indeed, seemed some what superfluous information for the children, seemed to come from their Vicar with some difficulty. \" The young lady I mean is Miss Sylvia Marsden ! \""], [327, "SO AS BY FIRE 323 III. It was six hours later. Miss Sylvia Marsden had asked and obtained a half-holiday for the school. At three o'clock the school-children were scattered over the village, and their mis tress sat quite alone in her little parlour. She was sitting in a chair by the table, just as she had flung herself down when she came in from the school, two hours before. She was sitting with her elbows resting on the table, supporting her chin on her two hands, staring straight before her with unseeing eyes. Her face was very white, and it had so changed its character as to be hardly recogniz able. The immobility, now of sullenness, now of quiet reserve, which had been so marked a feature with her, had broken up and dis appeared before a fierce passion of vivid life. The intense set of the features spoke of ruth less, daring resolution ; the whole pose of the figure spoke of conscious self-assertive power ;"], [328, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 324 and in the wild, sombre eyes there was that final factor, without which vivid life is not \u2014 a mortal agony of struggle. Her faculties were so utterly absorbed, that a low, hesitating knock at the cottage door failed to reach her brain. When it was repeated after a pause, she only changed her position slightly. It came a third time, and at last she heard it. She rose mechanically, went to the door, and opened it. As her eyes fell upon the figure on the threshold, a flash of intense realization passed across her white face and left it hard as stone. It was a pretty, slight girl who looked up into her face ; a girl with the brown eyes, brown hair, and softly rounded face common to hundreds of English girls. She and the school-mistress had met before that day. It was Miss Sylvia Marsden. Miss Sylvia Marsden's face was flushed, and her eyes were gentle, shy, and very deprecating. Her voice, a sweet little voice, was rather unsteady as she spoke. \" I hope you won't think it very rude of me"], [329, "SO AS BY FIRE 325 to come and see you like this,\" she said hur riedly. \" I \u2014 wanted so much to come.\" There was a perceptible pause while the elder woman looked down into the girlish face with searching, gleaming eyes. Then Mrs. Neale turned abruptly and silently, and led the way into the sitting-room. With her eyes fixed once more on her visitor, she motioned towards a chair. \" You've\u2014 heard about me, I suppose ? \" she said. There was a hard sneer in her voice, though whether directed against herself, her visitor, or some third person, it would have been hard to say. Sylvia Marsden flushed deeper. Her eyes were very brave as she looked back into the dark face, and there was a pity in them which she could evidently no longer suppress. \" Yes,\" she said softly. \" Don't be vexed, please ; I \u2014 am so very, very sorry ! That's why I couldn't help coming.\" There was about the girl an unconscious recognition of the woman's superior power, a tacit oblivion of their relative relations as"], [330, "326 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS young lady and village school-mistress, which was an eloquent tribute to that mysterious something about Mrs. Neale which even degradation, as it seemed, could not destroy. The wistfulness in the girlish voice was the tentative appeal of girlhood to unhappy womanhood. The tone seemed to affect Mrs. Neale vaguely. She moved restlessly. \"It is kind of you to be sorry,\" she said, and the sneer in her voice had lost its genuine ring. Into Sylvia Marsden's eyes there rose two great, bright tears. \" Oh, don't take it like that ! \" she said en treatingly. \" As if I meant to be horrid ! I've heard so much about you. Maurice \u2014 Mr. Drury has said so much ! Last night he couldn't say enough.\" \" Really.\" The word fell sharp and sudden, and as though it had an edge of steel, and Sylvia Marsden clasped her hands nervously. \" Don't be angry about that ! \" she said. \" I -I asked him ; and he was so dreadfully"], [331, "SO AS BY FIRE 327 distressed and upset, and every one in Abbots Corton is so hard and horrid, he says, that I think it was a relief to him to talk to me!\" The expression in the dark eyes was very strange to see, as Mrs. Neale looked at Sylvia Marsden, for a moment, without speaking. Then she said slowly ; \" And what did\u2014 Mr. Drury\u2014 tell you ? \" \" He told me \" \u2014 the girl leaned timidly forward \u2014 \" he told me how clever you are, and how you and he have been such great friends ! And he told me \u2014 oh, don't be vexed \u2014 he told me how wonderful you have been, and how \u2014 how sad it all is.\" \" Nothing more ? \" \" No, nothing more.\" A moment's silence ensued on the girl's rather wondering answer. Then Mrs. Neale rose abruptly and began to walk up and down the narrow space. The fierce struggle was rising in her eyes again, and they looked away into nothingness. \" I should like to tell you something about"], [332, "328 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS my life,\" she said harshly. \" I was a farmer's daughter, and, for my curse I suppose, I was not like other farmers' daughters ! Even as a young girl I had all sorts of tastes, and feelings, and ambitions, with which a farmer's daughter has no business ! Because I was supposed to be ' clever ' I was apprenticed as a pupil-teacher \u2014 trained up for a school mistress ; and I loathed my life and my surroundings.\" She stopped, catching her breath sharply. \"Of my girlhood, I can safely say that there was not a day or an hour in it when I was happy or content. At three-and-twenty I married ; I married a gentleman. He ran away with me, took me to London, and in troduced me to his set. It was a good set, and he was not very popular in it ; he was \u2014 well, never mind what he was ! And his ac quaintances would not take to me ! I was not born to be snubbed, unfortunately, and I conquered some sort of standing for myself; but I made no friends. And when my hus band committed suicide to escape conviction"], [333, "SO AS BY FIRE 329 for forgery, I \u2014 gave it up ! I fell back on \u2014 my profession,\" this with a harsh laugh. \" I retired to Abbots Corton, and spoke to nobody from week's end to week's end but village children and village parents ! \" She broke off with a gesture of ineffable disgust, and then turned suddenly upon Sylvia Marsden. \" Of my womanhood as of my girlhood,\" she said, \" I say truly that it has known no happiness. None ! none ! I'm only two-and thirty now ! Haven't I a right to such con solation as I can make for myself? Tell me, you happy little girl, haven't I the right, at all costs ? \" Her manner was so wild, her tone rang with a passion so strangely disproportionate to the apparent drift of her words, that Sylvia Marsden shrank back for the moment, startled and bewildered. Then the soft young face twitched and quivered all over, and the girl burst into an agony of tears. \" Oh, poor thing ! \" she sobbed. \" Oh, poor thing ! poor thing ! If I could only do any thing for you ! If I could only help you"], [334, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 330 anyhow, anyhow ! Oh, what a cruel world it is ! What a cruel, cruel world ! \" \" We must take care, then, how we add to its cruelty ! \" Slow and grave, with a singular far-away softness in them, the words came, after a long pause, from the still, woman's figure, which had stood as though suddenly turned into marble, with its sombre eyes fastened upon the sobbing girl. As Mrs. Neale spoke, Sylvia Marsden checked her tears with an effort and raised her head to meet those eyes, from the still depths of which a great quiet seemed to be stealing over the woman's worn, passion-marred features. As though its ex pression influenced her in spite of herself, the girl also grew calmer. \" I \u2014 I'm ashamed ! \" she whispered. \" But \u2014 it is so sad ! \" The faintest ghost of a smile touched Mrs. Neale's lips into a beauty which Sylvia Mars den saw for the first time. She moved a little nearer to the still trembling figure, and put both hands on the girl's shoulders."], [335, "SO AS BY FIRE 331 \"You are very fond of Mr. Drury!\" she said. Then, as the girl answered only with a vivid wondering blush, she added gently \u2014 \" And you will make him a good wife. Good-bye, Miss Marsden. Thank you for coming.\" On Friday afternoons, at half-past four, it was the custom of the Vicar of Abbots Corton to receive in person, in the girls' school-room, subscriptions to the coal club. The institution was a popular one, the personal attendance of the Vicar being a great feature ; but it had never before been so largely attended as on this particular Friday. The Reverend Maurice Drury ran the gauntlet of those dozens of curious eyes, as he had run the gauntlet of two pairs of eyes on another occasion some six weeks before, in absolute unconsciousness. But this time it was the unconsciousness of intense preoccupa tion. He sat behind his table, his face white and haggard, going through his business before him with that rigid concentration of manner which argues a fierce struggle with"], [336, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 332 importunate extraneous thought. The plea sant air of priestly leisure, usually so character istic of him, was gone. His tone and gesture and expression were brief, business-like, and stern. The work was rapidly disposed of under these circumstances. By half-past five, the last straggler disappeared through the door. Left alone, the Vicar sat for a moment motion less, the numbness of reaction creeping over his face. Then, as though that importunate thought had forced an entrance through the stillness, his features gradually contracted as if with grinding, relentless suffering. He rose, the strong compression of his lips contradicted by the haunted wretchedness of his eyes ; put away the books and papers by which he was surrounded, and turned out all the gas. Then he paused, staring down into the fire. Me chanically, and almost unconsciously, as it seemed, he rested his arm on the narrow mantelpiece, and the next moment his face had fallen forward upon his arm. Maurice Drury's defences were broken"], [337, "SO AS BY FIRE 333 down. He had entrenched himself in a fic- titious security ; he had looked out on life through a false medium ; and now the time had come when all that was unreal and untrue in his mental environment had shrivelled into nothingness, and he found himself struggling, helpless and overwhelmed, in a raging sea of fact. With the sudden horror of realization which had arrested his passionate declaration to Mrs. Neale on the previous evening, the very foundation of his world, spiritual and mental, had been upheaved. The unexpected arrival of Sylvia Marsden \u2014 the result of a long-conceived plan of Mrs. Bearne's\u2014 could hardly add to, though it complicated his agony. He, the representative of the priest- hood, had fallen as other men fall, the victim to his own uncontrolled impulses. He had mistaken the fascination of a woman for the fascination of a penitent. He was the torn and tortured victim of irreconcilable desires. Five minutes passed, ten minutes, and still he did not move. Then there fell a light"], [338, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 334 touch on the handle of the door. It failed to disturb him. The door opened. He lifted his head with a start, to see Mrs. Neale coming slowly towards him. The only light in the great bare school-room was the flickering light of the fire, and as it played fitfully upon the forms and desks, casting weird shadows, it seemed rather to conceal than to reveal her figure. She came close up to the fire-place and paused, silently scanning the face with which Maurice Drury had waited for her, motionless ; scanning, in the light of a sudden flame, all the agitation, the struggle, the agony that spoke in every line. Then the faint shadow of a smile touched her pale lips. \" I thought you were still here,\" she said quietly. \" I want to speak to you.\" He made no answer by word or sign, only gazed into her face, and she went on, with hardly a pause ; \"You asked me yesterday what caused \u2014 what happened on Wednesday, and I would not tell you. It was this : Mrs. Bearne came"], [339, "SO AS BY FIRE 335 to see me on Wednesday afternoon, to warn me that your kindness to me was the gossip of the village ; that our intimacy could not go on without developing into a scandal, and that, on the whole, it was more than time that I removed my disgraceful and contaminating presence from the village.\" She stopped. Into Maurice Drury's face, as the drift of her words became evident, there had leaped a sudden flash of incredulous horror ; a flash which had died down again into a heavy acceptance of an added weight of misery. Slowly on the struggle and agony of his expression there was forming a despair ing self-reproach, which changed its whole character as nothing else could have done. His dry lips parted impulsively, but before the words became audible she spoke again, rather quickly. \" I was taken by surprise,\" she said. \" I ought to have known better ! I ought to have known that it must be so ; but \u2014 I had never once thought of it.\" She paused a moment, and then went on in a quick, matter-"], [340, "336 SOME WOMEN'S WAYS of-fact way. \" It \u2014 upset me. It brought me face to face with \u2014 things that I did not want to face, and I was not strong enough. But what happened on Wednesday night has at least saved me the trouble of a decision ! You must dismiss me now \u2014 you cannot help your self. So \u2014 I am going to resign.\" \" Yes ! \" Maurice Drury was standing erect, one hand grasping tightly at the mantel piece. His face was drawn, and his eyes were burning. A livid agony of conscious self-con viction, self-degradation, was stamped on every feature, dominating even the passion with which they struggled. \" Yes, you shall resign ! I am responsible for all that has happened. I love you \u2014 God forgive me for it ! You shall not suffer. You shall not \u2014 lose yourself, perhaps \u2014 while I can put out a hand to help you. You are more to me than my honour ! Be my wife ! \" The hoarse voice, trembling and vibrating with passion, rang through the room ; its last quivering echoes died away, and then there came upon the dead silence the sound of a"], [341, "SO AS BY FIRE 337 long, tremulous, sighing breath, half ineffable joy, half ineffable pain. Mrs. Neale had fallen back a step, her hands tightly pressed together, her face a little lifted, a light and a glow in every line, her eyes beautiful as they had never been before. She stood so, motionless, for perhaps a moment ; and then she slowly shook her head. \" No ! \" she said softly. Maurice Drury took two fierce steps towards her, and stood over her. Something in her face alone seemed to prevent his taking her roughly into his arms. \" Why not ? \" he said vehemently. \" We \u2014 love one another ! It is because you think I'm bound in honour elsewhere? Honour! I have no honour, whichever way I turn ! If I keep faith with \u2014 her, I have acted like a brute and a coward to you !

In time \u2014 ah, in such a little time \u2014 I should be to you only an incarnate temptation to which you had yielded ! \" Before the intense conviction in her eyes, before the steady tones of her unfaltering voice, Maurice Drury wavered. The passion began to fade from his face, the tense con centration of his figure slackened, and he fell back a step, his eyes still held by hers. \" You take it for granted that I love you ! \""], [343, "SO AS BY FIRE 339 she went on, and her voice shook a very, very little. \"If that were so, do you think I would let you throw your life away \u2014 sacrifice your prospects, your position \u2014 for me?

But \u2014 there are other things that must go, too, for which you do care ! What would your precepts do if you had failed in example? What influence for good could you hope to exercise if you began like this ? How could you answer for the trust you would throw away ? \" He turned away from her at last with a stifled groan, and let his head fall forward on his arm. \" Example ! \" he muttered through his clenched teeth. \" My example ! \" There was a long silence. The face of the woman who watched him paled, and flushed, and paled again. Her eyes dilated and"], [344, "SOME WOMEN'S WAYS 340 contracted strangely. At last, without lifting his head, he said hoarsely ; \" What must I do ? \" \"You must marry the woman you love,\" came her answer ; \" and you must take up the life before you and live it strongly and tenderly ; live it all the more strongly and tenderly for having made a mistake.\" He raised his head and looked at her. \" And you ? \" he said thickly. \" You ?

It is full of incident, gives glimpses of the Peninsula war, takes us through France in 1813-14, describes an English election of the period, while the inter est culminates in the battle of Waterloo. The hero takes his part in the great fight, and is afterwards brought wounded to Brussels and laid in the street with some 50,000 companions ; an evil position from which he is bravely rescued by the heroine.

It is full, as stated, of haiv-bieadth escapes ; and though the great historical scenes then enacted in France are only incidentally alluded to, a fair reflex of the lawless state of the country at that period of its history is given. If the remaining volumes of the ' Fleur de Lys' series prove as interesting as this first one, they will assuredly form a very valuable addition to our book-shelves.\" The Dublin Freeman's Journal says: \u2014 \"There are many worse and few better stories to while away the idle hours pleasantly, to visit old times and strange scenes, and make new friends in the shining fairyland of fiction.\" JARROLD & SONS, 10 & n, WARWICK LANE, LONDON, E.C."], [354, "\"yiasfas of Homana\" %ms&.

She writes with ease and spirit, and there is not only brightness, but a good deal of unforced seeling, in her sketches.

Slight as the stories are, they are told with piquancy and point, whilst a pleasant vein of sentiment runs through the series.\" Winter's Weekly says: \u2014 \"All the stories are written in good, clear, simple language ; the style is clever and epigrammatic, and the characterisa tion very natural and life-like.\" The Literary World says : \u2014 \" Has the charm of rare originality because the author has a sympathetic appreciation of character and a broad-minded realisation of the fact that human nature in all its phases, if naturally drawn, is interesting; and all the more interesting when the picture is taken from an unconventional point of view.\" Wrecked at the Outset.
