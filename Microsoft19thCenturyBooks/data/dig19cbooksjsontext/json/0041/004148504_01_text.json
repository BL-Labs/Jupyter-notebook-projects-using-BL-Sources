The work has since been translated and published in Germany, by Mr. Frederick Muller of Friburg; but it has been long out of print in this country. The causes which have retarded the publication of a Third Edition it is unnecessary to mention : the delay has, I trust, been favourable to its appearance in a very im proved state ; as I have been collecting materials for it, during several years, having visited almost every situation of much geological interest in our own island, from the Land's End in Cornwall, to the Grampian Mountains in Scotland ; and passed part of three years in examining the geology of Savoy, Switzerland, and France. There is scarcely a rock formation described in the present volume, that I have not examined in its native situation, and com pared with the descriptions of former geologists. I have also had opportunities of examining the collec tions, and of profiting by the communications, of a2"], [10, "IV PREFACE TO some of the most eminent geologists on the Conti nent. While engaged in these pursuits, I have not been inattentive to the labours of other observers. So numerous and interesting are the discoveries made in geology during the last ten years, that in order to present a concise view of the science in its present advanced state, the Introduction to Geology has been recomposed, and all the Chapters are greatly enlarged. The following new Chapters have been added : \u2014 Chap. ii. On Fossil Organic Remains. Chap. iv. On the Principles of Stratification. Chap. x. A Re trospective View of Geological Facts. Chap. xvm. On the Destruction of Mountains; and on the Bones of Land Quadrupeds, found in Diluvial Depositions and in Caverns. Chap. xix. On the Formation of Valleys; and on Deluges and Denuda tions. \u2014 The Plates are new, except Plate iv. and part of Plate vii. The Outline Map of the Geo logy of England and Wales, was I believe, when published in the First Edition of 1813, the only geological map of England that had then appeared. It presents in one view the grand geological divi sions of the country, without delineating the differ ent strata in each division. Mr. Wm. Smith has since published a map of the Geology of England, which possesses extraordinary merit, \u2014 when it is considered as the unaided attempt of one person, to trace the course of each rock formation through"], [11, "THE THIRD EDITION. V England and Wales. Mr. Greenough, and other members of the Geological Society of London, have subsequently published a geological map of En gland and Wales. This map, from the great variety of its useful details, and its general correctness, may be regarded as the most complete exhibition of the geology of an extensive country, that has yet appeared. It was thought, however, that the pub lication of my Map in its original form, (or nearly so,) would be acceptable to those who wished to gain a general knowledge of the geology of their own country, without entering into geological details ; and that it would also serve as a useful introduction to the study of the above-mentioned maps. In the course of the present work, I have fre quently attempted to elucidate the geology of En gland, by comparisons with situations I have exa mined on the Continent, in order to connect the geology of our own island, with that of France, Switzerland, and Savoy. By comprising the numerous facts and observa tions contained in the present volume, within the limits of an elementary work, from the desire to be concise, I may have run the risk of becoming obscure : this I have studiously endeavoured to avoid; my chief aim being to present the reader with a system of Geology, which shall explain geo logical phenomena in a clear and intelligible man ner, and as free from technical obscurity as the"], [12, "VI PREFACE TO nature of the subject would admit. In order that the price may not exceed that of the last Edition, this work is printed in a smaller type. For any errors into which I may have inadvertently fallen, I would claim the candid indulgence of the reader, in the last words of that distinguished geologist Horace Benedict de Saussure, \" On peut 6tre utile, sans atteindre d la perfection.\" 1 shall conclude with some observations on the means of advancing geological knowledge. In a conversation I had with that experienced geologist Professor Brochant at Paris, on this subject, \u2014 he said: \"We are already sufficiently rich in facts, what is now wanting, is an accurate review of these facts : many geological descriptions, on which much stress continues to be laid, were written in an early state of the science, and require such corrections, as a comprehensive view of recent discoveries could scarcely fail to suggest. \u2014 I should recommend, Sir, that two active young men, competently instructed, should be sent out to examine all the most remark able situations described by former geologists, and to note down their observations on the spot. They should travel together, not only for the sake of mutual comfort and assistance, in the solitary situa tions they might have to visit, but in the examina tion of dubious phenomena, that the observations of the one might correct or confirm those ofthe other.\" \u2014These remarks of M. Brochant, which I have given as correctly as my memory and the difference"], [13, "THE THIRD EDITION. VII of language would allow, well deserve the attention of all Geological Societies*. What appears to me much wanted to clear up several dubious points in Geology, is a series of experiments, to ascertain the relative position and connection of certain rocks. This in some instances might be effected, by employing workmen to open out the edges of strata : other cases would require shafts to be sunk, and passages to be driven into the sides of mountains. Such experiments would be attended with expense; but they would reward us by the discovery of important facts, which must otherwise remain for ever unknown. * A Geological Map of France is at present in progress, under the direction of Professor Brochant.

IN tracing the progress of knowledge, we may frequently observe that the cultivation of particular branches of science at certain periods, was deter mined by causes which had little connection with their intrinsic utility. Fashion, caprice, and the authority of eminent names, govern mankind in philosophy, as well as on all Other subjects. But, independently of accidental causes, there are lead ing objects in the universe, which, as nations ad vance in civilization, seem naturally to direct their attention to certain sciences in succession. The brilliancy of the sun, moon, and planets, their va rious motions, and connection with the changing seasons, would first arrest the attention of the rude philosopher; nor need we wonder, that he soon began to regard them as endowed with life and intelligence, and attributed to them a mysterious power over human affairs : thus the heavenly orbs became the objects of religious adoration ; and curiosity, hope, and fear, lent their aid to the early cultivation of astronomy."], [15, "IX PREFACES TO THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS, Mathematics and mechanical philosophy are so intimately connected with astronomy and the most useful arts, that they naturally claimed the second place among the early sciences. The branches of philosophy which comprise a knowledge of the physical qualities of matter, or such as are perceptible by the senses, follow next ; and at a later period, chemical philosophy or that science which endeavours to ascertain the elemen tary substances, of which all material objects are composed. In the order of succession, mineralogy and geology are the last of the natural sciences ; for though an acquaintance with the earth is more important to man than a knowledge of the distant parts of the universe; yet, previously to the cultiva tion of the other sciences, and of chemistry in par ticular, our knowledge of the mineral kingdom could not extend much beyond that of the rudest periods. Thus we find that notwithstanding the precious metals, and many of the mineral treasures which the earth contains, have been the objects of insatiable cupidity in every age, yet, till the pre sent day, almost all that was known of mineralogy, was confined to uneducated working miners. In looking over the pages of history, we may observe that the most polished nations of antiquity had scarcely advanced beyond a limited acquaint ance with astronomy, geometry, and mechanical philosophy. In modern Europe, all the natural sciences, geology and mineralogy excepted, have"], [16, "X PREFACES TO THE been successfully cultivated, and their progress has been astonishingly rapid ; but till about the middle of the last century, the structure of the earth had scarcely engaged the attention of philosophers. Near that time, Lehman, the German, first ob served that there are certain rocks which occupy the lowest relative situation in different countries, and that these rocks contain no organic remains : hence he gave them the name of primary, and established a division between them and the rocks by which they are covered, in which the remains of animals or vegetables frequently occur : the lat ter he called secondary. In our own country, the Reverend J. Michel!, was the first person who ap pears to have had any clear views respecting the structure of the external parts of the earth : they were made public in a valuable paper on the cause of earthquakes, in the Philosophical Transactions, 1759. About twenty years afterwards, Mr. John Whitehurst published his \" Inquiry into the origi nal State and Formation of the Earth.\" His ob servations were principally confined to the rocks and strata of Derbyshire. Independently of its speculative opinions, this work was highly valuable, as an attempt to describe the geology of a district, from actual examination. The great variety of original information it contained, and its general accuracy, will remain a lasting monument of the writer's industry and ability. Mr. Whitehurst, however, fell into the same error with the cele-"], [17, "FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS. XI brated Werner in Saxony, an error to which the first cultivators of geology were particularly ex posed, \u2014 that of drawing general conclusions from local observations, and forming universal theories from a limited number of facts. Though Mr. Whitehurst's book was favourably received, yet till the beginning of the present cen tury geological pursuits made little progress in En gland. On the continent, the researches of Saus sure, Pallas, Werner, St. Fond, Dolomieu, and others, had before this time produced a powerful interest, and brought into the field many active and enlightened inquirers. The first general impulse given to the public taste, for geological investiga tions in this country, was produced by Professor Playfair's luminous and eloquent illustrations of the Huttonian theory. The leading feature of this theory, that all rocks or strata have been either formed or consolidated by central subterranean fire, was very warmly opposed ; and much personal animo sity and many adventitious circumstances were as sociated with the contest, not highly honourable to philosophy, but well calculated to keep alive the attention of the disputants, to those appearances in nature, which favoured or opposed their different theories. He who attempts to make a scientific subject familiar, runs the risk in this country of being deemed superficial : a plentiful share of dullness, combined with a certain degree of technical pre-"], [18, "XII PREFACES TO cision, are regarded as essential proofs of pro fundity. By prescriptive right, long established in these realms, dullness and pedantry guard the por tals of the temple of Science, and command those who enter, to avert their eyes from whatever can elevate the imagination, or warm the heart, and to look at nature through a sheet of ice. In com pliance with their authority, writers of introductory treatises, have generally thought it necessary to avoid that felicity in the familiar illustration of scientific subjects, so conspicuous in some of the elementary works of our neighbours. Without venturing to depart too far from established usage, I have endeavoured to render geology more intel ligible, by avoiding as much as possible theoretical and technical language, and by introducing a sim ple arrangement, suited to the present state of our knowledge. The local illustrations from various parts of our island, with the drawings, sections, and map in the present volume, will I trust facilitate the study of geology, and prove particularly acceptable to those who are entering on these inquiries : at the same time, I flatter myself with the hope, that the original information this work contains, respect ing the geology and natural history of England, will secure it a candid reception. \u2014 Edition of 1813. Several have been deterred from the study of geology by the supposed difficulty of learning its attendant science, mineralogy ; but an acquaintance with the nice distinctions made by many modern"], [19, "THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS. XIII mineralogists, is not necessary to gain a knowledge of the structure and arrangement of the great masses of matter that environ the globe, nor of the substances of which they are composed. He who would gain a useful knowledge of geology, would do well to provide himself with specimens of com mon rocks, and the simple minerals of which they are composed, and examine their external charac ters and physical properties, comparing them with the descriptions given by the best mineralogical writers. Fortunately these substances are not very numerous, and he may (without present inconve nience) omit the more rare crystallizations and va rieties, so much valued by cabinet philosophers ; for here, as in many other instances, the received value, is in an inverse ratio ofthe utility. The pe dantic nomenclature, and frivolous distinctions re cently introduced into mineralogy, may gratify vanity with a parade of knowledge ; but they are unconnected with objects of real utility, or with any enlarged views of nature. On hearing the various names which mineralo gists give to the same substance, and observing the avidity with which each new name is seized, as if it conveyed a hidden charm, the uninitiated might suppose, that he was \"journeying in the land of Shinar,\" and had fallen in company with a set of masons fresh from the tower of Babel, each one calling the same stone by a different name, and glorying in his absurdity.

The advice of Cicero to the cultivators of moral science, applies with peculiar force to the geologists and mineralogists of the present day. \" In these natural and laudable pursuits, two errors are par- ticularly to be avoided : the first, not to confound those things of which we are ignorant with those we know, or rashly to yield our assent without due investigation ; the second, not to bestow too much labour and study on obscure, intricate, and unpro- fitable subjects.\" \"In hoc genere et naturali et ho- nesto duo vitia vitanda sunt : unum, ne incognita pro cognitis habeamus, hisque temere assentiamur (quod vitium effugere qui volet adhibebit ad con- siderandas res et tempus et diligentiam).

When we examine the terrestrial globe, where the solid parts are uncovered and exposed to our view, we observe vast masses of rock or stone lying in apparent confusion on each other ; or, should we perceive some regularity in their position and ar rangement, we soon lose sight of it again by the intervention of other rocks. In this department of nature all seems vast, unshapen. and chaotic ; but let us not be discouraged, for we may recollect that the grandest objects in the material universe,, sel dom present to the hasty view of the superficial ob server, immediate proofs of order or design. The shepherd who first discovered that the pla nets were not fixed in the heavens, and noticed their apparently intricate wanderings among the stars, could not possibly anticipate the regularity and har monious simplicity of their movements, which sub sequent observations have demonstrated. Let us then endeavour to ascertain by what means we may become acquainted with the struc ture of the solid covering of our globe. Were these means bounded by the power of man to penetrate below the surface, our knowledge must ever remain very limited and imperfect; but natural operations have greatly facilitated our inquiries, and have broken the rocky pavement ofthe globe, and raised up or laid bare the mineral substances of which it is composed. By an attentive examination of the situations where the rocks and strata are thus ex posed to our research, we lay the foundation of the science denominated Geology. Geology is derived from two Greek words, yn \"the earth\" and Xoyog \"reason\", and signifies the Science"], [45, "3 speculative geology. of the Earth. Werner and his disciples, and also some of the French geologists, have changed the term into Geognosy ; but for this change no suf ficient reason can be assigned, and it is contrary to established analogies of language*. Philosophers in former ages, neglected the examination of the earth, and contented themselves with vain specula tions respecting its formation ; whereas the only proper answer to the question How was the world made ? is briefly this \u2014 \" By the almighty power of its Creator\". We may however be permitted, and indeed we are almost irresistibly impelled to inquire into the nature of the secondary causes, that have been operative in reducing the surface of our globe to its present state. This inquiry comprises what may properly be denominated Speculative Geology. Nor is this, as some assert, entirely useless : the advocates of particular systems have engaged in an active examination of nature to support their opi nions, and have \"compassed sea and land to gain proselytes :\" thus numerous facts have been disco vered, with which we should not have been ac quainted had they remained idle in their studies. The earth is now well known to be one of those globular bodies called planets, that revolve round the sun in orbits nearly circular, and in stated periods of time which bear a certain ratio to their respective distances from it. They turn round their axes with * Nothing can be more unmeaning than the apologies that have been offered for substituting yvuicric (gnosis ) \"knowledge,\" for _oyo. (.ogos) \"reason\". By the same rule we ought to change me teorology, physiology, &c. into meteorognosy, physiognosy, &c. b2"], [46, "4 FORM AND DENSITY OF different degrees of velocity ; and this motion ap pears to have had considerable influence on their external shape, by enlarging their equatorial dia meters ; they are not perfect spheres, but are more or less flattened at their poles. In the planet Jupiter, the velocity of the equa torial parts is more than four hundred miles per minute, whilst in the same time the equatorial parts ofthe Earth have moved only seventeen miles. A difference between the polar and equatorial diameter of Jupiter is perceptible with a telescope that has a distinct magnifying power of a hundred times, and it is ascertained to be as 12 to 13. The equatorial diameter of the earth exceeds its polar about tw enty seven miles ; the length of the equatorial diameter being 7927, that ofthe polar 7900 miles. The relative density of the sun, the earth, and of the other planets, is estimated by the attractive force which they exert on each other, as they move round their common centre of gravity. The absolute den sity or the quantity of matter contained in the earth, compared with an equal bulk of any known sub stance, may be nearly determined by the attractive force which any given mass of matter exerts upon a plummet (when suspended in its vicinity) to draw it from a vertical line. This will be proportional to the absolute quantity of matter in that mass com pared with that of the earth. By this method, it has been found that the mean density of the earth is about five times greater than that of water, or nearly twice the average density of the rocks and stones on the surface. Hence it may be inferred that the interior part"], [47, "THE EARTH. 5 of the earth is solid ; or, if it be cavernous, the solid matter must possess great density. It is not impro bable that iron, nearly in a metallic state, may be one of the constituent parts of the central mass, and to this it may owe its magnetic polarity. Dr. Halley has written a very ingenious paper in the Philosophical Transactions, to prove that the earth is a hollow sphere, in which there is inclosed a central magnetic globe, and by the motions of this globe the variations of the magnetic needle are pro duced. The celebrated French astronomer Laplace asserts that the nutation of the earth's axis, and ex periments on the vibration of the pendulum, indicate that the mineral beds of which our planet is com posed, increase in density as they approach nearer to its centre, at least to a certain depth from its sur face. There are, however, terrestrial ph\u00e6nomena, such as the rapid transition of motion to very distant parts of the earth's surface during violent earth quakes, which would render probable the existence of interior cavities filled with fluid or gaseous matter, and extending from one quarter of the globe to the other, and from the lower parts, to near the surface. It is evident that we have no means of verifying or invalidating hypotheses respecting the nature and structure of the central parts of the globe. The matter thrown up from vast and unknown depths by subterranean fires is similar to that of many rocks on the surface ; but we know not what changes it has undergone, or what substances were separated from it by fusion. It is, however, the study of the crust of the globe that is the proper occupation of the Geologist ; and"], [48, "6 PROPORTION OF HABITABLE LAND the greatest depth to which he can extend his ob servations from the uppermost strata, to the very lowest beds that have been raised up or laid bare by these natural operations which have formed moun tains or valleys, is less than eight miles ; a thickness which, compared with the bulk of the earth itself, does not exceed that of a coat of varnish upon an artificial terrestrial globe. Were we to bear this sufficiently in mind, the mighty catastrophes which have changed the surface of the globe in former periods, and have left traces of their action, appall ing to the imagination, would cease to exceed the sober measure of belief. The superficies of our planet is calculated to con tain about one hundred and ninety millions of square miles ; but could we be raised to a sufficient height above the earth, so as to have its whole en lightened hemisphere for our horizon, we might perceive as it revolved under our feet, how small a portion is fitted for the habitation of man. More than three fifths of the earth's surface are covered by the ocean; and if from the remaining part we deduct the space occupied by polar ice and eternal snow, by sandy deserts, steril mountains, marshes, rivers and lakes, the habitable portion will scarcely exceed one fifth of the whole of the globe. Nor have we reason to believe that at any former pe riod, the dominion of man over the earth was more extensive than at present. The remaining four fifths of our globe, though untenanted by mankind, are for the most part abundantly stocked with ani mated beings, that exult in the pleasure of existence, independent of human controul, and no way sub-"], [49, "to the surface of the globe. 7 servient to our necessities or caprice. Such is and has been for several thousand years the actual con dition of our planet ; nor is the consideration fo reign to our subject, for hence we may feel less reluctance in admitting the prolonged ages or days of creation, when numerous tribes of the lower orders of aquatic animals lived and flourished, and left their remains imbedded in the strata that com pose the outer crust of our planet. The ocean has been an important agent in effect ing vast changes on the surface of our globe, which will be afterwards considered. The average depth ofthe sea has been differently estimated ; according to Laplace this depth cannot be less than ten miles, to account for the height of the tides by the laws of gravitation. No admeasurement by soundings has exceeded the depth of one mile and a quarter. The ocean has not always been confined in its present bed, for rocks almost entirely composed of the shells or remains of marine animals, are found in almost every country that has yet been explored, and these remains occur near the summits of the highest mountains, in the old and new continents, some of which rise more than two miles above the present level of the sea. It is well known that the water of the sea con tains a considerable portion of common salt, and a small portion of other saline ingredients *. The average amount of salt in the ocean may be esti- * The inquiry has often been made,\u2014 whence did the sea derive its saline contents ? It has been supposed by some writers that"], [50, "8 DISCOVERY OF LEHMAN. mated at 2| per cent of common salt and \u00a3 per cent of other saline compounds. The atmosphere which surrounds the earth does not come under the attention of the geologist, ex cept as an agent in wearing down the surface by moisture and change of temperature. The inequalities of the earth's surface formed by mountains and valleys, afford frequent opportuni ties for observing that the mineral substances of which it is composed, are of different kinds : in some situations we observe strata of chalk ; in others, of sandstone or limestone, or beds of slate, granite, &c. It was long known to working miners, that the dif ferent beds of mineral matter lay over each other in a regular order in certain districts, and that certain beds were always found under and never above other particular beds. The first geological observation which may be said to have laid the foundation ofthe science, was made by the German Lehman. He found that the lower rocks in some of the mining districts were distinguished from the upper rocks by their great hardness and by their structure, which was for the most part either crystalline or slaty ; they were also distinguished by the absence of shells and other the salt in the sea has been gradually augmented by saline particles brought into it by rivers ; but this cause is totally inade quate to explain the immense quantity of salt existing in the whole mass of the ocean. If the average depth of the sea be ten miles, and it contain 2_ per cent of salt, \u2014 were the water en tirely evaporated, the thickness of the saline residue would ex ceed one thousand feet ; and were this removed and spread over all our present continents, it would form a stratum of solid rock salt more than half a mile in thickness."], [51, "9 DISCOVERY OF LEHMAN. organic remains, and by the absence of fragments of other rocks which occur so frequently in the upper rocks or strata. He further observed that many of the upper strata, besides containing organic remains, appeared to have been formed of fragments of the lower rocks, broken down and agglutinated together ; and hence he inferred, that the lower rocks were formed prior to the creation of animals, and he gave them the name oi Primitive or Primary, and distinguished the upper by the name of Se condary. This grand division, though too hastily formed, was of use in the infancy of the science, and induced geologists to examine more attentively the nature and position of the rocks in different countries : and as their observations became more extended and accurate, a more extended arrange ment and classification was found necessary. Many of the earlier geologists maintained, that each bed or stratum of rock is extended universally over the globe, and that a series of beds in regular succes sion environs our planet like the coats of an onion. This position is, however, much too general, as many beds of rock which are common in one coun try, are entirely wanting in another ; but taken as an illustration of the structure of the crust of our globe over a limited extent, the successive coats of an onion, if they were of different colours, might not unaptly represent the different strata that cover certain districts. It may here also be proper to observe, that the different strata which occur under each other are not arranged in the order of their density or specific gravity. Coal strata, for instance, are often covered"], [52, "10 CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS. with strata of iron-stone, the specific gravity of which is more than twice that of coal. I shall now proceed to enumerate the different classes of rocks generally admitted by geologists, and briefly describe the principal characters of each class ; and in order to direct the attention of the reader more forcibly to the subject, I shall trace on an outline map the principal situations in our own island, where rocks of each class occur, except the recent volcanic. All the different rocks and strata that cover the earth's surface may be arranged under the follow ing classes : \u2014 1. Primary. 2. Intermediate or Transition. 3. Secondary ; comprising The Lower Secondary Series, and The Upper Secondary Series. 4. Tertiary. 5. Basaltic and Volcanic. C. Diluvial and Alluvial Ground*. This arrangement is substantially followed by most geologists of the present day, though with some modification of the names. Several of the French * Though the summits of Mont Blanc and many of the highest mountains in the southern chain of the Alps are granitic, the summits of the Jungfrau and the highest mountains in the northern chain of the Alps are generally composed of secondary strata covering the granite. In England and Wales the highest mountains are covered by rocks of the transition class, aud the granitic or other primary rocks appear only near their bases. In Scotland some of the highest mountains are composed of rocks of the primary class."], [53, "PRIMARY ROCKS. 11 geologists class the lower secondary, including the coal strata, with the intermediate or transition rocks : some urgent reasons may be advanced for adopting this arrangement, which we shall subsequently notice. Primary or Punitive Rocks \u2014 were so called be cause no fossil remains of animals or vegetables, nor any fragments of other rocks were found im bedded in them : hence it was supposed that they were formed prior to the creation of organic beings. The rocks of this class are for the most part ex tremely hard, and the minerals of which they are composed are frequently more or less perfectly crystallized. These rocks generally occur in im mense masses or beds ; they form the lowest part of the earth's surface with which we are acquainted, and they not only constitute the foundation on which rocks of the other classes are laid, but in many si tuations they pierce through the incumbent rocks and strata, and form also the highest mountains in alpine districts. We are not to conclude, when we see a mountain or range of mountains bounded by a plain, that the mineral beds and strata of which these mountains are formed terminate at their ap parent bases ; on the contrary, they dip under the surface at angles more or less inclined, stretching below the lower grounds and hills, and often rising again in remote districts. That primary rocks environ the whole globe will not admit of direct proof; but, from their frequent occurrence in mountainous districts in the most distant parts ofthe world that have been examined, we may infer that some of the rocks of this class"], [54, "12 TRANSITION ROCKS. constitute the foundation rock of every country. We have no means of ascertaining that the similar rocks of distant districts were formed at the same time, nor can we be certain that the rocks called Primary have not once contained organic remains that were destroyed during the process by which they acquired their present crystalline structure. We may however, with apparent probability, infer that their formation was prior to the existence of animals or vegetables on our planet in its present state, because the rocks which immediately cover them contain almost exclusively the organic remains of the lowest class of animals, which are considered as forming the first link in the chain of animated beings. On this account these rocks have been called by the German geologists transition rocks, from the supposition that they were formed when the world was passing from an uninhabitable to a habitable state. Transition or intermediate rocks are generally less crystalline than the primary ; they containing occasionally organic remains of thc lower classes of animals, and also fragments of rocks of the preceding class. They are frequently inter posed between rocks of the primary class, and those more generally called secondary, and often partake of the character belonging to both. The rocks of the primary and transition class are the principal repositories of metallic ores, but in Europe they contain few saline or inflammable minerals*. In South America, according to Humboldt, sulphur % Except we comprise coal strata in the transition series."], [55, "SECONDARY ROCKS. 13 and bitumen exist in considerable quantities in rocks denominated primary. Rocks ofthe transition class are not universally in terposed between the primary and secondary rocks, for in some situations the transition series are en tirely wanting: thus in passing from Lyons to Cler mont in the centre of France, I observed the re gular coal strata restingupon a bed of sand, clay, and rounded stones, which immediately cover granite. Secondary Rocks. \u2014 The lower series are almost all distinctly stratified; they consist chiefly of sand stone, soft argillaceous slate called shale, and beds of coal and iron-stone. Many of the secondary strata of this class abound exclusively in the fossil remains of vegetables, analogous to ferns, palms, and reeds ; while the rocks in the former or trans ition class, contain exclusively the remains of ma rine animals, they occur principally in limestone. This change in the nature of the fossil remains in the two classes of rocks, indicates an important change in the condition of the globe, prior to the deposition of the lower series of secondary strata. The transition rocks were evidently formed under the sea, some of the beds being almost entirely composed of the exuvi\u00e6 of madrepores and encrini, while the vegetable remains in the secondary strata would appear to indicate that they had grown in marshes or fresh-water lakes, covering the surface where the sea had formerly flowed. The upper series of secondary rocks indicate another most important revolution of the globe. The prevailing rocks of this series are stratified limestone, with beds of clay, shale, and sandstone"], [56, "14 SECONDARY ROCKS. interposed. The organic remains in these strata are chiefly those of marine animals, but of different genera and species from those in the lower rocks. It is in rocks of this series that we first meet with remains of animals of a higher class, which pos sessed a brain and spinal marrow ; but these verte brated animals are all of the oviparous order, such as fish, or the saurian or lizard tribe. Some of these saurian animals were of immense size, greatly exceeding in length and bulk any saurian animals now existing. Another important fact respecting the upper series of secondary strata is, that they appear to have been formed not only under different circum stances from the lower, but after a long interval, during which the surface of the globe had been much fractured and displaced ; for the upper series do not lie regularly upon the other, and parallel with them, but they cover the edges of the lower strata unconformably. To make this better understood, suppose a num ber of books to be laid regularly upon each other, and the lowest volume to be tilted up so as to give an inclined position to the whole, if we then take other books and place them horizontally, or nearly so, on the upper edges of the inclined volumes, we may then form a distinct idea of the position of the upper series of secondary strata over the lower se ries. This position will be more fully described in the 4th chapter. The last of the upper secondary strata is chalk, a rock well known in the south and south-east parts of England, though entirely want ing in the north-west and in Scotland."], [57, "TERTIARY AND VOLCANIC. 15 Tertiary Strata \u2014 comprise all the regular beds that have been deposited subsequently to the chalk strata, on which they frequently repose. It was formerly supposed that tertiary strata were very limited in extent, and were confined to a few districts in Europe ; recent observations, however, prove that strata of this class cover considerable portions ofthe surface in various countries, though there are other countries in which they are entirely wanting. Tertiary strata are the last formed or uppermost of all the regular rock formations. They consist chiefly of clay, limestone, and friable sand stone : the lower series of these strata contain nu merous marine shells, while some of the middle and upper strata contain shells resembling those found in our present rivers or in fresh-water lakes. The most remarkable fact respecting the tertiary strata is, that some of them contain numerous bones of quadrupeds of the class Mammalia, but these for the most part belong to genera and species which no longer exist upon the earth. Volcanic and Basaltic Rocks \u2014 have been either ejected from volcanoes, or poured out in a state of fusion from rents andopeningson the earth's surface. They cover in an irregular manner the rocks of the preceding classes. In some situations the melted mineral matter has taken a columnar form in cool ing ; in other situations it fills vast fissures, called by miners \u2014 dykes. Basaltic rocks are very common in the northern part of our island. Diluvial and Alluvial. \u2014 Considerable portions of the surface of the ground are in many countries covered with thick beds of sand or clay, and frag-"], [58, "16 DILUVIAL AND ALLUVIAL. ments of rock and loose stones, more or less round- ed by attrition : in some situations these have evi- dently been transported from a vast distance, for frequently no rock similar to the fragments occurs within a hundred miles, or more, ofthe place where they are deposited. They indicate the action of mighty inundations, which have swept over the face of our present continents. The French have given to these depositions the name of terreins de transport, a name which defines them precisely, and comprises both diluvial deposits formed sud- denly by mighty irruptions of the ocean, and allu vial deposits formed by the gradual deposition of sediment at the mouths of rivers or in lakes. The classes of rocks above enumerated have their appropriate mineral productions, and, with the exception of rocks of the first class, their appro priate organic remains ; and it would be as useless to search for regular beds of common coal in the primary rocks, as it would be to search for metallic veins, or statuary marble, in the tertiary strata. I shall proceed to elucidate the situation of the different classes of rocks in England, by a reference to the outline map, Plate 6. If we trace a waving line a a a from the south west of Dorsetshire to the county of Durham, it will form a striking geological division of England : all the land on the east of this line is composed of the upper secondary and tertiary strata, in which neither metallic veins nor regular beds of mineral coal are found. The tertiary strata lie over the upper secondary within the parts bounded by the letters o o o o. On part of the eastern coast of"], [59, "MINERAL DISTRICTS OF ENGLAND. 17 Yorkshire and Lincolnshire there is a submarine forest about seventeen feet under the present high water level. This forest appears to have extended eastward, as stumps of trees and roots may be seen at low-water at a considerable distance from the coast. West of the line a a a there is an important change in the mineral productions; from thence to the line ecc the lower secondary strata appear, and most ofthe principal coal districts in England occur within the lines a a a and ecc. It is further remarkable, that few if any regular metallic veins are found in this division. The lower secondary strata are also continued west of the line ecc, through the midland and northern counties, but rocks of the transition series occasionally occur in this part of our island. A very extensive coal dis trict occurs in that part of South Wales bordering the Bristol Channel. On the east of the line c c c it may be remarked, that the strata generally incline or dip to the south-east ; west of this line they are more irregular, and dip in various directions. West of the part composed of the lower secon dary strata, and coloured green, we meet with rocks ofthe primary and transition classes, in which metallic ores occur; they constitute the alpine parts of England, passing through Cornwall and Devon shire, into North Wales, and the north-west parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, and through West moreland and Cumberland, into Scotland. This part is coloured red ; rocks of the primary class chiefly occur in the parts distinguished by dark lines. y c"], [60, "18 MINERAL DISTRICTS OF ENGLAND. Near the centre ofEngland, at Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, and at the Malvern Hills in Worces tershire and Herefordshire, the primary rocks pierce through the secondary strata, and compose two small districts of primitive country surrounded by secondary strata. Also in the counties of Derby shire and in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and part of Cumberland and Westmoreland, rocks of transition or mountain limestone rise to a consi derable elevation from beneath the secondary strata, which occur east and west of them ; some of these limestone mountains are rich in metallic ores. Along the line e e, beds of rock-salt and the prin cipal springs of brine are situated. It must be kept in mind when observing this map, that the tertiary strata lie upon the secondary, and the secondary upon the transition and primary rocks. Now, if the tertiary and secondary strata had both extended to the western counties, it is obvious that we could have had no knowledge of the existence of the lower series but by boring or sinking through the upper series ; and the ag gregate thickness of these, exceeds the power of the miner to pierce through. The tertiary strata, however, only cover a part of the secondary, and the secondary do not cover the whole of the lower series; so that in travelling westward, we come im mediately upon the lower strata in succession, as they rise from underneath each other; for, as I before observed, the general inclination or dip of the beds is towards the south-east. The action of the sea upon our coasts and cliffs has exposed to view the succession of the different rocks and strata in many"], [61, "CONTINENTS ONCE COVERED BY THE OCEAN. 19 parts of our island, and has enabled us to obtain a correct knowledge of their thickness and direction, and ofthe organic remains peculiar to each series. Before concluding the present chapter, let us take a view of some of the more striking appearances, which afford demonstrative evidence that great changes have taken place in the relative level of the present continents, and that the ocean has in former ages rolled its waves over what are now the most elevated parts of the earth. Many proofs of this exist in our own island, and in various parts of the world. The calcareous or limestone mountains in Derby shire, and Craven in Yorkshire, rise to the height of about two thousand feet above the present level of the sea. They contain through their whole extent fossil remains of zoophytes and marine animals, but more abundantly in some parts than in others. Particular species occupy almost exclu sively distinct beds, and in some situations the whole mass appears a compact congeries of mineralized organic remains. Over these vast beds of ancient limestone occur a series of sandstone strata and shale, containing almost exclusively remains of mineralized vegetables associated with beds of coal. Over this series we meet with other calca reous strata, containing remains of fish and enor mous reptiles of the saurian or lizard tribe, inter mixed with numerous species of bivalve and uni valve shells, but of different genera or species from those living in the present seas. Again, in the uppermost or tertiary strata, we meet with bones and teeth of land quadrupeds of the class Mam- c2"], [62, "20 CONTINENTS ONCE COVERED BY THE OCEAN. malia, some of which belong to unknown genera, and nearly all to unknown species. Among these are the bones of large animals, as the mastodon, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the gigantic tapir. These large animal re mains occur chiefly in beds of clay or gravel, or in caves. In the latter situation they are abundantly mixed with bones of smaller quadrupeds, of which the species no longer exist in England. The calcareous mountains of the Jura, and the outer range of the Alps, contain beds filled with the remains of marine animals, many of which I have examined, and found to be similar to those in the se condary strata in England. In the Alps they occur at the height of from six to eight thousand feet. Similar ph\u00e6nomena are observed in the calcareous mountains of the Pyrenees ; and according to Hum boldt, organic remains occur in the Andes, at the height of fourteen thousand feet. The distinct cha racters of the animals found in the upper and lower beds in these mountains, as well as in those of our own country, prove that they were not brought into their present situation by any sudden inunda tions, which would have mixed different orders of animals together. The beds which contain exclu sively the remains of animals of the same species, must have remained for ages under the ocean ; for these animal remains often compose nearly the whole substance of a bed of limestone of great thickness, as is the case with the beds of encrinal limestone in Derbyshire, and the limestone called coral-ragg at Steeple Ashton. The fossil remains of animals not now in exist-"], [63, "CONTINENTS ONCE COVERED BY THE OCEAN. 21 ence, entombed and preserved in solid rocks, pre sent us with durable monuments ofthe great revo lutions which our planet has undergone in former ages. We are carried back to a period when the waters of the ocean have covered the summits of our highest mountains, and are irresistibly com pelled to admit one of two conclusions, \u2014 either that the sea has retired and sunk far below its former level, or that some power operating from beneath, has lifted up the islands and continents, with their hills and mountains, from the watery abyss, to their present elevation above its surface. These organic remains present also undeniable proofs of another fact equally interesting. Every regular stratum in which they are disseminated, was once the uppermost rock, however deep it may be below the present surface, or with whatever rocks it may now be covered. This inference is not the less conclusive, whether we suppose that the ani mals lived and died where their remains occur, or whether they were aggregated and carried by ma rine currents into their present situation. Hence we learn that the secondary strata were formed in succession over each other, and thus these fossil remains preserve the records of the ancient condi tion of our planet, and the natural history of its earliest inhabitants. The unknown causes by which zoophytes and different genera and species of testaceous animals, of reptiles, vegetables, and mammiferous quadrupeds were buried in different strata, have operated in succession at distant inter vals of time ; for we do not find the remains of dif ferent classes confusedly intermixed together, ex-"], [64, "22 ORGANIC REMAINS. cept in beds of clay or gravel, near the surface, or in fragments of various rocks which have been broken down and subsequently united. Bones of vertebrated animals, or such as had a brain and spinal marrow, have never been found in the lower strata ; nor have the bones of the large mammi ferous quadrupeds ever been discovered below the chalk. Hence we acquire a perfect certainty, that the different beds which form the crust of our pla net, were deposited in distant epochs, and under different conditions of the globe. The animal re mains in some of the strata are so delicate, and so regularly deposited, that we can have but little doubt that the animals lived and died tranquilly where their remains are now found : in other strata below or above, the remains are broken, and the animals appear to have perished by some sudden convulsion. If the bones of man, or of mammiferous quadru peds resembling existing species, have casually been found with fossil remains peculiar to the lower or more ancient strata, I believe a careful examination of all the circumstances would generally explain the apparent anomaly. I shall state a remarkable fact of this kind, which came to my knowledge when engaged in a mineralogical examination for the Earl of Moira, in the vicinity of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in Leicestershire: it will evince how cautious we ought to be in drawing general conclusions in geo logy, from single facts. A thick bed of coal be longing to his lordship, at a place called Ashby Wolds, is worked at the depth of two hundred and twenty-five yards ; it is covered with various strata"], [65, "HUMAN BONES FOUND IN COAL. 23 of ironstone, coal, and solid sandstone. On an es tate adjoining to his lordship's manor, in the same bed of coal, (which is ninety-seven yards below the surface,) the entire skeleton of a man was found imbedded. No appearance existed of any former sinking for coal ; but the proprietor ordered pas sages to be cut in different directions, until the in dication of a former pit was discovered, though the coal had not been worked. Into this pit the body must have fallen, and been pressed and consolidated in the loose coal by an incumbent column of water, previously to the falling in of the sides of the pit. The imperfect skeleton of a woman, imbedded in a kind of calcareous sandstone, brought from Guadaloupe, and exhibited in the British Museum, may appear to invalidate what was asserted in the first edition of this work, that no instances have been known of human bones being found in re gular stratified rocks, nor even in undisturbed allu vial ground, where the remains of extinct species of quadrupeds are not unfrequently met with *. * Since the publication of the first and second editions of this work, I have seen in the possession of a gentleman at Plymouth, one of two human skulls that were found in digging a stream work forty or fifty feet below the level of the river at Carnon in Cornwall. Nuts, and the horns of some animal allied to the stag, were discovered in the same situation. \u2014 In a note I made at the time, 1816, it is stated that the forehead was remarkably low and narrow, and the part of the skull which contained the cere bellum unusually prominent. That these skulls were ancient there can be little doubt, but there is no sufficient data to enable us to approximate to the period of their deposition. The hone was not mineralized, though very hard. The absence or extreme rarity of human bones in these beds of gravel and"], [66, "24 HUMAN BONES IN SANDSTONE. Due attention to all the circumstances, will recon cile that assertion with the present fact. The ske leton from Guadaloupe is described as having been found on the shore below the high-water mark, among calcareous rocks formed of madrepores, and not far from the volcano called the Souffriere. The bones are not petrified, but preserve the usual con stituents of fresh bone, and were rather soft when first exposed to the air. Specimens of the stone which I have in my possession, that were chipped from the same block, present, when examined with a lens, the appearance of smooth grains consisting of rounded fragments of shells and coral aggregated and united without any visible cement. We have an example of a similar formation of calcareous sandstone on the north coast of Corn wall, composed entirely of minute fragments of shells. In the Arundel papers, there is mention of an inundation of sand, which covered a great part of the coast near St. Ives in the twelfth century : it is also known by oral tradition, that whole farms have been overwhelmed at a period not very re mote ; and at this very day, upon the shifting of the sands by high winds, the tops of houses may occa sionally be seen. In several parts of the coast, this sand is seen passing into the state of compact rock, very difficult to break ; and it is even used for build ing-stone. Entire shells of land snails and frag ments of slate occasionally occur in it *. When I clay, or in caves that contain the remains of large land quadru peds, is far more extraordinary than their non-occurrence in the regular strata that cover our present continents. * See Guide to Mount's Bay and the Land's End."], [67, "25 INSTITUTES OF MENU. was in the county I examined numerous specimens of the rock with a lens, and compared them with a specimen of the Guadaloupe sandstone that I had with me, and they appeared closely to resemble each other. Dr. Paris, in an interesting paper read to the Geological Society of Cornwall, ascribes the consolidation of the sandstone to the infiltration of water containing iron, from the decomposing slate rocks in the vicinity. Instances of consolidation of beds of loose sand are common on the coast of Si cily. It cannot therefore excite surprise, that in a volcanic island like Guadaloupe, subject to violent convulsions from earthquakes, and inundations, and impetuous hurricanes, human bodies should occa sionally be discovered, that have been enveloped in driving sands, which have subsequently become in durated. The situation of this skeleton near the sea shore, the state of the bones, and the nature of the stone in which they are imbedded, take away the probability of their high antiquity. In the Institutes of Menu, which according to Sir William Jones are at least as ancient as the writings of Moses, the account of the six days creation so closely resembles that given in Genesis*, that it is * The discoveries in astronomy which proved the diurnal and annual motions of the earth, were for some time warmly op posed, as being at variance with the motion of the sun and moon, and the motionless stability of the earth which the sacred writings describe. We should not however admire the judgement of the writer, who in the present day should publish a scriptural as tronomy, in opposition to the Copernican system. The sacred writers describe natural objects as they appear to the senses, and do not teach systems of natural philosophy."], [68, "26 INSTITUTES OF MENU. scarcely possible to doubt its being derived from the same patriarchal communication. There is, how ever, a particular definition given of the word day as applied to the creation, and it is expressly stated to be a period of several thousand years. If this in terpretation be admitted, it will remove the difficulty that some have felt in reconciling the epochs of creation with the six days mentioned by Moses. The six days in which Creative Energy renovated the globe and called into existence different classes of animals, will imply six successive epochs of inde finite duration. The absence of human bones in stratified rocks or in undisturbed beds of gravel or clay, indicate that man, the most perfect of terres trial beings, was not created till after those great revolutions which buried different classes and en tire genera of animals deep under the present sur face of the earth. That man is the latest tenant of the globe, is confirmed by the oldest records or tra ditions that exist ofthe origin of the human race. The great convulsions which have at distant pe riods changed the ancient surface of the globe, and reduced itfrom a chaotic to its present habitable state, were not, it is reasonable to believe, effected by the blind fury of tumultuous and conflicting elements, but were the result of determined laws directed by the same wisdom which regulates every part of the external universe. Compared with the ephemeral existence of man on the earth, the epochs of these changes may appear of almost inconceivable dura tion ; but we are expressly told, that with theCreator a thousand years are as one day, and one day as a thousand years."], [69, "27 CHAPTER II.

But this volume is now discovered ; it is the volume of Nature, rich with the spoils of primeval ages, unfolded to the view of the attentive observer, in the strata that compose the crust of the globe. The numerous and varied forms of organic beings, whose remains are there"], [70, "28 EARLY OPINIONS RESPECTING distinctly preserved, often differ so much in struc ture from any known genera of animals, that we can scarcely hazard any probable conjectures re specting their modes of existence. Nor is it merely the forms of unknown animals that we discover in the different strata, we also learn the order of suc cession in which they were created. It is only within a comparatively short period, that these fossil organic remains have engaged the attention of naturalists. It is true that in remote times, the occasional discovery of shells and bones of large animals imbedded in rocks did not escape the attention of philosophers ; but the shells were supposed to belong to species now living, and the bones to a gigantic race of men that perished du- ring some great inundation, or had been buried by earthquakes. Other hypotheses equally remote from truth, serve to show how little attention had been bestowed on this department of Natural Hi- story. The celebrated botanist,Tournefort, from the regularity of form in many fossil remains, was in- duced to believe that they were stones that grew and vegetated from seeds. \" How could the Cornu Ammonis,\" he observes, \" which is constantly in the figure of a volute, be formed without a seed containing the same structure in the small, as in the larger forms ? Who moulded it so artfully, and where are the moulds ?\" As fossil organic remains, particularly shells and zoophytes, are found many hundred and even thou sand feet below the present surface of the earth, the first inquiry that naturally suggests itself is, How did they come there ? It is impossible that the animals"], [71, "PETRIFACTIONS. 29 when living, or their exuvi\u00e6 when dead, could pass through such vast depths of solid rock. A few of them might fall into vertical fissures, and remain there*, but they could never in this way enter into strata almost entirely composed of organic remains. Beside, the strata now deep under the dry ground, are chiefly filled with the remains of marine animals; nor do we generally find these animal remains con fusedly aggregated ; different genera or species occupy particular strata, or are associated with cer tain genera or species of the same class, and never with others. It is therefore evident that they were not brought into their present situations by vast in- * Instances of oviparous reptiles found living in the midst of solid stone sometimes occur. At the colliery on Rothwell Haigh near Leeds, a living lizard or newt was found in a bed of coal at the depth of 180 yards from the surface. I saw it in the year 1819 soon after its discovery ; it was preserved in spirits, and was about five inches in length. I could not perceive that it differed from the living species. The animal had probably crept into the mine along one of the levels that drain off the water, or down the sides of the shaft. In all instances where toads have been found in solid stone, it is reasonable to believe that they en tered through fissures that have been subsequently closed. That these animals will live without food for a great number of years, is proved by the following circumstance. The late Sir Thomas Blacket, of Britton Hall in Yorkshire, had one cellar which was only opened once a year, as it con tained some particularly choice wine which was never brought to table but on the annual celebration of his birth-day, which was on the 21st of December, or St. Thomas's day. The butler when taking out the wine, observed a small toad crawling along the stone floor. He placed the toad under a wine bottle, and thought no more of it till he went into the cellar the following"], [72, "30 ON THE PROCESS OF PETRIFACTION. undations, and buried under the earthy matter which a subsequent inundation cast over them. Neither could zoophytes, fish, or large reptiles, or the inha bitants of bivalve or univalve shells, have lived and flourished in the midst of solid stone. We are there fore led to the conclusion, that each stratum which contains these organic remains was once the upper most covering of the globe, and that the animals for the most part lived and died near where their bones or shells are now found, and were covered by suc cessive depositions of strata, in which following races of living beings flourished, and in like manner left their remains. Animal or vegetable substances are found im- year, when on removing the bottle he was much surprised to see the toad immediately leap. This circumstance he mentioned to Sir Thomas, who descended with his visitors into the cellar to look at the toad ; after which the bottle was replaced, and the poor animal was kept a close prisoner till the succeeding year, when he was again uncovered and found alive as before. The same an nual experiment was continued for more than twenty-five years, when the wine was exhausted, the cellar cleared, and the toad, who was still living, was thrown out of doors. Having heard of this circumstance from a person who had lived in the family part of the time, I questioned the old butler respecting it, and he fully confirmed the truth of the story. It is much to be regretted that extraordinary facts relating to the natural history of animals should not be recorded immediately when they occur, otherwise they are soon forgotten, or are intermixed with fabulous additions which destroy the entire credit of the account. A few years after the death of the butler, I inquired of Mrs. Colonel Beau mont, the present highly intelligent possessor of the mansion, whether any written narrative of the above circumstance was preserved in the family ; but she told me that she had never heard of it, as the fact occurred during her infancy."], [73, "EXPERIMENT OF DR. JENNER. 31 bedded in rocks, and are more or less impregnated with mineral matter, and hence have been called petrifactions. The process of petrifaction consists in the infiltration of mineral matter into the pores of bone or vegetables. In some instances the ani mal or vegetable matter has been almost entirely dissolved or removed, and the mineral matter so gradually substituted, as to assume the perfect form of the internal structure either of the plant or animal. The process of petrifaction may be more rapidly effected than has generally been supposed. In the year 1817 I paid a visit to the celebrated Dr. Jenner, at Berkley, who informed me that he had made several experiments upon recent bones, by burying them in the dark mud from the lias clay : in less than twelve months the bones became black throughout, and when dry, they were harder, heavier, and more brittle than recent bone, and the surface was shining. The specimens which he showed me, presented the same appearance as the fossil bones in the lias clay. The effect was probably produced so speedily by the presence of the sulphate of iron, and other saline ingredients with which that stratum abounds. As this stratum is the most remarkable of all the secondary series, for the large animal remains which it contains, particularly ofthe saurian or lizard order, and as the bones are frequently covered with cry stals or incrustations of pyrites, I will venture to hazard a conjecture respecting the manner in which these crystals, or incrustations of pyrites, or sul phuret of iron, are formed. The stratum before mentioned, contains sulphate of iron or green cop-"], [74, "32 CONDITION OF ORGANIC REMAINS. peras in solution. I suppose that the carbon in the animal matter had decomposed the sulphuric acid and the oxide of iron, and that the sulphur and iron in their nascent state had united, and formed the sulphuret of iron or pyrites. I was led to this con clusion by reading an account by Mr. Pepys, of some mice which had by accident been immersed in a jar containing a solution of sulphate of iron : how long they had lain there was unknown; but the re mains were partly covered with small crystals of py rites, which could only have been formed in the manner above suggested. The stone surrounding the organic remains in the lias, I have observed to be considerably harder than the other parts of the same stratum. The organic remains of zoophytes and shells in limestone are generally harder than the stone in which they are imbedded ; and on this ac count, when the stone has been exposed to the atmo sphere a long time, the organic remains rise above the surface. Organic remains are generally coloured by the strata in which they are imbedded ; in roe-stone, chalk, and the upper fresh-water limestones, they approach to a yellowish or brownish white ; in lias, bituminous shale, and dark limestone, they in cline to black ; and the shells in bituminous shale are sometimes filled with bitumen in a fluid state. In the strata above chalk, the bones and shells re tain their original constituent parts very little changed; in chalk, and all the strata under chalk, the organic remains are more or less completely impregnated with mineral matter. The outer crust or shell of many chalk fossils is calcareous, and"], [75, "33 WESTBURY CLIFF. the internal part filled with flint. In some cases we meet with an internal cast formed in the cavity of a crustaceous animal, and the external covering has disappeared : in other instances, the shell or crust of the animal has formed a mould in the stone, into which mineral matter has been subsequently in filtered, and has thus made an external cast. It is particularly deserving attention, that some animal remains contain the most delicate fibres and spines, perfect and unbroken: thisproves that the mi- neral matter in which they are incrusted, was deposit- ed in a finely comminuted state, and in a tranquil sea. In some instances the most delicate shells are regu- larly arranged in the same position in which the ani- mals lived and died, while the animal remains in the strata above or below them are broken and con- fusedly aggregated together. The most remarkable instance of this kind I have ever observed, occurs at Westbury Cliff, on the northern bank ofthe river Severn, about seven miles below Gloucester. It is a low cliff, nearly perpendicular ; the lower part is composed of what is generally called red marie, over which are the lower beds of lias-limestone and clay. A few yards above the junction of the lias and red marie, there is a thin stratum of dark micaceous stone, entirely filled with bones and the teeth of the shark and animals of the saurian or lizard tribe, bioken and intermixed in the greatest imaginable disorder. Near the upper part ofthe cliff, not many feet above the stratum filled with bones, there is a thin stratum of whitish argillaceous limestone, called white lias, which is filled with the most delicate mi- D"], [76, "34 FOUR GRAND DIVISIONS nute bivalve shells, all arranged in the same posi tion, without any intermixture with shells of other species. It is facts like these that are particularly deserving the attention of the Geologist, as they mark in a striking manner the convulsions which the surface of the globe has at different periods undergone. The stratum with aggregated bones of saurian animals appears again, on the other side of the Severn, at Aust Passage, where the junction of the lias and red ground may be also observed ; but 1 could not discover any trace of the white lias bed with the bivalves, similar to those at Westbury Cliff. Some ofthe more delicately constructed animals, and the fish whose bodies are found entire, imbed ded in stone, appear to have been instantaneously destroyed and enveloped in mineral matter, before the putrefactive process could commence*. In tracing the different animal remains that occur in the lower, the middle, and the upper strata, the circumstance most worthy of notice, is the first appearance of any of the different divisions and classes of animals, and of the orders, genera, or species belonging to each division. In the lumi nous arrangement by Baron Cuvier in his Regne * In the Museum at the J ar din de Plantes in Paris, there is a large specimen of two fossil fish, which are supposed to have been destroyed and covered with mineral matter, when one of them was in the very act of swallowing the other ; but an inspection of the specimen inclined me to infer that the two heads had been pressed together, by the incumbent weight of stone deposited upon them."], [77, "OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM. 35 Animal, all animals are distributed, according to their organization, into four grand divisions \u2014 Ver tebrated, Moluscous, Articulated, and Radiated. lst, Vertebrated. \u2014 Animals which have a skull and spine containing the brain and the principal trunk of the nervous system, commonly called the spinal marrow : they have red blood. There is some analogy in the construction of all animals of this class, even in species the most remote; as man and the lowest species of fish. 2nd, Moluscous . \u2014 Animals with no internal ske leton; the muscles are attached solely to the skin, which is in many species covered with shells. The nervous system and viscera are composed of de tached masses, united by nervous filaments ; they only appear to possess the senses of taste and sight, and many species want the latter ; but they have a complete system of circulation, and particular organs for respiration. AH animals covered either by bi valve or univalve shells belong to this class. 3rd, Articulated. \u2014 To this class belong insects and worms : their nervous system consists of two long cords, ranging along the body, and swelling out in different parts into knots or ganglions. 4th, Radiated \u2014 comprises all the animals which were by former naturalists called zoophytes, or ani mal plants, as the corallines, &c. which were long mistaken for marine vegetables. In animals of this division, the organs of sense and motion are dis posed circularly around a centre or axis. They have no distinctly marked nervous system, and the traces of circulation in many species can scarcely be discerned. Many of the animals in this division have d2"], [78, "36 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC REMAINS no power of loco-motion, as madrepores and encri nites. Others, as the echinus, possess a very com plex organization, and the power of moving from place to place on their spines, which serve them for feet. In describing the order in which organic remains belonging to each of these grand divisions are di stributed through the different classes of rocks, it will be more convenient to begin with the lowest. Radiated Animals, such as encrini and madre pores, have left their remains abundantly dispersed through rocks of the transition series ; many of the strata appear almost entirely composed of their mineralized exuvi\u00e6, but generally in a broken state. The chain coral occurs occasionally in transition limestone. Other genera of radiated animals occur in the more recent formations of limestone, but sel dom in sufficient abundance to compose nearly the whole mass of a stratum. This is the more re markable, as coralline animals are forming exten sive calcareous rocks in our present seas. Some genera and species of radiated animals which abound in transition rocks, have not left their re mains in any ofthe upper strata. Hence it might be inferred that they were and had long been extinct; in some instances the inference is not correct : the Madrepora stylina, so common in transition lime stone, is entirely wanting in the secondary and ter tiary strata : but a living animal of this species has recently been discovered in the South Seas. The Pentacrinus, which is chiefly distinguished from the Encrinus by its pentagonal stem and branches, makes its first distinct appearance in the lias ; but is"], [79, "THROUGH THE LOWER AND UPPER STRATA. 37 not frequently met with in the upper strata, and dis appears entirely in the uppermost formations: hence it was long supposed that the species was extinct. A living Pentacrinus has recently been discovered in the West Indies, and its stem and branches in a perfect state have been sent to this country. The genus echinus makes its first appearance in the midstof the secondary strata; and various species are continued into chalk, which abounds with re mains of this animal in high preservation. It may be remarked, that scarcely any calcareous stratum exists abounding in marine organic remains, in which remains of some species of radiated animals may not be found. Articulated Animals. \u2014 Insects are rarely found with other organic remains, but one of the oldest inhabitants of the globe appears to belong to this division. It has in England been called the Dudley fossil, from being first noticed in the transition limestone near that town ; it has also been called the Trilobite, from the three parallel divisions of the body. Some of the species have been vulgarly named the fossil Butterfly, from a resemblance to the form ofthe wings and body of that insect. It appears to have been a crustaceous aquatic animal, with ranges of transverse ventral fins somewhat si milar to those under the belly of a lobster. The largest species of these animals is found in the slate quarries at Angers in France. A perfect specimen which I purchased at the sale of the late Faujas St. Fond, measures seven inches in length, the breadth is two inches ; the body has taken the flattened form, common to almost all fossils found in slate : it"], [80, "38 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC REMAINS scarcely rises more than one third of an inch above the surface of the slate ; the other side of the slate contains a perfect impression or mould ofthe form ofthe animal. To this species Guettard has given the name of Ogyges, from its occurrence among the most ancient rock formations that contain vestiges of organic life. The remains of insects are extremely rare in all the secondary strata in England, except in that anomalous formation at Stonesfield, where the sup posed elytra of coleopterous insects, or rather im pressions of them, occur. In the same strata, fos sil crabs are also found; and I have a specimen from the oolite near Kingscote in Gloucestershire, which appears to be part of the claw of a crusta ceous animal. In the soft beds in the tertiary strata, the remains of crabs are more common : but of all the four divisions of the animal kingdom, the Arti culated has supplied the smallest number of organic remains : this may be chiefly caused by the fragile nature of their bodies in most of the species, and their peculiar modes of existence. Moluscous Animals . \u2014 Shells, chiefly bivales, occur in the transition series ; but the species are not nu merous in this class. A few species of chambered univalves occur, but the individuals of each species are far from numerous. One or two species of unchambered univalve shells are said to have been found in transition limestone; they are, however, of extremely rare occurrence. In the secondary strata, the number of species and of individual bivalve shells is greatly increased ; and about the middle of the series, chambered spiral shells, nautilites and"], [81, "THROUGH THE LOWER AND UPPER STRATA. 39 ammonites, become abundant; and various species are continued into the chalk. The trochiform or top-shaped spiral shells first make their appearance in the strata above the lias; and different genera of univalve unchambered shells appear, and become abundant, in these strata. In the transition and secondary strata, all the genera and species of moluscous shells are commonly supposed to differ from those of animals at present existing. In the tertiary strata the number of genera and species, particularly univalves, is greatly increased ; and all the genera, and many of the species, bear a close resemblance if they are not identical, with living genera and species. Vertebrated Animals. \u2014 Remains of the lowest class, fish, are extremely rare in transition rocks'; but they appear decidedly in the magnesian limestone over the coal strata ; and in the argillaceous lime stone and clay called lias, the entire bodies of fish are frequently found well preserved. In this stra tum, which is the most remarkable for the abun dance and variety of its organic remains, we first meet with bones of reptiles ofthe saurian or lizard class, of immense size; but different from any exist ing genera, and evidently inhabitants of the ocean, being furnished with paddles instead of feet*. In * Sir Everard Home, and particularly the Rev. W. D. Co nybeare, have elucidated the osteology of these remarkable animals. The Ichthyosaurus, or Fish-Lizard, was an animal in termediate in its organization between the crocodile, the lizard, and fish ; with paddles long broad and flat, instead of feet, designed for moving rapidly through the water : the orbits of its eyes are enormously large. It was an inhabitant of the sea : \u2014 four species have been ascertained, some of which are of im-"], [82, "40 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC REMAINS the upper secondary strata, between the lias and chalk, the remains of saurian animals, closely allied to living species of crocodiles and lizards, are fully developed ; they had feet, and were evidently am phibious. Ofthe saurian animals discovered in this series, that called Iguanodon, discovered by Mr. Mantell at Cuckfield in Sussex, is the most remark able for its size ; the length exceeding seventy feet, and the thickness of the body being equal to that of the elephant. It is supposed to have been herbi vorous. It closely resembles in structure the Iguana, a native of America and the West Indies. In the whole of the transition, the lower secon dary and upper secondary rocks, no remains ofthe highest class of vertebrated animals, the mammalia, are found, nor even of birds ; unless the strata at Stonesfield belong to this series, and form the only known exception. It can scarcely however be sup posed, that during the formation of all the secondary strata, no part of the earth's surface was dry land ; and if dry land really existed, it might be tenanted by warm-blooded quadrupeds; and if so, their bones mense size. The Plesiosaurus, another genus more nearly ap proaching the organization of the lizard, is distinguished from all oviparous quadrupeds by its slender neck; which is longer than its body, and is composed of no less than thirty vertebr\u00e6, exceeding in number those in the neck of the swan. This ani mal is supposed to have swam on the water, with its neck arched to dart on its prey. The Testudo ferox, living in the rivers in Florida, is somewhat similarly constructed; ithides itself in reeds, and darts out its head suddenly to seize birds and other animals. There are five species, of the Plesiosaurus, some of them were more thau twenty feet long. Remains of flying lizards have been discovered in a fossil state in Germany."], [83, "THROUGH THE LOWER AND UPPER STRATA. 41 might have been carried down by rivers or inunda tions into the ancient seas or lakes, at the bottom of which were deposited the strata containing the re mains of amphibious reptiles. It is therefore truly surprising that an intermixture of the bones of ter restrial and marine animals should be of such rare occurrence. Vertebrated animals of the class Birds have left a few of their remains in the tertiary strata, particu larly in the beds of gypsum near Paris : but the bones of birds are so rare, that the existence of any spe cies which might properly be called fossil was long doubted. Cetaceous animals allied to the whale and seal, have left very few vestiges of their former ex istence in any of the strata. Vertebrated land animals of the highest class, the mammalia, have left numerous remains in some parts of the tertiary formations, but more frequently in beds of ancient gravel or clay, than in the solid strata. Cuvier has ascertained the existence of fossil bones belonging to about seventy species of mammiferous quadrupeds. Nearly forty of these are of extinct species, and several of them belong to extinct ge nera, A very considerable number of the large fossil bones belong to the different genera and species of the order named by Cuvier Pachydermata, or thick skinned non-ruminant animals; as the elephant, the mastodon, the tapir, the hippopotamus, the rhi noceros, and the paleotherium. As these bones are very abundantly found in many countries in Europe, it proves that the animals were natives of temperate climates. The known existing species ofthe above genera are all inhabitants of countries near the equator. The fossil elephant, that was"], [84, "42 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC REMAINS once a native of Europe, according to Cuvier dif fered as much from the Asiatic or the African ele phant, as the horse differs from the ass. Bones and teeth of extinct species of carnivorous quadrupeds are generally found in caverns, intermixed with other species, in a broken state. Since the time that these fossil bones have been studiously exa mined by those naturalists who have attended to comparative anatomy, no vestiges of human re mains have been discovered; nor have any of the bones of the animals which approach nearest to man in structure, the Quadrumanes or monkeys, been yet found with those of the more ancient in habitants of the globe. The vast diluvial beds of gravel and clay, and the upper strata in Asia, have however not yet been scientifically explored ; and both sacred and profane writers agree in regard ing the temperate regions of that continent as the cradle ofthe human race*. * It has been conjectured by some persons, that the bones of man are more fragile and perishable than those of land quadru peds : but this is contrary to experience ; for it has been well ob served by Cuvier, that the bones of men, left on the field of battle with those of horses, are as well preserved as the latter, making allowance for the difference of size.

Vegetable fossil remains are not so highly in teresting as those of animals ; but they present us with many ph\u00e6nomena, which are extremely curi ous. A brief outline of them is here given; and a further account of vegetable remains will be found in the chapter on the Coal Strata. Bituminous or vegetable matter occurs in some of the slate rocks of the transition series, and increases in quantity in the soft slate or shale of the secondary strata, where we find portions of plants well preserved and in great abundance. Vegetable remains are also found abundantly in some of the sandstones in the secondary strata, and also in the beds of clay of the tertiary strata. The fossil remains of plants are rarely if ever found in the lower calcareous strata; nor could we expect to meet with them there, as these strata were evidently formed at the bottom of ancient seas. If such remains occasionally occur in the upper calcareous strata, it is reasonable to be lieve that they had been carried by rivers into an cient seas or lakes, and intermixed with the remains of aquatic animals that perished there. In this manner also may we account for the appearance of vegetables in ancient strata or beds of clay con taining marine shells and the teeth or bones of fish. The vegetable remains in the transition and se condary strata belong chiefly to monocotyledonous plants, analogous to palms, reeds, or ferns. Some of the latter are of gigantic size : and it has been ob served, that none of the fossil plants that have been examined, belong to species existing in Europe, but many of them are supposed to resemble species at present flourishing in tropical climates. In the"], [86, "44 ON THE IDENTIFICATION upper or tertiary strata we meet with arborescent plants. In some situations we find that the woody part is only partially mineralized ; but in other si tuations, in the upper strata, fossil vegetables are more completely mineralized than in the lower strata, being apparently changed into flint, or silice fied : but even in this state, when the silicefied sub stance will strike fire with steel, and cut glass, the form of the minutest vegetable fibres may often be perceived, and some trace of the original vegetable principles may be discovered by chemical analysis. Observations. The author has attempted in this chapter to give a succinct account of the Geological distribution of fossil organic re mains, belonging to thc four grand divisions of the animal kingdom. This he conceives will interest the learner, for whose use it was chiefly intended, more than a detailed account of the remains of the genera or species supposed to be peculiar to dif ferent rock formations. With respect to fossil conchology, he is inclined to believe, that the attempt to identify the strata of distant countries by the isolated occurrence cf any particular species of shell, has been carried further than a sound induction from facts or analogy would warrant. His opinion on this subject, given in the 2d edition of this work, he will here in. serf. \" It may be doubted whether the occurrence of similar organic remains, is sufficient to identify strata in distant parts of the globe ; for could we admit that strata are universal forma tions, and extended from the frozen to the torrid zone, it seems more than probable, that the animals which lived on any one particular stratum, would be of very different species in diffe rent latitudes.\" \u2014 We know so little respecting the forms or ha bits of the animals classed by the conchologist, that we are far from certain, whether many shells which he regards as belonging to different species or even genera, are not mere varieties of form, occasioned by difference of age or situation. Such a"], [87, "45 OF STRATA IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. change is ascertained to take place by age in shells of the genus Cyprea. In animals like the molusc\u00e6, which have no internal skeleton to determine their form, the construction of the external shell may probably admit of considerable variation under a change of circumstances. Few conchologists excepting M. D'Avilla have made accurate observations on the living animals inhabiting oceanic shells. His interesting work, entitled ' L' Histoire Naturelle eclaircie dans une de ses parties principales, la Conchologie et augmentee de la Zoomorphose ou Represen tation des animaux a coquilles avec leurs explications, ' \u2014 pre sents us with some truly extraordinary forms of moluscous ani mals, of which we could not have had a remote notion from the mere study of the shell. In strata belonging to one formation and in adjacent districts, the existence of certain shells, whether we regard them as di stinct species or as varieties, may be of use in identifying any particular bed ; \u2014 and in distant countries where we find the same remarkable species of shell associated with any other re markable species in considerable numbers, it may serve to identify a particular rock-formation, where the mineral charac ter of the rock may be very different from that in which the ob server has been accustomed to meet with them. The occur rence of a considerable number of gryphe\u00e6, the Gryphea ar. cuata, in a bed of blue clay in the mountains round the Lake of Annecy in Savoy, \u2014 served the author as a key to discover to what formation the calcareous strata belonged, when their mi neral characters would have indicated a more ancient series."], [88, "46 CHAPTER III. ON THE MINERAL SUBSTANCES THAT COMPOSE THE CRUST OF THE GLOBE; AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF ROCKS. The constituent Elements of the simple Minerals that compose Rocks. \u2014 The physical Characters of simple Minerals com- posing Rocks. \u2014 Explanation of the Terms employed in de- scribing the internal Structure of Rocks, and the external Structure of Mountain Masses. 1 HE most careless observer can scarcely fail to notice, that the mineral substances which occur on the surface of the globe differ from each other in density, hardness, colour, and other sensible quali ties. Indeed the different varieties of stone appear at first so numerous, as to render it difficult to be come acquainted with them : \u2014 but, however nume rous these varieties may be thought, the simple minerals which compose rocks or strata are very few; and the elementary substances of which each of these minerals is formed, are still fewer *. The elementary substances of which the solid matter of our globe is composed, are the Earths \u2014 silex, alumine, lime and magnesia. The Metals \u2014 * The mineralogist and the geologist consider those minerals as simple and homogeneous, which present no difference of quali ties to our senses throughout the mass, although the chemist may discover that such minerals are composed of two or more elementary substances. Thus limestone or marble is regarded as a simple substance, though chemistry has discovered that it contains in every hundred parts \u2014 lime 57 parts, and carbonic acid 43. It is the latter which is expelled from it by burning, \u2014"], [89, "47 ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES. iron and manganese. The Inflammable Principles \u2014 carbon and sulphur ; and the Alkalies \u2014 potash and soda. \u2014 Muriatic and Phosphoric Acid occur also in the mineral kingdom : \u2014 the newly discovered earths and alkalies and metallic ores cannot be regarded as forming essential constituent parts of rocks, they chiefly occur in veins. The first five substances above enumerated compose nineteen parts in twenty ofthe known solid matter of the globe. The Earths when pure are infusible, except at an intense heat; they are nearly insoluble in water at the common temperature: when pure, they are white or colour less. Though the earths are infusible when pure, if they are combined in certain proportions, they may be fused with facility at a comparatively low tem perature. Silex, or Siliceous Earth, exists nearly pure in large masses, forming minerals and even entire rocks ; as rock-crystal, quartz-rock, and flint : it communicates a great degree of hardness to all rocks or stones in which it enters in a large propor tion. Such stones are denominated Siliceous; they resist the point of a knife, or scratch glass. In its combinations with other earths Silex appears to act as an acid. More than one half of the crust of the globe is composed of siliceous earth either pure a process which is well known to make the stone lighter and to render it caustic, in which state it is called quicklime. Nor do the researches ofthe chemist end here : the two substances quick lime orpure lime, and carbonic acid, are themselves compounds ; the former, lime, is a compound of a metallic substance called calcium, united with oxygen; the latter, or carbonic acid, is com posed of oxygen and carbon or charcoal."], [90, "48 ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES. or combined. In some thermal waters, siliceous earth occurs either in a state of minute division or in solution ; and the waters of the boiling springs or geyzers in Iceland deposit siliceous incrustations of considerable thickness. Alumine, pure argillaceous Earth, \u2014 Lat. ar gilla, \u2014 Pr. argille, \u2014 is a substance which in a mixed state is well known ; but pure unmixed clay is one of the rarest substances in the mineral king dom. This earth is soft, smooth, and unctuous to the touch ; it strongly absorbs water ; where it exists in the proportion of thirty per cent, it com municates in some degree these properties : such rocks are called argillaceous ; they generally con tain a notable portion of iron, which appears to have a greater affinity for this earth than for any other*. Lime, \u2014 Lat. calx. \u2014 Fr. chaux, \u2014 is a well-known earth combined with carbonic acid, in which state it forms limestone, marble, and chalk : these only differ from each other by different degrees of hard ness, or of crystallization. Mountains composed of * Though alumine or pure clay communicates a soft quality to most stones of which it forms a principal constituent part, a very remarkable exception to this is offered in adamantine spar and the sapphire, which nearly equal the diamond in hardness. Klaproth, one of the most laborious and eminent chemists of the present age, has analysed these stones : the former contains 90 parts in the 100 of pure clay ; the latter 95 parts in the same quantity. \"What a high degree of cohesive power (he ob serves) must nature command, to be able to transform such a common substance as clay (aluminous earth) into a body so emi nently distinguished and ennobled as the sapphire by its hard ness, brilliancy, and its resistance to the action of fire, of acids, or the effects of all-destroying time!\" \u2014 Klaproth' s Essays."], [91, "ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES. 49 lime are denominated calcareous. When lime is united with sulphuric acid, it forms the stone called gypsum, which is softer than limestone, and does not, like it, effervesce with acids. Calcareous earth mixed with common clay forms marie. Magnesia has rarely been found pure in a native state. It enters into the composition of some of the primary rocks, to which it generally communi cates a soapy feel, a striated or striped texture, and sometimes a greenish colour. It occurs also in va rious limestones in different proportions. Iron appears to be more abundant than magne sian earth ; it forms a constituent part of numerous rocks and stones ; to it they most frequently owe their colour ; the earths when pure are white. Iron when in combination with the earths is like them an oxide, or a metal united with oxygen. To the presence of iron, the increase of specific gravity in all stones or earthy minerals may be attributed, if it much exceed 25, or approach 3 : in other words, if they are nearly three times heavier than an equal bulk of water. Gems and the earths barytes and strontian are exceptions, but these never form en tire rocks. The presence of iron not only increases the weight, and darkens the colour of numerous rocks and stones, but is one principal means oftheir decomposition, for iron exists in stones in two states of oxygenation, as the black or the red oxide ; and when the former is exposed to air and mois ture, it absorbs a greater portion of oxygen, and is converted into a brown ochrey incrustation, which peels off, and exposes a fresh surface of the stone to a similar process. E"], [92, "50 ELEMENTAR. SUBSTANCES. Manganese, in a state of oxide occurs in a few rocks, to which it generally communicates a dull reddish colour inclining to purple, and a peculiarly dry and burnt -like appearance. Sulphur, though found in considerable masses, cannot by itself be regarded as a constituent part of rocks ; but when it is combined with oxygen forming sulphuric acid, it unites with lime and forms the well-known mineral gypsum or plaster stone. Carbon or Charcoal enters as a constituent part into many of the slate rocks, to which it generally communicates a dark colour ; it forms also regular beds of considerable thickness, being the principal constituent part of coal. Carbon combined with oxygen, forms carbonic acid or fixed air, which is combined and solidified in all limestone rocks in a proportion exceeding two-fifths of the whole weight. As carbon exists in such a large propor tion in even the oldest limestones, we may regard it as a constituent element, and not as a substance derived from the vegetable kingdom. For whence did the vegetables themselves derive their carbon ? Potass and Soda. \u2014 These alkalies occur in mine rals which compose parts both of primary and vol canic rocks; but the proportion is so small that they would scarcely deserve the attention ofthe geologist, did not the latter alkali, soda, exist in such abundance in the waters of the ocean and in rock salt. Pure sea salt or rock salt contains nearly 53^- parts of soda 46-j- muriatic acid or chlorine. Muriatic acid combined with soda is the only state in which this acid forms a constituent part of any rocks we are yet acquainted with ; except in"], [93, "QUARTZ. 51 some volcanic rocks, where it may be regarded as accidental. Phosphoric Acid combined with calcareous earth, is a principal constituent of animal bones : it occurs also in a few limestone beds, which are supposed to have derived Phosphoric acid from the decompo sition of animal matter: this acid is of very rare occurrence in the mineral kingdom. The above elementary substances, either sepa rately or combined, form all the simple minerals of which rocks are composed. A knowledge of these minerals and their different intermixtures and com binations, can only be learned by an examination of specimens; they are, however, far from being numerous, and a short description of each is neces sary in an introductory treatise. The most important simple minerals composing rocks are quartz, felspar, mica, talc, chlorite, horn blende, serpentine, limestone, and slate. Quartz is one of the hardest minerals of which mountain masses are composed : it gives plentiful sparks with steel; it breaks with a smart stroke ofthe hammer ; the surface of the fracture in crystallized quartz is conchoidal, in uncrystallized, splintery ; \u2014 the lustre is vitreous. Crystals of quartz, or rock crystals, as they are commonly denominated, have dif ferentdegrees of transparency; the blue varieties are amethysts. The most common forms ofthe crystals are six-sided prisms terminated by six-sided pyra mids, or two six-sided pyramids united, formingado decahedron whose faces are isosceles triangles. Un crystallized quartz is seldom transparent, most fre- e2"], [94, "52 QUARTZ. quently translucent, but sometimes opaque. Its colours are various shades of white, gray, brown, yellow, red, and green. It yields a phosphorescent light and peculiar odour when rubbed. Quartz is composed of siliceous earth combined with a very small portion of alumine. It is infusible when un mixed ; but with alkalies it melts easily, and forms the well known substance called glass. It is not acted upon by any acid except the fluoric. Quartz exists in veins intersecting mountains, and it some times forms large beds, and even entire mountains, which are composed of this mineral in grains united without a cement, called granular quartz. Fragments or crystals of quartz are common in compound rocks. Grains of quartz form a principal constituent part of most sandstones. The milk white pebbles in gravel are composed of quartz. Flint, chert or hornstone, opal, chalcedony, and agate, are different modifications of siliceous earth, which in their chemical composition differ little from quartz. Combined with a large portion of alumine and iron, quartz loses its translucency and passes into jasper, which forms beds in primitive mountains, and is said to compose the substance of entire ranges of mountains in Asia. Felspar or feldspar (a name received from the Germans) is a constituent part of numerous rocks. It is hard in a somewhat less degree than quartz, and is more easily broken. It is laminar, or com posed of thin lamin\u00e6 or plates, by which it may be generally distinguished from quartz. The crystals are most commonly four-sided or six-sided prisms,"], [95, "53 FELSPAR. whose length is greater than the breadth. It has a shining lustre. The colours are white, gray, milk-white, yellowish, or reddish white, sometimes inclining to green. The red passes through various shades, from a pale to a deep red. Crystallized felspar is translucent. It may be melted without the admixture of alkalies, and forms a glass more or less transparent, which quality it derives from the lime or alkali that compose part of its constituent ingredients ; but different specimens of this mineral vary, according to the analyses of the same che- mist Silex .... 63 \u2014 74 Alumine . . 17 \u2014 14 Potash ... 13 \u2014 Lime .... 3 \u2014 6 Oxide of iron 1 \u2014 Loss .... 3 \u2014 6 Others give the proportion of silex 46, alumine 24, lime 6. The existence of potash or the vegetable alkali in felspar, is a fact deserving particular attention*. It may be owing to this circumstance that felspar is so frequently observed in a soft or decomposing state, although its hardness is little inferior to that of quartz when undecayed. Those felspars which * It has recently been discovered, that in some of the felspa thic rocks, soda occupies the place of potash, and gives a slight change to the crystalline form : this variety some mineralogists are desirous of making a new species, and have proposed to give it the name of Cleavelandite ; but geology and mineralogy are already too much burdened with unmeaning terms, and if a new name must be introduced, that of felsparite would at once convey an idea of its approximation to felspar."], [96, "54 MICA AND TALI are durable are probably free from potash. Felspar is sometimes uncrystallized and compact, in which state it is classed by the French mineralogists with petrosilex or hornstone. Compact felspar, however, differs from hornstone, the latter being infusible without the addition of alkalies. Mica derives its name from the Latin micans, glittering. It is known as the substance called Muscovy glass, and has a splendid lustre. It con sists of very thin leaves or lamin\u00e6, which may be easily separated with a knife. The plates are elas tic, by which it may be distinguished from the mi neral called talc. The thin plates are transparent. The colours of the thick plates are yellow, gray, blackish green, white, and brown. The surface may be scratched with a knife : it melts into an enamel with the blowpipe : it is rarely met with crystallized. Talc nearly resembles mica in appearance. The plates are flexible, but not elastic : it is much softer than mica, and is infusible ; its colours generally incline towards green ; but it is sometimes a silver white : it has a soapy feel. Chlorite, which is nearly allied to talc, derives its name from chloros, the Greek word signifying green. Talc and chlo rite pass by insensible gradations into each other, and in this state they supply the place of mica in most ofthe granitic rocks that I have examined in the vicinity of Mont Blanc. Chlorite is ofa darkish dull green colour ; it has a glistening lustre ; its structure is minutely foliated ; it is soft, and rather unctuous.

Hornblende, to which the French give the name of amphibole, forms a constituent part of many rocks, and appears to connect the primary with those which are of volcanic origin. It is of a black or dark green colour : it is heavier but less hard than quartz or felspar ; it may be scratched with a knife, and the colour of the streak is a light green : it yields a bitter smell when breathed upon, and melts easily into a black glass. Common hornblende is often confusedly crystallized; it sometimes forms entire mountains, or slaty beds in mountains, and is very commonly met with, in granular pieces, as an ingredient in compound rocks : when it becomes more abundantly and minutely disseminated in them, it forms what are denominated trap rocks, whose origin has greatly divided the opinions of geologists.

Limestone, Carbonate of lime, hoAvever various in external appearance it may be, is, if pure, essen tially composed of 57 parts of lime and 43 carbonic acid ; but in some rocks the limestone is intermixed with magnesia, alumine, silex or iron. The spe cific gravity of limestone varies from 2-50 to 280. All limestones may be scraped with a knife. They are infusible; but when impure by an intermixture with a portion of other earths, they vitrify in burn ing. All limestones effervesce when a drop of strong acid is applied on the surface, and they dis solve entirely in nitric or muriatic acid. The spe cific gravity, hardness, and effervescence with acids taken collectively, distinguish limestone from all other minerals."], [99, "57 GYPSUM. Crystallized Carbonate of Lime, Calcareous Spar, occurs crystallized in a great variety of forms; but the crystals break easily with the stroke of a ham mer, and the fragments are always rhomboidal. Vast mountains and extensive strata of limestone cover a large portion of many countries. The va rieties of limestone will be described, as the rocks occur in the primary or secondary series. The different appearance of statuary marble and chalk is well known to every one. They are only diffe rent modifications of limestone, and are chemically the same. Magnesian limestone, sometimes called Dolomite, possesses most ofthe physical characters of common limestone, but contains various propor tions of magnesia : it will be described when we treat of the rocks with which it is associated. Gypsum, or Sulphate of Lime, is far less abun dant than Carbonate of Lime, but it forms in some situations beds of considerable thickness and extent. Gypsum is generally ofa colour inclining to white, and is sometimes snow-white. Common gypsum has a laminated or granular structure, and is some times compact. It is much softer than common limestone, and may be scratched with the nail : it does not effervesce with acids. Crystallized gyp sum has the properties of common gypsum ; it is frequently called selenite. The constituent parts of gypsum are lime 327, sulphuric acid 463, and water 21. A variety of gypsum which has no wa ter in its composition, and hence called anhydrous, occurs in beds in the Savoy Alps ; it is there com bined with siliceous earth. It is much harder than common gypsum, and even than common limestone."], [100, "58 . LVTI The specific gravity of common gypsum varies from 216 to 2-28, that of anhydrous gypsum is from 280 to 290. Gypsum under the name of plaster stone is a mineral generally known. Slate, improperly called by some geologists Clay slate, and by the old geologists Argillaceous Schis tus, is well known, \u2014 at least the common variety used as roofing-slate, which may be regarded as the purest form of this mineral. The prevailing colours of slate are blueish or greenish gray ; it has a silky lustre. Slate rocks have frequently a distinct slaty structure, and may even be split in two directions, which have an acute angle with each other ; but some slate rocks have a compact structure, and will not admit of splitting ; slate yields to the knife, it is fusible into a black slagg. The composition of slate is various ; indeed by many geologists it is not regarded as an homo geneous rock. Its composition has been given as under: Silex 48, alumine 23, manganese, 1'6, oxide of iron 113, oxide of manganese 05, potass 4-7, carbon 03, water 76. The quantity of carbon increases in the upper formations of slate, and it passes by a greater admixture of carbon into a soft dark slaty bed, denominated shale by the English miners. Slate is a very extensive formation, com posing entire mountains in many alpine districts. Basalt and compact lavas are classed by some mineralogists with simple minerals, but they are composed of three or more simple minerals closely united : \u2014 they will be afterwards described. Some of the minerals here enumerated compose entire rocks ; other rocks are composed of an in-"], [101, "59 INTERNAL STRUCTURE. termixture of two or more simple minerals, either cemented together by another mineral substance, or the minerals are crystallized and united without a cement. The different modes in which simple mi nerals are found united together in rocks have given rise to the following terms. Gi'anitic, composed of grains or crystals united with- out a cement, as in granites and some sand- stones. Porphyritic, composed of a compact homogeneous rock, in which distinct crystals or grains are embedded. The compactstoneiscalledthebase, and sometimes the paste. The base of some porphyritic rocks is granitic ; in this case some of the crystals are much larger than the rest. Amygdaloidal, containing rounded cavities filled with mineral matter of a different kind. Breccia is composed of angular fragments of rocks cemented together. Pudding-stone consists of rounded stones imbedded in a paste. Fragments of stone broken from simple rocks display the structure of the internal parts. The face of the broken part is called the fracture. This internal structure may be denominated the mineral structure, and is either Compact, without any distinguishable parts or di- visions \u2014 or Earthy, comprised of minute parts resembling dried earth. Granular, composed of grains. Fibrous, composed of long and minute fibres. Radiated, when the fibres are broader and flattish, and diverging."], [102, "60 EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OF ROCKS. Lamellar or Foliated, composed of minute plates laid over each other. Porous, penetrated by pores. Cellular or Vesicular, when the pores swell into rounded cavities like bladders, as in some lavas. Slaty or Laminar, composed of straight parallel thin plates, or lamin\u00e6. The structure of compound rocks may also be Slaty. The external structure of rocks en masse, or con sidered as mountain masses, is as distinct from their internal mineral structure as the shape of a build ing from that of the bricks or stones of which it is composed, though this distinction has been gene rally overlooked. The external structure of rocks, as forming mountain masses, may be Stratified, or stratiform. Tabular, or in large plates. Columnar. Globular, or in spherical masses. Massive or Indeterminate, which includes all un stratified rocks that have no determinate shape. Stratified mountains or rocks are those which are composed of layers of stone, laid over each other, and divided by parallel seams like the leaves of a closed book. In these seams or partings, which di vide the strata, there are frequently thin lamin\u00e6 of soft earthy matter ; but sometimes the surfaces of the upper and lower stratum are so closely joined, that it requires a considerable force to separate them. These layers are denominated strata ; they extend through the whole mountain or mass, their length and breadth being much greater than their thick-"], [103, "61 EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OF ROCKS. ness. If the thickness of any stratum exceed two or three yards, it is more usually denominated a bed ; and if it lie between beds of stone of a dif ferent kind, it is said to be imbedded. Strata always decline or dip down to some point of the horizon, and of course rise towards the opposite point. A line drawn through these points is called the line of their dip ; another line drawn at right angles to this, marks the course along which the strata stretch out to the greatest extent ; \u2014 it is called the line of bearing. Isa book be raised in an inclined posi tion, with the back resting lengthways upon the table, the leaves may be supposed to represent dif ferent strata ; then the direction of the leaves from the upper edges to the table will be the line of dip, and their direction lengthways the line of bearing; and the angle they make with the table will be the angle of inclination Strata are, however, some times waved or bent in both directions, and are fre quently broken ; which makes it difficult to ascer tain their true position. It is generally supposed that stratified rocks were formed by the motion of water, which arranged them in succession over each other in the same man ner as the muddy waves of the ocean deposit their contents in regular layers upon the shore. This mode of formation is called mechanical deposition. It has also been erroneously though generally be lieved, that all rocks divided by parallel seams into separate layers, are stratified in the direction ofthe seams or partings, and this error has led to much confusion in describing rocks ; this will be more fully explained in the following chapter. The tabular structure consists of parallel plates"], [104, "62 EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OK ROCKS. of rock, separated by regular seams. This structure has often been confounded with stratification : it ap pears to be the result of crystallization, and is closely allied to the columnar structure. The Columnar or Prismatic structure is peculiar to certain rocks, but chiefly occurs in the basaltic and volcanic class. Thick beds are divided into columns or prisms, which are most generally pentagonal. They sometimes form vast ranges of natural columns; as at Staffa, the Giants' Causeway in Ireland, and in many volcanic countries. Sometimes the prismatic structure maybe observed forming detached groups of columns and prisms, as represented in the group of columns on Cader Idris, Plate 5. A group of basaltic columns of similar form and equally perfect, was observed by the author on the side of the vol canic mountain called Gravenaire in Auvergne, at a small distance from the crater. The Globular structure consists of globular masses either detached or imbedded in rocks of the same kind ; they are frequently composed of concentric layers. The terms Massive or Indeterminate, may be ap plied to all unstratified rocks that have no regular divisions. Many ofthe primary rocks, such as gra nite, porphyry, and serpentine, occur in masses of enormous thickness, which are broken by irregular fissures in every direction. Thick currents of lava, which have silled up hollows or valleys, are also in determinate, as might be expected from their mode of formation. Sometimes rocks of granite and por phyry, and also of compact lava, present either a tabular or a columnar structure ; but the structure is seldom so regular as in basaltic rocks."], [105, "63 CHAPTER IV.

WHEN we have ascertained what are the most common or prevailing rocks in a part of any coun try, and observed that any one stratum or rock which attracts our attention is in that part of the country invariably covered by a peculiar rock or stratum of a different kind, or invariably covers any parti cular stratum ; we hence learn that there is a cer tain order of superposition, and we naturally feel desirous to know whether the same order is obser vable in every country where similar rocks occur. Thus in the vale of Thames round London, there is at the depth of a few feet under the surface, a dark-coloured clay called London Clay ; and if we bore through this clay, we shall find its average thick-"], [106, "64 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. ness to be nearly 300 feet : but when we have pierced through this clay, we invariably come to chalk ; and were we to continue to bore in the chalk, after piercing through many hundred feetof that rock, we should come to a stratum of sand or sandstone filled with green particles, and hence called Green Sand. The observer who had confined his researches to this part of the country only, would form a very er roneous conclusion were he to infer, that the outer crust ofthe globe was invariably composed of Lon don Clay, Chalk, and Green Sand. But wherever si milar beds occur together, they lie in the same order of superposition over each other. Thus the London Clay is never found under the Chalk, or the Green Sand. But it is not always necessary to bore through the upper beds to ascertain this order : for the dif ferent strata scarcely ever occur in a flat or hori zontal position ; they generally rise in a certain di rection, and come to the surface, as represented in Plate 1, fig. I. Now by travelling in the direction of the strata from a to b, we come upon the outer edges 12 3, and may trace their order of succession as they rise from under each other. In ravines and the escarpments of mountains, and in the cliffs on the sea coast, we are also enabled to trace the order of position and succession of rocks. But to do this with tolerable correctness, we must have an accu rate knowledge of stratification in all its various possible forms. However simple the principles of stratification may at first appear, this knowledge when applied to practice is not of such easy attain ment as some, many imagine, and for want of it Geo-"], [107, "PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. 65 logists of considerable eminence have fallen into the most egregious errors. A knowledge of Stratifi cation is indeed of far greater importance to the practical geologist, than an acquaintance with the minutia, of Mineralogy or Conchology. Though the word Stratum in its original lan guage and by general acceptation, in speaking of rocks, denotes a bed, it is convenient to restrict the term bed to strata of considerable thickness; for such beds are often subdivided into several distinct minor strata, and we cannot well describe a strati fied stratum. When a series of strata of a similar rock are ar ranged with occasional strata intervening of rocks of another kind, which recur in different parts of the series, they are regarded as having been formed nearly at the same epoch, and under similar circum stances ; and such series are called by geologists Formations. Thus the strata of marie accompanying chalk, with the strata containing nodules or layers of flint, are, together with the whole series of chalk strata, denominated the chalk formation. In order to obtain a distinct idea of stratification in its sim plest form, let the young geologist take a piece of pasteboard or thin wood, \u2014 say 12 inches square: let him divide it inthemiddleintotwo equal planes, each 12 inches in length and 6 in breadth. Place one of these planes flat on a table with the ends facing the north and south; the sides will of course be at right ane-les, and face the east and west. Now if one of the sides be tilted, \u2014 say the western side, \u2014 we may suppose the pasteboard plane to represent a stratum rising to the west and dipping eastward. The F"], [108, "66 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. lengthways direction ofthe plane is called the line of bearing; and the declining direction is called the line os dip, which is at right angles to the line of bearing. The angle at which the stratum rises above the horizontal line or level is called the Incli nation. Suppose the western edge of the paste board plane is raised above the table, forming with it an angle of thirty degrees ; then we say the direction of the stratum is north and south, its clip east, its rise of course west, and its angle of in clination thirty degrees. Simple as this appears, geologists of considerable eminence have made the most palpable mistakes in defining stratification. It has been said correctly, that the line of dip being always at right angles to the direction or line of bearing, when the dip is given, the direction is known : but when it is further said, that if the direc tion is given, the line of dip is given also, the asser tion is erroneous ; for let the above plane of paste board be again laid flat upon the table in the same direction, due north and south ; but instead of tilting up the western edge, if we tilt up the eastern, we shall then have the same line of bearing as in the first instance, but the dip will be west instead of east. It sometimes happens that a stratum without varying its direction may dip two ways in the same mountain, like the sloping sides of the roof of a church, or the letter \\ reversed. Place the two planes of pasteboard in a north and south direction, and raise them so as to make the upper edges meet ; we shall then have the line of bearing north and south as before, and the dip east on one side and"], [109, "PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. 67 west on the other. The limestone strata at Dudley Castle Hill dip on each side of the hill as above described. Whatever may be the inclination of a stratum, its true thickness is measured by a line perpendi cular to the upper and under surface. If we take a number of similar planes of paste- board of different colours, and lay the undermost a little inclined, and place another plane upon it, with the upper edge about an inch or more distant from that of the under stratum, and again lay the others in succession in the same manner ; the un- covered ends of the planes will rise from under each other like a number of slices of bread and butter laid on a plate. These uncovered edges will represent the outcrop or crop of the strata ; and it will be perceived how we may obtain a knowledge of an under stratum, without sinking or boring, merely by crossing a country in the line of the rise or dip of the strata. When strata are arranged in this manner, they are said to be in a conformable position. (Plate 1. fig. 1.) It will naturally be in- quired, whether the strata absolutely terminate where we find their outcrop ? In some instances this is the case ; but frequently the strata are bent or broken in the line of their rise, and the same stratum may crop out in one place and appear again further on in the line of its rise, as represented Plate 1. fig. 2. We must be particularly attentive to this circumstance, otherwise we may mistake the true position of a stratum, and describe it as one much lower in the series we are examining. In some instances we come suddenly to the termina- f2"], [110, "68 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION, tion of a whole series of strata, as in descending the Cotswold Hills into the Vale of Severn ; the limestone called Roe-stone, of which they are prin cipally composed, is not found on the other side of the valley, nor in any part of England to the north-west of it. Has this limestone ever extended further ? and if it have extended further, by what cause has it been removed ? These inquiries will be adverted to in a following chapter. To return to our pasteboard planes, arranged as before described, with the edges rising from under each other in the conformable position. If we take another series of planes, and lay them flat over the outcropping edges of the conformable series, we shall then have the unconformable position repre sented, Plate 1. fig. 3. Now the strata that cover the lower stratified class in England occur in this position ; and the following important inference may be drawn from it, namely, that the under stra tified rocks had been formed, and their strata broken and raised up, at a period which must have pre ceded the formation of the upper series by a consi derable interval. For the lower series were evi dently solidified, and afterwards in many instances broken; and the fractured edges of the strata le velled, before the unconformable strata were depo sited upon them. The most common error which persons com mencing the study of geology are liable to make, is in mistaking the apparent for the real inclination of the strata. Plate 1. fig. 4. will render this more intelligible than any description. It repre sents a portion of a stratified mountain, of which"], [111, "69 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. the strata have a considerable dip to the east. If the escarpment or section be made in the line of bearing, the strata will appear to range from north to south, without any rise or dip, and would be de scribed by a young observer as being horizontal. But if an opening or section be made on the side parallel to the line of dip, as at c c, the true inclina tion will be seen. Any section made in an oblique direction to the line of dip will cause the inclina tion to appear less than the true one, and the line of dip will appear to vary from the true one. The chances therefore are very great against the natural section made in a mountain presenting the true dip and inclination of the strata. Another error which a person who does not attend to the dip and direc tion of the strata may fall into is, mistaking an under for an upper stratum. Suppose a hill to be covered with vegetable soil, and a quarry or pit was made in it near the bottom, as at _, Plate 1. fig, 1. and the stone was discovered to be sandstone : suppose an other pit was sunk near the summit at . , which cut into limestone ; it might be supposed that the lime stone lay over the sandstone stratum, when it is in reality below it. The young observer, who has not a clear notion of this, may be said not yet to have passed the pons asinorum of the geologist. In calcareous mountains of vast magnitude, as those in the Swiss and Savoy iUps, the enormous beds of limestone are often intersected by regular seams, which cut through the whole bed in a direc tion nearly perpendicular to that of the true strata seams, or make very oblique angles with them. These partings or seams are sometimes nearly ver-"], [112, "70 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. tical, when the strata are almost horizontal. The cliffs and escarpments of these mountains being lofty and much exposed to the action of the atmosphere, the vertical seams enlarge, and are often more con- spicuous than the strata seams ; hence without great attention, the observer may describe the strata of a mountain as being perpendicular, when in reality they are nearly horizontal. To add to the difficulty, it very frequently happens that a calca- reous deposition like a coat of plaster covers the face of a rock : this has been formed by moisture running over the surface, and depositing calcareous particles upon it. This deposition sometimes con- ceals the stratification seams as completely as a coat of plaster covers the rows of brick in a build- ing. The vertical seams or partings are also some- times open, and sometimes have formed parallel ridges, which efface the appearance of the strata seams in one part of a rock, but not in the other ; and in such instances we have apparently a moun tain mass in which the strata are partly horizontal and partly vertical. See Plate 1. fig. 5. Inattention to this circumstance I am convinced has sometimes deceived the eye of M. Saussure, one of the most diligent and accurate of observers. The modes of stratification we have been consi dering are those of plane strata ; but in many situa tions, particularly in the Alps and the Jura chain, the strata are curved and bent round the mountains, encircling them like a mantle. The ravines and escarpments, according to the position in which the sections have been made, present the most varied forms of stratification in the same mountain. In one"], [113, "PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. 71 part, the strata will seem to rise almost vertically ; in another, to be nearly horizontal ; and in a third, to be deeply curved : and this will depend much on the relative position of the observer, whether he be placed on one side or in face of the escarpment. Suppose a transverse section be made through a mountain in the direction a, b (Plate 1. fig. 6.), it would show the true position of the arched strata : but if we suppose the side of the mountain c, d, to be removed, an observer placed at e would see the face or escarpment on that side, with the edges of the strata lying horizontally, and might describe them as horizontally stratified, were he to view no other part of the mountain. In some situations the fracture made in the arched stratification is much broken ; and we have on the side of the same moun tain the appearance both of horizontal and greatly inclined stratification. An instance of this occurs near the Lake of Bourget in Savoy. Plate 2. fig. 1. represents the appearance of strata on the side ofa mountain, which has the arched stratification before described ; but the outermost strata, instead of en folding the whole mountain, only cover the south ern side, and are broken off at the summit in a line nearly parallel with it ; and their edges pre sent the appearance of horizontal strata, a, a, a. Lower down the mountain, part of the under strata have fallen off in a sloping direction, and their projecting edges present at a distance the ap pearance of highly inclined strata. This may be further illustrated by taking a half cylinder, or, for want of that, a thick book ; and opening it a little, place it with the edges upon the table, and the back"], [114, "72 PRINCIPLES OF STRATIFICATION. uppermost ; cover the book or half cylinder with a number of folds of paper of different colours, \u2014 these will represent arched strata. Cut away the outer most folds along the back, and take away the other half; the edges of the paper will represent those of the upper strata, and their position will appear to be horizontal. Cut away the corners of the under sheets a little behind each other, so that the edges of each coloured sheet may be visible ; and these will represent the appearance of highly inclined strata, and have frequently been mistaken for such. The young geologist may greatly facilitate the study of stratification, by laying coloured planes of any soft and yielding substance over each other, and inclining them in various positions ; then let him make sections in different directions with a knife, and also carve out hollows representing val leys, cutting through inclined strata at various an gles with the line of dip and line of bearing : by this means he may gain a more correct idea of the varied ph\u00e6nomena of stratification, both in moun tains and valleys, than the most elaborate descrip tions can convey. The strata of secondary rocks belonging to the same formation generally preserve the same thick ness for a considerable extent, and are arranged conformably over each other, except in situations where the regularity ofthe strata has been disturbed by rents or fractures. In these secondary conform able strata, the order in which thev succeed each other indicates their relative ages ; but this rule cannot be extended to all classes of rocks. No inference can at first appear more legitimate"], [115, "CONFORMABLE STRATA. 73 than this : \" The rock which supports another must be older than that which rests upon it, if their ori ginal position has not been changed.\" But this con clusion, when examined with attention, will fairly admit of doubt with respect to those rocks which are crystalline like the primary. These were formed by chemical affinity from a state of solution, or by crystallization from a state of fusion : \u2014 if by the lat ter mode, all the different beds may have been ar ranged at the same time, and the upper and lower rocks may have a cotemporaneous origin. Isa mass of melted matter from a furnace cool slowly, the internal and external parts will vary both in their physical and chemical properties ; but it cannot, on this account, be said that the lower part is older than the upper. In those rocks which have been subjected to external agency, as in sand rocks which contain fragments that have been rounded by water, their situation evidently proves that they were formed after the rocks on which they rest. It has been before observed, that those rocks which contain different species of organic remains, separated by beds or strata in which no such re mains occur, must have been formed in succession over each other, and probably at very distant inter vals of time. This inference appears to me con clusive, nor can it be invalidated by the crystalline arrangement and cleavage of some of those rocks. Rocks of the primary class frequently cover each other in an order which, viewed on a grand scale, may be said to be conformable; but the different rocks in each class are generally of such vast and irregular thickness, that their order of succession is"], [116, "74 UNCONFORMABLE ROCKS. often not easy to trace : beside, some of these rocks pass by a change of structure into each other, and their line of junction or separation can seldom be observed. Viewed, however, as composing moun tain chains, the more general arrangement is repre sented, Plate 3. fig. 1. on which granite or the foundation rock is marked a, gneiss b, mica slate c, common slate _, the transition series c, c, and the lower secondary d f, f. x x, represents the posi tion of a bed of limestone or any other rock in a mountain of slate ; in this position it is said to be imbedded; and isa number of these beds occur, they are said to be subordinate. The unconformable position of unstratified rocks is represented, Plate 3. fig. 2. where d is a mass of columnar basalt, and c a mass of porphyry resting upon the rocks 1, 2, 3, without any conformity to the shape of the lower beds. Whatever theory we adopt respecting the formation of rocks, we must admit that the superincumbent rocks in this situa tion are of more recent origin than those which they cover : the lower must have been hard and unyielding, when the upper were thrown upon them. If a thick stream of lava, as frequently hap pens, were to flow over a range of conformable rocks, filling up the cavities and inequalities of the surface, \u2014 when it became hard by cooling, it would form abed of superincumbent unconformable rock. Such instances are common in volcanic countries. Very extensive ranges of rocks and mountains occur in this position in various parts of the world, not only covering the primary, but the secondary rocks. These will hereafter be described, under the name"], [117, "UNCONFORMABLE ROCKS. 75 of porphyry, sienite, and basalt. They frequently assume the columnar structure, and sometimes form vast ranges of natural pillars ; as at Staffa one of the Hebrides, on the north coast of Ireland, in Iceland, Sicily, and many volcanic countries. Having described the position of both stratified and unstratified unconformable rocks, it may be proper to state that the latter rocks occur, covering both primary, transition, secondary, and tertiary strata : many of those which cover the secondary and tertiary, seem evidently to have been the pro ducts of subterranean fires; and even those which cover the primary and transition rocks, bear a close affinity to volcanic rocks. If we admit that our loftiest ranges of mountains were elevated by the expansive force of central fires, this power acting upon an extensive portion of the globe, might be ages in upheaving the incumbent surface, which would continue to rise until vast fissures were made, through which the subterranean melted matter would be thrown over the mountains and plains then existing, and form the superincumbent rocks of basalt, porphyry, and sienite, that seem to be so nearly allied to volcanic products. While one part ofthe surface was rising, another part would sink, and form a new bed into which the waters of the ocean would gradually retire. According to Humboldt, the extraordinary erup tions by which new islands have been formed since the period of authentic history, have been pre ceded by a swelling of the softened crust of the globe. At Kamerni, the new island made its ap pearance above the sea twenty-six days before the"], [118, "76 BREAKS IN THE CONTINUITY smoke was visible. \" Every thing indicates that the physical changes of which tradition has pre served the remembrance, exhibit but a feeble image of those gigantic catastrophes which have given mountains their present form, changed the position ofthe rocky strata, and buried sea-shells on the summit of the higher alps. It was undoubtedly in those remote times which preceded the existence of the human race, that the raised crust of the globe produced those domes of trappean porphyry, those hills of isolated basalt in vast elevated plains, those solid nuclei covered with the modern lavas of the Peak of Teneriffe, of Etna, and Cotopaxi.\" Hum boldt. To these great catastrophes, and the mighty force of vast inundations which have swept over our pre sent continents, must we ascribe the inequalities of the earth's surface, the elevation of mountains, the excavation of valleys, which have broken the con tinuity of strata, and removed the broken parts into distant countries. \u2014 It is not my intention in the present chapter to enter on the subject ofthe for mation of valleys ; it will be reserved for a subse quent part of the volume : but it may be useful to state to the geological student, that all stratified mountains are only parts of extended strata, with which they were once united. This will be more distinctly understood by con sulting Plate 4. fig. 1. which is intended to re present the general rise of the strata from Sheffield in Yorkshire to Castleton in Derbyshire, intersected by the valley through which the river Derwent flows."], [119, "OF STRATA BY VALLEYS. 77 The town of Sheffield, fig. 1. is built over coal strata, which rise towards the west, and disappear in that direction about five miles from Sheffield (2). Here the under rock makes its appearance (3), which is a bed of coarse gritstone, more than one hundred and twenty yards in thickness, forming the summits of all the mountains as you advance to the vale of Derwent (4). The grit-rock rests upon a thicker bed, of a different kind, composed of slaty sandstone, represented (5). On the western side of the valley, this rock exists only as a cap or covering on Whin-Hill, a lofty mountain, marked (6). Two miles further west the grit-rock disappears, and the slaty sandstone which is the base of Whin-Hill forms the summit of the celebrated Mam Tor, or the shivering mountain. The mountain limestone (7) here makes its appearance as the base of Mam Tor, and further west the same limestone forms entire mountains. The difference observable in the rocks east and west of the Derwent is owing to the general rise ofthe strata in the latter direction. It is here obvious that Whin-Hill, though it ap pears an isolated mountain, is only a portion of the thick beds of gritstone, and slaty sandstone, which form the hills on the other side of the valley. When valleys take the same direction as that of a range of mountains, they are called longitudinal valleys ; when they cut through a range of moun tains, they are called transversal valleys; in the lat ter case, the strata on each side are most generally prolongations of the same beds. The small valleys which open into a larger valley nearly at right angles to it are called lateral, valleys. In some rare instances, a valley is formed by the"], [120, "78 MOUNTAINS AND bending ofthe strata, which make a trough as re presented Plate 1. fig. 2. Mountains, except those formed by volcanos, are seldom isolated masses rising from a plain, but they form groups, or are ranged together in a certain direction, and compose long and lofty ridges, de nominated mountain chains. Lower ranges of mountains, running in the same direction as the principal range, and separated by valleys of greater or less width, may be observed accompanying almost all very lofty mountain chains. This fact appears to indicate the operation of a powerful elevating force, acting- in one direction along a certain line, and decreasing in intensity as the distance from each side of this line increases : but this action does not appear to extend with equal force on both sides of the line; for the smaller chains parallel to the great chain are seldom so numerous on one side of it as on the other. The principal mountain chain, if very large, has its sides furrowed by small lateral valleys, and has not been unaptly compared to a back-bone or spine, with diverging ribs. Mountain chains traverse continents and islands, and appear to constitute the skeleton on which they are formed. The shape of many countries and islands is evidently determined by the direction of the grand mountain chains that run through them. The principal mountains in the old continents when viewed on a large scale may be considered as forming a mountain chain composed of numerous mountain groups, and extending in an easterly di rection from Cape Finisterre in Spain, to the most eastern extremity of Asia. Various parts of this chain receive different denominations in the diffe-"], [121, "MOUNTAIN RANGES. 79 rent countries through which they pass. The Py renees, the Alps, Mount Taurus, Mount Caucasus, the Altaic and the Himmaleh mountains, and the Yablonnoy mountains of Tartary which extend nearly to Beerhing's Straits, may be regarded as forming together one immense mountain chain, and dividing the northern from the southern dry land both in Europe and Asia. In North and South America one unbroken chain of mountains runs in a northerly and southerly di rection for eight thousand miles near the western side of that vast continent, and with some minor di verging chains has evidently determined the gene ral outline of both countries. A remarkable simi larity occurs in the position of the escarpments or steep sides of mountains in the same mountain range. Various opinions have been formed respect ing the law which the position of the escarpments appears to follow; but I believe the rule I submitted to the attention of geologists in the first edition of this work will be found to approximate to the truth. Mountain chains or ranges present the steepest declivities on the sides nearest to the sea. This is remarkably the case in the long chain of the Al leghany mountains on the eastern side of America, which are steep towards the Atlantic. On the con trary, the Stony-mountains which run near the north-west coast, and the Andes near the southern Pacific ocean, are steepest on their western side. In ranges of mountains that form the boundaries of lakes or of extensive vales, through which large ri vers flow, the mountains nearest to the rivers have the steepest declivities. The largest rivers have their origin from the sides of mountains which are"], [122, "80 VERTICAL MOUNTAIN BEDS. most inclined to the horizon, and most remote from the sea. The beds or strata of very lofty mountains are generally much inclined, and are sometimes nearly vertical. Among these highly inclined beds, we not unfrequently observe beds of limestone contain- ing marine shells, which must have been originally deposited at the bottom of the ocean. In some in- stances we meet with vertical strata, containing rounded pebbles and water-worn fragments of other rocks; these must alsohave been originally deposited on a surface nearly horizontal: we are therefore certain, that the present vertical position of these strata is not their original one ; and we hence also learn, that all the strata associated with them in the same mountain, and having the same inclination, were raised together. We have further proof that before the epoch when this great revolution was ef- fected, all these beds were covered by the seas then existing, and it was under the ocean that the change of position took place. No person who reflects on the appearances pre sented in a mountainous district can believe that the broken and elevated beds, the peaked summits, the impending cliffs, and the immense fragments of rock scattered in the valleys and adjacent countries, were originally created and placed as we now ob serve them. The traveller who in crossing an extended de sert should meet with the remains of some unknown temple, could not for a moment doubt that the bro ken and prostrate columns, the mutilated arches, the scattered capitals and inscriptions, had been re moved by some devastating cause from their origi-"], [123, "COLS, OR PASSAGES IN THE ALPS. 81 nai position ; nor is the proof less certain, that the rocky pavement of our globe has been broken, and its parts which were once united, widely sepa rated from each other. Some of the ph\u00e6nomena we observe in mountains were produced by the disturbing force which first elevated them ; others have been subsequently effected either by vast inun dations, which have swept over their summits and torn away considerable portions of the softer beds, or by the more gradual decomposition and disinte gration produced by atmospheric influence ; by the latter cause, the lofty and exposed peaks and escarp ments of rocks are slowly wearing down. During the two summers I passed in the Alps, I was much struck with the circumstance that all the great openings or passages over these mountains, called Cols, were made by excavations in beds of soft sla'te; and the fact I think admits of an easy ex planation, but I do not know that it has been before remarked by Geologists. If we suppose a portion of the Alps to be repre sented, Plate 2. the dotted lines above the present surface will mark the supposed original prolonga tion of the different beds at the period when they were raised. As the ocean, from whence these beds were raised, must have been agitated with inconceivable violence, the retiring waters would scoop out deep excavations in the softer beds of schist, and also tear off many ofthe vertical plates of the hardest rocks, and form the rudiments of these pyramidal peaks and aiguilles, which rise like the spires of a Gothic cathedral.

The same causes that have produced granite and the other primary rocks in immense masses below all other rocks, have in some situations reproduced them in smaller masses, co vering rocks belonging to the Transition or Secon dary Classes. No systems of classification can be made so definite in the mineral kingdom, as those which relate to organic beings in the vegetable or animal kingdoms. It will however be convenient to retain the term Primary Rocks, when treating of g2"], [126, "84 CLASSIFICATION OF PRIMARY ROCKS. those rocks which, according to the present state of knowledge, are the foundation rocks of every coun try, although some of these rocks may occasionally make their appearance in the upper formations. Primary rocks are chiefly composed of the hard minerals, quartz, felspar, and hornblende ; the mi nerals, mica and talc, are disseminated in smaller proportions, and limestone and serpentine occur in beds or masses, but less frequently than the above named minerals. If we refer the slate rocks to the Transition Class, the few simple minerals here enu merated constitute nearly the whole of the moun tains denominated Primary. The structure of primary rocks is crystalline; they form the central parts of the most elevated moun tain chains, and they occur at the lowest depths that have yet been explored, and are hence believed to be the most ancient of rock formations. Werner has enumerated fourteen primary rocks : but as some of these have only been found hitherto in one place, it appears improper to consider them as distinct orders, unless we arrange every variety of rock in the same manner, and increase the num ber of orders indefinitely*. * The system of classification introduced by Werner, was formed principally from observations made in Saxony, and had great merit, as illustrating the geology of that part of Germany : but it has been objected with much reason to the general adop tion of the terms he employs, that they were framed to suit a particular theory, before a sufficient number of facts had been collected to warrant its reception.

The three principal rocks of the Primary Class, \u2014 granite, gneiss, and mica slate, \u2014 might with pro priety be regarded as belonging to one formation. They are essentially composed of the same mine rals varying in different proportions, and are rather modes of the same rock, than different species. They pass by gradation into each other, as one or other of their constituent minerals become more or less abundant ; they alternate with each other in various situations, and may be regarded as cotem poraneous. It may, however, for the convenience of description, be proper to treat of each separately. Rocks of thc First Class. Granite is considered as the foundation rock on which slate rocks and all secondary rocks are laid. From its great relative depth, granite is not fre quently met with, except in alpine situations, where it appears to have been forced through the more superficial covering of the globe. Where granite rises above the surface, the beds of other rocks in the same district generally rise towards it, and their angles of elevation increase as they approach nearer to it. Some writers derive the name from geranites, a word used by Pliny to denote a particular kind of stone; others, with more probability, suppose that the name originated from its granular structure, or the grains of which it is composed. Granite is composed of the three minerals described in the third chapter, \u2014 quartz, felspar, and mica; which are more or less perfectly crystallized, and closely united together. The three minerals of which granite is composed vary much in their proportions in different granitic"], [129, "GRANITE. 87 rocks; and often in specimens from the same rock the crystals are large, or small, or equally inter mixed, in one part, and in another part quartz or felspar greatly predominates. Some granites are composed of small grains, and have large crystals of felspar interspersed ; these are denominated Por phyritic Granites. Stones of this kind are common in the foot-pavements of London*. Felspar in general constitutes by far the largest part of granite : the more common colours are white and red; it is sometimes in a soft or decom posing- state, and appears earthy. In some granites the crystals of felspar are distinctly formed. Quartz generally occurs in small irregular-shaped grains, which have a vitreous lustre. The mica in granite occurs most commonly in small shining scales, which are most frequently either black, or whitish and silvery. It sometimes occurs in large hexagonal plates, but this is more commonly the case in the granite that forms veins in granitic mountains; such veins with large plates of mica are frequent near Aberdeen in Scotland. Mica readily separates or divides into thin transparent lamin\u00e6; and where the plates are very large, as in the Siberian granite, it * Specimens of Cornish and Scotch granites are not difficult to procure in London, as they are commonly used for paving stones. In the former the felspar is white ; the mica appears like glistening scales which have a tarnished semi-metallic lustre. The quartz has a vitreous appearance, and is of a light gray co lour. In Scotch granite the felspar has more commonly a red dish brown colour. The mica is not unfrequently black and splendent, and may be divided into thin scales by the point of a penknife : this distinguishes it from hornblende, which is some times intermixed with this granite."], [130, "88 VARIETIES OF GRANITE. is used instead of glass for windows. This variety is improperly called Muscovy Talc. Talc resembles mica, but is much softer. When the grains of felspar and other minerals are very minute in gra nite, it can scarcely be distinguished from sand stone. Beside the three minerals, quartz, felspar and mica, which were formerly considered as the es sential constituent parts of all true granite, whoever has attentively examined various granitic districts, must have frequently observed, that, other minerals occupy the place of mica either in part or entirely. Thus near the summit of Mont Blanc, the granite is composed of felspar, quartz, and talc or chlo rite, the latter mineral supplying the place of mica. To this variety of granite the name of Protogine has improperly been given ; whereas Talcy or Chloritic Granite would at once convey a distinct idea of its nature. In some instances, hornblende supplies the place of mica, or is intermixed with it. To this rock the name of Sienite was given, be cause a granitic rock of this kind from Sienna in Upper Egypt, was much used by the ancients for obelisks. The following varieties of granitic rocks are often associated with common granite in the same mountain mass, and may be regarded as cotempo raneous with it, being essentially the same rock, accidentally modified by an admixture with other simple minerals. Common Granite. \u2014 The felspar white or red, composed of quartz, felspar and mica. Porphyritic Granite, in which large crystals of"], [131, "VARIETIES OF GRANITE. 89 felpar occur in a small-grained granite. The granite from a mountain near Shap in Westmoreland offers an excellent type of this. Sienite or Sienitic Granite, in which horn blende, either wholly or in part, supplies the place of mica. The granite of Malvern and the Cham wood Forest hills afford specimens of this granite. Talcy or Chloride Granite. \u2014 Quartz, felspar, and talc or chlorite. Many of the granitic mountains in Savoy are composed of this granite ; and loose blocks of it are scattered over the valleys and on the sides and summits ofthe calcareous mountains in the countries to the north and north-west of the Alps. This granite is by some writers called Protogine. Felspathie Granite, in which the felspar is the principal ingredient, and the quartz, and particularly the mica, very rare; larger crystals of felspar occur in it. It is frequently nearly white. To this vari ety Werner has given the name of White Stone, \u2014 and the French, Eurite. It occurs in beds in com mon granite in Cornwall. In its most compact form, it becomes a porphyry, and is closely allied to volcanic rocks in Auvergne. Granite occurs in masses of vast thickness, which are commonly divided by fissures into blocks that approach to rhomboidal or pretty regular polyhe dral forms. Sometimes a columnar structure may be observed in granitic mountains ; in other in stances, where the quantity of mica is considerable, granite divides into parallel layers or plates, that have been mistaken for strata. Granite is occa sionally found in globular masses, which are com posed of concentric spherical layers, separated by"], [132, "90 ASPECT OF GRANITIC MOUNTAINS. granite of a less compact kind, and inclosing a hard or central nucleus. These globular masses are often three or four yards or more in diameter, and are either detached or imbedded in granite of a softer kind ; this structure is not peculiar to gra nite. The aspect of granitic mountains is extremely various : where the beds are nearly horizontal, or where the granite is soft and disintegrating, the summits are rounded, heavy, and unpicturesque. Where hard and soft granite are intermixed in the same mountain, the softer granite is disintegrated and falls away, and the harder blocks remain piled in confusion on each other, like an immense mass of ruins. Where the granite is hard, and the beds are nearly vertical and have a laminar structure, it forms lofty pyramidal peaks or aiguilles, that rise in enormous spires ; such are the aiguilles in the vi cinity of Mont Blanc, which are far more interest ing, both to the picturesque traveller or the Geolo gist, than Mont Blanc itself. The Aiguille de Dru is perhaps the most remarkable granitic mountain at present known ; the upper part or spire rises above its base nearly to a point in one solid shaft more than four thousand feet; the summit is eleven thousand feet above the level ofthe sea*. It has been observed in so many situations, that it may perhaps be regarded as a general law, \u2014 wherever granite rises high above the surface of the earth, the strata of limestone or other rocks in * A short description of this mountain, with a plate, is given in the 2d volume of \" Travels\" by the Author."], [133, "STRUCTURE OF MONT BLANC. 91 its vicinity rise towards it. Numerous instances of this occur in the Swiss Alps. In the higher part of the valley of Lanterbrun in the Canton of Berne, I have seen a bed of limestone in immediate junc tion with granite in a perfectly vertical position, like a wall built up against it. In many of the highest mountains in the northern or Swiss Alps, granite is only seen near their bases ; the summits are composed of immense beds of lime stone and secondary stratified rocks. In the south ern chain, or the Savoy Alps, the highest summits are granite ; indeed the highest known point at which granite has been observed in any part of the world is Mont Blanc in Savoy, the loftiest moun tain in Europe, rising fifteen thousand six hundred and eighty feet above the level of the sea, or nearly five times higher than any mountain in England or Wales. It was first ascended by Doctor Pacard in 1786, and afterwards by Saussure, who has pub lished a very interesting account of his ascent. Se veral persons have since ascended this mountain, but Saussure is the only traveller who has given us any information respecting its structure. I shall therefore insert a brief account of his observations; they are highly interesting. \u2014 He set out from the priory of Chamouni, from whence the distance to the summit of the mountain in a direct line is not more than two French leagues and a quarter : but owing to the difficulty of the ascent, it requires eighteen hours continued labour, exclusively of the time necessary for repose and refreshment. The first day's journey was comparatively easy, the route being over soil covered with vegetation, or bare"], [134, "92 STRUCTURE OF MONT BLANC. rocks. The ascent on the second day was over snow and ice, and more difficult : at four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, Saussure and his attendants pitched their tent on the second of the three great plains of snow which they had to tra verse. Here they passed the night, fourteen hun dred and fifty-five toises (or three thousand one hundred yards) above the level ofthe sea, and ninety toises higher than the Peak of Teneriffe. The barometer stood at seventeen inches. The next morning they proceeded with much difficulty and fatigue, arising principally from the extreme rarity of the atmosphere, which affected their respiration. The upper parts of Mont Blanc are above the li mits of perpetual snow, and it is only on the sides of the nearly perpendicular peaks and escarpments that the bare rock is visible. They gained the summit by eleven o'clock A.M. \"From this ele vated observatory,\" says Saussure, \" I could take in at one view, without changing my place, the whole of the grand ph\u00e6nomenon of these mountains ; namely, the position and arrangement of the beds of which they are composed. Wherever I turned my eyes, the beds of rock in the chains of secondary mountains, and even in the primary mountains of the second order, rise toward Mont Blanc and the lofty summits in its neighbourhood : the escarp ments of these beds of rock were all facing Mont Blanc ; but beyond these chains were others whose escarpments were turned in a contrary direction. Notwithstanding the irregularity in the forms and the distribution of the great masses that surround Mont Blanc, and those which constitute the moun-"], [135, "STRUCTURE OF MONT BLANC. 93 tain itself, I could trace some features of resem blance not less certain than important. All the masses which I could see were composed of vertical plates (feuillets), and the greater part of these plates were ranged in the same direction, from north-east to south-west. I had particular pleasure in ob serving the same structure in the lofty peak of gra nite called the Col du Midi, which I had formerly endeavoured, but in vain, to approach, being pre vented by inaccessible walls of granite. After the second day's ascent, this lofty pinnacle was beneath me ; and I fully convinced myself that it is entirely composed of magnificent plates (lames) of granite, perpendicular to the horizon and ranging from east to west. I had formerly been induced to believe that these plates were folded round the peak, like the leaves of an artichoke ; but this was an optical illusion, when seen imperfectly from below : here, where the eye could as it were dart down into the interior structure ofthe mountain, the plates of rock appeared regularly parallel in a direct line. I was also,\" says Saussure, \"particularly desirous of as certaining whether the vertical beds were composed of the same substances at their summits as at their bases, where I had so frequently inspected them ; and I am perfectly satisfied from actual examina tion, that they preserve the same nature through their whole extent, and are the same at the summit as below*.\" Voyages dans les Alpes, torn. 4. * The extreme fatigue and exhaustion which Saussure expe rienced during the ascent of Mont Blanc is supposed to have abridged the life of this active and intelligent philosopher."], [136, "94 VERTICAL BEDS OF GRANITE. The inference drawn by Saussure, respecting (he vertical position ofthe beds of granite that compose a principal part of Mont Blanc and the adjoining mountains, is, that they were originally horizontal, and have been subsequently elevated by some tre mendous convulsion of nature. The summit of Mont Blanc, he says, must at one time have been more than two leagues under the surface. To the same convulsion he also attributes the position of the escarpments or steep sides of the rocks which face Mont Blanc for a considerable extent, and then turn from it in an opposite direction. This would be the case had the surface ofthe globe been broken and elevated in the manner he supposes. There is a circumstance stated by Saussure, which tends strongly to confirm, if not absolutely to prove, the truth of his hypothesis. Some of the vertical beds of rock adjacent to the granite, contain round pebbles, boulders, andwaterworn pieces ofthe lower rocks. See observations on these beds, Chap. IV. It is impossible to conceive that those rounded fragments could have been placed in a vertical po sition ; for,- if they be really pebbles and boulders, the beds on which they occur, must originally have been nearly horizontal. Now as these beds are at present placed between others which are also ver tical and in the same range, it follows that the whole have been overturned and thrown up, at a period subsequent to their formation*. * An opinion has lately been advanced, that the rounded pebbles which occur in rocks are not really waterworn frag ments, but original parts of the rock : but Saussure says ex pressly, that the boulders in the rocks near Mont Blanc are"], [137, "GRANITE MOUNTAINS. 95 The Himmaleh Mountains in the centre of Asia rise ten thousand feet higher than any mountains in the Alps ; but where their summits are uncovered by snow, they are believed to be composed of se condary strata. Many of the mountains in the extensive range of the Andes in South America also rise much higher than Mont Blanc ; but granite has not been found there in a greater elevation than eleven thousand five hundred feet, an elevation exceeded by many of the granite mountains in Europe. The range of the Andes is the seat of active volcanic fires, which appear to have covered the primary mountains with an immense mass of matter, ejected by ancient and recent eruptions. In Mexico and New Spain also, the granite appears to be nearly covered by basalt, porphyry, and lava, ejected from the numerous volcanoes which now exist, or have existed, in those countries. To this accumulation of volcanic matter the mountains in South America owe their superior elevation. Chimborasso and Cayambo are the highest mountains in the world, \u2014 the former rises twenty-one thousand four hundred and forty feet, \u2014 but their summits are vast cones composed of vol canic productions covered with snow. Chimborasso is one mile and one hundred and sixty yards higher precisely similar to the boulders on the shores of the lake of Geneva. That rocks sometimes include pieces of different kinds of stone, which in fact are original parts of the rock, cannot be doubted; but in such cases there appears a gradual transition, from the substance of the rock, into the stone which appears im bedded."], [138, "96 LOCALITIES OF GRANITE. than Mont Blanc. The general arrangement of the Andes consists, according to Humboldt, of gra nite, gneiss, mica, and clay slate, as in the Alps ; but on these are frequently laid porphyry and ba salt, \"arranged in the form of regular and immense columns, which strike the eye of the traveller like the ruins of enormous castles lifted into the sky.\" In the eastern parts ofthe United States, and in Canada, granite is seen near the surface uncovered by other rocks, and does not rise to any great ele vation. The constant occurrence of granite at a lower level in America than in Europe, is a re markable geological fact. In Europe the central part of the principal mountain ranges are granite ; as in Scandinavia, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Carpathian mountains. In Asia, granite forms a considerable part of the Uralian and Altaic range of mountains, and it appears to compose the prin cipal mountains that have been examined in Africa. The parts of England and Wales where granite and granitic rocks occur, are Cornwall, Devonshire, North Wales, Anglesea, the Malvern Hills in Wor cestershire, Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, and in Cumberland and Westmoreland. The gra nite near Shap in Westmoreland is porphyritic, containing large crystals of red felspar. There are rolled masses of granite on the banks of Ulswater resembling the granite of some parts of Cornwall, and of the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, but more highly crystalline than the latter. The felspar is in large white and reddish-white crystals. The mica is a blackish green, and on the outer parts decom posed. There is no similar rock in the vicinity"], [139, "GRANITE VEINS. 97 known in situ. It has all the characters given by mineralogists to primary granite*. I am inclined to believe that the same formation of granite which just makes its appearance on the western side of South Britain is continued under the Irish Channel ; or if broken there, it rises again in the Isle of Man, and in the counties of Dublin and Wicklow in Ire land. Blocks of granite are found in the beds of some of the rivers in the north-west part of York shire, and in clay-pits in Lancashire and Cheshire, at a great distance from any granite mountains. Most of the granitic rocks on Charnwood Forest are of that kind denominated sienitef. Granite sometimes forms veins shooting up into the superincumbent rocks. This is a fact of some geological importance, as it seems to indicate, either that the granite has been in a state of fusion, the heat of which has softened and rent the upper rocks, and forced up the granite in a melted state into these fissures ; or else that the granite and the rocks rest ing immediately upon it, were both in a fluid state at the same time, and are cotemporaneous. A re markable instance of granitic veins in argillaceous * Since the publication of the former editions of this work, granite ofa similar kind has been discovered forming the base of Skiddaw and other mountains in Cumberland. t According to Brongniart, granite, sienite, and porphyry, are frequently observed graduating into each other in some parts of France ; and he forms this conclusion : \"En etudiant les granites d'un grand nombre de pays pour tacher de distinguer clairement les anciens granites des nouveaux, on trouve presque peu de pays granitiques qu'on puisse rapporter avec certitude a cette ancienne et primitive formation des granites.\" Journal des Mines, Mars 1814. Il"], [140, "98 GRANITE VEINS. schistus at Mouschole in Cornwall, is described in Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, May 1814. \" The schistus is ofa grayish colour, rather hard, but breaks in large fragments in the direction of the strata. The granite is of a fine grain, and the felspar is of a light flesh colour, and contains but a small portion of mica. At the junction numerous veins of granite may be traced from the rock of gra nite into the schist. Some of these veins may be observed upwards of fifty yards, till they are lost in the sea ; and in point of size, vary from a foot and a half to less than an inch. It may deserve notice, that, as the felspar is of a flesh colour, it is impos sible for any observer to consider them as quartz veins : one of these large veins is dislocated, and heaved several feet by a cross course. Quartz and fragments of schistus having the appearance of veins are found in the granite veins. At one place there is a very curious and satisfactory ph\u00e6nomenon. One of these veins of granite, after proceeding vertically some distance, suddenly forms an angle and con tinues in a direction nearly horizontal for several feet, with schistus both above and below it. This appearance most completely destroys one of the theories suggested for the explanation of similar veins at St. Michael's Mount, viz. that a ridge of projecting granite had been left, and schistus de posited afterwards on its sides.\" In 1816 I visited the place, which is close by the sea side, at low water, and observed some appear ances which I believe have not hitherto been noticed. The junction of the granite rock and the schist may be distinctly seen : they form together a sloping"], [141, "GRANITE VEINS. 99 beach uncovered by any fragments : the line of junction is waving from the coast into the sea, as re presented Plate2. fig. 3. G.theGranite, s. the Schist. It is truly worthy of notice, that the veins of gra nite may be distinctly seen penetrating both the schist and the granite ; for the granite in the veins is finer-grained than the granite rock, and may as easily be distinguished from it in the granite, as in the schist. The granite rock itself is smaller-grained near the line of junction of the two rocks, than it is a little distance from it, where it contains large white crystals of felspar in a smaller-grained reddish granite. What is further remarkable, the largest granite vein in passing into the schist, cuts through a vein of quartz thicker than itself; and. a few yards nearer the sea, a small quartz vein cuts through the same granite vein : see Plate 2. fig. 3. What is called the schist or killas in Cornwall, in the places where I have observed it in immediate junction with gra nite, is highly indurated and of a dark colour, and appears to have been changed by the junction: it has no appearance of slate; \u2014 indeed the change in the size of the grain of granite, as the latter ap proaches the killas atMouschole, would indicate that the two rocks were passing into each other. Per haps the best designation of the killas rock on this situation is, that ofa minutely grained and highlyin durated gneiss, that had lost its schistose character. Granite veins of large size traverse granite rocks in the vicinity of Aberdeen : in these veins both the felspar and mica occur in crystalline plates and la minae of considerable magnitude, accompanied with tourmaline. At Glen til in Scotland, a singular inter- h 2"], [142, "100 SECONDARY GRANITE. mixture of granite in veins and amorphous masses occurs with slate and limestone, and has been de scribed by Dr. MacCulloch in the Geological Trans actions, vol. 1. page 145. It seems impossible to conceive how masses of granite could be intermixed with, or imbedded in limestone, without admitting that the two substances have been both in a fluid or semi-fluid state at the same time, by whatever cause we may suppose this fluidity to have been effected. Such instances may make us feel less surprised at meeting with entire beds of granite in other rocks. Some geologists describe the granite under gneiss and the granite over gneiss as different formations ; but as gneiss is itself a schistose granite, it would be more correct to state, that the massive and schistose granite sometimes occur alternatingwith each other. When the mica becomes abundant, the granite passes to the state of gneiss ; when the felspar and quartz predominate, it becomes again massive or common granite. What has been said respecting the alternation of gneiss and granite, will apply to the alternation of granite and mica-slate. In the latter, the felspar is wanting; but if it reappear, it becomes either gra nite or gneiss. Mica-slate also passes by such in sensible gradations into slate, that the occasional occurrence of granite in some ancient slate-rocks may admit of a similar explanation. We shall thus sweep away the secondary granites, which have so much bewildered the systems of many Geologists : indeed nothing can appear more puerile and trifling, than the labour of making distinctions, where Na-"], [143, "EURITE, OR FELSPAR PORPHYRY. 101 ture has made none. Of this we have an instance in the distinctive characters which have been given of primary and secondary granite. Primary Granite. 1. Sometimes red. 2. Contains garnets. 3. Is sometimes porphyritic. Secondary Granite. 1. Felspar commonly adeep red. 2. Contains garnets. 3. Not porphyritic ; but accord- ing to Professor Jamieson is sometimes porphyritic. Again, M. D'Aubuisson tells us, that the colour of primary granite is almost always white. What has been advanced may be sufficient to prove that the attempts to distinguish primary from secondary granite by their mineral characters, are worse than useless ; as they waste the time of the learner, and tend to disgust him with a science al ready too heavily burdened with unmeaning terms and frivolous distinctions. There is a particular form of granite, in which the constituent parts are so minute and so intimately mixed, that it appears very minutely granular or even compact : to this variety the French Geolo- gists have given the name o\u0152urite; it has generally been described by English Geologists as Compact felspar, into which it passes by insensible grada- tions. This rock frequently contains large imbedded crystals of felspar, and forms what has been deno- minated felspar-porphyry. In Cornwall it occurs in beds in common granite ; but instead of being re- garded as a different rock, it may be more properly classed by the Geologist with granite, being only a variety in which felspar greatly predominates. This rock occurs also in an unconformable position, and"], [144, "102 SIENITIC GRANITE. is generally described as porphyry, and appears to form a connecting link between common granite and the compact varieties of volcanic porphyry, with a base of felspar called by the French Trachyte. Sienitic granite, in which the mica is partly or entirely replaced by hornblende, in some situations occurs with common granite in the same bed, and therefore must be regarded as a variety of granite. Instances of this change from granite to sienite in the same rock, I have frequently observed in the granite of Charnwood Forest. The same change may also be noticed in the granite of the Malvern Hills. That able and accurate observer Dr. Mac- Culloch maintains the identity of granite and sienite, from their frequent passage into each other in the same rocks in Scotland. When the hornblende be comes abundant and is closely intermixed with fel spar, it forms a dark finely granular rock, which has been denominated trap or greenstone : it nearly re sembles basalt. In the Charnwood Forest hills, and at Shap in Westmoreland, well defined granite may be seen passing into a dark coloured trap-rock near- ly compact. I have even broken offhand specimens in which one part was granite and the other trap, and the passage from one to the other might be di stinctly observed. The crystallized earthy minerals which occur most frequently in granite, are schorl or tourma line, and pinite, a mineral nearly allied to mica, \u2014 the emerald, corindon, axinite, and topaz, are also found occasionally in granite. Sometimes the tourmaline is so abundantly disseminated, as to form a constituent part of the rock. Pinite occurs"], [145, "EARTHY GRANITE. 103 in considerable quantities in the earthy decompo sing granites of Auvergne. Common granite, or massive granite, contains few beds of any other rock, nor is it rich in metal lic ores. Tin ore, however, chiefly occurs in gra nite, either in veins accompanying quartz, or dis seminated through the rock at a distance from the veins. Ores of other metals, as copper, iron, wol fram, bismuth.and silver, are also occasionally found in granite. Granite supplies durable materials for architec ture; but it varies much in hardness, and care is required in its selection. I was told when in Corn wall, that granite got from a considerable depth in the quarry is so soft when it is first raised, that it can be easily sawed into blocks, but it soon acquires great hardness by exposure to the air. In the moun tains of Auvergne, the granite is extremely soft, and the felspar appears earthy ; this is probably the original state of the stone. I believe it is the soft earthy granite from this district which supplies the Kaolin used in the Porcelain manufacture at Sevres. Mons. Brongniart, who obligingly accompanied me through the works, showed me a specimen oftheir best kaolin : it contained crystals of pinite. I had recently arrived from Auvergne, and I thought I recognised its locality. Though granite may be regarded as the lowest known rock formation, yet it is certain, that in many countries the seat of volcanic fire is placed below granite. In Auvergne and a large part of central France, the foundation rock is granite; but it has been pierced through by numerous ancient"], [146, "104 SUBTERRANEAN FIRE BENEATH GRANITE. volcanoes, which have poured currents of lava over its surface, and covered other parts with loose scori\u00e6 and black volcanic sand. Some of the currents of Java appear as fresh as the recent currents from Etna or Vesuvius. In other parts of Auvergne the granite appears to have been acted upon by sub terranean fire in situ; and in some mountains, as in the Puy de Chopine near Riom, granite and volcanic rocks are intermixed, one part being true granite and the other volcanic porphyry, (trachyte*.) The volcanoes have long been dormant, and the only remaining proofs of the existence of subterra nean fires under that district are the hot springs that rise in the vicinity of the ancient volcanoes. According to Humboldt, in the Canary Islands, as well as in the Andes of Quito, in Greece, and va rious parts of the world, subterranean fires have pierced through the primary rocks ; and he adduces the great number of warm springs which he has seen issuing from Granite, Gneiss and Mica-slate, as a proof of this opinion. Indeed, in the Andes numerous volcanoes are in present activity, from Cape Horn to Mexico, and it is probable that those mountains owe their elevation to subterranean fire ; for we have a recent instance of the mighty power of this agent to upheave the crust of the globe. During the earthquake in Chili in November 1822, the whole line of coast running north and south from Valparaiso, to the distance of one hundred miles, was raised above its former level ; and the bottom of the * See \"Travels in the Tarentaise and Auvergne,\" vol. ii. p. 3C7."], [147, "105 THERMAL WATERS OF THE ALPS. sea was laid dry, and shells were discovered sticking to the rocks, some of which were not before known in those seas. It is stated by an ob'server, that the whole country, from the coast to the feet of the Andes and even far out to sea, was permanently raised by the earthquake ; the greatest rise was about two miles from the shore. The granite which forms the foundation rock was rent in parallel fissures. The earthquake is estimated to have ex tended over an area of one hundred thousand miles. The average rise of the land upon the coast was from two to five feet, at a distance of a mile from the shore inland the elevation was seven feet. During my residence in Savoy and Switzerland in the years 1820, -21, and -22. I was desirous to as certain whether there were any vestiges of the ac tion of subterranean fires in the Alps. In the part of the great southern chain, extending from near the source of the Rhone to the Little St. Bernard, there does not occur in the numerous situations which I examined, or from which I have seen spe cimens, any minerals of a volcanic character, with the doubtful exception of some rocks in the valley of Saass and in the Valorsine. Though I could observe no indications of vol canic fire in the rocks themselves, I was greatly surprised with a circumstance that, as far as I know, had escaped the attention of geologists. Along the whole line of Alps before mentioned, which extends for one hundred and twenty miles, nume rous hot springs are gushing out at the feet of the primary mountains near the junction of the lowest secondary limestone, with schistose rocks passing"], [148, "106 INDrCATION OF THE AGENT into mica and talcous slate. It was known that a few thermal waters existed in the Valois and in Savoy; but they^ were regarded as isolated ph\u00e6no mena, and their geological position had not been attended to. Since Saussure visited the Alps, ther mal waters have been discovered in various situa tions; and since I left Savoy, another considerable warm spring has been opened in the vicinity of the village of Chamouni near the foot ofa glacier. There is also further reason to believe that ther mal waters would be found in all the deep valleys ofthe Alps near the junction of the primary and secondary rocks, were they not covered by eboule ments under heaps of loose stones, as was the case with the warm baths in the valley of Bagnes in the Bas Valois; or were not the temperature ofthe warm springs reduced by admixture with torrents from the glaciers. In vol. i. chap. 8. of my \"Travels in Savoy/Thave described the geological position of nine of the principal known thermal waters of the Alps ; their temperature varies from 94\u00b0 to!26\u00b0Fahrenheit. The quantity of water which issues from these springs is very considerable, and the thawing of the bottom of the glaciers during intense frost, may I believe be attributed to the action of thermal waters. On the Italian side ofthe same range of Alps, particularly at St. Didider, near the steep southern escarpment of Mont Blanc, there are several thermal waters ; and further west than the hot springs at Aix in Savoy, other hot springs have been recently disco vered near Grenoble. It thus seems probable that there still exists under this range of the Alps one"], [149, "WHICH HAS ELEVATED MOUNTAINS. 107 common source of heat, to the agency of which in remote ages, the mountains originally owed their elevation ; for we can scarcely doubt that the hot springs in the Alps, like those in Auvergne, in Italy, or Iceland, derive their great temperature from sub terranean fire. This inference is farther supported by the well authenticated fact, that the districts in which the hot springs are situated, have been sub ject to great and frequent convulsions. In the year 1755 the ground in the vicinity of the hot springs of Leuk and Naters, in the Upper Valois, was agi tated with earthquakes every day from the lst of November to the 27th of February. Churches were thrown down, the springs were dried up, and the waters of the Rhone were observed to boil in several places. The mountain above the warm spring at Naters is said to have opened and dis charged a quantity of hot water. The hot springs at the feet of the Pyrenees may derive their temperature from the same source as those on the Pennine Alps; the country that sepa rates the Alps and the Pyrenees is in many parts volcanic. What has been here advanced, may be sufficient to show the high probability, that the elevation of the vertical beds in the Alps has been effected by subterranean fire, \u2014 an agent which we have direct proof has in our own times elevated considerable portions of the crust of the globe ; and it were con trary to the rules of sound philosophy to seek for other causes, than those which are now existing, when such causes are adequate to the production of all the ph\u00e6nomena we observe."], [150, "IOS CHAPTER VI.

IHE principal primary rocks enumerated with granite in the preceding chapter were Gneiss and Mica-slate. With these, certain rocks are frequently associated, and are therefore regarded as cotempo raneous ; for where one rock occurs imbedded in another, it is evident that the inclosed rock must be as ancient as the rock which enfolds it ; and therefore if one be primary, the other must also be primary, unless the imbedded rock be volcanic. Gneiss received its name from the German miners : according to Mr. Jameson, the decomposed stone on the sides of some metallic veins was first so called ; but Werner designated by this term a schistose or slaty granite, abounding in mica. Granite fre quently passes into gneiss by an almost impercep tible gradation : where the quantity of felspar de creases and the crystals or grains become smaller, if the mica increases in quantity, and is arranged in layers, the rock loses the massive structure, and becomes schistose; we have then a true gneiss. By"], [151, "GNEISS. 109 the reverse of this process, if the quantity of felspar increases, and the mica diminishes, the rock loses the schistose structure and becomes massive ; and we have granite again. Some geologists call this secondary granite, but the upper and lower granite, and the gneiss are in this instance but different modes ofthe same rock. The granite of the Alps which Saussure calls granite veine, is properly an incipient state of gneiss ; the mica is arranged in parallel layers, varying in distance from each other; when they approach very near, they form what in hand speci mens is called true gneiss. When the parallel lay ers of mica are at some distance from each other, they give a striped appearance to the rock. Lamin\u00e6 of quartz of considerable thickness sometimes se parate the felspar from the mica, and occasionally masses of quartz are imbedded in gneiss. When the mica becomes very abundant, and the other constituent parts are small in size and quantity, gneiss passes into mica-slate ; \u2014 gneiss has often a waved form. This rock has been represented as stratified, I conceive, by a mistake in confounding the stratified with the slaty structure : the latter is occasioned by the quantity of mica and sometimes of talc which it contains, and is the effect of cry stallization*. * The partings or divisions in rocks, which may properly be denominated rents, are distinct from those which are the effect of crystallization, and may be distinguished by their irregularity, roughness, and the indeterminate manner in which they inter sect the stone."], [152, "110 GNEISS AND MICA-SLATE. Beds of crystalline limestone, and of hornblende rock, occur in gneiss. It contains most of the me tallic ores, both in veins and beds. Crystals of garnets are frequently interspersed in gneiss, but are more common in micaceous schist, which is nearly allied to this rock. The declivities of granite mountains are covered by rocks of gneiss in many parts of the world. Gneiss constitutes the principal rock-formation in a considerable part of Sweden. It occurs in Scotland and Ireland, but is scarcely known in any part of England or Wales. Very well characterized gneiss occurs in the vicinity of Aberdeen. An imper fectly formed gneiss is found on the Malvern Hills. I have also seen gneiss brought from the lower part of Skiddaw in Cumberland. Mountains of gneiss are not so steep and broken as those of granite, and the summits are generally rounded. Mica-slate or Micaceous schistus is frequently incumbent on gneiss or granite, and covered by common slate : it passes by gradation into both these rocks, \u2014 the coarser-grained resembling gneiss, and the finer kind, by insensible transition, becoming clay-slate. Mica-slate is essentially composed of mica and quartz intimately combined; the felspar, which is a principal constituent part of granite and gneiss, occurs only occasionally in irregular masses in this rock. The colour of mica-slate is generally a light gray, inclining sometimes to green or yellow ; the finer kinds have a pearly lustre ; \u2014 in the coarser kind the lamin\u00e6 of mica are more distinct and"], [153, "MICA-SLATE. 111 splendent. Crystals of garnet are frequently disse minated in mica-slate : it contains occasionally cry stals of other minerals. It has a slaty structure, and is often waved and contorted, and divided by thin lamin\u00e6 of quartz. It sometimes contains beds and lamin\u00e6 of crystalline limestone,* or is intermixed with serpentine. Mica-slate also frequently contains beds and veins of metallic ores. The gradation of mica-slate into gneiss and clay-slate, and the transi tion from granite to mica-slate, may be distinctly seen in some of the rocks near Bray, in the county of Wicklow in Ireland. I have observed that the beds of mica-slate adjoining the granite are tra versed by numerous and large seams of quartz run ning parallel with the slaty structure of the rock, and increasing in size as they approach the gra nite. The quartz has a greasy aspect, and is evi dently of cotemporaneous formation with the mica slate and granite. Mica-slate has a near affinity to clay-slate ; and as I have arranged the latter with rocks of the se cond class, it may perhaps be doubted whether mica-slate should not also have been transferred to the same class. No well characterized rocks of mica-slate of any extent occur in England. I have observed a micaceous rock, which may be consi dered as an imperfect kind of mica-slate near the granitic rocks of Mount Soar Hill ; but it was co vered by wood, which concealed its junction with other rocks. On the western side of Anglesea, near Holyhead, there are numerous rocks of an in termediate kind between mica-slate and talcose slate. The lamin\u00e6 are separated by very thin"], [154, "112 MICA-SLATE. seams of quartz ; and I have observed some of them bent and contorted in various directions, as is not unfrequently the case with mica-slate in other dis tricts. The mica-slate on the opposite coast of Ireland, near Bray, I am inclined to consider as of the same formation with that in Anglesea. Probably this rock stretches under the Irish Channel, of which it may form the bed in that parallel of latitude. The structure of both rocks is the same, presenting the same divisions by thin lamin\u00e6 of quartz ; but the mica of Anglesea is more combined with talc. Mica-slate abounds in the Highlands of Scotland, and in many alpine districts in Europe, particularly in the Pennine Alps. Gneiss and mica-slate are nearly allied lo each other and to granite. Circumstances attending the formation of granite appear to have produced a different arrangement of the component ingredients. This is the more probable, as both gneiss and mica slate sometimes graduate into granite, and have at other times a porphyritic structure. In some situ ations the causes which change granite into gneiss or mica-slate have not operated, and we find neither of these substances separating granite from the rocks ofthe next class. Mica is nearly allied to talc, and mica-slate fre quently passes by insensible gradations into talc slate or talcy mica-slate : a considerable part of the granite of Mont Blanc is of this kind. Gneiss and mica-slate being nearly similar in their constituent parts and geological position, \u2014 most of the metallic ores and minerals that occur in"], [155, "113 PRIMARY LIMESTONE. one rock, occur also in the other. Crystalline limestone, hornblende, talc, and serpentine, more frequently form beds in mica-slate than in gneiss. The waved structure is very common in mica-slate, and the beds are often most singularly bent and contorted. Crystalline or primary limestone, of which sta tuary marble is a variety, occurs principally form ing beds in primary mountains ; beds of this mi neral occur rarely in granite, more frequently in gneiss, but are most common in mica-slate, with which rock it is often much intermixed, and often alternates with it. It is observed that the primary limestone in granite and gneiss, is coarser grained than that in mica-slate or common slate. Primary limestone is often much intermixed with serpen tine. When beds of primary limestone occur of considerable thickness, they sometimes contain veins of metallic ores. Crystalline or primary limestone when pure is composed of calcareous earth, which scarcely exists as a component part of granite, gneiss, or mica slate. No organic remains are found in the cry stalline limestone in primary mountains; the struc ture is granular; the white variety known as statuary marble resembles fine loaf-sugar, and is imperfectly translucent ; hence it has been called by the French chaux carbonatee saccaroide. The colour of pri mary limestone is sometimes yellowish, greenish, or inclining to red. From a mixture of mica it has often a slaty fracture and divides in plates, from which circumstance it has been described as strati fied, \u2014 a term not applicable to rocks that are granu- i"], [156, "114 PRIMARY LIMESTONE. lar and purely crystalline. It may be further de serving notice, that primary limestone or statuary marble frequently contains a considerable quan tity of siliceous earth, to which it owes its hard ness and durability. While crystalline statuary marble occurs in the Isle of Sky, one of the He brides, and many rocks of crystalline marble inter mixed with mica-slate and serpentine, are found in different parts of Scotland. Neither in England nor Wales have any rocks of limestone been found which possess the crystalline translucent qualities of statuary marble, though very beautiful marbles occur which will receive a high polish ; these belong to the limestone which will be described in the fol lowing chapter. White marble is procured from Italy, Switzer land, and the Gr\u00e6cian Archipelago. Primary lime stone exists in beds of greater or less magnitude, which are sometimes so thick as to form entire mountains. It was once supposed that all calca reous rocks and strata are composed of the shells of marine animals, and it cannot be doubted that many of them are entirely formed of these organic remains : but in the beds of primary limestone, and even in some of the secondary limestones, no ves tiges of such remains occur. It may be said that the process by which primary limestone was cry stallized, destroyed all traces of organization ; and though it would be impossible to disprove this, yet there is no reason to believe that lime may not exist as an elementary earth, like silex or alumine, inde pendent of the operations of animal life. It does so exist as a component part of many minerals, and it"], [157, "115 FORMATION OF LIMESTONE. may have existed in sufficient quantity, to form the mountains of primary limestone. It is however a curious but undoubted fact, that no inconsiderable portion of the earth's surface has been formed by organic secretion, and the process is still going on rapidly and extensively in the Southern Ocean. According to the observations of voyagers, islands and reefs of coral rocks are raised from vast depths in the course of a few years. Thus, millions of minute marine polypi are preparing future abodes for other classes of animals of larger size, and living in another element. From whence do these innu merable zoophytes and moluscous animals procure the lime which, mixt with a small portion of animal matter, forms the solid covering by which they are protected ? Have they the power of separating it from other substances, or the still more extraordinary faculty of producing it from simple elements ? The latter I consider as more probable; for the polypi which accumulate rocks of coral from unfathomable depths have no power of locomotion ; their growth is rapid, and the quantity of calcareous matter they produce in a short space of time, can scarcely be supposed to exist in the waters ofthe ocean to which they have access, as sea-water contains but a minute portion of lime. It is now ascertained that lime and the other earths are compounds of oxygen united with metallic bases; and the brilliant discoveries of Sir H. Davy respect ing the metallic nature of ammonia, would lead to the conclusion that the metallic bases of all the alka lies and alkaline earths, which have many properties i 2"], [158, "116 SERPENTINE. in common, may, like ammonia, be compounds of hydrogen and azote, but differently combined. Now it is well known that hydrogen and azote, which exist as elementary constituent parts of almost all animal substances, may be derived from water and the atmosphere; and should the compound nature of the metallic bases of the earths be ascertained, the formation of lime by animal secretion, will admit of an easy explanation. Serpentine derives its name from its variegated colours and spots supposed to resemble the serpent's skin : its chemical composition has been before de scribed. The colours are most generally various shades of light and dark green, which are intermixt in spots and clouds ; some varieties are red. When fresh broken it has some degree of lustre, and a slightly unctuous feel ; when pounded, the powder feels soapy. It is harder than limestone, but yields to the point of a knife, and will receive a very high polish. When serpentine is found intermixt with patches of crystalline white marble, it constitutes a stone denominated verde-antique, which is highly valued for ornamental sculpture. Some varieties of serpentine are translucent, in others there is an appearance of crystallization, forming a mineral called diallage or schiller-spar. The minerals as sociated with serpentine are generally those allied to talc. Compound rocks in which talc and horn blende are predominating ingredients, pass into serpentine. Magnesia enters largely into the com position of these rocks. A late analysis of one kind of serpentine, gave 48 per cent of this earth. Ser-"], [159, "117 SERPENTINE. pentine chiefly occurs in gneiss and mica-slate, in beds which are frequently so thick as to compose mountain masses of considerable height. Serpen time sometimes becomes magnetic, from an intimate intermixture with minute particles of magnetic iron stone. Many of the alpine districts in Europe contain rocks and beds of serpentine; but accord ing to Patrin, there is no serpentine in Northern Asia, nor was it seen by Humboldt in the Andes; but it is not uncommon in the United States of North America. In the Alps it is observed that the rocks of serpentine lie principally on that side which faces Italy and the coast of Genoa. There is a soft kind of serpentine, sufficiently tenacious to be turned in a lathe into vessels of any shape, which resist the action of fire : hence they are used for culinary and other purposes in some parts of Switzerland, in Lombardy, and even in Higher Egypt. The use of this stone is of great antiquity, being distinctly mentioned by Pliny ; it is called lapis ollaris, or pot-stone. In Cornwall serpentine occurs with a micaceous rock lying over granite, and forms part of the pro montory called the Lizard Point. It is not met with in any other part of England that I know of; but I have observed rocks approaching the nature of ser pentine in Charnwood Forest, and in the county of Radnor in Wales. Beautiful varieties of red and green serpentine occur in the Isle of Anglesea, about six miles from the Paris copper-mine. It is found in beds of great thickness associated with the common slate-rocks of"], [160, "118 EUPHOTIDE OR SAUSSUR1TE. the district, which approach in their nature to tal cous slate: asbestus lies in considerable quantities in the partings between the beds of serpentine. Some of the specimens of this serpentine have the characters of the precious or noble serpentine ; the colours are principally dark green, intermixt with spots and clouds of lighter green, and shining lamin\u00e6 of schiller-spar or crystallized serpentine. The fracture is conchoidal, and it is translucent at the edges. It resists the point ofa copper or brass tool, and breaks with great difficulty. Some va rieties contain crystalline limestone, but in smaller patches than in the Italian verde-antique ; occa sional stripes and spots of steatite, asbest, and quartz, occur in it. The red is sometimes intermixt with a great variety of other rich colours in the same stone, as black, white, greenish white, and dark green. It may be considered as a valuable stone for pur poses of ornamental architecture, for in beauty and durability it is not exceeded by the costly marbles of Greece or Italy. By a mixture of serpentine with talc or steatite, serpentine becomes soft and sectile, and forms the mineral called potstone before mentioned. A diffe rent combination of crystallized serpentine (diallage) with jade or felspar, forms one of the hardest and heaviest of known rocks. It was first noticed by Saussure in rounded pieces and loose blocks, scat tered over several parts of the valley near the Lake of Geneva ; to this mineral the name of Saussurite has been given. It is much harder than quartz, and its specific gravity is 335 : the colour gene-"], [161, "119 HORNBLENDE ROCK. rally inclines to green. For a considerable time it was unknown where this rock occurred in situ; it has since been discovered in immense beds, as sociated with serpentine, in the valley of Sass in the Haut Valois. Beds of the same rock occur on the southern side of the Alps and in the Apennines. A very interesting description of the saussurite and serpentine of the Apennines has been published by M. Brongniart, entitled Sur le Gisement ou Position relative des Ophiolites, Euphotides et Jaspes, dans quelques Parties des Appenins*. In these moun tains, the serpentine rests upon saussurite, the saus surite on strata of jasper, and the latter on transi tion or secondary limestone. This position is re markable, for geologists had generally supposed that all serpentines were more ancient than the se condary rocks. Hornblende rock and Hornblende slate. \u2014 This mineral has been described Chap. III. When it forms the principal parts of rocks, the colour is com monly a greenish black. Massive hornblende in rocks is generally coarsely granular and lamellar ; in horn blende slate it is frequently radiated or fibrous, and when the fibres are very minute it has a velvet-like lustre. Hornblende slate occurs in beds in granite, gneiss, and mica-slate, and occasionally in common slate it appears to pass by gradation into serpen- * It is to be regretted that so excellent an observer and mineralogist as M. Brongniart, who is so justly eminent for his scientific labours, should have thought it necessary to burden Geology with two additional new names. Serpentine he has denominated ophiolite, and saussurite euphotide."], [162, "120 HORNBLENDE ROCK. tine ; the change is effected by an increase of mag nesia, which forms one of the constituent parts of hornblende. Hornblende in large lamellar grains, intermixed with felspar, forms sienite, which it was remarked in the last chapter is not unfrequently associated with granite : the passage of one rock into the other by the increase or decrease of felspar, may fre quently be observed in the same mountain. When hornblende and felspar are more intimately blended, they form the rock called by the Germans Green stone, by the French Diabase; and with other rocks of similar composition are frequently described as trap-rocks, and by the French as roches amphibo liques: these will be more properly noticed in the subsequent chapters. When the hornblende and felspar are so closely and minutely intermixed that the rock appears homogeneous, the trap has all the external character of a rock (hereafter to be more fully described) called Basalt*. In examining the geological specimens of Saussure in the museum at Geneva, I observed that the rocks which he so fre quently mentions under the name of Corneene, are * The rock to which the French give the name of Diabase, the compact trap of Werner, resembles basalt (which the French call Dolerite) so closely both in composition and physical cha racters, that the division into two species seems principally made to serve the purpose of theory. Diabase is composed of felspar and hornblende, and dolerite of felspar and augite intimately combined. But as hornblende and augite do not differ more in chemical composition, than one species of hornblende differs from another, and as these two minerals are only to be distin guished by their crystallization ; when they occur uucrystallized,"], [163, "PRIMARY PORPHYRY. 121 mixtures of hornblende and felspar, in which the former mineral predominates. Hornblende intermixed with felspar, forming sienite and greenstone, occurs at the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire, at the Charnwood Forest hills in Leicestershire, and in Cornwall, Cumberland. and North and South Wales. Very little well cha racterized hornblende slate is found in any part of England, but it occurs abundantly in the alpine parts of Scotland, and in most of the principal mountain ranges in Europe. The various intermixtures of hornblende and felspar, to which the name of trap rocks is frequently given, may more properly be classed with transition rocks. Porphyry derives its name from a Greek word denoting purple ; the rock to which it was at first applied had a purple colour. In the modern accep tation of the term, any rock which is compact or finely granular, and contains distinct imbedded cry stals, is called Porphyry, whatever be its colour. The base or paste of most porphyritic rocks is fel spar ; and the imbedded crystals are also felspar, though there may be also small grains or crystals of other minerals. It has been stated in the preced- may they not be regarded as identical ? It is true, augite occurs abundantly in rocks of undoubted igneous origin and in the lavas of recent volcanoes ; hornblende occurs also in basaltic lavas, but more frequently in rocks of which the igneous origin is not generally admitted : yet it may be fairly doubted, whether the distinction between compact diabase, and compact dolerite, has not been made in order to form gratuitous conclusions respect ing the different origin of rocks, which are in chemical composi tion and external character essentially the same."], [164, "122 RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ROCKS IN ing chapter, that granite, by becoming finer grained, frequently passes to the state of porphyry. The eurite ofthe French geologists, and the weiss-stein or white stone of Werner, is a granite in which the felspar is the principal constituent part, and is either finely granular or nearly compact. To this variety English geologists give the name of compact fel spar : the white elvan of the Cornish miners is a porphyritic eurite. Geologists have described four formations of porphyry, but it is generally agreed that there is much uncertainty with respect to the situation of these formations. The porphyry which occurs im bedded in granite, or which appears to be formed by a change of structure in that rock, may properly be classed with primary rocks : it is not considered to be an extensive formation ; the white elvan of Corn wall, and probably the porphyry associated with mica-slate in Argyleshire, belong to this formation. Porphyry also occurs in enormous masses covering both pri mary and transition rocks unconformably ; but this porphyry belongs more properly to transition rocks, and will be described with them in the following chapters. Porphyry is sometimes a volcanic rock, and appears to form the connecting gradation be tween granitic rocks, and those of igneous origin. Before taking leave ofthe rocks classed as Prima ry, it may be proper to notice that some of the rocks associated with granite, gneiss, and mica-slate, occur also in the transition class, and even in the lower secondary strata. The same causes by which they were formed among primary rocks, have also ope rated at a later period : indeed one of the well known"], [165, "123 PRIMARY AND TRANSITION MOUNTAINS. rocks, limestone, has been deposited or formed in all the different classes of rocks except the volcanic, and must therefore receive its name from the class with which it is associated ; as primary limestone, transition limestone, &c. In some instances the mineral characters, or the fossils, serve to distinguish rocks of the same kind, that occur in the different classes or formations: thus the rocks associated with primary rocks are generally harder and more cry stalline than the same species of rock which occurs in the secondary class ; but this is not invariably the case."], [166, "124 CHAPTER VII.

Transition rocks are the principal repositories of metallic ores, which occur (both in veins and beds) more abundantly in many of the rocks of this class, than in primary rocks. Metallic veins very rarely occur in the secondary strata. Geologists have often been perplexed in their at tempts to draw a well marked line of distinction between primary and transition rocks : the difficulty has arisen chiefly from their arranging slate with the primary class; and hence the disciples of Werner"], [167, "125 CLASSIFICATION OF TRANSITION ROCKS. have been obliged to introduce the theoretical terms of newer and older primary slate, and newer and older transition slate, &c. If the occurrence of or ganic remains in rocks be the characteristic distinc tion between the primary and transition class, slate must certainly be classed with the latter; for it is among slate rocks that the fossilized remains of animals and vegetables first appear, in every country that has yet been examined. One of the disciples of Werner, M, D'Aubuisson, admits that there is no where any extensive formation of primary slate. M. Bonnard, another disciple of the same school, in his Appercu Geognostique des Terrains, after enumerating various primary slate rocks, candidly acknowledges that it is doubtful whether primary slate can any where be found. It is true, that mica slate passes by almost imperceptible gradations into common slate; but here, as in other instances, we only find that Nature is not limited by the artificial arrangements of the geologist : yet so long as it may be proper to class rocks containing organic remains, with transition rocks, we must place slate among them. Nor can this be invalidated by the fact, that in some slate rocks no vestiges of animal or vegetable remains occur; for among the secon dary strata, abounding in such remains, we often meet with alternating beds, in which they are never found ; but we do not on that account class them Avith primary rocks. In arranging transition rocks, I most decidedly place the English mountain lime stones among them, as I have done in the former editions of this work. I know no circumstance in Geology that evinces more strongly the tenacity"], [168, "126 ERRORS RESPECTING THE with which errors are cherished, when they have been sometime entertained, than the determination of English geologists to separate mountain lime- stone from transition limestone, \u2014 in opposition to analogy, and to the universal opinion of geologists on the continent. This separation, as a mere matter of classification, would be in itself of little import- ance; but it has tended more than any other circum- stance to perplex both foreign and English geolo gists, in their attempts to assimilate the rock forma tions of England, with those on the continent of Europe. When a general attention was first excited in this country to the study of Geology, access to the con tinent was extremely difficult, and we were left to explore as well as we could the geology of our own island, enlightened only by the dark-lantern of German Geognosy. Many characters were given of transition rocks, and fl\u0153tz or parallel rocks. founded on local observations in Germany, which did not apply to the rocks in other countries : it was found that the characters of our metalliferous lime stone did not agree very well with either, and there fore English geologists have retained the name of mountain limestone, and the appellation of transi tion limestone was restricted to a lower bed, small in extent, and comparatively unimportant. When I first visited the continent, and examined the cabi nets of some eminent geologists, I was particularly struck with finding the analogues of our principal beds of mountain limestone exhibited as types of true transition limestone. On my return to Paris the following year, I took specimens of our moun-"], [169, "CLASSIFICATION OF TRANSITION ROCKS. 127 tain limestone from Derbyshire, Westmoreland, Somersetshire, and Wales; and also ofthe lower limestones, from Shropshire and Devonshire, and presented them toMessrs.

Slate \u2014 of which roof-slate is a well known variety \u2014 is called by the Germans Thon scheiffer or clay slate; by ancient English geologists, argillaceous schis tus; by the modern French, Phyllade. The term slate is perhaps the most proper than can be used to designate this rock ; as the best variety of it, Roof-slate, is well known. Clay-slate is a name given from an erroneous opinion respecting its con stituent parts ; and the term is liable to create much confusion, as the softer kind of slate in the coal"], [170, "128 slate strata is called slate-clay. I shall therefore through out the present volume substitute the term slate for clay-slate, and for slate-clay the more intelligible English term shale. Slate rocks abound in most alpine districts, rest ing either on granite, gneiss, or mica-slate. That slate which lies nearest the primary rocks has a more shining lustre than the other, and partakes more of the crystalline quality of mica-slate. As this rock recedes from the primary, its texture is generally more earthy. Its colours are various shades of gray, inclining to blue, green, purple, and red. Some kinds of slate split into thin lamin\u00e6, which are well known as forming roof-slates. Slate rocks are commonly divided into beds of various degrees of thickness, which generally are much elevated, and from the natural divisions of the rock, they often form peaked and serrated mountains. Slate has been described by former geologists as distinctly stratified, because it splits easily into thin lamin\u00e6, and the direction ofthe lamin\u00e6 is asserted to be in the direction of the beds : but in opposition to the authority of many eminent geologists, I maintain that slate, unless it be of a soft or coarse kind approaching to shale or greywaeke, invariably splits in a transverse direction to that of the beds, making with that direction an angle of about sixty degrees; \u2014 it has frequently two distinct cleavages. Few persons have perhaps examined more slate rocks, or consulted more workers in slate quarries than I have; and the fact respecting its cleavage is invariably what is here stated, except in very coarse greywaeke slate, and soft slate or shale."], [171, "129 ROOF SLATE. Slate rocks vary much in quality in the same mountain; those which contain a great quantity of siliceous earth pass into flinty slate. When magne sia enters largely into the composition of slate rocks, they are distinguished by their green colour, and pass into chlorite or talcy slate. Whetstone slate, or hone, is a variety of talcy slate, containing par ticles of quartz ; when these particles are extremely minute, and the slate has a uniform consistence and requisite degree of hardness, it forms hones of the best quality. Carbonaceous matter is first disco vered in slate rocks, and increases in quantity, as they approach the secondary strata. Drawing-slate is stated to contain 1 1 per cent of carbon ; where the carbon is very abundant, the slate has a dark colour, and is generally soft. Impressions of vege tables are found in some slate rocks that were for merly regarded as primary ; the slate rocks in the vicinity of Mont Blanc, and Mont Cenis, contain impressions of ferns. That fine variety of slate which is used for roof slate, seldom forms entire mountains, but is gene rally imbedded in slate rocks ofa coarser kind: the beds of roof slate are sometimes of considerable thickness, and generally rise at an elevated angle. If geologists had not been induced, by an attach ment to theory, pertinaciously to adhere to opi nions once received, they could not have failed to re cognise the effect of crystallization in the cleavage of slate, as evidently as in the laminar divisions of felspar. Those varieties of roof-slate are preferred for the covering of buildings, which have the smoothest K"], [172, "130 FLINTY SLATE. surface and split into the thinnest plates ; they are, however, frequently made too thin to be durable, and too light to resist the force of the wind during storms. Quarries of slate are worked extensively inWest moreland, Yorkshire, Leicestershire, North Wales, Cornwall, and Devonshire. The foreign localities of slate are so numerous, it would be superfluous to name them. Mountains of slate are seldom so precipitous as those of granite ; they are covered with verdure on their declivities, as they contain less silex and a more equal admixture of the earths favourable to vegetation. Flinty slate, as before observed, differs from common slate by containing a greater quantity of siliceous earth ; and, as its name implies, it partakes ofthe nature of flint. Slate and flinty slate not only pass into each other, but frequently alternate. When the latter ceases to have the slaty structure, it becomes hornstone, or what the French deno minate petro-silex. If it contain crystals of felspar, it becomes hornstone porphyry : all these varieties may be observed alternating with each other in the same rocks in Charnwood Forest, and in North Wales and Cumberland. Slate is regarded as one of the most metalliferous rocks : nearly all the principal metallic ores have been found in slate, either in veins or beds ; but it is remarkable that flinty slate seldom contains any repositories of metallic matter. Lead and copper are the principal metals found in the slate rocks of England and Wales ; they are not so rich in lead as"], [173, "GREYWACKE. 131 the mountain limestone, but the lead ore in slate rocks contains a larger portion of silver. Greywaeke and Greywaeke Slate ; German Grau wacke. \u2014 This dissonant term, which we have borrowed from the German, the French geologists have exchanged for a name not more harmonious, though more expressive, Traumate, from the Greek Thrausma a fragment. Greywaeke in its most common form may be described as a coarse slate containing particles or fragments of other rocks or minerals, varying in size from two or more inches, to the smallest grain that can be perceived by the eye. When the im bedded particles become extremely minute, grey waeke passes into slate. When the particles and fragments are numerous, and the slate in which they are cemented can scarcely be perceived, grey waeke becomes coarse sandstone or gritstone. When the fragments are larger and angular, grey waeke might be described as a breccia with a paste of slate. When the fragments are rounded, it might not improperly be called an ancient puddingstone. When rocks of greywaeke have a slaty structure, they form greywaeke slate. Greywaeke has by some of the French geolo gists been described as a transition sandstone, with a cement either of siliceous earth, or of slate. This definition agrees with the gritstones associated with the upper transition or mountain limestone. Where the paste is hard and siliceous, as I have observed in the greywaeke of Savoy that separates the primary from the secondary rocks, many of the siliceous particles may have been original conre- k2"], [174, "132 OLD RED SANDSTONE IS tions, formed at the same time as the paste ; and where these concretions are all composed of quartz, we may infer that such has been their mode of formation. In other instances, the fragments are evidently the debris of more ancient rocks, that have been broken down by some great catastrophe, and mixed with more recent beds at the period when they were forming. This mode of formation implies, that a considerable period elapsed between the formation of the primary and secondary rocks. The fragments are always those of lower rocks, and never ofthe upper strata. In some situations im mense beds of loose conglomerate, composed of large fragments and boulders of the lower rocks, separate the slate rocks from the calcareous forma tions : such conglomerates may be regarded as oc cupying the geological place of greywaeke, and belonging to the greywaeke formation. The old red sandstone, about which so much has been written and so little understood, is a grey waeke coloured red by the accidental admixture of oxide of iron. In Monmouthshire, the relations of red sandstone with greywaeke, and the passage of one rock into the other, may be distinctly observed ; the connection also with the lower gritstone, under the mountain limestone, may be plainly traced. Here then we have the mountain limestone with its alternating beds of grit, the red sandstone and the greywaeke, evidently members of the same forma tion ; and to make the connection more complete, the red sandstone contains beds of limestone, which form the link between the lower transition, and the upper transition limestones. This limestone is im-"], [175, "133 A MODE OF GREYWACKE. perfect, being intermixed with siliceous particles; it is ofa greenish colour, and hence called Gooseberry limestone. The red sandstone also passes into clay stone, as well characterized as that of the Pent land Hills*. The old red sandstone possesses all the mineral characters of greywaeke except the colour, which is a quality that can never be considered of impor tance, being chiefly derived from local or accidental causes. The old red sandstone also occupies the geological position of greywaeke, and greywaeke slate, into which it passes merely by a change of colour. The principal reason why it has not been generally recognised as belonging to the grey waeke formation is, that it has frequently been con founded with the red sandstone above the coal for mation : they greatly resemble each other, and it is not yet clearly ascertained, whether the red sand stone in some parts of England be the old red sand stone or the new. Until English geologists shall renounce their prejudices, and place the old red sandstone and mountain limestone in the Transi tion Class, as greywaeke, and transition limestone, every attempt will be vain to identify this part of the geology of England with that of the Continent : particularly as the Alpine limestone of foreign geo logists, is a very different formation to the transition * From the quantity of oxide of iron and of red marie in some beds of the old red sandstone, and from its passage into clay stone, I am inclined to believe that the red sandstone of Mon mouthshire has partly been formed by the decomposition of an ancient basaltic formation, which has become intermixed with greywaeke."], [176, "134 SINGULAR CONTORTIONS OF limestone, comprising the several formations of limestone above the coal strata, and new red sand stone, or what the French call Gre~s bigarre. Transition limestone. \u2014 This is one of the most important of the transition rocks : its mineral charac ters vary considerably, according to the nature of the rocks with which it is associated ; it has gene rally a subcrystalline texture, and is more or less translucent on the edges. From the degree of hard ness which it possesses, it will take a good polish : most of the coloured marbles are transition lime stone. The prevailing colour is blueish gray, but it is sometimes red, brown, or black ; the lower beds of this limestone are often beautifully variegated, veined, and spotted. It may be stated generally, that transition limestones are seldom so perfectly crystal line as primary limestones, and they have rarely the compact and earthy texture of secondary limestones. Transition limestoneoccursinbedsalternatingwith slate, greywaeke, greywaeke slate, and coarse grit stone. Some of these beds are of considerable thick ness, and form mountain masses. The lowest beds al ternate with slate; they contain few organic remains. The variegated limestone of Devonshire is of this kind. Sometimes numerous thin strata of slate and transition limestone alternate, and are much bent and contorted. A very remarkable instance of this occurs at Drewsteignton near Moreton in Devon shire, where a series of thin strata of dark lime stone, alternate with strata of indurated slate, and are bent and folded in various directions. Were we to take a number of alternating sheets of black and brown paper, and fold them nearly round a wine"], [177, "135 TRANSITION LIMESTONE. decanter, and then bend them back over the lower folds, we should have a not unapt representation of the singular contortions of the strata in this place, where they are exposed to view by extensive quar ries cut in the rock. The remarkable contortions of the beds of trans ition limestone and slate, imply the operation of a cause that could not only bend but soften the strata ; and were we to admit that granite has once been in a state of fusion, and been protruded through the outer crust of the globe, the immediate contiguity of these bended strata to the granite of Dartmoor might indicate the agent by which the effects were produced. Near Dudley, in Staffordshire, we have another remarkable instance of the bending of beds of transition limestone ; but this is in the vicinity of basaltic rocks, which are now admitted to be of igneous origin. The limestone at Wren's Nest, near Dudley, con sists of two beds, one ten, and the other fourteen yards thick, resting upon beds of soft and imperfect limestone and shale, called wild measures. The two beds of limestone are separated by similar strata of wild measures thirty-eight yards in thick ness, and are raised up together in a position ap proaching to vertical, and are folded round the hill inclosing a space of about fifty acres, with a double wall of limestone rising above the country, like an oval tower widening at the lower part. If two sheets of pasteboard were separated by a quire of writing-paper and laid flat, and a blunt metallic rod were thrust through the whole from beneath, it would force the lower sheet of paste-"], [178, "136 LOWER TRANSITION LIMESTONE. board through the upper sheets, and represent the present position of the strata at Wren's Nest Hill. At Dudley Castle Hill, about a mile distant, the beds of limestone are bent, and dip on each side of the hill. (See a section of this Hill, Plate 3. fig. 4.) The transition limestone of Dudley is not covered by any beds of the upper transition or mountain limestone, but by strata about seventy-six yards in total thickness, composed of imperfect limestone and sandstone, which separate it from the lowest coal measures. It is therefore to be particularly noticed, that the coal strata which in most of the coal districts in England rest upon the upper trans ition or mountain limestone, in this part of Stafford shire rest upon the lower transition limestone. The remarkable fossil the trilobite, called the Dudley fossil, occurs principally if not entirely in a stratum under the first limestone. There are shells in what are called the wild measures, but they are in a soft and decomposing state. The lower transition limestone in England and Wales is not a very extensive formation : it skirts the granite of Dartmoor, and part of the Malvern Hills ; it extends in a narrow belt fromWenlock in Shropshire, to Caermarthen in Wales, and is ge nerally accompanied with soft greenish schistose strata, called provincially Dye Earth, which contain numerous impressions of shells. A few patches of this limestone occur in various parts of the slate districts in Wales and Cumberland. This part of the transition limestone series, is chiefly remarkable for its organic remains ; it is rarely metalliferous. The upper transition or mountain limestone is,"], [179, "UPPER TRANSITION OR MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE. 137 as I have before stated, the limestone to which the French geologists gave, par excellence, the name of Calcaire de transition. It is by many English geologists considered as a distinct formation from the lower, or what they call the true transition lime stone; and it is said to be \"separated from it by the important formation of the old red sandstone :\" but the latter is only a variety of greywaeke, and is acknowledged even by those who make it a dis tinct formation, to graduate into greywaeke, and possess all the general characters of that rock, ex cept-that it is coloured red. It contains in some situations beds of imperfect limestone, which may be said to connect the lower transition and moun tain limestones in one formation, together with the associated beds of greywaeke, red sandstone, and gritstone. Mountain limestone is one of the most important calcareous rocks in England and Wales, both from its extent, the thickness and number of its beds, the quantity and variety of its organic remains, and its richness in metallic ores, particularly of lead. In Derbyshire, where the different beds of limestone have been pierced through by the miners, the ave rage thickness ofthe three uppermost is about 160 yards ; the beds are separated by beds of trap or basalt, resembling ancient lavas. The fourth or lowest limestone has not been pierced through. The three beds of limestone are distinctly stratified ; the prevailing colour is gray : some of the strata in the upper limestone bed, seem almost entirely com posed of the fossil remains of encrinites. In the northern part of Yorkshire, and in Westmoreland"], [180, "138 MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE. and Cumberland, the beds of mountain limestone alternate with beds of greywaeke slate, and coarse sandstone. In North Wales, and in Somersetshire, mountain limestone forms entire mountain masses of vast thickness, distinctly stratified; the strata often varying in colour, and sometimes in the nature of their organic remains. The beds of mountain limestone vary very much in different parts of England in their number and thickness ; even the quality of the limestone of the same stratum sometimes varies much in the same mountain. At Llanymynah, a low mountain com posed of this limestone, the quality ofthe limestone on one side of the hill is considered by the lime burners ofthe very best kind; while at a little di stance the same strata are so impure, from an in termixture with sand and clay, that they cannot be used with advantage : but what is more remarkable, I have seen in this hill, a stratum ofthe best lime stone, lying regularly between other strata, sud denly terminate, and a whitish calcareous marie occupy its place, and preserving the same degree of thickness, and the same direction. As these strata contain marine organic remains, and were deposited at the bottom of the ocean, we may sup pose that a submarine current had prevented the limestone from extending further, and supplied its place by a deposition of clay, before the stratum above was deposited. In the former case, where the strata of good limestone become in some parts calcareous and impure, we may suppose that sub marine currents carrying away particles of sand, had intermixed them with the calcareous depositions"], [181, "139 CAVERNS. in one part, but not in another. Indeed this sud den change in the quality of the limestone, is so common in that part of Wales, that the workmen have given to it the expressive name of Balk stone. When I was first informed of the balk stone, and saw that it impeded the operations of the quarry men, I expected to have found a dyke of basalt, and was surprised to observe a mass of stratified lime stone of an impure quality, cutting through the best limestone like a thick wall, and left standing, the good limestone being worked away on each side of it. This wall of limestone was of a darker colour than the rest ; it contained the remains of encrinites. It is owing, I conceive, to irregula rities in the deposition of the strata, from causes attending their original formation, that soft and irregular beds or masses of clay occur in mountain limestone, which have probably been washed out by subterranean currents of water, and formed ex cavations and caverns of considerable magnitude. Many instances might be cited of considerable streams, and even rivers, ingulphed in mountain limestone, and rising again at the distance of several miles. In the northern counties these openings are called Swallow Holes. Mr. Farey has enume rated twenty-eight swallow holes, in the mountain limestone of Derbyshire. It is in the lower beds of mountain limestone that enormous natural caverns frequently occur; such are the well-known cavern near Castleton, and Pools-hole near Buxton in Derbyshire, and Yordas cave under Whernside in Craven. Gordal Scar and Weathercote Cave in the same district, cannot pro-"], [182, "140 CAVERNS. perly be called caverns, as they are open to the day ; but the latter was probably once a cavern, of which the roof has fallen in. In all these caverns, and others that I have observed in this limestone, there is a stream of running water, which is more or less copious in rainy or dry seasons; and I am inclined to believe that the caverns have been formed by the agency of water percolating through natural fissures, and in the lapse of ages excavating the softer or more broken parts of the rock. The prodigious force with which these subterranean streams rush through the openings of some of these caverns, after continued rains, suggests the probability of this mode of formation. The whole of that enor- mous mass of limestone in Craven, from Ingle- borough and Whernside to Gordal, is intersected by perpendicular fissures, which are narrow at the top, and become wider as they descend, through which the water may be heard to run at a vast depth be- low. These unseen but ever-active streams are slowly but progressively wearing down the internal parts of these calcareous mountains, and depositing them in the sea. The limestone of Derbyshire contains thick beds of trap or basalt. In one or two instances the Der byshire trap has been observed to assume the co lumnar structure. Other beds contain cavities filled with calcareous spar : they are provincially called Toadstone, the amygdaloid of mineralogists. Some varieties have a near resemblance to lava, and were supposed by Mr. Whitehurst to have been forced between the beds of limestone when in a state of fusion. Were we to admit their igneous origin, a"], [183, "141 QUARTZ ROCK. more natural supposition, I conceive would be, that they were formed at distant periods of time, by suc cessive eruptions of submarine volcanoes, when these mountains were covered by the ocean ; for it cannot be doubted that they were once under the sea. From recent observations, we have reason to believe that the agency of submarine volcanoes is very extensive. Probably many of the differences observed in volcanic products and basaltic rocks, were occasioned by the different circumstances to which they were exposed after their eruption, on dry land, or under the incumbent pressure of the waters of the ocean. The upper transition or mountain limestone in En gland is particularly metalliferous; the principal ores are those of lead and zinc; they occur principally in veins. Nearly all the lead obtained from the English mines is found in the mountain limestone. Ores of copper occur in small quantities in this limestone. Most of the fossil organic remains, both in the upper and lower transition rocks, are of genera that are not found in the secondary limestones. Some of the upper beds seem almost entirely composed of encrinites : madrepores and corallites occur abun dantly in the middle part of this formation. Quartz Rock. \u2014 Rocks composed entirely of cry stalline grains of quartz, sometimes occur among primary and transition mountains. Certain causes appear to have operated locally, and separated the quartz and felspar of granite into masses of consider able size. The quartz rock in the county of Wicklow I observed to be formed of what is called greasy quartz, similar to that in numerous veins in the mica-"], [184, "142 JASPER. slate, near its junction with granite in the adjacent mountains, and is probably cotemporaneous with the veins. According to Dr. MacCulloch, the quartz rock in many parts of the Highlands present evi dent indications of being composed of fragments and rounded pieces again united, and is in fact a quartzose greywaeke or grit. Part of the Lickey Hill near Bromsgrove is composed of granular quartz ; and similar beds occur near the village of Hartshill, in Warwickshire, between Atherstone and Nuneaton. Quartz rock, as distinguished from quartzose gritstone, is an inconsiderable formation, and may with more propriety be referred to the Transition, than the Primary Class. Jasper. \u2014 This mineral is of rare occurrence as a constituent part of beds, or of mountain masses ; it differs little from a siliceous flinty slate, but is gene rally coloured red, brown, or yellow, and is opaque. It contains a large portion of the oxide of iron in its composition. The beds of shale in the coal strata are sometimes converted by fire into a substance in every respect resembling jasper. There are beds of jasper of considerable magnitude in some parts of the Apennines covered by rocks of serpentine. In some situations beds of slaty jasper alternate with slate, to which rock they appear to bear the same relation as flinty slate. Lydian stone, which is a black siliceous flint slate, is by some geologists called black Jasper. The only bed of jasper that I have seen among the English rocks, occurs asso ciated with beds of manganese ore at Doddiscomb leigh in Devonshire. Jasper sometimes occurs in veins, and forms nodules in basaltic rocks."], [185, "HORNBLENDE ROCK. 143 Hornblende rock and Greenstone. \u2014 Hornblende rock has been described as associated with primary rocks, it also occurs in the lower transition rocks. Transition hornblende presents no variety of cha racter by which it can be distinguished from Primary. Greenstone composed of felspar and hornblende, in which the felspar is white, and sienitic greenstone, in which the felspar is red, sometimes occur in beds among transition rocks, particularly of slate. But more frequently rocks of greenstone, sometimes called Trap, occur in an unconformable position, covering rocks both of the transition and secondary class, and will be described in the chapter on Un conformable Rocks ; after the description of the lower secondary strata containing coal. Observations on ConformableTransition Rocks. The order of succession in conformable transition rocks is ex tremely variable, and the thickness of the same beds differs greatly in different situations. In one district we find a whole uninter rupted series of calcareous strata, forming entire mountains; and in an adjacent district the same series are widely separated by intervening beds of slate, greywaeke, or sandstone ; and many of the strata which occur in one place, will often be wanting in another. We have before observed, that calcareous transition strata are subject to sudden variations of quality in the same mountain : we cannot therefore be surprised, that in distant dis tricts a great diversity should exist, both in the number and thickness of calcareous strata of the same formation ; no single stratum can be regarded as an universal formation. In whatever manner the strata were deposited, the deposition has been inter rupted by causes to us unknown, which have accumulated thick masses in one situation, and prevented their formation in other parts. With respect to beds composed chiefly of the fragments of older rocks, it is evident that the contiguity to rocks which"], [186, "144 OBSERVATIONS. were most easily disintegrated, would produce thicker beds of fragments in certain situations than in others, and that their formation must be local. The organic remains found in transition rocks, belong almost exclusively to genera no longer existing, and which do not occur in the upper secondary strata. Vegetable remains are rare in transition rocks; they occur sometimes in slate rocks. The trilobite is peculiar to transition rocks ; the gigantic species occurs in slate, and the smaller species in limestone. Thc ortho ceratite is chiefly found in transition limestone ; univalve shells rarely occur in it. The prevailing fossils in this class are madre pores, corallites, and encrinites. The remains of vertebrated animals are rarely, if ever, found in transition rocks. Many in stances cited by foreign geologists of vertebrated animals found in this class of rocks are erroneous ; the rocks in which they occur belong to the secondary strata. And its hould be known, that some English conchologists have described fossil remains from specimens collected in particular counties, without knowing pre cisely their true localities, or whether they were found in situ or in diluvial deposits. In the near vicinity of the transition limestone in Derbyshire, I have collected gryphites and numu lites, and even the fossils of the chalk formation, but they had no relation to the ancient limestone ; they were found in beds of gravel. Conformable transition rocks cover the primary, and sometimes alternate with them ; they are also associated with the lowest beds of the coal formation, so that no well marked division can be traced between them : but there is one character, independent of all artificial arrangements, which serves to distinguish transi tion rocks from the upper secondary strata, in countries where the regular coal formation is found. All rocks under the coal form ation belong either to the transition or primary class ; and all the strata above the coal formation, belong either to the upper se condary or the tertiary class. The geological position of the regu lar coal formation thus serves as a simple and intelligible key to the geology of all countries where the coal formation occurs. But where the coal strata are absent, the difficulty of determining the class to which certain rock formations belong, is often very great. Of this we have a striking instance in the perplexed attempts of foreign geologists to classify the vast calcareous formations ofthe"], [187, "OBSERVATIONS. 145 Jura, and the outer range of the Alps ;and the perplexity is further increased, hythe mistakes which are made in referring to the En glish mountain limestone, by confounding it with the calcaire alpin or alpine limestone. The alpine limestone, according to some geo logists, is a transition limestone ; but according toother geologists, it is analogous to the magnesian limestone under the new red sandstone, and also comprises the lias limestones and the oolites. Indeed, I am convinced that in the vicinity of the Alps, rocks analogous to the chalk formation, have not unfrequently been classed with transition limestones. These mistakes have arisen from a desire to make observations agree with preconceived theories, and the artificial arrangements which Werner had in vented. Thus it was taken for granted, that the granitic moun tains of the Alps being primary, the calcareous mountains must be primary also ; and when organic remains were first discovered in them, the geologists in France were greatly surprised, and seemed unwilling to admit the fact : at length, by a painful and reluctant effort, they removed all these mountains from the primary to the transition class. A more Herculean labour remains to be per formed, \u2014 that of removing many of these mountains still higher, into the upper secondary class. In the vicinity of Moutiers in the Tarentaise, where M. Brochant first observed some organic remains supposed to belong to transition rocks, I discovered the Patella and other fossils, peculiar to the upper secondary strata. In parts of France at a distance from the Alps and the Jura, the mineral character of the secondary strata might alone serve to identify them with the English lias, oolites, and chalk ; but in the range of the Jura and the outer ranges of the Alps, the calcareous formations are of such immense magnitude, and the beds are often so highly indurated and crystalline, that it is only from their relative position and imbedded fossils that we can trace their analogy to the English strata, or to the secondary strata in the north of France.

IT has been stated in the preceding chapter, that the upper conformable transition rocks are fre quently associated with the lower series of secondary strata; so that from their position and mineral cha racters alone, no well marked line of division could be drawn between them : there is however a truly remarkable difference in the nature of the organic remains in the transition rocks, and in the lower secondary strata. In the transition series, the or ganic remains are almost exclusively those of marine animals, which are believed to have lived in the deepest parts of the ocean. In the lower secondary"], [189, "147 COAL strata covering the transition rocks, the organic remains belong almost exclusively to the vegetable kingdom, and are analogous to the native plants of warm or tropical climates. These strata also con tain much carbonaceous and bituminous matter, and frequently alternate with regular beds of coal. The striking change in the nature of these or ganic remains, from marine animals to vegetables, marks that a great revolution had taken place in the condition of our present continents, after the forma tion of the mountain limestone, and before the de position of the coal strata. To whatever causes we are to attribute this change, it has also been attended with another effect not less remarkable : after this period the formation of metallic veins appears to have almost entirely ceased, for they very rarely shoot up into the secondary strata which alternate with the principal beds of coal. We have a remarkable instance of this change from animal to vegetable remains in the prevailing rocks of some ofthe northern counties. The moun tains of transition limestone which extend through the Peak of Derbyshire, and through Craven in Yorkshire, abound exclusively with the organic remains of marine animals. They are covered on the eastern side by two thick beds, which contain carbonaceous and bituminous matter and vegetable impressions. The lowest is from one hundred and fifty, to one hundred and seventy yards in thickness. It is called by Mr. Farey* Limestone shale, because it occurs over limestone. It is composed principally * Farey's Derbyshire. l2"], [190, "148 BROWN COAL OR WOOD COAL. of thin strata of shale and sandstone. Where it is exposed to the air, it is of a dark reddish-brown co lour ; over this lies a bed of coarse-grained siliceous sandstone, not less than one hundred and thirty yards in thickness. It has been called Millstone grit by Mr. Whitehurst and the miners in the north of England, from being used for the purposes of millstones. These two beds separate the metalli ferous limestone from the coal strata in that part of England ; for, though thin seams of coal sometimes are met with in them, they do not contain any of sufficient thickness to be worked. In the counties of Northumberland and Durham, the separation between the strata containing animal remains, and those which contain exclusively vegetable remains, is not so distinctly marked. In the lower part of the great series of strata of micaceous sandstone, shale, gritstone, and coal, which together comprise the coal formation of those districts, there are some beds of limestone, and a few seams of imperfect coal under the limestone ; but the upper part of this series, to the depth of nearly one thousand feet, con tains organic remains belonging almost exclusively to the vegetable kingdom. Coal is a mineral too well known to require a particular description. Mineralogists divide coal into two species, \u2014 Brown coal, and Black coal; the former, sometimes called wood coal, is chiefly found in diluvial or in alluvial ground. It contains, besides charcoal and bitumen, various vegetable principles, and the branches or trunks of trees partially decomposed, which mark the origin of this kind of coal."], [191, "149 BLACK COAL. Black coal, or common coal, is composed of char coal, bitumen, and earthy matter. The latter forms the ashes which remain after combustion : these vary in proportion in different coals, from two to near twenty per cent. The proportion of bitu men varies from twenty to forty per cent, and the charcoal from forty to more than eighty per cent. Mineralogists have enumerated many different. kinds of black coal : several of these pass by gra dation into each other in the same mine. The most important varieties in an ceconomical view are the hard coal, like that of Staffordshire, and bituminous or caking coal, called in London Sea coal. Black, or common coal, occurs in regular strata, which vary in thickness from a few inches to several feet or even yards. Many strata of coal often oc cur under each other, separated by strata of indu rated clay, micaceous sandstone, coarse gritstone, ironstone, and soft bituminous slate calledshale, and loose stones and clay called rubble. The se ries of strata which occur in one situation is de nominated a coal-field. Every district has its peculiar series of strata un connected with any other : hence, the series of stra tified coal have been denominated independent coal formations. Coal-fields are of limited extent, and the strata frequently dip to a common centre, being often arranged in basin-shaped concavities, which appear to have been originally detached lakes, that were gradually filled by repeated depositions of carbona ceous and mineral matter. In some of the larger coal-fields, the original form of the lake cannot be"], [192, "150 COAL-FIELDS. traced, but in the smaller ones it is distinctly pre served. The different strata under a bed of coal are fre quently similar to the strata over it; and the same series is again repeated under the lower beds ot coal, and sometimes with a perfect similarity both in the succession and thickness of each. In some instances a single bed of stone of vast thickness, separates two beds of coal, ln other instances, only a very thin stratum of shale or clay lies between coal beds. Though numerous beds or seams of coal occur in one coal-field, very rarely more than three of these are worked. The thickness of the coal strata in the same coal-field often varies from a few inches to se veral yards ; but each stratum generally preserves the same thickness throughout its whole extent. In stances to the contrary sometimes occur, in which the same bed will become narrower or wider, and sometimes be divided by a stratum of incombustible earthy matter, in different parts of its course. Few beds of coal are worked at a great depth which are less than two feet in thickness. The stratum lying over a bed of coal is called the roof, and the stra tum under it the floor. The facility of getting coal depends very much on the compactness of the stone which forms the roof, not only on account of the security from falling, but for keeping out the upper water and preserving the pit in a dry state. The great expense incurred in supporting the roof when it is loose, frequently prevents a valuable bed of coal from being worked, or absorbs all the profit.

When this falls down, and is intermixt with water and small coal at the bottom, it takes fire spontaneously ; on which account the miners close up the space with common clay, where the coal has been worked, to prevent the access of air to the combustible matter. This kind of combustible clay is called tow ; it is common in the Ashby-de-la-Zouch coal-field, and in Staffordshire. \u2014 The floor or stratum on which the coal lies, consists of clay in various degrees of induration, and is almost always of that kind which will resist the action of fire, called fire-clay, suited for furnace bricks and crucibles. (See Mr. Farey's Derbyshire, p. 179.) It has been before observed that coal strata are frequently bent in concavities, resembling a trough or basin, dipping down on one side of the field and rising on the other. In plate 3. fig. 2. the section of a coal-field is represented, in which the coal strata c c d d are inclined in this manner, but partially dislocated by a fracture or fault aty. The extremities of the lowest stratum c c are several miles distant in some coal-fields, in others not more than one mile. In the great coal-field or basin in South Wales, the strata are arranged in this manner over an ex tent of nearly a hundred miles in length, and a variable breadth of from five, to twenty miles. It is partly broken into by Caermarthen Bay, but it forms an extent of surface exceeding twelve hundred square miles. It contains twenty-three beds of workable coal, which are said by Mr. Martin to make together ninety-five feet in thickness of this"], [194, "152 FAULTS AND DYKES. valuable mineral ; this will yield sixty-four million tons of coal per square mile. The thickest bed of coal is nine feet ; in some parts there are sixteen seams of ironstone. The strata of this vast coal field are deeply cut through by valleys, and are much broken by faults, and the quality of the coal varies greatly in different parts ofthe field. At the Clee Hills in Shropshire, the breadth of some of the coal-fields is not a mile. At Ashby Wolds in Leicestershire, in the central part ofthe field at e, Plate 3. fig. 2. the main bed of coal is worked at the depth of two hundred and forty yards ; but by the bending and rise ofthe strata, the same bed comes to the surface at c, about three miles distant. The depth of coal strata is very different in different situations, and, from the inclination or bending ofthe strata, differs much in the same dis trict, as will be evident from what has been stated, and from an inspection ofthe last-mentioned figure. Some coal-fields extend in a waving form over a district. On the eastern side of England, the strata gene rally decline, or, in the miner's language, dip to the south-east point: on the western side, the strata are more frequently thrown into different and oppo site directions, by what are called faults and dykes. A Fault is a break or intersection of a series of strata, on one side of which they are raised or thrown down; so that in working a bed of coal, the men come suddenly to its apparent termination. A Dyke is a wall of mineral matter, cutting through the strata in a position nearly vertical. The name dyke is originally derived from our Northern neigh-"], [195, "153 FAULTS AND DYKES. bours ; it signifies a wall. The thickness of dykes varies from a few inches, to twenty or thirty feet, and even yards. The dykes which intersect coal strata are composed of indurated clay, or more fre quently of basalt, and will be particularly described in the following chapter. In some coal-fields the strata are raised or thrown down on one side of a dyke one hundred and fifty yards or more; and the miner after penetrating through it, (see Plate 3. fig. 3,) instead of finding the same coal again, meets with beds of stone or clay on the other side at e: hence he is frequently at a loss how to proceed in searching for the coal which is thus cut off. If the stratum of stone e be the same as any of the strata which were sunk through in making the pit or shaft g g, it proves that the bed of coal is thrown down on the side ofthe fault at e, and he can determine the exact distance between that stratum, and the coal he is in search of. But if the stone is ofa different kind to any which was above the coal c c, he may be certain that the strata are raised on that side; but to what distance can only be ascertained by trial, if the under strata of the coal bed c c have not been previously perforated. It frequently hap pens, however, that two or more strata of stone or shale at different depths, are so similar in their qua lity and appearance, that it is impossible to distin guish them : in such cases it is necessary to perfo rate the stratum, to ascertain its thickness and exa mine the quality of the strata above or below it, by which its identity with any known stratum may generally be ascertained. The manner in which the strata are inclined towards the fault, will also"], [196, "154 FAULTS AND DYKES. determine whether they are thrown up or down, provided they are not shattered where they come in contact with it, which is frequently the case*. Each bed of coal in a coal-field has certain charac ters by which it may generally be known to be the same. Its thickness, and the quality of the roof and floor, with that of the upper and under strata, generally serve to identify it, though it may sink deeper in one place than another, and vary in di stance from the surface five hundred feet. The dykes which intersect coal strata are gene rally impervious to water; and it not unfrequently happens, that where the strata decline to them, they hold up the water and occasion springs at the sur face, or keep the coal-works on that side of the fault underwater, when the coal-works on the other side are dry. This will be better understood by referring to plate 3. fig. 2 and 3, where the coal strata on the right hand of the faults decline or dip to them ; and the water which passes through or between the strata will be stopped at the faults and held up, should any of the lower strata be also im pervious, in which case the coal beds to the right of the fault will be under water, and those on the other side dry. Now should a perforation be in cautiously made through the dyke, all the water will be thrown upon the works on the left, that were before dry. Where the wall on each side of a fault * If the dyke make an acute angle with the upper surface of the strata, they are thrown up on that side ; but if it make an obtuse angle, they are thrown down. See Plate 3. fig. 2. r>; and fig, 3. </."], [197, "COAL MINES. 155 belongs to different proprietors, a few strokes with a pickaxe may thus do incalculable mischief to those on the one side, and render great service to the other, by laying their pits dry. The deepest coal mines in England are those in Northumberland and in the county of Durham, some of which are worked nearly three hundred yards below the surface. The thickest bed of English coal of any considerable extent is the main coal in Staffordshire, which is thirty feet. The upper, lower, and middle parts of the bed differ in quality. Mr. Keir, who has written an interesting account of the mineralogy of the south of Stafford shire, says that thirteen different kinds of coal occur over each other in this bed ; the uppermost, which is compact, serves as a roof in getting the under coal. At the Wood Mill-hill colliery in this county, the coal is said to be forty-five feet thick ; and three beds of coal, from three to four feet in thickness, have been found under it, since Mr. Keir's account was published. The first is only two yards under the thick coal. The main bed of coal in the Ashby de-la-Zouch coal-field is thirteen feet thick; the upper and lower seams of this bed also vary in quality; and the top serves as the roof, being more compact than the stratum over the coal. Few beds of coal in other parts of England or in Wales ex ceed from six to nine feet in thickness ; but a dif ference in the quality may generally be observed in the upper, lower, and middle parts of the same bed. A curious fact is stated by Mr. Keir respecting the main coal of Staffordshire: \u2014 In one situa-"], [198, "156 FAULTY GROUND. tion the upper part of the bed separates from the lower, and rises to the surface, or crops out. It is at first divided by indurated clay called bind or clunch ; but as the distance becomes wider, the in tervening stone grows harder, and will strike sire with flint. Similar separations take place some times in the beds of coal in the mines of Northum berland and Durham. The largest known bed of coal in the west riding of Yorkshire is near Barnsley : it is ten feet thick, and is supposed to be formed by the meeting of two or more seams, which soon separate again. The miners have not been able to trace the same bed in situations where it might have been found, had it preserved the same thickness in other parts of its course. Coal strata, beside the more common dislocations by faults, present remarkable contortions which it would be difficult to explain, except by admitting a lateral force, which has compressed them into a zig zag form. To the same cause, or perhaps to a partial sinking of the earth, we may attribute the origin of what is called faulty ground, which fre quently occurs in coal-fields. In this, no actual dyke appears to have been formed ; but the beds of coal with all the accompanying strata are so broken and shattered, that no workings can be carried on, till the miner has got through them into regular strata. These broken parts of the strata, called troubles and faulty ground, occasion much more difficulty to the miner than common faults or dykes, and are sometimes of great extent. In some coal-fields one part of a stratum is in clined, and the other part vertical. A curious fact"], [199, "157 POSITION OF THE STRATA EXPLAINED. of this kind may be seen in a small coal-field near the town of Manchester*. The position of coal strata in many coal-fields may be represented by a series of freshwater mus cle shells, decreasing in size, laid within each other, but separated by a thin paste of clay. If one side of the shell be raised, it will represent the ge neral rise of the strata in that direction ; and if the whole series be dislocated by partial cracks, raising one part a little and depressing the other, to re present faults in the coal, it will give a better idea of the coal-field than any description can convey. We are here to suppose that each shell represents a stratum of coal, and the partitions of clay the earthy strata by which they are separated. The outer shell represents the lowest bed of coal, which may be many miles in extent Now if a much larger shell be filled with sand, and the lowest shell be pressed into it, we may consider the large shell to represent limestone, and the sand gritstone; we shall then have a model of the coal strata in many parts of England, and their situation over the me talliferous lime, with the beds of sandstone by which they are separated from it. From the inclination or bending of coal strata, they always rise near to the surface in some parts of their course, and would be visible if not covered by soil or gravel. In the intersections formed by rivulets, or by accidental fractures on the sides of hills in a district, the nature of the strata may often * I have given a short account of this coal-field in the second volume ofthe Transactions of the Geological Society."], [200, "158 ON SEARCHING FOR COAL. be determined, and should be ascertained before any expense be incurred in boring or sinking for coal. When this is done, a proper station should be chosen; which requires great judgement: other wise it is possible to bore or sink to great depths, and miss a bed of coal which exists very near the place: this will be evident from the inspection of the two stations, a and b, Plate 3. fig. 2 : in the latter it would be impossible to meet w ith the bed of coal, c, because the search is made beyond the line where it rises to the surface, or, in the miner's language, crops out. At a, coal would be found after sinking only a few yards. In most situations it is better to search for coal, as deep as can be done without expensive machinery, by sinking a well in preference to boring. By sinking, a deci sive knowledge of the nature and thickness of the strata can be ascertained as far as you descend, which can only be imperfectly known by boring ; for the latter mode is liable to great uncertainty of result, from bendings or slips of the strata. If, for instance, the borer be worked in the situation a, Plate 3. fig. 2. it will pass through a great depth of coal, which in reality may not be more than a few inches in thickness. Besides the uncertainty of the results, the grossest impositions are sometimes practised to answer interested purposes, and induce proprietors to continue the search, where there is no reasonable probability of success. Where coal strata come to the surface, they are generally in a soft decomposed state, and intermixt with earthy matter. They frequently present no appearance of coal, but the soil may be observed of a darker"], [201, "159 IRONSTONE. colour. The real quality of the coal cannot be as certained until it is found below in its natural un decomposed state, lying between two regular strata of stone, or indurated clay. In general it is ob served that the same bed improves in quality, as it sinks deeper into the earth. Coal strata are generally split or divisible into rhomboidal blocks, by vertical joints, which range about E.S.E. and W.N.W. : these are called slines ; the oblique shorter joints are called cutters. From what will be stated in the subsequent chapters, it will appear that there is more than one third of England in which all search for valuable coal is useless : the knowledge of a negative fact becomes important, when it saves us from loss of time, expense, and disappointment. Coal strata are frequently accompanied by thin strata of ironstone. This stone has a dark-brown or gray colour, and has an earthy appearance and fracture, and is about three times heavier than an equal bulk of water. Some kinds have the specific gravity of 3-6. Though modern mineralogists call this mineral clay-ironstone after Werner, from its resemblance to argillaceous stones, \u2014 on analysis it is found to contain but a very minute portion of alu mine or pure clay, sometimes not more than two per cent. It is principally composed of iron com bined with oxygen, carbonic acid, and water, and a small quantity of silex, and in some instances with calcareous earth. If it be of a good quality, it yields more than thirty per cent of iron. In some of the beds of clay over coal, detached nodules of iron stone occur, which are also smelted for iron."], [202, "160 IRONSTONE. The vast extent and importance of our iron-works are well known, but their establishment is of recent date. Formerly our furnaces were on a diminutive scale, and wood or charcoal was the only fuel em ployed ; but in the present cultivated state of the country, wood could not be procured in requisite quantity. The application of coal or coke to the smelting of iron is among the most useful of mo dern improvements ; but it is only some kinds of coal that are proper for the purpose. Inattention to this circumstance has frequently led landed pro prietors to great unprofitable expense. Finding ironstone and coal in abundance upon their estates, they have constructed furnaces and other works at a considerable cost, and have discovered too late that the coal, however suitable for domestic or other uses, was unfit to make iron of a marketable quality. To make good iron from the best ironstone, it is necessary that the coal should be as free as possible from every substance with which sulphur is com bined. It should possess the property of forming a hard coke or cinder; and if it have the quality of cementing or caking, it is the more valuable, as the small coal can be used for the purpose of coking, which is frequently wasted where it does not pos sess this quality. Different opinions have been formed respecting the origin of coal. In the primary and transition mountains, a particular species of coal occurs in small quantities, which is extremely hard and splen dent, and burns without smoke or flame, and is called by mineralogists Anthracite ; it clearly re sembles, and appears to pass into the mineral called"], [203, "ORIGIN OF COAL. 161 plumbago or graphite. Common coal also some times graduates into plumbago. Plumbago and anthracite are so completely mineralized as to pre sent no external indications of a vegetable origin ; but the strata over common coal abound in vege table impressions, and the cortical part of the vege table is frequently seen converted into mineral coal. It is not often that vegetable impressions are found in the coal itself; but some of the regular coal beds in the Dudley coal-field, of which I have specimens of considerable size and thickness, are composed of distinct layers of vegetables converted into true mi neral coal ; but when separated, preserving the dis tinct cortical impressions of plants throughout the whole thickness of the coal : and it is reasonable to believe, that all the coal beds in the same field are also formed of similar plants, though the vegetable impressions may be effaced. Granting that common coal is originally derived from the partial decompo sition of vegetables, it may be fairly asked, \u2014 from whence did the vegetable tribes originally derive the carbon of which their solid parts are principally com posed? Carbon either previously existed in nature, or trees and plants had the power of forming it from more simple elements. Neither of these opinions is improbable, nor are they at variance with each other. If carbon be a compound substance, of which hydrogen is a constituent part, it may be formed by the process of vegetation, or it may exist also in the mineral kingdom, independent of or ganic productions. That carbon is an original constituent elementary part of the globe, can M"], [204, "162 ORIGIN OF COAL. scarcely be doubted, when we consider that united with oxygen it is an important constituent part of all limestone mountains, composing nearly one half by weight of their substance, or 44 of carbonic acid to 56 of lime. Now the quantity of carbon when separated from the oxygen, would be equal to one-eighth ofthe whole mass of limestone; and as all the ancient limestone formations were deposited under the ocean, we cannot suppose that this car bon was derived from the vegetable kingdom. Could the carbon be separated from the limestone in the great calcareous ranges of the Jura and the Alps, it would form abed of pure carbon, nearly a thousand feet in thickness, through the vast extent of these mountains : and were we forced to admit that this carbon was derived from organic secretion, we should rather look to the animal than the vegetable kingdom for its origin; as no small portion of many calcareous mountains is composed of animal re mains, and calcareous beds are forming in our present seas of great extent and thickness, by the accumulation of shells and coral. Bitumen, which is composed of carbon and hy drogen, is known to exude from the lava of recent volcanoes; and the volcanic tufa in Auvergne, which covers a vast extent of surface, is almost every where intermixed with bitumen. In hot weather I have seen it trickling out of the tufa in considerable quantities, resembling melted pitch. As the ancient volcanoes of that district broke out from beneath the granite, we may fairly infer, that the bitumen which abounds in the volcanic tufa is as much a"], [205, "163 WOOD-COAL. mineral substance as the sulphur which accom panies volcanic eruptions, or which is sublimed from the vapours of quiescent volcanoes. Though the carbon in primary mountains may be derived from the mineral kingdom, there can scarcely remain a doubt, that wood-coal and com mon coal are of vegetable origin. Wood-coal, or brown coal, is found in low situations, and appears to have been formed of heaps of trees buried by inundations under beds of clay, sand, or gravel. The woody parts have probably undergone a cer tain degree of vegetable fermentation, under the pressure ofthe incumbent earthy matter, by which they have been carbonized and consolidated. In some specimens of this coal, the vegetable fibre or grain is perceptible in one part, and the other part is reduced to coal. The vegetable principles which this coal contains, united with bitumen and char coal, have been already stated. In black or common coal, the vegetable extract and resin are destroyed, and the charcoal and bitumen alone remain ; but wood-coal and common coal bear in other respects too close a resemblance, to allow us to ascribe to them a different origin, though they were probably formed from different tribes in the vegetable king dom, and under different circumstances. W^ood-coal is found in considerable quantities at Bovey Heathfield, near Exeter. Several beds of coal are separated by strata of clay and gravel : the lowest is seventeen feet thick, and rests on a bed of clay, under which is sand resembling sea sand. The coal in contact with the clay has a brown colour, and appears intermixt with earth. In other parts m 2"], [206, "164 WOOD-COAL. the lamin\u00e6 of the coal undulate, and resemble the roots of trees : in the middle of the lowest stratum the coal is more compact, and is ofa black colour, and nearly as heavy as common coal. A great repository of this kind of coal exists near Cologne : it extends for many leagues : it is fifty feet in thickness, and covered with a bed of gravel from twelve to twenty feet deep. Trunks of trees deprived of their branches are imbedded in this coal ; which proves that they have been transported from a distance. Nuts, which are indigenous to Hindostan and China, and a fragrant resinous sub stance, are also found in it. A similar resinous sub stance occurs in the Bovey coal, and was discovered with fossil wood in cutting through Highgate Hill. Mr. Hatchett, by whom it was analysed, has given it the name of retinasphallum. In wood-coal we may almost seize nature in the fact of making coal, before the process is completed. These formations of coal are of far more recent date than that of common coal, though their origin must be referred to a former condition of the globe, when the vegetable productions of tropical climates flourished in northern latitudes. The vegetable origin of common mineral coal appears to be esta blished by its association with strata abounding in vegetable impressions, by its close similarity to wood coal, (which is undoubtedly a vegetable product,) and lastly, by the decisive fact, that some mineral coal in the Dudley coal-field, is entirely composed of layers of mineralized plants. But though the vegetable origin of mineral coal may be satisfactorily established, there is consider-"], [207, "COAL-BASINS. 165 able difficulty in conceiving by what process so many beds and seams of coal have been regularly arranged over each other in the same place, and separated by strata of sandstone, shale, and indu rated clay. It will tend to simplify the inquiry, if we examine a coal-field of very limited extent; such as those which occur in small coal-basins called swilleys on the hills in the west riding of York shire, and which are not more than one mile in length and breadth. It seems evident that these basins have once been small lakes or marshes, and that the strata have been deposited on the bottom and sides, taking the concave form which deposi tions under such circumstances must assume : and it is deserving notice, that the stratum of coal which in one of these coal-basins at Hudswell is a yard thick in the lowest part, gradually diminishes as it approaches the edges, and then entirely va nishes. This fact proves that the present basin shaped position of the strata was their original one ; and that the basin at the period when the coal strata were formed, was a detached lake or marsh, and not part of the bed of the sea. It has been supposed that coal strata were de posited on the bed of the ocean ; but this is not probable, for many ofthe vegetable species whose remains are found in these strata, are of marsh plants ; and some of the species of ferns are land plants, and probably grew on dry land surrounding the coal-basins when they were lakes. There is also a stratum of imperfect ironstone or highly indurated shale in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal-fields, called Musclebind, which is"], [208, "166 COAL-BASINS. filled with shells resembling freshwater muscles : and though there may be shells closely allied to them in form, in some ofthe marine limestones, it deserves notice, that the substance of the shells in the coal shale, at least wherever I have seen them in the Northern coal-fields, has that cretaceous or chalky appearance and consistence, which 1 have observed to be peculiar to shells in what are re garded as undoubted freshwater formations. If the basins in which the coal strata are depo sited were originally freshwater lakes or marshes, \u2014 did the plants whose remains compose coal, grow where the coal is now found ? or were they carried by rivers or inundations into the lakes, and gradually deposited as the water evaporated ? The former is perhaps the most probable hypothesis ; as there is reason to believe that the vegetables were prin cipally species of reeds or aquatic plants : and the occurrence of the same peculiar kind of fire clay under each bed of coal, favours the opinion, that this was the soil proper for the production of those plants from which coal has been formed. If we suppose that these lakes were periodically laid dry, and again filled by sudden inundations, we shall have the conditions required for the succession of carbonaceous and earthy strata that take place in a coal-field : a repetition of such inundations would fill up the lake or basin. Nor can such a supposi tion appear improbable ; for as the species of plants whose remains are found in the coal strata are analogous to those of warm climates, we may infer, that in a former condition of the globe, these Northern latitudes had the temperature of tropical"], [209, "167 COAL-BASINS. regions, and also the hot and rainy seasons which promote the rapid growth of vegetation, and occa sion periodical inundations. In large coal-basins, where the coal occurs in beds from nine to thirty feet in thickness, we can scarcely conceive it possible, that a mass of vege table matter sufficiently large to form such beds, can have been collected in one season : these thick beds are, however, almost always divided by thin seams of clay. The thirty feet coal of Staffordshire is composed of thirteen different beds, which, hav ing but thin partings, are regarded as one bed. The thirteen feet bed of coal at Ashby Wolds is composed of two or more beds of different qualities. It is probable that some of the coal strata in large coal-basins have been formed by the accumu lation of vegetable matter carried down by inunda tions, and gradually deposited in the bottom of lakes. Very thin seams of coal sometimes alternate with the shale lying between two large beds of coal. I have on the table before me, a mass from the Dud ley coal-field, in which part of two beds of coal are separated by a stratum of indurated clay or shale about two inches in thickness ; and this stratum of shale contains more than twenty seams of coal, none of which exceed the thickness of a wafer, but the coal seams are distinctly separated from each other by seams of shale. These thin seams of coal and shale were probably formed by the alternate deposition of leaves or minute aquatic plants floating on the water, with the earthy particles mechanically suspended in it. In very large coal-fields, the ori ginal form of the basin or lake in which the strata"], [210, "168 CONVERSION OF were deposited, is sometimes nearly effaced by faults and dislocations, which have raised or cast down the strata several hundred feet; but m the smaller basins or coal-fields, the original form is often distinctly preserved. The plants whose remains are found in coal-fields possess little ligneous internal matter, but appear to belong- chiefly to species of reeds and succulent vegetables ; the stems of the larger plants being either pressed flat, or filled with sandstone, iron stone, or indurated clay, without any vestige of or ganization except the pith, the form of which is pre served in many of the large stems. In some places, where sections are made in sandstone strata accom panying coal, instances of fossil stems of large plants occur in a vertical position. In Burntwood quarry at Althouse, near Wakefield in Yorkshire, several vertical stems of large magnitude have been found. One stem which 1 measured in the quarry was nine feet in length and ten inches in thickness ; but what is remarkable, this stem cut through three strata of sandstone, parted by regular strata-seams : it had therefore probably grown in the situation where it stood ; for it is difficult to believe that any vegetable stem could pierce through three strata of sandstone, the lower of which at least must have been partly consolidated. This fact further proves, that the strata were deposited rapidly, before the decomposi tion of the stem could be effected. The difficulty in explaining the conversion of ve getable matter into coal, has been in a great measure removed, by the luminous observations and experi ments of Dr. MacCulloch, on wood in its different"], [211, "169 VEGETABLE MATTER INTO COAL states of bitumenization, from submerged wood, to peat, brown coal, surturbrand, and lastly to jet, in which the traces of organization are nearly destroy ed. These substances, which have been only sub jected to the action of water, all yield bitumen by gentle distillation : but they differ from mineral coal, by yielding also a large portion of acetic acid, which marks the remains of undecayed vegetable sub stances. Common coal has formerly been regarded as a combination of charcoal with bitumen ; but as bitumen is itself a combination of carbon with hydro gen, Dr. MacCulloch says, it will be more proper to consider coal as a bitumen, varying in its com position from the fattest Newcastle coal to the driest Kilkenny coal, and owing its compactness to the peculiar circumstances under which it has been formed, the changes it may have subsequently undergone, and the substances intermixed with it. The power of yielding naphtha by distillation, is the distinction between one end of the series and the other. The last link (anthracite,) contains only carbon; so the last result of the distillation of asphal tum is also carbon. To convert wood-coal or jet into true coal, some further process than long submersion in water seems necessary. The latter substance, jet, was reduced to powder, and put into a gun-barrel and covered close with Stourbridge clay ; it was then exposed to a moderate red heat. By this process, it was converted into a substance having all the external characters and chemical properties of true mineral coal, and the clay was converted into coal shale. But though in the laboratory ofthe chemist the last stage"], [212, "170 ON IRREGULAR of the formation of coal requires artificial fire, yet in the great laboratory of Nature, vegetable fer mentation and compression, may evolve sufficient heat for the ultimate formation of mineral coal. It may however deserve notice, that most great repo sitories of coal are intersected by beds and dykes of basalt, which is now admitted to be of igneous orig-in *. Pressure and time alone may be sufficient to pro duce the destruction of vegetable organization, and the perfect consolidation of beds of coal, as is proved by the complete consolidation of loose materials left in coal mines, when the supports are removed and the upper strata sink down, ln a few years scarcely a trace of former operations remains. In contem plating natural causes, we are too apt to measure their power by the results of artificial processes, and by observations continued for a short portion of hu man life. The substances found in the neglected vessels ofthe chemist, often prove to us that changes in the physical properties of bodies are effected by time, which it would be difficult to imitate in com mon experiments. The great coal formation appears to be confined to the lower secondary strata, generally resting on transition limestone. In some situations, the under transition rocks are wanting, and the series of coal * At Meisner in Hesse, a thick bed of wood-coal or lignite is covered by an enormous mass of basalt, and is only separated from it by a thin bed of clay. The upper parts ofthe lignite are converted into anthracite and even into true bituminous coal, while the lower parts are formed of earthy and fibrous wood -coal."], [213, "171 COAL FORMATIONS. strata rest on granite, with the intervention ofa thick bed of conglomerate. No mineral coal, both good in quality and abundant in quantity, has ever been found either in the primary or in the lower transi tion rocks, or in the upper secondary or the tertiary strata. It is true, that in the oolite of the upper se condary strata, some strata of imperfect coal occur on the eastern moorlands of Yorkshire, which are thought of sufficient importance to be worked; but the coal is very indifferent, and is chiefly used by the lime-burners. The Kimmeridge-clay in the oolites, also contains beds of shale impregnated with bitu men, which is used as fuel in a country where coal is extremely dear. The wood-coal of Bovey Heath field has been already noticed. I may state in ad dition, that I visited the mine in 1815 : it is worked like an open quarry ; it had been for some years previously under water, but was then laid dry by pumps. There are several irregular beds of lignite or wood-coal alternating with what is called dead coal, which is less inflammable, and resembles a bituminous shale ; the beds wedge out narrow as they descend. The whole mass is more or less bi tuminized: but the upper part, which preserves the woody structure more perfectly, seems principally composed of clay. Sulphate and carbonate of iron occur in some part of the beds, and rounded pieces of maltha. Wood-coal occurs chiefly in diluvial deposits. Where wood-coal occurs with overlying basalt, it is converted into a substance more nearly resembling mineral coal. This has been called by the German geologists the floetz trap formation. This coal occurs in Iceland, in the north of Ireland,"], [214, "172 COAL MINES IN THE ALPS. and in many basaltic districts on the conti nent. Be fore concluding this brief account of imperfect coal formations, out of the limits of the regular coal formation, I would direct the attention of geologists to two situations, in which coal is found, that are well deserving of notice. The first is the mine of Entreveines, situated in a mountain valley about 2000 feet above the lake of Annecy, and at least 3500 feet above the level of the sea. The bed of coal consists of three minor beds, separated by thin seams of clay varying in thickness, yielding about four feet of good coal, which has the character and fracture of mineral coal ; it is shining, does not soil the fingers, and is highly bituminous, being ex clusively used for the gas lights in the cotton-mills at Annecy. The total thickness of the sandstone shale and coal strata, which compose the coal for mation in this place, is about one hundred and fifty yards ; they are placed between thick beds of lime stone, and dip together at an angle of about seventy degrees. It is worthy of observation, that the lime stone beds above and below the coal formation, have the hardness, fracture, transluency, and appearance of the transition limestone at Plymouth; yet in another part of the mountain, the same limestone is associated with a bed of dark clay, containing gryphites and belemnites, clearly indicating that the bed was analogous to our lias or clunch clay; and that the limestone associated with it, notwith standing its mineral character, belonged to the upper secondary strata; and hence that the coal, in geological position, agreed with the imperfect coal formations in the English oolites. Here then we"], [215, "COAL OF ALPNACH. 173 have a further proof of what has before been stated, that in the calcareous formations of the Alps, the upper secondary strata lose the soft and earthy cha- racter which distinguish the oolites and chalk in England, and are converted into marble. The coal also, which is very imperfectly formed in the En- glish oolite, has in the same limestone formation in the Alps, the character of true mineral coal. A still more remarkable coal formation occurs at AIp- nach, near the lake of Lucerne in Switzerland, where a bed of coal is found at the depth of two hundred and eighty feet from the surface : over the coal, there is a stratum of bituminous limestone containing fluviatile shells, and bones and teeth of the large mammalia, particularly the teeth of a spe- cies of mastodon. The specimens which were shown me by Professor Meissner of Berne, on my return from the Swiss Alps, made me regret exceedingly not having visited Alpnach. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the bones of large land quadrupeds in the stratum over the coal, the coal approaches in character nearly to mineral coal, and the strata of micaceous sandstone and shale above it, have a close resemblance to those in our English coal-fields: and though from the organic remains, we are compelled to place the coal of Alpnach among the tertiary strata, or to admit the occurrence of an anomalous formation like the one at Stonesfield, still I believe the true geological position of the coal of Alpnach is problematical ; and it deserves the particular at tention of some English geologist, well acquainted with the different coal-fields in his own country, and the lignite formations in different parts of Europe."], [216, "174 ON SEARCHING FOR COAL It will be seen by a reference to the Geological Map, and the Chapter containing an Outline of the Geology of England, that there is a considerable part of South Britain where coal has not been j'ound. Two important questions may be asked ; \u2014 do the coal strata extend under the parts where coal has not yet been discovered ? And if they do extend beyond their present known limits, \u2014 whatpracticable means can be employed to obtain the coal? With respect to the first question \u2014 it is well ascertained by boring, that the coal strata do in some places extend under the magnesian limestone, by which they are imme diately covered in some ofthe Northern counties; though it was formerly supposed, that the coal terminated before it reached the magnesian lime stone, or was there cut off by a fault, ln a con siderable part of England, the coal-fields are imme diately covered by what is called the red marie or new red sandstone; but there are but few situations where the red marie and sandstone has been sunk through for coal. I am however decidedly of opinion, that under the red marie adjacent to the coal districts in my native county Nottinghamshire, the regular coal strata would be found ; and that there is a high degree of probability, that rock salt or brine springs will be found in the red marie itself, particularly in those parts of the county w here beds of massive gypsum occur. The same remark might be extended to the red marie and sandstone districts adjoining coal strata in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Warwickshire. In confirmation of the opinion here advanced, a saline spring has very recently been discovered about four miles north-west of"], [217, "175 IN NEW SITUATIONS. Nottingham ; and coal has been lately found under the red marie and sandstone on the south side of Charnwood Forest, where it had not before been suspected to exist. It may however be proper to say, that no search of this kind by boring should be un dertaken by any one, to whom the expense in case of failure would be a serious inconvenience. The dip and direction of the strata in the coal fields nearest to the estate where the search is to be made, should be well known. If the strata dip towards the estate, it is probable the coal may ex tend under it : if they dip from it, the search should not be undertaken. To make this intelligible, see Plate3. fig. 3. a. a, a. are a series of coal strata, or, as they are provincially called, coal measures, dipping toward the side b. c. c. c. are strata of red marie or sandstone, lying unconformably over the coal strata. Now according to this arrangement, a search for coal might be successful, though the bed might be at too great a depth to be worked. Whereas on an estate at d, as the coal strata dip from it, were we to bore to the centre of the earth, we could never find the beds 1. 2. 3. 4. If the estate b is situated a considerable distance from a known coal-field, the strata of coal may bend as represented Plate3. fig. 2. and crop out before they reach the station where the trial is made; and as the outcrop is covered by the red sandstone, this cannot be known but by trial. Rock salt or brine springs are most likely to be found in the vicinity of massive gypsum, wthout regarding the stratification. As for the districts where the upper secondary strata of lias, oolite, and chalk occur, all search for the regular coal strata"], [218, "176 LOCALITIES OF COAL. must there be fruitless ; as the vast thickness of these calcareous formations precludes the hope of suc cess. Coal mines, it is well known, are subject to fatal explosions of what is called the sire-damp, or carbu retted hydrogen gas. This gas appears to be gene rated by the decomposition of iron pyrites in coal, and may often be heard issuing from the fissures in coal beds with a bubbling noise, as it forces the water out along with it. The choke damp, as it is called, is either carbonic acid gas (fixed air), or the unrespirable residue of air left after explosions, when all the oxygen is consumed, ln the Appendix will be given some observations on the ineffective means hitherto adopted, to prevent the frequent re currence of fatal accidents in coal mines. The regular or great coal formation, has never been discovered at a very considerable elevation above the level of the sea : it generally is found towards the feet of great mountain chains, or in the valleys near to lofty mountain ranges. The geo logy of large portions of the globe is still unknown ; but it appears from those parts with which we are acquainted, that coal is principally found in tem perate regions, between thirty-five and sixty-five degrees of latitude. In Europe, \u2014 Great Britain, France, Flanders, and Germany, (particularly Si lesia, Saxony, Bohemia, and Thuringia,) contain large coal formations; but in the southern and more northern parts of Europe, coal is of rare occurrence. In North America, coal is found in great abundance on the western side of the Alleghany mountains ; near Pittsburg in Pennsylvania, the beds of coal,"], [219, "177 COAL FORMATIONS IN FRANCE. I am informed, are of great extent, and are so nearly horizontal, that in one situation the bed ofa river is formed for several miles in the same stratum of coal. Coal has been discovered in New Holland. The only great coal formations in Asia that we know of are in China, where coal is described as existing in large quantities, and as being extensively used for fuel in that vast empire. As France will probably continue to be for many centuries our great manufacturing rival, it is inter esting to know, what are her resources for the sup ply of an article found so essential to almost all the principal manufactures of Great Britain. Before the late peace, forty-seven of the departments con tained coal districts, and the annual consumption was stated to be about five million tons ; but a great part of the rich and extensive coal-field ex tending from Valenciennes to Aix-la-Chapelle was comprised in that part of Flanders, which was sepa rated from France at the peace. There are, how ever, extensive coal districts in the north-eastern, the western, the middle, and the southern parts of France. Two miles from Lyons there are coal mines; and the coal of St. Etienne, about twenty miles north-west of Lyons, is of the very best qua lity, and well suited for the manufacture of iron. In the year 1822, when I passed through that coun try, many English workmen were employed in the iron-works, which were rapidly increasing. It cannot be doubted that France possesses every ad vantage, from its soil, its climate, and its mineral resources, which a great manufacturing nation can require."], [220, "178 EXHAUSTION OF COAL IN ENGLAND. Observations on the Period when the Coal Mines in England will be exhausted. Coal was known, and partially used, at a very early period of our history. I was informed by the late Marquis of Hastings, that stone hammers and stone tools were found in some of thc old workings in his mines at Ashby Wolds ; and His Lordship in formed me also, that similar stone tools had been discovered in the old workings in the coal mines in the north of Ireland. Hence we may infer, that these coal mines were worked at a very re mote period, when the use of metallic tools was not general. The burning of coal was prohibited in London in the year 1308, by the royal proclamation of Edward the First. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the burning of coal was again prohibited in London during the sitting of parliament, lest the health of the knights of the shire should suffer injury during their abode in the metropolis. In the year 1643, the use of coal had become so general, and the price being then very high, many of the poor are said to have perished for want of fuel. At the present day, when the consumption of coal, in our iron-furnaces and manufactories and for domestic use, is immense, we cannot but regard the exhaustion of our coal beds, as involving the de struction of a great portion of our private comfort and national prosperity. Nor is the period very remote when the coal dis stricts, which at present supply the metropolis with fuel, will cease to yield any more. The annual quantity of coal shipped in the rivers Tyne and Wear, according to Mr. Bailey ex ceeded three million tons. A cubic yard of coal weighs nearly one ton, and the number of tons contained in a bed of coal one square mile in extent and one yard in thickness, is about four millions. The number and extent of all the principal coal beds in Northumberland and Durham is known ; and from these data it has been calculated, that the coal in these counties will last 360 years. Mr. Bailey in his Survey of Durham states, that one third of the coal being already got, the coal districts will be ex hausted in 200 years. It is probable that many beds of inferior coal, which are now neglected, may in future be worked ; but the consumption of coal being greatly increased since Mr. Bailey published his Survey of Durham, we may admit his calculation"], [221, "EXHAUSTION OF COAL IN ENGLAND. 179 to be an approximation to the truth, and that the coal of North- umberland and Durham will be exhausted in a period not greatly exceeding 200 years. Dr. Thomson, in the Annals of Philosophy, has calculated that the coal of these districts, at the present rate of consumption, will last 1000 years ; but his calcu lations are founded on data manifestly erroneous, and at variance with his own statements : for he assumes the annual consump tion of coal to be only two million eight hundred thousand tons, and thewaste to be one-third more, \u2014 making three million seven hundred thousand tons, equal to as many square yards ; whereas he has just before informed us, that two million chaldrons of coal, of two tons and a quarter each chaldron, are exported, making four million five hundred thousand tons, beside inland consumption, and waste in the working*. According to Mr. Winch, three million five hundred thousand tons of coal are con sumed annually from these districts ; to which if we add the waste of small coal at the pit's mouth, and the waste in the mines, it will make the total yearly destruction of coal nearly double the quantity assigned by Dr. Thomson. Dr. Thomson has also greatly overrated the quantity of the coal in these districts, as he has calculated the extent of the principal beds from that of the lowest, which is erroneous ; for many of the principal beds crop out, before they reach the western termination of the coal fields. With due allowance for these errors, and for the quan tity of coal already worked out, (which according to Mr. Bailey is about one-third), the 1000 years of Dr. Thomson will not greatly exceed the period assigned by Mr. Bailey for the com plete exhaustion of coal in these counties, and may be stated at three hundred and fifty years. It cannot be deemed uninteresting to inquire what are the repositories of coal that can supply the metropolis and the south ern counties, when no more can be obtained from the Tyne and the Wear. The only coal-fields of any extent on the eastern side of England between London and Durham, are those of Derby shire and those in the west riding of Yorkshire. The Derbyshire * The waste of coal at the pit's mouth may be stated at one sixth of the quantity sold, and that left in the mines at one-third. Mr. Holmes, in his Treatise on Coal Mines, states the waste of small coal at the pit's mouth to be one-fourth of the whole. N 2"], [222, "180 EXHAUSTION OF COAL IN ENGLAND. coal-field is not of sufficient magnitude to supply, for any long period, more than is required for home consumption, and that of the adjacent counties. There are many valuable beds of coal in the western part of the west riding of Yorkshire which are yet unwrought ; but the time is not very distant when they must be put in requisition, to supply the vast demand of that populous manufacturing county, which at present con sumes nearly all the produce of its own coal mines. In the midland counties, Staffordshire possesses the nearest coal dis trict to the metropolis, of any great extent ; but such is the immense daily consumption of coal in the iron-furnaces and founderies, that it is generally believed this will be the first of our own coal-fields that will be exhausted. The thirty-feet bed of coal in the Dudley coal-field is of limited extent ; and in the present mode of working it, more than two-thirds of the coal is wasted and left in the mine. If we look to Whitehaven or Lancashire, or to any of the minor coal-fields in the west of England, we can derive little hope of their being able to supply London and the southern counties with coal, after the import of coal fails from Northum berland and Durham. We may thus anticipate a period not very remote, when all the English mines of coal and ironstone will be exhausted : and were we disposed to indulge in gloomy forebodings, like the ingenious authoress of the \"Last Man,\" we might draw a melancholy picture of our starving and declining population, and describe some manufacturing patriarch, like the late venerable Richard Reynolds, travelling to see the last ex piring English furnace, before he emigrated to distant regions*. * The late Richard Reynolds, Esq. of Bristol, so distin guished for his unbounded benevolence, was the original pro prietor ofthe great iron-works in Colebrook Dale, Shropshire. Owing, I believe, partly to the exhaustion of the best workable beds of coal and ironstone, and partly to the superior advan tages possessed by the iron-founders in South Wales, the works at Colebrook Dale were finally relinquished, a short time before the death of Mr. Reynolds. With a natural attachment to the scenes where he had passed his early years, and to the pursuits by which he had honourably acquired his great wealth, he travelled from Bristol into Shropshire, to he present when the last of his furnaces was extinguished, in a valley where they had been con tinually burning for more than halfa century."], [223, "181 EXHAUSTION OF COAL IN ENGLAND. Fortunately, however, we have in South Wales, adjoining the Bristol Channel, an almost exhaustless supply of coal and ironstone, which are yet nearly unwrought. It has been stated in the present chapter, that this coal-field extends over about twelve hundred square miles, and that there are twenty-three beds of workable coal, the total average thickness of which is 95 feet, and the quantity contained in each acre is 100,000 tons, or 65,000,000 tons per square mile. If from this we deduct one half for waste and for the minor extent of the upper beds, we shall have a clear supply of coal, equal to 32,000,000 tons per square mile. Now if we admit that the five million tons of coal from the Northumberland and Durham mines is equal to nearly one-third of the total consumption of coal in England, each square mile of the Welch coal-field would yield coal for two years' consumption ; and as there are from one thousand to twelve hundred square miles in this coal-field, it would supply England with fuel for two thousand years, after all our English coal mines are worked out. It is true, that a considerable part of the coal in South Wales is of an inferior quality, and is not at present burned for domestic use ; but in proportion as coal becomes scarce, improved methods of burning it will assuredly be discovered, to prevent any sul phurous fumes from entering apartments, and also to economize the consumption of fuel in all our manufacturing processes. N.B. These observations are taken from one of the author's geological lectures, which he has occasionally delivered in some of the principal mining districts In England : considering the great national importance of our coal mines, he trusts he shall be excused for inserting them in the present volume."], [224, "182 CHAPTER IX.

Next succeed the slate rocks d d, with imbedded or subordinate beds of flinty slate, or"], [225, "183 CONFORMABLE ROCKS. limestone (1). Then follow beds (2) of conglome rate, separating the slate from the transition lime stone and greywaeke (2. d.d). And lastly, the lower secondary strata, comprising the great coal forma tion. This representation is, however, rather de scriptive of a general tendency to such an arrange ment, than of its universal occurrence. Frequently different parts of the series will be wanting in dif ferent situations. Thus in Cornwall the gneiss and the mica-slate are absent, except in two localities. At the Malvern Hills, transition limestone rises almost close to the rocks of granite : and the coalformation of St. Etienne in France is only separated from the granite, on which it reposes, by a thick bed of con glomerate, containing rounded stones of vast size, belonging to rocks of the primary class. Here all the intervening formations, 6. c. d. and e. Plate 3. fig. 1. are wanting. Whether they were originally deposited, and have been subsequently removed, by the agency of some unknown cause, before the de position of the coal strata, is an inquiry that can only be answered by conjectures and references to analogies : the subject will be hereafter adverted to. It is sufficient to our present purpose to remark, that where the different formations that are wanting in one place occur in another, they generally cover each other conformably in the order above de scribed. The upper secondary and the tertiary strata, that succeed the different classes of rocks which occur conformably, appear to have been deposited not only ata later period, but under different circumstances; for their position does notconform to that ofthe lower"], [226, "184 POSITION AND FORMATION OF rocks, but they cover the outcrop or basset of the lower beds, as represented Plate I . fig. 3 ; they are unconformable stratified rocks. Before we proceed to describe the upper secon dary strata, it will be necessary to bestow particular attention on a class of rocks, that has greatly per plexed the speculations of geologists : they are the unconformable rocks of porphyry, trap, and basalt, which form the subjectofthepresent chapter. These rocks, though they sometimes occur imbedded in conformable rocks, more frequently cover them in an unconformable position, composing thick un stratified beds, and often mountain masses of vast size, that have not unfrequently a columnar struc ture. Their position is represented Plate 3. fig. 2. It is obvious that these unconformable rocks were formed and deposited, at a subsequent period to that in which the lower rocks were consolidated, and their beds had acquired their present inclined po sitions. As the unconformable massive or unstra tified rocks, are many, if not all of them, allied to rocks whose igneous origin is now undisputed, we might have little difficulty in admitting that they had been poured over the surface of the conform able rocks in a state of fusion, like streams of lava from recent volcanoes; with this difference, that they were not erupted from one opening or crater, but from fissures of great width and many miles or leagues in extent, and that they were formed under the ocean. I say we might have little difficulty in admitting this, particularly as such rents or fissures, filled with similar matter to that of the overlying unconformable masses, are often discovered in their"], [227, "185 UNCONFORMABLE MASSIVE ROCKS. vicinity : but there are other appearances which seem opposed to the igneous origin of these rocks. In the first place, similar rocks to the overlying forma tions, are often imbedded and intermixed with con formable rocks in a conformable position : and se condly, some overlying formations, appear to pass by gradation into rocks of the primary class. Now if we admit the unconformable masses to be of ig neous origin, we can scarcely refuse the same origin to the imbedded rocks; and thus we extend the do main of Pluto over a larger portion of the crust of the globe, than many geologists will allow. It must also be granted, that many of the imbedded rocks of porphyry and porphyritic trap, which alternate or are intermixed with slate rocks, cannot be supposed to have ever been erupted like lava; but they may have been softened by subterranean heat in situ, and have taken the porphyritic texture, and the columnar structure, during their slow refrigeration. If we sufficiently keep in view that the crust of the globe with which we are acquainted, does not ex ceed, in comparative thickness, that of a wafer to an artificial globe three feet in diameter ; and that a very large portion of the globe is now or has in ancient times been rent and pierced through by active volcanoes, and that these volcanoes are not the seat of subterranean fire, but merely its chim- neys, we shall have no difficulty in admitting, that extensive parts of the crust of the globe may have been softened by internal heat, and the more fusible beds partly crystallized in situ, under the pressure of the ocean . Trap rocks sometimes occur between thick beds"], [228, "186 TRAP ROCKS. of marine limestone ; but in such instances, we may without much difficulty admit that these trap rocks have been formed by submarine volcanoes, which have poured beds of lava over the limestone ; an other bed of limestone may have been subsequently formed over the lava, and this limestone may also have been covered by the lava of a later eruption. In this manner the alternation of beds of basalt, or basaltic amygdaloid with limestone in Derbyshire, may admit ofa probable explanation. With respect to the overlying formations which pass by gradation into primary rocks, as some por phyries allied to volcanic rocks pass into granite, \u2014 this fact, so far from proving that the porphyry was not of igneous origin, would tend to confirm the hypothesis which attributes an igneous formation to granite itself*. It is granted by the best ob- * However highly and justly distinguished many of the na tural philosophers in France may be, it cannot be denied that they adhere more closely to theories once formed, and have a greater dread of thinking for themselves, than the philosophers of other countries. In confirmation of this, I shall translate an extractfrom M. Bonnard's Aperc.u Geognostique des Terrains. It is truly amusing to see the alarm which he evinces, lest he should be compelled by stubborn facts to relinquish his cherished theories. \u2014 \"Another species of difficulty should prevent every prudent man (esprit sage) from attempting to explain the formation of these rocks of trachyte by any hypothesis founded on volcanic action ; namely, the alarming extent of the consequences which may follow such an explication, re lative to other rock formations, hitherto regarded as having a very different origin.\" With great respect for M. Bonnard, I would say, Let every esprit sage yield to the evidence which Nature presents, and leave consequences and theories to take care of themselves."], [229, "TRAP ROCKS. 187 servers, that a regular gradation may be traced be tween granite and the more ancient volcanic rocks, and that there is likewise a gradation between the products of ancient and recent volcanoes. Of the former we shall cite a well attested instance : but before proceeding, it will be proper to give a more ample description of trap rocks than has yet been done. It has already been stated, that rocks com posed of felspar and hornblende, received the ge neric name of Trap rocks, (a name derived from the Swedish word trappa a stair,) because these rocks frequently divide into regular forms resembling the steps of stairs. Beside the intermixture of felspar and hornblende, there is also a frequent intermix ture of felspar with augite, to which the name of trap rock is given : indeed, hornblende and augite resemble each other so much in chemical composi tion, and when uncrystallized, in external character also, that they have till recently been confounded together, and they often occur together in the same rock. These compounds of felspar and horn blende, and felspar and augite, form the different rocks called greenstone, sienitic greenstone, ba salt, clinkstone, pitchstone, wacke, and amygda loid ; and also trap, porphyry, and pitchstone-por phyry. All these rocks may be regarded as dif ferent modes and combinations of felspar with horn blende or augite, differing chiefly in their internal structure. When hornblende and felspar have a granitic structure, they form what is generally called green stone, and if the felspar be red, sienitic greenstone. When hornblende and felspar, or augite and felspar,"], [230, "188 BASALT AND WACKE. are intimately combined and finely granular, they form basalt. The French geologists make a distinc tion between the basalt in which augite prevails, and that which is composed of felspar and hornblende; but it is admitted that where the structure is finely granular, or nearly compact, it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish them. Basalt has a greenish or brownish black colour, is difficult to break, and possesses a considerable degree of hardness ; it will however yield to the point of a knife. On examination with a lens, even the more compact varieties of basalt are seen to be composed of minute crystalline grains ; it frequently contains yellowish grains of a mineral called oli vine; it contains also grains of iron-sand, and a con siderable portion of the black oxide of iron. Ba salt is fusible into a black glass, and is magnetic. The iron which it contains, passes into a further state of oxygenation when exposed to the air: hence basaltic rocks are generally covered with a reddish brown incrustation. Very black basalts are chiefly composed of augite. Soft earthy basalt intermixed with green earth forms the rock called wacke. When basalt or wacke contain rounded cavities, filled with zeolites, chal cedony, or calcareous spar, they form amygdaloid*. When the felspar greatly prevails, and the texture becomes nearly compact, basalt passes into the rock called phonolite or clinkstone, from its yielding a * The names Porphyry and Amygdaloid rather represent modes than substances, and convey no precise ideas unless the nature of the base be specified."], [231, "GRADATIONS OF TRAP ROCKS. 189 metallic sound when struck : the prevailing colour is gray and greenish gray; it is fusible. Clinkstone when it has a more earthy texture, passes into the rock called by English geologists Claystone. Clink stone often contains imbedded crystals of felspar, and then becomes a trap porphyry, which varies in colour according to the prevailing ingredients of its base. Between felspar porphyry and trap por phyry there is an almost imperceptible transition ; in the former, the base or paste is felspar, nearly pure. Some felspar porphyries pass gradually into granite, by an intermixture with quartz and mica. Pitchstone has a blackish green, or a nearly black colour; it is a semivitreous substance, having the lustre and appearance of pitch ; it is composed of the same constituent parts as basalt, and approaches nearly to the black volcanic glass called obsidian, which is a lava suddenly refrigerated and perfectly vitrified. Pitchstone and obsidian are sometimes porphyritic. Hence we have on the one hand a se ries of rocks, (varying only in the increase of fel spar, and state of induration,) from granular basalt to clinkstone and claystone, from clinkstone to trap porphyry, from trap porphyry to trachyte and fel spar porphyry, and from felspar porphyry, with the further admixture of mica and quartz, to granitic porphyry and granite. On the other hand, from granitic greenstone there is a transition to sienite, and from sienite to true granite. Again: in the volcanic districts of Auvergne, we see scoriaceous lava become more compact, and at length pass into well characterized black basalt, with the columnar structure. In other situations, currents of lava"], [232, "190 PASSAGE OF TRAP ROCKS form obsidian or volcanic glass; and between basalt, phonolite, and pitchstone, there is an almost im perceptible gradation. Thus it may be seen that the whole family of trap rocks have on the one hand a close alliance with volcanic rocks ; and on the other, with the more ancient rocks of porphyry and granite. The gradation of trap rock, having in some parts a volcanic character, into true granite, has been described by Messrs. Hausmann and Von Buch as distinctly observable, and well marked, in a moun tain near Christiania in Norway. The lower rocks are gneiss; over this occurs dark slate; and in the slate are several beds of blackish limestone, contain ing trilobites, and also orthoceratites several feet in length, with other marine organic remains. In some parts, a bed of gritstone or greywaeke rests on the slate. The whole of these beds are covered by an enormous mass of porphyry, varying in thick ness from 1600 to 2000 feet. The porphyry is of a smoke gray colour, but is reddish in some parts ; it is compact, and moderately hard, and contains large crystals of white felspar, and crystals of quartz, epidote, hornblende, iron pyrites, and magnetic iron ore. In the lower part of the bed the por phyry becomes vesicular, and changes into an amygdaloidal basalt, containing crystals of augite. Near- the sea, vast dykes of this porphyry, more than thirty yards in width, are seen cutting through the slate and beds of limestone. In another part ofthe country, at Holmestrand, the same mass of porphyry, covering beds of sandstone, is seen to pass in the lower part, by almost insensible grada-"], [233, "INTO PORPHYRY, SIENITE, AND GRANITE. 191 tions, into ahard fine-grained black basalt, contain ing brilliant crystals of augite : in the upper part of the bed, the porphyry passes into a sienite of sin gular beauty, containing crystals of zircon ; and above this, the sienite passes into common granite. The dykes of porphyry cutting through the slate rocks indicate the mode of formation of this por phyry, in a manner not to be mistaken by those who are acquainted with the basaltic dykes in the northern parts of Great Britain. These dykes were doubtless the fissures through which this vast mass of porphyry had been poured out over the slate rocks, though Messrs. Hausmann and Von Buch de scribe them as veins descending from the porphyry. The reader may form a more distinct idea of the position of this porphyry and its relation to the sub jacent rocks, which are intersected by dykes of the same porphyry, from Plate 3. fig. 2. a. Had M. Von Buch seen this remarkable mass of porphyry at Christiania, after his visit to the ba saltic districts in England, he would, I am persuaded, have at once recognized the agency of subterranean fire in its formation. I saw this eminent geologist soon after his return from Cumberland and West moreland; and if I recollect distinctly his opinion respecting the mountains of porphyritic trap and clinkstone intermixed with slate in these counties, it was, that they bore a striking resemblance to some ofthe most ancient volcanic mountains in Auvergne, and that, like them, they had been softened in situ, and elevated by subterranean heat. The operation of igneous agency in these mountains is much less evident than in the porphyry of Norway, if the"], [234, "192 CRATERS IN ANCIENT TRAP ROCKS. description given of it be correct. The only porphy ry occurring in unconformable beds that I have seen in Cumberland or Westmoreland, covers part of a mountain of coarse slate on the right-hand side of the road going from Kendal to the granite mountain of Shap. It forms a nearly horizontal bed composed of red felspar, which has an earthy texture, and con tains crystals or grains of quartz ; it is what the French would denominate a red trachyte. Con siderable fragments ofthe same rock are scattered in the adjacent valleys, proving that at a former period, this porphyry was more extensively spread over that district. A red porphyritic felspar, nearly similar in composition and appearance, forms the top of the mountain called Red Pike above the Lake of Butter mere in Cumberland. Closely adjacent to Red Pike, and forming part of the same ridge, is the moun tain called High Stile. Between the summits of these mountains, is a deep crater with a small lake or tarn al the bottom of it : the sides of this crater are very steep; it is partly surrounded by rude columns of clinkstone on one side ; the porphyritic felspar of Red Pike forms the other side. The clinkstone has a smooth conchoidal fracture and a greenish gray colour; it contains small crystals of felspar, and is slightly translucent on the edges and very fusible; it is highly sonorous when struck with a hammer. The height of High Stile is 2100 feet above the level of the sea; the depth of the crater is about 500 feet; the side nearest the Lake of Buttermere, by which alone it can be entered, is partly open. Situated as it is on the summit of a very narrow steep moun tain range, that divides the valley of Buttermere"], [235, "193 CRATERS IN ANCIENT TRAP ROCKS. from Ennerdale, no conceivable operation of water could have scooped out the crater, and the bed of the lake within it. Though the rocks which surround this crater are closely allied to volcanic rocks, and have probably been subjected to the agency of fire, we cannot sup pose the crater to have been formed like that of modern volcanoes, by eruption of lava and scori\u00e6. It seems more reasonable to admit that the crater might owe its form to a partial sinking down of part ofthe summit of the mountain, when the rocks of which it is composed were softened by subterranean heat, and elevated : the basin of the Lake of Butter mere, at the foot of this mountain, may perhaps owe its original depression to the same cause. Many of the mountains in these districts are composed of porphyritic trap, passing into clinkstone. In a deep ravine of Swarthfell in Cumberland, opposite the seat of J. Marshall, Esq. M.P., the mountain which is here composed of clinkstone, presents the colum nar structure on a magnificent scale ; the columns are slightly bent and inclined. Porphyry, from an intermixture with hornblende frequently passes into sienite ; when this is the case, the latter rock generally forms the upper part of the mass. Porphyry and basalt, in enormous masses, often cover the primary mountains in the Andes. According to Humboldt, \" they are arranged in re gular columns, which strike the eye of the traveller like immense castles lifted into the sky.\" Some geologists describe four formations of porphyry, but this division is purely theoretical, as those who ad mit it, agree that the different formations of porphyry o"], [236, "194 PORPHYRITIC TRAP. frequently pass into each other; and from the evident connection of porphyry and basaltic with igneous rocks, it naturally follows, that such transitions must take place. Porphyritic rocks may in general be regarded as more ancient than basaltic rocks, as porphyry most frequently occurs intermixed with, or covering transition rocks, and basalt is most com monly associated with the secondary strata, which it either cuts through in the form of dykes, or covers unconformably. Sometimes itappearsto havebroken through the strata confusedly, and to have enveloped large portions of other rocks. We shall proceed to describe these different modes of its occurrence and position, of which we have numerous striking ex amples in Great Britain and Ireland. In describing the phenomena presented by any one ofthe trap rocks, we describe those peculiar to every member ofthe trap family. Were it allowed to express a geological fact in familiar terms, it might be said, that all the members of this family give in dications of a fiery character, and of having been troublesome neighbours to the adjacent rocks, dis turbing them, and even changing their nature, when they are closely associated. Beside occurring in overlying unconformable masses, all trap rocks, with porphyry, which may be placed at their head, are occasionally found intersecting other rocks like vertical walls. It has been before stated, that these vertical walls are called dykes, \u2014 the term dyke and wall being synonymous in North Britain. The substance which most commonly occurs in dykes is basalt ; and as these basaltic dykes are well known, from their frequently intersecting coal strata, we"], [237, "BASALTIC DYKES. 195 shall now give a description of basaltic dykes, and their effects on the adjacent rocks or strata. The thickness of dykes varies from a few inches to twenty or thirty feet or yards ; in some instances they exceed three hundred feet. The extent to which they stretch across a country has seldom been explored beyond the mining districts, where a know ledge of them is important on account ofthe disturb ances which they occasion in the strata. The intersection of coal strata by dykes is re presented Plate4. fig. 2. and 3. c. c. and d. d. Dykes generally decline a little from a vertical position; and, as before stated, the depth to which they descend is unknown. The strata are almost always thrown down on one side of a dyke, and elevated on the other ; but the dislocation is not proportioned to its breadth. There is a fault extending from Whitley in Northumber land to Greenside and Sandgate in Durham, which has thrown down the strata on the north side one hundred and eighty yards ; this is a comparatively narrow fissure filled with clay. A great basaltic dyke in the same county, which is seventeen yards wide, has only produced a dislocation of twelve yards. The whole series of strata which have been raised above the surface on one side of a fault, have some times entirely disappeared, and the ground on each side of it, is on the same level. See Plate 4. fig. 2, 3. Trap dykes and basalt dykes, are generally hard er than the rocks that they intersect; and when the latter are partly decomposed, often remain, forming vast walls of stone, that rise above the surface ofthe o 2"], [238, "196 BASALTIC DYKES. ground. There are walls of this kind in the coun ties of Northumberland and Durham, running along the country several miles. Dykes also extend into the sea, and form reefs of rocks ; and when they cross the beds of rivers, they form fords, and sometimes hold up the water and occasion cascades, of which there are numerous instances on the river Tees. In the interior of North America, basaltic walls were discovered by Messrs. Lewis and Clerk, of great extent ; the walls were composed of columns of ba salt arranged horizontally, and were at first sup posed to be artificial constructions. Where basaltic dykes are of considerable thickness, the hardness of the stone varies in different parts ; sometimes the inner parts are harder, and sometimes softer, than the outer, the substance in the dyke being divided by seams or partings. This may be distinctly seen at Coaly Hill near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where a large basalt or whin dyke cuts through the coal strata, and rises to the surface. The stone being hard, is quarried for the roads along a line of several hundred yards, forming a deep trench sufficiently wide to admit a cart-road through the quarry, be tween the sides of the dyke. The basalt of the dyke is intersected by fissures, and divided into variously shaped masses. In one part of the dyke it appears to graduate into an in durated ferruginous clay, which is in some places divided into minute well-defined pentagonal prisms. This dyke had charred the coal on each side of it, and rendered it soft and sooty. To use the language of the workman who was quarrying the stone when I visited the place, \" it had burned the coal wherever"], [239, "CLEVELAND BASALT DYKE. 197 it had touched it.\" The same dyke extends from the sea to the western side of the county of Nor thumberland ; its termination in that direction is unknown. The longest mineral dyke that has been traced in England may be called the Cleveland Basalt Dyke: it extends from the western side of Durham to Bewick in Yorkshire; it crosses the riverTeesatthis place, and proceeds in a waving line through the Cleveland Hills in the east riding of Yorkshire to the sea between Scarborough and Whitby. It rises to the surface, and is quarried, in many parts of its course, for stone to lay upon the roads. From Bewick-on-the-Tees it may be traced in an easterly direction, near the villages of Stanton, Newby, Nunthorp and Ay ton. At Langbath-ridge a quarry is worked in it ; it passes south of the remarkable hill called Roseberry Toppin, near Stokesly, and from thence by Lansdale to Kildale ; it may be seen on the surface nearly all the way in the above track. From Kildale it passes to Denbigh Dale end, and through the village of Egton-bridge, and hence over Leace ridge through Gothland, crossing the turnpike road from Whitby to Pickering near the seven mile stone, at a place called Sillow Cross on a high moor. I examined it at this place, where it is quarried for the roads, and is about ten yards wide. From hence it may be traced to Blea Hill near Harwood Dale, in a line towards the sea, near which it is covered with alluvial soil ; but there can be no doubt that it extends into the German Ocean. It is a dark grayish brown basalt which turns brown on exposure to the atmosphere ; it is the principal"], [240, "198 CLEVELAND BASALT DYKE. material for mending the roads in the district called Cleveland. I am indebted to Mr. Bird of Whitby for an account ofthe situations where it may be seen on the surface. He has traced it through Yorkshire and Durham ; in the latter county it cuts through the coal strata. According to Mr. Bird, it crosses the river Tees again, near Tees Force, and, ex panding, forms the great mass of basalt on the western extremity of Durham, taking the columnar form in various parts, particularly at High Cup, a deep circular excavation on the side of Cross Fiell. The specimens ofthe stone shown me by Mr. Bird from this district, are more crystalline and less ho mogeneous than that in Cleveland, being that variety called green-stone, consisting of hornblende and fel spar. The course of this dyke is marked in the Geo logical Map ofEngland, Plate 4. By consulting the large maps of England the course may be distinctly traced : drawing a line in the direction from Cock field in the county of Durham to Bewick-on-the- Tees, and extending the line east and west, it will pass near all the places above mentioned. The Cleveland dyke has been traced in a direct line more than seventy miles. A circumstance at tending this and other extensive dykes, which has not, I believe, been hitherto regarded by geologists, completely invalidates the theory, that dykes were originally open fissures formed by the drying or shrinking in of the rocks. This dyke in its course intersects very different formations, viz. the transi tion or metalliferous limestone, the coal district, and the upper secondary strata of lias and oolite. The different organic remains in these formations, as"], [241, "CLEVELAND BASALT DYKE. 199 well as their position, prove that they were conso lidated at distant periods of time. Indeed the ge ologists who maintain that dykes were formed as before described, are ready to admit the distant \u00e6ras of these formations. The transition, or me talliferous limestone, and the lower strata must have been completely consolidated, long before the upper secondary strata were deposited, and the causes which might dispose the upper strata to shrink in, cannot be supposed to act on the lower rocks. It is also to be remarked that in the lower rocks, si tuated to the west, the breadth of this dyke is more than twenty yards ; but at Sillow Cross, where I measured it, it is not more than ten yards : this dyke must therefore become wider as it descends. It must also have been filled with basalt at the time of its formation, otherwise it would have contained nu merous fragments of the rocks which it intersects. The effects of this basaltic dyke on the different rocks through which it passes are truly remarkable. When it comes in contacj. with the lower or trans ition limestone, it is said to render it more cry stalline, a fact the geological importance of which will be subsequently adverted to. Where it crosses the coal strata, and comes in contact with the seams of coal, the substance ofthe coal is for several feet converted into soot. At a greater distance from the basalt, the coal is redueed to a coke or cinder, which burns without smoke, and with a clear and durable heat. At the distance of fifty feet from the dyke the coal is found in its natural unaltered state. It is particularly remarkable that the roof immediately over the coal is lined with bright crystals of sulphur."], [242, "200 BASALTIC DYKES. In some situations in the same county, the shale in contiguity with basaltic dykes, is converted into flinty slate or jasper, and the sandstone is changed to a brick colour. There is another remarkable basaltic dyke in the same district, which crosses the western extremity of Durham from Allenheads to Burtreeford on the river Tees, hence called the Burtreeford Dyke. It throws down the strata on the west side of it, one hundred and sixty yards. Dykes being generally impervious to water, they obstruct its passage along the porous strata, and occasion it to rise: hence it frequently happens that numerous springs make their appearance along the course of a dyke, by which it may be detected, when there is no other indication of it visible on the surface. Basaltic dykes intersect both primary and secon dary rocks, but they every where present indica tions of their action on the adjacent rocks. At Nigg, near Aberdeen, I examined a basaltic dyke on the coast, which intersects a rock composed of gneiss ; the dyke is about thirty feet in width. Where the basalt is in contact with the gneiss, it becomes nearly compact, and approaches to the character of hornstone ; and the gneiss has a red and burnt appearance, approaching in its nature to porphyry. It is probable that the action of the basalt on the sides of the gneiss rock, had softened it and rendered it more liable to disintegrate than the other parts, for the sea has here made an in dentation inland, forming a deep narrow ravine or bay, with a lofty wall of basalt running through it. The wall of basalt completely divides the bay, and"], [243, "201 CAPS OF BASALT. the sea enters into both parts. It has been before observed, that when basaltic dykes extend into the sea, they form reefs of rocks, and small islands. These basaltic walls, whether rising above the sur face ofthe country, or extending into the sea, serve to mark the destruction of the land; for we are cer tain, that these walls of mineral matter were at one period 'supported on each. _ side by rocks or strata, which they have intersected, but which are now worn away. The Cleveland basalt dyke, it has been stated, cuts through the transition limestone, the coal strata, and the upper secondary strata, comprising a part of the oolite formation. On the northern coast of Ireland, Messrs. Buckland and Conybeare discovered a considerable basaltic dyke, passing through the phalk rocks. In the immediate contiguity of basalt, the chalk on each side of the dyke was rendered highly indurated and crystalline, this effect decreasing as the distance from the dyke increased. The constant occurrence of dykes in basaltic districts gives a high degree of probability to the opinion, that overlying unconformable trap rocks have been erupted in a melted state like lava, and poured over the surface of the ground. Where extensive beds of basalt occur in low situations, there can be little difficulty in admitting this mode of formation ; but the frequent occurrence of beds of basalt, forming isolated caps on distant moun tains, was for a long time considered as opposing completely the hypothesis of the igneous origin of basaltic rocks; a more attentive examination of ba saltic districts has however established the fact, that"], [244, "202 COLUMNAR BASALT. these isolated caps of basalt, are parts of continuous beds which have in remote ages been excavated by valleys, in the same manner as the beds of other rocks which frequently form isolated caps on detached mountains. The capos gritstone on Whin Hill, near Castleton, see Plate 4, affords an illustration of this ; and nothing is more common than to see the same bed of limestone, forming the uppermost stratum or cap ofthe mountains on each side of a valley. The occurrence of thick beds of basalt, divided into regular pentagonal or hexagonal columns, and disposed in ranges of vast extent and height, could not fail to arrest the attention of the most careless observer, and give rise to speculations respecting their origin and formation. Basaltic columns are frequently seen in countries that are the seat of volcanic fires, but they occur also in countries very remote from any known volcanoes; and the opinions of geologists were hence long divided on the sub ject of basaltic rocks, some ascribing to them an aqueous, and others an igneous origin. \u2014 The theo ries respecting their formation will be subsequently adverted to. Few countries in the world present more mag nificent basaltic columnar ranges than the north part of Ireland, and some of the Hebrides : proba bly these are connected under the ocean, and have had the same origin. The Giant's Causeway constitutes a small part of a vast basaltic range, along the north coast of Ire land, in the county of Antrim. The promontory of Fairhead and Borgue, in the same range, are si tuated eight miles from each other : these capes"], [245, "GIANT'S CAUSEWAY. 203 consist of various ranges of pillars and horizontal strata, which rise from the sea to the height of five hundred feet ; from their abruptness they are very conspicuous, and form a pile of natural architecture, in which the regularity and symmetry of art, are united with the wild grandeur and magnificence of nature. Many of the columns in the ranges at Fairhead are one hundred and fifty feet in height, and five feet in breadth. At the base along the shore is a wild waste of rocky fragments, which have fallen from the cliffs. Immense masses that have withstood the force of the shock lie in groups, resembling the ruins of enormous castles. At the Giant's Causeway the columns rarely exceed one foot in breadth, and thirty feet in height : they are sharply defined, and the columns are divided into smaller blocks, or prisms of one foot or more in length, which fit neatly into each other, like a ball and socket. The basalt is close grained, but the upper joint is cellular. The columns are most fre quently formed with five or six sides; but some have seven or eight, and others not more than three. Beds of basalt that are not columnar, in some situa tions lie over, and also under the columns. The basalt in these beds is cellular, and contains zeolites in its cavities. The columns at Fairhead are not articulated like those at the Giant's Causeway ; but the blocks, which are of great length in each co lumn, lie flat on each other. Basalt appears to extend on the coast and inland about forty miles in length, and twenty in breadth. A full and perspicuous account of the geology of"], [246, "204 giant's causeway. this part of Ireland, is given by Messrs. Buckland and Conybeare in the 4th volume of the Geological Transactions. It appears that this basaltic range rests upon lias limestone containing marine shells and ammonites ; the basalt also enters chalk-rocks, which are much broken by it, and in one part a considerable mass of chalk is completely enveloped in basalt. The effect of a basaltic dyke in crystal lizing the chalk on each side of it, has already been mentioned. Former observers, unacquainted with the nature ofthe rock on which the basaltic ranges ofthe Giant's Causeway rest, have mistaken it for basalt; it is a dark coloured highly indurated lime stone, and as it contains shells and other organic remains, these remains were erroneously supposed to prove the marine origin of basalt. The basaltic columns of the Island of Staffa are too well known to require a description ; but, ac cording to Dr. MacCulIoch, the columns which form the lofty promontory called the Scuir of Egg, an other of the Hebrides, exceed in grandeur and in picturesque effect those of Staffa : they are formed of black pitchstone, containing crystals of glossy fel spar. \" The promontory rests on a bed of compact gray limestone, approaching to a stone marie. This bed, which is three or four feet thick, rests on a still lower bed of hard reddish stone. Masses of bitu minized wood, penetrated with carbonate of lime, are found in the marie stratum not at all flattened. Portions of trunks of trees, retaining their original shape, but petrified (silicified), are found in the same stratum ; the rifts are filled with chalcedony, ap-"], [247, "cader idris. 205 proaching in aspect to semi-opal. The columns on this island are both perpendicular and inclined, and some of them are bent or curved.\" In various parts of Scotland and the Hebrides, the tendency to a columnar arrangement in the ba saltic rocks may be distinctly seen : it is obscurely developed in the basalt of Arthur's Seat near Edin burgh. The basalt of this hill appears identical with some of the volcanic mountains I examined in Auvergne, particularly near the summit of Mont adoux, a mountain near Clermont. In England the columnar structure of some ofthe basaltic and trap rocks is observable in the northern counties, particularly on the banks of the river Tees, and at Swarthfell near Ulswater. In some of the basaltic hills near Dudley, the columnar structure is developed, but the columns are not separated and well defined. Prismatic blocks of sienite are scat tered over a hill of sienite called Markfield Knowl, at Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire. Columns of porphyritic trap or greenstone occur in groups, on the northern side of Cader Idris, a mountain in Merionethshire. One of these colum nar groups is represented Plate 5. fig. I. the outline of the columns was taken with a camera lucida by Henry Struts, Esq. of Derby, and cannot fail to be correct; the figure is introduced, to show the rela tive magnitude of the columns. Rocks of trap and basalt, both in solid beds and also arranged in co lumns like those of Staffa, were observed by Sir G. Mackenzie on the coast of Iceland, and also in the interior; the lower parts of the beds and columns contained scori\u00e6 and slags, and empty cavities. A"], [248, "206 BASALT IN ICELAND. successive range of beds of basalt was also observed alternating with beds of tufa, the lower parts of which presented the same appearance of the action of fire. From the situation of these rocks, and from the existence of submarine volcanoes near Iceland, Sir G. Mackenzie conceives that these beds of basalt were formed under the sea by the ejection of lava, which flowing over the moist submarine ground, would confine a portion of water beneath the melted mass : this water would be converted into elastic vapour, or steam, which would endeavour to expand ; but where the superincumbent pressure ofthe ocean, or the tenacity ofthe lava, prevented its escape, it would be compressed, and form cavi ties, or air bubbles, at the bottom of the melted mass. In other instances, where the fluidity of the lava permitted the steam from below to escape through it, the mass would be compact, and form solid basalt, or greenstone. It might sometimes happen that water would be inclosed in the cavi ties of the mass, which is found to be the case in some basalt rocks. Thus, according to the different circumstances of pressure from the depth of the ocean, and from the tenacity of the melted mass, he supposes that porous and vesicular lava, or compact basalt, might be formed from the same eruption ; or the mass might be porous below and compact above. As Iceland is at present the seat of active volca noes, and as submarine volcanoes are forming rocks near the shores of that island, Sir George Macken zie's explanation of the causes which have pro-"], [249, "BASALT IN AUVERGNE. 207 duced the various appearances in the basaltic ranges of that island, seems highly probable. In Sicily the connection of basaltic with volcanic rocks has been clearly established by Ferrara, professor of Natural Philosophy at Catania. In the vicinity of Clermont Ferrand in Auvergne, a thick bed of basalt has once covered an extensive tract of country ; it rests upon a bed of volcanic tufa, and the latter frequently covers beds of fresh water limestone. This bed of basalt and the sub jacent tufa and limestone, have evidently been fur rowed and excavated by the same causes which have excavated valleys in other parts ofthe world; hence the basalt occurs forming isolated caps on many of the mountains. In some parts a gradation may be traced in the same bed from a compact ba salt, similar to that of Arthur's Seat near Edinburgh, to porous basalt approaching more or less to the state of scoriaceous lava. But the basalt of this country belongs evidently to volcanic products, and will be described in the chapter on volcanoes. It may be proper to remark, that as the basalt of Au vergne covers beds of freshwater limestone, which belong to the tertiary strata, its age is evidently posterior to that formation of limestone, which is regarded as the most recent. Basalt sometimes presents a globular structure, globes of hard basalt being imbedded in a mass of basalt of a softer kind. Wacke or earthy basalt has frequently a greenish or reddish brown colour ; it often contains cavities which are generally filled with nodules of agate, or with zeolite or calcareous spar. The agates are"], [250, "208 CORALLITE IN BASALT. composed of concentric layers, and have apparently been formed by siliceous infiltration depositing successive coats within each other, until the cavity is filled up. Basaltic rocks of this kind are called amygdaloids. The Hill of Kinoul, In the vicinity of Perth, is formed of basaltic amygdaloid containing agate nodules in great abundance, of various dimen sions and beautifully striped. At Woodford Bridge, in Gloucestershire, there is a low rock ofamygda loidal wacke, which is much intermixed with green earth, and has in some parts a saponaceous feel ; the agates which it contains are decomposing, and the intense concentric layers are separated from each other, and present the appearance of edges of folded paper, with small interstices between each. I examined this singular rock in 1816 ; it was then quarried for stone to mend the roads. In some parts of the rocks I found masses of corallite of considerable size enveloped in the basaltic amygda loid. I found also in this rock well defined groups of prehnite, which was not then known to be an English mineral : it has since been discovered in the basalt of Staffordshire. The occurrence of organic remains enveloped in basalt, of which there are various instances, may admit of an easy explanation, if we allow that ba salt has once flowed like lava at the bottom of the ocean. Modern lavas often envelop bones and other substances that they meet with in their course. Imbedded interstratified basalt or trap is some times found alternating with rocks ofundoubted ma rineorigin. In Derbyshirethere arethreebedsof ba-"], [251, "209 SANDSTONE STRATA BROKEN BY BASALT. saltic amygdaloid separated by thick beds of trans ition limestone. Mr. Westgarth Forster has de scribed an enormous bed of basalt in Northumber land and Durham, called the great Whinstone sill, placed between regular strata of limestone and grit stone ; this bed varies in thickness from twelve to sixty yards. Other instances might be cited of basal tic beds inter-posed between regular strata, but fre quently the strata are broken and disturbed in the vicinity of the basaltic beds. At Salisbury Craggs near Edinburgh, there is an instance of a bed of sandstone apparently broken by its contiguity to traj) ; the sandstone near its contact with the trap, is converted into a substance approaching to jasper. A very interesting account is given by Dr. Mac- Culloch of the partial interposition of beds of trap, in strata of sandstone, on the coast of Scotland, where the trap may sometimes be seen forming apparently regular beds between strata of sand stone, and suddenly rising through part of the upper strata, and forming other beds above. A general idea of this mode of interposition is represented Plate 3. fig. 3. where the strata under a bed of co lumnar basalt, are intersected vertically by a dyke, and laterally by beds of basalt of limited extent. In such cases we may trace the effect of a disturbing force, which intruded the basalt in a melted or softened state between strata of sandstone. The beds of Derbyshire toadstone, and the great Whinstone sill in Northumberland and Durham, may have been formed by repeated eruptions of lava over the bed of the ocean ; or, what is less pro bable, they may have been intruded long after the p"], [252, "210 ALTERNATION OF BASALT OR LAVA formation ofthe strata, wilh which they are at pre sent associated It has been generally believed, that the veins of lead ore in Derbyshire, which pass through the beds of limestone, are entirely cut off by the toad stone ; and if this could be proved, it would favour the opinion, that the beds of toadstone had been intruded between the beds of limestone, after the formation of the metallic veins. In some instances, however, the veins of lead ore do pass into the toad stone, and are rich in ore. It is now even doubted whether all the veins do not pass through the beds of toadstone,- though they may become very narrow or yield no ore when in the latter rock. The in formation which I could collect from the most intel ligent miners, when I was last in that county, still leaves the question undecided. Plate 4. fig. 5. represents the beds of limestone b. b. b. separated by beds of toadstone e. e. In this section the veins are represented as cut through by the toadstone : if this be really the fact, it will, as before stated, favour the opinion that they were in truded subsequent to the formation ofthe veins. The interesting observations of Dr. Daubeny, in his Sketch of the Geology of Sicily, seem clearly to ascertain, that beds of amygdaloidal trap, alternating with beds of limestone, have, in that island at least, been formed by successive currents of lava flowing over the bed ofthe sea, at intervals of time so di stant, as to allow the deposition or formation of a bed of limestone over each current of lava. A con siderable district near Lentini, on the southern side of Mount \u00c6tna, and also a part of the island near"], [253, "WITH LIMESTONE. 211 Cape Passero, are composed of alternating beds of lava, with tertiary limestone abounding with organic remains of madreporites, nummulites, cerithea, and the remarkable fossil called the Hippurite. Santa Venera, the loftiest mountain in the south ofthe island, is capped with cellular lava; beneath it is a bed of limestone with minute shells; at a lower level towards Lentini, there is a second bed of volcanic matter similar to the first; and two other similar alternations of beds of limestone and lava, occur still lower down. Dr. Daubeny says that the cellular and semivitreous aspect of many ofthe volcanic beds associated with the beds of limestone, precludes all doubt respecting the manner of their formation : the character of other portions present strong analogies to rocks of the trap family; \"they are compact, and have a stony fracture; they con tain crystals of olivine, and the cavities are filled with calcareous spar or zeolites, like the amygda loids of more ancient strata ; and in some of the beds, a tendency to a columnar arrangement is discernible.\" This account of Dr. Daubeny's affords addi tional proof of the close connection of ancient vol canic rocks with trap rocks, \u2014 may wenotadd, oftheir perfect identity : it is beside highly illustrative of the alternation of the beds of basaltic amygdaloid in Derbyshire, with beds of limestone. But in both instances, we must admit that the beds were formed under the ocean, before the present islands and continents had emerged from the watery abyss. The disturbances and contortions of some ofthe lower beds of transition limestone, in the vicinity of p 2"], [254, "212 EXPERIMENTS trap rocks, were mentioned in Chap. VII. In such instances, though frequently no visible connection between the rocks of trap and limestone can be traced on the surface, there can be little doubt that such connection exists. The singularly bent lime stone beds at Wren's Nest Hill near Dudley, are at a considerable distance from the nearest basaltic hill ; but I observed in the town of Dudley, where a well was sinking, that the stone thrown out, was granular basalt intermixed with calcareous spar. Some species of trap rocks, and particularly the softer kinds of basalt, decompose rapidly, and form productive soils and marie. I am inclined to be lieve, that some of the most fertile soils in England were formed by an intermixture with decomposed basaltic rocks. What has been called basaltic tufa, is a volcanic substance, and will be described among volcanic products. Some of the trap rocks, parti cularly the porphyritic traps, are metalliferous; but it is rarely the case with any of the British trap rocks, and it has before been stated, that the veins of lead ore in Derbyshire, are either cut off by beds of basalt, or generally cease to yield ore when pass ing through basalt. Having described the principal phenomena at tending trap rocks, whether occurring in dykes, in unconformable masses, or interstratified with other rocks, it may be proper to mention certain experi ments that have been made, to elucidate the forma tion of basaltic rocks. All trap rocks are fusible, and most of them form a blackish-green glass after melting : hence it was inferred, that trap rocks had never been in a state of fusion ; for if they had, they"], [255, "ON BASALT. 213 would have been rendered vitreous. Sir James Hall, however, reflecting on the long period of re- frigeration that vast masses of melted rock would necessarily require before they were cooled to the common temperature of the earth, was induced to make experiments on lava and basalt; from which it was ascertained, that if a small portion of liquid lava were suddenly cooled, it formed a black glass, as was well known to be the case with basalt, but if the process of cooling were slow, both melted lava and basalt became stone. When the glass which had been formed by sudden cooling was melted again, and suffered to cool very gradually, it lost its vitreous character, and was converted into a substance resembling basalt. Mr. Gregory Watt made some experiments on the fusion and refrigera- tion of basalt, in one of his father's furnaces, which throws much additional light on the formation of the \"lobular and columnar structure of basaltic rocks. He fused seven hundred weight of the Dud- ley basalt called Rowley ragg, and kept it in the furnace several days after the fire was reduced. It melted into a dark-coloored glass with less heat than was necessary to melt the same quantity of pig-iron. In this glass, small globules were formed, which afterwards disappeared ; and as the cooling pro- ceeded, the mass was changed from a vitreous to a stony substance: other globes were again formed within the stony mass, which continued to enlarge until their sides touched and pressed against each other, by which pressure the globes formed poly gonal prisms. If part of the mass were cooled be fore the globular structure was destroyed, these"], [256, "214 EXPERIMENTS OF SIR JAMES HALL. globes were harder than the surrounding stone, and broke in concentric layers. In this manner the balls of basalt and porphyry which fall out of de composing rocks were probably formed; they de rived their superior hardness from the crystalline arrangement ofthe particles when in a melted state. When these globes were enlarged by a continuation of the same process, they might press on each other, and form prisms. The upper prisms pressing by their weight upon the lower, might form concavities or sockets, into which they would sink, and remain jointed together or articulated. Such is frequently the structure of basaltic columns. Another experiment, made by Sir James Hall, on the crystallization of common limestone by heat, and its conversion into marble, tends to elucidate the effects produced by basaltic rocks, on limestone and chalk before mentioned. Dr. Hutton had ad vanced the opinion, that beds of limestone were formed ofthe shells and exuvi\u00e6 of marine animals, which had been melted by central fire, and cry stallized. The first part of this theory respecting the entire formation of calcareous rocks from animal remains, it is not necessary to discuss at present : that a considerable portion of many limestone rocks were so formed, cannot be denied. It was however objected to this theory, that the well-known action of fire on limestone rocks would expel the fixed air, and render them soft and pulverulent. To this objection it was replied, that as the action of central heat on beds of marine shells took place under the ocean, the pressure of the water would prevent the escape ofthe fixed air, and would probably render"], [257, "EXPERIMENTS OF SIR JAMES HALL. 215 the calcareous earth more fusible. This answer was regarded as a mere hypothesis for some time, but Sir James Hall determined to try its validity by ex periments. Having calculated the resistance which a column of water fifteen hundred feet, or any given depth, would present to the escape of fixed air, he inclosed a quantity of powdered chalk in a gun barrel, and confined it in such a manner as to pre sent an equal degree of resistance. He subjected the powdered chalk, thus confined for some time, to the action of a furnace; it was then drawn out and cooled, and was found converted into crystalline limestone or marble; and in one instance, where the chalk in closed a shell, the shell had acquired a crystalline texture, without losing its form. Hence in situations where chalk or earthy limestone are found to have a crystalline texture, when in contiguity with trap rocks, we may with a high degree of probability infer, that the limestone had been fused by the trap. A recapitulation of the facts and experiments which prove the igneous origin of trap rocks, would afford a mass of evidence which might convince the most sceptical inquirer; but such a recapitulation is needless, as in many situations undoubted currents of lava pass into trap rocks, and we have ocular de monstration of the fact. The reason why geologists were so long opposed to the igneous origin of basaltic rocks, may partly be explained by the attachment to received theories, and partly by the reluctance to admit a condition of our planet, so remote from present experience. It was thought an ample claim on our credulity, when we were required to believe, that all the habitable parts"], [258, "216 WERNERS THEORY. of the globe had been for ag-es submerged in the ocean, without requiring the further belief, that countries now remote from active volcanoes, had been repeatedly subject to the agency of subter ranean fire. Yet both these positions must be granted, if we will allow a legitimate induction from established facts. The advocates of the aqueous origin of basaltic rocks, while they advanced theories which made claims upon our faith, equally unsupported by pre sent experience, failed entirely in their attempts to explain the causes of existing phenomena in a satis factory manner. The theory of Werner was for some time zealously supported, and particularly the least tenable part of it, \u2014 the formation of basaltic rocks by a second rising of the ocean, which depo sited them on the summits of elevated mountains. \u2014 It may be proper to give a brief account of this part of the Wernerian system, before it entirely sinks into oblivion. According to the theory of Werner, all the super ficial parts of the globe were once in a state of aqueous solution, from which the materials were at first separated by chemical deposition in a crystalline state, and formed a thick mass of granite round the globe. Upon granite, the primary rocks were suc cessively deposited, forming layers over each other like the coats of an onion. Over these again were laid the transition rocks; and next, the earthy strati fied rocks. Each of these layers was supposed to encircle the globe, or to be an universal formation. While this process was going on, the waters were gradually retiring and became turbid : hence the"], [259, "WERNER'S THEORY. 217 materials which they deposited to form the upper strata, were more earthy than those of the primary rocks ; they were also intermixt with fragments of the rocks previously formed. According to this system, mouutains and valleys were caused by the original inequality of the nucleus of the earth. So far the parts of Werner's theory are consistent; and we have a world ready made, in which every thing might be supposed to remain quiet ; but \u2014 non sic Fata sinunt ; \u2014 Neptune, ashamed of his late retreat, and indignant at his confinement in such narrow limits, calls the infernal deities to his assistance, and rising in his might, once more takes possession of the globe. He covers it with the depurgations of his turbid waves : but again he is compelled slowly and reluctantly to retire from the field, leaving be hind him the basaltic rocks, the monuments of his triumph and his shame. \u2014 Such is in substance the theory of Werner respecting the origin of all the superincumbent rocks of basalt and trap. They are also, according to this theory, universal formations. It is scarcely possible for the human mind to invent a system more repugnant to existing facts. Were basaltic rocks deposited from a solution which cover ed the globe after the formation of secondary strata, as Werner supposes, every part of the dry land and every valley must have been incrusted or filled with basalt, \u2014 it would be the prevailing rock of every dis trict. On the contrary, basalt exists only in par ticular situations, forming dykes, and overlying masses or beds of limited extent: nor do fragments of basalt occur in any quantity to warrant the belief that it was ever formed universally over the globe :"], [260, "218 AGE OF TRAP ROCKS. and what is here said of basalt, applies equally to all unconformable rocks of porphyry, and the other trap rocks. Nothing but the obscure language in which this doctrine of Werner was advanced, could have prevented its absurdity from being instantly per ceived and acknowledged. ,-j _ . With respect to the relative age of trap rocks, it is evident that if they are of igneous origin, they may have been formed at any period. We have cer tain indications that basaltic rocks were formed at different epochs ; some of the basaltic dykes which cut through the coal strata in the northern counties, do not enter the magnesian limestone that covers the coal strata. Hence it is clear, that such basaltic dykes were formed before the magnesian limestone was deposited; while the Cleveland basalt dyke passes through many ofthe upper secondary strata, above the magnesian limestone, and is therefore of posterior formation to that rock. Observations. The unconformable porphyritic and basaltic rocks, which are the subject of this chapter, cannot be classed according to their relative ages, as they occur with all the other classes of rock. From this circumstance, the authorhas, on reconsideration, been induced to deviate somewhat from the arraugement proposed in ChapterL, and to place the unconformable massive rocks after the primary, transition, and lower secondary rocks, which cover each other conformably. Between the deposition of the lower secondary and the upper secondary rocks, there appears to have been a considerable pause or interval, during which the beds of the lower rocks were elevated, before the upper were deposited upon them unconformably. Hence it was thought, that the de scription of the unconformable massive rocks might properly be"], [261, "219 AGE OF TRAP ROCKS. placed between that of the lower, and the upper secondary : and should any of my readers be disposed to deem the position of this chapter unconformable with the order first proposed, let them recollect, that I had unconformable subjects to treat of. In the brief sketch of the different classes of rocks given in the first chapter, it was not thought desirable to perplex the learner, or disturb the regular succession of the different classes of rock, by introducing those which occur among them all unconformably. By this deviation from the original arrangement, it will be necessary to make the upper secondary strata a class distinctfrom the lower secondary ; aud the difference between them is so well marked and definite, that they may properly be regarded as forming two classes. The alteration here mentioned, amounts however to nothing more than a mere difference iu the collocation of the classes."], [262, "220 CHAPTER X. A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW OF CERTAIN GEOLO- GICAL FACTS AND INFERENCES STATED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS. BEFORE we proceed to the Upper Secondary Rocks, it may be useful to review some of the lead ing facts stated in the preceding chapters, and to notice certain inquiries, which may naturally pre sent themselves to the mind of the geological stu dent. It appears from an examination of the crust ofthe globe, wherever it has been scientifically ex plored, that there is an order of succession or super position in the rocks of every country, which may often be traced over a considerable extent; and that in countries very remote from each other, an ap proximation to the same order is observable, except in one class of rocks which are obtruded irregularly, and cover other rocks without any determinate order of succession, as described in the last chapter. It not unfrequently happens, that in a series of rocks which occur in two distant districts, some members ofthe series may be wanting in one, which we find in the other; but still the order of those rocks which remain will be the same in both. It is easy to con ceive that the cause or causes, whatever they may be, which have formed certain rocks, have been limited in the extent of their action, as we know to be frequently the case on a smaller scale, where a"], [263, "RETROSPECTIVE VIEW, &C. 221 stratum of sandstone, &c. after preserving its regu lar thickness for several miles, becomes gradually narrower, till at length, in the language of the miner, it wedges out, and the stratum above and beneath come in immediate contact. In other instances, the rock which is interposed between two well known and identical rocks in distant districts, is not the same in both : this may be frequently observed among the upper secondary strata, which will next be described. In such cases, the different rocks that occur in the same geological position have been called equivalents of each other. An instance men tioned in a preceding chapter, may serve to explain what is meant by a geological equivalent. In the beds of transition limestone at Llanymynal, which are very regularly stratified, one stratum of the best limestone suddenly terminates, and its place is supplied by a bed of marie of equal thickness; in the same manner as we might suppose part of a course of bricks to be taken out of a wall, and its place filled up with clay ; the clay would be the equivalent of the course of bricks. In many of the lower conformable rocks, there is a frequent tendency to reproduction in the upper parts of the series : thus, though the regular order of succession may he granite, gneiss, mica-slate, and slate (the clay-slate of Werner), we often find beds of granite among gneiss and mica-slate, and sometimes even in slate. When, however, we con sider, that the chemical composition of all these rocks is very nearly the same; that silex forms on the average three-fourths of their constituent parts, and alumineaboutone-sixth or one-eighth, \u2014 the pro-"], [264, "222 GRANITE MOUNTAINS OF ENGLAND portions of the remaining parts cannot greatly affect the condition of the mass ; and it is to the circum stances, (whatever they may be,) which have occa sioned a more or less rapid consolidation ot the parts, that we ought, probably, to attribute the formation of granite in one part ofa mountain, and of gneiss, mica-slate, or slate in another, and the reappearance of granite above the latter rocks. An inquiry na turally suggests itself, on observing that the order of succession in rocks is not invariably the same in distant countries ; Are the similar rock formations in distant parts of the world cotemporaneous ? or were rocks of different classes forming at the same period ? Is the granite of England for instance, more or less ancient than the granite ofthe Alps ? Or, are the secondary strata of one country, as old as the primitive rocks of another ? Were it not for the organic remains in different rocks, we could not (as Cuvier has well observed,) be certain that all rock formations were not cotem poraneous. With respect to those rocks which contain no organic remains, and under which there are no oilier beds containing organic remains, we must grant that they may be cotemporaneous, or they may have been formed at different and distant epochs. The beds of granite which are nearly vertical in mountain ranges, must have acquired a considerable degree of solidity, before the period when the beds were raised: but if we date their age from the epoch of their elevation, we shall be ob liged to admit the different ages of granite moun tains, and that the granite of Charnwood Forest is more ancient than that of the Alps. Of this we"], [265, "223 MORE ANCIENT THAN THE ALPS. have as direct proof as we could possibly require. In the Alps, the beds of the upper secondary strata, analogous to our magnesian limestone, lias, and oolite, are raised into nearly a vertical position con formable to that of the beds of granite, and they must all have been elevated at the same time. \u2014 See Plate2. fig. 3. where the relative situation ofthe beds of upper secondary limestone is represented, a. a. At Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, very highly inclined beds of granitic and slate rocks are covered with horizontal beds of the upper se condary strata, analogous to those in the Alps. \u2014 See Plate 2. fig. 4. a. a. Now it is evident that the gra nitic and slate rocks were raised before the hori zontal strata were deposited upon them. Hence we attain the knowledge of an interesting fact in the natural history of our island ; \u2014 its low ranges of pri mitive or transition hills are more ancient than the majestic mountains of Switzerland and Savoy : nor can this conclusion be invalidated, unless we admit what would be contrary to analogy, that secondary strata, possessing the same geological relations and the same organic remains, were formed at differ ent epochs. I have cited the Charnwood Forest hills, because there the proof is more direct and palpable than at the Malvern Hills or elsewhere; for the horizontal upper secondary strata, may be seen resting immediately on highly inclined beds of gra nitic and schistose rocks. The horizontal beds resting ou the Charnwood Forest granite and slate, are composed of sand stone, a part of the red marie and sandstone forma tion ; and at a little distance the sandstone is cover-"], [266, "224 GRANITE MOUNTAINS OF ENGLAND ed by strata of lias limestone, b. b. which determine its relative age. In some parts the sandstone strata also cover the coal strata, and the latter rise very abruptly as they approach the granite in the north. At the Vosges mountains in France, the same red marie and sandstone, associated with lias covers the granite and coal strata unconformably. When M. Daubuisson published his Traite de Geognosie in 1819, he asserted, that the beds of granite in the Alps were raised into their present vertical or highly inclined position soon after their original formation. I visited the Alps in the two following years, and the appearances presented by the secondary strata compelled me to draw a very different inference respecting the period when the beds of granite were elevated, which I stated in the second volume of my Travels, published in 1823. \"One important fact may be deduced from these elevated beds of pudding-stone, sandstone, and other strata, comparatively modern, ranging con formably with beds of granite and gneiss ; namely, That the beds of granite did not acquire their ele vated position till after the formation of the second ary strata. In England, the elevation of the beds of granite was anterior to the deposition of the up per strata, consisting of magnesian limestone, lias limestone, oolite, chalk, and the intervening sand stones ; for all these strata lie nearly flat over the edges ofthe inclined understrata. On the contrary, in Savoy, strata of similar formations occur nearly vertical, and frequently conformable to the range and dip of the granitic formations. These facts would prove, that the causes which have elevated"], [267, "MORE ANCIENT THAN THE ALPS. 225 granite, have acted at different epochs on various parts of the globe, unless we are prepared to admit that similar calcareous formations, containing simi lar organic remains, were not cotemporaneous in different countries.\" In the latter part of the same volume I further stated, that as some of the strata on the Diableret mountains in the Vallais contain, at the height of seven thousand feet, fossils similar to those of the tertiary strata in the Paris Basin, it was more rea sonable to believe that they had been raised since their deposition, than that freshwater formations had covered any part of the earth at such a vast elevation \u25a0 and hence we may infer, that the epoch when the granite of the Alps was raised, is compa ratively recent*. It may be said that geologists formerly admitted the different ages of granite ; by this they gene rally meant to apply the term Newer Granite, to the beds of granite which occur in gneiss or mica slate, which being above the great formations of granite, may perhaps be regarded as more recent. Some geologists have indeed attempted to discover a difference in the age of different granites which they regard as primary ; but they have not clearly informed us whether they admit the existence of an older primitive granite, under the newer. The a. - * Since the author published his opinion, in 1823, respecting the recent elevation of the Alps, founded on an attentive exami nation of the structure of the Pennine and Bernese Alps; M.Von Buch, M.L. Elie de Beaumont, and M . Andre de Luc, of Geneva, have advanced similar opinions, and stated that the elevation of those mountains tookplace after the formation ofthe tertiary strata. Q"], [268, "226 ON COTEMPORANEOUS tempts which have been made to distinguish the newer and older primitive granites by their mineral characters appear so nugatory, that I feel much sur prise that M. Humboldt, a geologist to whom science owes so much, should have lent the sanction of his authority to such a useless labour. In every coun try, granite, under whatever mode it may present itself, whether large or small grained, or slaty, if it be the lowest rock that can be observed, and if it be covered by either gneiss, mica-slate, or slate, may be regarded as the primitive foundation rock of that country, if there be any use in preserving the term : its relative age, compared with that of other countries, can only be determined by the posi tion of the rocks that rest upon it. With respect to the identity of age, or what is pedantically named the synchronism of rock forma tions in distant countries, there can be little hesita tion in admitting it, where the association with other rock formations is similar in both countries, and particularly where a similarity of mineral cha racter is observable. It will not be denied that the chalk and oolite in Yorkshire, were cotempo raneous with certain parts of the chalk and oolite formations in the southern and western counties. In the same manner, we may admit that the chalk, and oolite, and lias, on the opposite side of the Channel, in France, are cotemporaneous with similar forma tions in England, with which they preserve an identity of mineralogical and zoological characters. Having once traced these formations to the North of France, we may admit their identity with similar formations, preserving the same identity of character"], [269, "ROCK FORMATIONS. 227 through many ofthe inland departments of France, and to the Salins at the foot ofthe Jura range. Over so large an extent of country we may expect to find, as we do in distant districts in England, that certain parts of a series which occur in a certain formation in one place, are wanting in another. In France, some beds occur, in the lias for instance, which have not hitherto been found in Great Bri tain : but making allowance for such partial varia tions, we cannot hesitate to admit the identity of the formations in both countries, and also their identity of age. When we enter the Jura, or the great calcareous ranges of the Alps, the enormous thickness of the beds, which are frequently inac cessible, and the indurated and subcrystalline tex ture which they often assume, present considerable difficulties, when we attempt to identify them with well known formations. Much confusion and con trariety may be observed in the classification of these rocks by different geologists : but this has partly arisen from the observers notbeingthoroughly acquainted with the formations with which they were to make the comparison, and partly from the vague and contradictory use of the terms Alpine limestone (calcaire Alpin), and Jura limestone (cal caire de Jura). There is, however, in some parts of these mountains, both an identity of mineral, and of zoological characters, with some of the formations in the upper secondary strata in En gland. A thick bed of blue lias filled with the Gryph\u00e6a arcuata, in the mountains on the lake of Annecy, and fragments of oolite, like that of Glou cestershire, from the top of Mont Grenier, near Q2"], [270, "228 ORGANIZATION OF ANIMALS Chamberry, left me no doubt of the identity of the formations of England, France, and Savoy; and no reason can be assigned, which might lead us to infer that the similar formations in each country were not cotemporaneous. With respect to very remote countries, or the countries in opposite hemispheres, we have as yet few data to determine whether there be an identity of fossil remains, which can identify formations that may appear analogous, when they occur in very different latitudes, and under very different degrees of temperature. There is another circumstance, independent of climate or remote distance, that may have occa sioned a change in the genera, and even in the orders and classes of animals, whose remains are found in similar strata. The ocean may have been much deeper in one part, than in another not very remote, and the deepest bed of the ocean might support genera of pelagian animals* ; while a more shallowadjacent part, might be tenanted by different genera, and even different orders and classes of animals, whose organization fitted them for moving nearer the surface of the water. The transition strata were probably formed under a great depth of the sea: and the animals that possessed the power of locomotion in an eminent degree, whose remains are found in those strata, are not numerous; these are the chambered univalve Molusc\u00e6. Their shells are mostly cylindrical or conical, divided into differ ent cells, withatubeorsiphunculus passing through * Pelagian animals, so called by naturalists because they live in deep seas."], [271, "229 LIVING IN DEEP SEAS. each cell, by which they were enabled to exhaust the water, and rise to the surface from immense depths. The shells of these animals did not form an outer covering, but were partly enveloped in their bodies ; they had heads surrounded by feelers and large eyes, their beaks were like those of theparrot*. The feelers which surrounded their heads, served them for seizing their prey, and for swimming and walking at the bottom of the sea ; they swam with their heads behind them, and when they walked their heads were downward. There are only two known genera of chambered animals of this class inhabiting the present seas ; the Nautilus, and the Spirula, \u2014 their shells are spiral : the greatest num ber of chambered fossil shells found in the upper se condary strata are also spiral, and are well known, as Ammonites and Nautilites. It is probable that the animals that had straight chambered shells, possess ed greater facility of rising to the surface than the spiral ones, and accordingly we find them chiefly in the oldest and lowest formations. The animals of this class having heads and various senses, seem to rank high in the scale of sentient organic beings ; * The animals of this Order, to which Cuvier has given the name of Cephalopodes, from their feelers, which serve as feet, being attached to their heads, comprise several genera, as the Sepia or scuttle-fish, the calmar, &c. but these animals have no shells. There are only two known living species of Cephalo podes with chambered shells. The Argonauta, common in the Mediterranean, has an open unchambered shell. There are nu merous minute microscopic chambered shells found in the pre sent seas, but according to Cuvier the living animal has never yet been observed. \u2014 Regne Animal, torn. ii. p. 367."], [272, "230 ORGANIZATION OF ANIMALS but they are not numerous till we rise into the up per secondary strata above the coal formation. Very few spiral unchambered shells occur in the transi tion rocks ; for these animals crawl on their bellies like the snail, and do not seem fitted to live in deep water, unless like the Helix Janthina, which nearly resembles the snail and lives in the Southern Ocean, they had little appendages like bladders, which en abled them to rise to the surface*.

Neither metallic veins nor beds deserving notice, except of iron ores, occur in this class of rocks, nor do they afford any of the rare species of crystallized minerals. Rock-salt and gypsum are the most valuable minerals found in the upper secondary strata, and it is from them that all the important salt-springs issue. Some of the rocks in this class yield useful materials for archi tecture, but the stone is too generally soft and pe rishable. To the rocks of this class, Werner gave the name of floetz or flat rocks, because in the northern parts of Europe they are generally ar ranged nearly in horizontal strata ; but this cha racter is altogether inapplicable to the upper secon dary strata in the outer ranges of the Alps, and in the Jura chain, where they may be observed bent in every possible direction, and sometimes nearly vertical. It has been stated in the preceding chapters, that the coal strata, which are interposed between the transition rocks and the upper secondary strata, contain almost exclusively the organic remains of vegetables; while the fossils in the lower or transi tion class, belong almost exclusively to marine ani mals. Another great change appears to have taken place in the condition of our planet after the depo sition of the coal strata, for the upper secondary strata contain principally the remains of marine animals. It is in the strata belonging to this class, that the remains of vertebrated animals are first distinctly observed. Among these we find the"], [276, "234 FOSSIL CROCODILES IN bones of the mighty monsters of an ancient creation, \u2014 monsters whose extraordinary forms are still more astonishing than their immense magnitude. Some of these animals, ofthe saurian or lizard order, at tained the length of forty feet or more, and appear, from the structure of the teeth and the organs of motion, to have united to the voracity of the croco dile, the power of darting through the water on their prey with inconceivable rapidity. Others, whose heads and bodies preserved the form of saurian ani mals, had necks so long, that when extended out of the water they musthave resembled immense hydras. These animals had paddles in the place of feet, to ac celerate their motion through water. Again, other large animals of this order had feet like those ofthe crocodile, and were probably amphibious : indeed the occurrence of large fossil vegetable stems in the same strata, proves that there was dry land in the vicinity. It further appears, from the recent researches of Cuvier, that some of the lizard-shaped animals had wings, and realized the fabulous creations of the poet \u2014 they were flying dragons. The remains ofthe large saurian animals are more frequent in the middle part of the series, in the strata of this class, than in the upper or lower part ; indeed, in the lowest members of this series they have not yet been discovered. It is truly remarkable, that throughout the whole series of the upper secondary strata, no bones of mammiferous land quadrupeds have yet been found, unless the strata at Stonesfield, present a solitary exception. Lignite or wood-coal, and remains of vegetables,"], [277, "THE ENGLISH STRATA. 235 occur in some of the formations in this class, and also river shells. In England, the order of succession of the upper secondary rocks may be more distinctly ascertained than in any other country that has yet been exa mined. I shall therefore describe them as they occur in our own country, with references to foreign loca lities, where the same beds or formations are well identified with the English strata. Geologists on the Continent, and particularly in France, had till very recently, no accurate knowledge respecting several of these formations ; and their classifications of them are vague and contradictory*.

When the magne sian limestone is absent, the red marie occupies its place : some geologists regard the magnesian lime stone as an accidental formation in the red marie. Magnesian limestone is so called, because some of the beds contain a large portion of magnesia, com bined with calcareous earth. The occurrence of magnesia as a constituent part of calcareous rocks, is not peculiar to this limestone; many limestones of the primitive and transition classes contain magnesia : it was first noticed by Dolomieu, and such lime stones are called Dolomites. Primitive dolomite is minutely granular, and is generally so pulverulent, that it may be reduced to powder by the fingers. Transition dolomites, and the dolomites in the upper secondary strata, possess no well marked external characters, by which the presence of magnesia may be ascertained : they dissolve more slowly in acids than common limestone. The nresence of mag-- _ o nesian earth in the proportion of nearly one half in certain limestones, is a fact that strongly militates against the theory which ascribes the formation of all limestone rocks to animal secretion ; unless it shall be found that magnesian earth is contained in the shells and exuvi\u00e6 of marine animals. I be lieve no analyses of shells or coral have yet been made, in order to ascertain the presence of mag nesia as one oftheir constituent elements. Should magnesia be found in the exuvi\u00e6 of certain orders of marine animals, and not in others, it would not"], [280, "238 MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE. only favour the opinion that limestone was of animal origin, but might also explain the cause ofthe alter nation of beds of magnesian limestone with beds of common limestone in the same mountain. Or should shells ofthe same species contain magnesia, and others only calcareous earth, it would prove that under different circumstances, the same animal might form its shell of different constituent parts. The magnesian limestone is distinctly stratified, the strata vary in thickness from a few inches to se veral feet; in the northern counties ofEngland they are nearly horizontal, they border the great coal formation and cover it on the eastern side. This formation of limestone extends from the mouth of the Tyne to near Nottingham. The colour of the limestone is generally a yellowish or reddish brown, varying in intensity from a fawn colour to that of an overburnt brick. Some ofthe lowest beds are blueish and slaty, and intermixed with marie ; but these beds do not rise to the surface in Durham, and their nature is little known. Some beds of magnesian limestone have a granular sandy struc ture, others are imperfectly crystalline ; they pos sess a considerable degree of hardness. A cellular variety of this limestone occurs near Sunderland, which has received the name of Honeycomb lime stone ; it agrees in most of its characters with the rauche wacke of Thuringia, which is part of the zetchstein formation. Many of the beds of this limestone yield a f\u0153tid smell when struck with a hammer. The quantity of magnesia in the different beds of this limestone varies from 30 to 45 per cent, and some of the beds"], [281, "239 MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE. contain little or no magnesia. At Sunderland, the beds of magnesian limestone are more developed than in any other part of England that I am acquaint ed with. In an account I published ofthe Geology of Durham in the Philosophical Magazine for 1815, I estimated the total thickness at one hundred and fifty yards. Below the surface, this limestone has been bored into, to a considerable depth; the lime stone was, as before mentioned, of ablueish colour. According to Mr. Farey, \" under the yellow beds of magnesian limestone, there are several beds of com pact blue limestone, abounding with Anomia(Tere bratul\u00e6) and other shells ; some of these beds differ entirely from the yellow and red beds, and are more useful for agricultural purposes, particularly on the yellow limestone lands*.\" The lower beds of this formation are, I believe, more fully developed in many parts of the continent than in this country, which occasions some uncertainty in classing them. The limestone of Thuringia, it is agreed by the most respectable geologists, is zetchstein, corresponding with our magnesian limestone ; the lower part is a slatv marie, sometimes impregnated with bitumen, and sometimes with sand. This bed contains im pressions of fish, like the lower beds of the slaty Sunderland magnesian limestone; it contains also a small quantity of copper pyrites, and the ores of lead, cobalt, zinc, bismuth, and arsenic, and is in some places worked by the miners for its mineral treasures. Above this bed there occurs a blackish gray com pact limestone, very hard and tenacious, and di stinctly stratified ; over this is a cellular limestone; * Survey os Derbyshire, page 157."], [282, "240 MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE. and above this, a blackish brown limestone, which yields a f\u0153tid smell when struck with a hammer, and is in some places more than one hundred feet in thickness. All these different beds Humboldt com prises under the name of zetchstein, and agrees with other geologists in referring them to our magnesian limestone ; the lowest bed rests on the red sand stone, and sometimes alternates with it : but accord ing to some geologists, the connection between the two formations of red sandstone and zetchstein is such, that they may be regarded as one formation. Several of the characters, particularly the zoological ones, appear rather more appropriate to the lias. Some beds abound in gryphites, (the Gryph\u00e6a acu leala,) and the remains of small saurian animals are found in them. The upper beds of zetchstein in Switzerland alternate with beds of gypsum, which is intermixed with rock-salt ; at least they are gene rally described as zetchstein : some of the beds are argillaceous limestone, containing ammonites and belemnites, and appeared to me to have a greater resemblance to lias than to magnesian limestone. In the lower part of the magnesian limestone in the West of England, there is a conglomerate lime stone, which contains fragments of transition lime stone, varying in size from several inches in dia meter, to very minute grains. The fossils in magnesian limestone are not nu merous, at least in the upper beds. Neither gry phites, belemnites, nor ammonites, which occur in the zetchstein of Germany and Switzerland, have yet been discovered in this formation in England. Magnesian limestone furnishes the most durable"], [283, "RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. 241 building stone that is any where found in the upper secondary strata. I do not agree in opinion with those who regard the magnesian limestone districts as unfertile ; and perhaps no parts of England are more salubrious than those which have a subsoil of this limestone. A few small strings of lead ore have been found in the magnesian limestone rocks near Sunderland. The limestone rocks on the coast of Durham are wearing away by the violence of the ocean ; they have evidently extended much further to the east than at present. Red Marie and Sandstone. \u2014 The beds of this formation have generally the red colour which the name implies, but are often marked with irregular veins and spots, of a yellowish or blueish colour, and the sandstone is sometimes gray, with occasional spots of red. The composition of different strata in this forma tion is extremely various: in some parts we find an argillaceous marie in different states of induration ; in other parts we meet with regular strata of sili ceous sandstone ; and sometimes we have a con glomerate sandstone, or a soft sandstone, inclosing rounded pebbles of quartz and Lydian stone, as in the rock on which Nottingham and the Castle stand. In the lower part of this formation, the beds are porphyritic, and contain imperfect crystals of felspar; sometimes they pass into amygdaloid and trap. The fine siliceous sandstones, when closely examined, are often found to contain fragments of the neighbouring rocks : thus the sandstone in the vicinity of Charnwood Forest contains fragments p."], [284, "242 RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. of slate and chlorite slate ; and the conglomerate beds on the northern side of that range of hills, are principally composed of fragments of granitic and slate rocks. No formation presents such a great variety of mineral characters as the red marie and sandstone, and geologists have frequently been greatly peq.lexed in their attempts to arrange and class the beds which occur in this formation. In England it has frequently been confounded with the red sandstone and conglomerate that occur under the upper transition limestone, called by En glish geologists the old red sandstone. But the old red sandstone of foreign geologists, or roth-todte liegende, the gres ancien of Daubuisson, covers the coal formation, and therefore corresponds with the lowest beds of the English red marie and sand stone. Where the red marie formation is fully deve loped, it may be arranged under three divisions: the lower, which corresponds with the roth-todte liegende, consisting of fragments of different rocks cemented by sand or marie, and of beds of imper fect porphyry ; the middle beds, consisting chiefly of sandstone, called by the French gres rouge and gres des Vosges ; and the upper, consisting of marie and variegated sandstone, in which beds of rock salt and gypsum occur; this corresponds with the gres bigarre of the French. In England the three divisions of this formation rarely if ever occur together accompanied with magnesian limestone ; but it should appear, from the situation of these different beds on the Continent, that the place of the magnesian limestone is between the lower and"], [285, "RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. 243 the middle division : the magnesian limestone or zetchstein rests on the conglomerate beds of red sandstone. In the 3rd Number of the Annales des Mines 1827, there is a very full account of the different arenaceous strata that separate the coal strata from lias limestone, along the feet of the Vosges mountains on the eastern side of France, by M. L. Elie de Beaumont. This account throws considerable light on a part of geology, hitherto obscured by the conflicting opinions of former observers, and assimilates the red sandstone of France and Germany, with the different divisions ofthe same formation in England. The Vosges mountains are composed of granite and transition rocks, and at their feet there are several coal-fields : the coal strata, and also the lower de clivities of the granite, are in part covered uncon formably by nearly horizontal strata of red sand stone, and this is covered by lias limestone. We have here, on a larger scale, an exact correspon dence with the geology of the Charnwood Forest district, where the granite and slate rocks are bordered by coal strata, and are both partly covered by horizontal strata of red marie and sandstone, and this again is covered by lias limestone. The red sandstone of the Vosges is however more developed ; the lowest part consists of conglomerate and por phyroidal beds: these cover the coal strata; they agree in their mineral characters precisely with the conglomerates in the English red sandstone, par ticularly those of Devonshire, and are described by M. Beaumont as being the true roth-todte liegende. Above this occurs a considerable thickness of strata r2"], [286, "244 RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. of red sandstone, which passes by gradation into thc conglomerate ; this is the proper gres rouge: it is designated by M. Beaumont gres des Vosges ; it approaches in its character nearer to the gres bigarre than to the lower beds. The variegated sandstone, or gres bigarre, covers the gres des Vosges ; but there appears to have been a consi derable degradation of the surface of the gres des Vosges, and also a disturbance of the beds by sub sidence or faults, before it was covered by the gres bigarre or variegated sandstone : nevertheless they are evidently members of the same formation. The gres bigarre is covered by an extensive formation of lias limestone in horizontal strata. In the sand stone of the Vosges, we have all the different divi sions ofthe English red marie and sandstone brought together; and from hence it would appear, that the gres ancien, the roth-todte liegende, and the gres bigarre, which it has been hitherto difficult to as similate with the English red marie and sandstone, are only the lower and upper parts of one formation, though they are sometimes separated by intervening beds of limestone. The beds of red marie and sandstone of this for mation, occupy a considerable part of the midland counties in England, extending from the eastern side of Yorkshire into Devonshire, and on the west, with some interruption, from Cumberland to Glou cestershire. The beds or strata never attain any considerable elevation ; they cover or inclose rocks of other for mations : in Leicestershire and Warwickshire they surround rocks of sienite, granite, porphyry slate,"], [287, "RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. 245 greenstone, and quartz. The granite and green stone of the Malvern Hills are covered on the southern side by the same red marie and sandstone. In Devonshire, several rocks of greenstone and amygdaloidal trap are also surrounded by it ; and at Rouvray in France, on the road to Dijon, I ob served a low range of sienitic and granitic rocks, rising from a similar red marie, which like the En glish red marie, was covered by blue lias with gry phites. It was formerly maintained by Mr. Farey, that the sienitic and granite rocks of Charnwood Forest and Malvern, were merely anomalous masses in the red marie ; and though this opinion was deemed extravagant, and afterwards abandoned by Mr. Farey himself, I am inclined to believe, that there is a greater connection between these differ ent formations, than has hitherto been admitted. The red marie and sandstone of England appear to me to have been principally formed by the disin tegration of rocks of trap, greenstone, sienite, and granular quartz ; the iron in the decomposing trap rocks has probably given to this formation its red colour: I conceive that the argillaceous marles have also been principally formed from the trap rocks, and the siliceous sandstones from the granular quartz rock. That rocks of sienite, trap, and quartz, were once extensively spread over the districts now co vered with red marie, might I think be sufficiently established, by tracing them through the red marie districts, where they just peep above the surface, or they might be ascertained by sinking. The sienitic rocks of Charnwood Forest may be distinctly traced into Warwickshire ; from thence to the"], [288, "246 RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. Malvern Hills the connection may be followed ; and from the Malvern Hills to the trap rocks in Glou cestershire, Somersetshire, and Devonshire ; but every where accompanied by the red marie, or near to it. The quartz rock at the Lickey near Broms grove is not, as has hitherto been believed, the only rock of the kind in the midland counties ; it may be found near Atherstone in Warwickshire, and is doubtless associated with the greenstone rocks in that neighbourhood, as members of the Charnwood Forest range of hills*. I was informed by T. Johnston, Esq. of Exeter, that he had frequently examined the red ground in the vicinity of the different trap rocks in Devon shire, and that he invariably found it composed of fragments of these rocks, increasing in size as he approached nearer to them. The sand rock on which Nottingham and Nottingham Castle are built, has evidently been formed of the ruins of more ancient rocks in its vicinity ; and the rounded pebbles of white quartz and of Lydian stone, would indicate that they might have come from rocks formerly connected with the Charnwood Forest range. Still nearer the present hills, the finest sandstone contains fragments of slate, and the lower conglomerate is almost entirely composed of the * In the village of Hartshill near Atherstone, when the au thor was at school there, the quartz rock was employed in mending the roads : it is granular without cement, and breaks into sharp edged fragments ; it has a light reddish colour. When a handful of the fragments are taken from the roads, and thrown upon the ground forcibly in the dark, they produce numerous 6ciutillations like stars, \u2014 an experiment which has often excited the surprise ofthe author and his schoolmates."], [289, "247 RED MARLE AND SANDSTONE. fragments of those hills, as before observed. In the Vosges, the red sandstone every where accompanies the granitic and transition rocks, of which it also contains fragments. It must be recollected that the rocks which were the most disposed to decom pose or disintegrate, would be the soonest worn down. We have no rocks of soft granite or sienite in England, like those of Auvergne or of the Forez mountains in France, and the reason why we have not, may be, that from their small magnitude they were probably carried away by those mighty inun dations, that have swept over our present islands and continents. The Malvern Hills, the Lickey, the Charnwood Forest Hills, and the trap rocks in Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and Devonshire, are the remaining nuclei of much larger ranges, as the scattered fragments in the adjacent, as well as in distant districts attest. If the red marie and sandstone in England, and in other countries, were formed of decomposing rocks of trap, granular quartz, porphyry, sienite and granite, the frequent occurrence of porphyroidal beds in this formation may admit of a probable explanation. It is not intended to maintain that every bed or stratum in this extensive formation is composed principally of the fragments of transition and trap rocks ; but it may safely be affirmed, that there are few strata, in which some of these fragments may not be discovered. The red marie produces some ofthe most fertile soils in England, which may be partly owing to its formation from soft trap rocks. Some basaltic rocks decompose rapidly, and are known to form"], [290, "248 GYPSUM. soil favourable to vegetation ; several basaltic rocks in Staffordshire decompose into a reddish brown clay, moderately tenacious. The most valuable mineral substances found in the red marie are gypsum and rock-salt. The gypsum is both fibrous and massive; the fibrous gypsum forms numerous alternating seams in cliffs of red marie ; the seams vary in thickness from one to three inches, and might be mistaken for strata, but they are irregular and of limited extent. In Nottinghamshire, the fibrous gypsum on the banks of the Trent is often beautifully white and translu cent, and is accompanied with scales of chlorite, ex actly similar to what I have observed in the beds of gypsum in the Valais in Switzerland. The white fibrous gypsum is employed by the paper-makers to whiten writing-paper. Massive gypsum is granular; it occurs in irregular beds and blocks in the red marie, and is evidently a local formation. Anhydrous gypsum is occasion ally met with in Nottinghamshire. Gypsum is asso ciated with rock-salt wherever the latter mineral is found. In the Alps it is now discovered, that the gypsum when uncovered in its native beds is always anhydrous. Common gypsum contains 21 per centos water. Anhydrous gypsum is entirely free from water, and is much harder and heavier than common gypsum. Should it prove a general fact, that the gypsum associated with rock-salt is always originally anhydrous, it might tend to elucidate the formation of both minerals ; a subject which will be referred to, after describing some of the prin cipal repositories of rock-salt."], [291, "ROCK-SALT. 249 Many repositories of rock-salt are situated near the feet of mountain ranges, and have probably been originally deposited in salt-water lakes : beds of rock salt are now found at the bottom of some of the salt lakes in Africa. But though many salt forma tions are in comparatively low situations, there are others that occur at great altitudes, both in the Alps and the Cordilleras. In England, the prin cipal beds of rock-salt are situated at a little distance from the western side of the range of hills, which separate the rivers that flow into the eastern and the western seas. The rock-salt of Cheshire cannot properly be said to lie in or under the red sand rock before de scribed, but is surrounded by it, and probably rests upon it ; but as the lowest bed of salt has not been sunk through, this cannot be yet ascertained. The upper bed of rock-salt in that county is about forty two yards below the surface : it is twenty-six yards thick, and is separated from the lower bed of salt, by a stratum of argillaceous stone ten yards thick. The lower salt has been sunk into forty yards. The upper bed was discovered about a hundred and forty years since, in searching for coal. Rock-salt at Northwich extends in a direction from N.E. to S.W. one mile and a half; its further extent in this direction has not been ascertained : its breadth is about fourteen hundred yards. In another part of Cheshire three beds of rock-salt have been found. The uppermost is four feet, the second twelve feet, and the lower has been sunk into twenty-five yards, but is not cut through. Besides the beds of rock salt, numerous brine springs, containing more than"], [292, "250 ROCK-SALT. 25 per cent of salt, rise in that country. The trans parent specimens of rock-salt are nearly free from foreign impurities, and contain scarcely any water of crystallization. In sea-water a large portion of muriate and sul phate of magnesia is found, which gives it that bit ter nauseous taste, distinct from its saltness. This difference in the composition of sea-water and of rock-salt, might seem to indicate that rock-salt was not, as some suppose, produced by the evaporation of sea-water ; but if it were formed in detached lakes, it is possible that the waters of these lakes, did not contain precisely the same salts in solution, as those of the sea. We know that the waters of some of the salt lakes existing at present, differ in their contents from sea-water. If, however, the eva poration were very slow, the salt of the ocean would separate from all its impurities by crystallization ; these impurities being more deliquescent, might be washed away. It may deserve notice, that few, if any, remains of marine or other organized bodies are found in the beds accompanying the rock-salt of Cheshire. In the Polish salt-mines, bivalve shells and the claws of crabs are met with in the upper strata of marie : and vegetable impressions in the bed covering the lower salt, at .the depth of two hundred and twenty five yards from the surface. The salt formation at Droitwich in Worcester shire appears to be surrounded by the same kind of rock, and covered with similar beds of gypsum and marie, to that of Cheshire. Here the rock-salt, though its existence has been proved by boring, is"], [293, "251 ROCK-SALT. no where worked. The salt is procured by evapo rating the water, which is nearly saturated with it. Salt springs rise in some of the coal strata adja cent to the red marie and sandstone; in all proba bility the brine is infiltered from that formation, into the basset edges of the strata overlying coal. There are salt springs in some of the coal-mines in Nor thumberland; and a spring of brine rises in the river Wear, in the county of Durham. Brine springs, containing from 5 to 6 per cent of salt, rise in the coal-mines near Ashby-de-la- Zouch in Leicestershire, at the depth of two hun dred and twenty-five yards under the surface. A weaker brine also rises in the upper strata : it springs through fissures in the coal, attended with a hissing noise occasioned by the emission of hydrogen gas. I examined these mines belonging to the Earl of Moira in the summer of 1812 : they are situated at Ashby Wolds, in the very centre of England* ; and what may appear remarkable in this situation, they are worked one hundred and forty yards be low the level ofthe sea, which is ascertained from the levels of the canal that passes by the pits. Had this circumstance been known before the attention of geologists was directed to the structure of the earth's surface, it would have been inferred, that brine springs so far below the level of the sea, had their source from the waters of the ocean, perco lating through fissures in the earth. There are many salt springs in France, but no * Baths and hotels are now erected there for the accommoda tion of visiters ; they are called the Moira Baths, near Ashby de-la-Zouch."], [294, "252 ROCK-SALT. mines of rock-salt. The salt springs at Salins in the department of the Jura, rise in the red marie formation; and the gypsum with which they are as sociated is exactly similar to the massive gypsum in the English red marie. The strongest of these springs contains 15 per cent of salt. In Switzerland the rock-salt and gypsum do not occur in the red marie, but between calcareous beds, which are, I believe, analogous to the En glish lias, and will be again mentioned. In Spain there are several salt springs and beds of rock-salt ; the principal formation of rock-salt at Cardona in Catalonia has been described by Count Alexander Laborde, in his magnificent work en titled Voyages Pittoresques dans I'Espagne. \"The salt district of Cardona comprehends the hill on which the town is situated, and the environs of more than a league in circumference. The sur face is almost every where covered with vegetable soil to the depth of six inches or more, which ren ders it productive. The place where the rock-salt is procured is a valley forming an oval, about one mile and a half in length, and half a mile in breadth from east to west, extending from the Castle of Car dona to the promontory of red salt at the other end. The last is the most considerable of the salt rocks, and has not yet been worked ; it is six hun dred and sixty-three feet in height, and twelve hun dred and twenty feet in breadth at its base. This valley is also traversed by a chain of hills of rock salt : besides these, there are other rocks of salt at the feet of the fortress, and upon the declivity of the mountain which stretches to the fountain called"], [295, "253 ROCK-SALT. Cancunillo. The mountain of red salt is so called because that colour predominates ; but the colours vary with the altitude of the sun, and the greater or less quantity of rain. At the foot of this moun tain a spring of water issues, which comes through a fissure we perceive on the summit. The rivulet runs all along Ihe valley from the east, but passes under ground in part of its course, particularly un der the hill where the rock-salt is mined ; it rises again to the surface at a little distance, and, after running along the plain, discharges itself into the river Cardona. This brook in rainy seasons swells the waters of the river, which then become salt, and destroy the fish ; but at three leagues lower, the water has no perceptible taste of salt. All these salt mountains are intersected by crevices and chasms; and have also spacious grottoes, where are found stalactites of salt, shaped like bunches of grapes, and of various colours.\" \" Nothing can compare with the magnificence ofthe spectacle which the moun tain of Cardona exhibits at sunrise. Besides the beautiful forms which it presents, it appears to rise above the river like a mountain of precious gems, displaying the various colours produced by the re fraction ofthe solar rays through a prism.\" \" Hungary and Poland afford the most numerous and extensive repositories of rock-salt in Europe. The salt-mines of Welielska near Cracovia have been long celebrated and frequently described; they are worked at the depth of 750 feet. The rock salt is covered by alternate beds of marie and con glomerate ; blocks of salt occur also in the marie. The beds of rock-salt are inclined at an angle of"], [296, "254 ROCK-SALT. 40 degrees. It is remarkable, that in these mines of rock-salt, there are springs of fresh as well as of salt water. At Paraid in Transylvania, there is a valley the bottom and sides of which are pure rock salt. The mine of Eperies is about 990 feet deep. Water is sometimes inclosed in the blocks of rock salt.\" \u2014 Brongniart, Mineralogie. There is an extensive formation of rock-salt, stretching on each side of the Carpathian Moun tains for six hundred miles, from Welielska in Po land towards the north, to Rimnie in Moldavia on the south. It has indeed been observed that rock salt and brine-springs most generally occur near the feet of extensive mountain ranges, which adds pro bability to the opinion, that these ranges were once the boundaries of extensive salt lakes. In the lofty deserts of Caramania in Asia, accord ing to Chardin, rock-salt is so abundant, and the at mosphere so dry, that the inhabitants use it as stone, for building their houses. This mineral is also found on the whole elevated table-land of Great Tartary, Thibet, and Indostan. Extensive plains in Persia are covered with a saline efflorescence ; and accord ing to the account of travellers, the island of Ormus, in the Persian Gulf, is one large mass of rock-salt. In the elevated mountains of Peru, rock-salt is said to occur at the height of 9000 feet above the level of the sea. In North America there are various salt-springs called Licks, because the herds of wild cattle formerly repaired to them, to lick the soil impregnated with salt. Near to these places the immense bones of the great Mastodon are fre quently found at a small depth below the surface."], [297, "ROCK-SALT. 255 According to the account of Hornemann, there is a mass of rock-salt spread over the mountains that bound the desert of Libya to the north, so vast that no eye can reach its termination in one direction ; and its breadth he computed to be several miles. Rock-salt has also been found in New South Wales. It would exceed the limits intended for the pre sent volume, to enumerate the different places in which this valuable mineral occurs. I only propose to note the more remarkable situations presenting ph\u00e6nomena that may tend to illustrate the mode of its formation. Among these should not be omitted the salt lakes on the borders of Caffraria, east of the Cape of Good Hope, which contain at their bottom, thick beds of rock-salt variously coloured. There is a remarkable formation of salt at Posa near Burgos, in Castille, placed in an immense cra ter of an extinct volcano, in which are found pu mice-stone and puzzolana. The volcanic mountain of Cologero near Sciacca, in Sicily, contains in its beds a considerable intermixture of common salt, and masses of rock-salt occur in other parts of the island, imbedded in clay*. In these and in some other instances, it is probable that subterranean fire may have been an active agent in the formation of rock-salt, by evaporating the waters of salt lakes, or of countries recently emerged from the ocean. The rapid formation of rock-salt in Syria, during one of those igneous eruptions which have at times overwhelmed certain portions of the globe, is, per haps, obscurely alluded to by the sacred writer who * Travels in Sicily, by Lieut. Gen. Cockburn."], [298, "256 SALIFEROUS GYPSUM. has narrated the early history of the human race. Gen. chap, xix.* The salt lakes existing in that country are well known. Whether all the repositories of rock-salt above enumerated occur in the red marie, cannot in the present state of our information be accurately ascer tained. The great formation of rock-salt and gyp sum near Bex in Switzerland, constitutes two large and extensive beds. The lowest rests upon black limestone, argillaceous limestone, and sandstone ; and between the lower gypsum and the upper, there are thick beds of argillaceous limestone, and similar argillaceous limestone, forms caps over the upper gypsum. The gypsum in the large beds is anhy drous, and contains particles of rock-salt and com mon gypsum disseminated through it. The prevail ing fossils are ammonites and belemnites. \u2014 (Travels in the Tarentaise, p. 415.) The mineral characters of the strata at Bex, and the imbedded fossils, incline me rather to refer the argillaceous limestone, over and under the gypsum and salt beds, to the English lias, than to magnesian limestone. The saliferous gypsum in the Tarentaise is also anhydrous, and contains a considerable quantity of silex ; it occurs interstratified with limestone, which bears a nearer resemblance to the magnesian lime stone, than to lias. The tops of some of the moun tains are covered with beds of common gypsum, * Jerom, who resided in Syria in the fourth century, informs us, that the rock of salt was existing in his time ; and fancifully relates certain peculiarities respecting it, which equal in absurdity the legends ofthe darkest ages of papal superstition."], [299, "257 GYPSUM OF THE ALPS. intermixed with native sulphur. In one ofthe rocks associated with the gypsum formation, I discovered a fossil Patella. Though a branch of the Ecole des Mines, with able instructors fromParis, had been for some years established at Moutiers, close to the salt formations, a very erroneous opinion respecting the gypsum of the Tarentaise was maintained by the professors ; namely, that the gypsum merely formed an unconformable covering over the adjacent moun tains. I observed it in several parts of the valley of the Doron near Moutiers, as distinctly interstra tified in the calcareous mountains, as the gypsum of Montmartre is interstratified between the tertiary formations near Paris. In one ofthe beds of gyp sum, there was a thin stratum of carbonaceous matter, which soiled the fingers like coal smut; this is the only instance of carbonaceous matter found in gypsum, that I am acquainted with. Transparent colourless rock-salt consists of muriat of soda, nearly in the highest state of purity ; or, ac cording to Sir H. Davy, of chlorine and sodium. It has so little water of crystallization, that it scarcely decrepitates when thrown on burningcoals, in which it differs from salt prepared artificially by evapora tion. Specimens of rock-salt brought from the Polish mines, are less disposed to deliquesce than those from Cheshire. The deep red colour very common to rock-salt is derived from the oxide of iron. Clay or marie commonly accompany rock-salt; it fre quently lies imbedded in clay in detached masses ; the clay is often much impregnated with salt, which is extracted from it by solution in water. The al most constant occurrence of sulphat of lime (gyp- s"], [300, "258 FORMATION OF ROCK-SALT. sum) with rock-salt, is also a fact of considerable interest. It is curious to observe the two most powerful acids, the sulphuric and muriatic, so nearly associated in the same place. This fact, in a more advanced state of science, may elucidate the chemical chans.es which have effected the forma tion of these minerals. The most natural hypothesis respecting the forma tion of rock-salt, at least in some situations, is that before stated, which attributes it to the gradual eva poration of lakes and pools of salt water, which remained, when the ocean retired from the present continents. This mineral by slow evaporation would be separated from the impure salts that exist in sea water; and as these salts are more deliquescent than rock-salt, they might be washed away, before the beds of rock-salt were covered with earthy strata. The occurrence of anhydrous gypsum with rock salt, which is also anhydrous, would, however, indi cate the action of heat in the formation of these mi nerals ; for it is scarcely possible to conceive any mode of aqueous deposition that could form anhy drous gypsum : but common gypsum might be fused by heat, and its water of crystallization expelled ; it would then be converted into anhydrous gypsum. From the observations of M. Charpentier at Bex, it appears -that the great beds of gypsum associated with rock-salt, are always found to be anhydrous when they are laid open to the atmosphere, but they soon absorb water, and are converted into common gypsum. The saliferous gypsum in other parts of the Alps, is also anhydrous ; and if it should appear that the beds of gypsum associated with"], [301, "FOOT-MARKS IN RED SANDSTONE. 259 rock-salt in other countries are anhydrous, where they have not been exposed to the action of mois ture, it would add much probability to the opinion, that the consolidation of rock-salt and gypsum had been effected by heat. Before concluding the account of the red marie and sandstone formation, it may be proper to state, that foreign geologists contend for the existence of a red sandstone over coal, which is laid conformably with the coal strata, and is a part of that formation *. If such a red sandstone, distinct from the new red sandstone, exist any where in England, it is near Oldham and Rochdale in Lancashire. The sand stone of Lancashire is coloured in Mr. Greenough's Geological Map of England, as the new red sand stone, and in Mr. Smith's Geological Map, as the old red sandstone; but I am inclined to believe, that the true position (gisement) of this sandstone in * Le Gres, masse principale de terrain houiller, prende souvent une grande extension, en abandonnant au moins en majeure partie la houille avec I'argile schisteuse qui l'envelloppe. \u2014 Daubuisson, Traite de Geognosie, torn. 2.

Humboldt, in his Essai Geognoslique sur le Gisement des Roches, p. 199, mentions a red sandstone passing into por phyry, as the upper part of the coal formation in Germany. Messrs. Daubuisson and Bonnard appear to have mistaken the lowest part of the red marie and sandstone, for a portion of the regular coal strata. M. Humboldt makes a distinction be tween the unconformable red sandstone and the porphyritic red sandstone, which he cites as a part of the regular coal forma tion. S 2"], [302, "260 FOOT-MARKS IN RED SANDSTONE. many parts of Lancashire, is not yet ascertained : its relations w ith the coal strata are different from those of the new red sandstone in other parts of England. \u2014 1 propose to revert to this subject in a subsequent chapter. A very remarkable discovery has been recently made, ofthe foot-marks of some unknown quadruped in strata of new red sandstone, at the Corn Cockle Muir, three miles from Lochmaben in Dumfries shire. They were found 45 feet under the present surface; the strata are inclined 37 degrees. This circumstance was communicated to the author by Mr. Murray, jun. of Albemarle-street, who showed him at the same time a plaster cast, taken from a slab of stone, in which the impressions were tolerably distinct, and also part of a thin stratum ofthe stone itself, with indistinct impressions of a similar kind. There can scarcely be a doubt, that they were the real foot-marks of a digitated animal having short toes and claws, and the foot broad in proportion to its length. The breadth of the foot is above one inch. The part of the sandstone in Mr. Murray's possession appeared principally composed of granu lar fragments of reddish quartz rock and felspar, with spots of chlorite or hornblende. As remains of reptiles have been found in the zetchstein or mag nesian limestone on the Continent, which is as an cient as the new red sandstone, may not this animal have been a reptile allied to the tortoise ?"], [303, "261 CHAPTER XII.

The name Lias appears to have been given to it by a provincial pronunciation of the word layers; as the lias limestone strata are generally very regular and flat, and rise in thin slabs or layers when got from the quarry. Where the lias beds are pretty"], [304, "262 LAIS CLAY. fully developed, they form a mass of stratified lime stone and clay, several hundred feet in thickness, which rest upon the red marie described in the pre ceding chapter. The regularly stratified lias limestone occupies the lower part ofthe bed, and the lias clay the upper. The lower beds of the limestone have often a yel lowish white colour, and are called white lias. The blue lias limestone has generally a dark smoke-gray colour, a dull earthy texture, and an imperfectly conchoidal fracture : the purest beds contain from 80 to 90 per cent of carbonate of lime, combined with bitumen, alumine, and iron. If iron enter largely into the composition of this limestone, it forms a lime, when burned, which has the property of setting under water. The finer kinds of white lias will receive a polish, and may be used for lithographic drawings. The lias clay frequently occurs in the form of soft slate or shale, which divides into very thin la min\u00e6. This shale is often much impregnated with bitumen and with iron pyrites, and will continue to burn slowly when laid in heaps with faggots, and once ignited : during this slow combustion, the sul phur in the iron pyrites is decomposed, and com bines with the oxygen of the atmosphere and with a portion of the alumine in the shale, and forms sulphate of alumine or alum. The alum shale of Whitby in Yorkshire is of this kind ; it has rather a soapy feel, and a slight silky lustre. When the lias clay or alum shale falls in large masses from the cliffs upon the sea shore, and gets moistened by"], [305, "263 LIAS CLAY. sea water, it ignites spontaneously, and continues burning a considerable time. The cliffs of lias clay near Lyme in Dorsetshire, took fire after heavy rains, and continued burning for several months, about the middle of the last century; and at the present time the cliffs near Weymouth are ignited by a similar cause. The composition of the clay in those cliffs is nearly the same as in the lias clay ; but it is an upper formation, called Oxford or clunch clay. Lias clay is impregnated with a considerable por tion of muriate of soda, and sulphate of magnesia, and soda. The mineral springs of Cheltenham and Gloucester rise in this clay ; but the mineral quali ties decrease after the springs have been opened some time, which proves that the saline matter is derived from parts ofthe bed adjacent to the springs, and is therefore soon exhausted. The beds of lias clay and limestone are par ticularly distinguished by the number and variety of the organic remains which they contain. Twenty different kinds of ammonites have been discovered in lias, and also various other species of cham bered shells, nautilites, and belemnites. Univalve shells are not numerous in this formation, but a great variety of bivalve shells occur in it. The gryphite (Gryphea arcuata) abounds so much in some of the beds of lias, that in France it has re ceived the name of Calcaire a gryphites. Penta crinites also abound in the upper part of the lias, and in conjunction with gryphites and the am monites that have a ridge between two furrows,"], [306, "264 FOSSILS IN LIAS round the back of the shell, are characteristic of the lias formation. The most remarkable organic remains are how ever, certain species of li-li and those of verte brated animals allied to the order of lizards ; the fossil fish are generally found in the middle of flat tened balls of limestone, in which the form of the body and the scales is often well preserved. The saurian or lizard-shaped animals have left no trace of the form of their bodies, except what can be as certained from the remaining skeletons. To the late Rev. W. D. Conybeare we are indebted for having determined the forms of two genera of these animals. The ichthyosaurus or fish-lizard had the head of a li zard, with a very long pointed muzzle, and numerous conical teeth ; the orbit of the eye is uncommonly large. Some idea may be formed ofthe magnitude of these animals, when I mention that the orbit of the eye in a head, belonging to Mr. Johnson of Bristol, which I measured, was ten inches long and seven broad : the orbit in another head, belonging to the same gentleman, measured nine inches in breadth*. The vertebr\u00e6 of the ichthyosaurus resemble those ofa shark, which enabled it to bend its tail with great facility, and assisted the motion of its paddles, in pro pelling the body with great velocity through w ater. * Mr. Johnson of Bristol has, during many years, devoted much time and labour, and has liberally expended considerable sums of money in collecting organic remains of these saurian animals ; and it is to the collection of these remains in his pri vate museum, that we are principally indebted for the discoveries which have been made respecting them."], [307, "LIAS AT LYME AND WHITBY. 265 Of the ichthyosaurus, four species have been disco vered. The plesiosaurus resembled the former ge nus in many important parts of its osteology; but its vertebr\u00e6 had a closer approximation to those of the crocodile ; they are only slightly concave : its neck was longer than its body, and was composed of thirty vertebr\u00e6, which exceeds the number ofthe cervical vertebr\u00e6 ofthe swan. Five species of these animals have been determined ; some of them were twenty feet in length. The bones of these animals are found very commonly in the cliffs of lias at Lyme in Dorsetshire, and on the southern bank of the Severn. It is not certain that any bones ofthe croco dile genus which had feet havebeen found in lias; but bones ofthe turtle sometimes occur in it. Vegetable remains in lias consist of fossilized wood and jet. The lias formation extends in a waving line through England, from near Whitby in Yorkshire to Lyme in Dorsetshire ; at both its extremities it is fully developed, and presents similar fea tures, namely, \u2014 dark cliffs of blackish clay or alum shale, with a nearly flat floor of lias limestone ex- tendinginto the sea, forming a natural pavement, on which the observer may walk secure, treading at almost every step on the organic remains of the in- habitants of a former world, disseminated through the rock : these animal remains are generally sur- rounded by stone harder than the other part of the stratum, and project above the surface. At Sands- end, near Whitby, the alum shale has been per- forated near the sea, to the depth of one hundred and thirty yards, without penetrating into the sub jacent rock; to which if we add the height of the"], [308, "266 MUSCHELKALK THE LOWEST PART cliffs above, it will make a total thickness of lias exceeding two hundred and twenty yards: the upper parts are more productive of alum than the lower. f n Dorsetshire the whole thickness of the lias forma tion may be seen in succession; a few miles west ot Bridport, the uppermost bed rises above the level of the sea : three miles west of Lyme it terminates, and the white lias (the lowest part of this formation) may be observed at low water resting on red marie. From the observations of M. Elie de Beaumont on the lias near theVosges mountains, it appears that in the lias of France there are certain lower strata nearly filled with shells, and which contain that beau tiful fossil the LilyEncrinite. These strata are want ing in every part of the English lias that has yet been examined : it is to this part of the lias that the name muschelkalk has been given by the Germans, and it has frequently been described as a different forma tion from lias; but M. Beaumont says that the strata above the muschelkalk are the calcairea gryphites, and that the lower and the upper strata are un doubtedly parts of the same formation, lying be tween the red marie, gres bigarre, and the oolites ; and he describes this to be the case with the mus chelkalk in Germany, the lower beds of which also contain the lily encrinite. We have here a key to certain parts of foreign geology, which have hitherto been somewhat obscure : the muschelkalk and the lias are not, as has been often stated, dif ferent formations, but are only different parts of the same bed ; for the description of M. Beaumont is so precise, as to leave no doubt respecting the iden tity of the English lias and the French calcaire d"], [309, "267 OF THE LIAS FORMATION. gryphites, and that the latter and the muschelkalk are only upper and lower strata of lias. In En gland lias limestone occurs almost always in nearly horizontal strata, and never attains any great eleva tion. On the west of Gloucester, at Highnam Park, lias limestone forms a nearly flat pavement, on the summit of a hill about two hundred and fifty feet above the level of the Vale of Severn : from this point to the north-west there is no bed of lias known in England or Wales ; but it is found in the north west part of Ireland, and in some of the Hebrides. At Barrow-on-Soar in Leicestershire, lias rises considerably above the level of the river ; it is in the flattened balls that occur in the Barrow limestone, that the finest specimens of fossil fish are found. The lias clay, from its comparative softness has fre quently been excavated into valleys, \u2014 some of the mountain valleys in the Alps are cut in lias clay. The lias limestone of the Alps and the Jura, loses its flat and parallel stratification, and is bent and contorted in various directions ; it also frequently loses its earthy texture, and is hard and semicrystal line, like transition limestone. The Rev. R. Halifax, of Standish, near Glouces ter, obligingly showed me part of the lias and oolite beds in the vicinity of Cheltenham, which he had particularly studied. Between the upper lias clay and the oolite, there is a thick bed of reddish earth with ferruginous nodules inclosing portions of lias ; this earth may be seen cropping out at the foot of Leck hampton Hill. No well marked natural division exists, which can determine whether this bed should be classed with lias, or the oolites. The fossils in"], [310, "268 OOLITE. lias clay and limestone are nearly black, and are sometimes incrusted with pyrites. The most valuable mineral substances obtain ed from lias in England, are water-setting lime and alum shale. The property of setting under water may be communicated to any kind of lime, by an admixture with burned and pulverized iron stone. Many ofthe bituminous and pyritical shales in the coal strata would yield alum by slow com bustion, if they could be obtained with facility. When alum shale is burned, and the soluble part is extracted by water, it is necessary to add potass before the process of evaporation, as crystallized alum is a triple salt, composed of sulphate of alu mine and potass. Oolite. \u2014 The numerous beds of yellowish limestone alternating with beds of clay, marie, sand, and sand stone, that compose the oolite formation in En gland, are of variable thickness; but their aggregate average depth, from the top of the upperoolite to the lias, may be estimated at 1000 feet. These beds may be traced with little interruption along a waving line from the Cleveland Hills in Yorkshire, into Dorsetshire. In Gloucestershire they compose a lofty range of hills on the south side ofthe Vale of Severn, called the Cotteswold Hills; but no strata of this formation are found in any part of England or Wales, north-west of the river Severn. In many parts of France, the oolite strata accompanied with lias, present all the characters of the same forma tions in England ; but in the Jura mountains, where they are fully developed, the mineral characters often differ considerably; and it is only from the geologi-"], [311, "269 OOLITE. cal position and the imbedded fossils, that they can be identified with the English series. Oolite or Roestone receives its name from the small globules like the roe of a fish, that are im bedded in many of the strata : in some instances these globules attain the size ofa pea, and this va riety has obtained the name of Pisiform oolite. In England, nearly all the beds of limestone that are oolitic, in this formation, have a yellowish brown or ochrey colour, by which they may at first sight be distinguished from lias. The limestone in which the globules are imbedded has generally an earthy texture, and is dull and incapable of receiving a polish : some varieties of oolite have been much used for architecture. St. Paul's, Somerset House, and many of the public buildings in London, are constructed of this stone ; but it is not durable. The occurrence of small oviform globules in limestone is not exclusively confined to the oolite formation; in the magnesian limestone, and even in transition limestone, a tendency to an oolitic structure may sometimes be observed. It is not yet ascertained whether these globules are the result of a tendency to crystalline arrangement, or whether they are of animal origin. The organic remains that occur in the different beds of oolite are so numerous and various, that it would require an ample volume to describe them fully. It will however be necessary to notice those fossil genera that differ remarkably from the genera whose remains are found in the lower strata, and indicate a considerable change in the condition of"], [312, "270 FOSSILS IN OOLITE. the globe, or at least in those parts of it where the strata were deposited. It has been already observed, that the univalve shells in the lower strata were chiefly different spe cies of Nautilites, Ammonites, and Belemnites, which are chambered, and that univalve uncham bered shells were rarely found among them. By far the greater number of genera that have left their remains in these strata belong to the acepha lous molusc\u00e6, or such as had neither heads nor eyes, and inhabited bivalve shells. Even in the lias, only four genera of unchambered univalve shells have been found*, and the individual shells of each genus are very rare ; but in the oolite, the genera and species of univalve unchambered shells are more numerous, and the individual shells of several species abound in some of the strata. Now, as these animals had heads and eyes, and moved on their bellies like the land-snail, we may infer that they did not live in deep seas, where the sense of vision could not be available ; they lived and moved in comparatively shallow water near the shore. The vertebrated animals, whose remains are found in oolite, are some of them of the same genera as those discovered in lias; but others belong to the crocodile genus, and had feet, like the living spe cies of crocodiles, and were probably amphibious : hence we may infer, that there was dry land and rivers in the vicinity. It may well excite surprise, that calcareous strata * The Helicina, 3 species ; the Trochus, 3 species; the Tor. natella, and the Melania."], [313, "FOSSILS IN OOLITE. 271 should so rarely be found which present distinct indications of having been formed exclusively by coralline polypi, particularly as coral rocks and reefs of great extent are so rapidly forming in our present seas. There are however, among the strata of oolite, some which are almost entirely composed of madreporites, and have received the name of coral ragg. There are other strata which abound in the remains of fossil sponges and alcyonia, and with congeries of minute millepores and madrepores. Nearly twenty species of trochiform or top-shaped spiral shells, and several species of echinites, are found in the oolite strata; but in the lias below, only a few species occur, and the individual shells are scarce. The Gryphea arcuata, so common in the lias, is rarely if ever found in the oolite strata; but another species, with an expanded shell, called the Gryphea dilata, is a fossil frequently found in dif ferent beds ofthe oolite formation. The shells and bones in the oolite limestone have the yellowish ochrey colour of the stone in which they are im bedded, which may serve at once to distinguish them from the lias fossils, that invariably partake of the dark colour of the beds in which they occur. English geologists make three divisions of the oolite formation, \u2014 the upper, the middle, and the lower: they are separated by thick beds of clay, and some variety may be observed in the fossils of each di vision, but the general characters are nearly the same ; and in an elementary treatise, a too minute description would only perplex the student, parti cularly as some of the beds appear to be of limited extent."], [314, "272 THE LOWER OOLITE. The lower division of oolite comprises ; first, an imperfect dark brown limestone, much intermixed with sand and the oxide of iron ; 2ndly, beds of ste- rile clay and fullers-earth ; and, 3rdly, the great oolite, which is of considerable thickness, and yields freestone for architecture: it is composed of minute globules and broken shells, united by a yellowish earthy calcareous cement. With the lower division of oolites may also be classed, 4thly, the Stonesfield slate, which is a sandy calcareous stone, dividing into thin strata, accompanied with shale and carbo naceous matter. 5thly, forest marble : the beds are not numerous, and are chiefly composed of large frag ments of shells ; small entire turbinated shells abound in some of the strata. It deserves attention, that the univalve shells are most frequent in the thin beds, and the bivalves in the thicker beds, of this stone. 6thly, cornbrash. This is the upper part of the lower division of oolites ; it does not compose beds of any considerable thickness, nor does it frequently occur in regular strata of any great extent, but generally in detached masses, cemented by clay : the external part of the stone is brown, but the inner part has often a gray or blueish colour. To Mr. Wm. Smith we are principally indebted for the first accurate account ofthe different beds of the oolite formation : he observed that though the total thickness of the cornbrash beds is but small, there is a considerable difference between the fossils in the upper beds and those in the lower ones. Between the lower and the middle division of oolites, there are beds of dark blue clay called Ox ford or Clunchclay; the thickness has been esti-"], [315, "MIDDLE AND UPPER OOLITE. 273 mated at two hundred feet. Some of the beds are bituminous, and bear a near resemblance to lias clay ; they abound in Septaria : other beds are much in termixed with calcareous earth. In the lower part of the Oxford clay, irregular beds of limestone occur, which have received the name of Kelloway rock, from being found near Kelloway bridge, in Wiltshire. The bones of one species of ichthyosaurus, different from those in the lias, have been found in the Ox ford clay. The middle division of oolite consists, lst, of beds of siliceous and calcareous sand : 2ndly, the coral ragg, composedof loose earthy limestone, sometimes entirely formed of several species of branching ma drepores; and 3rdly, the upper oolite: this agrees in many of its characters with the great oolite, but is more perishable ; in some of the beds, the oolitic character is scarcely discernible, in other beds the globules are as large as peas; it has hence received the name of Pisolite. The total thickness of all the beds in this division has been estimated at two hun dred feet. Between the Middle and the Upper division of oolites, there occurs another thick bed of clay, which has received the name of Kimmeridge clay. It is a grayish clay passing into the state of shale, and is sometimes so bituminous as to be used for fuel ; its thickness in some parts is more than one hundred feet. Bones of saurian or lizard-shaped animals have been found in this clay, and also bones of ani mals of a higher order allied to the whale or seal. The upper division of oolite comprises the beds of Portland stone, which have been well described T"], [316, "274 EXTRAORDINARY FOSSILS IN as a calcareo-siliceous freestone, with beds and no dules of flint. In the Isle of Portland, where the middle bed of the Portland stone is quarried for architectural purposes, it is covered by a cream coloured stone called cap, which is only burned for lime: under this, there are two beds of workable stone, each five feet thick, separated by gray flint, and a third bed of the best stone below. The total thickness of the three beds of building-stone varies from 17 to 24 feet. The Purbeck beds are by some geologists classed with the oolites; but they may more properly be regarded as a distinct formation, belonging to the iron-sand, as the fossils contained in these beds differ much from those in the oolite, and are supposed to be freshwater shells. The calcareous sandy slate of Stonesfield, near Woodstock in Oxfordshire, is believed to form a member of the lower oolitic series ; but its organic remains are so different from those in any known beds of oolite, that until it can be seen actually covered by some undisputed member of the oolite series, a doubt must be entertained whether it may not be a portion of a more recent formation out of its place, as we find chalk occasionally beyond the limits generally assigned to it. The Stonesfield slate consists of two beds of yellowish or grayish oolitic limestone, each about two feet thick, and separated by a bed of loose calcareous sandstone about the same thickness. The Stonesfield slate on exposure to frost divides into thin plate9, which are used for roofing. The stone is obtained by working horizontal galleries in the hill, which galleries communicate with deep per-"], [317, "STONESFIELD SLATE. 275 pendicular shafts. It is to be regretted that no ac count has been yet published of the different strata of stone sunk through by these shafts, as we might hence derive decisive evidence, respecting the true geological position of the Stonesfield slate. The fossil remains in the Stonesfield slate, con sist of the impressions of the outer cases or elytra of winged insects, and the bones of animals of the opossum or didelphis genus, and also the bones of the megalosaurus or gigantic lizard, supposed to be analogous to the Monitor. From the size of these bones, it is estimated that the animal to which they belonged, was forty feet in length and twelve feet high. Legs and thigh bones of birds are also found in the Stonesfield slate, with the teeth, palates, and vertebr\u00e6 of fishes, and two or three varieties of crabs and lobsters. Several varieties of marine shells and of plants occur in the same beds. The most re markable circumstance attending these fossil re mains, is, that they should occur in strata which are generally believed to have been deposited be fore the creation of terrestrial mammalia. If how ever, there were islands, inhabited by the higher class of animals, when the oolite beds were form ing, their bones may have been carried down by rivers into the sea, and deposited with those of ma rine animals. But though this hypothesis might satisfactorily explain the occurrence of these re mains in the Stonesfield slate, it would still be not less extraordinary, that similar remains should have been no where found in any of the upper secondary strata in England, nor in other countries ; and that they are never met with, except in strata consi- t 2"], [318, "276 OOLITE OF THE derably above the chalk formation. The occur rence of wood, and beds of lignite (or wood coal) in oolite, confirms the opinion that dry land existed somewhere in the vicinity at the period when the oolitic beds were formed or deposited; but no indi cation that the land was inhabited by terrestrial quadrupeds has been hitherto discovered, except in the slate of Stonesfield. In the strata above the oolite, particularly in the iron-sand of Cuckfield, the bones of the megalosaurus and crocodile, and those of turtles, birds, and fish, present a similarity to the fossils of Stonesfield; but the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds are wanting, and many of the shells are fluviatile. But where was the island on which the animals lived and flourished, that have left their bones in the strata of Stonesfield ? This question will be considered in the brief chapter I propose to give of the Geology of England. Observations. The oolites on the continent are frequently accompanied with beds of lignite : in England, lignite is not found in oolite, but in the thick beds of clay which separate the upper and the middle divisions of this formation. In returning from the county of Durham in 1820, I took a hasty morning survey of the oolite of the Cleveland Hills in Yorkshire, in the immediate vicinity of Thirk. I had not time to visit the coal mines; but from the specimens of coal I saw lying by the road side, I should con sider it as a lignite, and not a true mineral coal : it is chiefly employed in burning lime, and is not used for domestic purposes, except by the poor. The oolite of the Cleveland Hills inclines to a light smoke gray colour ; it is distinctly oolitic ; the stone is more compact and hard than the oolites of Oxfordshire or Gloucestershire, and bears a near resemblance to some of the Jim stone beds on the Jura, which I saw the same summer. The"], [319, "277 CLEVELAND HILLS. Cleveland oolite appears to rest immediately on a sandy red earth, like that over the lias near Cheltenham, and according to the account of the quarrymen, the bed below is a dark soft shale, which they considered to be the same as the alum shale (Has) on the north side of the same range of hills. Some geologists, and particularly M. Humboldt, describe a formation of sand stone called quader sandstein, as being directly interposed between the lias and the oolites. Many English geologists re gard this sandstone as identical with the iron.sand or Hastings sand. According to Humboldt, quader sandstein has a whitish yellowish or grayish colour; the grains are fine, and are united by an almost invisible argillaceous or siliceous cement : it con tains but little mica, which is always of a silvery colour, and oc curs in detached scales. \u2014 Essai sur le Gisement des Roches, p. 268. The quader sandstein placed between Has and oolite, corresponds in geological position with the sandy beds, that se parate these formations in Gloucestershire ; but the quader sandstein described by other geologists as containing numerous vegetable fossil remains, may with much probability be referred to the iron-sand over the oolite, which will be described io the following chapter."], [320, "278 CHAPTER XIII.

In certain countries, particular formations occupy a consider able extent, and are of great thickness; in other countries, similar formations are often wanting al together, or the beds are so thin as scarcely to excite notice. The upper secondary strata cover more than one half of England, and hence the English geologist might be suspected of bestowing upon them too great a portion of his attention ; but a more accurate examination of other countries, has fully proved, that many of the British strata which were formerly believed to be of very limited extent, are spread over a great pact of Europe, and preserve the same order of succession as in our own island :"], [321, "279 . FRESHWATER formations. \u2014 a description of these strata is therefore an es sential part of general geology. The formations of the magnesian limestone, the red marie, the lias, the oolites, and the chalk, have risen into geolo gical importance within the last twelve years ; and the reproach cast upon South Britain by our neigh bours on the other side of the Tweed, namely, \"that there was little or nothing in England worth the attention of a geologist,\" has lost all its force. The beds of sand and clay, that intervene between the two last formations above enumerated, were how ever still more recently regarded as unworthy of particular notice, as it could not be expected, that beds of sand or clay should preserve the regularity of stony strata, over a great extent of surface : but the recent labours of Mr. Mantell and of Dr. Fitton, have made us acquainted with facts respecting these earthy and sandy deposits, which are scarcely ex ceeded in interest, by any discoveries in the lower strata. In some of the lower formations we occasionally find indications of dry land and fresh-water having existed in the vicinity at the time when the strata were deposited; but we no where discover a single stratum, of which we can say decidedly, \u2014 this was once the dry surface of an island, or a continent. In the strata which we are now to describe, the shells belong chiefly, if not exclusively, to species which are regarded as river shells ; and the abun dance of tree-ferns and other land plants indicate, that the strata in which they are found, was the soil on which they originally grew: this is rendered still more probable by the occurrence of the bones and"], [322, "280 FRESHWATER FORMATIONS. teeth of herbivorous animals in the same strata. Some of these animals are of such a vast and appall ing magnitude, as would exceed the sober measure of ordinary belief, if unsupported by the existence of well preserved parts of their skeletons, that leave no room for doubt. The beds which preserve the remains of land plants, and of animals living partly or entirely on dry land, are covered by others of marine origin, and by the vast formation of chalk, in aggregate thickness not less than six hundred feet, but in which the re mains of no land animal have as yet been discovered. Between the upper oolites described in the last chapter, and the lowest part of the chalk formation, the following beds maybe enumerated, commencing with the lowest. The Purbeck beds, so called from the Isle of Purbeck in Dorsetshire, where they were formerly quarried for a limestone denominated Purbeck marble. These beds consist of argillaceous lime stone, alternating with shale; the upper beds fur nished the best stone : the total thickness of all the strata is about three hundred feet; they abound in freshwater shells. The Iron-sand or Hastings-sand covers the Pur beck beds; it is chiefly a siliceous sand or loose sandstone, contain ing the brown oxide of iron, which generally gives the sandy beds a reddish brown colour : beds of clay and fullers-earth are occa sionally interstratified with the iron-sand. The oxide of iron, so abundantly disseminated through this sand, is often concreted into hard no dules and irregular veins, which project above the"], [323, "FOSSIL CROCODILES AND LIZARDS. 281 surface, wherever steep banks or escarpments of iron-sand occur. Silicified wood and wood coal are found in various parts of the sandstone belonging to this formation, both in England and on the Con tinent. A very deep section has been cut through the iron-sand, at Woburn in Bedfordshire, to level the great road from London to Northampton : a di stinct view of its mineral characters may there be observed ; and in the vicinity of Woburn there are pits made in the sand, to extract fullers-earth. But in Tilgate Forest in Sussex, the zoological cha racters of this formation are most remarkably dis played. Mr. Mantell has published a very inter esting account of the fossil remains which he dis covered there. They consist of petrified trunks of large plants, bearing a resemblance to the palms, arborescent ferns, and gigantic reeds of tropical climates; the shells of freshwater genera, as the freshwater muscle, the mya, cyrena, paludina, and Helix vivipara. Some remains of fish, and three di stinct species of turtles, have also been discovered ; and the bones, teeth, and scales of at least four gi gantic species of the lizard family ; namely, the crocodile, plesiosaurus, megalosaurus, and iguano don. The crocodilian remains are pronounced by Cu vier, to be almost identical with those of the fossil crocodile discovered at Caen in Normandy, which belongs to the genus gavial (the crocodile of the Ganges). The Plesiosaurus. \u2014 This animal has been no ticed, Chap. II. and X. The Megalosaurus. \u2014 The bones of this animal"], [324, "282 FOSSIL CROCODILES AND LIZARDS found at Tilgate are similar to those discovered by Mr. Buckland in the Stonesfield strata. The megalo saurus is supposed to approach nearer to the form ofthe Monitor* than to any other species of living lizard; but its size is so enormous, that Cuvier says, if we suppose it to have possessed the proportion of the monitor, it must have exceeded seventy feet in length. The Iguanodon. \u2014 A nondescript herbivorous reptile, which Cuvier pronounces to be the most ex traordinary animal yet discovered. Its structure ap proaches the nearest to that of the Iguana, a large species of lizard in the West Indies; its length was between sixty and seventy feet, which is double that of the largest living crocodile. But the great pecu liarity of the iguanodon, is the form of its teeth, which bear a striking resemblance to the grinders of herbivorous mammalia, being evidently intended for mastication, in which respect it differs from all living animals ofthe lizard family. The herbivorous amphibi\u00e6 gnaw off the vegetable productions on which they feed, but do notchewthem. \u2014 \"Since the vegetable remains,\" says Mr. Mantell, \"with which the teeth of the iguanodon are associated, consist principally of those tribes of plants that are fur nished with rough thick stems, and which were probably the principal food of the original animal, we may be permitted to remark, that this peculiar structure of the teeth seems to have been required, to enable the animal to accommodate itself to the * The Monitor \u2014 a species of lizards which are supposed to give warning of the approach of the crocodile by a hissing noise."], [325, "283 OF ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE. condition in which it was placed.\" \u2014 The iguanodon appears also to have possessed a horn, equal in size and not very different in form from the horn of the rhinoceros : in this respect, it resembles a living species of iguana, a native of St. Domingo. Mr. Mantell concludes his \" Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex,\" with the following interesting observations. \" We cannot leave this subject without offering a few general remarks on the probable condition of the country, through which the waters flowed that deposited the strata of Tilgate Forest ; and on the nature of its animal and vegetable productions. Whether it were an island or a continent, may not be determined ; but that it was diversified by hill and valley, and enjoyed a climate of a higher tem perature than any part of modern Europe, is more than probable. Several kinds of ferns appear to have constituted the immediate vegetable clothing of the soil : the elegant Hymenopteris psilotoides, which probably never attained a greater height than three or four feet, and the beautiful Pecopteris re ticulata, of still lesser growth, being abundant every where. It is easy to conceive what would be the appearance of the valleys and plains covered with these plants, from that presented by modern tracts, where the common ferns so generally prevail. But the loftier vegetables were so entirely distinct from any that are now known to exist in European coun tries, that we seek in vain for any thing at all analogous without the tropics. The forests oiCla thrari\u00e6 and Endogenit\u00e6, (the plants of which, like some of the recent arborescent ferns, probably at-"], [326, "284 THE GIGANTIC IGUANODON. tained a height of thirty or forty feet,) must have borne a much greater resemblance to those of tro pical regions, than to any that now occur in tem perate climates. That the soil was of a sandy nature on the hills and less elevated parts of the country, and argillaceous in the plains and marshes, may be inferred from the vegetable remains, and from the nature ofthe substances in which they are enclosed. Sand and clay every where prevail in the Hastings strata ; nor is it unworthy of remark, that the recent vegetables to which the fossil plants bear the greatest analogy, affect soils of this description. If we attempt to pourtray the animals of this ancient country, our description will possess more of the character of a romance, than of a legitimate deduction from esta blished facts. Turtles, of various kinds, must have been seen on the banks of its rivers or lakes, and groups of enormous crocodiles basking in the fens and shallows.\" \" The gigantic Megalosaurus, and yet more gi gantic Iguanodon, to whom the groves of palms and arborescent ferns would be mere beds of reeds, must have been of such prodigious magnitude, that the existing animal creation presents us with no fit ob jects of comparison. Imagine an animal of the lizard tribe, three or four times as large as the largest crocodile, having jaws, with teeth equal in size to the incisors of the rhinoceros, and crested with horns ; \u2014 such a creature must have been the iguanodon ! Nor were the inhabitants of the waters much less wonderful; witness the plesiosaurus, which only required wings to be a flying dragon ; the fishes resembling Siluri, Balist\u0153, &c.\""], [327, "285 GREENSAND. The parts ofEngland where the iron-sand covers a considerable extent of surface, are the counties of Kent, Sussex, and Bedfordshire. In France it is denominated gres ferrugineux. The Weald-clay, so called from being first no ticed in the Wealds of Kent, varies in its quality from a dark tenacious clay, to a gray calcareous marie. Some of the beds consist of argillaceous limestone, filled with univalve shells of the genus Vivipara, a freshwater shell. This limestone, called Petworth or Sussex marble, closely resembles the Purbeck marble before described. In Kent, the Weald-clay is three hundred feetthick,butitdoesnot appear to be an extensive bed, as it grows thinner in the adjacent counties, and has not been traced be yond them. Here terminates the freshwater forma tion below chalk, comprising the Purbeck beds, the Hastings- or iron-sands, and the Weald-clay, with their associated beds of marie and limestone. Whe ther the whole series were deposited in a freshwater lake, or whether the remains of freshwater plants and animals were carried down by rivers, and left in estuaries at their mouths, perhaps future inves tigation may determine. Whatever was the con dition of this part of the globe, when the strata with freshwater remains were formed, we have certain proof, that it was again covered by a very deep sea, in which all the thick beds of chalk and chalk marie were deposited, and in which the nu merous tribes of marine animals lived and flourished, that have left their exuvi\u00e6 in the different parts of that great calcareous formation. Green-sand. \u2014 This bed, which is of considerable"], [328, "286 GREEN-SAND. thickness, is interposed between the Weald-clay and the chalk, and is to be distinguished from the iron sand below both, by its mineral and zoological cha racters*. The green-sand might perhaps be pro perly classed as a lower member of the chalk forma tion, as it accompanies chalk, both in England and on the continent of Europe ; and the lower beds of chalk or chalk marie pass gradually into the green sand, by a close intermixture with it, and have, on account of their greenish or yellowish colour, been denominated Glauconie crayeuse and Craie chlo ritee, by the French. Green-sand has received its English name from its intermixture with particles of green earth ; it is very variable in its mineral characters, being some times found composed of loose siliceous sand ; in other situations, it forms sandstone cemented by calcareous earth ; it abounds in siliceous concre tions, which vary from an opaque blueish white chert or hornstone, to flint and chalcedony. The geodes found in the green-sand near Sidmouth, are composed of opaque chert on the outside, and con tain within, mammillated concretions of beautiful chalcedony, and occasionally perfect minute rock crystals. Some of the sandy concretions near Sid mouth have a beautiful green colour, which I found to proceed from green sulphate of iron f. * The fossils in the Weald-clay of Tilgate Forest, according to Mr. Mantell, are the Cypris faba, Palludin\u00e6, Cyren\u00e6, scales of fishes, and Vivipar\u00e6 paludin\u00e6. \u25a0J\" On the east of Sidmouth, immediately above the town, I observed green-sand intermixed with black particles, which I ascertained to be the black oxide of manganese."], [329, "FOSSILS IN GREEN-SAND. 287 The fossils in the green-sand are very numerous, and in high preservation : they consist chiefly of various species of chambered and unchambered univalve shells, and of bivalve shells and echini; few remains of vertebrated animals have been found in any part of the beds. Amidst the great variety of fossil species, it would be difficult to select any one which is decidedly characteristic of this forma tion ; but where several species are associated in the green-sand in different situations, they may serve collectively to identify it in remote countries. M. A. Brongniart has thus attempted to identify the strata near the Perte de Rhone on the confines of Savoy, with the green-sand or chalk marie in the north of France and in England, in an interesting memoir entitled Sur les Characteres Zoologiques des Formations, publ. 1822 *. There is one negative character which the fossils in the green-sand afford ; the echini of the genus Spatangus, which are common in chalk, and in the green-sand, have not been discovered in any lower formation. In the western part of England, the fossils in green-sand are often converted into chal cedony. Below the green-sand, in the county of Sussex, there is a stratum of clay, called gait, under which there is a ferruginous sand, passing in the lower part into green-sand; this is sometimes called Shanklin-sand, and sometimes the lower green-sand. According to Mr. Mantell, it contains casts of the * Near the Perte de Rhone, in the bed of the river Valteline, I discovered strata bearing a great resemblance to the lower English chalk."], [330, "288 CHALK trigoni\u00e6, patella?, modiol\u00e6, &c. The gait or Folk stone marie, contains belemnites, ammonites, and nautilites, with remains of fishes and crabs. The green-sand formation is covered by chalk; but in some parts of England it extends beyond the chalk, and covers the subjacent strata at a con siderable distance from the chalk formation. The French chemist M. Berthier, discovered that the green particles in the strata under and over chalk, are the siliciate of iron. The general name given by the French to the green-sand formation, is gres et sables verts. Chalk. \u2014 This rock extends through many ofthe eastern and southern counties in England ; it may be traced with little interruption from Yorkshire into Kent, and from Kent into Dorsetshire. Chalk is a stone so well known in England, as to require but little description. Its prevailing colour is white, but some of the lower beds incline to gray ; it has an earthy texture, and is generally so soft as to yield to the nail, though some of the lower beds are sufficiently hard to be employed for building-stone. The average thickness of the chalk strata may be estimated at from six hundred to eight hundred feet. The upper beds contain numerous nodules and short irregular veins of flint ; the lower chalk contains fewer flints, and is generally hard : below this, there occur beds of soft chalk, called chalk marie. In France the beds of chalk seldom attain the thickness which they have in England. The French divide the chalk formation into the lowest or chalk marie, with green particles, craie chloritee, or glauconie crayeuse ; the middle or coarse chalk"], [331, "289 CHALK is of a grayish colour and intermixed with sand ; it contains whitish chert (craie grossiere or craie tufeau); the upper or white chalk (craie blanche), which contains nodules of common flint. M. Humboldt, after noticing the great inter mixture of the sandy calcareous and argillaceous beds, in the formations below chalk, and which is greatly increased in the tertiary strata above chalk, observes, \" that nature seems to have relented in her tendency to form complex mixtures when chalk was deposited.\" In the chalk formation, we find an assemblage of calcareous strata, composed of car bonate of lime, with very little intermixture of the other earths, and without any alternation with argil laceous or siliceous strata. Chalk is not, however, absolutely pure ; for beside the nodules and veins of flint that occur in it, but which bear no sensible pro portion to the whole mass, some of the strata con tain an intermixture with siliceous sand, and in other strata, calcareous earth is combined with magnesia. In some of the chalk strata in France, the magnesia exceeds ten per cent, and I believe many of the English chalk strata contain as great a proportion of magnesian earth. Chalk which contains a notable portion of mag nesia, may generally be known by an appearance of dendritical spotted delineations on the surface of the natural partings, and by minute black spots, like grains of gunpowder, in the substance of the chalk. The stratification of chalk is seldom so distinct as in many other calcareous formations : this may be partly owing to the softness of the beds, which v"], [332, "290 FLINTS IN THE UPPER appear to have yielded to pressure; and to the same cause we may probably ascribe the fractured state ofthe nodules of flint in chalk, which often appear whole, when they are imbedded in the rock, but when taken out, are found to be shivered into in numerable angular fragments. The nodules of flint, are commonly arranged in pretty regular layers in the chalk ; they occur in detached con cretions of various shapes and sizes : some of them are believed to be the casts of spongiform zoo phytes; and this is rendered more probable, by the frequent occurrence of fossil echini in chalk, in which the internal part is filled with flint, and forms a perfect cast of the animal. The constant occurrence of flint in the upper chalk, and the apparent conversion of animal re mains into flint, has formerly given rise to much speculation respecting the origin of flint, and it was at one time maintained, that flint and chalk are convertible or capable of undergoing a mutual transmutation : but whatever hidden processes there may be in the great laboratory of the earth, by which all mineral substances, held to be elementary by the chemist, may be resolved into original ele ments still more simple, and afterwards recom pounded into other substances, we have no reason to mount so high in our speculations, respecting the origin of flint. Flint is siliceous earth nearly pure, and we find the same earth under different forms combined with almost all calcareous rocks in a greater or lesser proportion. Primitive limestone is often much intermixed"], [333, "CHALK 291 with siliceous earth. Transition limestone occasion ally contains rock-crystals imbedded in the mass : this is not unfrequently the case in some of the transition limestones of Derbyshire. The magnesian limestones and oolites, are also very commonly in termixed with siliceous grains, and often alternate with strata that are more or less siliceous : hence we need not be surprised to find siliceous earth in chalk, either combined with calcareous earth, or separated in distinct concretions. When the cavi ties of a sponge or crustaceous animal admitted the siliceous earth to enter, it appears to have been infiltered from the chalk, in the same manner as the nodules of chalcedony, have been infiltered into the cavities of lava or basalt. Between chal cedony and flint there is a near resemblance, they are only different modes of the same substance, and the flint nodules in the western counties of England, are frequently chalcedonic. The hardest rocks and stones are permeable to water; and flint when first got out of the chalk is easily fractured, and the fractured surface is found covered with moisture. The fossils found in chalk are the remains of marine animals. The Echini, of which there are various species, are so numerous that they are con sidered as characteristic of this formation, and some are peculiar to it, particularly the helmet-shaped echinus (ananchytes). Ammonites of a different species from those in the lower strata are occasionally found in chalk, and also belemnites and scaphites. There are but few spiral univalve shells in this formation, which per haps may confirm the opinion before stated, that v2"], [334, "292 FOSSILS IN the animals of this class were not the inhabitants of deep seas. Of bivalve shells there are many species ; and the remains of zoophytes, particularly of sponges and alcyonia, are numerous. The remains of vertebrated animals are rare ; they consist chiefly of the teeth, palates, vertebr\u00e6, and scales of fishes. The great preservation in which some of the most delicate of these remains are frequently found, render it probable, that chalk was deposited in a deep and tranquil sea. Balls of iron pyrites with a radiated diverging structure, are frequently found in chalk ; and the large spines of echini, of the genus Cidaris, are found converted into pyrites in the chalk-pits near Dorking; they resemble small fungi with a stalk and rounded head. All the fossils in chalk are regarded as belonging to species now extinct, and several of them belong to extinct genera. Mr. Parkinson says that \"hardly a single fossil has been found in the lower chalk, which has been met with in the upper or in any other stratum.\" Chalk extends along the northern coast of France opposite the chalk cliffs of En gland, of which it was no doubt a continuous forma tion : it extends also far into the interior of France, and may be traced through the Netherlands and part of Germany, into Poland, and to the Island of Rugen in the Baltic, and into Sweden. The lower part of the chalk formation may also be traced to the calcareous ranges of the Alps. We have no precise information respecting the extent of chalk in Asia : it has been said, but with what truth I know not, that Jerusalem is built upon chalk. Humboldt discovered no chalk in South America,"], [335, "CHALK. 293 nor has it been hitherto found in any part of the United States. Chalk is the uppermost ofthe strata classed as secondary ; it was till very lately regarded as the most recent of rock-formations, except the volcanic. Between the epoch when chalk was deposited, and the period when it was covered with the ter tiary strata, there appears to have been a consi derable interval, during which the surface of the extensive mass of chalk, was in many situations deeply furrowed, and excavated into valleys and basins, before a new series of strata were deposited upon it, destined to support a new creation of ani mals of a superior class, altogether different from those which have left their remains in the subjacent strata."], [336, "294 CHAPTER XIV.

It is now however disco vered, that the tertiary formations are very widely spread over the present islands and continents, and are of considerable thickness. The most remarkable discovery that has been made respecting the tertiary deposits is, that many"], [337, "295 TERTIARY STRATA. of them contain the bones of mammiferous qua drupeds, as perfect in their organization as any of the existing species of land quadrupeds, but most of them belonging to genera or species that are extinct. The tertiary strata are further remarkable, for pre senting the frequent alternation of beds containing the remains of marine animals, with other beds that contain the bones of land animals, or freshwater shells. It appears that the tertiary strata were chiefly formed in detached inland seas, or lakes ; hence there is a considerable diversity in the thick ness, number and quality of the beds, in different districts or countries. During the deposition and consolidation of the upper secondary strata, the crust of the globe ap pears to have remained in a quiescent state, and to have experienced few violent concussions and de rangements from internal causes. Those faults and dykes which have bent, contorted, or broken the lower strata, rarely extend to the upper secondary strata ; for we find the latter arranged horizontally over them, or dipping with a very slight degree of inclination. Where the upper secondary strata have experienced any considerable disturbing force, it appears to have operated at a comparatively re cent period, after the deposition of the tertiary strata ; for they are frequently raised or depressed together, as we have before noticed in the Alps. In our own island, we have instances of partial subsidences of the upper secondary and tertiary strata, which however are few and of very limited extent. Though in England and the northern parts of"], [338, "296 TERTIARY STRATA Europe, few internal disturbing causes have acted intensely or extensively on the crust of the globe, after the deposition of the upper secondary, and the tertiary strata, we have clear indications of an ex ternal force, which has torn away considerable portions of them, and transported their ruins into distant countries, or into the ocean. Many of these strata have evidently once extended beyond their present limits; and some ofthe tertiary strata have been so completely destroyed in many situations, that we can only infer their former existence, by a few remaining detached portions. In France, the tertiary strata are more widely spread, and many of them more fully developed, than in England : it is indeed scarcely possible to ima gine a more distinct display of the series of strata in any class of rocks, than is presented close to the very gates of Paris. In a capital so distinguished for scientific investigation, and possessing so many able and acute observers, it does indeed seem truly extraordinary, that the strata with which they were surrounded, should never have been properly ex amined until so recent a period, as the early part of the present century. What is daily before our eyes seldom excites attention, or is deemed deserving of much notice ; but there was another cause which long prevented the philosophers of Paris from ob serving the remarkable objects around them. Cap tivated with the generalizations of Werner, who it was firmly believed had unlocked all the hidden mysteries of Geology, and comprised in his system, all the different formations that composed the crust of the globe, they saw before them a series of strata"], [339, "297 NEAR PARIS. which had no agreement with any part of the Wer nerian classification ; hence they could not avoid the painful persuasion, either that the system of Werner was incomplete, or that they were unable to apply it properly. To avoid an acknowledgment so little satisfactory, the geologists of Paris averted their attention and that of their pupils from nearer objects, and directed them to the mountains of Germany or Switzerland. Had hot another sci ence, comparative anatomy, come to the aid of geo logy, we might yet have remained unacquainted with the tertiary strata around Paris. At length, the number of skeletons of strange and unknown animals discovered in some of the strata, forcibly attracted the notice of that distinguished naturalist Cuvier, and it was resolved to investigate atten tively the geology ofthe whole district. M.A.Brong niart was associated with Cuvier in the investiga tion, and in 1811 the result of their labours and observations was given in a work entitled Essaisur la Geographie Mineralogique des Environs de Paris, \u2014 the most luminous and interesting exposi tion of local geology ever presented to the world ; and from this period we may date the first accurate knowledge of the tertiary strata. The following extract from the Essay of Messrs. Cuvier and Brongniart, presents a general view of the arrangement of the strata round Paris. \" The country in which the capital of France is situated is perhaps the most remarkable that has yet been observed, both from the succession of different soils of which it is formed, and from the extraordi-"], [340, "298 TERTIARY STRATA nary organic remains which it contains. Millions of marine shells, which alternate regularly with freshwater shells, compose the principal mass. Bones of land animals, of which the genera are entirely unknown, are found in certain parts ; other bones remarkable for their vast size, and of which some of similar genera (quelques congeneres) exist only in distant countries, are found scattered in the upper beds. A marked character ofa great irrup tion from the south-east is impressed on the summits (caps), and in the direction of the principal hills. In one word, no country can afford more instruction respecting the last revolutions which have termi nated the formation of the present continents.\" Though chalk is the foundation rock of the country for a considerable extent round Paris, it only rises to the surface in a few situations, being covered by the other strata in the following order, beginning with the lowest stratum above chalk. 1.

Each of the above divisions of the tertiary strata in the Paris basin, admits of numerous subdivisions; but it is not the object of the present volume to enter into the minute details of local geology, but to present a view of the principal formations that occur in various countries. Many of the beds in the Paris basin are not found elsewhere, and there fore cannot be taken as types of the whole class; and the lower bed called the plastic clay, is but very imperfectly developed near Paris. In attempting to generalize the tertiary formations, a difficulty presents itself, if we are to class them by their zoological characters; for some of the formations, which contain exclusively the remains of marine ani mals in certain situations, contain in other situations river or lake shells, with wood and the bones of land animals. It is therefore probable, that while the waters in one lake or basin might be saline, those in another lake might be fresh ; and two cotempo raneous formations may hence contain very dif ferent organic remains.

The plastic clay, and London clay, with the various associated beds of sand, may properly be regarded as one formation, of which the plastic clay is the lowest member resting on chalk. Near Paris this is a very thin bed, but in the south of France it acquires a great degree of thickness, and appears to comprise the upper argillaceous beds, or what we call the London clay : it is remarkable for the vegetable fossils and beds of lignite which it frequently but not invariably contains. In England, in the lower beds of this formation, there are found beds of imperfect wood coal ; but both the plas tic clay, and the London clay, contain shells and other remains of marine animals ; whereas on the Continent, beside the great quantities of fossil wood and wood coal found in the same argillaceous beds, there are numerous remains of freshwater shells, which render their title to be denominated marine formations more than doubtful. The beds of sand are sometimes of considerable thickness. By many geologists it is maintained, that the beds of soft sandstone (called molasse), and of sandstone con glomerate (called nagel flue in Switzerland), be long to this part of the tertiary formations, That"], [343, "301 IN ENGLANn. some of these beds may be tertiary I will not deny; but I am fully convinced, that many beds of mo lasse in Savoy are covered by the Jura limestone and oolites, having repeatedly seen them in con tact, and got specimens from each bed at the line of junction*. The bones of horses, with the tooth of an ele phant, have been found in a bed of unctuous clay * As the opinions of geologists have been much divided respect ing the molasse, or soft sandstone of Switzerland and Savoy, I shall here insert some observations upon it, given in the first volume of my Travels in the Tarentaise. I must first remark, that almost all the sandstone strata in these countries possess nearly the same character of minute angular fragments ce mented by calcareous earth ; and if the term molasse be applied to all of them, molasse is of very different ages, like the sand stone in the English strata. In the chapter on the destruction of rocks, I shall advert to the strata of molasse again ; they have hitherto received much less attention than their magnitude and importance, as constituent parts of the outer ranges of the Alps, require. \" The outer calcareous mountains on the western side of Savoy, all rest upon an immense formation of soft sandstone, (molasse), and are interstratified with it ; and so far from this sandstone being more recent than the limestone (as Saussure supposed), it constitutes a considerable part of the bulk of these mountains, that are called calcareous. In the Valley of les Echelles, the immediate junction of the limestone with the sand stone may be seen soon after entering the valley from the arch way. This vast wall of limestone, nearly one thousand feet in thickness, rests upon a mass of sandstone of unknown depth: there is very little dip where the first junction is seen, but about a mile below, you meet with the limestone again in conjunction with the sandstone, and thrown into a vertical position. The workmen that I met with near the mouth of the gallery, said they always found sandstone below the limestone, and they con-"], [344, "302 BONES OF LARGE QUADRUPEOS near Margate ; but as the clay is superficial, it may be a diluvial formation.

The sandstone, or molasse, on which the limestone in this part of Savoy reposes, or which is subordinate to the limestone, is composed of smallish grains of quartz and chlorite, pretty equally mixed. In the sandstone of les Echelles, which I got from its junction with the limestone, there were some par ticles of rose quartz and mica. It scratched glass strongly when rubbed upon it ; but when put into a. dilute muriatic acid, it effervesced violently, and became friable, owing to the solution of the calcareous cement by which it appears, from this expe riment, to be agglutinated. The molasse, which is interstra tified with limestone and associated with coal on the lake of Annecy, also effervesced ; but the particles being smaller, it appeared nearly homogeneous when examined without a lens. It has been recently stated, that the molasse of the Alps belongs to the same formation as the sandstone above chalk near Paris. There may be sandstone of that formation in the canton of Berne ; but the molasse or sandstone in this part of Savoy, I am well convinced, is a member of formations that are lower than chalk. It is possible, however, that beds of this molasse may have been worn down during the great destruction of the strata, that has evidently taken place since they were deposited, and from the. debris of this sandstone, upper beds may have been formed covering strata that are above chalk. The molasse which covers the bones and teeth of the mastodon and other large mammalia near Alpnach, nearly resembles that in tms part of Savoy ; but the particles are smaller, and more intimately mixed.\" \u2014 P, 176."], [345, "303 IN TERTIARY STRATA. But we have yet no decisive proof, that the lig nite of Alpnach does not belong to the oolitic series, as the beds of limestone over it, resemble the Jura limestone : should this ultimately prove to be the fact, we should have another instance, like that of Stonesfield, of the bones of mammiferous animals occurring in strata below chalk *. In France near d'Auteuil and south of the Dor dogne, according to Humboldt, bones of vertebrated land animals are found in a formation resting on chalk, analogous to the plastic clay. Baron Cuvier says, however, that he has not discovered the bones of land quadrupeds in any strata below the calcaire grossier which covers the plastic clay. But neither the plastic clay nor the gypsum beds of Paris, can be taken as types of the tertiary strata in other countries. The London clay is placed over the plastic clay and sand, and is in fact an upper member of the great arenaceous and argillaceous formation, that covers chalk. Some geologists attempt to identify the London clay with the beds of calcaire grossier, and of gypsum, in the Paris basin, but their mi neral characters are essentially different. The London clay is composed of dark blue or brown argillaceous beds, suitable for brick earth; and the small quantity of calcareous earth or of selenite that sometimes occurs in it, no more identifies itwith the light limestone strata of the calcaire grossier, * Specimens of the strata above the coal of Alpnach were presented me by Professor Meissner of Berne, and are described in the 2d volume of my Travels, p. 167."], [346, "304 LONDON CLAY, PLASTIC CLAY. or the thick beds of gypsum in the Paris basin, than the wooden doors with iron nails of St. Paul's ca thedral, would identify the stone of that building, with the wood in the shipping in the Thames. By attempting to unite things essentially different, in order to force an agreement with artificial classisi cations, we mystify what is clear and simple, and retard the progress of knowledge. The uppermost bed of the London clay is of a reddish brown colour, and is more arenaceous than the lower beds ; the colour of the lower beds varies from a blueish lead colour, to a blackish brown ; they are often considerably indurated, and have somewhat of a slaty structure. The thickness of the London clay varies from one hundred to four hundred feet or more ; this variable thickness is occasioned by the upper beds which form the sur face ofthe land in the Vale of Thames, having been more excavated in some parts than in others. As the London clay and plastic clay and sand, taken together, equal or exceed in thickness the beds of plastic clay, calcaire grossier, and gypsum in the Paris basin, the London clay may properly be regarded not as identical with the calcaire gros sier and gypsum, but as their geological equiva lent. While the beds of limestone and gypsum were depositing in the Paris basin, the London clay might be deposited in the London basin; and this may explain why many species of marine shells in the London clay, are similar to those found in the calcaire grossier : but we no where discover the astonishing variety of species, that occur in some of the strata of the calcaire grossier ; nor have any"], [347, "305 SECTION OF THE VALE OF THAMES. bones of land quadrupeds, similar to those in the Paris basin, been found in the London clay. The two sides of the trough or basin in which the Lon don clay and plastic clay were deposited, are formed on the north, by the range of chalk hills in Hert fordshire and the adjacent counties, and on the south, by the range of chalk hills in Surrey and Kent. The relative geological position of the chalk, the plastic clay and sand, immediately upon it, and the upper bed of London clay covering the Vale of Thames, is represented in a small section at the bottom of the Map ofEngland. Plate 6.

From this small section, the geological student may form some idea of the devastating effects of mighty inunda tions, which have swept over the surface of the globe, and carried away considerable portions of the upper beds. The marine sandstone d. d. which forms isolated caps on several of the hills in the Vale of Thames, was doubtless part of one continuous bed which has been excavated with a portion of the subjacent London clay ; such excavations and denudations, are common phenomena in almost every country.

Re- mains of turtles and crocodiles have been dug out of this clay at Highgate and Islington. The teeth and tusks of elephants have been discovered in many situations, in what is supposed to have been London clay, but which may have been a covering of diluvial clay, for the patches of diluvial gravel that are spread over many parts of the Vale of Thames, frequently contain the remains of ele- phants *. Ammonites and belemnites, and many genera of testaceous animals, that have left their remains in chalk and the lower strata, appear to have been extinct before the deposition of the Lon- don clay. Nautilites are however found in it, simi- lar to the species inhabiting the Indian Ocean, and bivalve and univalve shells are so numerous, that it would be difficult to select any particular species, as peculiarly characteristic of this formation. The shells mostly belong to genera inhabiting our pre- sent seas ; yet slight variations of form may some times be perceived, which have induced naturalists to regard them as distinct from living species. We should however bear in mind, that we know little or nothing respecting the habits of testaceous ani mals, or the changes produced in the shell, by dif ference of age or situation ; therefore, to pronounce that shells are of different species, from those in the * In clearing away the bed of gravel on the north side of the Regent's Park, the tusks of elephants were found, but in a mouldering state, in 1818."], [349, "SPRINGS OF PURE WATER. 307 present seas, on account of some slight variation of form, is scarcely more wise, than it would be to class individual men as different species, on account of the different forms of their noses. Cabinet phi losophers however, who, except for a few weeks in summer, rarely travel beyond their museums, may sometimes attach more importance to the minute difference of form in a fossil shell, than to the struc ture of a range of mountains. The springs that rise in the London clay, are generally impregnated with sulphate of iron and sulphate of lime, and some of the springs contain sulphate of magnesia; the quality of the water, however, varies much in different situations, and at different depths. To obtain soft water, it is ne cessary to bore or sink through the London clay to the sand above the chalk, and sometimes into the chalk itself*. The London clay, and the under beds have been perforated to the depth of three or four hundred feet in some situations, before good * At the village of Wilsden, three miles north-west of Lon. don, the boring for water was made two hundred and eighty feet into the clay, and seventy-five feet below it into the chalk, when the water immediately rose to within thirty-five feet of the sur face. Chalk rocks, and other calcareous rocks in which the strata are divided by fissures that are not filled with clay, always contain water in the fissures when the strata dip under the sur face of the ground, or when they are covered by argillaceous beds. This is also the case with coal strata, and the presence of water is necessary to keep the coal in good condition. If the water be entirely drained from a bed of coal a considerable time before it is worked, the quality of the coal is much deteriorated. This may be occasioned, by air penetrating the fissures and pro moting the decomposition of pyrites in the coal. X 2"], [350, "308 SPRINGS OF PURE WATER. water could be obtained; when the stratum is pierced which holds the best water, it rises almost immediately, and sometimes overflows the surface. This admits of an easy explanation by referring to the section of the Vale of Thames. Plate 6. The water which enters the edges of the porous strata, say at x. x. descends to the lowest part of the trough or basin, and when perforated would rise to near the level of x. x. were the strata deposited in a basin, the edges of which rose on each side from the bottom of the Vale of Thames ; but the strata are deposited in a longitudinal trough between the chalk hills of Hertfordshire and Surrey, so that the river Thames cuts through the porous edges of the strata below Greenwich, and the water being there let out, it can seldom rise much above the high water mark. Were it not for this, we might have natural jets d'eau of considerable height and magni tude in all the squares of London, to cool and re fresh the air during the summer months, and sup ply the inhabitants in the vicinity with salubrious water. In order to preserve the water pure, that is obtained from chalk or the sand over chalk, it is necessary to line the inside of wells, or to put down tubes, to prevent the water from the London clay, intermixing with the pure water from below. Le calcaire grossier, or coarse limestone of Paris, is deposited upon the plastic clay, as the latter is upon the subjacent chalk : between the plastic clay, however, and the calcaire grossier, there is a bed of sand, but geologists are not determined, to which of the two formations it belongs. The calcaire grossier differs in its quality in the different beds,"], [351, "PARIS LIMESTONE. 309 but it may be described generally as a yellowish earthy limestone, which bears some resemblance to Portland stone in its fracture, texture, and colour; but it is not oolitic. The strata of limestone alter nate with argillaceous marie and shale, and with calcareous marie. The lowest bed of calcaire grossier is soft, and much intermixed with green particles and sand; it contains a great number of the fossils, called nummulites, on account of their being flat and round, and resembling in shape a small coin. The shells in this bed are in high preservation. In the beds immediately above, called the middle beds, there are a prodigious number of marine shells, and also the stems and impressions of leaves of plants, that are not marine. In the lowest and middle beds of the calcaire grossier, no less than six hun dred different species of shells are found. In the upper part of the calcaire grossier, the strata are several feet thick,-and yield a hard coarse grained and durable limestone ; it is from these strata that the best building-stone is procured. It is often nearly filled with shells of the genus ceri thium, and has hence been sometimes called calcaire a cerites. Between the strata of building-stone, there often occur thin strata of flint or chert ; in some parts these siliceous strata enlarge into thick beds of chert (silex come), or into beds of sandstone con taining marine shells ; in the beds of this sand stone at Pierrelaie, freshwater shells have been discovered, mixed with numerous marine shells."], [352, "310 PARIS LIMESTONE. The total thickness of the beds of calcaire grossier near Paris, is about ninety feet. No beds of limestone resembling the calcaire grossier of Paris, are found in the tertiary strata of England. The calcaire grossier in the depart ments of La Dordogne and La Gironde and other parts of France, presents a considerable difference from that in the Paris basin. In Hungary, exten sive strata of the calcaire grossier have been de scribed by M. Beudant ; they are in every respect analogous to the strata in the Paris basin, both in their mineral and zoological characters. The lower beds also are intermixed with shelly sand, and green particles, which bear a close resemblance to the shelly depositions in the plain of Lombardy. M. Humboldt thinks he discovered a formation similar to the calcaire grossier in some parts of South America. Calcaire siliceux is composed of limestone, some times gray and compact, and sometimes tender and white : it is penetrated by silex in every direction, and in all its parts ; according to M. Brongniart, the calcaire siliceux occupies the place of the calcaire grossier; others regard it as an upper formation. Some of the beds of the calcaire siliceux furnish mill-stones, and contain river shells. In this bed, the siliciate of magnesia was discovered by M. Brongniart. The siliceous infiltrations sometimes form plates of chalcedony and mammillated con cretions of chalcedonic chert, coloured red, violet, and brown. Gypseous Marie and Gypsum. \u2014 This remarkable"], [353, "PARIS GYPSUM. 311 formation occurs in detached hills along the course ofthe rivers Marne and the Seine; it is supposed to have originally extended as one continuous bed from east to west, twenty-five leagues in length and eight in breadth ; its greatest thickness is about two hundred feet. The gypsum formation consists of alternating beds of gypsum and argillaceous and calcareous marie, which are regularly arranged, and preserve the same order of succession wherever they have been examined. The gypsum forms three distinct masses. The lowest consists of thin strata of gyp sum containing crystals of selenite, which alternate with strata of solid calcareous marie, and with ar gillaceous shale. The middle is like the lowest mass, except that the strata of gypsum are thicker, and the beds of marie are not so numerous ; it is chiefly in this mass that fossil fish are found. The uppermost mass is the most remarkable and impor tant of all, it is in some parts more than seventy feet thick ; there are but few beds of marie in it ; the lower strata in this mass have a prismatic or co lumnar structure : the gypsum is pure and finely granular; it has a light yellowish brown colour, which might perhaps more properly be called a dirty white. In this upper mass of gypsum the skeletons and scattered bones of birds and unknown quadrupeds are discovered ; sometimes they are found in the solid gypsum, and sometimes in the marie that separates the beds. Remains of turtles and crocodiles have also been found in the same strata. It is to the indefatigable and enlightened labours of Baron Cuvier that we are indebted for a"], [354, "312 BONES OF QUADRUPEDS knowledge of the different genera of remarkable land quadrupeds, belongingto a former world, found in the gypsum quarries ; they differ from any genera of living animals. These land quadrupeds were herbivorous, they belong to the order which Cuvier has denominated Pachydermata or thick-skinned non-ruminant animals. One of the genera called Pal\u0153olherium (or ancient animal), appears to bear some relation to the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and horse, and in some respects to the pig and the camel. Of this genus there are eleven or twelve species ; five of them have been found in the Paris gypsum. The largest was of the size of a horse, but its form was heavy, and its legs thick and short ; its grinders resemble those of the rhinoceros, and the daman*; it had six incisive, and two canine teeth like the tapir, and like that animal, had a short fleshy trunk: it had three toes on each foot, and is supposed to have inhabited marshy ground, and to have lived on the roots and stems of succulent marsh plants. One of the species, however, possessed the size and the light figure of the antelope, and is supposed to have browsed on aromatic plants, or the buds of young trees in dry situations, like other light herbi vorous animals. Probably, says Cuvier, it was a timid animal with large moveable ears like those of the deer, which could apprise it of the least danger : doubtless its skin was covered with short hair ; and * An African quadruped, the size of a rabbit, but closely re sembling the rhinoceros."], [355, "IN PARIS GYPSUM. 313 we only want to know its colour, in order to paint it as it formerly lived in the country, where, after so many ages, its bones have been dug up. One species of the pal\u00e6otherium was not larger than a hare. The Anoplotherium, or animal without defensive teeth, has only been found in the gypsum quarries near Paris. It has two very distinctive characters: the feet have only two toes, which are separated the whole length of the foot ; the teeth, of which there are six incisive in each jaw, a canine tooth of the same height, and six molares or grinders, all form a continued series without any interval, which is the case with no other known quadruped. The most common species is of the height of a boar, but much longer. There are remains of other animals, in the same quarries, allied to the anoplotherium, but which differ in the form of their teeth. The bones of six species of birds have been discovered in these quarries, and also the remains of a few carnivorous animals allied to the dog and the weasel. It is remarkable, that in the middle of the gypsum formation, and throughout the greater part of it, we find the remains of land animals and of fresh water fish and shells ; but near its upper and lower limits, both in the gypsum and the marie, the fossils are those of marine animals. A bed of green marie, which may be very distinctly traced near the termination of the upper mass of gypsum, separates the freshwater from the sea shells; and in the lower part of the gypsum formation, marine shells are found in the gypsum itself. It may be useful to those strangers who visit"], [356, "314 CONDITION OF THE BONES, Montmartre for the first time, to state, that this thin green bed, which can be distinctly seen and traced, may serve them as a key to the geology of the place ; as it separates all the lower marine and freshwater formations from the upper. The gypsum of the Paris basin was probably de posited in an extensive lake, on the borders of which the land animals, whose remains are discovered in it, flourished and perished. Some of them appear to be formed for swimming or living much in the water, like the otter or water-rat. Whether the water in this lake was salt or fresh is by no means certain, though M. Brongniart thinks that a single freshwater shell found in the gypsum would decide the question : but this opinion, however high the authority of so distinguished a naturalist and geo logist may be, cannot I conceive be maintained; for in some of the beds, we meet with a mixture of ma rine and freshwater shells, \u2014 and in this case who shall determine, whether such beds are of marine or freshwater origin ? The intermixture of shells clearly shows, that they have been transported from their native situations, or that marine and fresh water molusc\u00e6 may live in the same estuary or lake, if the water be brackish, which is confirmed by recent observations and experiments. The fossil bones found in the gypsum quarries near Paris, are light and porous, and appear to have been scarcely penetrated by gypsum : this is very remarkable; for if we suppose the gypsum to have been held in solution by water, like the sulphate of lime in recent springs, it seems extraordinary that it should not have penetrated into the pores ofthe"], [357, "315 AND INFERENCES. bones. I am not aware that the circumstance has before been noticed by geologists, but I think the state of the bones proves, that they were rapidly enveloped by the gypsum, before the animal matter in the pores was decomposed, and also that the gypsum was speedily consolidated. The same ob servation would apply to the bones of land animals I found in the freshwater limestone, under the vol canic mountain of Gergovia in Auvergne; the state of these bones was similar to those in the Paris gypsum. Baron Cuvier was the first naturalist who applied the knowledge of comparative anatomy, to ascertain the forms of vertebrated fossil animals. The pub lication of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles, may be regarded as an epoch in geology: since that time many other important discoveries respect ing fossil quadrupeds have been made. It will not therefore be deemed irrelevant to our subject, to insert the very interesting account he has given of his own feelings, when he first became able to ar range the bones of each genus and species of un known animals, found in the gypsum quarries near Paris. \" When the sight of some bones of the bear and the elephant, twelve years ago inspired me with the idea of applying the general laws of compara tive anatomy, to the reconstruction and the discovery of fossil species ; when I began to perceive that these species were not perfectly represented by those of our day which resembled them the most; \u2014 I did not suspect, that I was every day treading upon a soil, filled with remains more extraordinary than"], [358, "316 REFLECTIONS OF CUVIER any that I had yet seen; nor that I was destined to bring to light whole genera of animals, unknown to the present world, and buried for incalculable ages at vast depths under the earth. It was to Mr. Veurin that I owe the first indications of these bones furnished by our quarries : some fragments which he brought me one day, having struck me with astonishment, I made inquiries respecting the persons to whom this industrious collector had sent any formerly : what I saw in these collections, served to excite my hopes and increase my curiosity. Causing search to be made at that time for such bones in all the quarries, and offering rewards to arouse the attention of the workmen, I collected a greater number than any person who had preceded me. After some years I was sufficiently rich in materials to have nothing further to desire ; but it was otherwise with respect to their arrangement and the construction ofthe skeletons, which alone could conduct me to a just knowledge of the species. From the first moment I perceived, that there were many different species in our quarries ; and soon afterwards, that they belonged to variousgenera, and that the species of the different genera were often of the same size; so that the size alone, rather con fused, than assisted my arrangement. I was in the situation ofa man who had given to him pUe-mtte the mutilated and incomplete fragments of a hun dred skeletons, belonging to twenty sorts of animals, and it was required that each bone should be joined to that which it belonged to.

At the voice of comparative anatomy, each bone, each fragment regained its place. I have no expressions to de scribe the pleasure experienced, in perceiving that as I discovered one character, all the consequences more or less foreseen of this character, were suc cessively developed. The feet were conformable to what the teeth had announced, and the teeth to the feet ; the bones of the legs and the thighs, and every thing that ought to reunite these two extreme parts, were conformable to each other. In one word, each ofthe species sprung up from one of its ele ments. Those who will have the patience to follow me in these memoirs, may form some idea of the sensations which I experienced, in thus restoring by degrees, these ancient monuments of mighty re- * In the following passage Cuvier has more fully explained what he denominates \" the immutable laws prescribed to living beings.\" \" Every organized being forms a whole and entire system, of which all the parts mutually correspond and co-ope rate, to produce the same definite action, by a reciprocal reac tion ; none of these parts can change, without a change of the others also.

It is neces sary also that he should have seated in his brain, the instinct to hide himself and spread snares for his victim : such are the ge neral conditions of a carnivorous regimen ; every carnivorous animal must infallibly unite them, \u2014 without them the species could not subsist.

The loose blocks of stone, (called gray wethers,) scattered over some of the southern counties, are of this sandstone, as are also some ofthe large stones at Stonehenge*. * In all probability the ancient Britons took advantage of finding a groupe of large blocks of graywethers and other dilu vial stones, and arranged them near the places where they lay"], [361, "UPPER MARINE SANDSTONE. 319 At the forest of Fontainebleau in France, the thick ness of this sand and sandstone, exceeds one hun dred and seventy feet ; the sandstone occurs in loose blocks and irregular masses, and sometimes is distinctly stratified. It is this stone, which is used for paving the streets and roads in and round Paris; and the sand is so pure in many parts of this forest, that it is employed in making the finest glass. The marine sand on the top of Hampstead Heath, is now nearly cleared away to supply the metropolis : it is composed of minute particles of quartz, sometimes coloured with the oxide of iron ; the particles when examined with a microscope, appear to be partly rounded ; a few microscopic scales of brilliant mica are sometimes intermixed with it.

In no part of England does there occur any ex tensive bed of the upper marine sandstone with shells, (provincial]}- called crag); except in the coun ties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, it is of variable thickness, and is principally composed of sand and loose ferruginous sandstone, containing shells and bones, and mixed with gravel. In a valuable paper on the Geology of East Norfolk, by Mr. R. C. Taylor, published in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of Philosophy, April 1827, and the fol lowing Numbers, there is an interesting account of the geological position of the crag near the coast, with explanatory sections. \" The crag rests in part upon the London clay, and a laminated clay without fossils, and partly upon chalk, occupying the lowest sites; rarely rising to eighty feet above the present level of the sea ; and in general not more than half that elevation. The average level of its base may be considered to be about that of the present ocean. In certain cases, where the chalk hills attain a higher level than the crag, that deposit could only be expected to envelop or surround their sides, and not to penetrate into the chalk : such eminences would then present the appearance of tongues or promontories of chalk, protruding into the crag; and this circumstance accounts for the occasionally ap parent absence of that formation. But the crag has been subjected to abrasion by diluvial currents. Portions of its western edges have been swept away. Their fragments, mingled with those of chalk and preceding formations, piled in enormous heaps, form the cliffs of Cromer and Trimingham, 250 or 300 feet in thickness, upon the original crag, which rests in situ al their base.\" \u2014 No. 4, (New Series,) p. 288."], [363, "CRAG OF NORFOLK AND SUFFOLK. 321 The crag is in many parts covered by a thick mass of diluvium, which prevents its extension far inland from being observed; but the most remarkable cir cumstance noticed by Mr.Taylor, is the connection which seems to subsist between the upper surface ofthe crag, and an \"apparently continuous bed of vegetable substances, with which the crag is fre quently in contact, at an irregular elevation ; some times above, and sometimes below the low water mark. At some points this bed consists of forest peat, containing fir cones, and fragments of bones, and in others of woody clay ; and elsewhere of large stools of trees, standing thickly together, the stems appearing to have been broken off about 18 inches from their base. They are evidently rooted in the clay or sandy bed in which they originally grew, and their stems and branches lie around them, flattened by the pressure of from 30 to 300 feet of diluvial deposits. It is not possible to say how far inland this subterranean forest extends; but that it is not a mere external belt is obvious, from the con stant exposure and removal of new portions, at the base of the cliffs.\" This fact, mentioned by Mr. Taylor, is highly deserving notice ; as it is evident, that we have here one of those extensive lignite formations in or over tertiary sand and sandstone, to which continental geologists give the name of gres a lignites : it further appears to point out the geological relation of the crag with the upper beds of molasse in Switzerland; and what is still more important, it gives us the true geological po sition of the subterranean forest, that extends in the eastern side of England into Yorkshire, and to v"], [364, "322 UPPER FRESHWATER LIMESTONE. which I shall refer again in a subsequent chapter The fossils in the crag are not mineralized ; many of them appear to belong to species living in the present seas. The general characters of the crag are ably given by Mr. Taylor. \"A district, bordering a hundred miles upon our eastern coast, is occupied by an ancient marine deposit, continually changing its aspect, yet constant in its peculiar characters, and always to be understood by unerring data : now appearing as a ferruginous sandstone, then in com pact clay, and again considerably indurated ; some times blended in a mass of extinct zoophytes, sponges and alcyonites, forming a soft rock; oftener an irregularly accumulated mass of decomposed and broken littoral shells, loosely imbedded in sand like an ordinary sea beach, yet accompanied with the re mains of unknown animals. Sometimes forming the substratum of a considerable area; or, overwhelmed beneath the debris of older strata, only detected at intervals. At one point exhibiting groups of shell fish allied to those ofthe neighbouring sea; and at another, composed of numerous genera, which are neither to be recognised living in any part of our globe, nor assimilating to the fossil shells of other formations.\" \u2014 Phil. Mag. page 350. A small portion of the upper marine formation occurs in the Isle of Wight and the opposite coast of Hampshire. Upper Freshwater Limestone. \u2014 This formation, though extensively spread over many parts of the continent, is scarcely known in England : it occurs in the Isle of Wight. In the Paris basin it covers all the other tertiary strata, and is itself covered"], [365, "UPPER FRESHWATER LIMESTONE. 323 with vegetable soil. Below the freshwater lime stone there is sometimes a bed of sand, intermixed with greenish or reddish earth, and millstone : the upper part of the freshwater limestone also becomes intermixed with siliceous earth, and passes into mill stone. This millstone has generally a reddish or yellow ish colour, but that of the best quality is white ; it is penetrated by a multitude of irregular cavities, in which there are numerous siliceous filaments : these cavities are lined with an ochreous coat, but are sometimes filled with argillaceous earth or sand; they do not communicate with each other: the sub stance ofthe millstone, when unmixed, is pure silex. All the best millstones in England are brought from France, and are known by the name of Burrh stones. Freshwater limestone in the vicinity of Paris, has generally a grayish white, or a yellowish colour; it is sometimes as tender as chalk, and sometimes hard and compact, with a fine grain and conchoidal fracture : in the latter state it is brittle, and breaks into sharp-edged fragments like flint. Some of this limestone, particularly that of Chateau Landon, presents the character of a transition marble, and will receive a fine polish. Several of the basins with jets d'eau in the gardens of the Thuilleries are made of this marble. Many of the harder fresh water limestones, however, rapidly disintegrate on exposure to air and moisture, and fall to the state of marie, and are used as manure. This formation is characterized by containing exclusively fresh- Y 2"], [366, "324 STRATA IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. water and land shells, similar to what are found in the neighbouring marshes ; they belong to a small number of genera or species, being chiefly lym nites, planorbes, turbinated shells, (allied to ceri thia,) cyclostoma, and helices. Freshwater limestone occurs in many parts of the South of France ; in Auvergne it is covered by a vast mass of volcanic tufa and basalt : it con tains bones of mammiferous quadrupeds, together with lymnites and freshwater shells. The fresh water limestone under Gergovia, near Clermont, is distinctly stratified, and presents the characters of a soft grayish chalk. The upper freshwater lime stone, may be regarded as the most recent rock for mation ofthe ancient world. For the first accurate account of the tertiary strata, and of the alternation of marine and fresh water strata in England, we are indebted to Mr. Web ster, who published, in the 2nd volume of the Trans. of the Geolog. Society of London, a very interesting description of these strata in the Isle of Wight, and their connection with the subjacent chalk. The chalk covered by the London clay, passes under the channel, called the Solent, and rises in the middle ofthe island, forming a range of hills which extends from Culver Cliffs on the east, to the Needles on the west. Here we meet with the only remarkable de rangement of the beds of chalk, and the superior strata, which has been noticed in England. The strata of this range of hills are thrown into a posi tion absolutely vertical, evincing the action of some mighty disturbing force, which can be so often ob-"], [367, "325 STRATA IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. served to have acted on the lower strata in various parts of the world, and also on the upper strata in the vicinity of the Alps. The whole thickness of the beds in the Isle of Wight, which are nearly vertical, according to Mr. Webster's measurement is not less than three thousand feet, including fourteen hundred and eighty-one feet of strata above the chalk, about nine hundred and eighty-seven feet of chalk, and five or six hundred feet of lower strata. Further south, the strata under chalk are seen again in their ori ginal horizontal position ; and on the northern side, there are hills composed of horizontal strata, evi dently of a formation posterior to the time when the chalk strata were overturned. That the latter were once nearly horizontal, may be inferred from their always occurring in that position in the south ern counties, and is rendered certain from the fol lowing circumstance described by Mr. Webster. In one of the vertical beds consisting of loose sand, are several layers of flints, extending from the bot tom to the top of the cliff. \"These flints have been rounded by attrition, are from an inch to eight inches in diameter, and appear to have be longed to the chalk. Now it is inconceivable that these flints could have been originally deposited in their present position : they distinctly point out the former horizontal direction of this series. There are no signs of partial disturbance in these beds ; the whole appears therefore to have been moved together.\" The enormous force required to occa sion a displacement of the strata, not only through the whole island but into Dorsetshire, where it can"], [368, "326 STRATA IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. be traced beyond Lulworth, must have been suffi cient to form or destroy extensive lakes, and per haps to separate England from the Continent. Close adjoining the vertical strata on the northern side ofthe island, occur a series of horizontal strata, which are distinctly visible in a hill called Headon : \u2014 these strata consist of an alternating series of freshwater and marine deposits, bearing a striking similarity in their fossil contents, to the strata in the vicinity of Paris. According to Mr. Webster, they consist of 1. A calcareous stratum, containing only fresh- water shells. \u2014 Upper freshwater. 2. Greenish marie with marine shells. \u2014 Upper marine. 3. Marie with freshwater shells. \u2014 Lower fresh- water. 4. Dark blue clay without shells. \u2014 Lower ma- rine. Thus we have over chalk four distinct forma tions. No. 4. A lower marine formation, which includes the London clay. A lower freshwater for mation, No. 3. The strata of this formation con sist of sandy, calcareous, and argillaceous marie ; some of them appear to be formed almost wholly of the fragments of freshwater shells, without any mixture whatever of marine shells. \" From the quantity of these shells, and the regularity and extent of the strata, we are compelled (says Mr. Webster) to admit, that the spot where they now are, was once occupied by fresh water, in which these animals existed in a living state. Over this fresh water occurs an upper stratum, No. 2, which"], [369, "327 STRATA IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. contains a vast number of fossil shells wholly ma rine. Again, over this marine formation, in the same hill, is a calcareous stratum fifty-five feet in thickness, No. 1, every part of which contains freshwater shells in great abundance, without any admixture of marine exuvi\u00e6. Many of the shells are in high preservation ; and the animals must formerly have lived in the very spots where they now are, the shells being so fragile, that they could not have been removed from their original situation without breaking. Part of the stone of this for mation is very hard and compact, and has long been extensively used for building-stone. This stratum appears to have extended over the whole of the northern part of the Isle of Wight ; but it has not yet been discovered in any other situation on this side of the water : it may be considered as the latest formation of rock we are acquainted with in England, and agrees in many of its mineralo gical characters, and the fossils it contains, with the freshwater limestone, calcaire d'eaa douce, in the vicinity of Paris; they are different from any other known rock.\" But no where has there been disco vered in the series of freshwater strata in England, any trace of the remarkable beds of gypsum con taining bones of unknown genera, and species of quadrupeds, similar to the gypsum of Montmartre. Observations. Though the tertiary strata are the most recent of all the re gular rock formations, and contain the remains of animals, similar in the essential parts of their organization to the present races"], [370, "328 observations on the alternations of living animals, yet at the period of their deposition, the con dition of our planet must have been very different from the pre sent one. Many of the tertiary strata are original siliceous depositions \u2014 the mill-stones for instance, with the thick beds of pure siliceous sandstone passing into chalcedonic flint or chert, (silex come) are as evidently original formations as any of the lower rocks. In the present seas or lakes there are no siliceous formations taking place, nor have we any instances of siliceous depositions, except from boiling springs. These considerations will alone be sufficient to convince us, that the tertiary strata were deposited under different circumstances, from any that we have a knowledge of, either from experience or historic records. The alternation of marine and freshwater formations have been differently accounted for. According to one hypothesis, the sea, which at present contains a variable portion of salt in different latitudes, may formerly have deposited all its salt, and become fresh at one period, and have subsequently received another saline impregnation ; there is nothing absurd or highly improbable in this hypothesis, but it is entirely gratuitous. Some geologists deny that freshwater shells are a sufficient proof that the strata in which they are found were not deposited in salt water. In the salt lakes iu Westphalia, lymnites, which may be regarded as the most characteristic of all freshwater molusc\u00e6, are observed to flourish together with freshwater plants ; and many testaceous animals, it has recently been discovered, will live equally well in fresh or salt water. The number of terres trial quadrupeds that have left their bones in the freshwater limestone and gypsum, afford, however, a strong presumption, that the water was fresh that filled the lakes, on the banks of which they lived ; and the extensive lakes of fresh-water in America render the existence of such lakes in a former state of our planet, highly probable. Nor will the change from salt to freshwater require any forced hypothesis to explain it, if we se parate from the investigation, the difficulties which it has in common with other geological problems. It is granted by all geologists, that the calcareous beds on the summits of the Jura range, or the Pyrenees, have once been covered by the sea. We may therefore grant that the chalk strata were also once under its surface. Now if we admit, that the water in which the strata around Paris were deposited,"], [371, "OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER STRATA. 329 was surrounded by mountains and dry land, so as to form au inland sea or lake, communicating by a narrow opening with the ocean, and that large rivers flowed into this inland lake ; the water would at first be salt: but if by any cause the opening was closed, the water would gradually become fresh again. If at a subsequent period the passage was re-opened by an earthquake or inundation, the sea would once more flow into the lake, and the water would again become salt. Such alterna tions might take place repeatedly, without any change in the relative level of the ocean. The difficulty of conceiving these alternations, has arisen from supposing that it was necessary for the sea to sink to its present level, and rise again repeatedly; but this is by no means required, to explain the alternate suc cession of freshwater, and marine formations. The causes which have depressed the sea to its present level, or have elevated our present continents above its surface, took place after the deposition of the tertiary strata, as might be proved by numerous incontrovertible facts. Whether in a still more remote epoch, all the present continents may not have been repeatedly submerged in tbe ocean, and again elevated above its surface, is an inquiry not necessarily connected with the deposi tion of the tertiary strata, as these changes were anterior to their formation ."], [372, "330 CHAPTER XV. ON EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANIC PHENOME- NA ON RECENT AND ANCIENT VOLCA- NOES. \u2014SUBMARINE VOLCANOES. \u2014 AND ON VOLCANIC ROCKS AND PRODUCTS. ACCUSTOMED to view the hills in our own country in a state of profound repose, presenting the same unvaried outline in each succeeding year, we can scarcely conceive the possibility ofa whole district being covered with new mountains and another soil, in the space of a single night; yet such changes have been produced, by the united agency of earthquakes and volcanoes, within the limits of authentic history. For a particular description of recent volcanic eruptions, and the changes they have produced on the surrounding countries, I must refer the reader to the works of Spallanzani, Dolomieu, Sir William Hamilton, and M. Hum boldt, and to the recent account of the Island of Java, by Lieutenant-governor Raffles. In the present chapter, I propose, lst, to describe those phenomena that indicate the connection be tween earthquakes and volcanoes, and between the volcanoes in distant countries; 2ndly, to take a view ofthe remains of ancient volcanoes, that prove the extensive action of internal heat on the crust of the globe ; and, 3rdly, to give a concise account of vol canic rocks and products."], [373, "331 EARTHQUAKES. Earthquakes and volcanoes may be considered as different effects produced by the agency of sub terranean fire. They frequently accompany each other; and in all instances that have been observed, the first eruption of a volcano, is preceded by an earthquake of greater or less extent. Volcanoes do not make their appearance in every country where the shock of an earthquake is felt : but earthquakes are more frequent in volcanic districts than in any other. Earthquakes are almost always preceded by an uncommon agitation of the waters of the ocean, and of lakes. Springs send forth tor rents of mud, accompanied with a disagreeable stench. The air is generally calm, but the cattle discover much alarm, and seem to be instinctively aware of approaching calamity. A deep rumbling noise, like that of carriages over a rough pavement, \u2014 a rushing sound like wind, \u2014 or a tremendous explosion like the discharge of artillery, imme diately precede the shock, which suddenly heaves the ground upwards, or tosses it from side to side, with violent and successive vibrations. The shock seldom lasts longer than a minute ; but it is fre quently succeeded by others of greater or less vio lence, which continue to agitate the surface of the earth for a considerable time. During these shocks, large chasms and openings are made in the ground, through which smoke and flames are seen to issue: these sometimes break out where no chasms can be perceived. More frequently stones, or torrents of water, are ejected from these openings. In vio lent earthquakes, the chasms are so extensive, that"], [374, "332 EARTHQUAKES. large cities have in a moment sunk down and for ever disappeared, leaving a lake of water in the place. Such was the fate of Euphemia in Calabria, in 1638, as described by Kircher, who was ap proaching the place, when the agitation ofthe ocean obliged him to land at Lopizicum : \" Here (says he) scenes of ruin every where appeared around me ; but my attention was quickly turned from more remote to contiguous danger, by a deep rumbling sound, which every moment grew louder. The place where we stood shook most dreadfully : after some time, the violent paroxysm ceasing, I stood up, and turning my eyes to look for Euphe mia, saw only a frightful black cloud. We waited till it had passed away, when nothing but a dismal and putrid lake was to be seen where the city once stood.\" The extent to which earthquakes produce sensi ble effects on the waters of springs and lakes in di stant parts of the world, is truly remarkable. During the earthquake of Lisbon in 1755, almost all the springs and lakes in Britain and every part of Eu rope were violently agitated, many of them throw ing up mud and sand, and emitting a f\u0153tid odour. On the morning of the earthquake, the hot springs at Toplitz in Bohemia suddenly ceased to flow for a minute, and then burst forth with prodigious vio lence, throwing up turbid water, the temperature of which was higher than before : it is said to have continued so ever since. The hot wells at Bristol were coloured red, and rendered unfit for use, for some months afterwards. Even the distant waters"], [375, "333 EARTHQUAKES. of Lake Ontario*, in North America, were vio lently agitated at the time. These phenomena offer proofs of subterranean communications under a large portion of the globe ; they also indicate, that a great quantity of gas or elastic vapour was suddenly generated and endeavouring to escape. From the f\u0153tid odour perceived in some situations, it may be inferred that this gas is hydrogen or sul phuretted hydrogen. In other instances it may be steam, which condensing again would produce a vacuum, and occasion the external air to press downwards ; which has been observed in mines, immediately after the shock of an earthquake. The space over which the vibration of the dry ground is felt is very great, but generally wider in one direction than another ; and where a succession of earthquakes has taken place in the same district, it is observed that the noise and shock approach from the same quarter. It has been before men tioned, that earthquakes are most frequent in vol canic districts; but the shocks are not the most violent, in the immediate vicinity of volcanoes. On the contrary, they are stronger in the more distant part of a volcanic country. The ground is agitated with greater force, as the surface has a smaller number of apertures communicating with the in terior. \" At Naples and Messina, and at the foot of Cotopaxi and Tungurahua, earthquakes are only * It Jias been observed during many earthquakes in the East ern States, that the subterranean noise arid motion appeared to commence from the Lakes, and proceed towards the Atlantic Ocean, in a direction from the north-west."], [376, "334 EARTHQUAKES. dreaded when vapours and flames do not issue from the craters.\" \u2014 (Humboldt.) The connection of earthquakes with volcanoes was noticed by ancient writers, and the latter were properlv regarded as the openings, through which the inclosed vapour and ignited matter that occasion earthquakes, found a passage. Strabo in his Geo graphy states, that \" the town of Regium, situated on the Italian side of the Straits of Messina, was so called, according to \u00c6schylus, from the circumstance that the island of Sicily was rent off from the con tinent by earthquakes. Proofs of this arise out of the phenomena attending \u00c6tna and other parts of Sicily and of the Lipari Islands, and even the op posite continent, Now, indeed, when craters are opened, through which fire and ignited matter and water are poured out, it is said that the land near the Straits is seldom shaken by earthquakes : but formerly, when all the passages to the surface were obstructed, the fire and vapour confined in the earth, occasioned frequent earthquakes, and the land being rent, admitted the ocean. At the same time, Prochyta and an adjacent island were also torn off from the continent, while other islands rose from the ocean, as frequently happens at this day.\" Vol. i. page 396. It is highly probable that every extensive earth quake is followed by a volcanic eruption more or less remote, unless (as not unfrequently happens) the elastic vapour immediately escapes from fissures made at the time, in the countries that are the most violently convulsed. An earthquake was strongly felt in Geneva when I was there, February 19, 1822,"], [377, "335 EARTHQUAKES. and did considerable damage in several towns and villages in Savoy and France. A few weeks afterwards, I travelled from Geneva to Lyons, and from thence to the ancient volcanoes near Cler mont. In the course of my route, I made fre quent inquiries respecting the effects ofthe earth quake : it appeared to have been most strongly felt along the valley of the Rhone, and the shock was not less severe in the volcanic district of Auvergne; its direction was from the south-east: and on that and the following days, there were several eruptions from Vesuvius. The frequency of earthquakes at particular periods is well deserving notice. In the fourth and fifth centuries some ofthe most civilized parts of the world were almost desolated by these awful visitations. Thrace, Asia Minor, and Syria, according to cotemporary historians, suffered most severely : the earth was agitated continually for long periods, and flames were seen to burst from the earth, over a vast extent of surface. On the 26th of January, A.D. 447, subterranean thunders were heard from the Black to the Red Sea, and the earth was convulsed without intermission for the space of six months ; in many places the air seemed to be on fire, towns and large tracts of ground were swal lowed up in Phrygia. On the 20th of May, A.D. 520, the city of Antioch was overturned by a dreadful earthquake, and two hundred and fifty thousand of its inhabitants are said to have been crushed in the ruins. A raging fire covered the ground on which the city was built, and the district around; spreading over an extent of forty-two"], [378, "336 EARTHQUAKES. miles in diameter, and a surface of fourteen hun dred square miles. About the middle of the last century, after the earthquake at Lisbon, \u2014 Europe, Africa, and Ame rica, were for some time repeatedly agitated by sub terranean explosions ; as may be seen, by referring to the journals of that time. \u00c6tna, which had been in a state of profound repose for eighty years, broke out with great activity ; and according to Humboldt, some of the most tremendous earth quakes and volcanic eruptions ever recorded in hi story were witnessed in Mexico. In the night of the 19th of September 1759, a vast volcano broke out in a lofty cultivated plain, a tract of ground more than twelve miles in extent rose up like a bladder to the height of five hundred and twenty four feet, and six new mountains were formed, higher than the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire. More recently (in 1812) the tremendous earth quakes in the Caraccas were followed by an erup tion in the Island of St. Vincent's, from a volcano that had not been burning since the year 1718, and violent oscillations of the ground were felt both in the islands and on the coasts of America. It may be inferred from these circumstances, that the cause of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions is seated deep below the surface of the earth; in confirma tion of which, it will only be necessary to state, that on the same day on which Lisbon was nearly de stroyed, all Europe, and a great part of northern Africa, felt the shock more or less severely : its ef fects were also sensible across the Atlantic both in"], [379, "EARTHQUAKES. 337 the United States, and the West Indies. Incredible as it may seem, one-fourth of the Northern hemi sphere was agitated by the same earthquake. The bed of the Atlantic was raised above the surface of the ocean, and flame and vapour were discharged : this was observed by vessels at sea. If we take a terrestrial globe, and cover those parts of it that were thus affected by the earthquake, with black crape, we shall obtain a more distinct idea of the extent of surface shaken, than a mere verbal de scription can convey. This appears to have been one of the most severe shocks that the old continent had experienced for several centuries. The cause which could effect a simultaneous concussion over such a vast extent, must probably have been seated nearly midway, between the centre of the globe and its surface. It has been remarked that in general, earthquakes are more severely felt in mountainous than in low countries: this might be expected from the structure of the earth*. In alpine districts, the primary mountains are not pressed with the incumbent mass of secondary rocks, and in such situations the resistance to a force acting from beneath will be much less, as all the weight of secondary rocks is removed. In very violent earthquakes, the secon dary strata are broken or agitated ; but proofs are not wanting, of lesser vibrations being stopped by their pressure. Humboldt says, he has seen work men hasten from the mines of Marienburgh in * See a paper on Earthquakes by the Rev. Mr. Mitchell, Philosophical Transactions, 1759. Z"], [380, "338 EARTHQUAKES. Saxony, alarmed by agitations of the earth that were not felt at the surface. During the earthquake at Lisbon, the miners in Derbyshire felt the rocks move, and heard noises which were scarcely per ceived by those above. That an expansive force acting from beneath is the proximate cause of earthquakes, can scarcely be denied ; and the pro digious power of steam, when suddenly generated, seems equal to their production, if the quantity be sufficiently great. It is said that a single drop of water falling into a furnace of melted copper, will blow up the whole building. This may be an ex aggerated statement ; but the prodigious force of steam at high temperatures is well known, and there can be no difficulty in admitting, that if a cur rent of subterranean water were to find access to a mass of lava many miles in extent, and most in tensely heated, it would produce an earthquake more or less violent, in proportion to the quantity of steam generated, and its distance from the sur face. When the hydrogen gas exploded in a mine near Workington in Cumberland, a shock like that of an earthquake was felt by ships in the river, at two miles distance. The horrid crash like the rattling of carriages, which precedes earthquakes, may be occasioned by the rending of the rocks, or parting of the strata through which the confined vapour is forcing a passage. In volcanic phenomena, we observe a cause in present activity, that can overthrow mountains, form new islands, and raise up the bed of the ocean : hence the geologist may infer, that the same cause,"], [381, "VOLCANOES. 339 acting with greater intensity and more extensively, has been the agent employed by the Author of Na ture, to elevate new and submerge ancient conti nents, and to change and renovate the surface of the globe. We are indeed acquainted with no other natural agent, that can have effected the mighty changes which the crust of our planet has undergone. The products of volcanoes, particu larly of ancient ones, are analogous in their com position and internal structure to the oldest rocks of granite, sienite, and porphyry, and indicate not obscurely, the mode in which these rocks were formed : hence the study of volcanoes and volcanic rocks is an important branch of the science of geo logy. Werner and his disciples, however, held that volcanoes were merely produced by the ignition of beds of coal, in the secondary strata. Volcanoes are openings made in the earth's surface by internal fires ; they regularly, or at in tervals, throw out smoke, vapour, flame, large stones, sand, and melted stone called lava. Some volcanoes throw out torrents of mud and boiling water. Volcanoes most frequently exist in the vi cinity of the sea or large lakes, and also break out from unfathomable depths below the surface, and form new islands and reefs of rock. When a vol cano breaks out in a new situation, it is preceded by violent earthquakes, the heated surface of the ground frequently swells and heaves up, until a fissure or rent is formed, sometimes of vast extent. Through this opening, masses of rock with flame, smoke and lava, are thrown out, and choke up part of the passage, and confine the eruption to one or z2"], [382, "340 VOLCANOES. more apertures, round which conical hills or moun tains are formed. The concavity in the centre is called the crater. The indications of an approach ing eruption from a dormant volcano are an in crease of smoke from the summit, which sometimes rises to a vast height, branching in the form of a pine-tree. Tremendous explosions, like the firing of artillery, commence aster the increase of smoke, and are succeeded by red-coloured flames, and showers of stones. At length the lava flows out from the top of the crater, or breaks through the sides ofthe mountain, and covers the neighbouring plains with melted matter, which becoming conso lidated, forms a stony mass, often not less than some hundred square miles in extent, and several yards in thickness. The eruption of lava has been known to continue several months. Intensely black clouds composed ofa kind of dark-coloured sand or pow der, improperly called ashes, are thrown out of the crater after the lava ceases to flow, and sometimes involve the surrounding country in total darkness at noon-day. Towards the conclusion, the colour ofthe volcanic sand changes to white : it consists of pumice in a finely comminuted state. During an eruption of \u00c6tna, a space of one hundred and fifty miles in circuit was covered with a stratum of volcanic sand or ashes twelve feet thick. When the lava flows freely, the earthquakes and explo sions become less violent ; which proves that they were occasioned by the confinement of the erupted matter both gaseous and solid. The smoke and vapour of volcanoes are highly electrical. The quantity of lava thrown out during a single"], [383, "341 VOLCANOES. eruption of a volcano, seems almost incredible to those who have not observed volcanic countries. Kercher in his Mundus Subterraneus, lib. 4, cap. 8, published in 1660, says, that the ejections of Mount \u00c6tna would, if collected, form a mass twenty times as large as the mountain itself; and a few years afterwards, viz. in 1669, the same mountain covered with a fresh current of lava eighty-four square miles; and again in 1775, according to Dolomieu, the same volcano poured out another stream of lava, twelve miles in length, one mile and a half in breadth, and two hundred feet in height. Hence it is evident, that the seat of the fire is not in the mountain itself, but deep in the earth : the volcano is not the furnace, but the chimney ; and it will be necessary to bear this in mind, if we would form an adequate idea ofthe extensive effects of volcanic action. Seneca appears to have formed a distinct notion of the seat of volcanic fire, when he remarks, that the volcano does not supply the fire, it only affords it a passage \" in ipso monte non alimentum habet, sed viam.\" The largest known current of modern lava was formed by a volcano in Iceland in 1783; it is sixty miles in length, and twelve broad, equalling in extent any continuous rock formation in England. The most extraordinary volcanic eruption recorded in history, for the extent of its effects, took place in Sumbawa, one of the Molucca Islands, in April 1815. It is described in the History of Java by Lieut.-governor Raffles. \"This eruption extended perceptible evidences of its existence over the whole of the Molucca Islands, over Java, a considerable portion of Celebes, Su-"], [384, "342 VOLCANOES. matra, and Borneo, to a circumference of a thou sand statute miles from its centre, by tremulous motions and the report of explosions ; while within the rang-e of its more immediate activity, em- _ bracing a space of three hundred miles around, it produced the most astonishing effects, and excited the most alarming apprehensions. In Java, at the distance of three hundred miles, it seemed to be awfully present. The sky was overcast at noon day with clouds of ashes ; the sun was enveloped in an atmosphere, whose ' palpable' density he was unable to penetrate ; showers of ashes covered the houses, the streets, and the fields, to the depth of several inches ; and amid this darkness, explosions were heard at intervals like the report of artillery or the noise of distant thunder. So fully did the resemblance of the noises to the report of cannon impress the minds of some officers, that from an apprehension of pirates on the coast, vessels were dispatched to afford relief. Superstition on the other hand was busily at work on the minds of the natives, and attributed the reports, to an artillery of a different description, to that of pirates. All conceived that the effects experienced might be caused by eruptions of some of the numerous vol canoes on the island ; but no one could have con jectured that the showers of ashes which darkened the air and covered the ground of the eastern dis tricts of Java, could have proceeded from a moun tain in Sumbawa, at the distance of several hun dred miles.\" The lieutenant-governor of Java directed a cir cular to the different residents, requiring them to"], [385, "343 VOLCANOES. transmit to the governor a statement of the facts and circumstances connected with this eruption. The most remarkable circumstance attending this erup tion, is the distance at which the explosions were heard in the islands of the Indian Sea. \" From Sumbawa, to the part of Sumatra where the sound was noticed, is about nine hundred and seventy geographical miles. From Sumbawa to Ternate is a distance of about seven hundred and twenty miles. The distance to which the cloud of ashes was carried so thickly as to produce utter darkness, was clearly pointed out to be the Island of Celebes, and the district of Grisik in Java; the former two hundred and seventeen nautical miles in a direct line, the latter more than three hundred geogra phical miles.\" The greatest distance at which the eruption of any volcano had been previously heard, is six hundred miles : according to M. Humboldt, the explosions from Cotopaxi are sometimes sen sibly heard at that distance from the volcano, which is one of the largest and highest in the American continent. The long period of repose which sometimes takes place between two eruptions of the same volcano, is particularly remarkable. From the building of Rome to the 79th year of the Christian \u00e6ra, no mention is made of Vesuvius, though it had evi dently been in a prior state of activity, as Hercula neum and Pompeii, which were destroyed by the eruption of that year, are paved with lava. From the 12th to the 16th century it remained quiet for nearly four hundred years, and the crater was overgrown with lofty trees. The crater was de-"], [386, "344 VOLCANOES. scended by Bracchini, an Italian writer, prior to the great eruption of 1631 : the bottom was at that time a vast plain, surrounded by caverns and grot toes. \u00c6tna has continued burning since the time of the poet Pindar, with occasional intervals of re pose, seldom exceeding thirty or forty years. The eruptions of the Peak of Teneriffe have been very rare during the last two centuries. Ac cording to Humboldt, \" the long intervals of repose appear to characterize volcanoes highly elevated*. Stromboli, which is one of the lowest, is always burning; the eruptions of Vesuvius are rarer, but still more frequent than those of \u00c6tna. The co lossal summits of the Andes, Cotopaxi and Tungu rahua, scarcely have an eruption once in a century. The Peak of Teneriffe seemed to be extinguished for ninety-two years, when it made its last eruption by a lateral opening in 1798. In this interval Ve suvius had sixteen eruptions.\" The greatest erup tions of lava from \u00c6tna and Vesuvius are always from the sides of these mountains ; but these lateral eruptions, finish by an ejection of ashes and flames from the crater at the summit of the mountain. In the Peak of Teneriffe, an eruption of lava from the summit has not taken place for ages ; and in the recent great eruption of 1798, the crater re mained inactive, nor did its bottom fall in. Those who are acquainted with the laws of hy drostatics, and know the immense power that would * This observation of M. Humboldt will not be found univer sally correct ; for the small volcano of Vulcano, one of the Li pari islands, was in a dormant state thirteen hundred years."], [387, "VOLCANOES. 345 be required to raise even a column of water from the level of the sea, to the top of \u00c6tna or Tene riffe, will not be surprised that the lava forces itself out of the sides, and rarely rises to the top of the crater, in lofty volcanic mountains. It has been calculated, that the force required to raise a column of lava to the height of the summit of Teneriffe, (twelve thousand five hundred feet,) would be equal to that of one thousand atmospheres ; andM. Dau buisson, who has made the calculation, states, that if an opening were effected in the volcano at the level ofthe sea, under the above pressure, the lava and stones would be forced out with a velocity equal to two hundred and seventy metres, or eight hun dred feet per second. \u2014 Tom. i. p. 173. The elevation of volcanic craters varying, as Humboldt observes, from six hundred to eighteen thousand feet, must not only influence the fre quency of their eruptions, but must modify also the quality of the substances ejected. \u2014 \"Some volcanoes only eject lava from their sides, like Teneriffe, although it has a crater on its summit ; others have lateral eruptions as I observed at An tisana in Quito, at the height of thirteen thousand feet, and their summit has never been pierced. Others equally hollow in their interior, as many phenomena indicate, act only mechanically on the surrounding country, breaking the strata and chang ing the surface of the soil : thus the volcanic moun tain of Chimborazo, with its dome of volcanic por phyry, (trachyte,) at the height of twenty-two thou sand two hundred feet, has no permanent aperture on its summit or its sides ; the small crater by which"], [388, "346 SUBMARINE VOLCANOES. its eruptions are effected, is placed on the Plain of Calpi. The volcano of Pichinca, fifteen thousand feet high, and which I have particularly studied, has never ejected a current of lava since the exca vation of the present valleys. On the contrary, the volcano of Popocateptl in Mexico, sixteen hundred feet in height, pours out narrow currents of lava, like those from the smaller volcanoes of Auvergne or Italy.\" Submarine volcanoes are preceded by a violent boiling and agitation of the water, and by the dis charge of volumes of gas and vapour, which take fire and roll in sheets of flame over the surface of the waves. Masses of rock are darted through the water with great violence, and accumulate till they form new islands. Sometimes the crater of the volcano rises out of the sea during an eruption. In 1783, a submarine volcano broke out near Ice land, which formed a new island; it raged with great fury for several months. The island after wards sunk, leaving only a reef of rocks. In Decem ber 1720, a violent earthquake was felt at Tercera, one ofthe Azores ; the next morning a new island nine miles in circumference was seen, from the centre of which rose a column of smoke : it after wards sunk to a level with the sea. A small island was formed in 1811 by a submarine volcano at a little distance from St. Michael's, one ofthe Azores: it was a mass of black rock, described by the cap tain of the Sabrina frigate, who witnessed its for mation, to be equal in height to the high Tor at Matlock. A gentleman who visited the Azores in 1813, informs me that it has sunk down and dis-"], [389, "347 SUBMARINE VOLCANOES. appeared : there is now eighty fathom water in the place. Near Santorini, in the Grecian archipelago, sub marine volcanoes have repeatedly burst forth during the last two thousand years, and formed several new islands : three ofthe ancient eruptions are recorded by Pliny, Strabo, and Seneca. The last eruption was in the year 1767. If the sea or large lakes, have once covered our continents, it follows that the greater part of the present and ancient volcanoes were once subma rine. I am informed by Mr. Leckie, that calca reous strata with organic remains rest on beds of volcanic tufa on the eastern side of Sicily, and de cline towards the sea. The alternations of strata of tertiary limestone with beds of lava on the side of \u00c6tna near Lentini, are described by Dr. Dau benny. (See p. 210.) These facts indicate that the volcanic fires in the vicinity of \u00c6tna once raged under the ocean. Almost all the new volcanoes on record, have broken out from under the sea. Some volcanoes in Europe, and many in the Andes, throw out aqueous torrents intermixed with mud and stones ; indeed, the American volcanoes more frequently eject mud than lava. Eruptions of water from \u00c6tna and Vesuvius are rare, and some which have been described as flowing from the crater of the former, liave been merely the tor rents of melted water from snow on its summit. The volcano of Macaluba in Sicily presents the phenomena of mud, water, and stones thrown out of the crater. Ferrara describes an alarming erup tion which took place on the 29th of September"], [390, "348 MUD-VOLCANOES. 1777 : \" Dreadful noises were heard all round ; and from the midst of the plain, in which was formed a vast gulf, an immense column of mud arose to the height of about one hundred feet, which abandoned by the impulsive force, assumed the appearance of a large tree at the top. In the middle, stones of all kinds and sizes were darted violently and vertically, within the body of the co- lumn. This terrible explosion lasted half an hour, Avhen it became quiet; but after a few minutes re- sumed its course, and with these intermissions con- tinued all the day. During the time of this ph\u00e6- nomenon, a pungent odour of sulphuretted hydro- gen gas was perceived at a great distance, to the surprise ofthe inhabitants, who did not dare to ap- proach this spot on account of the horrible noises. But many came the following day, and found that the new great orifice had ejected several streams of liquid chalk (creta) ; which had covered, with an ashy crust of many feet, all the surrounding space, filling the cavities and chinks. The hard substances ejected were fragments of calcareous tufa, of crystallized gypsum, pebbles of quartz, and iron pyrites, which had lost their lustre, and were broken in pieces. All these substances form the outward circuit at this day. The unpleasant smell of sulphur still continued, and the water which re- mained in the holes was hot for many months, while a keen smell of burning, issued from the nu merous orifices around the great gulf, which is now completely filled.\" Volcanoes frequently occur in groups, some times arranged along a line as if they had originally"], [391, "VOLCANOES. 349 been formed over one vast chasm, like the minor volcanoes on the sides of \u00c6tna ; sometimes they are dispersed irregularly over the surface, and sometimes they are isolated like \u00c6tna, and the Peak of Teneriffe. The volcanoes in South America, Humboldt ob serves, instead of being isolated or dispersed in irregular groups as in Europe, are arranged in rows, like the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, or the volcanoes of Java ; sometimes in one line, and sometimes in two parallel lines. These lines are generally in the same direction, as the chain of the Cordilleras, but sometimes (as in Mexico) they form an angle with it of 70\u00b0. The volcanoes of Mexico, he further observes, are placed in a nar row zone between latitude 18\u00b0 59' and 19\u00b0 12'. This he regards as a vast chasm, seven hundred and fifty miles in length, extending from the coast of the Atlantic, to that of the Pacific, and to the islands of Revillagiedo in the same direction. Our knowledge of volcanic geography is at pre sent imperfect, but among the principal volcanic groups and ranges, the following may be briefly enumerated. In the Azores, there are no less than forty-two active or dormant volcanoes, and submarine volca noes not unfrequently break forth in their vicinity. Almost all the other Islands in the Atlantic, and many of the West Indian Islands, are volcanic. Numerous Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Seas, have large volcanoes : in the Island of Java alone, there is a range consisting of thirty eight large volcanic mountains, some of which are"], [392, "350 VOLCANOES. at present in an active state; they are detached from each other, and though some of them are covered by the vegetation of many ages, the indi cations of their former eruptions, are numerous and unequivocal. Numerous volcanoes exist, near or within the Arctic circle, in Kamschatka, in Greenland, and in Iceland. A range of active or dormant volca noes extends from the southern extremity of Ame rica, to the northern, along a line of six thousand miles in length. Of the volcanoes in Northern Asia, or the interior of Africa, we have little in formation, and the volcanoes covered by the sea, cannot be estimated ; but from the above statement, we are authorized in believing, that volcanic fires are more extensively operative, than many geo logists are disposed to admit. Numerous facts might be cited, to prove the connection which exists, between volcanoes at a vast distance from each other. In 1783, when a submarine volcano near Iceland, suddenly ceased its eruptions, a volcano broke out two hundred miles distant in the interior of the Island. On the night in which Lima and Callao were destroyed by an earthquake, four new volcanoes broke out in the Andes. The source of volcanic fire is seated deep under the surface of the earth ; were it not so, the ground in their vicinity would sink down. Yet \u00c6tna has continued to pour out streams of lava for three thousand years, and Stromboli has had daily eruptions, for nearly as long a period *. * Since the period of authentic history, no great changes have taken place in the country round \u00c6tna ; but it appears from"], [393, "DESTRUCTION OF VOLCANOES. 351 There are some instances, of volcanoes having been entirely engulphed in the chasms beneath them. The volcano ofthe Pic in the Island of Timor, one of the Moluccas, is known to have served as a prodigious watch-light, which was seen at sea at the distance of three hundred miles. In the year 1638, the mountain during a violent eruption en tirely disappeared, and in its place, there is now a lake. Many of the circular lakes in the South of Italy are supposed to have been formed by the sinking down of volcanoes ; but the best authenti cated account we have of the destruction of a vol canic mountain, is given by Governor Raffles in his History of Java. \" The Papandayang, situated at the western part of the district of Cheribor, in the province of Suka pura, was formerly one of the largest volcanoes in the Island of Java ; but the greatest part of it was swallowed up in the earth, after a short but very severe combustion in the year 1772. The account which has remained of this event asserts, that near midnight, between the llth and 12th of August, there was observed about the mountain an uncom- Virgil, as well as from a passage in Strabo before quoted, that an ancient tradition existed of the sudden separation of Sicily from Italy. \" H\u00e6c loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruini Dissiluisse ferunt : cum protinus utraque tellus Una foret, venit medio vi pontus, et undis Hesperium Siculo latus abscidit : arvaque et urbes Littore diductas angusto interluit \u00e6stu.\" \u2014 \u00c6n.

The inhabitants as well about the fort, as on the declivities of the moun tain, alarmed by this appearance, betook them selves to flight; but before they could all save themselves, the mountain began to give way, and the greatest part of it actually sell in, and disap peared in the earth. At the same time a tremen dous noise was heard, resembling the discharge of the heaviest cannon. Immense quantities of vol canic substances, which were thrown out at the same time, and spread in every direction, propa gated the effects of the explosion through the space of many miles. \"It is estimated that an extent of ground of the mountain itself, and its immediate environs, fifteen miles long, and full six broad, was by this commo tion swallowed up in the bowels of the earth. Se veral persons sent to examine the condition of the neighbourhood, made report that they found it im possible to approach the place where the mountain stood, on account of the heat of the substances which covered its circumference, and which were piled on each other; although this was the 24th of September, and thus full six weeks after the catas trophe. It is also mentioned, that forty villages, partly swallowed up by the ground, and partly co vered by the substances thrown out, were destroyed on this occasion, and that two thousand nine hun dred and fifty-seven of the inhabitants perished. A proportionate number of cattle was also destroy ed, and most of the plantations of cotton, indigo, and coffee, in the adjacent districts, were buried"], [395, "AQUEOUS ERUPTIONS. 353 under the volcanic matter. The effects of this ex plosion are still very apparent in the remains of this volcano.\" It has been already stated, that the volcanoes in the Andes, more frequently throw out water and mud, than lava. The damage which these aque ous and muddy eruptions occasion is often pro digiously great. Sometimes the deluge of water attending a volcanic explosion, does not come from the interior of the earth, but from the snow which covers the mountain being rapidly dissolved ; but in other instances, it proceeds from the crater. Interior cavities of vast extent and depth contain ing water, are opened during an eruption, and the water coming into contact with ignited lava, is forcibly driven out, and, according to Humboldt, carries along with it a great quantity of small fishes, which he has denominated pimelodes Cyclopum *. These fishes are about four inches in length, and are of the same species that inhabit the neighbour ing brooks and lakes : the number thrown out is sometimes so great, that their putrefaction con taminates the air, and occasions serious maladies among the inhabitants of the adjacent country. Though the water ejected from volcanoes may in many instances be regarded as of accidental oc currence, I conceive it to be different with those muddy eruptions, which cover large tracts of coun try with strata containing bituminous or inflam- * It ought to be stated, that the existence of internal cavities filled with water supplied from the melted snow, is an inference from volcanic phenomena, which, however reasonable it may appear, it is impossible to prove. 2 A"], [396, "354 BOILING SPRINGS. mable matter : these strata are as essentially vol canic products, as the matter thrown out of the volcano of Macaluba in Sicily, which never ejects lava ; and we are hence instructed, that one of the substances which promotes volcanic combustion is bitumen or carbon. The muddy eruptions in the Andes, when first ejected, have little consistence or tenacity ; but they soon become hard, and form what is called by the inhabitants moya ; it is dark coloured and soils the fingers, and is used instead of turf for fuel. Boiling springs, and thermal waters, must be classed with volcanic phenomena ; for it can scarce ly be doubted, that the geysers in Iceland, which throw up columns of boiling water, at intervals, to the height of seventy or eighty feet, are occa sioned by the subterranean fires which extend un der that island : to the same cause must be ascribed the boiling fountains in the Island of St. Michael, one ofthe Azores. The hot springs in the vicinity ofthe Pyrenees, in Italy, and in other parts ofthe world, may with much probability be supposed to have a similar source of heat. The unvaried equality oftheir temperatures for centuries, proves that this source lies far below the agency of those causes which operate on the surface. It has been remarked, that hot springs are most frequent in volcanic and basaltic countries. Though no active volcano exists in the Pyrenees, M. Dralet, in his Description des Pyrenees, says, \" that the hot springs and frequent earthquakes in different parts of this chain, offer proofs of the present operation of subterranean fires.\" Some notice of the ther-"], [397, "ANCIENT VOLCANOES. 355 mai springs in the Alps has been taken, Chap. V. page 105. However powerful the effects of subterranean fire may be in various parts of the globe, we must conclude from the remains of ancient volcanoes, that in a former period, the action of volcanic fire has been far more extensive and intense than at present. According to Breislak, an Italian geologist, in a space of twenty miles in length and ten in breadth, between Naples and Cumea, there are no less than sixty craters, some of them are larger than that of Vesuvius ; one of them is two miles in diameter. The city of Cumea, founded twelve hundred years before the Christian \u00e6ra, is built in the crater of an ancient volcano. In other parts of Italy, there are undoubted vestiges of ancient volcanoes. In Sicily, there are a number of extinct volcanoes, beside those connected with \u00c6tna. Many islands in the Grecian Archipelago are volcanic. There are remains of large volcanic craters in Spain and Portugal : and the extinct volcanic mountains in the middle and southern parts of France, cover several thousand square miles. On the eastern banks of the Rhine, in the Burgan, and the en virons of Andernach, there are numerous extinct volcanoes. It is further to be noticed, that the craters of ancient volcanoes are many of them of far greater size than the present ones. Vesuvius is a compa ratively small cone, raised within the crater of a larger volcano. The cone of the Peak of Tene riffe, according to the description of travellers, 2 a2"], [398, "356 ANCIENT VOLCANOES. stands within a volcanic plain, containing twelve square leagues of surface, surrounded by perpen dicular precipices and mountains, which were the border of the ancient crater. If the opinion of M. Humboldt be correct, all these craters are di minutive apertures, compared with the immense chasms through which, in remote ages, subter ranean fire has forced a passage through the crust of the globe. \" The whole of the mountainous parts of Quito,\" he says, \"may be considered as one immense vol cano, occupying more than seven hundred square leagues of surface, and throwing out flames by different cones, known by the denominations of Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, and Pichincha. In like manner,\" he adds, \"the whole groupe of the Canary Islands is placed as it were on one submarine vol cano. The fire forces a passage sometimes through one, and sometimes through another of these islands. Teneriffe alone contains in its centre an immense pyramid terminated by a crater, and throwing out from one century to another, lava by its flanks. In the other Canary Islands, the different eruptions take place in various parts, and we nowhere find those isolated mountains to which volcanic effects are restrained. The basaltic crust formed by an cient volcanoes seems every where undermined; and the currents of lava seen at Lanzerote and Palma remind us,\" he adds, \" by every geological affinity, of the eruption which took place in 1301 at the Isle of Ischia, amid the tufas of Epimeo.\" ln the preceding part of the present chapter, I have endeavoured to give a succinct account of the"], [399, "ANCIENT VOLCANOES. 357 most important volcanic phenomena. The only formations of hard crystalline rocks in the present day are volcanic; and if we trace the connection that exists between modern and ancient volcanic rocks, and between the latter and the rocks of trap and porphyry, among the ancient rock-formations, we shall extend the dominion of Pluto over a large portion ofthe globe. Many of the ancient volcanic rocks have not flowed in currents from limited apertures, like mo- dern lavas. \"The volcanic porphyries on the back of the Cordilleras,\" says M. Humboldt, \" are un- doubtedly of igneous origin ; but the mode of their formation is not like that of modern lavas, which have been erupted since the excavation of valleys. The action of volcanic fire by an isolated cone or crater of a modern volcano, differs necessarily from the action of this fire, through the fractured crust of the globe.\" It has been observed by the same geologist, that the further back we can trace vol- canic eruptions, the greater is the similarity be- tween their products, and the rocks which are re- garded as the most ancient ; \u2014 hence the countries that have been the seats of ancient volcanoes, are particularly interesting to the geologist. In Au- vergne and the more southern parts of France, there are extinct volcanoes of different ages, cover- ing with their products several thousand square miles. The most recent of these volcanoes has been extinct or dormant since the records of au thentic history, and probably for a longer period. Julius C\u00e6sar, who was encamped on this volcanic"], [400, "358 EXTINCT VOLCANOES IN FRANCE. soil, and has described the country, makes no allu sion to its having been the seat of active volcanoes *. West of the town of Clermont, there is an exten sive granitic plain, rising about sixteen hundred feet above the level of the river Allier. On this plain, there are numerous cones, and dome-shaped hills, varying in height from twelve hundred to two thousand feet ; some of these cones have well-pre served craters, and the cones themselves are chiefly formed of scoriaceous lava. These are the most recent volcanoes of that country; their products differ in no respect from those of modern volca noes, except that the lava may often be observed passing to the state of compact basalt, exactly si milar to many of the basaltic rocks in Great Britain. That these volcanoes are the most recent, is proved by the lava flowing down from them into the pre sent valleys; and hence we are certain, that the eruptions must have taken place, subsequently to the excavation of the valleys. There are other currents of lava from more ancient volcanoes, that have flowed before the valleys were excavated, and form isolated caps on the hills that inclose the pre sent valleys. These currents of lava are composed * I visited the extinct volcanoes of France in the spring of 1822, and published an account of them in the 2nd volume of my Travels, accompanied with cuts, and a section and outline of the country round Clermont, which is I believe the first attempt to render in this manner the structure of this volcanic district intelligible to the general reader. Without the aid of sections and diagrams, it is difficult to obtain a distinct notion of the relative position of the different volcanic formations."], [401, "EXTINCT VOLCANOES IN FRANCE. 359 chiefly of compact basalt: the position of these iso lated caps of basalt, is similar to that on the hill 6, (Plate 3. fig. 2.) but they are not always columnar. The openings from whence these beds of basalt have flowed, cannot be always traced; but as we can observe the change from scoriaceous lava to basalt in the currents of undoubted lava, we cannot hesitate to admit, that the basalt which forms these caps, must have had a similar origin. Under the caps of basalt, there are in many situations thick beds of volcanic tufa, containing bitumen, which will be subsequently noticed. Beside the volcanoes with craters, that have ejected currents of scori aceous lava and basalt, and poured them into the valleys; and beside the more ancient volcanoes, that have formed beds of basalt before the excavation of the valleys, \u2014 there are other volcanic mountains, which have rounded summits or domes, without any perforation or crater, and these are chiefly composed of whitish or gray earthy felspar, con taining imbedded crystals of felspar : to this rock the name of trachyte has been given on account of its rough fracture. It may be properly called a volcanic porphyry. The first, or more recent volcanoes, resemble in every particular the existing volcanoes in various parts of the world ; and the currents of lava may be traced from their sides along the granitic plane on which the volcanoes stand, and thence into the adjacent valleys for many miles. The lava appears as fresh as the recent lavas from Vesuvius, though it has been exposed to the action of the atmosphere for some thousand years. The Puy de Pariou is"], [402, "360 PUY DE PARIOU. the most perfect of these volcanic cones. The fol lowing description of it is taken from the 2nd vo lume of my Travels. \" We were one hour in going from La Barraque, a mountain village, to the foot of the Puy de Pariou, where we left our char, and another hour in ascending to the summit, as we halted several times to rest. As nearly as I could estimate, the summit of this mountain rises about one thousand feet above the plain, and is therefore about three thousand eight hundred feet above the level of the sea. The crater, which is the best preserved of any in Auvergne, is nearly circular. I walked round it, and its circumference is about eight hundred yards. Its shape is that of an in verted cone or funnel quite perfect. The edge or rim of the crater is narrow, from which the descent or slope is very rapid on each side ; the depth of the crater from the highest part of the edge (which is on the southern side) to the small plain at the bottom, may be about three hundred and twenty feet; and from the western side, about two hundred and sixty English feet. The lava which flowed from Pariou to La Barraque, and thence towards the plain of Clermont, is generally supposed to have issued from the crater; but had this been the case, the crater would not have been so entire as it is; and I am fully convinced that the eruption of such a mass of lava, must have broken down one ofthe sides, as at Nugere, which we afterwards visited, and the Puy de Vache. There appears, I think, decisive marks of the lava having flowed from an opening on the north-east side of the mountain, to which it may be traced. Indeed on"], [403, ""], [404, "362 PUY DE PARIOU. this side there are the indications ofa much larger crater, which has its escarpments turned towards the Puy de Pariou like those of Mount Somma, which are turned towards Vesuvius. The Puy de Pariou, was in all probability a volcanic cone formed within the larger crater by its last eruption of scori\u00e6. \" The annexed cut, from a drawing I made near the foot of the mountain, represents the external shape of the Puy de Pariou, and the dotted lines show the form and the relative depth of the crater, the bottom of which, a a, is about three hundred and twenty feet below the highest part of the rim c. The current of lava, b b, is on the north-east side of the present mountain. The internal shape of Pariou approaches to quadrilateral, or is that of a cone compressed on each side, and somewhat elongated from north to south. The bottom of the crater is nearly flat ; there was a little water, from the recent melting of the snow, remaining in some of the hollows : indeed we were told at Clermont, that we should find the crater filled with snow. It was early in May; but the snow was gone, and grass was growing in some parts; others were covered with loose masses of scori\u00e6. Owing to the great porosity of the soil, the crater of Pariou seems doomed to perpetual sterility, \u2014 there is no tree or shrub within it; while that of Vesuvius, after a ces sation of eruptions for only four centuries, was co vered with large chesnut trees.\" \u2014 Vol. ii. page 307. In the Puy de Pariou, and many other volcanic mountains of this district, there is nothing particu larly remarkable, except, that the lavas which have"], [405, "VOLCANOES WITHOUT CRATERS. 363 flowed from them at a remote period, should pre serve all the freshness of recent lavas, and that vol canoes so well characterized, both by their forms and mineral products, should have remained unno ticed until the middle of the last century. The round-topped or dome-shaped hill on the left of the Puy de Pariou is called Sarcoui; it belongs to that class of volcanoes that have no craters, which will subsequently be noticed. The more ancient vol canoes, that have poured out the thick beds of ba salt that cap many of the valleys round Clermont, cannot always be traced, as the openings from whence it issued, may be covered by the lava of more recent eruptions. But in order to obtain a more distinct idea of the position of these caps of basalt, it will be necessary to remark, that the granitic plain above Clermont, and the hollows or valleys in its sides, received their present form prior to the most ancient volcanic eruptions ; these hol lows, or ancient valleys, were probably basins or lakes, in which were deposited a vast thickness of calcareous strata, containing freshwater shells, and the bones of land quadrupeds. Into these lakes, there has flowed a vast mass of volcanic tufa, co vering the limestone, and sometimes intermixed with it. The volcanic tufa, and the freshwater strata, appear to have filled up the ancient valleys or lakes ; and on this tufa, the basalt was deposited by a subsequent eruption. At a later period, di luvial currents have furrowed excavations or new valleys in the basalt, the subjacent tufa, and the freshwater limestone, leaving detached portions or hills, composed of basalt, tufa, and limestone, which"], [406, "364 STRUCTURE OF THE VOLCANIC once were parts of continuous beds. Into these new valleys, the lava of the most recent volcanoes has flowed. The most remarkable circumstance attending these more ancient eruptions, is the bitu minous nature of the tufa, which forms the lowest bed, and covers the freshwater limestone of Ger govia, CanturgEs, and the neighbouring hills. This tufa is in some parts more than three hundred feet thick ; it consists of earthy basalt or wacke, intermixed with lumps of scori\u00e6 and basalt, and in some places with limestone : it is every where im pregnated with bitumen. The tufa of Auvergne bears evident marks of being the product of an aqueous or muddy eruption, intermixed with lava and scori\u00e6, which increase in quantity in the upper part ofthe mass, and at length cover it with com pact lava or basalt. That the tufa was ejected in an aqueous or muddy state is proved, by the quan tity of bitumen which it contains : by any other mode of formation, the bitumen would have been consumed. By some former writers it has been supposed, that the tufa is an alluvial bed of sedi ment, and water-worn fragments ; but the bitumi nous nature of this bed, excludes the probability of this mode of formation ; and at Montadoux, the upper part of the tufa may be clearly seen passing into basalt. In some situations, however, the tufa has been transported from its original situation, and intermixed with fragments of more ancient rocks. The dome-shaped hills without craters, composed of volcanic porphyry or trachyte, have given rise to much speculation respecting their origin. Some"], [407, "365 MOUNTAINS IN AUVERGNE. geologists contend, that they are only the remains of one vast bed of trachyte, of which the other parts are washed away. Others contend, that they are merely portions ofthe granite on which they rest; and that this granite has been wholly or partially fused, and upheaved, by the expansive force of subterranean fire. This mode of formation is ren dered probable, by what may be observed at the Puy de Chopine, which is a mountain standing within a crater ; this mountain is partly composed of unaltered granite and syenite, and partly of vol canic trachyte, and appears to have been upheaved, before the fusion of the granite had been effected. The Puy de Dome near the summit is chiefly composed of whitish trachyte intermixed with un altered granite ; the lower part of the mountain is covered with scoriaceous and compact lava. The dome of this mountain rises 2000 feet above the elevated granitic plain on which it stands, and 4797 feet above the level of the sea : it has no crater or opening on the top ; but Dr. Daubeny says, two streams of lava appear to have pierced the sides ofthe mountain, and to have descended into the val leys. In this respect the Puy de Dome resembles the enormous dome of trachyte on the summit of Chimborazo, twenty thousand feet above the level ofthe sea, which, according to Humboldt, acts me chanically on the neighbouring country, fracturing the strata, and changing the surface of the soil; but it has no permanentopening, neither on its summit nor sides. In some of these dome-shaped hills, the action of subterranean heat appears to have been so intense, as to reduce the whole into a spongy pulverulent mass. But what is remarkable,"], [408, "366 VOLCANIC PORPHYRY. in the middle of this spongy mass, lumps of scori aceous lava are sometimes found. It has been ob jected to the formation of trachyte or volcanic por phyry from granite, that it contains a very small portion of quartz; but in this respect, it resembles many granite rocks in Auvergne, in which the quartz is scarcely perceptible. In the volcanic districts south of Clermont, the porphyry becomes more compact, and assumes the hardest state of that rock ; the base ofthe stone is sometimes green, and the crystals of felspar white: it will receive a fine polish like the green porphyry of the ancients. The basaltic rocks also extend south of Clermont, into the districts called the Velay and Viverrais, and cover a great portion of the soil. Near Mon pezat, Thueys and Jaujac, according to M. Faujas St. Fond, there are small volcanic mountains, with distinct currents of lava, that appear to issue from their feet, and flow into the valleys. The lower part of the lava is scoriaceous, but the upper part is hard sonorous basalt, arranged in columns as perfect as those of Staffa or the Giant's Causeway. We have here a decisive proof of the igneous for mation of columnar basaltic rocks. \" The basaltic formation extends into the South of France, to the borders of the Mediterranean Sea, where, near to Adge, is the extinct volcano of Saint Loup, the cellular lava of which, is employed in the con struction of buildings on the canal of Languedoc.\" \u2014 Daubuisson* . * In the article \" Volcano,\" which I wrote for Dr. Rees's Cy clop\u00e6dia, I endeavoured to collect all the most important details"], [409, "PSEUD0 OR FALSE VOLCANOES. 367 Pseudo Volcanoes. \u2014 To the accidental combus tion of beds of coal, the Germans have given the name of Pseudo volcanoes. There are instances of coal mines having been on fire for many years ; but they are too limited in extent or activity, to bear any comparison with volcanic fires. Near Bilston in Staffordshire, there are coal mines which have been continually burning for a long period; the effect of the fire on the beds of clay deserves notice, as it converts them into a substance resembling jasper. There have been instances of portions of the cliffs of England taking fire spontaneously, and burning for a considerable time ; this is at present the case in a cliff near Weymouth. In the last cen tury, after a hot summer and heavy rains, the cliff near Charmouth in Dorsetshire, took fire, and con tinued burning for several months. When portions of the cliffs near Whitby in Yorkshire fall upon the beach, and become moistened, they are sometimes spontaneously ignited. The same effect takes place in the Staffordshire coal mines : when parts ofthe bed of indurated clay which forms the roof of the coal fall down, and become moistened, it takes fire spontaneously ; and hence this combus tible clay is provincially called tow. All these in stances of spontaneous combustion admit of a satis factory explanation. The cliffs of Charmouth and Whitby are composed of lias clay, much intermixed of volcanic phenomena then known, and have given an account of different experiments made on lava by Spallanzani and others, which the limits of the present volume will not allow me to no tice."], [410, "368 BURNING CLIFF AT WEYMOUTH. with bituminous and carbonaceous matter, and the sulphuret of iron (iron pyrites) : such is also the composition of the inflammable clay which forms the roof of the coal in Staffordshire ; and the clunch clay which forms the cliffs near Weymouth, is ge nerally very similar in composition to the lias clay of Charmouth and Whitby. Iron pyrites abounds in these cliffs; and it is a well known property of this mineral, to decompose rapidly when laid in heaps and moistened with water. During this rapid decomposition, sufficient heat is evolved to ignite the bituminous matter in the clay : and the clay when once ignited, will burn for a long period ; \u2014 this is proved in the process employed for making alum at Whitby. There can be little doubt that this spontaneous combustion might be imitated artifi cially by mixing pyrites and bituminous clay or shale, and moistening the heap with water. The experiment of Lemery is well known : he mixed twenty-five pounds of powdered sulphur with an equal weight of iron filings ; and having made with water a paste of the mixture, he put it into an iron pot covered with a cloth, and buried it a foot under ground. In about eight hours the earth swelled and cracked, and hot sulphureous vapours were exhaled; aflame was observed to issue through the cracks, and the ground was covered with a yellow and black powder : thus a subterraneous fire was produced by the chemical combination of sulphur, iron, and water. In the cliffs of Charmouth, Whitby, and Weymouth, we have precisely the same mi neral substances combined, that are used in the ex periment of Lemery."], [411, "369 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. The earth itself is in all probability the great laboratory, in which, by the aid of subterranean heat, are combined and prepared the mineral sub stances that compose the hard crystalline crust of the globe. All the minerals which form primary rocks, occur in a perfect state in modern or ancient lava. The substances ejected through fissures in the earth, or volcanoes, belong to the four grand divisions of the mineral kingdom, \u2014 the inflam mable, saline, metallic, or earthy. The inflammable substances are sulphur, carbon, and hydrogen. Though sulphur may be one ofthe supporters of volcanic combustion, its inflammable nature prevents its being found in lava in a solid form ; during volcanic eruptions it is evolved in a gaseous state, combined with hydrogen. It is also sublimed from the fissures of extinct or dormant volcanoes, and forms thick incrustations on the sides of the craters. Almost all the sulphur of commerce in Europe is procured from the craters of dormant volcanoes in the South of Italy, Sicily, and the Li pari Islands. When the combustion of sulphur in volcanoes takes place where there is access to at mospheric air, it forms sulphureous acid gas, and sulphuric acid. Carbon combined with hydrogen, forming bitu men, is found in volcanic rocks. The volcanic tufa in the vicinity of Clermont in France, contains so much bitumen, that in warm days it oozes out, and forms streams of bitumen resembling pitch, which is the more remarkable, as this tufa must have been erupted some thousand years. Bitumen has been observed oozing out of the lava of \u00c6tna. The 2b"], [412, "370 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. moya erupted from the volcanoes in the Andes in aqueous or muddy eruptions, contains so much bi tumen or carbon, as to be inflammable. As bitumen exists in many volcanic rocks, the black smoke which issues during an eruption, may proceed from its combustion, though it has generally been sup posed to consist of minute volcanic sand, called ashes. Carbon also combines with hydrogen in a gaseous state, and forms carburetted hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas evolved from volcanoes, or from chasms in the earth during earthquakes, is generally combined with sulphur or carbon ; it is probably formed by the decomposition of water, when it finds access to subterranean fire. Whe ther phosphorus be a product of volcanoes is un known : its extreme inflammability prevents it from being discovered in a concrete form ; but the dense white clouds like bales of cotton, which sometimes cover Vesuvius, resemble the fumes produced by the combustion of phosphorus. Among the pro ducts of volcanoes, only three are combustible at a moderate temperature ; \u2014 sulphur, hydrogen, and carbon. It has been conjectured by Sir H. Davy, that the earths and alkalies which form lavas, exist in the centre of the globe in a metallic state, and take fire by the access of water. This property of the newly discovered metals, to inflame instantly on the access of water, by which they are converted into earths or alkalies, offers an easy explanation of the origin of volcanic fires, could we suppose that substances so extremely inflammable and ox idable, have remained for ages in a metallic state. There may, however, be processes going on in"], [413, "VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. 371 the vast laboratory of the globe, that separate the earths from oxygen, and prepare them for the sup port of volcanic fires, by which they are thrown upon the surface, and thus establish a communi cation between the internal and external parts of our planet. The saline products of volcanoes are not nume rous. The sulphureous and sulphuric acids formed by the combustion of sulphur during eruptions, act upon lavas and rocks, and produce different combi nations, of which the most important are alum, sulphate of magnesia, of iron, or green copperas and gypsum. Muriat of ammonia or sal-ammoniac forms an incrustation on many lavas soon after they cool : muriat of soda or common salt, and mu riat of copper and of iron, are found in the craters of volcanoes. Muriatic acid in an uncombined state occurs in some of the spongy lavas in Auvergne. The principal metallic substances in volcanic rocks, are iron and titanium ; but ores of antimony, copper, and manganese, have sometimes been found in the craters of volcanoes. Tellurium, gold and mercury, are also said to occur in some volcanic rocks. The island of Ischia, which is entirely volcanic, contains a mine of gold. Iron, in the form of brilliant lamin\u00e6, called spe cular iron, occurs in the cavities and fissures of many lavas. Magnetic iron-ore, and oxide of iron, with iron-sand and titanium, form a constituent part of nearly all dark-coloured lavas or basalt. The earthy products of volcanoes are either vi treous, or stony, or scoriaceous, or spongy, or in 2b2"], [414, "372 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. loose grains or powder. Volcanic rocks are com posed chiefly of felspar, and the dark-coloured mi neral called augite ; they contain also hornblende and grains of magnetic iron ore, with titanium and iron-sand, and the mineral called olivine. Mica, leucite, iron pyrites, garnets, rubies, and zircon, are also found in some volcanic rocks. The differ ent states of lava, whether vitreous, compact, or sco riaceous, depend on the different circumstances under which it has cooled. \u2014 See page 213. Volcanic rocks being principally composed of the two minerals felspar and augite very minutely in termixed, they derive their principal characters from the prevalence of one or other of these mine rals. Those lavas in which felspar greatly predo minates/have generally a whitish or grayish co lour, and melt into a white glass. The lavas which contain a large portion of augite, have a dark co lour, and melt into a black glass. According to M. Cordier, all volcanic rocks that have flowed as lava, and which appear the most homogeneous, are composed of microscopic crystalline particles, be longing to a small number of minerals, particularly felspar, augite, olivine, and iron-sand ; and the same intermixture of minerals may be observed in all scoriaceous lava and in basalt. \u2014 See page 18S. To the white or gray lava composed principally of felspar, theFrenchhave given the name of trachyte, from its breaking with a rough surface. Trachyte. \u2014 Common or stony trachyte, has ge nerally a whitish or grayish colour, a dull earthy fracture, and is more or less sine-grained ; some-"], [415, "VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. 373 times the grains are very minute, and it has then a compact surface, and sometimes a glistening lustre, in which state it becomes pearl-stone. Its hardness is variable ; some of the trachytes near Clermont are spongy, and almost friable. Trachyte melts readily into a grayish glass; it generally contains imbedded crystals of vitreous felspar. Acicular or needle-shaped crystals of hornblende, hexagonal crystals of mica, and grains of iron-sand, and la min\u00e6 of specular iron ore, occur in trachyte. Au gite is seldom found in the trachyte of Europe, though it is common in the trachytes of the Andes. The clay-stone of Braid Hill near Edinburgh nearly resembles some of the trachytes in Au vergne, but it is not porphyritic. Trachyte may be regarded as an earthy form of felspar; it is there fore unnecessary to speak of its constituent parts. To the variety of trachyte on the Puy de Dome, M. Von Buch has given the name ofdomite, \u2014 a term which the French geologists have properly re jected, as it is only common trachyte, rather whiter than some of the other varieties. It has before been stated, that the trachytes in Auvergne were probably formed by the more or less perfect fusion of granite; like the granite of that district, they contain but a very small portion of quartz. Trachyte occurs in the Lipari Islands in a per fectly vitreous state, forming obsidian or volcanic glass, which is sometimes colourless, and some timesblack ; the black variety, however, forms a white glass when melted. The colouring matter being fugitive, is probably bitumen : in this respect. it differs from obsidian formed from dark lava or"], [416, "374 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. basalt, the latter melts into a black glass. Pumice appears to have been formed from felspar or tra chyte, exposed to an intense heat, which has re duced it to a fibrous mass. The island of Lipari contains a mountain en tirely formed of white pumice : when seen at a distance, it excites the idea, that it is covered with snow from the summit to the foot. Almost all the pumice-stone employed in commerce, is brought from this immense mine. The mountain is not one compact mass, but is composed of balls or globes of pumice aggregated together, but without adhe sion. From hence Spallanzani infers that the pu mice was thrown out of a volcano in a state of fusion, and took a globose form in the air. Some of these balls of pumice do not exceed the size ofa nut, others are a foot or more in diameter. Many of these pumices are so compact, that no pores or filaments are visible to the eye ; when viewed with a lens, they appear like an accumulation of small flakes of ice. Though apparently compact, they swim on water. Other pumices contain pores and cavities, and are composed of shining white fila ments. By a long continued heat, pumice-stone melts into a vitreous semi-transparent mass, in which a number of small crystals of white felspar are seen. Black or dark-coloured pumice is more uncommon. Humboldt says, he has seen black pu mice in which augite and hornblende may be re cognised; he is inclined to think that such sub stances owe their origin to basaltic lavas, which have assumed a capillary or fibrous form by intense heat."], [417, "VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. 375 Immense quantities of pumice are sometimes thrown up by submarine volcanoes. It has been seen floating upon the sea over a space of three hundred miles, at a great distance from any known volcano ; and from hence it may be inferred, that submarine volcanoes sometimes break out at such vast depths under the ocean, that none of their products reach the surface, except such as are lighter than water. Obsidian or volcanic glass so nearly resembles lumps of black glass, that they can scarcely be dis tinguished by the unpractised observer. Its broken surface is smooth, conchoidal, and shining : the most common colour of obsidian is a velvet black. The thinner pieces are translucent. It is harder than glass, and strikes fire with steel. It is common in the neighbourhood of volcanoes, and in some basaltic formations. The obsidian accompanying basalt, contains a large portion of augite, and melts into a black glass as before mentioned ; in other respects its mineral characters are the same as those of obsidian from trachyte. In Lipari, one of the volcanic isles, the mountain de la Castagna, according to Spallanzani, is wholly composed of volcanic glass, which appears to have flowed in successive currents, like streams of water, falling with a rapid descent and suddenly frozen. This glass is sometimes compact, and sometimes porous and spongy. Numerous veins of obsidian are said to intersect the cone of Mount Vesuvius, and serve as a cement, to keep together the loose materials of which it is composed. On the elevated plain which surrounds the co-"], [418, "376 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. uical peak of Teneriffe, there are masses of obsi dian, which graduates into pitchstone, containing crystals of white felspar. On the south-west side of the peak, there is a stream of vitreous lava or obsidian several miles in length. Colonel Imrie describes a current of lava in the island of Felicuda intermixed with obsidian, which had been flowing with it, and now formed part of the congealed stream. \" In some parts the obsidian is seen losing its brilliancy, and passing into granular lava, which becomes similar in colour, fracture, and texture, to the other parts of the stream. Where the obsi dian appears in a state of perfect glass, it is very near to where it has been first ejected from the side ofthe crater, and in a situation where it must have undergone a rapid cooling. In some parts of these congealed streams, I could trace a transi tion of the obsidian into pumice. In these places, the obsidian contained scattered air globules, which were almost always lengthened in the direction of the stream. These globules gradually augmented in number, until the whole substance became a light, fragile, and frothy pumice*.\" Obsidian is found in the crater of Vulcano, one ofthe \u00c6olian islands, and may be seen forming there at the pre sent time. Rocks of trachyte sometimes, though rarely, have a columnar structure; owing to the facility with which trachyte breaks down, it forms beds of con glomerate intermixed with scori\u00e6 and pumice. The more finely comminuted parts of trachyte, * Memoirs of the Wernerian Society, vol. ii. p. 47."], [419, "377 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. intermixed with earthy matter, form beds of tufa. These beds of conglomerate and lufa frequently environ trachytic mountains, and hide from the view of the geologist, their connection with the subjacent rocks. When trachyte becomes compact and hard, and acquires a laminar or slaty structure, it passes into clinkstone or phonolite, so called on account of its yielding a metallic sound, when struck.\u2014 See Chap. V. where it is observed, that dark lava or basalt also passes into clinkstone. Thus it appears that both the light-coloured lava or trachyte, and the dark coloured lava or basalt, according to the different degrees of heat to which they have been subjected, or the different circumstances under which they have cooled, form volcanic glass, clinkstone, or pu mice; and the only difference to be observed in the minerals formed from the trachyte or the ba salt, is a difference of colour in the minerals them selves, or in the glass which they yield when melted. Black pumice from basalt is however very rare*. * According to the microscopic and mechanical analysis of light-coloured and dark lavas, by M. Cordier,(whether compact or scoriaceous,) it appears that the stony lavas which melt into a white glass, contain ninety per cent of felspar. Those lavas which melt into a bottle-green glass or enamel, contain only from fifty-five to seventy per cent of felspar ; such are the greenish, grayish, or dark-coloured basalt. On a microscopic examination of dark lava or basalt, it appears to consist of mi nute crystalline grains. The whitish grains belong chiefly to felspar, but in the lava from Vesuvius, to leucite ; a small pro portion of these grains are chrysolite. The yellowish or greenish grains belong to augite and hornblende : those of augite are rounded and irregular, with a vitreous fracture, and"], [420, "378 VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. Basaltic dykes, and the overlying rocks of por phyry, trap and basalt, described in the 9th chap ter, ought, I am persuaded, to be classed with an cient volcanic rocks ; but their igneous origin is not yet universally admitted, and it is desirable to separate theoretical views, from a description of facts. This, however, cannot always be done: cir cumstances which indicate the mode of rock-forma tions, will deservedly force themselves on our atten tion ; and in stating them fairly, and the inferences which maybe drawn from them, we relieve Geology from much of its dryness, and stimulate succeeding observers to a strict investigation of nature. Dark-coloured recent lava does not differ essen tially from basalt; it is generally more porous. Pro bably the compact state of basalt was the result of refrigeration under pressure : it may however be frequently observed in Auvergne, passing into the state of scoriaceous lava. Some of the recent lavas from Vesuvius are compact, and have a glistening splendent lustre. The grains of hornblende are long, and assume a prismatic form ; they present indications of a laminar structure, and have little lustre. The perfectly black grains are iron-sand, containing iron, combined with titanium ; the grains of iron ore (fer oligiste) may be known by yielding a red powder when pulverized. Volcanic glass, volcanic scori\u00e6, and volcanic tufa, are all composed of the same minerals as the most compact lava ; and all the most homogeneous dark volcanic rocks, are composed of minute microscopic grains, which are chiefly felspar and augite, with a small proportion of olivine and iron-sand. M. Cordier informed the author, that the microscopic examination of lava was much facilitated, by steeping the piece to be examined in dilute muriatic acid."], [421, "VOLCANIC PRODUCTS. 379 lustre, but they are more commonly porous. In some volcanic eruptions, lava appears to have ac quired the most perfect fluidity. According to Professor Bottis, who was an eye-witness of the eruption of Vesuvius in 1776, the lava spouted from three small apertures, precisely like water, forming beautiful fountains of fire, which described curves of different dimensions as they fell. In the same year, a current of lava from the summit of Vesuvius flowed with the velocity of a mile and a half in fourteen minutes ; it struck upon the lava of 177 J, and rebounded into the air, congealing in figures of various shapes. The length of time which currents of lava retain their heat is truly re markable : the current which flowed from \u00c6tna in 1669 is two miles in breadth, fifteen miles in length, and two hundred feet in depth ; it retains a portion of its heat to the present day. Ferrara says, when this lava was perforated at Catania in t809, flames broke out; and it continued to smoke at the surface after rain, at the beginning of the present century, or 130 years after its eruption. Stones of enormous size are frequently projected from the craters of volcanoes ; but the quantity of matter which they throw out in the state of scori\u00e6, sand and powder, often exceeds that erupted in the state of lava, and is spread over distant countries : by the percolation of water it becomes agglutinated, and forms beds of volcanic breccia and tufa. Some times the tufa is sufficiently solid to be used for building-stone ; the Roman pepperino is a volcanic tufa. Pozzolana consists of minute particles of scori\u00e6, which have been partially decomposed :"], [422, "380 AGE OF VOLCANIC ROCKS. when mixed with lime, it makes a water-setting cement. Some volcanic rocks decompose rapidly, and form productive soils ; others resist the process of decom position so effectually, that after the lapse of some thousand years, they present all the freshness of the most recent lavas. Age of Volcanic Rocks. \u2014 Nothing precise can be determined with respect to the relative age of vol canic rocks, except in those districts where they occur together, one covering the other. Humboldt, who has attempted to trace the different ages of volcanic formations, observes, that there are tra chytes, clinkstones, and basalts, of different ages; but in proportion as we advance towards the more recent volcanic formations, they appear isolated, superadded, and strangers to the soil in which they are found. The lavas from existing volcanoes vary at different periods of their eruptions : we may there fore well conceive, that the volcanic masses which during thousands of years have been progressively raised to the surface, under very different circum stances of pressure and refrigeration, should present striking contrasts and analogies of structure and composition. Observations. From the various phenomena which volcanoes present, we may with probability infer, that the internal part of our planet is either wholly or partially in an igneous state, how ever difficult it may be to explain in what manner this heat is generated and confined. In every department of nature, our inquiries are terminated by ultimate facts, beyond which further research becomes vain. The constant generation and"], [423, "381 ON VOLCANIC FIRE. emission of light from the surface of the sun is more inex plicable and surprising, than the constant generation of heat in the centre of our planet ; but we cannot refuse our assent to the fact, though it is far beyond the power of the human mind to conceive, by what means the particles of light are propelled through space with such astonishing velocity. We are too apt to measure natural operations by their coincidence with the re ceived systems of philosophy, and to make our own ignorance the standard of truth. Had all the volcanoes in the world been dormant for the last two thousand years, and were we only ac quainted with their existence by the writings of ancient histo rians, we should discredit the fact, and prove its impossibility by an appeal to established chemical principles ; we should further accompany the proof with a pathetic lamentation over the credu lity of former times. The descent of stones from the atmosphere was denied during a longer period, though the fact is now esta blished beyond all doubt. Admitting the existence of central fire in the earth, it is not difficult to conceive that there may be determinate causes, by which its intensity is increased or diminished at certain periods. We know little respecting the operation of electric or Voltaic energy in the laboratory of nature, but from the existence of electric light at the poles, we may infer that electric currents are passing through the earth, and are important agents in many subterranean phenomena. Perhaps the different beds of rock which environ the globe may act like a series of plates in the Voltaic pile, and produce effects commensurate with their vast magnitude. Voltaic energy is capable of supporting the most intense degree of heat without access to atmospheric air, or even in vacuo ; and this for an indefinite time. Whatever origin we ascribe to subterranean fire, there can be no doubt that it will make its way through the surface in those places where the incumbent rocks offer the least resistance, or where they are most fusible. By the access of water to this fire, the sudden evolution of steam, hydrogen gas, and many phenomena of volcanic eruptions, will admit of an easy expla nation. Most of the active volcanoes being situated near the sea or great lakes, we may infer that water is in some way neces sary to the production of volcanic phenomena."], [424, "382 CHAPTER XVI. ON THE AGENCY OF SUBTERRANEAN FIRE IN THE FORMATION OF ROCKS AND STRATA. XHE numerous volcanoes scattered over the globe abundantly prove the existence of fire in the deep recesses of the earth. During a former state of our planet, the internal fire must have been more in tense than since the records of authentic history. This is shown by the remains of mighty volcanic craters, which far exceed any that are active at the present time ; for, the craters themselves being formed by the eruption of volcanic matter, their size bears evidence to the magnitude of their former operations. \" Those ranges of volcanoes, those eruptions through vast chasms, those subterranean thunders, that roll under the transition rocks of porphyry and slate in the new world, remind us by the present activity of subterranean fire, of the power, which in remote ages, has raised up chains of mountains, broken the surface of the globe, and poured torrents of liquid earth in the midst of the most ancient strata. Even in our own days, these torrents of melted earth do not always issue from the craters or sides of volcanic mountains. Sometimes the earth opens in plains, and spreads strata of lava or of mud over a vast extent of country.\" \u2014 Humboldt, sur le Gisement des Roches."], [425, "383 VOLCANIC AGENCY. We cannot avoid an inquiry respecting the use of these mighty agents in the \u0153conomy of nature : were we to consider volcanoes merely as the vents for internal fires, a further inquiry would arise re specting the utility of these fires; for we ought not to suppose that the laws which govern the interior of our planet, are not directed by the same wisdom which is displayed in the external world. There are many philosophers who admit in its full extent the doctrine of final causes as evinced in the structure ofa plant, or an animal; or in other words, who readily grant that all the various parts and organs conduce to one definite purpose ; yet they are reluctant to allow that the earth itself is under any other guidance than the brute force of tumultuous elements. I do not however think it unphilosophical to in quire what office subterranean fires have performed in the \u0153conomy of nature : Are they accidental ap pendages, or essential parts of the terrestrial sy stem ? The geologists who exclude the agency of fire from the formation of rocks, seem to forget that the only instances we have of hard and crystal line rock formations are volcanic : beds and strata more than thirty miles in length, and of consider able breadth and thickness, have been spread over the surface of the globe in our own times ; and ac cording to M. Humboldt, the further back we trace these eruptions, the greater is the similarity between the currents of lava and those rocks which are con sidered by geologists as the most ancient. The enormous volcanoes whose craters are many leagues in extent, had doubtless an important office to per-"], [426, "384 VOLCANIC AGENCY. form in nature: and can it be unreasonable to be lieve, that the earth ilself is the great laboratory and storehouse where the materials that form its surface were prepared, and from whence they were thrown out upon the surface in an igneous, aqueous, or gaseous state, either as melted lava, or in aqueous solution, or in mechanical admixture with water in the form of mud, or in the comminuted state of powder or sand? Inflammable and more volatile substances may have been emitted in a gaseous state, and become concrete on the surface. These prim\u00e6val eruptions, judging from the size of the ancient fissures and craters, may have been sufficient to cover a large portion ofthe globe. Nor can it be deemed improbable, that still larger and more ancient craters have been entirely covered by succeeding eruptions. In proportion as the forma tion of the surface advanced, these eruptions might decline, and be more and more limited in their ope ration. It is not necessary to suppose that these subter ranean eruptions consisted only of lava in a state of fusion. The largest active volcanoes at present existing, throw out the different earths intermixed with water in the form of mud. Nor should we limit the eruptions of earthy matter in solution or suspension, to volcanic craters : the vast fissures or rents which intersect the different rocks may have served for the passage of siliceous solutions to the sur face. We know no instances in nature of siliceous earth being held in aqueous solution, except in the waters of hot or boiling springs; and hence it seems reasonable to infer that many siliceous rocks and"], [427, "IGNEOUS FORMATION OF MINERALS. 385 veins may have been deposited from subterranean waters at a high temperature. In other instances, siliceous earth rendered fusible by an intermixture with alkalies and earths, may have been poured over the bed of the ocean, and by gradual refrige ration, the constituent parts may have separated and formed granite rocks, composed of quartz, felspar, mica, and hornblende. We know nothing analogous to the formation of granite by aqueous solution, but many of the products of ancient volcanoes bear a close affinity to granite. Indeed, all the minerals which form the constituents of primary rocks occur in undoubted lava ; and many of them, even mica, are found formed in the slags from furnaces ; which adds a high degree of probability to the igneous formation of the primary rocks, and rocks of sienite and porphyry. Calcareous or cretaceous matter is also ejected during aqueous volcanic eruptions : beds of lime stone may have been formed by similar calcareous eruptions, in which the lime was sometimes in solu tion, and sometimes mechanically suspended ; and the numerous remains of testaceous animals in lime stone, appear to indicate that the calcareous solutions were favourable to the growth of animals, whose coverings contain so much calcareous matter. Nor is it necessary to suppose that these aqueous erup tions were always sudden, and attended with violent convulsions ; for, when a passage was once opened, they may have risen slowly and been diffused in a tranquil state, and by gradual condensation may have enveloped the most delicate animals or vege tables, without injuring their external form. 2 c"], [428, "386 FORMATION OF STRATA The long intervals of repose between the great igneous eruptions, or aqueous eruptions saturated with mineral matter, may have allowed time for the growth and decay of animals whose remains are found in different strata; whilst the formation of other strata may have taken place, under circum stances incompatible with organic existence : and accordingly we find in the rocks most abounding with organic remains, certain strata in which they never or rarely occur. The same agent which enveloped living animals in mineral matter without injuring their external form, appears in some in stances to have immediately arrested the functions of vitality. Petrified fish have been discovered in solid rocks, in the very attitude of seizing and swal lowing their prey. A sudden eruption of a hot fluid saturated with the different earths (or the ele ments of which these earths are formed), might destroy in a moment the animals previously exist ing, and form round them a siliceous or calcareous incrustation, which would protect their remains from further destruction. Werner and the geologists of his school maintain, that all the different rocks that compose the crust of the globe, were originally dissolved in water; and that this water saturated with mineral matter, was capable of supporting animal life : but this is manifestly absurd, unless we suppose that the lives of these animals were pre served by a perpetual miracle*, \u2014 whereas if the * As an instance of the data which Werner assumes as un doubted facts, take the following : \u2014 \"In recapitulating the state of our present knowledge, it is obvious that we know with cer-"], [429, "387 BY IGNEOUS AND AQUEOUS ERUPTIONS. mineral matter in aqueous solution was poured out and deposited by successive eruptions, at distant intervals of time, the different races of zoophytes and testaceous animals might have lived and flou rished in waters like those of our present seas and lakes, and have been destroyed together, by erup tions of mineral solutions, and have been succeeded by a creation of different genera and species. Ages of comparative tranquillity might elapse in the interval between different eruptions, and beds of gravel and breccia be formed, by the disintegration of the higher parts of the earth. These beds might be afterwards covered by, or intermixed with, the crystalline beds from subsequent eruptions ; \u2014 and may we not in this manner explain the alternation or intermixture of crystalline rocks, with those of mechanical formation ? As the strata which cover each other are often composed of very different mineral substances, may we not infer, that the successive ancient eruptions, whether igneous or aqueous, contained at different periods different elementary parts ? At the present day, the lavas of succeeding eruptions, even from the same crater, differ both in external character and constituent parts. Hence we may explain the tainty, that the fl\u0153tz and primitive mountains were produced by a series of precipitations and depositions formed in succession ; that these took place from water which covered the globe, exist ing always more or less generally, and containing the different substances which have been produced from them.

Two or more mineral substances may in some instances have been contained in the same fluid, and separated into different masses or strata by the laws of chemical affinity: but it seems impossible to admit, with the Neptunian geologists, that all the substances which compose rocks and strata were coexistent in the same fluid, and that this fluid, after it had deposited only a small part of its contents, was capable of supporting animal life. The succession of aqueous and igneous eruptions would account for the alternation of igneous rocks, with others of aquatic formation. The occurrence of obsidian and basalt, with clay and sandstone, may be parts of the same series of phenomena ; and thus the two opposing systems of Werner and Hutton may both be true to a certain extent, and agree with existing facts. However vast these operations may appear, they sink into insignifi cance, compared with the bulk of our planet itself. If a three-feet globe were to contain within it a fluid capable of acquiring consistence by exposure to the air, and were this fluid from time to time, to exude through minute cracks or punctures, and form over different parts of the surface, successive coats of varnish, whose aggregate thickness was less than that of a wafer, \u2014 this would be a greater change with respect to the artificial globe, than the formation of all the rocks and strata with respect to the earth. And the numerous dislocations and"], [431, "BY IGNEOUS AND AQUEOUS ERUPTIONS. 389 fractures, by subsidence or other causes, are no more in comparison to the magnitude of the earth, than the cracks or inequalities of this superficial varnish would be to a globe of that diameter. In proportion to the quantity of matter thrown up from the interior of the earth, might be the sub sidence of the surface in other parts ; and as the waters retired further from our present continents, the size of the lakes which then covered them would be diminished : but their number would be increased, and also the number of local, or inde pendent, formations of strata. Similar causes still continuing to operate in different situations, might produce general features of agreement amidst the diversity of rock formations which were taking place. Now this is precisely what we observe in comparing the succession of rocks in distant coun tries. If subterranean fire have acted intensely on any part of the crust of the globe already formed, it may have upheaved the bed of the ocean, and occa sioned subsidences in other parts; and these changes may have been often repeated. According to some recent and interesting experiments of Sir James Hall, the vapour from salt water, intensely heated under pressure, will by passing through loose sand, agglutinate the particles, and form solid sandstone. In this manner the heated and compressed water of the ocean, may have consolidated the loose sand at the bottom, and formed strata of sandstone : there are, however, sandstones which are so pure and crystalline, that we must regard them as original siliceous depositions."], [432, "390 FORMATION OF STP.ATA Granite, porphyry, sienite, greenstone and basalt, pass by insensible gradations into each other, and into rocks known to be volcanic : hence the proba bility oftheir having a similar origin is greatly in creased. And if the internal fires that have acted successively on the surface of the globe, were of vast extent, as the remaining craters indicate, they may also in numerous instances have melted or softened pre-existing rocks and strata, and occa sioned the bending and contortions of the strata, and other phenomena, on which the theory of Dr. Hutton was founded. The defect of that theory consists, I conceive, in extending the operation of this cause, further than existing appearances will support. Were we to admit that rocks were produced by successive igneous and aqueous eruptions, poured through craters and fissures of the surface, these, with subsequent elevations and subsidences of the surface, might be sufficient to explain all the va rious phenomena which the position, contortion, succession, and alternation of rocks and strata pre sent to our notice. In some situations granite mountains are covered with a series of schistose rocks, to which succeeds transition limestone ; and on this are laid the sandstones of the coal forma tion. In other instances these sandstones rest immediately on granite, without the intervention of schistose rocks. Here then we may suppose, that no eruptions of matter took place between the formation of the granite and the sandstone ; while in other situations, a succession of formations had produced all the intermediate rocks. In some"], [433, "BY IGNEOUS AND AQUEOUS ERUPTIONS. 391 countries, the eruption of matter which formed granite, after ceasing for ages, had again taken place; and thus sometimes we find granite covering rocks to which it is most frequently subjacent. To a like cause may we ascribe the occasional appear ance of beds similar to the lower rocks, alternating with or appearing in the upper strata. The sili ceous and calcareous solutions in a state of tran- quillity, might also envelop the fragments and sand from pre-existing rocks, and form the various brec cias and aggregated sandstones. Saline and bi tuminous matter may have been thrown up in detached lakes, and subsequently consolidated, as in the pitch-lake in the island of Trinidad. The local formation of beds of trap alternating with other rocks, has before been alluded to, and the gradation of basalt into clay, or sand, will be con sistent with this mode of formation. Many of the solutions containing terrene matter might be erupt ed at a boiling temperature, like the siliceous water thrown out of the hot springs in Iceland; and on cooling they might deposit their contents, the mat ter from each eruption forming a separate layer or stratum*. * To compare great things with small, \u2014 there is an analogous formation taking place every day, in the channels which receive the boiling waters from some of the steam-engines in the county of Durham. This water contains a large quantity of earthy matter, which is deposited every day, except Sunday, in regular layers that may be distinctly counted, with a marked line for the interval of repose on Sunday, between each week's forma tion : hence the stone got out of these channels, has received from the country people the name of Sunday stone."], [434, "392 FORMATION OF STRATA In some parts of the earth, the quantity of matter thrown out during one eruption, may have been sufficiently great to admit the crystallization of whole groups of mountains : in other instances, it may have been so widely diffused as to form very thin strata. And here it may be proper to remark, that different beds and strata are not arranged in nature in the order of their specific gravity ; the lowest are not always the heaviest : neither are they arranged according to their more perfect crystalli zation ; for, though generally the lower rocks are more crystalline than the upper, we not unfre quently find some ofthe upper strata, more perfectly crystalline than the subjacent rocks. Now if the matter of which the upper and lower rocks are formed, had been co-existent in the same fluid me dium, one or other of the above effects must have taken place ; but if each stratum were formed by a separate eruption and deposition, they might vary both in specific gravity and degrees of crystalliza tion, without any regard to the order in which they were deposited. In endeavouring to trace the causes of very com plicated phenomena, those explanations are to be preferred, which apply to the greatest number of cases, and are consonant with existing or analogous facts. Now I conceive that the alternation of aqueous and igneous eruptions, offers a more satis factory explanation of the formation of rocks, than any that has yet been proposed. At the same time it assigns an office to the immense craters and frac tures which have once perforated or intersected the globe,"], [435, "BY IGNEOUS AND AQUEOUS ERUPTIONS. 393 It is an acknowledged maxim, that Nature, or to speak more correctly its divine Author, does nothing in vain ; \u2014 and can we suppose that the in terior part of the earth is constructed with less skill, than what is evinced in the organization of the simplest animal or vegetable ?

The mineral substances to be described in the present chapter, as forming beds or veins, or irregular masses, or grains imbedded in other rocks, consist of metallic matter either pure or in combination with sulphur, oxygen, or acids. Metallic beds and veins may be regarded as fixed constituent parts of the crust of the globe. The difference of external character between a pure metal and an earth is so great, that we find some difficulty at first in con ceiving how metallic matter can form beds inter stratified with earthy rocks ; but the discoveries of modern chemistry have shown, that metallic and earthy minerals are closely allied. Nothing can appear more essentially different than a piece of polished iron and a piece of marble or limestone : yet if iron be exposed to the action of air and water,"], [437, "395 METALLIC MATTER AND ORES. it is converted into rust, and in this state is known as ochre; and between ochre and powdered lime stone there is little difference of external character ; nor would any one unacquainted with chemistry suspect, that ochre was a metallic mineral. The ochre can, however, be easily reconverted into me tallic iron : but to convert limestone into a metallic substance is a difficult process, \u2014 yet it has been effected; and it is further proved, that all the earths and alkalies are metallic substances combined with oxygen. The metallic nature of the earths being ascertained, we can no longer be surprised that metallic minerals should be found intermixed with earthy minerals in rocks. Iron is found combined with earths in almost all rocks that are not white; and to the presence of iron, they generally owe their colour, whether red, brown, or black. The other metals rarely occur chemically com bined with rocks or strata, but are found either dis seminated in grains or irregular pieces, or forming beds between earthy strata, or filling veins that in tersect rocks vertically or nearly so. The metals, except gold and platina, are rarely found pure, but are generally combined either with sulphur, oxygen, or acids, and in this state are called ores. When the metals occur pure, they are called native metals; thus We have native gold, native iron, &c. Metallic ores and native metals are sometimes disseminated in grains through rocks ; and when they are abundant, the whole mass of the rock is worked as a mine ; but this is seldom the case. Tin-stone, or the oxide of tin, is sometimes disse-"], [438, "396 METALLIC BEDS. minated in grains in granitic rocks in Cornwall, but it is generally in the vicinity of a vein of tin ore that disseminated grains of tin-stone are found in the rock. At Weal Dutchy mine, near Calling ton, silver ore is obtained, both from a vein which intersects the hill, and from the rock itself, at a con siderable distance from the vein. From a section ofthe mine shown me by the proprietor, it appears that in the rock, which is white killas (a silvery clay slate), the ore is disseminated in various parts, or is collected in bunches. The silver is found na tive in filaments, or in the state of vitreous silver ore, black silver, and ruby silver. Gold frequently occurs in grains, disseminated through solid rocks. Considerable masses of metallic ore are sometimes found in rocks, particularly of iron ore ; but these masses are generally formed by the meeting of nu merous veins, or are parts of metallic beds that are greatly enlarged : \u2014 they will be described with beds and veins. Metallic Beds. \u2014 Some metallic ores occur, form ing regular strata in the secondary rocks, or beds in transition and primary rocks. Iron-stone in thin strata alternates with coal, coal-shale, and sandstone, and has been described with the coal strata \u2014 Chap. VIII. pp. 159, 160. Iron ore often forms beds of considerable thick ness, interposed between rocks of gneiss, mica-slate, and slate. Metallic ores in beds or strata may be regarded as constituent parts ofthe rocks in which they occur, and must be cotemporaneous with them : the metallic and the earthy minerals have been de posited at the same time, and have probably been"], [439, "397 METALLIC BEDS. separated by chemical affinity during the process of consolidation. Sometimes the metallic matter is intermixed with a bed of slate, or \"of other rocks, in such abundance, that the whole bed is worked as a metallic ore. When a bed of metallic matter swells out irregularly to a considerable thickness, it forms masses of ore, which sometimes attain the magni tude of small mountains ; \u2014 such are the mountains of iron ore in Sweden and Norway. Metallic beds are, however, of limited extent; they seldom tra verse a whole mountain or mountain range, but they gradually or suddenly become narrow and ter minate, or in the miner's language wedge out. There are few known beds of metallic ores in England ; the principal repositories of metallic matter are in veins. I have however ascertained, that the cop per mines formerly wrought in the transition rocks of Cumberland, were beds of copper pyrites, inter posed between the beds of the mountains in which they were found, and not intersecting them like veins. The beds of rock being highly inclined, the thin metallic beds between them have been mis taken for veins. I believe that several metallic re positories in other counties, which have been de scribed as veins, are in reality beds ; the distinction between beds and veins not being well understood, they are both called veins by working miners. The manganese mines at Doddiscombe Leigh, in Devon shire, are irregular beds of oxide of manganese in red sandstone. Iron ores, particularly magnetic iron ore, frequently occur in beds. The iron mine at Dannemora in Sweden is an enormous bed, which has swelled out to the thickness of one hundred and"], [440, "398 METALLIC VEINS. eighty feet of nearly compact ore. Copper pyrites sometimes occurs in beds ; mercury has also been found disseminated in beds of clay and sandstone. Ores of black oxide of cobalt are found in beds at Alderly Edge in Cheshire. Metallic veins appear to have been originally fissures cutting through different beds of rock, that have been subsequently filled with metallic ores, intermixed with other mineral matter, of a different nature from that of the rock which is intersected. Metallic veins are therefore considered to be of posterior formation to the rocks in which they are found : and where a vein cuts through different rocks, it is evident that its formation must have been more recent than that of the rocks ; but where a vein is found only in one bed of rock, the fissure may have been formed and filled, at the period when the rock was consolidated. Metallic veins are prin cipally found in primary and transition rocks, or in the very lowest of the secondary strata : they are often separated from the rocks they intersect, by a thin wall or lining of mineral substances distinct from the rock, and sometimes also by a layer of clay on each side of the vein. The same substance which forms the outer coat of the vein, is also fre quently intermixed with the ore, or forms layers alternating with it: this is called the matrix, gangue, or vein-stone. It appears as if the ore and the vein stone had been formed over each other, on the sides of the vein, at different times, till they met and filled up the fissure. Sometimes the ore extends in a compact mass from one side of the vein to the other. Not unfre-"], [441, "METALLIC VEINS. 399 quently there are hollow spaces in veins, called druses, which are lined with crystals. In these cavities the most beautiful and regular crystalline forms are obtained. Metallic veins often divide and unite again, and sometimes they separate into a number of smaller branches called strings. A ge neral idea of the manner in which metallic veins intersect rocks, and are sometimes intersected by each other, is represented PI. 4. fig. 5. To what depth metallic veins descend is not known, nor is it ascertained whether they generally grow wider or narrower in their descent. The opinions of miners on this subject are so various, that it may fairly be inferred that they differ in this respect, in different situations. No instances I believe have occurred of a vein being worked out in depth, though it often grows too poor to repay the labour of working deeper : more frequently the further descent of the miner is stopped, by the difficulty of removing the water. Veins are seldom rich in ore near the surface, but increase in richness as they descend, and at greater depths become poorer again. When Pryce wrote the \" Mineralogy of Cornwall,\" it was believed that the richest state of a mine for copper in that county, was from eighty to one hundred yards deep ; and for tin, from forty to one hundred and twenty yards. This account by no means agrees with the present state of the Cornish mines. Copper and tin are procured in considerable quantities at the depth of four hundred and fifty-six yards in the Dolcoath mine. The Ecton copper mine in Staffordshire is now worked"], [442, "400 METALLIC VEINS. at the depth of four hundred and seventy-two yards : it is the deepest mine in England. The deepest mine that has been worked in Europe, or in any part of the world, is one at Truttenberg in Bohemia, which is one thousand yards below the surface. Metallic veins frequently contain different ores at various depths. Iron ore, copper ore, cobalt ore, and silver ore, succeed each other in some of the mines in Saxony. In France there are mines which contain copper ore in the lowest part, silver ore above, and over that iron ore. In Cornwall, blende, a sulphuret of zinc, fre quently abounds in the upper part of veins that be come rich in copper as they descend, the blende rarely continuing to any considerable depth. In the same district tin is also commonly found at a small depth, in veins which afterwards prove rich in copper. \" Among other instances that might be quoted, are the two deep extensive copper mines called Huel Unity, and Cook's Kitchen, both of which were worked for tin at first. In both, the tin was soon extracted ; but it should be noted as an uncommon circumstance, that in the latter mine, after working to the depth of one hundred and eighty fathoms, first through tin and afterwards through copper, tin was found again, and has con tinued down to its present depth of two hundred and ten fathoms from the surface. It ought, how ever, to be added, that some portion of tin was found in different parts of the vein, which may therefore"], [443, "FLAT VEINS. 401 be said to have prevailed more or less from the sur face to the present workings *.\" The thickness of veins, and the quantity and quality of the ore they contain, vary in every mine. Some veins are only a few inches wide ; others are several feet, and sometimes several yards, in width. Veins are often narrow in one part, and swell out in another. The vein at the Dolcoath mine in Cornwall varies from two or three feet, to forty feet, and in some places it contracts to little more than six inches. The vein-stone is quartz, in which are imbedded masses called bunches of copper pyrites, consisting of copper united with sulphur. Beside rake veins, there are other mineral repo sitories, called flat veins, or flat works and pipe veins. In some instances a rake vein declines from its re gular inclination, and has taken the direction of the beds or strata for a greater or less extent, and then resumes its former inclination. In other instances the cavities between beds or strata are filled with metallic ores, lying between an upper and lower stratum, like a seam of coal, and are subject to simi lar dislocations : but these are not regular strata ; they may frequently be traced to a perpendicular or rake vein, from which they appear to be lateral expansions ; see Plate 7. fig. 2. There is generally what is called a rider, or mass of mineral matter between the ore of very strong rake veins, and that in the flat veins, at the place of junction. The flat veins that run parallel between the strata, * Transactions of the Geological Society, vol. ii. 2 D"], [444, "402 PIPE VEINS. frequently open into large cavities filled with ore and vein-stone : these cavities close again by the contracting, or what the miners call twitching of the sides, by which the ore is nearly or totally ex cluded. Such expansions and twitchings are also common to rake veins, and are represented at c c, Plate 4. fig. 4. The blue John or fluor spar mine near Castleton is of this kind. The vein which contains this spar is separated from the limestone rock by a lining of cawk or sulphat of barytes, and by a thin layer of unctuous clay ; it swells out into large cavities, which contract again and entirely exclude the ore, leaving nothing but the lining of the vein to con duct the miner to another repository of the spar. The crystallizations and mineral incrustations on the roof and sides of the natural caverns which are passed through in this mine, far exceed in beauty those of any other cavern in England ; and were the descriptions of the Grotto of Antiparos trans lated into the simple language of truth, I am in clined to believe, it would be found inferior in magnificence and splendour of mineral decoration, to the natural caverns in the fluor mine. This mine is rarely visited by travellers : the descent is safe, but the roof being low in some parts it is rather difficult of access. The pipe vein may be described as a tubular mass of ore and vein-stone, generally descending in the direction of the beds, and widening and contracting in its course. In reality, the pipe vein is a variety of the flat vein, having the sides closed"], [445, "403 JUNCTION OF VEINS. or twitched in, so as to form a tube or cavity of irregular shape, and of very limited extent along the line of bearing, but descending to a great depth. One metallic vein often crosses or cuts through another, and displaces it : in such instances it is evident that the vein which is cut through, must be more ancient than that which intersects it. This observation respecting the relative ages of veins was first made by Mr. Pryce in his Mineralogia Cornubiensis. The different position of veins is represented in Plate 4. fig. 4, where a a is a vein intersecting a rock ; it divides in part of its course and unites again, and finally branches off into small strings. In many instances these strings lead to a further continuation ofthe vein ; perhaps this would be found to be the case in all, were the workings carried on in the same direction. 6 6 is another vein which cuts through the former, and has thrown the lower part of the vein _ out of its course. Sometimes one vein passes through an other without changing its direction. When one vein crosses another which has an opposite incli nation, it is observed that they often become poorer ; but when two veins which have the same general inclination unite, they are most frequently very rich in ore at the junction ; (Plate 7. fig. 4. a and _,-) and when a number of veins cross each other at one place, they sometimes form a cone or mass of ore of prodigious size, widening as it de scends. Such are called accumulated veins. They occur in the mining district of Durham and North umberland, in the metalliferous limestone. The excavation formed when the ore is worked out re- 2 d 2"], [446, "404 DIRECTION OF VEINS. sembles in shape the inside of a large glass fur nace. The masses of ore formed by the junction of numerous veins converging to one place, are very different from the masses of ore formed by the swelling out of one metallic bed before de scribed. The direction of rake veins is not very regular. In England, the principal veins generally run nearly east and west, and north-east and south-west ; but have frequently undulations and deviations from a straight line : the most powerful veins are more regular in their course than smaller ones. Where two veins in the same district have the same direc tion, or run parallel, it is observed that their con tents are similar ; but where they run in different directions, the contents vary. Molina, in his inter esting History of Chili, mentions a vein of silver at Uspalata, in the Andes, which is nine feet in thickness throughout its whole extent, and has been traced ninety iniles. Smaller veins branch off from each side of it, and penetrate the neigh bouring mountains to the distance of thirty miles. It is believed that this vein stretches to the distance of three hundred miles. A vein called the Tids well Rake, in Derbyshire, extends some miles east and west ; it is worked from the surface, and may be seen near the road side, between Great Hucklow and Tidswell. I was informed in Cornwall, that no vein in that county had been traced in length more than two miles ; nor had any vein been worked out in depth : the common width ofthe veins is from one to two feet, but sometimes it exceeds 30 feet. In Cornwall and Devonshire, and in the mines"], [447, "CROSS COURSES. 405 of Northumberland and Durham, the principal metallic veins range nearly east and west. In the former counties they are called lodes, in the latter right running veins. The north and south veins which intersect them are called cross courses; these are seldom productive of ore. The thin cross courses filled with clay are called fluan. I was in formed by an intelligent proprietor of mines in Cornwall, that these thin cross courses invariably displace the veins, and hold up the water on one side of the vein ; but it is most worthy of notice, that a vein which is rich in ore on one side of the fluan, will be poor on the other. Query, Is this connected with the fluan holding up the water? In Cornwall the cross courses displace the east and west veins ; the displacement is only a few inches in some veins, in others it is several fathoms. On Alston Moor in Cumberland, a large cross course called Old Carr's cross vein, cuts through two veins called Goodham Gill vein and Grass Field hill vein, and has thrown them aside about fifteen or twenty fathoms. When the cross course intersects the east and west veins at right angles, the displacement is generally less, than when it strikes it in an oblique direction. This effect will be more clearly con ceived by referring to Plate 7. fig. 3. which is supposed to represent a ground plan of the prin cipal veins intersected by a cross course. In Northumberland and Durham, cross courses contain ore, near their junction with powerful veins. In Cornwall, ores of silver and cobalt have been found in some of the cross courses; and at the Botallack mine, north of the Land's End, a"], [448, "406 THE BOTALLACK MINE. powerful cross course, running north and south, is made rich by the junction of east veins, which re semble small rivulets, opening into a river. Their position will be better understood by referring to Plate 7. fig. 6. The direction ofthe cross course or great vein running north and south, is repre sented by the letters N.S. the direction of the small veins, rich in ore, which open into it, are re presented by _ e e. The cross course is rich in ore, to the distance of twenty or thirty fathoms, on each side of its junction with a vein ; but no veins are found branching from the west side of the cross course. The cross course is worked in those parts, where it is- rendered rich by the junction with veins ; the small veins are also worked for ore, and are very productive. The rock is what is called a free or soft killas, near the great cross course or vein ; but further from it, it becomes a hard blue Elvan flinty slate. The width of the vein varies from nine to twelve feet. It contains gray copper ore of a rich quality. Sometimes the sides of the vein are copper ore, and the middle is tin ore, as represented Plate 7. fig. 7, which is a vertical section of part of the vein ; fig. 6. is an hori zontal section. The master of the mine furnished me with the above particulars; and under his direc- tion, I made, on the spot, the two rough sections, which will serve to convey a better notion of this singular metallic repository, than can be obtained by a verbal description. Nor should it be omitted, that the entrance of this mine is at the foot of a precipice more than 200 feet in height, on the border of the Atlantic"], [449, "407 THE BOTALLACK MINE. Ocean, and the workings of the mine extend two hundred and thirty yards under the sea. From this submarine recess, I saw rise up, one of the best formed and noblest-looking men I ever beheld, \u2014 a perfect model for the Apollo of a sculptor. Particular metallic ores are peculiar to certain rocks. Thus, tin-ore occurs in granite and some kinds of slate, but has never been found in lime stone. Certain ores are not unfrequently associ ated together : thus lead and zinc often occur in the same vein, but in different proportions. The same metal in various combinations is often found in one vein : thus native copper, sulphuret of cop per, carbonate of copper or malachite, sulphat of copper or blue vitriol, and copper combined with lead and iron, frequently occur together in the same mine. Galena, a sulphuret of lead, is often associated with white lead ore, or carbonate of lead. The latter, though a rich ore containing seventy per cent of lead, has no metallic appearance, and was mistaken for cawk, and thrown away, by the miners in Derbyshire, until the year 1803 or 1804. The mines of that county have been worked ever since the time of the Emperor Adrian, and the quantity of ore which has been wasted during that period must have been immense*. * In 1810 few of the working miners could distinguish com pact white lead ore, from cawk or sulphat of barytes ; their spe cific gravity and appearance are not very different. The follow ing test is of easy application, and will serve to discover the presence of lead : \u2014 If a small quantity of flowers of sulphur, mixt with a little potash or soda, be melted on the point of a"], [450, "408 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. In what manner metallic veins were filled with ore has greatly divided the opinions of geologists. Dr. Hutton supposes that both dykes and veins were filled with their contents in a state of fusion by injection from below, the expansive force of the melted matter having cracked the surface, and opened a passa'ge for its reception. That many dykes were so formed I think probable, from cir cumstances previously stated. Other dykes appear to have been open fissures filled by materials washed from the surface, and contain rounded stones and sometimes undecayed vegetable matter. From a dyke of clay in a coal mine in Yorkshire, two hundred and fifteen feet deep, I have drawn out long vegetable fibres, apparently roots ; the woody part of which was unchanged, and burned like the roots of common weeds. Werner sup poses all veins and dykes were first produced by the shrinking of the materials of which mountains are composed ; and that metallic veins have been filled from above by the ores in a state of solution. This theory has been advanced with much confi dence, and warmly supported by manv geologists : but I have no hesitation in asserting, that it is de monstratively repugnant to facts : indeed, the im plicit credit which has been given to Werner's dogmas on this subject, is one, among numerous instances, of men of distinguished talents resigning their judgement to authority, and supporting the knife, in a candle, and applied to the moistened surface of the stone, it will make a black spot if the mineral contain white lead ore."], [451, "FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. 409 mostabsurd propositions, when conformable to their favourite hypotheses. If veins were filled by me tallic solutions from above, these solutions must have covered the highest mountains over the whole earth ; and instead of finding metallic ores in ihe present confined repositories, they would fill all the cavities and valleys in every part of the world. As this theory supposes likewise that veins were formed at different times, a number of these me tallic solutions would succeed each other, and we should find regular strata of ore in all primary and transition rocks ; and the quantity formed by these deep seas of metallic matter, would be inconcei vably great*. This theory is decidedly invalidated by the fol lowing facts. When a metallic vein passes through different kinds of rock, it is generally observed that the quality of the ore varies with that of the rock through which it passes ; and even different beds ofthe same rock are more productive than others, and are called by miners bearing measures. This is the case in Durham, Derbyshire, Cornwall, and probably in every mining district in England and Wales. Not only does the variation in the nature of the rock occasion a change in the quantity or quality of the ore, but the mineral substance or matrix * Metallic ores may, in some instances, have been formed in fissures which were once open at the top, or veins may have been re-opened by a subsequent convulsion.

Quartz and barytes are more frequent in granite and slate rocks, than calcareous spar. In calcareous mountains, quartz is more rarely the prevailing matrix. In the counties of Durham and Northumberland, veins pass through siliceous sandstone, argillaceous shale, and lime stone. See Plate 7. fig. 2. The ore is more abun dant in the limestone than in the sandstone, and in the shale provincially called plate, ore very rarely if ever occurs. In one mine at Welhope, the ma trix of the vein, as it passes through the sandstone, is cawk or the sulphat of barytes ; but when it enters the limestone, it changes to carbonate of ba rytes in balls, having a radiated diverging structure. But what is still more deserving of notice, when the rock on one side of a vein is thrown up or down considerably, so as to bring a stratum of limestone opposite a stratum of sandstone, or when what are called the walls or cheeks of the vein are of two different kinds of stone, (see Plate 7. fig. 5.) the vein is never so productive in ore, as when both sides of the vein are of the same kind. This fact alone seems sufficient to invalidate the theory of Werner, that veins were filled with metallic solu tions poured in from the upper part. Had this been the case, the nature of the rock could have made no difference in the quality or quantity of the ore. Werner in his Treatise of Veins, states one instance, as if it were extraordinary, of the ore changing its quality, as the vein passed through different rocks ; and is inclined to admit that elec tive affinity for the rock, may have contributed to"], [453, "411 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. the effect. The circumstance, so far from being extraordinary, is of common occurrence, and known to all working miners. The entire cessation of the ore in one part of a rock, and its re-appearance below, are still more striking. In Derbyshire the beds of metalliferous lime stone, are separated by beds of basaltic rock called toadstone*. When a vein of lead is worked through the first limestone down to the toadstone, it ceases to contain any ore, and often entirely dis appears : on sinking through the toadstone to the second limestone, the ore is found again, but is cut off by a lower bed of toadstone, under which it appears again in the third limestone. In strong veins, particles of lead occur in the toadstone, but in very small quantities. If mineral veins were filled from above by me tallic solutions, it is impossible to conceive that the nature of the rock should change the quality of the * The fact of metallic veins being entirely cut off by the beds of toadstone, has recently been doubted ; it is supposed that the vein is continued through the toadstone, though it contains no ore : but the fact of veins being cut off by the seams of clay between the strata (called way-boards) has not been denied, that I know of. The last time I was in Derbyshire, I endeavoured, but in vain, to obtain correct information respecting the veins being entirely cut through by the toadstone. There is at the present time, a vein working in what is called toadstone, above the village of Matlock ; but the stone is a softish green argilla ceous stone, intermixed with limestone. If the way-boards of clay cut through the metallic veins, the conclusions to be drawn from the fact, are the same as if they were cut through by toadstone. I have therefore left the description of the Der byshire veins unaltered from the former edition."], [454, "412 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. ore ; much less could the ore disappear in one stratum, and appear again in a stratum below it. Nor could the vein be filled with melted matter ejected from below ; for in either case it would be equally impossible to explain why the ore is sepa- rated by the toadstone, though the vein is conti- nued through it. See Plate 4. fig. 5, where b b b are three beds of limestone divided by beds of toad- stone e e, and covered by sandstone. When the vein descends to the first bed of toadstone e, it entirely disappears ; but on sinking through to the second bed of limestone b, the vein is found again ; it dis- appears a second time at the next bed of toadstone, and reappears in the lower limestone. Another vein, a a, is supposed to penetrate the beds of toad- stone e c, but contains no ore where it passes through them. The upper part of the vein _ isrepresented as penetrating the superincumbent sandstone, which is sometimes the case : in this part of the vein the most curious productions of the Odin mine near Castleton are discovered. In some situations, where the beds of limestone are divided by seams of clay, provincially called way-boards, these way-boards cut off the vein as effectually as the toadstone. Such facts prove that these veins were not filled from above. Professor Jameson has conjectured that the beds of toadstone and limestone in Derby- shire, with the metallic veins, were all cotempora neous, and that the toadstone crossed through the veins, at the time of their formation ; but the dif ferent organic remains in the upper and lower beds of limestone preclude the possibility of their having been formed at the same time. The zoophytes in"], [455, "413 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. the lower bed of rock could not be living and co existent with the shell-fish in the upper, nor with the vegetable remains occasionally found in the sandstone which frequently covers the whole, and into which the veins sometimes shoot. Cuvier has well observed, that the existence of different or ganic remains offers incontestable proofs, that the upper and lower strata in which they were found, were formed in succession. If metallic matter were not poured in from above, nor ejected from below, in what manner did it come into the vein ? \u2014 The state of chemical sci ence, and the facts at present known, are too li mited to furnish a solution to this interesting ques tion. There are, however, certain indications which may serve as a clue to future discovery. The variation of the mineral products in veins as they pass through different strata, seems to prove, that the strata were efficient causes in producing this variation. Perhaps metallic matter was diffused through different rocks according to their elective affinity, and separated from them by voltaic elec tricity, the different sides of the vein possessing different states of electricity ; or the strata may act like a series of plates in the voltaic pile, separating and secreting metallic matter from its different combinations. Some of the metals and other sub stances found in veins, are capable of solution in hydrogen gas, and perhaps all of them may be so by natural processes ; in this state they may have penetrated the vein and deposited their contents. The discovery of the metallic nature of the very earths of which rocks are composed, and the pro-"], [456, "414 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. bability that the metals themselves are compound substances of which hydrogen forms a part, open new views respecting the formation of metallic matter by natural processes, which may be within the reach of human power to develop, if not to imitate. If metallic matter be now forming in mines, the process of its formation is extremely slow ; but there are circumstances which appear to prove that it may in some instances be perceived. Mr. Trebra, director of the mines in Hanover, informed a gen tleman of my acquaintance, that he had seen a lea ther thong suspended from the roof of a mine, coated with silver ore : he has also observed native silver and vitreous silver ore coating the wooden supports left in a mine called Dreyweiber, in the district of Marienburgh, which had been under water two hundred years, and was opened in 1777. Mr. Trebra was led from his own observations on mines to infer, that metallic ores are formed by mineral exhalations, or were once in a gaseous state. Mr. Westgarth Forster, a practical miner in Northumberland, states, that at Wolfclough mine, in the county of Durham, which was closed for more than twenty years, and opened again, needles of white lead ore were observed projecting from the walls, more than two inches in length. These and other phenomena observable in mines, may convince us that there are processes going on at present in the great laboratory of the earth, and perhaps there are analogous processes taking place in the atmosphere, which may throw some light on these hidden operations of nature. The formation"], [457, "415 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. of saline matter on the surface of walls, is a fact which merits more attention than it has hitherto received. Dr. Kidd, of Oxford, has published some very ingenious observations and experiments on the spontaneous production of nitre on limestone, which may lead to more important results than the learned Professor appears to have anticipated. These experiments show, that neither the alkali nor the acid exists previously in the stone. Nor do they exist ready formed in the moisture ofthe atmo sphere, dry frosty weather being particularly fa vourable to the rapid production of nitre, and moist weather the contrary. When a portion of the wall was protected from access to the atmosphere by glass, which projected a little distance from the surface, the formation of nitre went on for a certain time and then ceased. The saline crystals were better defined and longer than on the other parts of the wall. When the wall was coated w rith paint, crystals of nitre were even formed on the paint. The formation of carbonate of lead on the walls of the mine at Wolfclough may be analogous to the formation of nitre ; and in both instances, the surface of the wall and of the atmo sphere, may perhaps be considered as two galvanic plates in action, decomposing and recompounding the elements of metallic or saline matter from the atmosphere, or the gaseous fluids with which it is intermixed. The base of nitre (potassium) is known to be a metal ; and could we seize nature in the act of producing a fixed alkali from more simple ele ments, we might compel her to reveal the process by which she prepares her metallic treasures in the"], [458, "416 FORMATION OF METALLIC VEINS. deep recesses of the earth. Nor can the discovery be very remote ; for we are already acquainted with the composition of the volatile alkali, and are thereby enabled successfully to imitate nature in its formation. When the matrix, or the substance which prin cipally fills veins, is a soft unctuous clay, masses and particles of ore are often disseminated through it, varying in size from a pea to that of a large gourd, and are sometimes even of many tons weight. Masses of vein-stone are also imbedded in the same manner; and it is observed that the masses both of ore and vein-stone are of no determinate shape, and have generally the appearance of being corroded. Are we to conclude in such instances, that the hard minerals and metallic ores, have been formed in the substance of the clay by some peculiar elective affinity, or that they once occupied the cavity of the vein, and have been all subsequently decomposed, except the remaining detached masses ? I should be more inclined to adopt the former opinion ; but it must be allowed, that there are inexplicable in stances of the disappearance of minerals which for merly existed in veins. The formation of one mineral upon the crystals of another, and the disappearance of the crystal which has served as the mould, is indeed a common phenomenon in many English mines. I have be fore me a mass of rock crystal from Durham, formed on cubic fluor spar ; but the crystals of the latter have entirely disappeared, leaving nothing but the impression oftheir form. In the mines of Derby shire, incrustations of calamine are formed on cal-"], [459, "417 STREAM WORKS. careous crystals, taking the shape of the dog-tooth spar ; but in these false crystals no trace of the inte rior crystal is left. Certain local causes also appear to influence the crystallization of minerals in differ ent districts, and dispose them to take peculiar se condary forms, which may be considered as appro priate to the minerals of that district. The pyra midal crystallization of carbonate of lime, called the dog-tooth spar (Chaux carbonatee metastatique of Haiiy), is abundant in some of the mines of Der byshire ; whilst the same mineral, rarely assumes that form in the mines of Northumberland and Durham, but is crystallized in other forms, which are equally rare in the Derbyshire mines. Fluor spar, and barytes spar, have appropriate forms in different districts, from which any deviations may be considered as varieties. The causes which oc casion this diversity of secondary forms in minerals, whose constituent parts appear by chemical ana lysis to be precisely the same, are unknown ; nor are we able to explain in what manner the crystals before mentioned have disappeared : but these facts prove, that the powers of nature extend beyond the present limits of science ; and it is more consonant with the true spirit of philosophy frankly to acknow ledge our ignorance, than to form systems from im perfect data, which can only serve to perpetuate error. Metallic ores in rounded fragments, and grains of native metals, are frequently found in the sands of rivers ; they have been carried there by torrents or inundations ; the rocks in which they were ori ginally formed, having been disintegrated or decom- 2 E"], [460, "418 STREAM WORKS. posed. The metals gold, and platina, being inde structible by the action of air, water, or the mine ral acids, remain for ages unchanged, in the form of minute grains. The oxide of tin is a very heavy and hard mineral ; and it is owing to its weight and indestructibility, that it is found in the sands of rivers, or on the sea shore, where it sometimes oc curs in considerable quantities, and is separated from the sand or alluvial soil, by directing streams of water over it ; hence such works are in Cornwall called Stream Works. With the pebbles of tin stone, there are fragments of granite and other rocks, which serve to indicate from what mountains in the vicinity the stream tin has been washed out. Particles and small pieces of gold are sometimes found with stream tin, in the sands of Cornwall. Mr. Hennah, of Plymouth, has in his collection several pieces of native gold, varying from the size ofa bean to that of a hazel-nut ; they were found in stream works near St. Austel : he has also a spe cimen of stream tin, eight or nine inches in length, and five or six in breadth, which was evidently once part of a vein. In the same stream work they could distinguish at different depths, the different veins from which the ore had been washed out. The pebbles of tin ore, have in some situations been washed into the sea, and afterwards covered by beds of clay or gravel. In Mount's Bay, south of the town of Penzance, there was formerly a bed of stream tin worked under the sea. The stream tin covers the killas or slate rock of the country, and is covered by a bed of clay : a perpendicular shaft or tunnel was sunk through the clay, and the bed"], [461, "419 REPOSITORIES OF METALLIC ORES. of stream tin was worked like a bed of coal, the clay forming the roof. See Plate 7. fig. 8. The work ings were continued under the sea, but were at length inundated and discontinued. The following is a summary account of the rocks and situations in which the different metallic ores are generally found : Platina and the recently discovered metals called palladium, rhodium, osmium, and iridium, have only been found in the sands of rivers. Gold and silver are found in primary and transi tion rocks, in porphyry and sienite, and in the lowest sandstone. Gold has been occasionally discovered in coal, and very abundantly in the sands of rivers, and sometimes in volcanic rocks. Mercury is found in slate, in limestone, and in coal strata. Copper, in primary and transition rocks, in por phyry, sienite, and occasionally in sandstone, in coal strata, and alluvial ground. Masses of native copper of many thousand pounds weight, are said to be found on the surface in the interior of North America. Iron, in every kind of rock. Tin, in granite, gneiss, mica-slate, and slate. Lead and zinc, in primary and transition rocks, except trapand serpentine; in porphyry and sienite; in the lowest sandstone, and occasionally in coal strata. Antimony, in primary and transition mountains, except trap and serpentine; it is also found in por phyry and sienite. Nickel, bismuth, cobalt, in primary mountains, 2 e 2"], [462, "420 REPOSITORIES OF METALLIC ORES. except limestone, trap, and serpentine. Cobalt and nickel also occur in transition mountains, and in sandstone. Arsenic, in primary and transition mountains, and in porphyry- Manganese, in primary and transition mountains, and occasionally in the lower stratified rocks. Molybdena and tungsten, uranium and titanium, in granite, gneiss, mica-slate, and slate.

Beside the causes which at present operate to re duce the most exposed and prominent parts of the earth's surface, and transport their materials into plains, or to the sea shore, there are evident indi cations of the destructive effects of ancient inunda tions, which have swept over the surface of the present continents, have excavated new valleys, torn off the summits of the loftiest mountains, and"], [464, "422 DESTRUCTION OF MOUNTAINS. spread their ruins in immense fragments over di stant regions. The sand, soil, or fragments, brought down by rivers, and spread along their banks or at their mouths, are called alluvial depositions. The blocks of rock, and the beds of gravel spread or scattered on the surface of the ground, composed of stone or fragments foreign to the district in which they are spread, and which frequently cover the bones of unknown species of quadrupeds, are called diluvial depositions, viz. depositions which have been formed by a deluge. We shall first consi derthe causes which are at present wearingdown the surface of islands and continents : these are some times adequate to produce the most tremendous effects, and to overthrow mountain masses of im mense magnitude. By considering these effects, we shall be better prepared to admit the mighty action of diluvial agency in remote epochs. Indeed it is not always easy, to distinguish with certainty the effects of alluvial from diluvial agency. We have, however, incontestible evidence, that the disinte gration of mountains has been effected by both causes. Instances have occurred in our own times of mountains suddenly falling down, and burying the inhabitants of the vales below, under their ruins. In the Alps, the process of disintegration is rapidly going on ; but such is the immensity of these enor mous mountains, that ages pass away, before any diminution oftheir bulk is perceived. According to the account of Patrin, who had travelled in Northern Asia, the whole of that coun try is covered to the depth of many hundred feet"], [465, "DESTRUCTION OF MOUNTAINS. 423 by innumerable beds of micaceous and argillaceous sand, washed down by inundations from the high range of mountains in the interior of Asia, and carried as far as Siberia. The deserts of Arabia are also covered with alluvial or diluvial depositions. C. Leckie, Esq. informed me, that between Hit and Tahiba, the soil is composed of sand and gravel, on which may be seen small volute and bivalve shells ; but the sand is not loose like that in the deserts of Libya. That the mountains of our island have once been much higher than at present, is evident to every one who has attentively examined them. The rocky fragments in Borrowdale, the deep ravines made by torrents in the sides of Skiddaw, the immense blocks of granite from Westdale Crag in West moreland, scattered over the neighbouring counties, offer striking proofs of this. The central parts of England have also once had a greater elevation. The white quartz pebbles and fragments of quartz rock, sienite and flinty slate, spread over the mid land counties, are the remains of the decomposed hills in Charnwood Forest, and of others once con nected with them, which are now worn down. Beds of flint-gravel, are formed by the disintegra tion of chalk rocks, in which flints are imbedded, as may be seen on the sea shore under chalk cliffs ; but beds of flint-gravel, are also spread over many parts of England distant from chalk rocks, and at a considerable elevation above the level of the sea. Hence we have evidence that chalk rocks once covered a larger portion of England than at pre sent. It is however in the vicinity of the Alps"], [466, "424 DESTRUCTION OF MOUNTAINS. that the disintegrating- effects of the elements, and those of diluvial agency, are most strikingly dis played. Innumerable blocks of primary rocks torn from the central range of mountains, are spread over the calcareous mountains, and in the valleys, to the distance of one hundred miles or more from their native beds. Blocks of great size are also found immediately under the mountains from whence they have fallen, or scattered over the sur face of glaciers; and as the lower parts of the gla ciers are gradually melting, the upper parts pro gressively move down into the valleys, and deposit the fragments in heaps at their feet : \u2014 these deposi tions of stone are called morains. The destruction of granitic and schistose mountains, that are di vided by nearly vertical seams or partings, is often rapidly effected ; water, insinuating itself into the interstices or seams, becomes expanded by frost, and tears down great masses of rock, with a sudden explosion like that of gunpowder. The overthrow of calcareous rocks is effected in a different manner, and the vast eboulements which they occasion, are more terrific and destructive than the eboulements from the primary mountains, as they generally take place in more thickly inhabited districts. The destruction of the calcareous mountains in the Alps, depends on the peculiar composition and structure of these mountains. In the year 1821, I passed a great part of the summer in examining the calcareous mountains in Savoy ; the structure of which was then not understood, or at least had not been described in any geological work that I had met with. It was generally believed that the cal-"], [467, "425 DESTRUCTION OF MOUNTAINS. careous mountains were entirely composed of beds of limestone, with lofty mural precipices on the up per part ; and that the lower parts, sloping from these precipices, were formed of the debris of the limestone. So far from this being the case, the calcareous mountains of the Alps, which comprise all the English formations, from the magnesian limestone to chalk, alternate like the English forma tions, with enormous beds of shale and soft sand stone ; and it is to this alternation, they owe the fre quent destruction of the upper parts of the moun tains. If all our English secondary formations were by some powerful cause elevated six or seven thou sand feet above their present level, and the beds bent into curves constituting several ranges of mountains, we should have precisely what is found in the calcareous ranges of the Alps. This arched form of the calcareous mountains is represented Plate 2. fig. 1. and fig. 2. x, y. Now if one thick bed of limestone, or a portion of it, be broken off as at z, fig. 2, the action of continued rains on the soft bed on which it rests, will undermine it, until other portions of the limestone will fall down ; and if this process take place on both sides of the mountain, the whole of the bed of lime stone will fall, except the part which rests flat upon the summit : and in this manner have been left the enormous caps of limestone, like immense castles, that compose the summits of the calcareous moun tains, near the lake of Annecy, and the Bauges. \u2014 \u25a0 Sometimes when the mountains are seen in profile, the caps which form an extended range in front,"], [468, "426 DESTRUCTION OF MOUNTAINS. present the appearance of a narrow ridge when seen in profile. The mountain called the Dent d' Alencon, near the Lake of Annecy, offers a remarkable instance of this. See Plate 2. fig. 6. The mass of limestone on its summit, \u2014 which 1 found by trigonometrical measurement to rise 3840 feet above the lake, and to be nearly five hundred feet in thickness, \u2014 was undoubtedly once a continuous bed, covering the mountain like a mantle, as represented by the dotted lines : in the course of ages, the side a a has fallen down, and the steep escarpment on the other side at b, is at present undermining, by the action of rain on the soft bed c c, and preparing for a further disintegration. The soft bed c c, which forms the talus or slope, being partly covered with vegetation on the side b c, is in some parts protected from rapid disintegration. On the oppo- site side of the valley, I found that the thick bed, which formed the talus or slope under the limestone, was lias clay. 1 was notable to ascend the Dent d' Alencon, and therefore did not ascertain whether the bed c was soft sandstone or lias. In numerous instances, the upper beds of limestone in the moun- tains of Savoy may be observed overlapping and overhanging, as at a a, Plate 3. fig. I, and are thus prepared to fall, whenever the rain and frost has widened the longitudinal natural fissures in the limestone. The present state of Mont Grenier, south of Chambery, and the vast ruins in the plain below, offer a striking illustration of the causes which are in operation, to disintegrate the vast calcareous mountains of savoy. \u2014 The following"], [469, "FALL OF MONT GRENIER. 427 description is copied from the lst volume of my Travels. \"A part of Mont Grenier fell down in the year 1248, and entirely buried five parishes, and the town and church of St. Andre. The ruins spread over an extent of about nine square miles, and are called les Alymes de My ans. After a lapse of so many centuries, they still present a singular scene of desolation. The catastrophe must have been most awful when seen from the vicinity ; for Mont Grenier is almost isolated, advancing into a broad plain, which extends to the valley of the Isere. It is several miles in length, and is con nected with the mountains ofthe Grand Chartreux, but it is very narrow. Its longitudinal direction is from east to west : near the middle it makes a bend towards the north, forming a kind of bay or conca vity on the southern side.\" \" Mont Grenier rises very abruptly upwards of 4000 feet above the plain. It is capped with an immense mass of limestone strata, not less than 600 feet in thickness, which presents on every side the appearance of a wall. The strata dip gently to the side which fell into the plain. This mass of lime- stone rests on a foundation of softer strata, pro- bably molasse ; under which are distinctly seen thin strata, alternating with soft strata. The an- nexed cut represents the east wing of the mountain and a small part ofthe Alymes de Myans. There can be little doubt that the catastrophe was caused by the gradual erosion of the soft strata, which undermined the mass of limestone above, and pro jected it into the plain. It is also probable, that the part which fell, had for some time been nearly de-"], [470, ""], [471, "429 FALL OF MONT GRENIER. tached from the mountain by a shrinking of the southern side ; as there is at present a rent at this end, upwards of 2000 feet deep, which seems to have cut off a large section from the eastern end, that now ' Hangs in doubtful ruins round its base,' as if prepared to renew the catastrophe of 1248. The Alymes de Myans are hills, or rather monti cules of a conical shape, varying in height from twenty to thirty feet ; they cover about nine square miles : the monticules are composed of fragments of calcareous strata, some of which are of immense size. They consist of yellowish oolitic limestone, strongly resembling the lower oolites in Glouces tershire ; a gray limestone, harder and more crystal line than lias, which however it may probably be ; a thin slaty arinaceous limestone, much resembling Stonesfield slate. Fragments of schistose chert, were interstratified with some of the limestone.\" \" The largest masses have evidently fallen from the upper bed of limestone by which Mont Grenier is capped. The velocity they would acquire by falling from so great a height, making due allow ance for the resistance of the atmosphere, could not be less than 300 feet per second ; and the pro jectile force they gained by striking against the base of the mountain, or against each other, has spread them far into the plain. In the course of years, the rains or currents of water from dissolving snows, have furrowed channels between the larger masses of stone, and washing away part of the loose earth, have left the immense number of de tached conical hills which are seen at present."], [472, "430 FALL OF MOUNTAINS So deep and vast was the mass of ruins that co vered the town of St. Andre and the other parishes, that nothing belong-ing: to them has been discovered, except a small bronze statue.\" (Page 201, vol. i.) A part ofa mountain near Servos on the road to Chamouny fell down in the year 1751. The fall continued for many days, and the air was darkened with immense volumes of black dust, which ex tended for twenty miles, and is still remembered by some of the oldest inhabitants of Chamouny. A continued succession of reports, like those of cannon, announced the successive falling of rocks, day and night. The mountain did not, like that of Mont Grenier, fall at once ; for it is composed of a succession of beds of limestone resting on sandstone, and extremely fragile schist, which are even now yielding to the constant action of rain. A deep excavation under a precipice of limestone near the summit, appeared in 1821 to threaten a renewal ofthe catastrophe of 1751 .. In the Swiss Alps, the great eboulements f which * In anEssay sur les CaractiresZoologiques, byM. Brong niart, published in 1822, he has given a section of this moun. tain ; and from the fossils in the upper bed, and the green sand intermixed, he has with much probability classed it with the chalk formation. The lower beds of the mountain, containing ammonites, he still classes with transition rocks; but I am per suaded that these lower beds are not more ancient than the En glish lias, or the blue beds of the magnesian limestone : and in this mountain, Montagne de Fis, we have all the upper secon dary strata of this part of Savoy in one group. f The fall of parts of mountains is so common an occurrence in the Alps, that it is expressively called an eboulements from the verb ebouler.

This will be better understood by referring to Plate 2. fig. 2. If a bed of conglome rate, b, as is frequently the case in the Swiss Alps, forms the outer side of a mountain, uncovered by any harder stratum, the action of rains upon its base, tends to destroy and undermine it, and the whole bed, perhaps several hundred feet in thick ness, is suddenly precipitated into the valley. In 1806, a part ofthe mountain of Rosberg, between the lakes of Zug and Laworts, fell down, from the cause here mentioned, and buried a considerable part of the valley, and several of the inhabitants. Where the soil is favourable to vegetation, the debris or ruins from the fall of mountains, become covered with vineyards and chesnut-trees; of which we have an example in the soil that covers the former town of Pleurs, near Chavennes, and all its noble palaces, belonging to opulent citizens of Mi lan. On the 26th of August, 1618, \"an inhabitant entered the town and said that he saw the moun tains cleaving : he was laughed at for his pains ; but in the evening the mountain fell and buried the town and all its inhabitants. The number destroyed is stated to be 2430, of whom not one escaped, except the person who warned them of their danger.\" Where the soil is unfavourable to vegetation, the ruins \"remain exposed to the action of rains, and of torrents from the sudden melting of snow, which furrow channels through them, and leave detached monticules, as in the Abymes de My ans; but it is"], [474, "432 MOUNTAIN TORRENTS. evident, that by these causes they could not be transported to distant countries, except in the com minuted form of sand or mud. There are, however, other causes in present ac tivity, which tear down large masses of rock, and carry them many miles from their native sites. The mountain valleys in the higher Alps, on the confines of eternal snow, sometimes become closed by the extension of a lateral glacier across them, which dams in the water from the melting of Al pine snow, and forms a mountain lake, elevated many thousand feet above the lower habitable val leys. During very hot summers, the same cause which increases the waters in the lake, by a more rapid melting of the Alpine snows, diminishes the strength and thickness of the barrier of ice; it is rent asunder, and the whole water of the lake is suddenly precipitated into the lower valleys with tremendous violence, tearing down and bearing along with it all opposing obstacles : the water is seen approaching like a moving wall. In this man ner was the village of Martigny in the Valais nearly destroyed in 1818. A similar inundation, in the valley of the Upper Doron in the Tarentaise, took place in the following year. I had an opportunity of observing its effects, which appeared to equal in intensity, but not in extent, those of diluvial action. Numerous blocks of rock of vast size, were brought down by the torrent, and scattered over a small plain at the mouth of the lateral valley, along which they had descended. These blocks were chiefly quartz rock, intermixed with a few blocks of mica and talc slate."], [475, "433 MOUNTAIN TORRENTS. This group of rocky masses, brought down by a mountain inundation in our own times, renders it probable, that the detached blocks and groups of rocky fragments, spread over many parts of the valley of Geneva, and the sides of the adjacent mountains, may have been brought there by similar causes. The groups often consist of one kind of rock with little intermixture ; in other parts, frag- ments of different rocks are intermixed in the same group. They all have been transported from the central range of the Alps, at a distance of from fifty to one hundred miles or more, from the places where they are now lying. The circumstance which most strongly arrests our notice, is the vast size of these blocks, and the height at which they are found. On the Great Saleve near Geneva, there is one block of granite seven feet in length, at the height of 2500 feet above the valley : some blocks on the south side of the valley, are at the height of 3000 feet above it. In a wood between Copey and Ny- on, there is one block of hornstone seventy feet in length. These blocks lie upon the surface of the ground, and are never found in the subjacent strata. But the most remarkable fact, is that of their occur- rence on the northern side ofthe Jura; they must therefore have been carried over that lofty range. The action of mountain inundations, howevergreat, seems inadequate to produce such effects; \u2014 but is it not possible, that the granite blocks were originally deposited upon a more level soil, and have been raised up with the calcareous mountains, at a sub sequent period ? 2 F"], [476, "434 INCROACHMENTS OF THE SEA. If the mountains and valleys were already raised and excavated, when these blocks were transported, they could only have been carried over the Jura by a mighty deluge, which had covered the summits ofthe Alps, and submerged all the present conti nents under its waves. Nor are there wanting proofs of such extensive inundations, in every country of the old world, that has yet been examined. To return to the causes which are in the present time wearing down the surface of islands and con tinents. \u2014 The action of the sea upon the cliffs in England, proves in a striking manner the changes which this important agent can effect in the space of a few centuries, and sometimes in a few years. In Devonshire and Dorsetshire, on the coasts of Sussex, Kent and Suffolk, the sea has made great incroachments on the land since the time of the Norman Conquest ; as may be proved both by an cient records, and by what is now taking place, the cliffs being undermined by high tides, large portions of land are yearly falling into the sea. It may however be doubted, whether the surface of dry land is not gradually increasing on the whole globe. The depositions from the sea and from rivers are filling up bays, estuaries and lakes : all broad flat valleys, and almost all low and fertile plains, were once covered with water. On the eastern part of our own island, though the land is wearing away in some parts, it is increasing more rapidly in others. The flat parts of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, and Holderness in Yorkshire, have been gained from the sea, or from rivers, by depo sitions of sand and mud at no very remote period ;"], [477, "435 LAND FORMED BY RIVERS. and the process is going on daily. In many parts, the sea during high tides is above the present level of the land, and is kept out by embankments. In Yorkshire, the proprietors contrive to raise the surface ofthe ground, by what is called warping. At the \"highest spring tides, they open sluices in the embankments, and cover the land with the turbid sea-water, which remains until it has depo sited its contents, and is let out at low water. The quantity of earthy matter held in suspension by rivers after heavy rains is prodigiously great. Ac cording to Major Rennell, a glass of water taken from the Ganges at the height of its inundations, yields one-fourth sediment. Mr. Barrow says, in his account of China, that the quantity of mud brought down by the Yellow River, was found by calcula tion, founded on experiment, to exceed two million solid feet per hour; and that some miles distant from the sea the river was three quarters of a mile broad, and was running at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour. A great part of the enormous mass of mud, which is perpetually broughtdown by theYel lowRiver, is borne by strong currents from theYellow Sea into the Gulph of Petchelee, where the stillness of the water allows it to subside. Into the same gulph, the river of Peking discharges itself; and Mr. Barrow observes, that a great part of the land adjoining this gulph, has apparently been formed by the sand and mud brought into it; for the tide flows inland one hundred and ten miles, and often inundates the whole country, the general level of which, is not more than two feet above the level of the river ; indeed, the deepest part of the great 2 f 2"], [478, "436 LAND FORMED BY RIVERS. gulph of Petchelee, does not exceed twelve fathoms, and the prodigious number of sandy islands just appearing above the surface, are said to have been formed within the records of history. (Barrow's China, p. 492.) \u2014 From the above account, there is every probability, that this wide gulph will soon be filled up by alluvial and marine depositions. The Gulph of Mexico, according to Humboldt, is gra dually filling by the sand brought into it from the Caribbean Sea on the south side, and from the vast rivers, the Rio del Norte and the Mississippi. The increase of land at the mouth of the Nile, and of many European rivers, is well known. Adria, which was once a port of the Adriatic Sea, (to which it gave its name,) is now six leagues in-land. ln lakes, the diminution of the surface, by the gradual in crease of land at the mouths of the rivers which flow into them, is still more remarkable. The mud and debris brought into the lake of Geneva by the Rhone, and deposited near its entrance, has made the land advance two miles in the space of 1700 years, \u2014 the Roman harbour Portus Valesi\u00e6 being now that distance from the lake. All the lakes in Savoy and Switzerland, and in our own island, are gradually diminishing by similar causes. To mul tiply instances of this kind, would be incompatible with the limits of the present volume ; every atten tive observer must have noticed them in the course of his travels. All the most fertile parts ofthe globe were formed by alluvial depositions : alluvial agency appears to have been the means employed in the \u0153conomy of nature, to prepare the world for the residence of"], [479, "THE FORMATION OF SOILS. 437 social and civilized man : the most ancient cities of which we have any authentic record, Babylon, Nineveh, and Thebes, were founded in the midst of alluvial soils, deposited by the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Nile : indeed it does not appear un reasonable to believe, that the formation of soils for the support of vegetables and animals, was the final cause for which the world was created, and to which all terrestrial changes ultimately refer. It has been justly observed by Dr. Paley and others, that in the peculiar conformation of the teeth in graminivorous animals, and in the produc tion of grasses which serve them for food, we may trace evident marks of relation, and of a designing intelligent cause. With equal reason must we admit, that the destruction of mountains and the formation of soils for the support of the vegetable tribes are provided for by the same cause, and are part of a regular series of operations in the \u0153conomy of nature. Hence also we may infer, that those grand revolutions of the globe, by which new mountains or continents are elevated from the deep, are part of the same series, extending through ages of inde finite duration, and connecting in one chain, all the successive ph\u00e6nomena ofthe material universe. By a wise provision ofthe Author of nature it is ordained, that those rocks which decompose rapidly, are those which form the most fertile soils; for the quality of soils depends on the nature of the rocks from which they were formed. Granitic and sili ceous rocks form barren and sandy soils ; argilla ceous rocks form stiff clay ; and calcareous rocks, when mixt with clays, form marie ; but when not"], [480, "438 THE FORMATION OF SOILS. covered by other strata, they support a short, but nutritious vegetation. For the formation of pro ductive soils, an intermixture of the three earths, clay, sand, and lime, is absolutely necessary. The oxide of iron appears also to be a requisite ingre dient. The proportion necessary for the formation of good soil, depends much on the nature of the climate, but more on the quality of the sub-soil, and its power of retaining or absorbing moisture. This alone may make a soil barren, which upon a different sub-soil would be exceedingly productive. When this is the case, drainage or irrigation offers the only means of permanent improvement. Different vegetables also require different ad mixtures of earth. They require it, first, because it is necessary to their growth, that the soil should be sufficiently stiff and deep to keep them firm in their place ; and also that it should not be too stiff to permit the expansion and growth oftheir roots : and, lastly, that it should supply them with a con stant quantity of water, neither too abundant nor deficient. Hence we may learn why different de grees of tenacity, depth and power of retaining or absorbing moisture, are required in soils for differ ent kinds of plants. Thus, in uncultivated coun tries, we find that certain vegetables affect parti cular situations in which they flourish spontaneously and exclusively ; and it is only by imitating nature, and profiting by the instruction she affords, that we can hope to obtain advantageous results, or ac quire certain fixt principles to guide us in our at tempts, to bring barren lands into a state of profita ble cultivation. When rocks contain in their com-"], [481, "439 THE FORMATION OF SOILS. position a due proportion of silex, clay, and lime, they furnish soils whose fertility may be said to be permanent. The most fertile districts in England were made so by nature ; their original fertility was independent of human operation. Some small portion of the earths and alkalies is found by chemical analysis in plants : but it would be contrary to fact and analogy to suppose, that the earths in a concrete state, form any part of the food of plants : the earths and alkalies which they contain, are in all probability formed by the process of vegetation from more simple elements; for it is now ascertained, that the earths and alkalies are compound substances. The principal elements found in plants are hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen ; and by experi ments of Gay Lussac and Thenard *, it appears that the hydrogen and oxygen in starch, gum, ve getable oils, and sugar, exist in precisely the same proportions that form water. Carbon, the other principal elementary substance found in plants, exists both in water and in the atmosphere. Water and the atmosphere contain in themselves, or in solution, all the elements necessary for the support and growth of vegetables. But most soils are either too wet or too dry, too loose or too adhesive, to admit plants to extract these elements, in the proportions necessary for their growth. Manures supply this deficiency by furnishing in great abun dance the hydrogen, carbon, or azote, which they may require. In proportion as soils possess a due degree of tenacity, and power of retaining or ab- * Recherches Physi.o-Chimiques."], [482, "440 THE FORMATION OF SOILS. sorbing heat aud moisture, the necessity for a supply of manure is diminished ; and in some in stances the earths are so fortunately combined, as to render all supply of artificial manure unneces sary. He who possesses on his estate the three earths, \u2014 clay, sand, and lime, \u2014 of a good quality, with facilities for drainage or irrigation, has all the materials for permanent improvement ; the grand desiderata in agriculture being to render wet lands dry, to supply dry lands with sufficient moisture, to make adhesive soils loose, and loose soils sufficiently adhesive. The intermixture of soils, where one kind of earth is either redundant or deficient, is practised in some countries with great advantage. Part of Lancashire is situated on the red sand rock de scribed in the sixth chapter. This rock, being principally composed of siliceous earth and the oxide of iron, forms of itself very unproduc tive land : but fortunately, in many situations it contains detached beds of calcareous marie near the surface. By an intermixture of this marie with the soil, it is converted into fertile land, and the necessity for manure is superseded. The effect of a good marie applied liberally to this land, lasts for more than twenty years. In some lands, a mixture of light marie which con tains scarcely a trace of calcareous earth, is found of great service. The good effect of this appears to depend on its giving to the sandy soil a sufficient degree of tenacity. The sterile and gravelly soils in Wiltshire, have been recently rendered pro ductive, by mixing them with chalk ; the most liberal application of manure having been found"], [483, "441 THE FORMATION OF SOILS. ineffective, or injurious. In stiff clay soils, where lime is at a great distance, the land might fre quently be improved by an intermixture with sili ceous sand. A proper knowledge of the quality of the sub-soil, and the position ofthe sub-strata, is ne cessary to ascertain the capability of improvement which land may possess. It may frequently happen, that a valuable stratum of marie or stone, which lies at a great depth in one situation, may rise near the surface in an adjoining part of the estate, and might be procured with little expense. Lime is the only earth which has been generally used to intermix with soils, and has been con sidered as a manure ; but its operation as such is very imperfectly understood. Burnt lime, when caustic, destroys undecomposed vegetable matter, and reduces it to mould, \u2014 so far its use is intelligi ble. It combines also with vegetable or mineral acids in the soil, which might be injurious to vege tation, \u2014 here its operation is likewise intelligible : but if we assert that when burnt lime has absorbed carbonic acid and become mild, it gives out its car bon again to the roots of plants, we assume a fact, which we have neither experiments nor analogies to support. The utility of lime in decomposing vegetable matter and neutralizing acids is obvious : but its other uses are not so evident; except we ad mit that it acts mechanically on the soil, and renders the clay or sand with which it is intermixt, better suited to the proper expansion of the roots, and more disposed to modify the power of retaining or absorbing the requisite degree of heat and moisture, which particular vegetables may demand."], [484, "442 THE FORMATION OF SOILS. Where earths are properly intermixt, instances are known of land producing a succession of good crops for many years, without fallowing or manure. On the summit of Breedon Hill, in Leicestershire, I have seen a luxuriant crop of barley growing on land that had borne a succession of twenty pre ceding crops without manuring. This is more de serving notice, being in an exposed and elevated situation, and upon the very hill of magnesian lime, which has been so frequently referred to by chemi cal writers, as peculiarly unfavourable to vegetation . The limestone of this hill contains above 20 per cent of magnesia*. The temperature requisite for the growth of plants is influenced by the power of different soils to absorb and retain heat from the solar rays, which depends much on their moisture and tenacity. \"It is a well known fact, that the vegetation of peren nial grasses in the spring, is at least a fortnight sooner on limestone and sandy soils, if not ex tremely barren, than on clayey or even in deep rich soils : it is equally true, but perhaps not so well known, that the difference is more than re versed in the autumn.\" \u2014 (Observations on Mildew, by J. Egremont, Esq.) \u2014 This effect Mr. E. ascribes with much probability to the rich or clayey soils absorbing heat slowly, and parting with it again more reluctantly than the calcareous soils, owing * The magnesian lime acts more powerfully in destroying undecomposed vegetable matter than common lime, and its effects on land are more durable : hence it is in reality of greater value in agriculture, as a much smaller quantity will answer the same purpose."], [485, "443 CALCAREOUS TUFA. to the greater quantity of moisture in the clay, which is an imperfect conductor of heat. Calcareous soils might frequently be much im proved by a mixture of clay, sand, or gravel, which in many situations is practicable with little expense, and would well reward the labour of the experi mental agriculturist. Calcareous Tufa. \u2014 Beside the new land formed by alluvial depositions, beds of calcareous tufa are sometimes formed in valleys, and at the bottom of lakes, by a process which bears some analogy to chemical formations. Springs containing car bonic acid, that issue from limestone strata, con tain particles of carbonate of lime chemically dis solved in the water ; but on exposure to air and light, the carbonic acid, which had but a slight affinity for the particles of limestone, separates, and the particles of lime are precipitated and form calcareous incrustations : these in a course of years form thick beds, and are sometimes suffi ciently hard to be used for building-stone. The Rock Mill, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, is built of this stone. In almost all limestone coun tries, there are instances of calcareous incrusta tions formed in springs, which have received the name of petrifying wells. In the first edition of this work, I ventured to predict that were ancient lakes laid dry, we should have instances of freshwater formations ; and this prediction has been verified. See an interesting paper on the recent freshwater limestone in For farshire, by Charles Lyell, Esq. (Geological Trans actions 1826,) of which I shall give a brief notice,"], [486, "444 STRATA FORMED IN after inserting what I had stated respecting the lakes of America. On the continent of America, nature acts upon a magnificent scale. Were her operations attended to, they might illustrate many interesting facts in geology. The lakes of North America are seas of fresh water more than fifteen hundred iniles in circuit : these are placed at a considerable elevation above the Atlantic, and at different levels. They unite by small streights or rivers, which have a rapid de scent. On some of them are prodigious waterfalls, which are constantly enlarging and shortening the passage from one to the other, and will ultimately effect the drainage of the upper lakes. The falls of Niagara are well known. The water is divided by a small island, which separates the river into two cataracts, one of which is six hundred and the other three hundred and fifty yards wide, and from one hundred and forty to one hundred and sixty feet in depth. It is estimated, that six hundred and seventy thousand tons of water are dashed every minute with inconceivable force against the bottom, undermining and wearing down the adjacent rocks. Since the banks of the cataract were inhabited by Europeans, they have observed that it is progressively shortening the distance from lake Erie to lake Ontario. When it has worn down the intervening calcareous rocks and effected a junction, the upper lake will become dry land, and form an extensive plain, surrounded by rising ground, and watered by a river or smaller lake, which will occupy the lowest part. In this plain"], [487, "445 FRESHWATER LAKES. future geologists may trace successive strata of freshwater formation, covering the subjacent cry stalline limestone. The gradual deposition of mi nute earthy particles, or the more rapid subsidence of mud from sudden inundations, will form dif ferent distinct beds, in which will be found re mains of freshwater fish, of vegetables, and of quadrupeds. Large animals are frequently borne along by the rapidity of the current, and precipi tated down the cataracts ; their broken bones mixt with calcareous sediment, may form rocks of cal careous tufa, where the waters first subside after their descent. The small lake described by Mr. Lyell, is about nine miles west of Forfar. It once extended over two hundred acres, but is now reduced to a peat moss, or swampy hollow in diluvium. The bed of the lake has been in a great part excavated for marie, it contains different strata, of variable thick ness. The upper covering is peat, one or two feet thick, under which is shell or rock marie, varying from one to sixteen feet. Quicksand two feet, and lower shell marie of a good quality, from one to two feet thick, resting on a bed of fine sand, of variable thickness. The rock marie consists wholly of carbonate of lime, it is hard and compact, and in some parts crystalline. The lower shell marie rarely contains any distinguishable quantity of shelly matter. In the rock marie are found shells of Helices, the Turbo fontinalis, and the Patella lacustris. There are remains of land quadrupeds in the shell marie, but not in the rock marie. The rock"], [488, "446 PEAT marie, (it appears from Mr. Lyell's description,) nearly resembles the upper freshwater limestone in the Paris basin, and like it, is traversed by tubular cavities. Some part of the rock marie is however stated to be a tufaceous limestone. This recent formation of freshwater limestone, is in so many respects analogous to the most recent formation of freshwater strata of the ancient world, that all the particular circumstances described by Mr. Lyell, deserve the careful attention of the geologist. Peat is a substance which has been classed with alluvial soils, though it is obviously a vegetable production. Peat formerly covered extensive tracts in England, but is disappearing before the genius of agricultural improvement, which has no where produced more important effects, than in the con version of the black and barren peat moors of the northern counties, into valuable land covered with luxuriant herbage, and depastured by numerous flocks. The following description of the peat moors in Scotland, by Mr. Jameson, is an accurate pic ture of the remaining peat moors in the mountain ous parts of Yorkshire, and the adjoining coun ties. \" In describing the general appearance of a peat moor, we may conceive an almost entire flat of se veral miles extent, of a brown colour, here and there marked with tufts of heather, which have taken root, owing to the more complete decompo sition of the surface peat ; no tree or shrub is to be seen ; not a spot of grass to relieve the eye, in wandering over this dreary scene. A nearer exa mination discovers a wet spongy surface, passable"], [489, "447 PEAT only in the driest seasons, or when all nature is locked in frost. The surface is frequently covered with a slimy black-coloured substance, which is the peat earth so mixt with water, as to render the moss only passable by leaping from one tuft of heather to another. Sometimes, however, the surface of peat mosses has a different aspect, owing to the greater abundance of heath and other vegetables, as the sch\u0153ni, scirpi, eriophora, &c. : but this is principally the case with some kinds of what are called muirlands, which contain but little peat, being nearly composed of the interwoven roots of living vegetables. Quick moss (as it is called) is a substance of a more or less brown colour, forms a kneadable compound, and when good, cuts freely and clean with the spade ; but when it resists the spade by a degree of elasticity, it is found to be less compact when dried, and is of an inferior quality. The best kinds burn with a clear bright flame, leaving light-coloured ashes ; but the more indifferent kinds in burning often emit a disagree able smell, and leave a heavy red-coloured kind of ashes. In digging the peat, we observe that when first taken from the pit it almost immediately changes its colour, which becomes more or less a deep brown or black, and the peat matter becomes much altered, being incapable of forming a knead able paste with water. When dry and reduced to powder, as it is often by the action of the weather, it forms a blackish-coloured powdery matter, capa ble of supporting vegetation, when calcareous earth is added. *' Peat is found in various situations, often in"], [490, "448 PEAT valleys or plains, where it forms very extensive deep beds, from three to forty feet deep, as those in Aberdeenshire : it also occurs upon the sides of mountains ; but even there, it is generally in a hori zontal situation. The tops of mountains, upwards of two thousand feet high, in the Highlands of Scotland, are covered with peat of an excellent kind. \" It is also found in situations nearly upon a level with the sea : thus, the great moss of Cree in Gal loway, lies close upon the sea, on a bed of clay, little higher than the flood marks at spring tides*.\" In the first volume of Dr. MacCulloch's valuable History of the Western Islands of Scotland, he has given a luminous description of the formation of peat, which completes the natural history of peat moss. Beside the Sphagnum palustre, he has enu merated nearly forty plants which concur to the generation of peat. \"The process by which these vegetables are con verted into peat, is most clearly seen in the Sphag num. As the lower extremity of the plant dies, the upper sends forth fresh roots like most of the mosses, the individual thus becoming in a manner immortal, and supplying a perpetual fund of de composing vegetable matter. A similar process, though less distinct, takes place in many of the rushes and grasses, the ancient roots dying together with the outer leaves, while an annual renovation of both, perpetuates the existence of the plant. The growth of peat, necessarily keeps pace with * Jameson's Mineralogy of the Shetland Islands."], [491, "FORMATION OF PEAT. 449 that of the vegetables from which it is formed ; hence the necessity of replacing the living turf on the bog where peat has been cut, \u2014 a condition now required in all leases, in which liberty to cut turf is included. On the conversion of vegetable matter into peat, Dr. MacCulloch observes: \" Where the living plant is still in contact with peat, the roots of the rushes, and ligneous vegetables, are found vacillating between life and death, in a spongy half-decomposed mass. Lower down, the pulverized carbonaceous matter is seen mixed with similar fibres, still resisting decomposition. These gra dually disappear, and at length a finely powdered substance alone is found, the process being com pleted by the total destruction of all the organized bodies.\" p. 130. The best peat is that of which the decomposition is most complete, and the specific gravity and compactness the greatest. The quality of peat, Dr. MacCulloch observes, is much affected by the wetness or dryness of the soil, and the ele vation or other causes, which influence the tempe rature or moisture of the atmosphere. For a description of the chemical changes pro duced in peat by water and fire, I must refer to the lst volume of Dr. MacCulIoch's work before quoted, p. 131. It is only in the first stages of de composition that peat is soluble, and communicates a dark colour to water. The rapid formation of peat in many situations, where it is found covering ground that was formerly pastured, admits of an easy explanation, since Dr. MacCulloch has so clearly described the mode, in which this substance is generated. 2g"], [492, "450 HUMAN BODIES PRESERVED IN PEAT. The property possessed by peat of preserving animal matter from putrefaction, is well deserving notice. It is probably owing to this, that some of the fleshy parts of the mastodon, have been so long preserved in peat bogs. In the Philosophical Transactions 1734, there is a letter from Dr. Balguy, giving an account of the preservation of two human bodies in peat for fifty-nine years. \" On January 14, 1675, a farmer and his maid-servant were crossing the peat moors above Hope, near Castleton in Derbyshire ; they were overtaken by a great fall of snow, and both perished : their bodies were not found till the 3d of May in the same year; and being then offen sive, the coroner ordered them to be buried on the spot in the peat. They lay undisturbed twenty eight years and nine months, when the curiosity of some countrymen induced them to open their graves. The bodies appeared quite fresh, the skin was fair and of its natural colour, and the flesh as soft as that of persons newly dead. They were afterwards frequently exposed as curiosities, until in the year 17 16, they were buried by order of the man's descendants. At that time, Dr. Bourne of Chesterfield, who examined the bodies, says the man was perfect, his beard was strong, the hair of his head was short, and his skin hard and of a tanned leather colour, like the liquor he was lying in. The body of the woman was more injured, having been more frequently exposed; the hair was like that of a living person. Mr. Wormald, the minister of Hope, was present when they were re moved: the man's legs, which had never before been"], [493, "451 INUNDATIONS OF SAND. uncovered, were quite fair when the stockings were drawn off, and the joints played freely without the least stiffness.\" In the beginning of the last century, the perfect body of a man in the ancient Saxon costume, was discovered in peat, at Hatfield Chase in Yorkshire : it soon perished on exposure to the air. Extensive tracts of cultivated ground are some times converted into sandy deserts, by the drifting of sea-sand inland. The process by which this is effected, is taking place, at present, in many si tuations. During very high winds, the sand is driven from the sea shore to a certain distance, leaving an elevated ridge at the further boundary of the drift. Succeeding winds blow the sand forward, and at the same time bring fresh sand from the shore to supply its place. In the sixth volume of the Transactions of the Irish Academy, an account is given of the encroachment of the sand, over some parts of Ireland. Trees, houses, and even villages, have been surrounded or covered with sand, during the last century. In the vicinity of sandy deserts, the sand is also encroaching on the habitable land. The loose sands of Libya are thus spreading over the valley that borders the Nile, and burying the monuments of art, and the vestiges of former cultivation. From a similar cause, the country immediately round Palmyra, that once supplied a crowded population with food, now scarcely affords a few withered plants, to the camel ofthe wandering Arab. A sandy inundation on the north coast of Corn wall was mentioned Chapter I. page 24. This sand, 2 g 2"], [494, "452 (ORAL ROCKS. which is composed of fragments of shells and coral, is in some parts cemented into sandstone by water infiltrating from the slate-rocks: it is similar in ap pearance to the recent sandstone of Guadaloupe, in which human skeletons have been found : the latter is a very common sandstone in the West Indies; it increases rapidly, and the land gained from the sea, which forms some of the plains of St. Domingo, is composed of it. A concreted calcareous sandstone extends on the southern, western, and north-west ern coast of Australasia, for three thousand miles. Some specimens which I examined with a lens, appear perfectly similar to the recent sandstone from Guadaloupe. Among the causes in present activity, which are changing the surface of the globe, the labours of madrepores must not be unnoticed. These minute polypi, raise up walls and reefs of coral-rock with astonishing rapidity in tropical climates, and encir cle the present islands with belts of coral, thus en larging their coasts. A coral reef of seven hundred miles in length, extends from the north-west of Australasia towards New Guinea. For a detailed account of coral rocks and reefs, I must refer the reader to the Observations of Dr. Forster, and the voyages of Captain Flinders and of Kotzebue. The French naturalists MM. Quoi and Gaimard have, however, recently shown, that madrepores which form coral-rocks, do not commence their operations at greater depths than twenty-five or thirty feet below the surface of the sea : they con struct their habitations on the summits of sub marine rocks, and increase their height, but do not"], [495, "FOSSIL ELEPHANT. 453 form them. The quantity of calcareous matter which these madrepores furnish, cannot (they say) be compared with the quantity of materials which testaceous animals have furnished, and still continue to furnish, to the crust of the globe. Organic remains in diluvial beds and caverns. \u2014 The fossil elephant, or mammoth, is the most remarkable of the ancient herbivorous quadrupeds, both from its vast size, and the amazing number of bones of this genus, which are found in the northern parts of Europe, and in America. It must have existed in herds of hundreds and thousands. Ac cording to Pallas, there is scarcely a river, from the Don, or the Tanais, to thc extremity of the pro montory Tchuskoinosa, in the banks of which, the bones of the mammoth are not abundant. There are two large islands near the mouth of the river Indigerska, which are said to be entirely composed ofthe bones ofthe mammoth, intermixed with ice and sand : the tusks are so perfect, that they are dug out for ivory. With the bones of the mam moth, are intermixed those of the elk, the rhino ceros, and other large quadrupeds. The body of a fossil elephant has been found entire, with the flesh preserved, buried in ice : it had a mane along its back, and was covered with coarse red wool, protected by hair of a coarser kind, indicating that it was an inhabitant of cool climates : indeed, the circumstance of the body being pre served in ice, is a further proof of this ; for had it been conveyed from distant regions, or had the temperature of northern latitudes been much higher at that period, than at present, the flesh must have"], [496, "454 THE GREAT MASTODON. been speedily decomposed, before it could have been enveloped in ice. The height of this animal was from fifteen to eighteen feet. Bones and teeth ofthe mammoth are not unfrequently found in England, in beds of diluvial gravel and clay, and in caverns : they are chiefly found in low situations, such as the Vale of the Thames, and the Vale of thex Severn. The mammoth bears a near resemblance to the Indian elephant, butCuvier regards it as a distinct species. The rhinoceros, of which there are three large species, and one smaller, appears to have lived with the fossil elephant : their bones are found together ; but it is in Siberia, that the bones of the rhinoceros are most numerous, and best preserved. In the year 1771, the entire body of one of these ani mals, was found in the frozen sands of that country. Bones and teeth of the hippopotamus are found both in England, France, Germany, and Italy : there are two species ; the largest resembles the African hippopotamus, the smaller is the size of the wild boar. Bones and teeth of a large animal, called the mastodon, are found both in Europe and America. The great mastodon had pointed grind ers ; it was a native of North America, and equalled in size the elephant, which in many particulars it resembled.

Bones of other species of the mastodon are found in Europe and South America; these are probably more ancient. Teeth of a gigan tic species of tapir, equal in size to the rhinoceros, have been found in France and Germany* : the bones of horses are also found in great abundance, with the bones of the above-mentioned animals. Bones and horns of the elk, the stag, and of various species of deer, and of oxen, some of which closely resemble existing species, are often intermixed with the bones of elephants and other ancient animals. With these animal remains, are also found the bones of carnivorous animals of the size of the lion, the tiger, and the hyena ; the bones of bears are numerous, particularly in caverns. The number of bones belonging both to the order of pachydermata, and of ruminant and car nivorous quadrupeds, is so great in various parts of Europe, as to leave no doubt that the animals were inhabitants of northern or temperate climates.

The mega lon ix was nearly similar in form, but smaller. Bones of the camel, and some other species of large mammiferous quadrupeds have been occa sionally found, but they are of rare occurrence. For a knowledge of nearly all the above species of fossil mammiferous quadrupeds, we are indebted to the researches of Cuvier. Their bones, he observes, \"are found in that mass of earth, sand and mud, that diluvium, which covers our large plains, fills our caverns, and chokes up the fissures in many of our rocks. They incontestibly formed the popula tion of the continents, at the epoch of the great ca tastrophe, which has destroyed their races, and has prepared the soil, on which the animals ofthe pre sent day subsist. Whatever resemblance certain of these species bear to those of existing species, the general mass of this population had a different character ; the greater part of the races which com posed it, have been utterly destroyed. Among all these mammiferous animals, the greater number of which have their congeners living at the present day, there has not been found a single bone or tooth of any species of ape or monkey. Nor is there any trace of man : all the human bones which have been found along with those of which we have been speaking, have occurred accidentally; and their number besides is exceedingly small, which assuredly would not have been the case, if men had been then settled in the countries which these ani mals inhabited.\" When Cuvier published the first edition of his Recherches sur les Ossemens fossiles, he too hastily concluded, that we were already ac-"], [499, "457 QUADRUPEDS IN DILUVIAL DEPOSITIONS. quainted with all the existing species of large land quadrupeds; and hence he inferred, that it was highly improbable, that any of the species of un known quadrupeds, whose bones are found in dilu vial soils, should be still living. Since that time, a large species of living tapir has been found in the East Indies ; and other discoveries of new quadru peds have been made : hence we cannot conclude with absolute certainty, that all the species of un known fossil quadrupeds are extinct, though it seems highly probable, that the greater number of the races have perished. The animals whose bones are found in peat bogs and marshes, \u2014 such as the elk in Ireland, and the great mastodon in Ken tucky, \u2014 may, I conceive, be referred with much probability, to a more recent epoch, than that in which the diluvial beds were deposited. Skeletons, both of the Irish elk and the great American mastodon, have been found erect in peat bogs and marshes, which proves that the surface of the ground has undergone little change since the animals perished; and the further circumstance, of the flesh and stomach of the mastodon being found near the surface, notprotected, like the bodies ofthe elephant and rhinoceros found in Siberia, by ice, seems to preclude the belief in the high anti quity of these animal remains ; and it is admitted by Cuvier, that they are in better preservation than any other fossil bones. The quadrupeds whose bones are buried in beds of clay, sand or gravel, or accumulated in caverns, undoubtedly lived in a very remote period, and under a different condition of our planet to the present one. The northern"], [500, "458 FOSSIL IVORY. parts of Europe seem now incapable of supporting the immense number of elephants, which have formerly spread over all the valleys bordering the Frozen Ocean. Were we to suppose that the tem perature of the earth was then higher than at pre sent, which the remains of palms and other tropical plants found in northern latitudes would render probable, this would not remove the difficulty ; for the fact, that entire bodies of elephants have been preserved in ice, and that their skins were covered with a thick coat of wool and hair, proves that these animals were constituted for living in cold climates, and that their remains have not been transported to any great distance, from the countries which they inhabited*. The remains of these large quadrupeds occur in different states of preservation. In the frozen re gions of the North, the ivory of the tusks is perfect. In beds of clay, the bones and teeth are frequently impregnated with mineral matter; but in gravel they are generally in a loose or friable state, or at least they soon become so after exposure to the air. In the Phil. Journal of Edinburgh, January 1828, an account is given of numerous bones of the mas todon, rhinoceros, and other animals, having been found on the surface of the ground, near Irrawady River, in Ava. These bones, though exposed to the atmosphere, are stated to be extremely hard, being * A friend has suggested, that the Siberian elephants were probably migratory, and passed the winter months in more tem perate latitudes.

The bones of carnivorous animals are most abundant in caverns : there are some circumstances which render their occurrence in such situations very difficult to explain in a satisfactory manner. It has been long known to naturalists and tra vellers, that there are numerous caverns in the cal careous mountains of Germany and Hungary, the floors of which are covered with clay, enveloping a prodigious quantity of bones and teeth of carni vorous animals. The bones in these caverns are nearly the same, over an extent of more than one hundred leagues. More than three fourths belong to species of bears that are now extinct*; two thirds of the remaining part belong to an un known species of hyena ; a smaller number belong to a species of lion or tiger, or of the wolf or dog ; a very few belong to small carnivorous animals, al lied to the fox and polecat. The bones are nearly in the same state in all these caverns : they are found scattered and detached, partly broken, but never rounded by attrition, and consequently not brought from a distance by water. They are ra ther lighter and more fragile than recent bones, but stiff preserve their true animal matter, contain ing much gelatine, and are not in the least petri fied. The bones are all enveloped in earth which * The most common species of bear in these caverns, the Ursus Spel\u00e6us, was the size of a horse. The fossil hyena was one third larger than any known living species."], [502, "460 CAVERNS IN GERMANY. is penetrated with animal matter ; except a few bones on the surface, of a different kind, which have been brought there at a later period, and are less decomposed. The most remarkable of these caverns are those of Gaylenreuth on the left bank ofthe river Wie sent, in Bavaria ; they vary in height from ten to forty feet, and are connected by narrow low pas sages. The animal earth intermingled with bones, is in many places more than ten feet deep ; and ac cording to the account of a German writer, M. Esper, would fill many hundred waggons. There is also a cavern, or series of caverns, at Adelsberg in Car nolia, much larger than any in Germany : the caves are of variable dimensions, and are stated to extend more than three leagues in a right line, at which distance there is a lake which prevents further access. The floors of these caverns are covered with indurated clay, enveloping the bones of bears, and other carnivorous animals, similar to those in the caverns of Germany and Hungary. In one part of this cavern, or series of caverns, the entire skeleton of a young bear was discovered, enveloped in clay or mud, between blocks of limestone which lay on one side of the cave. Adelsberg is situated on the great road from Trieste to Laybach, and has been much visited by travellers. The river Pinka is lost in this cavern, terminating in a sub terranean lake, from whence another river emerges on the northern side, which has received the name of Unz. There are incrustations of stalactites in these, as well as in all other calcareous caverns ; and in many parts, the bones and earthy matter"], [503, "461 CAVERNS IN ENGLAND. are covered by stalactites. Formerly, these bones formed an important article of commerce, being used in medicine, and sold under the name of the fossil unicorn. Single skeletons of large quadru peds have formerly been discovered in caverns in this country; but we had no authentic account of the bones of carnivorous animals having been found in any English caves, previously to the year 1821 ; when some labourers working in a quarry at Kirk dale near Kirby Moorside, in Yorkshire, discovered an opening covered over with rubbish and earth, about 100 feet above the neighbouring brook. This was the mouth of a low cavern, extending about 200 feet into the rock. The floor of the cavern was covered with broken bones and teeth of various animals, encased in a stratum of mud about a foot thick. Fortunately, this cavern was examined by Professor Buckland of Oxford, soon after its discovery ; who has published a very lumi nous account of its structure and contents, eluci dated by references to the most remarkable caverns in other countries which he has visited, containing bones of carnivorous animals. The bones in the Kirkdale Cave are broken and gnawed, and some of them preserve the marks of the teeth which have fractured them. Even the excrements of animals similar to those of the hyena, have been discovered with them. The bones in this cave differ much from those in the caves of Germany ; as a great number of them belong to herbivorous animals, and the carnivorous animals whose remains are most abundant, are hyenas. Among these remains,"], [504, "462 KIRKDALE CAVERN. Professor Buckland has ascertained bones of the following orders : \u2014 Carnivorous Quadrupeds.\u2014 The hyena, tiger, bear, wolf, fox and weasel.

Ruminant Animals. \u2014 The ox, and fragments and bones of three species of deer. Birds. \u2014 The raven, pigeon, lark, snipe, and a small species of duck. From the great number of bones of the hyena found in this cave, Professor Buckland infers that it had lone: been the habitation of these animals. It is their ascertained habit partly to devour the bones of their prey ; they also devour the dead bodies of their own species ; like wolves they are gregarious and hunt in packs. From the habits of the hyena, he explains the occurrence of the remains of large herbivorous quadrupeds like the elephant in so low a cave as that of Kirkdale; they have been dragged into it by these voracious animals. Several English caverns have since been explored. In some of them there are bones both of herbivorous and carnivo rous animals, similar to those in the Kirkdale Cave. These caves are described in Professor Buckland's valuable work entitled Reliqui\u00e6 Diluvian\u00e6. That the caverns in which the bones of carnivo rous animals are found in such prodigious quanti ties, were the retreats of some of these animals, cannot be doubted. Many circumstances described"], [505, "KIRKDALE CAVERN. 463 in the account of the Kirkdale Cave, can only be explained by admitting it. There are, however, other circumstances, particularly in the caves of Germany, which would imply, that part ofthe bones belong to animals that had fallen through fissures, which formerly opened into these caverns, or that the bones themselves had been carried by water through these fissures. In the cave at Galenreuth, there are rounded fragments of limestone, inter mixed with the bones, and the entrance of some of the caverns is much too small to have admitted the animals whose bones are found in them. I think it is also probable, that a violent convulsion of na ture, as a rising deluge and the fierce war of ele ments without, might have driven, under the strong impulse of alarm, numerous animals of different species into the same caverns, where they devoured each other, and their bones have been intermixed with those of the former inhabitants. It is also highly probable, that the entrances of many of the caverns, and the caverns themselves, have been formerly more lofty than at present, but have been gradually lowered by the subsidence of the upper strata. Indeed it is admitted, that the caverns and grottoes in the neighbourhood of Adelsberg, have occasioned numerous depressions of the surface. Such an effect must generally take place, in a greater or less degree, with the strata over caverns. Most calcareous caverns appear to have been ori ginally formed by subterranean streams of water, washing out the irregular beds of clay between the limestone strata ; and when the cavern is formed, the upper strata must gradually or suddenly descend."], [506, "464 FISSURES FILLED WITH BONES. If the same process of excavation by subterranean water take place slowly, the subsidence may be so gradual, as scarcely to be perceived in the lapse of centuries. I am acquainted with an instance of the gradual subsidence ofa hill of oolite in Lincolnshire within the memory of man, supported by undoubt ed testimony. There is also a fact respecting the calcareous mountains near Ingleton and Settle in Yorkshire, illustrative of the manner in which bones may be introduced into caverns; but still more so, ofthe manner in which the fissures of cal careous rocks, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, have been filled with bones of herbivorous animals. The mountain or transition limestone of Craven in Yorkshire, forms in many parts, a nearly flat elevated surface of table land, covered with vegeta tion, but intersected by numerous fissures or chasms of vast length and depth, varying from a few inches to a foot or more in width. Many of these fissures widen as they descend ; and at the bottom, streams of water may be frequently heard running. During snow, it is not uncommon for sheep to be lost in these chasms, and the whole surface is extremely dangerous to traverse in the dark. Limestone plains, intersected by such fissures, may be re garded as natural traps for herbivorous animals, into which they may fall in whole droves, when chased by beasts of prey. Their bones may either stick fast in the fissures, and be afterwards inclosed in calcareous stalactites, or they mav be carried by subterranean currents into caverns, which have no communication with the surface. Such was the cavern at the Bull's Eye mine, near Worksworth in"], [507, "INTERMIXTURE OF FOSSIL BONES. 465 Derbyshire, which was opened by mining opera tions in the year 1663, and contained the entire skeleton of an elephant. The bones of existing species of animals in peat, or in alluvial soil, may occasionally be found inter mixed with fossils from ancient strata ; for when the rocks which contain the organic remains of a former world, are exposed to the disintegrating effects of atmospheric action, the fossils being ge nerally harder than the stone in which they are imbedded, fall out, and may be carried down by casual inundations and mixed with recent alluvial deposits. It may also happen that recent bones have been transported by the same cause, and in termixed with ancient diluvial deposits : such inter mixtures are not of frequent occurrence, but they should be most carefully noticed by the geologist, or they may be the source of very erroneous in ductions. Baron Cuvier maintains that the anoplotherium, and paleotherium, found in the gypsum strata near Paris, belong to a more ancient creation than the fossil elephant and mastodon. Many facts might be cited (did the limits of the present volume permit), which oppose the opinion of this distin guished naturalist. The remains of elephants found in beds analogous to the London clay, and of the mastodon and beaver found under beds of sand stone and limestone at Alpnach, must surely be as ancient, as the quadrupedal remains in the Paris basin. 2 H"], [508, "466 CHAPTER XIX. GEOLOGICAL THEORIES.\u2014 THE FORMATION OF VALLIES.\u2014 DELUGES, AND DENUDATIONS. THERE are few subjects on which the opinions of geologists have been more divided, than the formation of vallies. The principal theories that have been advanced, ascribe their formation to one or other of the following causes. lst, To the original inequalities of the earth's surface. 2d, To excavation by rivers that flow through them. 3d, To the elevation or subsidence of part of the earth's surface. 4th, To excavations caused by the sudden retreat of the sea from our present continents. 5th, To excavations by inundations or deluges, that have suddenly swept over the surface of different parts of the globe. I shall briefly notice the leading facts that favour or oppose each of these theories. \u2014 The phenomena presented by different vallies, are frequently various and complicated, and indicate, that several causes have cooperated in their excavation, or in moulding them into their present form. The disappearance of large portions of strata, from districts which they have once evidently covered, is also a phenomenon of frequent occurrence ; and its explanation must"], [509, "467 THEORY OF WERNER. be sought, from some of the same causes, that have excavated vallies. The first of the above theories is that of Werner : he supposed that all the matter of which primary, transition, and secondary rocks are formed, was originally held in solution by water, and that the water, so saturated with mineral matter, covered the whole globe. The primary rocks of granite were formed by chemical precipitation, and their peaked summits and declivities were the result of their original deposition. On the steep sides of these primary mountains were subsequently depo sited the different schistose rocks, and all the se condary strata. During the time that these rocks were depositing, the water, though nearly saturated with mineral matter, was capable of supporting animal life, and the shells and remains of zoophytes and fish, were enveloped in the strata at the period of their deposition. According to this theory, when the water retired from the present continents, the mountains and vallies were already formed. The theory of Werner requires for its support the admission of conditions, which appear in the present state of our experience impossible, and it is at variance with existing phenomena. The ver tical position of beds of pudding-stone, sandstone, and the tertiary strata in the Alps, could not have been their original one; nor can the bendings and contortions of the strata, so common in Alpine countries, be explained by original deposition. A further account of part of Werner's theory is given, Chap. IX. page 217. The second theory, That all vallies have been 2 h 2"], [510, "468 THEORY OF HUTTON. excavated by the rivers that flow through them, was maintained by Dr. Hutton and Professor Play fair : it formed a part of their general theory of the earth ; the leading propositions of which are, that the surface of the present continents are wearing down by the action of the atmosphere and by torrents, and that the materials are carried by rivers into the sea, and there deposited. At a future period these materials will be melted or consolidated by subterranean heat under the pres sure of the ocean, and subsequently, by the expan sive force of central fire, the bed of the ocean will be elevated, and form new continents. According to this theory, our present continents have been also formed from the ruins ofa preceding world, and elevated by a similar cause. It is only with that part of the Huttonian system which relates to the excavation of valleys, that we have at present any concern. It is remarkable, that a theory which maintains that the continents were raised from the ocean by subterranean fire, should limit the forma tion of vallies to the action of the rivers that run through them ; for if the land were raised by an ex pansive power acting from beneath, it seems to follow as a necessary corollary, that the surface would be unequally elevated, and broken into in equalities by the same cause ; unless we suppose, that every part presented an equal degree of resist ance to the moving force. There must, therefore, have been original inequalities or vallies, which de termined the direction of the water-courses in the first instance, though the form of these vailies may have been subsequently modified, by the action"], [511, "469 ACTION OF RIVERS. of water. That all vallies have been excavated by the rivers that flow through them, is opposed by many decisive facts. Before their excavation, the water must have had less force than at present, as the fall would be gentle ; and the present effect of rivers in larg-e vallies is not to excavate them deeper, but to fill them with alluvial depositions. There are numerous deep valleys in the Alps, that are closed at one end by steep mountains or per pendicular walls of rock, and which were originally closed, and are now nearly closed, at the other end also. Such are the valley of Thones near Annecy, the valley of Chamouni, and, on a larger scale, the valley of Geneva. It is evident that the valley of Thones, and that of Geneva, have once been filled with water, and formed lakes : by an earthquake, or by the erosion of water, a fissure has been made, which has drained the greater part of these valleys; but it is obvious that the valleys could not have been formed by the original lakes, or by the rivers that flowed into them. If vallies were formed by the erosion of rivers, the lakes through which these rivers flow, must have long since been filled up by the materials brought into them. To say that the lakes were once deeper than at present, is giving up the theory; for lakes are only the deeper parts of vallies. Had the valley of Borrowdale in Cumberland been excavated by the water that flows from it, the lake of Keswick, at its entrance, must have received all the materials, and been long since choked up. Or had the valley of the Rhone, ten thousand feet deep and sixty miles in length, been excavated by the Rhone, the quantity of matter brought down"], [512, "470 ACTION OF TORRENTS. by this river, would not only have filled the lake of Geneva into which it empties itself, but the broad valley in which the lake lies, must also have been filled up, and raised to the height of the Jura. That the lake of Geneva, and all lakes into which large rivers flow, are gradually filling up, has been before stated ; but the valley of the Rhone is not, nor are other valleys, becoming deeper. The upper part of this valley has evidently been itself a lake, closed in, or nearly so, by the rocks at Martigny. The action of torrents in Alpine districts, may have been sufficient to widen fissures already made, or to scoop out glens in the softer beds on the sides of mountains ; but they appear inadequate to the original formation of large longitudinal vallies. Water-courses running on the edges of nearly ver tical beds, may scoop out a portion of a softer bed, placed between two hard rocks, and thus form small longitudinal vallies. I have observed several in stances of such vallies in the Alps, which may pro bably have been furrowed by mountain torrents in the course of ages. Some vallies, as Les Echelles, near Chambery, are closed at one end by a per pendicular wall of rock : through this rock a tunnel is made for the road ; but it is impossible to con ceive, that any action of water-courses could have formed such a valley. There is only a feeble stream that flows from it*. Malm Cove, at the head of the valley ofthe Aire, in Yorkshire, is a perpendicular wall of limestone 200 feet high : at its feet the river * For a particular account of the structure of this valley, see Travels in the Tarantaise, vol. i. page 169."], [513, "471 THEORY OF ELEVATION. rises ; but no conceivable action of the river could have originally formed this valley. Whatever extension we may reasonably grant to the action of rivers, it will not be found sufficient for the ex cavation of vallies, except in particular situations. The third theory, which attributes the formation of vallies to the elevation of mountain ranges, ap pears to assign a cause, that will explain, in a sim ple manner, the formation of many vallies ; but on examination, it wil! be found inadequate to explain the phenomena of other vallies, without the concur rence of diluvial action. If the crust of the globe were broken, and raised in parallel ridges, they might form mountain ranges, with vallies between them, like what are observed bordering the central range of the Alps ; the arched stratification of many of the calcareous moun tains, and the vertical position of the beds, favour this hypothesis. In some instances, where the beds of a mountain are raised from an horizontal, to a nearly vertical position, they would leave a chasm proportionate to the part that had been raised ; and this might form the bed of a lake. The steep escarpments which the calcareous mountains in Switzerland and Savoy present to the lakes which they border, in dicate that the beds of the lakes were formed in the hollows that had been left by the elevation of the mountains. The beds of the mountains on the opposite side, generally slope down to the lakes\": hence M. De Luc inferred, that it was these mountains that had sunk down, and left the chasm which forms the bed of the lake. Either of these"], [514, "472 TRANSVERSAL VALLIES. theories will explain the formation of deep lakes in mountainous countries, in a more satisfactory man ner, than that which attributes the deepening of their beds to the erosion of water. Nor is the elevation of parts of the earth's surface by a power acting from beneath, unsupported by undoubted facts. We have instances in our own island of the strata being broken, and raised five or six hundred feet. (See pages 153 and 195.) And so recently as the year 1822, the bed ofthe ocean, over an extent of one hundred miles, was perma nently raised up, and became dry land. (See page 104.) These facts may make us more ready to acknowledge the operation of a similar elevating power, having acted with greater intensity, and more extensively, in former ages. Transversal vallies, or those which cut through mountain ranges, nearly at right angles to the di rection of the ranges they intersect, may have been originally fissures or openings, made either at the period when the ranges were elevated, or subse quently, by the same causes that have rent and dis placed the secondary strata. These fissures may have been afterwards widened by diluvial agency. Geologists seem now generally agreed, that the action of rivers is not sufficient to explain all the phenomena of vallies, and still less to account for the fragments of rocks scattered over extensive plains, at an immense distance from Alpine dis tricts, where rocks similar to these fragments oc cur. Another phenomenon of more importance, is altogether inexplicable, by the action of rivers. Immense tracts of the secondary strata, several"], [515, "473 DENUDATIONS. hundred feet in depth, have, in some districts, been torn off, and the materials entirely removed, except detached patches, which here and there form iso lated caps on distant hills ; and incontestably prove, that they were once parts of one continuous stra tum or formation. Numerous instances of this might be cited in our own island. This local dis appearance of a stratum or formation, has properly been called Denudation. The theory advanced by Mr. Farey, to explain these denudations, was, that the surface had been broken and swept away by the near approach of a comet. But the most rational explanation that can be offered, is that which ascribes the effect to a mighty deluge, sweep ing over the surface of the globe, tearing off part of its crust, and transporting the fragments into distant regions, or into the ocean. The case is one which may be truly said to be dignus vindice nodus, and the geologist is compelled to call in the aid of Neptune; for none of the causes in present activity, (however we may imagine them to be in creased in power or magnitude,) will be found ade quate to produce the denudation of an extensive stratum, and the disappearance of the stony mate rials, of which it was composed. It now remains to notice the theories which provide for diluvial agency. The fourth theory, which attributes the forma tion of vallies to the sudden retreat of the sea from our present continents, is founded on the admitted fact, that the sea has once covered them; and whe ther we suppose that the bed of the ocean was deepened in one part by a sudden subsidence, which"], [516, "474 THEORY OF SIR JAMES HALL. drew off the water from another part; or that the continents emerged, by an expansive force acting beneath them, \u2014 the effect on the water would be nearly the same. This effect, in scooping out val leys, has been compared to what may be observed in miniature \" by the drainage of the retiring tides on muddy shores, especially in confined estuaries, where the fall is considerable and rapid,\" the water cutting out channels for its passage as it drains off. The fifth theory, which ascribes the formation of valleys, and extensive denudations of the strata, to deluges that have suddenly swept over different parts of the globe, has been maintained by Profes sor Pallas and Sir James Hall. The former con- jectured, that the inundations that have covered parts of the Asiatic continent with blocks of stone, beds of gravel, and marine remains, were occasion ed by the formation of volcanic islands in the In dian Ocean. Within the period of authentic history, extensive inundations have been occasioned by volcanoes and earthquakes, which afford probabi lity to the opinion of Pallas. In the year 1650, a new volcanic island rose from the sea in the Gre cian Archipelago ; and according to the account of Kircher, a cotemporary writer, it occasioned the sea to rise forty-five feet in height, at the distance of eighty miles, and destroyed the galleys ofthe Grand Signior in the port of Candia. The princi pal damage done by earthquakes to cities adjoining the sea, is often effected by an enormous wave ; the sea, retiring from its bed in the first instance, suddenly returns with a prodigious swell, and in a few moments, rushes over the adjacent country."], [517, "THEORY OF SIR JAMES HALL. 475 Sir James Hall has given greater extension and consistency to this speculation. He supposes, that the upheaving ofa large island like Sumatra, might take place so suddenly, as to drive the ocean with great impetuosity over the summits of the highest mountains, and strip off the glaciers, and transport them into distant countries. Ice being specifically lighter than water, the glaciers would carry away the blocks of stone that had fallen upon them from the impending rocks, and had become incased in ice. This theory of Sir James Hall's, would, I conceive, offer a better explanation than any other, for the occurrence of groups of fragments of parti cular rocks, unmixed with fragments of other rocks. Each glacier, loaded with stones from the rocks above it, may be regarded as a ship freighted with specimens of its native mountains, which it deposits, by thawing, in the place where it ultimately rests. Nor would a wave or swell of the sea, that had covered the highest mountains, suddenly subside ; it would sweep repeatedly over the whole surface of the globe, at a lower and lower level each time ; breaking down opposing obstacles, opening new passages for the water, and scooping out vallies and cols in the softer beds and strata.* On the * Those depressions in a range of mountains, which offer the easiest access in crossing from one valley to another, are in the Alps called Cols. I observed that these cols were all in the softest beds ; and their formation admits of an easy explanation by diluvial action.

At c c the beds are of very soft slate or shale, which has been ex cavated so as to offer a passage over the range, though the"], [518, "476 CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE whole, the theory of Sir James Hall affords perhaps the most satisfactory explanation of diluvian agency that has yet been advanced. But whatever diffi culties may oppose the admission of this or any other theory, the fact that the present continents have been subjected to the action of a deluge, or a mighty rush of waters, which has swept over the highest mountains, seems confirmed by so many coincident phenomena, as scarcely to leave room for doubt. Granting the agency ofa deluge, or a succession of deluges, there are still phenomena left, that their action will not satisfactorily explain. In the mid land counties of England, for instance, there are beds of gravel, and fragments of rock, scattered over hills, that are not only far distant from the rocks which have supplied the fragments, but which are separated from them by deep vallies, over which it is supposed that the fragments could not have been carried, by any power of diluvian agency; for in England, we have not the glaciers to assist in their transportation. It has been imagined, that these fragments and beds of gravel were deposited in their present positions, before the intervening vallies were scooped out. But any subsequent de- highest part is several thousand feet above the valley. Such is the Col de Balm above Chamouni. The beds probably ex tended, at the period of their elevation, in the direction of the dotted lines. These cols could not be formed by rivers, as very little water flows from them. The valley of Derwent (see Plate 4. fig. 1. between the hills 3 and 6,) was evidently formed by the erosion of water, and not by the elevation of its sides; as the beds on each side are the .ame."], [519, "477 LEVEL OF THE LAND AND SEA. luge, sufficiently powerful to scoop out vallies, must also have swept away the loose stones on the sur face. We must therefore admit, either that the water of the deluge covered the earth for some time, during which period the stones and gravel were deposited, and, on retiring rapidly, excavated the softer strata into vallies; or that a great change has since taken place in the level of particular situations, by elevation or subsidence. Many facts appear to prove, that both local and general changes have formerly been effected in the relative level of the land, and the bed of the ocean. The alternations of marine and fresh water formations below the chalk strata, offer a proof of this ; and the occurrence of freshwater shells, and the remains of tree-ferns and marsh plants, in the coal strata, prove the vicinity of dry land, and that these strata were not deposited un der a deep sea, as appears evidently to have been the case with the chalk strata, and also with the magnesian limestone, that immediately covers the coal strata. But not to go so far back in our researches, we have a present proof on the shores of England, of the change which the level land has undergone. A submarine forest, extending far into the sea, may be traced at low water on many of our coasts, and particularly on those of York shire and Lincolnshire. The trees are broken off near the roots, but their stumps are erect, and indi cate that they are in the position in which they have formerly grown. This fact alone may serve to show, that the relative level of the dry land and"], [520, "478 CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE the ocean has not always been the same that it is at present, and may induce us to admit, with less re luctance, the successive subsidences and emersions of the ancient continents, which the alternation ot marine with freshwater strata, directly indicate. It will not be foreign to the present subject to slate, that, from recent accounts of travellers who have visited Thibet, it appears that bones of horses and deer are brought down by avalanches from the Himmaleh mountains, at the height of sixteen thou sand feet, and above the region of eternal snow. Now if this fact be well established, it would indi cate, either that these bones had been deposited there by a deluge, or that the mountains had been raised, since the Asiatic continent was peopled by land quadrupeds analogous to, if not identical with, existing species : for it cannot be supposed, that horses and deer could have subsisted near the sum mits of these mountains, surrounded by snow, and far above the region of vegetation. If ancient tra ditions could be relied upon with as much certainty as the records of nature imprinted on the crust of the globe, we might cite the fact of ancient con tinents having sunk down since the world was peo pled by the human race. Plato, in his dialogue en titled Tim\u00e6us, says, that Solon received an account from the priests of Sais in Egypt, that there was formerly a vast country called the Atlantades, si tuated beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, the inha bitants of which were highly civilized, and flourish ing ; but the whole country was engulphed in the ocean, during a violent earthquake."], [521, "479 LEVEL OF THE LAND AND SEA. The limits of an elementary treatise will not ad mit a greater space for geological theories, or for the further enumeration of facts, that indicate the former action of inundations on the surface of con tinents and islands, and the changes which have taken place in the relative level of the land, and the bed of the ocean. These facts must be admitted, notwithstanding the difficulties that may attend their explanation, for it is not a mere fiction of fancy, that \"Earthquakes have raised to heaven the lowly vale, And gulphs the mountains mighty mass entomb'd, And where the Atlantic rolls, wide continents have bloom'd.\" Beattie. Yet whatever proofs we may have of such changes, they are so remote from our present experience, at least in this part of the globe, that we cannot avoid regarding them as more proper subjects for the poet, than for the sober records of the natural historian. Before I conclude, it may be right to advert to an inquiry that has frequently been made \u2014 What advantage can be derived from the study of Geo logy ? The value of every science must ultimately rest on its utility : but in making the estimate, we ought not to be guided alone by the narrow view of im mediate gain. The material universe appears des tined to answer two important purposes: the first of which, is to provide for the physical wants of its various inhabitants. Now in relation to this pur pose, the science which teaches us the structure of"], [522, "480 CONCLUSION. the earth, and where its mineral treasures may be found, can scarcely be deemed devoid of utility by a nation deriving so much of its comfort and wealth, from its mineral resources. But beside sup- plying our physical wants, the external universe is destined to answer a nobler purpose ; its various ob jects appear intended to excite our curiosity, and stimulate our intellectual powers to the discovery of those laws, by which the successive events we ob- serve in nature are governed. Without this excite- ment, man would for ever remain the mere creature of animal sensation, scarcely advanced above the beasts of the forest; and the universe would be to him a mute and unmeaning succession of forms, sounds, and colours, without connection, order, or design. In those sciences, which have attained the highest degree of perfection, the skill of the Creator, and the ends and uses of the different parts are most apparent. Geology has not yet made suffi cient progress, to carry us far in this path of in quiry ; but we see enough to discover, that the very disorder into which the strata on the surface of the globe are thrown, and the inequalities which it presents, are absolutely necessary to its habitable condition. The distribution of its mineral treasures, and particularly of coal, to the cold and temperate regions of the globe, is well deserving attention, and implies a prospective regard for the wants of civilized man : but a cold-hearted philosophy, under the sanction ofa quaint expression of Lord Bacon*, * \" Causarum finalium inquisitio sterilis est, et tanquam virgo Deo consecrata nihil parit.\""], [523, "481 CONCLUSION. has (to use the words of Dugald Stewart) \" made it fashionable to omit the consideration of final causes entirely, as inconsistent with the acknow ledged rules of sound philosophizing. The effect of this has been to divest the study of Nature of its most attractive charms, and to sacrifice to a false idea of logical rigour, all the moral impressions and pleasures, which physical knowledge is fitted to yield.\" Geology discovers to us proofs of the awful re- volutions which have in former ages changed the surface of the globe, and overwhelmed all its inha- bitants : it reveals to us the forms of strange and unknown animals, and unfolds the \"might and skill of creative energy, displayed in the ancient world : indeed, there is no science which presents ob jects that so powerfully excite our admiration and astonishment. We are led almost irresistibly to speculate on the past and future condition of our planet, and on man, its present inhabitant. What various reflections crowd upon the mind, if we carry back our thoughts to the time when the sur- face of our globe was agitated by conflicting ele- ments, or to the succeeding intervals of repose, when enormous crocodilian animals scoured the surface of the deep, or darted through the air for their prey ; \u2014 or again, to the state of the ancient continents, when the deep silence of nature was broken by the bellowings of the mammoth and the mastodon, who stalked the lords ofthe former world, and perished in the last grand revolution that pre ceded the creation of man. Such speculations are somewhat humbling to human pride on the one 2i"], [524, "482 CONCLUSION. hand, but on the other, they prove our superiority over the rest of the animal creation ; for it has been regarded by the wisest philosophers in ancient times, as a proof of the high future destiny of man, that he alone, of all terrestrial animals, is endowed with those powers and faculties, which impel him to speculate on the past, to anticipate the future, and to extend his views and exalt his hopes, beyond this visible diurnal sphere."], [525, "483 CHAPTER XX AN OUTLINE OF THE GEOLOGY OF ENGLAND AND WALES. The outline ofthe Geology of England, and the map that ac companied it, given in the former edition of this work, presented (the author believes) the first distinct general view of the geo logy of England, that had ever been published ; and though se veral parts of our island have since been more fully examined, the examinations have confirmed the correctness of the leading facts, stated in the editions of 1813 and 1815. Since the latter year, the author has visited and revisited almost every part of England and Wales deserving notice, and had collected materials for a more ample description of their Geology. A work has however been published by Messrs. Co nybeare and Phillips, entitled \"Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales,\" which contains, as far as it has gone, a very detailed and correct description of English Geology. The Rev. W. D. Conybeare, to whom we are indebted for the greater part of the volume, is unfortunately for the cause of science deceased ; but if the work be continued with the same ability, it will leave little further to be desired. In consequence of this publication, the author had intended to omit the following Chapter ; but it has been suggested to him, that many persons who would think a minute description of each rock formation dry and uninviting, might still be desirousof perusing a concise account of the geology oftheir own country. There are also in the present Chapter some observations on the dubious parts of English Geology, which the author trusts may deserve the attention of experienced geologists. N.B. The Contents of this Chapter, and the pages, are given in the Index. See ' Geology of England.' IHE shape of islands and continents, is generally determined by the ranges of primary and transition 2i 2"], [526, "484 THE GREAT ALPINE CHAIN OF ENGLAND mountains that traverse them ; these have been compared to the skeletons, on which the other parts ofa country are constructed. The length of Britain is determined by different groups of mountains, which viewed on a large scale may be regarded as one mountain range, extending north and south (with its ramifications) along the western side ofEngland and Wales, from Cornwall to Cumberland, and from thence to the northern extremity of Scotland. All the highest mountains in England and Wales are situated in this range, which, in reference to our island, may be called the great Alpine chain. This chain is interrupted by the intervention of the Bristol Channel, and the low grounds of Lancashire and Cheshire, which divide it into three groups or ranges ; these, for the sake of distinction, may be denominated the Devo nian range, the Cambrian range, and the Northern range. They form the Alpine districts of England (coloured red in the map). The mountains of the great Alpine chain from Cornwall to Cumberland, are composed of primary rocks and of other rocks, which belong chiefly to the class of transition rocks, described Chap. VII. Those parts in which the primary rocks chiefly occur, are shaded by lines. In some few parts east of the Alpine district, the primary and transition rocks also make their ap pearance, uncovered by the secondary strata. A range of primary and transition mountains appears once to have extended from the Devonian range, in a north-east direction, into Derbyshire: the trans ition mountains of that county, the Charnwood Forest hills, the sienitic greenstone of Warwick-"], [527, "485 AND WALES, DIVIDED INTO THREE RANGES. shire, the transition rocks of Dudley, the Mal vern Hills, and the trap rocks of Gloucestershire, Somersetshire and Devonshire, were probably parts of one range, and were much loftier than at present. It was this range that appears to have determined the extent of our island in that direction, and to have formed the western border of an ancient sea or lake, in which the upper calcareous strata were deposited. It appears also to have determined the extent of the upper calcareous strata, that cover the eastern side of England, and are bounded by the line a a a. This boundary marks the direction of a range of calcareous hills, that extend through England in a waving line, from the western extre mity of Dorsetshire, to the eastern side of the county of Durham. East of this line, there are no beds of mineral coal found in any part of England. Between the line a a a and the Alpine districts (coloured red), we have the under secondary strata (coloured green). All the principal coal formations in England occur in different parts of this district, which, for the sake of distinction, we shall call the Middle district : it is however partly covered by beds of red marie and sandstone. The upper cal careous district, east of the line a a a (and coloured yellow in the map), is in some parts covered with beds of clay and sand of a more recent formation, belonging to the tertiary strata ; they are bounded in the map by the lines o o o o. Other low parts of this district are covered by alluvial depositions. England and Wales may thus be divided into three geological districts : the Alpine district, the"], [528, "486 EXPLANATION OF THE MAP. Middle district, and the Upper Calcareous district; the latter partly covered by tertiary formations. Each of these districts has its appropriate cha racters and mineral productions. In order to give the reader a clear idea of the relative position of the rocks and strata of these three divisions, let him take three sheets of paper, and cut out the form of England in each. Let the lower sheet be red ; cover this with green paper, cutting out all the parts on the western side, which will leave the parts marked red in the map uncovered, and also the small parts where the Malvern Hills and Charnwood Forest hills are situated. Cut out the third sheet of yellow paper, so that its edge may correspond with the line a a a. Then cut out pieces of darker coloured paper, and place them over the parts marked 2 2 2. for the tertiary strata ; and sprinkle sand on the parts marked 1 1 1. for alluvial and diluvial depositions : raise the western edge a little, so as to make the sheets of paper incline to the south-east; \u2014 and we shall then have a model ofthe geology of England, which would be complete, provided we could raise the parts marked red above the level of the green paper. The red paper, which spreads under the whole and represents the primary and transition rocks of the Alpine districts, may be conceived to extend under the sea, and to rise again in Ireland, France, Sweden, and Germany, and thus to be connected with all the granitic ranges of the old continent. It is scarcely re quisite to remark, that in presenting a general view of the arrangement of the different classes of rocks in (his manner, the partial wavings or irregu-"], [529, "THE DEVONIAN RANGE. 487 larities of the strata, and the inequality of surface presented by hills and vallies, must be necessarily disregarded. In the whole of the Alpine district, except that part of it which forms the Devonian range, the rocks of granite are deeply covered by slate rocks, and only make their appearance in a few situations. To begin our description with the Devonian Range, \u2014 suppose the geologist to be landed on the steep granite cliffs at the Land's End in Cornwall; he would perceive west of him the rocks of granite, called the Long Ships, and the more distant Scilly Islands, which were once probably united to Corn wall. This part of Cornwall is chiefly composed of granite, which sometimes passes into porphyry. The granite is frequently covered by slate rocks. A silvery kind of slate, provincially called Killas, appears to occupy the place of mica-slate. At the Lizard Point, the granite is covered by mica-slate, beds of serpentine, and diallage rock or crystallized serpentine*. From the Land's End to Dartmoor, the traveller will pass over a dreary ridge of granite, covered mostly by slate rocks. The surface of the country is every where broken by mines ; there is scarcely a tree visible, and the hills are too low to produce any picturesque effect. At Dartmoor, in Devonshire, the granite rocks approach to a mountainous character, rising to the height of 1700 feet above the level of the sea. * Serpentine also occurs near Liskeard on the eastern side of Cornwall."], [530, "488 THE DEVONIAN RANGE. Rocks of transition limestone occur near the feet of the granite mountains, and also on the southern coast of Devonshire. The western boundary ofthe Devonian range is principally composed of graywacke slate, and trans ition limestone, which extend along the side of the Bristol Channel, into Somersetshire. The Mendip and Quantock hills are part of this range. Steatite or soap-rock, much valued in the manu facture of china, is found at the Lizard Point. Kao lin, or decomposed felspar, employed also in the manufacture of china, and for the finer kinds of pot tery, is afforded by the granite rocks of Cornwall. Slate and marble are supplied from many parts of the Devonian range : but the treasures for which this part ofEngland is most distinguished, are the ores of tin and copper. For the former, our island was visited by the first commercial nations of anti quity. The mines of tin are far from being ex hausted ; but the ore must have been more abun dant formerly, than at present. This is evident, from the pebbles of tin ore, found a little under the surface in the alluvial depositions of Cornwall. Tin ore, or tin stone as it is called by mineralogists, is extremely hard; and there can be little doubt that these water-worn fragments once formed a part of regular veins, which intersected mountains that have been decomposed and worn down. Beside copper, tin, and lead, this range contains ores of silver, cobalt, bismuth, manganese, anti mony, zinc, and iron. Pieces of native gold are occasionally discovered in the sands of rivulets, in a similar situation to stream tin ; some of these pieces"], [531, "THE CAMBRIAN RANGE. 489 are as large as a field bean. All the known metals are found in Cornwall, except platina, mercury, molybdena, tellurium, tantalium, columbium, and cerium. The annual value and produce of the copper and tin from the mines of Cornwall and Devonshire, on an average of several years, may be stated at 75,000 tons of copper ore, value 800,000/. sterling; 3250 tons of metallic tin, value 227,000/. sterling. Crossing the Bristol Channel, we come upon the Alpine district of the Cambrian range, which com prises nearly the whole principality of Wales, and a part of Monmouthshire, Herefordshire and Shrop shire. Nearly the whole of this district is com posed of slate rocks, transition limestone, and gray wacke, and that mode of graywacke, which from its red colour, has been called by English geologists Old red sandstone. The borders of the Bristol Channel, along Pembrokeshire, Caermarthenshire, and Glamorganshire, are covered by coal strata, described p. 151. This part properly belongs to the lower secondary strata of the middle district. The coal strata rest on beds of transition limestone, which rise from under them, on their northern outcrop. The eastern side of this district, as far as Wenlock in Shropshire, is composed of various beds of the old red sandstone, which in some parts passes to the state of common graywacke, and in other parts forms an imperfect porphyry. These beds cover the greater part of Herefordshire and the western border of Monmouthshire; the lowest beds of transition limestone, form a narrow range extending from Caermarthen to Wenlock. Nearly"], [532, "490 THE CAMBRIAN RANGE. the whole of Caermarthenshire, Montgomeryshire, and Radnorshire, are occupied by mountains of slate and graywacke, which present little variety of character ; but near the town of Old Radnor, there are rocks of diallage, and further west, at Llandgley, there is a low range of craggy rocks, composed of cellular clay-stone, which bears a strong resemblance to some varieties of lava. A similar rock covers some part of the Wrekin and Caer Caradock Hills of the trap formation in Shrop shire. In Merionethshire we meet with other rocks, particularly of porphyritic trap, composed chiefly of felspar, which are similar in composition to many ancient rocks of igneous origin, in the South of France. (See Chap. IX. with a reference to Cader Idris, p. 205.) Granite occasionally makes its ap pearance at the feet of some of the Welsh moun tains; and on the western side of the Isle of An glesea, there are rocks of serpentine, talcous slate, and mica-slate. Snowdon in Caernarvonshire, and other moun tains in its vicinity, rise from three thousand four hundred, to three thousand five hundred and seventy feet above the level of the sea, or above three hundred feet higher than any of the mountains in Cumberland. A magnificent view of that part of the Cambrian range which extends through Caernarvonshire, is seen from the southern point of tlie Isle of Anglesea, on the entrance of the Menai : here the whole of the Snowdonian moun tains may be comprised in one view, from Penman inanr on the northern coast, to the conical moun-"], [533, "491 THE NORTHERN RANGE. tains called the Rivals, on the furthest southern extremity of the county, Snowdon rising immedi ately in the midst of this range. In the counties of Flint and Denbigh, there is a large formation of mountain or transition limestone, resting upon thick beds of conglomerate, which occupy the same relative position as the red sand stone in Monmouthshire; thus separating the moun tain limestone from the slate rocks. The limestone mountains of Denbigh and Flintshire contain rich mines of lead ore. On the north and east, the feet of these mountains are covered with coal strata. Roof slate of a good quality, and ores of lead and zinc, form the principal mineral treasures of the Cambrian range, \u2014 except coal, which will be after wards noticed. Some of the slate rocks contain mines of copper ore ; and the Paris mine, in the Isle of Anglesea, was formerly the most productive cop per-mine in Great Britain; but it is now nearly exhausted. For an account of the serpentine in the Isle of Anglesea, see pages 117, 118. Crossing the plains of Cheshire and the lower part of Lancashire, we come upon the transition limestone of the northern range. Near Clithero, in the latter county, where the beds are much con torted, this limestone is fully developed in the northern range, and extends with little interruption from Clithero, through Craven in Yorkshire, and the western parts of Durham and Northumberland, and thence into Westmoreland and Cumberland. The numerous beds of this limestone alternate with graywacke slate, and what may properly be called graywacke sandstone. The lowest bed"], [534, "492 SECTION THROUGH ENGLAND. generally rests on slate, but sometimes a bed of red sandstone or conglomerate is interposed. The slate lies conformably with the limestone; but being divided into thick plates, which are nearly vertical, they have frequently been described as vertical strata, supporting nearly horizontal strata of lime stone. Their true position is represented in Plate 3. fig. \\.d d. The mountain or transition limestone of these counties, forms the base of many lofty mountains, that are capped with the lower strata of the coal formation. Ingleborough Hill in Yorkshire, and Cross Fell in Cumberland, present a complete exhibition of the structure of the calcareous mountains of this range. This will be better understood by a reference to Plate 7. fig. 1. which is a section of England, from the German Ocean to the Irish Channel, through the counties of Durham and Cumberland. The magnesian limestone b, rises above the Ger man Ocean a, and covers the eastern border of the great coal-field of this district. The coal strata c c, are represented dipping eastward ; they are in some parts deranged by dykes of basalt, one of which, the Burtreeford dyke, throws up the strata one hundred and eighty yards. As we advance towards the summit of Cross Fell, 5, we pass over the lower beds of the coal formation ; they termi nate on the summit of this mountain, which is cap ped with a bed of coal. The middle and lower parts of Cross Fell are composed of beds of transi tion limestone, d d, alternating with graywacke and sandstone, which rest at its base on slate, e. The slate is continued westward, till it is inter-"], [535, "493 THE NORTHERN RANGE. rupted by nearly vertical beds of trap and sienite. In the Valeof Eden, the subjacent rocks are covered by beds of conglomerate, or of red sandstone, f, of which the hill called Penrith Beacon, 4, is com posed. The lofty mountains that surround the lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, are skirted by beds of lower transition limestone, h. The highest mountains of this group are Helvellyn 3, Skiddaw 2, Sea Fell I. On the western border of this group we meet with transition limestone, and siliceous sandstone dipping westward ; then suc ceeds the coal strata of Whitehaven, c, which dip beneath the sea, and are in some parts covered with magnesian limestone, b. To return to Cross Fell. The transition limestone, beside being divided into numerous beds, by beds of graywacke and sandstone, has also irregular beds of basalt interposed between the strata. The most considerable of these beds is called the Great Whin Sile ; it is in some parts sixty yards thick. Masses of columnar basalt also occur on the sur- face. According to the account of the strata of this country, given by Mr. Westgarth Forster, the total number of beds of limestone is eighteen, and their total average thickness about one hundred and fifty yards. The basaltic dykes of this dis- trict have been noticed in Chap. IX. In Derby- shire and Wales, the beds of transition limestone are fewer and thicker, than those of Durham and Northumberland. Cross Fell is the highest calca reous mountain in Great Britain, rising 2900 feet above the level of the sea. From its summit, both the Irish Sea and the German Ocean may be seen."], [536, "494 THE NORTHERN RANGE. The Alpine mountains surrounding the lakes arc chiefly composed of slate, containing beds of good roof slate, graywacke, flint slate, porphyritic lel spar, and sienite. Granite occurs in some parts of the group, particularly near Shap, and at Cald beck Fell, under Skiddaw, and in the mountains on the west side of Wast Water. The mountains of this group bear a striking similarity of composition to those of North Wales, and like them contain rocks of porphyry, which appear nearly allied to ancient volcanic rocks. In some situations they assume a columnar structure. The most remark able of those rocks are described pages 192 and 193. There are in some of these mountains beds of red unctuous ferruginous clay and iron-stone. In one of these beds, above Seathwaite in Borrowdale, is found the justly celebrated black-lead, or graphite, which is the best that has hitherto been discovered. It occurs in irregular nodules, intermixed with green earth, quartz, and calcareous spar. I wras informed at the mine, that the smaller pieces sell for seventy pounds per ton, and the larger for forty shillings per pound; and that black-lead to the value of one thousand pounds, had been obtained in one day. The bed above the ferruginous bed contain ing the black-lead, is composed of gray porphyritic felspar; the bed under it, approaches to a green slate (clay-slate). The black-lead occupies what is called a vein, on the lower side of the ferruginous bed : it is generally narrow, but opens out into wider spaces, filled with this valuable mineral. The same bed of ferruginous clay, I have ascer tained, ranges through the adjacent manors, where"], [537, "THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ENGLAND. 495 it is probable black-lead might also be found, were proper search made for it. The highest mountains of Cumberland, West moreland, and Craven in Yorkshire, rise about three thousand feet above the level of the sea. Snow remains on their summits and northern de clivities to the middle of June, and in some in stances has continued the whole year. A branch from the Northern range extends into Derbyshire and the north part of Staffordshire, the transition or mountain limestone of Yorkshire being continued into those counties ; but the continua tion is apparently interrupted by the lower beds of the coal formation, that cover it from Skipton to near Castleton. The limestone of Derbyshire is divided into four beds, by intervening beds of ba saltic amygdaloid ; in all its characters it resembles the transition limestone in other parts of the Northern range, and is described p. 137, 210. The transition limestone of the Northern range is rich in ores of lead and zinc. The middle district ofEngland, (coloured green in the map,) is comprised between the Alpine dis trict on the west, and the Upper Calcareous district (coloured yellow) on the east. In this district, all the principal coal-fields of England and Wales are situated. The strata of the middle district are those described as the lower secondary strata, Chap. IX. They are principally siliceous and ar gillaceous, and the fossil remains are chiefly vege table. Few beds of limestone occur in this divi sion. The general dip of the strata in the northern and midland counties, east of the line c c c, is to"], [538, "496 COAL-FIELDS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. the east, or south-east, and they dip under the cal careous strata a a. The latter cover their eastern border unconformably, as represented Plate 7. fig. 1. b. and Plate 1. fig. 3. The more western and southern parts ofthe division (coloured green) are frequently covered by extensive beds of gravel, and by red marie and sandstone ; and in some parts of this division, primary and transition rocks rise to the surface, as at Charnwood Forest in Leicester shire, and the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire. Beginning from the north, strata of the coal for mation extend on the eastern side of Northumber land and Durham, from Berwick-on-Tweed, to the river Tees ; but from thence to the river Air (near Leeds), only the lowest beds of the coal formation occur, which contain but little workable coal. The Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal-field commences a little north of Leeds, and extends in breadth east and west about twenty-five miles, from Halifax to Abberford, and in length about seventy miles, from Leeds to near Nottingham and Derby. The breadth decreases southward, being little more than twelve miles in Derbyshire. South-west of Derbyshire there are a few small coal-fields near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and near Tam worth, Atherstone, and Coventry. The latter coal field is the most southern situation in which mineral coal has been discovered in the midland counties. On the north-west side ofEngland, there is a small coal-field bordering the sea in Cumberland, which extends from Whitehaven, to the north of Maryport. Thiscoal-field, thoughsmallin extent, contains seven beds of excellent workable coal. From its contiguity"], [539, "497 COAL-FIELDS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. to the sea, and its remoteness from other coal-fields, it may be considered, in proportion to its extent, as one of the most valuable coal districts in England. In one mine, the coal is wrought at the depth of 298 yards. The workings of some mines have been extended under the sea. The next consider- able coal-field is that of Lancashire : it is separated from the Yorkshire coal-field by a range of lofty hills, on the borders of the two counties, extending on the west side of Colne, to Blackstone Edge, and from thence to Axe Edge, on the border of Derby- shire. These hills are principally composed of millstone grit and shale, but are not covered by coal strata. On the western side of these hills, the coal strata ofthe Lancashire coal-field commence, dipping westward ; but they are broken and de- ranged by numerous faults. The principal beds of coal are, \u2014 one of six feet in thickness, and a lower one called the three-quarter bed. In some parts the sandstone strata are of a deep red colour. The breadth of this coal-field from Macclesfield to Oldham, does not exceed five or six miles; but from Oldham, it extends westward to Prescot near Li verpool, and from Prescot it extends in a north east direction to Colne. Not far from the southern extremity of the Lan cashire coal-field, there is a small but valuable coal district, which supplies the potteries near New castle in Staffordshire ; this may properly be consi dered as an extension of the Lancashire coal-field. The next important coal-field is that of Dudley and Wolverhampton ; it is about twenty miles in length, and varies in width from four to seven 2 E_"], [540, "498 COAL-FIELDS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. miles. It contains the thickest bed of coal in Great Britain. (See page 155.) There is a narrow coal-field on the north-eastern border of Wales, extending from Mostyn in Flintshire, to Chirk in Denbighshire. There are also a few smaller coal fields on the north-eastern side of Herefordshire, which extend into Shropshire. The Clee Hills near Ludlow contain, on their sides, two or three small detached coal basins. The summits of these lofty hills are capped with basalt. The coal basin ofthe Forest of Dean, is the next considerable repository of coal: it presents perhaps the most perfect model of a coal basin, of any in Great Britain ; the coal strata occupy a space of about ten miles in length, and six in breadth : the millstone grit, and the transition limestone, on which they lie, may be distinctly observed cropping out on its northern and western boundary. In Somersetshire and Gloucestershire, there is a considerable coal-field on each side of the river Avon ; its greatest extent is about twenty miles, and its greatest ascertained breadth about eleven miles ; but it is covered in many parts by the upper secondary strata, consisting of red marie and lias. The deepest coal mine in England is in this coal field ; the depth of the pit at Red Stock near Bath being 409 yards. The greatest repository of coal in our island, is that which extends on the northern side of the Bristol Channel, one hundred miles in length, and varying in breadth from five to twenty miles. It has been already noticed, Chap. VIII. pages 151 and 181."], [541, "ROCK. SALT, AND BRINE SPRINGS. 499 A considerable part of the middle district, (co loured green in the map,) which is not occupied by the coal formations above enumerated, is covered by the red marie and sandstone described in Chap. IX. As the sandstone of this formation often covers the coal strata, it becomes an object of great interest to landed proprietors, in the midland counties, who have estates at no great distance from the coal districts, to ascertain whether coal may not extend under the red marie and sand stone. Some observations on this subject are given (pages 174 and 175), which the author is persuaded deserve the attention of landed proprietors. The search for coal under the red marie and sandstone in Somersetshire, has been eminently successful; and coal has in some instances been found, by sinking through both lias and red sandstone. The principal repositories of rock salt, and the strongest springs of brine, are situated in the red marie of Cheshire, and near Droitwich in Wor cestershire. (See pages 248 and 250.) In this formation, the principal beds of gypsum are found : it is frequently associated with rock salt. (See Chap. XI.) One ofthe most remarkable features ofthe mid dle district, is the occasional occurrence of consi derable rocks of granite, slate, and sienite, belong ing to the class of primary or transition rocks ; they rise through the secondary strata, and appear, from various circumstances, to have once occupied a considerable portion of the midland counties, extending from Leicestershire to Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, 2 k. 2"], [542, "500 PRIMARY ROCKS IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES. and Devonshire. The rocks of porphyry, sienite, and granite in this district, like many similar rocks that have been observed in other parts of the world, appear to be closely associated with, and to pass into rocks of the trap formation, allied to basalt and volcanic rocks. (See an instance ofthe passage of granite into basalt, page 190.) The Charnwood Forest hills in Leicestershire, extend about ten miles from S.E. to N. W. rising from six to eight hundred feet above the circumjacent country; they represent in miniature the mountains of North Wales, and those in the vicinity of the Lakes. They are principally composed of flinty slate, roof slate, porphyritic trap, porphyritic greenstone, sie nite, and granite. No organic remains have been observed in any of the Forest rocks, nor in the slate-quarries which have been extensively worked for many years. Veins of white quartz containing chlorite intersect these hills, particularly in that part between Bardon Hill and the town of Whit wick. No appearance of any metallic substance occurs in these veins *, nor is pyrites found in any of the rocks which I examined : a rock containing a great quantity of yellow mica, at a place called Basil Wood, is an imperfect mica-slate, passing into gneiss. The roof-slate is principally confined to the eastern side ; and on this side the beds are more regular, and rise at a very elevated angle to the south-west. The slaty cleavage of the stone is nearly at right angles with the direction of the beds. All the rocks of this district, except the por- * Except a few spangles of micaceous iron ore."], [543, "501 CHARNWOOD FOREST HILLS. phyritic rocks on the west side, have a tendency to assume pyramidal forms; and the stone divides into trapezoids with smooth faces, by which they may be distinguished at a distance, from any other stones in that part of England. The changes by which the different kinds of rock pass into each other, are similar to those de scribed by D'Aubuisson in the department of La Doire*. In the same rock, the upper bed will sometimes be porphyritic and the next compact ; and sometimes from the same bed, small specimens might be broken, which will present the two cha racters on the opposite sides. The large-grained sienite of one rock, becomes smaller-grained in another; and in the adjoining rock it will be por phyritic, and pass by gradation into flinty slate with small crystals of felspar. Veins of dark and nearly compact greenstone, intersect the sienite at Mount Soar Hill. The sides of the vein are intermixed, and closely united with the rock. The granitic rocks of Mount Sorrel are sepa rated from the slate rocks by a plain, called Rokeby plain, which prevents their junction from being traced on this side ; they have a lower elevation than the slate, which is inclined, as if it rose from under them. Bardon Hill is composed of sienitic * \"Le passage d'une de ces varietes de roche a I'autre, prove nant de la difference dans les proportions des principes, est aussi brusque qu'il est frequent.

These are the two highest hills in the Forest. The gradations from sienite to porphyry slate and flinty slate, are frequent on the western side of the Forest. The only mineral substances obtained from these hills is roof-slate, paving-stones, and a species of whetstone or hone ; this is not found in a regular bed, but in fragments under the soil. The beau tiful green and red sienite at Markfield Knowl might be employed for durable ornamental archi tecture ; large pyramidal blocks are scattered over the hill ; and were a quarry opened near the sum mit, the stone might probably be raised in large masses at a small expense. The porphyritic rocks near Whitwick, particu larly one called Sharpless, are composed ofa dark purplish gray compact porphyry slate ; it contains numerous crystals of quartz, and some imperfect garnets. The rocks on this side of the Forest are singularly shattered, and presentdeep perpendicular fissures, in some instances covered by transverse stones of immense size; they form piles of shapeless ruins, showing the devastation ofthe elements, and the effects of all-destroying time. I have been more minute in the description of this part of England than may appear consistent with the mere outline of its geology, which I pro posed to give ; but so little was known respecting the mineralogy of these hills, though in the centre of the island, that I trust I shall be excused for this deviation. The country presents few scenes to allure the picturesque traveller, and the surface is"], [545, "THEIR RELATION WITH THE ADJACENT STRATA. 503 now nearly concealed by plantations and inclosures. The observations were made during a mineralo gical examination of some of the manors on the Forest, for the late Marquis of Hastings in 1812. But it is the relation of these hills with the sur rounding strata, that is most interesting to the logist. On the northern side, at Grace Dieu, are strata of transition limestone, which risegently to the Forest hills, and are connected with a series of rocks of the same formation, passing in a northerly direc tion by Ticknall and Breedon, and evidently con necting this limestone with that of Derbyshire. A little north of this, there are coal strata rising at an elevated angle, not more than 800 yards distant from the Forest rocks. On the north-west side of the range, there are thick beds of conglomerate, evidently formed of fragments of the Forest rocks: these conglomerate beds extend far north ward. Between the elevated coal strata, and the Forest rocks, there are horizontal strata of the red marie and sandstone formation. The same sandstone covers the nearly vertical beds of slate at the Swithland quarries, and extends on the eastern side of the range, where it is covered with lias limestone. The relative position of these different forma tions will be better understood by referring to Plate 2. fig. 4. bb. rocks of granite, sienite, and por phyry; cc. slate rocks; dd. coal strata rising to wards the Forest rocks ; a a a. nearly horizontal strata of sandstone, covering part of the Forest rocks ; e, lias covering the sandstone.

This arrangement of the strata, proves that the beds of sandstone, a a a, were deposited after the elevation of the beds of granite and slate, (See pages 223 to 225. Chap. X.) where it is inferred that the granite of this range is more ancient than the granite of the Alps. Taking Charnwood Forest as a sta tion, from whence we would examine the geology of the central parts of England, we find no rocks on the northern side, in Derbyshire, Nottingham shire, or Yorkshire, which can claim relationship with those of the Charnwood range, except it be the basalt of Derbyshire. The sienite and porphy ritic trap-rocks on Charnwood Forest, sometimes approximate in appearance to basalt; and it is not improbable that future observations may establish a close connection between these rocks. The transition limestone, which approaches the Charn wood Forest hills on this side, is a continuation of that of Derbyshire. Turning to the south-west, we find rocks of the Charnwood Forest range ap pearing above the surface, on the road to Hinckley; and it can scarcely be doubted, that the green stone and trap and quartz rock, near Atherstone and Nuneaton, are a part of the same range : they are identical in composition, and divide into the same trapezoidal fragments. From Nuneaton to Dudley and Bromsgrove Lickey, on the west of Birmingham, the surface is covered with the red sandstone ; and no accurate search has been made to ascertain, whether any basaltic or granitic rocks appear in situ. At Bromsgrove Lickey, quartz rock makes its appearance; and near Dudley, there"], [547, "505 STRATA NEAR DUDLEY. are beds of transition limestone and basaltic rocks, which may probably be connected with those of Nuneaton. The geology of the country round Dudley is too remarkable to be overlooked ; it has been slightly noticed p. 136. The strata of transition limestone have here been subjected to a disturbing force, which has not only elevated them, but folded them round one of the hills, as if they had once been in a soft and flexible state; and the occurrence of ba saltic rocks in the vicinity, seems to indicate the agent by which this had been effected. (See Plate 3. fig. 4.) _, b, two beds of transition limestone ; the thickness of the outer is ten, and of the inner bed fourteen yards. In the hill a on the right, called Wren's Nest Hill, the strata are folded round the hill, as represented in the small compartment e, which is a ground plan. The beds of the same limestone at Dudley Castle Hill, b, are raised on each side of the hill, dipping in contrary directions. The great bed of Staffordshire coal, crops out at c, between Wren's Nest Hill, and Dudley Castle Hill. A hill capped with basalt is represented at d. The limestone is so nearly vertical at Wren's Nest Hill, that it is worked by horizontal shafts. Proceeding westward from Bromsgrove Lickey into Worcestershire, the first granitic rocks we meet with, are those ofthe Malvern Hills. These hills extend for about ten miles from north to south ; they rise above the level vale of the Severn, from eleven to fourteen hundred feet, and form a con spicuous feature in the geology of the western counties. These granitic rocks are principally com-"], [548, "MALVERN HILLS, &C 506 posed of red felspar, and greenish hornblende, in termixed with quartz, mica, and epidote. In some parts the hornblende prevails, and the rock passes to greenstone, resembling that of the trap forma tion. These rocks are rapidly disintegrating, and form a red soil. On the eastern side at the bottom, they are covered by red marie, which appears formed of the decomposed materials of these hills : on the western side, they are partly covered by transition limestone. The limestone in some parts, dips towards the granitic rocks, as if it passed under them. An experiment well deserves to be made, in order to ascertain the relative position of the lime stone and granite in this place : it is not impossible, that the granite of the Malvern Hills, like that of Christiania in Norway, may cover transition lime stone. To the south-west of the Malvern Hills, we find trap-rocks ranging from Berkley towards Bris tol. One of these rocks at Woodford Bridge, has been described p. 208. The surface of the land between Bristol and Bridgewater is much broken by the sea ; but in that direction, on the north of Exeter, there are rocks called dunstone, and greenstone, of the trap formation ; and from Exe ter to Torbay, we meet with various groups of rock, ofa similar formation. It well deserves at tention, that all these rocks which have been de scribed from Charnwood Forest to Torbay, are, with the exception of those of Dudley, partly sur rounded by red marie and sandstone, which appears in a great measure formed of their decomposed materials. I observed a similar connection between"], [549, "UPPER CALCAREOUS DISTRICT. 507 red marie and granite, near Rouvray in France. (See pages 244, 255.) The part of England extending from Gloucester to Lancaster, which is represented in Mr. Greenough's map, as covered by red marie and sandstone, will probably be found on more minute investigation, to contain in various parts, beside the red marie, other formations. The red sandstone of Lancashire and Cheshire, often bears a different relation to the coal strata, from that on the eastern side of England : it cuts off the coal like a wall of basalt. The upper calcareous district on the eastern side of England, (bounded by the line a a a, and co loured yellow in the map), comprises all the upper secondary strata, except the red marie and sand stone, called by English geologists the new red sandstone. It has been before observed, that no beds of good mineral coal, nor any workable veins of metallic ore, are found east of the line a a a in any part of England. The eastern boundary of this district, from the mouth of the Tyne to Not tingham, is composed of strata of magnesian lime stone, described pages 238, 239. They form low ranges of hills, bordering the coal strata. The breadth ofthe magnesian limestone on the surface, through Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, seldom exceeds seven miles. A little east of Nottingham, the lias limestone (which extends in a waving line from the Yorkshire coast, north of Gainsborough) approaches the termination ofthe magnesian lime stone, and is continued along the line a a a from Nottinghamshire through Leicestershire, War wickshire, to near Tewksbury ; from thence it"], [550, "508 EXTENT OF LIAS IN ENGLAND. runs on the southern side of the Severn to Glou cester. From the vale of Severn, it is continued through Somersetshire and Dorsetshire, to Lyme (in the latter county), where it is terminated by the sea. At its two extremities, on the Yorkshire coast and the coast of Dorsetshire, it forms lofty cliffs, which are remarkable for the variety of their fos sils : the cliffs of Dorsetshire have furnished the most perfect skeletons of saurian animals that, have yet been discovered. The lias, in its course from Yorkshire to Dorsetshire, rarely attains the eleva tion of 200 feet. The beds of lias clay and limestone are the best characterized of any of the British stra ta : they are described at some length Chap. IX. In passing through Somersetshire, the continuity of the lias is sometimes interrupted by intervening strata of other formations ; but from Berkley in Gloucestershire, to Whitby in Yorkshire, it may be traced without any interruption, except what is occasioned by rivers that cut through it. The average breadth of the lias, from its western border, where the red marie commences, to its eastern border where it dips under the yellow limestone or oolite, varies from seven to ten or twelve miles. The situations where it may be best ob served, is on the Dorsetshire coast east and west of Lyme, and at Whitby in Yorkshire. At Aust Passage on the Severn, it may be seen resting im mediately on red marie ; and the remarkable stra tum, filled with the bones of fish and saurian ani mals, may be traced for a considerable distance. The sulphate of strontian, which is a rare English mineral, occurs here in considerable quantities in"], [551, "509 EXTENT OF OOLITE. the red marie, under thelias. Westbury Cliff, where the bone stratum again appears, is described p. 33. The lias limestone is quarried in various parts of its course for water-setting lime. A range of lofty hills, composed of yellowish limestone of the oolite formation, (see Chap. XI.) extends from Dorsetshire to the north of Lincoln shire; oolite appears again on the Cleveland Hills in Yorkshire. The lower beds in these hills rest on lias. The western boundary, as far as Notting hamshire, is a little east of the line a a a. In Gloucestershire the hills of this range attain a con siderable elevation, rising 900 feet or more above the vale of Severn. They present their steep sides or escarpments to the west, and in standing on the summit of this range above the vale of Severn, a very interesting inquiry naturally suggests itself; \u2014 for here the beds of oolite terminate, and are no where found on the other side of the Severn, or in any part of England or Wales, to the west of the line a a a : the lias also terminates a few miles west of the Severn *. \u2014 Have the beds of oolite which form this range of hills, or have the beds of lias at their feet, ever ex tended much further than at present ? If they have not, we must then inquire, by what cause has their further extent westward been impeded ? Some detached hills of oolite occur in the vale of Severn, which have evidently been once conti nuous with the Cotswold Hills; but we have no * A small patch of lias is found on the north side of the Bristol Channel."], [552, "510 TERMINATION OF OOLITE. reason to believe, that either the oolite or the lias have ever extended into any part of England west ofthe vale of Severn. In Ireland and in the He brides, the lias beds again make their appearance. The beds ot the oolite formation, with associated beds of clay, cover a considerable part of Glouces tershire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Rutland shire, and the eastern side of Lincolnshire. They also extend into the east riding of Yorkshire, and terminate at the Cleveland Hills. The oolite formation is divided into the lower, the middle, and the upper oolite ; \u2014 the Portland stone belongs to the upper oolite. Between the middle and the lower oolite, there is a bed of clay, called Clunch clay, and Oxford clay ; it is in some parts two hundred feet thick ; many of its fossils are similar to those in the lias. Clunch clay covers a considerable part of the low land in Huntingdon shire, Bedfordshire, Oxfordshire, and may be traced southward through Wiltshire. (See p. 272.) Between the upper and the middle oolite, there is also an other thick bed of clay, called Kimmeridge clay. (See p. 273.) For a more full account of the oolite formation, see Chap. XII. The animal remains in the various beds, from the magnesian limestone to the upper oolite, are exclusively marine, with the remarkable exception at Stonesfield, (See page 274 ;) but the strata be tween the upper oolite, and the greensand below chalk, contain river shells and bones of immense animals of the lizard family, some of which were more than sixty feet in length; and from the struc ture of their teeth, they are believed to have been"], [553, "CHALK, AND FRESHWATER STRATA BELOW CHALK. 511 herbivorous. The strata containing remains of freshwater animals, are described Chap. XIII. un der the name of Purbeck beds, iron-sand, and weald clay. A bed of sand and sandstone intermixed with green particles, lies under chalk, and accompanies it throughout the southern and eastern counties. The fossils in the greensand and chalk are marine. (See Chap. XIII.) Greensand and chalk extend into Devonshire, where they occur detached from the great chalk formation, which begins east of Dorchester, and extends through part of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Sussex; and through Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Hertfordshire, into Cambridgeshire and Suf folk. A small extent of chalk is exposed on the north coast of Norfolk, and it passes through the middle of Lincolnshire, and on the eastern side of Yorkshire, to Flamborough Head, where it termi nates. (See Chap. XIII.) The highest elevation which chalk attains, is at Inkpen Beacon in Hamp shire, which is 1011 feet above the level of the sea. The remarkable derangement of the chalk strata, which has thrown the beds into a vertical position in the Isle of Wight (See page 325), extends also through the Isle of Purbeck in Dorsetshire. The chalk in the southern counties of England, is in some situations covered with thick beds of clay and sand, which belong to the tertiary for mation. The organic remains found in these beds belong to different species from those in the chalk. The vale of Thames, between the chalk hills of Surrey on the south, and the chalk hills of Hert-"], [554, "512 TERTIARY STRATA IN ENGLAND. fordshire on the north, is covered with tertiary beds. (See the map, fig. 2 2 2.) The upper clay has been called the London clay ; and the lower, the plastic clay : the lower clay extends westward, beyond the limits of the upper, as represented in the map. A small section across the vale of Thames from north to south, at the bottom of the map, will convey a clear idea of the relative posi- tion of the chalk, the plastic clay, and the London clay, ln some situations, as at Hampstead on the north of London, and near Cobham on the south, the London clay rises above the Vale, to the height of 300 feet, and is covered with a stratum of ma- rine sand, as represented at d d in the section. Here we have one of the most simple cases of de- nudation. There can be but little doubt, that these caps of sand were once parts of one continu- ous stratum, but the intervening clay and sand have been subsequently excavated by diluvial agency. (See Chap. XIV. page 305.) Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are partly covered by tertiary strata, as represented in the map, and described pages 324 to 327, Chap. XIV., where a more full ac- count of the geology of this part of England is given. The crag of Norfolk and Suffolk, which belongs to the tertiary formation, is described pages 320 and 321. A considerable part of the counties of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and the eastern side of Lincoln shire, fall within the division of the map marked 111. The surface is fen land or marshes, gained from the sea in the Wash of Cambridgeshire, and the fen country of Lincolnshire ; but a great"], [555, "513 SUBTERRANEAN FORESTS. part of Norfolk is covered by beds of gravel, sand, and clay, intermixed with fragments of chalk. Beds of flint-gravel, and fragments of ancient rocks (it has been before observed) are widely spread over the midland counties, but could not be introduced into the map. There is a subterranean forest beneath a part of Holderness in Yorkshire, and in parts of Cam bridgeshire and Lincolnshire, which extends east ward into the German Ocean below the low-water mark. The inland subterranean forest is also be low the level of the sea. A similar subterranean forest occurs on the Lan cashire coast, north of Liverpool, and extends into the Irish Channel. These facts prove, that a con siderable change has taken place in the relative level ofthe sea and land. A subterranean forest on the Norfolk coast is noticed page 321. Mr. Taylor, who has examined its position, says, that it rests on the stratum called Norfolk Crag, and is covered by diluvium : he is inclined to refer it to the lignite formations of the tertiary strata. If this can be ascertained, the Norfolk subterranean forest, and the same forest which extends into Yorkshire, must be regarded as being of antediluvian origin. But these subter ranean forests in England, deserve more attention than they have hitherto received from geologists ; the period of their growth, and the causes by which they were submerged, are at present unknown. A similar subterranean forest extends into the sea on the coast of Flanders. Have these forests been once 2 L"], [556, "514 TEMPERATURE OF united and afterwards separated by a subsidence, which formed the bed ofthe German Ocean ? In a general view of the Geology of England, the thermal waters must not be neglected. The warm springs in Derbyshire vary in temperature from 58 to 82 degrees, though each spring pre serves the same degree of heat, except in situa tions where the waters have been intermixed with those near the surface. The effects of internal heat, appear to extend under the whole district that contains basaltic amygdaloid or toad-stone; for the rivers of this county are rarely frozen, ex cept in still situations, and when the thermometer is little more than 10 degrees above zero. A very sensible degree of warmth may be perceived in the water of the Crumford canal, between Matlock and Crich ; and numerous exhalations from warm springs, may be frequently seen rising from the neighbouring hills. The warm springs of Bath, have a much higher temperature than those of Derbyshire. It has been remarked, that warm springs are principally confined to basaltic and vol canic countries. In Iceland, in the Azores, in Sicily, in Italy, in France, and various parts of Europe, not distant from volcanic or basaltic rocks, numerous warm springs exist ; but in the whole of the United States of America, where there are few basaltic rocks, warm springs are scarcely known. These remarks are confirmed by the situation of the warm springs in Derbyshire, surrounded by beds of basaltic rock nearly allied to lava. The hot springs of Somersetshire are situated on the"], [557, "WARM SPRINGS. 515 western side of the island, not far from a range of basaltic rocks, extending from Berkley towards Bristol. It will scarcely be denied that the boiling fountains or geysers of Iceland, and the warm springs of Italy, Sicily, and Auvergne, derive their temperature from subterranean fire ; and it is con trary to the established rules of philosophy, to mul tiply causes, and seek for other sources of heat, in the waters of Bath or Buxton. The former have preserved their high tempera ture for two thousand years : hence it is obvious that they rise from a great depth, far below the effects of those changes, which take place near the surface. It is further remarkable, that the hot wells of Bath, and the boiling fountains of Iceland, both contain in solution siliceous earth, one of the most insoluble substances in nature. The similarity of their contents, affords a further confirmation that they derive their heat from the same cause; and we have every proof the subject will admit of, that this cause is subterranean fire *. * Temperature of the Hot Waters in England, and some other parts of Europe.

The rocks of the transition series, rarely oc cur in two distant situations in the same order of succession, and preserving the same degree of thickness. The secondary strata of the coal forma tion, preserve a considerable degree of regularity over the same district, but they almost always vary in remote districts. According to a section that was made across the coal-field of Derbyshire, from the magnesian limestone in the east, to the fourth limestone of Derbyshire in the west, the total thick ness in a perpendicular line, maybe about nine hun dred yards. There are thirteen beds of coal, vary in\"- in thickness from six inches to eleven feet ; the total thickness of coal is twenty-six yards. The thickness of all the beds on the eastern side of the coal districts, from magnesian limestone to chalk, is a question of some interest to landed pro prietors ; as a knowledge of it would inform them, how far their estates were situated above the coal strata, supposing the latter to extend on the eastern side of the line a a a. According to an estimate by the Rev. J. Townsend, given in the former editions of this work, the total thickness of all the upper strata, including chalk and the red marie, did not ex ceed about 1710 feet; but more accurate observa tions of these secondary strata prove, that in many parts ofEngland, their thickness is far greater than"], [559, "517 THE DIFFERENT BEDS. Mr. Townsend had estimated, and can scarcely be less than three thousand feet. There are, how ever, no known situations in England, where all the upper secondary strata, from chalk to the red marie or magnesian limestone, occur regularly under each other. Still the vast thickness of these calcareous beds, forbids the attempt to search for coal beneath them. There may, however, be parts situated east of the line a a a, where the upper strata are stripped off, or the lower coal strata forced up near the sur face. An instance of this kind well deserving atten tion, occurs in France, about twelve miles to the N.E. of Boulogne. A small portion of the regular coal formation, and the subjacent transition limestone, appears protruded through the chalk and oolite for mations ; and several beds of coal are brought near the surface, and are regularly worked.

In a preceding part of the present chapter, 1 have suggested an inquiry into the causes which have prevented the extension of the thick beds of oolite and lias, beyond the line marked in the map a a. It is evident, that the strata have not been discontinued by a failure of the materials of which they are composed ; for they no where appear more fully developed, or in greater strength, than where they form the southern border of the Vale of Severn, and suddenly terminate. I am much inclined to be lieve, that we must seek for the cause of their dis continuance to the north-west, from a range of lofty mountains having once extended from the Mal vern Hills (in a north-east direction) to Charnwood Forest, and in a south-west direction into Devon shire. The Malvern Hills, the Charnwood Forest hills, and the transition rocks of Somersetshire and Devonshire, are the only remaining nuclei of this range. This range probably formed the northern border of an ancient sea, of which the Forez mountains, and the Vosges in France were the southern border. Were it not so, why should the lias and the oolite always terminate as they ap proach these rocks, both in England and France ? If the Malvern range were once far loftier than at present, it might have formed part ofa continent, or island, when all the land to the south and south east was buried under the ocean. On this island may have lived the land quadrupeds, whose remains are found in the slate of Stonesfield (p. 274). These bones, carried into the then existing sea by rivers,"], [561, "ANCIENT SURFACE OF ENGLAND. 519 may have been borne further south by marine cur rents, and left among the calcareous and arena ceous depositions, of which the Stonesfield slate is composed. If we trace the upper calcareous strata from their inland termination to the sea, we must be convinced, that they have once extended further to the south and east. The chalk cliffs at Dover, for instance, and the lias cliffs at Lyme, are evi dently parts of more extensive strata, of which we find a continuation on the opposite coast of France ; and the chalk cliffs at Flamborough Head, and the lias cliffs at Whitby, are parts of strata, which were continued into Denmark and Germany, where the same strata are again met with. But though the upper calcareous strata evidently extended further than the coast of England on the south and east, there are no vestiges of these strata in England, west of the above line, except a small portion of lias at the feet of the transition moun tains, on each side of the Bristol Channel. We have indeed reason to believe, that the lias and oolite never extended far beyond their present inland limits in England*; for we have decisive proof on the southern coast, that the lias beds did not extend further west on that coast, at the period when the greensand and chalk were deposited ; as we find the latter carried over the termination of the lias beds, to the red marie beyond themf. But * It has been before stated, that the lias is found in the He brides, and on the north of Ireland ; but it was probably de posited in a sea that was separated from the English lias by the Malvern range, and the mountains of Wales and Cumberland. t This will be better understood by referring to Plate 3. fig. 1."], [562, "520 ANCIENT SURFACE OF ENGLAND.

Additional Observations on Stratification. _l_ HE appearance of vertical and horizontal strata in the same rock (as represented Plate 1. fig. 5), is of very rare occurrence in this country ; such a position can only be effected by a fault, which had thrown the strata on one side into a vertical position. The appearance represented in the above figure, is however, frequently to be observed in the calcareous strata adjoining the Alps, where the vertical divisions are not true strata, but seams or partings, which sometimes are so considerable, as to efface the true strata seams : this has hitherto been little understood, and has been the source of much error in geological descriptions. The reader must suppose the horizontal lines to be continued through the vertical .earns. The appearance of contorted stratification (Plate 2. fig. 5.) is an optical illusion. The strata originally infolded the mountain like the coats of an onion, but have partly fallen off, one behind the other, leaving waving edges, (like the letter S,) overlapping each other. Original inequalities in the general curvature of the beds, may have occasioned the strata to break off in this manner. The Montagne de Tuille near Montmelian, (which is drawn in the third volume of Saussure's Voyages dans les Alpes,) offers, I conceive, an instance of this apparent contortion, which Saussure considered as almost inexplicable. I examined the mountain from various sta tions, and am persuaded, that the contortions are only apparent, and are not like the real contortions, which the lower beds of transition limestone in this country so frequently present. Page 1 76. \u2014 In the Chapter on Coal, I proposed to offer some ob servations in the Appendix, on the ineffective means hitherto adopted to prevent the frequent recurrence of fatal accidents in coal mines : but on due consideration, the subject is important to be confined to a note, and would be misplaced in an elementary"], [564, "522 APPENDIX. work on Geology. The number of lives destroyed by explosions in coal mines, has, I believe, been increased since the introduction of the safety-lamp ; from causes which do not invalidate the value of the discovery, if its use were confined within the limits which its illustrious inventor must have proposed. On Freshwater Fish and Shells. In the second edition of this work 1 offered, in a note, some observations on the difficulty of determining whether certain ani mals were marine or freshwater, as it was possible that fish and many testaceous animals, might be capable of living either in the sea or in rivers. I stated a circumstance communicated to me by Mr. Leckie, which proves that fish have greater facilities of change, than na turalists generally suppose. Dr. MacCulloch has since paid atten tion to the subject, and ascertained that many species of fish will live equally well in fresh or salt water. The fact has been long known in Sicily, with respect to the mullet. The lake of Lentini in Sicily is stocked with a sea fish called the Cefalo, \u2014 a species of mullet caught in the Mediterranean, and thrown into the fresh water of the lake, where they not only live, but increase greatly in size and improve in flavour, and are a considerable article of luxury in the island. This lake has no communication with the sea, and is chiefly filled with rain water. On the Surface ofthe Moon. Geologists have not hitherto regarded with due attention the physical structure of the moon : it is the only planetary body placed sufficiently near us to have the inequalities of its surface rendered distinctly visible with the telescope. Attendant on the earth, and having the same quantity of solar light, and nearly the same density, we may reasonably infer, that the mineral sub stances of which it is composed, do not differ essentially from those on the surface of our own planet. Astronomers now generally admit, that the moon is surrounded with a very clear atmosphere, but which is so low, that it scarcely occasions a sensible refraction of the rays of light, when it passes over the fixed stars. Many of the dark parts of the moon, particularly the part called Mare Cri sium, appear to be covered with a fluid, which may probably be more transparent and less dense than water, as the form of the"], [565, "523 APPENDIX. rocks and craters beneath it are seen, but not so distinctly, as in the lighter parts of the moon's surface. To examine the moon with a reference to its external structure, the defining power of the telescope should be of the first quality, sufficient to show the projections of the outer illuminated limb as distinctly, as they ap pear when the moon is passing over the disk of the sun, during a solar eclipse. With such a telescope, and a sufficient degree of light and of magnifying power, almost every part of the moon's surface appears volcanic, containing craters of enormous magni tude and vast depth : the shelving rocks, and the different internal ridges within them, mark the stations at which the lava has stood and formed a floor, during different eruptions ; while the vol canic cones in some of the craters, resemble those formed within the craters of modern volcanoes. The largest volcanic mountain on the southern limb of the moon, (called by some astronomers Tycho, and by others Mount Sinai,) like the largest volcanic mountain on the earth, Chimbo razo, and like Mont D'Or and the Puy de Ddme in Auvergne, has no deep crater on its summit. There are indeed the outlines of the crater, but it is nearly filled up ; while from the foot of this mountain, diverging streams of lava flow in different directions, to the distance of six hundred miles. The largest currents of lava from lofty volcanoes on the earth, generally issue from their flanks. The longest known current of modern lava is in Iceland ; it ex tends sixty miles, but the volcanoes in that island, bear no propor tion to the magnitude of the lunar volcanoes. Geologists who are reluctant to admit the extensive agency of fire on the surface of the terrestrial globe, would have their diffi culties removed, were they to study attentively the surface of the moon with a powerful telescope ; for there we see the entire hemi sphere of a planetary body, subjected to the agency of volcanic fire. Since my return from the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, I have frequently amused myself in comparing the structure of parts of the moon's surface, with that of the volcanic'districts in Central France ; and I could scarcely avoid the conclusion, that the sum mits of many volcanic mountains in the moon, which reflect so much more light than the other parts, are, like those in Auvergne, composed of rocks analogous to white pumice or trachyte. I have suggested these hints, to direct the attention of geologists and astronomers to our attendant planet. Is it inhabited ? Is it passing to a habitable slate ? or does it present the ruins of a"], [566, "524 APPENDIX. former habitable globe, torn by the powerful agency of volcanic fire ? Its appearance 6eems most to agree with the latter condition. Perhaps the perfection to which telescopes are advancing on the Continent, may enable astronomers at no distant period to an- swer these questions. Orbicular Porphyry and Orbicular Granite cf Corsica. These are two of the most rare and beautiful rocks ; but little is known respecting their relation with other rocks in that island. According to specimens of considerable size, which 1 have before me, this porphyry is composed of compact felspar, varying in co- lour from a greenish to a reddish brown. The globules vary in diameter from one- third of an inch to three-inches. The most per- fectly formed globules have a small globule in the centre of each, from which ranges of minute globules diverge, giving to the large globules the appearance of a radiated diverging structure, more or less regular. In the smaller globules there are concentric circles, which disappear in the larger ones, except near their superficies. The paste in which these globules are imbedded, contains also minute globules of lighter-coloured felspar, variously arranged. Thc larger globules are some of them elongated, as if they had been in fusion. The experiments of Mr. G. Watt on basalt, (See page 213,) elucidate the formation of orbicular porphyry. The globular structure was probably developed during the semi liquefaction of the mass, which formed globules, instead of perfect crystals, as in common porphyry. The globules in the Corsican porphyry, can be easily detached from the mass. Common por phyry, in which the imbedded felspar occurs in rounded spots, is called Variolite. The orbicular granite of Corsica is better known in this country ; it is a finely granitic rock, composed of white felspar, and blackish green hornblende, with grains of quartz. In this rock are nu merous globules composed of concentric coats of hornblende and felspar, varying in diameter from one inch to three or four inches. In the centre of each globule, there is a particle of hornblende. The globules appear intimately united wilh the rock in which they are imbedded, and cannot be detached from it. The orbicular granite takes a more even polish than the porphyry, and is one of the most beautiful granitic rocks."], [567, "525 APPENDIX.
