The noble Bedford could not rise above the age in which he lived : but that was the age of gal lantry and chivalry, as well as superstition : and could Charles, the lover of Agnes Sorel, with all the knights and nobles of France, look on while their champion, and a woman, was devoted to chains and death, without one effort to save her?

I marvel at my own versatility when I think how soon my quick spirits were excited by this gay, gaudy, noisy, idle place. The different appear ance of streets of London and Paris is the first thing to strike a stranger. In the gayest and most crowded streets of London the peo ple move steadily and rapidly along, with a grave collected air, as if all had some business in view; here, as a little girl observed the other day, all the people walk about ' ' like ladies and gentlemen going a visit ing :\" the women well-dressed and smiling, and with a certain jaunty air, trip along with their peculiar miitcing step, and appear as if their sole object was but to show themselves; the men ill-dressed, slovenly, and in general ill-looking, lounge indolently, and stare as if they had no other purpose in life but to look about them.* July 12. \u2014 \" Quel est a Paris le supreme talent? celui d'amuser : et quel est le supreme bonheur? l'amusement.\" Then le supreme lonheur may be found every evening from nine to ten, in a walk along the Boulevards, or a ramble through the Champs Elysees, and from ten to twelve in a salon at Tortoni's. What an extraordinary scene was lhat I witnessed to-night ! how truly French ! Spite of myself and all my melancholy musings, and all my philosophic allowances for the difference of national character, I was irresistibly compelled to smile at some of the farcical groups we encountered. In the most crowded parts of the Champs Elysees this evening (Sunday), there sat an old lady with a wrinkled yellow face and sharp features, dressed in flounced gown of dirty white muslin, a pink sash and a Leghorn hat and feathers. In one hand she held a small tray for the contribution of amateurs, and in Ihe other an Italian bravura, which she sung or rather screamed out wilh a thousand inde scribable shruggings, contortions, and grimaces, and in a voice to which a cracked tea-kettle, or a \"brazen candlestick turned,\" had 9eemed the music of the spheres. A little farther on we found two elderly gentlemen playing at see-saw ; one an immense corpulent man of fifteen stone at least, the other a thin dwarfish animal with gray muslachios, who held before him what I thought was a child, but on approaching, it proved to be a large stone strapped before him, to render his weight a counterpoise to that of his huge companion. We * It must not be forgotten that this was written ten years ago : the aspect of Paris is much changed since then. 1 \""], [16, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 4 passed on, and returning about half an hour afterwards down the same walk, we found the same venerable pair pursuing their edifying amusement with as much enthusiasm as before. Before the revolution, sacrilege became one of the most frequent crimes. I was told of a man who, having stolen from a church the silver box containing the consecrated wafers, returned the wafers next day in a letter to the Cure of the Parish, having used one of them to seal his envelop. * * * * July 27. \u2014 A conversation with S** ahvays leaves me sad. Can it then be possible that he is right? No \u2014 0 no! my understanding re jects the idea wilh indignation, my whole heart recoils from it ; yet if it should be so ! what then : have I been till now the dupe and the victim of factitious feelings? virtue, honour, seeling, generosity, you are then but words, signifying nolhing ? Yet if this vain philosophy lead to happiness, would not S** be happy? it is evident he is not. When he said that the object existed not in this world which could lead him twenty yards out of his way, did this sound like happiness? I re member that while he spoke, instead of feeling either persuaded or convinced by his captivating eloquence, I was perplexed and distressed; I suffered a painful compassion, and tear;, were in my eyes. I, who so often have pitied myself, pitied him at that moment a thousand times more ; I thought, I would not buy tranquillity at such a price as he has paid for it. Yet if he should be right? that if, which every now and then suggests itself, is terrible ; it shakes me in the utmost recesses of my heart. S* .*, in spite of myself, and in spite of all that with most perverted pains he has made himself (so different from what he once was), can charm and interest, pain and perplex me: \u2014 not so D**, another disciple of the same school : he inspires me with the strongest anti pathy I ever felt for a human being. Insignificant and disagreeable in his appearance, he looks as if all the bile under heaven had found its way into his complexion, and all the infernal irony of a Mephisto pheles into his turned-up nose and insolent curled lip. He is he says he is, an atheist, a materialist, a sensualist : the pains he takes to deprave and degrade his nature, render him so disgusting, (hat I could not even speak in his presence; I dreaded lest he should enter into conversation with me. I might have spared myself the fear. He piques himself on his utter contempt for, and disregard of, women \u2022 and, after all, is not himself worthy these words I bestow on him. * * * * Aug. 25.\u2014 Here begins, I hope, a new \u00e6ra.

Contrary to my own wishes, and to the expectations of others, I live: and trusting in God that I have been preserved for some wise and good purpose, am therefore thankful : even supposing I should be reserved for new trials, I cannot surely in this world suffer more than I have suifered : it is not possible that the same causes can be again combined to afflict me. How truly can I say, few and evil have my days been ! may I not say as truly, I have not weakly yielded, I have not \"gone about to cause my heart to despair,\" but have striven, and not in vain ? I took the remedies they gave me, and was grateful ; I resigned myself to live, when had I but willed it, I might have died ; and when to die and be at rest, seemed to my sick heart the only covetable boon. Sept. 3. \u2014 A terrible anniversary at Paris \u2014 still ill and very weak. Edmonde came, pour me desennuyer. He has soul enough to bear a good deal of wearing down ; but whether the sine qualities he possesses will turn to good or evil, is hard lo tell : it is evident his character has not yet settled : it vibrates still as nature inclines him to good, and all the circumstances around him to evil. We talked as usual of women, of gallantry, of the French and English character, of national prejudices, of Shakspeare and Bacine (never sailing subjects of dis cussion), and he read aloud Delille's Calacomhes de Borne, wilh great feeling, animation, and dramatic effect. La mode at Paris is a spell of wondrous power : it is most like what we should call in England a rage, a mania, a torrent sweeping down the bounds between good and evil, sense and nonsense, upon whose surface straws and egg-shells float inlo notoriety, while the gold and the marble are buried and hidden till its force be spent. The rage for cashmeres and little dogs has lately given way to a rage for Le Solitaire, a romance written, I believe, by a certain Vicomte d'Arlin- court. Le Solitaire rules the imagination, the taste, the dress of half Paris : if you go to the theatre, it is to see the \"Solitaire,\" either as tragedy, opera, or melodrame; the men dress their hair and Ihrow their cloaks about them a la Solitaire ; bonnets and caps, flounces and ribbons, are all a let Solitaire ; the print shops are full of scenes from Le Solitaire; it is on every toilette, on every work-table; \u2014 ladies carry it about in their reticules to show each other lhat they are a la mode ; and the men \u2014 what can they do but humble their under standings and be extasies, when beautiful eyes sparkle in ils defence and glisten in its praise, and ruby lips pronounce it divine, delicious; \" quelle sublimite dans les descriptions, quelle force dans les carac leres 1 quelle ame I feu! chaleur ! verve! originalile! passion!\" etc. \"Vous n'avez pas lu le Solitaire?\" said Madame M. yesterday. \"Eh mon dieu! il est done possible ! vous? mais, ma chere, vous eles perdue de repulalion, et pour jamais !\""], [18, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 6 To retrieve my lost reputation, I sat down to read Le Solitaire, and as I read my amazement grew, and I did in ' ' gaping wonderment abound,\" to think that fashion, like the insane root of old, had power to drive a whole city mad with nonsense ; for such a tissue of abomi nable absurdities, bombast and blasphemy, bad taste and bad language, was never surely indited by any madman, in or out of Bedlam : not Maturin himself, that king of fustian, \" ever wrote or borrowed Any thing half so horrid !\" and this is the book which has turned the brains of half Paris, which has gone through fifteen editions in a few weeks, which not to admire is \"pitoyable,\" and not to have read \"quelque chose d'inouie.\" The objects at Paris which have most struck me, have been those least vaunted. The view of the city from the Pont des Arts, to-night, enchanted me. As every body who goes to Rome views the Coliseum by moon light, so nobody should leave Paris wilhout seeing the effect from the Pont des Arts, on a fine moonlight night : \u2014 \" Earth hath not any thing to show more fair.\" It is singular I should have felt its influence at such a moment : it appears to me lhat those who, from feeling too strongly, have learnt to consider too deeply, become less sensible to the works of art, and more alive to nature. Are there not times when we turn with indif ference from the finest picture or statue \u2014 Ihe most improving book \u2014 the most amusing poem ; and when the very commonest, and every day beauties of nature, a soft evening, a lovely landscape, the moon riding in her glory through a clouded sky, without forcing or asking attention, sink into our hearts? They do not console, \u2014 they some times add poignancy to pain ; but still they have a power, and do not speak in vain : they become a part of us; and never are we so in clined to claim kindred with nature, as when sorrow has lent us her mournful experience. At the time I felt this (and how many have felt it as deeply, and expressed it better 1) I did not think it, still less could I have said it; but I have pleasure in recording the past impression. \" On rend mieux compte de ce qu'on a senti que de ce qu'on sent.\" September 8. \u2014 Paris is crowded with English ; and I do not wonder at it; it is, on the whole, a pleasant place to live in. I like Paris though I shall quit it without regret as soon as I have strength to travel. Here the social arts are carried to perfection \u2014 above all the art of conversation : every one talks much and talks well. In this"], [19, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 7 multiplicity of words it must happen of course that a certain quantum of ideas is intermixed : and somehow or other, by dint of listening, talking, and looking about them, people do learn, and information to a certain point is general. Those who have knowledge are not shy of imparting it, and those who are ignorant take care not to seem so ; but are sometimes agreeable, often amusing, and seldom betes. Nowhere have I seen unformed sheepish boys, nowhere the surliness, awkward ness, ungraciousness, and uneasy proud bashfulness, I have seen in the best companies in England. Our French friend Lucien has, at fifteen, the air and conversation of a finished gentleman ; and our English friend C is at eighteen, the veriest log of a lumpish school-boy that ever entered a room. What I have seen of society, I like : the delicious climate too, the rich skies, the clear elastic at mosphere, the out of doors life the people lead, are all (in summer at least) delightful. There may be less comfort here ; but nobody feels the want of it ; and there is certainly more amusement \u2014 -and amuse ment is here truly \" le supreme bonheur.\" Happiness, according to the French meaning of the word, lies more on the surface of life : it is a sort of happiness which is cheap and ever at hand. This is the place to live in for the merry poor man, or the melancholy rich one : for those who, have too much money, and those who have too little ; for those who only wish, like the Irishman \" to live all the days of their life,\" \u2014 prendre en le'gere monnaie la somme des plaisirs : but to the thinking, the seeling, the domestic man, who only exists, enjoys, suffers through his affections \u2014 \" Who is retired as noontide dew, Or fountain in a noonday grove \u2014 ' to such a one, Paris must be nothing better than a vast frippery shop, an ever-varying galantee show, an eternal vanity fair, a vortex of folly, a pandemonium of vice. September 18. \u2014 Our imperials are packed, our passports signed, and we set off to-morrow for Geneva by Dijon and the Jura. I leave no thing behind me to regret, I see nothing before me to fear, and have no hope but in change ; and now all that remains to be said of Paris, and all its wonders and all its vanities, all its glories and all its gaieties, are they not recorded in the ponderous chronicles of most veracious tourists, and what can I add thereto ! Geneva, Saturday Night, 11 oclock. \u2014 Can it be the \"blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone\" I hear from my window? Shall I hear it to morrow, when I wake ? Have I seen, have I felt the reality of what I have so often imagined ? and much, much more?

To me they are nothing : I have in"], [20, "8 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. a sew hours stored my mind with images of beauty and grandeur which will last through my whole existence. a* * * * * Yet I know I am not singular ; others have felt the same : others, who, capable of \" drinking in the soul of things,\" have viewed nature less with their eyes than their hearts. Now I feel the value of my own enthusiasm ; now am I repaid in part for many pains and sorrows and errors it has cost me. Though the natural expression of lhat enthusi asm be now repressed and restrained, and my spirits subdued by long illness, what but enthusiasm could elevate my mind to a level with the sublime objects round me, and excite me to pour out my whole heart in admiration as I do now ! How deeply they have penetrated into my imagination 1 \u2014 Beautiful nature ! If I could but infuse into you a portion of my own existence as you have become a part of mine \u2014 If I could but bid you reflect back my soul, as it reflects back all your mag nificence, I would make you my only friend, and wish no other; con tent \" to love earth only for its earthly sake.\" I am so tired to-night, I can say nothing ofthe Jura, nor ofthe su perb ascent of the mountain, tome so novel, so astonishing a scene; nor \u25a0of the cheerful brilliance of the morning sun, illuminating the high cliffs, and throwing the deep woody vallies into the darkest sha dow ; nor of the far distant plains of France seen between the hills, and melting away into a soft vapoury light ; nor of Morey, and its deli cious strawberries and honey-comb; nor of that never-to-be-forgotten moment, when turning the corner of the road, as it wound round a cliff near the summit, we beheld the lake and city of Geneva spread al our feet, with its magnificent back-ground of the Italian Alps, peak be yond peak, snow-crowned! and Mont Blanc towering over all ! No description had prepared me for this prospect ; and the first impression was rapturous surprise ; but by degrees the vastness and the huge gi gantic features of the scene pressed like a weight upon \" my amazed sprite,\" and the feeling of its immense extent fatigued my imagination till my spirits gave way in tears. Then came remembrances of those I ought to forget, blending with all I saw a deeper power \u2014 raising up emotions, long buried though not dead, to fright me with their resur rection. I was so glad lo arrive here, and shall be so glad to sleep even tho dull sleep which laudanum brings me. Oct. 1. \u2014 When next I submit (having the power to avoid it) to be crammed into a carriage and carried from place to place, whether I would or not, and be set down at the stated points de vue, while a detestable laquais points out what I am to admire, I shall deserve to endure again what I endured to-day. As there was no possibility of relief, I resigned myself to my fate, and was even amused by the ab surdity of my own situation. We went to see the junction ofthe \\rve"], [21, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 9 and the Rhone : or rather to see the Arve pollute the rich, blue trans parent Rhone, with its turbid waters. The day was heavy, and the .louds rolled in prodigious masses along the dark sides of the moun- ains, frequently hiding them from our view, and substituting for their graceful outlines and ever-varying contrast of tint and shade, an im penetrable veil of dark gray vapour. 3rd. \u2014 We took a boat and rowed on the lake for about two hours. Our boatman, a sine handsome athletic figure, was very talkative and intelligent. He had been in the service of Lord Byron, and was with him in that storm between La Meillerie and St. Gingough, which is described in the third canto of Childe Harold. He pointed out among the beautiful villas, which adorn the banks on either side, that in which the empress Josephine had resided for six months, not long before her death. When he spoke of her, he rested upon his oars to descant upon her virtues, her generosity, her affability, her goodness to the poor, and his countenance became quite animated with enthusiasm. Here, in France, wherever the name of Josephine is mentioned, there seems to exist but one feeling, one opinion of her beneficence and amabilite of character. Our boatman had also rowed Marie Louise across the lake, on her way to Paris : he gave us no very captivating picture of her. He described her as \"grande, blonde, bien suite et e xtre me ment fier e :\" and told us how she tormented her ladies in waiting; \" comme elle tracassait ses dames d'honneur.\" The day being rainy and gloomy, her attendants begged of her to defer the passage for a short time, till the fogs had cleared away, and discovered all the beauty of the sur rounding shores. She replied haughtily and angrily, \" Je veux faire ce que je veux \u2014 allez toujours.\" M. le Baron M n, whom we knew at Paris, told me several de lightful anecdotes of Josephine : he was attached to her household, and high in her confidence. Napoleon sent him on the very morning of his second nuptials, with a message and billet to the ex-empress. On hearing that the ceremony was performed which had passed her sceptre into the hands of the proud, cold-hearted Austrian, the feelings of the ivoman overcame every other. She burst into tears, and wringing her hands, exclaimed \"Ah! au moins, qu'il soit heureux!\" Napoleon resigned this estimable and amiable creature to narrow views of selfish policy, and with her his good genius fled : he deserved it, and verily he hath had his reward. We drove after dinner to Copet; and the Duchesse de Broglie being absent, had an opportunity of seeing the chateau. All things \" were there of her\" \u2014 of her, whose genuine worth excused, whose all-com manding talents threw into shade, those sailings which belonged to (he weakness of her sex, and her warm feelings and imagination. The servant girl who showed us the apartments, had been fifteen years in"], [22, "10 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. Madame de Stael's service. All the servants had remained long in the family, \" elle etait si bonne et si charmante maitresse!\" A picture of Madame de Stael when young, gave me the idea of a fine countenance and figure, though the features were irregular. In the bust, the ex pression is not so prepossessing : \u2014 there the colour and brilliance of her splendid dark eyes, the finest feature of her face, are of course quite lost. The bust of M. Rocca* was standing in the Baron de Stael's dressing-room : I was more struck wilh it than any thing I saw, not only as a chef-d'oeuvre, but from the perfect and regular beauty of the head, and the charm of the expression. It was just such a mouth as we might suppose to have uttered his well-known reply \u2014 \" Jel'aime rai tellement qu'elle finira par m'aimer.\" Madame de Stael had a son by this marriage, who had just been brought home by his brother, the Baron, from a school in the neighbourhood. He is about seven years old. If we may believe the servant, Madame de Stael did not ac knowledge this son till just before her death ; and she described the wonder of the boy on being brought home to the chateau, and desired to call Monsieur le Baron \"Mon frere\" and \" Auguste.\" This part of Madame de Stael's conduct seems incomprehensible ; but her death is recent, the circumstances little known, and it is difficult to judge her motives. As a woman, as a wife, she might not have been able to brave \" the world's dread laugh\" \u2014 but as a mother ? We have also seen Ferney \u2014 a place which did not interest me much, for I have no sympathies with Voltaire : \u2014 and some other beautiful scenes in the neighbourhood. The Panorama exhibited in London just before I left it, is wonder fully correct, with one pardonable exception : the artist did not venture to make the waters of the lake of the intense ultramarine tinged wilh violet as I now see them before me ; \" So darkly, deeply, beautifully blue ;\" it would have shocked English eyes as an exaggeration, or rather im possibility.

I suffer now so constantly, that a day tolerably free from pain seems a blessing for which I can scarce be sufficiently thankful. Such was yesterday. Our road layalong the south bank of the lake, through Evian, Tho non, St. Gingough : and on the opposite shores we had in view succes sively, Lausanne, Vevai, Clarens,andChillon. Arain storm pursued, or almost surrounded us the whole morning ; but we had the good fortune to escape it. We travelled faster than it could pursue, and it seemed to retire before us as we approached. The effect was surprisingly beautiful ; for while the two extremities of the lake were discoloured and enveloped in gloom, that part opposite to us was as blue and trans parent as heaven itself, and almost as bright. Over Vevai, as we viewed it from La Meillerie, rested one end of a glorious rainbow : the olher extremity appeared to touch the bosom of the lake, and shone vividly against the dark mountains above Chillon.

I must note a few of the objects which struck me to-day and yesterday, that I may at will combine them hereafter to my mind's eye, and recall ihe glorious pictures I beheld, as we tra velled through the Vallais to Brig : the swollen and turbid (no longer \" blue and arrowy\") Rhone, rushing and roaring along ; the gigantic mountains in all their endless variety of fantastic forms, which enclosed us round, \u2014 their summits now robed in curling clouds, and then, as the winds swept them aside, glittering in the sunshine ; the little vil lages perched like eagles' nests on the cliffs, far, far above our heads ; the deep rocky channels through which the torrents had madly broken a way, tearing through every obstacle till they reached the Rhone, and marking their course with devastation ; the scene of direful ruin at Martigny; the cataracts gushing, bounding from the living rock and plunging inlo some unseen abyss below; even the shrubs and the fruit trees which in the wider parts of the valley bordered the road side ; the vines, the rich scarlet barberries, the apples and pears which we might have gathered by extending our hands; \u2014 all and each, when I recall them, will rise up a vivid picture before my own fancy; \u2014 but never could be truly represented to the mind of another \u2014 at least through the medium of words. And yet, with all its wonders and beauties, this day's journey has not enchanted me like Saturday's. The scenery then had a different species of beauty, a deeper interest \u2014 when the dark blue sky was above our heads, and the transparent lake shone another heaven at our feet, and the recollection of great and glorious names, and visions of poetic fancy, and ideal forms more lovely lhan ever trod this earth, hovered around us : \u2014 and then those thoughts which would intrude \u2014 remembrances of the far-off absent, who are or have been loved, min gled with the whole, and shed an imaginary splendour or a tender in terest, over scenes which required no extraneous powers to enhance their native loveliness. \u2014 no charm borrowed from imagination to em bellish the all-beautiful reality. Duomo d'Ossola. \u2014 AVhat shall I [say of the marvellous, the mira culous Simplon ? Nothing : every body has said already every thing that can be said and exclaimed. In our descent, as the valley widened, and the stern terrific features of the scene assumed a gentler character, we came to the beautiful village of Davedro, with ils cottages and vineyards spread over a green"], [25, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 13 slope, between the mountains and the torrent below. This lovely nook struck me the more from its contrast with the region of snows, clouds, and barren rocks to which our eyes had been for several hours accustomed. In such a spot as Davedro I fancied I should wish to live, could I in life assemble round me all that my craving heart and boundless spirit desire; \u2014 or die, when life had exhausted all excite ment, and the subdued and weary soul had learned to be content with repose : \u2014 but not not till then. We are now in Italy ; but have not yet heard the soft sounds of the Italian language. However, we read with great satisfaction the Ita lian denomination of our Inn, \"La grande Alberga della Villa\" \u2014 called out \" Cameriere (\"instead of \" Garcon !\" \u2014 plucked ripe grapes as they hung from the treillages above our heads \u2014 gathered green figs from the trees, bursting and luscious \u2014 panted with the intense heat \u2014 intense and overpowering from its contrast with the cold of the Alpine regions we had just left \u2014 and fancied we began lo feel \" cette vie enivrante, Que le soleii du sud inspire a tous les sens.\" -a- - ' 11 dt night. \u2014 Fatigue and excitement have lately proved too much for me : but I will not sink. I will yet bear up ; and when a day thus passed amid scenes like those of a romance, amid all that would once nave charmed my imagination, and enchanted my senses, brings no real pleasure, but is ended, as now it ends, in tears, in bitterness of heart, in languor, in sickness, and in pain \u2014 ah ! let me remember the lesson of resignation I have lately learned ; and by elevating my thoughts to a better world, turn to look upon the miserable affections which have agitated me here as * Could I but become as insensible, as regardless of the painful past as I am of the all lovely present !

Imagine la divine Julie trip ping up and down the artificial terraces of the Isola Bella, among flower pots and statues, and colonnades and grottos; and St. Preux sighing towards her, from some trim fantastic wilderness in the Isola Mad re ! The day was heavenly, and I shall never forget the sunset, as we viewed it reflected in the lake, which appeared at one moment an ex panse of living fire. This is the first we have seen of those effulgent sunsets with which Italy will make us familiar. Milan. \u2014 Our journey yesterday, through the flat fertile plains of Lombardy, was not very interesting ; and the want of novelty and excitement made it fatiguing, in spite of the matchless roads and the celerity with which we travelled. Whatever we may think of Napoleon in England, it is impossible to travel on the Continent, and more particularly through Lombardy, without being struck with the magnificence and vastness of his public works \u2014 either designed or executed. He is more regretted here than in France ; or ralher he has not been so soon banished from men's minds. In Italy he followed the rational policy of depressing the nobles, and providing occupation and amusement for the lower classes. I spoke to-day with an intelligent artisan, who pointed out to us a hall built near the public walk by Napoleon, for the people to dance and assemble in, when the weather was unfavourable. The man con cluded some very animated and sensible remarks on the late events, by adding expressively, that though many had been benefited by the change, there was to him and all others of his class as much differ ence between the late reign and the present, as between Voret le fer. The silver shrine of St. Carlo Borromeo, with all its dazzling waste of magnificence, struck me with a feeling of melancholy and indigna tion. The gems and gold which lend such a horrible splendour to corruption; the skeleton head, grinning ghastly under its invaluable coronet ; the skeleton hand supporting a crozier glittering with dia monds, appeared so frightful, so senseless a mockery of the excellent, simple-minded, and benevolent being they were intended to honour, that I could but wonder, and escape from the sight as quickly as pos sible. The Duomo is on the whole more remarkable for the splendour of the material, than the good taste with which it is employed : the statues which adorn it inside and out, are sufficient of themselves to form a very respectable congregation : they are four thousand in number. 9th, Tuesday. \u2014 We gave the morning to the churches, and the evening to the Ambrosian library. The day was, on the whole, more fatiguing than edifying or amusing. I remarked whatever was re markable, admired all that is usually admired, but brought away few"], [27, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 15 impressions of novelty or pleasure. The objects which prin cipally struck my capricious and fastidious fancy, were precisely those which passed unnoticed by every one else, and are not worth recording. In the first church we visited, I saw a young girl respect ably and even elegantly dressed, in the beautiful costume ofthe Milan ese, who was kneeling on the pavement before a crucifix, weeping bit terly, and at the same time fanning herself most vehemently with a large green fan. Another church (St. Alessandro, I think) was oddly de corated for a christian temple. A statue of Venus stood on one side of the porch, a statue of Hercules on the other. The two divinities, whose attributes could not be mistaken, had been converted from hea thenism into two very respectable saints. I forget their christian names. Nor is this the most amusing metamorphosis I have seen here. The transformation of two heathen divinities into saints, is matched by the apotheosis of two modern sovereigns into pagan dei ties. On the frieze of the salle, adjoining the amphitheatre, there is a head of Napoleon, which, by the addition of a beard, has been con verted into a Jupiter ; and on the opposite side, a head of Josephine, which, being already beautiful and dignified, has required no alteration, except in name, to become a creditable Minerva. lO/A. \u2014 At the Brera, now called the \"Palace of the Arts and Sciences,\" we spent some delightful hours. There is a numerous collection of pictures by Titian, Guido, Albano, Schidone, the three Carraccis, Tintoretto, Giorgione, etc. Some old paintings in fresco, by Luini and others of his age, were especially pointed out to us, which had been cut from the walls of churches now destroyed. They are preserved here, I presume, as curiosities, and specimens of the pro gress of the arts, for they possess no other merit \u2014 none, at least, that I could discover. Here is the \" Marriage of the Virgin,\" by Raffaelle, of which I had often heard. It disappointed me at the first glance, but charmed me at the second, and enchanted me at the third. The unobtrusive grace and simplicity of Raffaelle do not immediately strike an eye so unpractised, and a taste so unformed as mine still is : for though I have seen the best pictures in England, we have there no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the two divinest masters of the Italian art, Raffaelle and Correggio. There are not, I conceive, half a dozen of either in all the collections together, and those we do pos sess, are far from being among their best efforts. But Raffaelle must not make me forget the Hagar in the Brera : the affecting \u2014 the inimitable Hagar! what agony, what upbraiding, what love, what helpless deso lation of heart in that countenance ! I may well remember the deep pathos of this picture ; for the face of Hagar has haunted me sleeping and waking ever since I beheld it. Marvellous power of art I that mere inanimate forms, and colours compounded of gross maferials,"], [28, "16 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. should thus live\u2014 thus speak\u2014 thus stand a soul-felt presence before us, and from the senseless board or canvas, breathe into our hearts a seeling, beyond what the most impassioned eloquence could ever in spire \u2014 beyond what mere words can ever render. Last night and the preceding we spent at the Scala. The opera was stupid, and Madame Bellochi , who is the present primadonna, appeared to me harsh and ungraceful, when compared to Fodor. The new ballet however, amply indemnified us for the disappointment. Our Italian friends condoled wilh us on being a few days too late to see La Vestale, which had been performed for sixty nights, and is one of Vigano's masterpieces. I thought the Didone Allandonata left us nothing to regret. The immense size of the stage, the splendid scenery, the classical propriety and magnificence of the dresses, the fine music, and the exquisite acting (for there is very little dancing), all conspired to render it enchanting. The celebrated cavern scene in the fourth book of Virgil, is rather too closely copied in a most inimitable pas dedeux ; so closely, indeed, lhat I was considerably alarmed pour les lienseances ; but little Ascanius, who is asleep in a corner (Heaven knows how he came there), wakes at the critical moment, and the impending catastrophe is averted. Such a scene, however beautiful, would not, I think, be endured on the English stage. I observed that when it began, the curtains in front of the boxes were withdrawn, the whole audience, who seemed to be expecting it, was hushed; the deepest silence, the most delighted attention prevailed during its per formance ; and the moment it was over, a third of the spectators de parted. I am told this is always the case; and that in almost every ballet d 'action, the public are gratified by a scene, or scenes, ofa simi lar tendency. The second time I saw the Didone, my attention, in spile of the fascination of the scene, was attracted towards a box near us, which was occupied by a noble English family just arrived at Milan. In the front of the box sat a beautiful girl apparently not fifteen, with laughing lips and dimpled cheeks, the very personification of blooming, innocent, English loveliness. I watched her (I could not help it, when my interest was once awakened) through the whole scene. I marked her increased agitation : I saw her cheeks flush, her eyes glisten, her bosom flutter, asif with sighs I could not overhear, till a.length, over powered with emotion, she turned away her head, and covered her eyes with her hand. Mothers 1 \u2014 English mothers ! who bring your daughters abroad to finish their education\u2014 do you well to expose them to scenes like these, anA force the young bud of early seeling in such a precious hot-bed as this ? Can a finer finger on the piano, \u2014 a finer taste in painting, or any possible improvement in foreign arts and foreign graces, compensate for one taint on lhat moral purity, which has ever"], [29, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 17 been (and may it ever be !) the boast, the charm of Englishwomen ? But what have I to do wilh all this? \u2014 I came here lo be amused and to forget ; \u2014 not to moralize or to criticise. Vigano, who is lately dead, composed the Didone Abbandonata as well as La Vestale, Otello, Nina, and others. All his ballets are cele brated for their classical beauty and interest. This man, though but a dancing-master, must have had the soul ofa painter, a musician, and a poet in one. He must have been a perfect master of design, group ing, contrast, picturesque, and scenic effect. He must have had the most exquisite feeling for musical expression, to adapt it so admirably to his purposes ; and those gestures and movements with which he has so gracefully combined it, and which address themselves but too pow erfully to the senses and the imagination \u2014 what are they, but the very \" poelry of motion,\" la poe'sie mise en action, rendering words a superfluous and feeble medium in comparison ? I saw at the Mint yesterday the medal struck in honour of Vigano, bearing his head on one side, and on the other, Prometheus chained ; to commemorate his famous ballet of that name. One of these medals, struck in gold, was presented to him in the name of the government : \u2014 a singular distinction for a dancing-master ; \u2014 but Vigano was a dancing-master of genius ; and this is the land, where genius in every shape is deified. The enchanting music of the Prometteo by Beethoven, is well known in England, but to produce the ballet on our stage, as it was exhibited here, would be impossible. The entire tribe of our dancers and figu rantes, wilh their jumpings, swirlings, quiverings, and pirouettings, must be first annihilated ; and Vigano, or Didelot, or Noverre rise again to inform the whole corps de ballet with another soul and the whole audience wilh another spirit : \u2014 for \u2014 \" Poiche paga il volgo sciocco, h giusto Scioccamente 'bailor' per dargli gusto.\" The Theatre of the Scala, notwithstanding the vastness of my ex pectations, did not disappoint me. I heard it criticised as being dark and gloomy; for only the stage is illuminated : but when I remember how often I have left our English theatres with dazzled eyes and aching head, \u2014 distracted by the multiplicity of objects and faces, and \" blasted with excess of light,\" \u2014 I feel reconciled to this peculiarity; more especially as it heightens beyond measure the splendour of the stage effect. We have the Countess Bubna's box while we are here. She scarce ly ever goes herself, being obliged to hold a sort of military drawing room almost every evening. Her husband, General Bubna, has the"], [30, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 18 command of the Austrian forces in the north of Italy : and though the Archduke Reinier is nominal viceroy, all real power seems lodged in Bubna's bands. He it was who suppressed the insurrection in Pied mont during the last struggle for liberty : 'twas his vocation \u2014 more the pity. Eight hundred ofthe Milanese, at the head of them Count Melzi, were connected with the Carbonari and the Piedmoutese insur gents. On Count Bubna's return from his expedition, a list of these malcontents being sent to him by the police, he refused even to look at it, and merely saying that it was the business of the police to surveiller those persons, but he must be allowed to be ignorant of their names, publicly tore the paper. The same night he visited the theatre, ac companied by Count Melzi, was received wilh acclamations, and has since been deservedly popular. Bubna is a heavy gross-looking man, a victim to the gout, and with nothing martial or captivating in his exterior. He has talents, how ever, and those not only of a military cast. He was generally em ployed to arrange the affairs ofthe Emperor of Austria with Napoleon. His loyalty to his own sovereign, and the soldier-like frankness and integrity of his character, gained him the esteem of the French em peror ; who, when any difficulties occurred in their arrangements, used to say impatiently \u2014 \"Envoyez-moi done Bubna!\" The count is of an illustrious family of Alsace, which removed to Bohemia when that province was ceded to France. He had nearly ruined himself by gambling, when the emperor (so it is said) advised him, or, in other words, commanded him to marry the daughter of one Arnvelt or Arnfeldt, a baptized Jew, who had been servant to a Jewish banker at Vienna ; and on his death left a million of florins to each of his daughters. He was a man of the lowest extraction, and without auy education ; but having sense enough to feel its advantages, he gave a most brilliant one to his daughters. The Countess Bubna is an elegant, an accomplished, and has the character of being also an amiable woman. She is here a person of the very first consequence, the wife of the archduke alone taking precedence of her. A propos of the viceroy, when on the Corso to-day with the Countess Bubna, we met him with the vice-queen, as she is styled, here, walking in pub lic. The archduke has not (as the countess observed) la plus jolie tournure du monde : his appearance is heavy, awkward, and slovenly, wilh more than the usual Austrian stupidity of countenance : a com plete testa tedesca. His beautiful wife, the Princess Maria of Savoy, to whom he has been married only a few months, held his arm; and as she moved a little in front, seemed to drag him after her like a mere appendage to her state. I gazed after them, amused by the contrast : he looking like a dull, stiff, old bachelor, the very figure of Moody in"], [31, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. ' 19 the Country Girl ; \u2014 she, an elegant, sprightly, captivating creature ; decision in her step, laughter on her lips, and pride, intelligence, and mischief in her brilliant eyes. * * * * * We visited yesterday the military college, sounded by the viceroy, Eugene Beauharnois, for the children of soldiers who had fallen in battle. The original design is now altered ; and it has become a mere public school, to which any boys may be admitted, paying a certain sum a year. We went over the whole building, and afterwards saw the scholars, two hundred and eighty in number, sit down to dinner. Every thing appeared nice, clean, and admirably ordered. At the Mint, which interested me extremely, we found them coining silver crowns for the Levant trade, with the head of Maria Theresa, and the date 1780. We were also shown the beautifully engraved die for the medal which the university of Padua presented to Belzoni. The evening was spent at the Teatro Re, where we saw a bad senti mental comedy (una Commedia di Carattere) exceedingly well acted. One actor I thought almost equal to Dowton*in his own style; \u2014 we had afterwards some fine music. Some of (he Milanese airs, which the itinerant musicians give us, have considerable beauty and character. There is less monotony, I think, in their general style than in the Venetian music ; and perhaps less sentiment, less softness. When left alone to-night, to do penance on the sofa, for my late walks, and re cruit for our journey to-morrow, \u2014 I tried to adapt English verses to one or two very pretty airs which Annoni brought me to-day, with out the Italian words ; but it is a most difficult and invidious task. Even Moore, with his unequalled command over the lyric harmonies of our language, cannot perfectly satisfy ears accustomed to the \" Linked sweetness long drawn out\" of the Italian vowels, combined with musical sounds : fancy such dissonant syllables as ex, pray, what, breaks, strength, uttered in minim time, hissing and grating through half a bar, instead of the dulcet anima mia, Catina amalile \u2014 Caro mio tesoro, etc. STANZAS FOR MUSIC.

We left Milan two days ago, and arrived early the same day at Brescia ; there is, I believe, very little to see there, and of that little, I saw nothing, \u2014 being too ill and too low for the slightest exertion. The only pleasurable feeling I can remember was excited by our ap proach lo the Alps, after traversing the flat, fertile, uninteresting plains of Lombardy. The peculiar sensation of elevation and delight, in spired by mountain scenery, can only be understood by those who have felt it : at least I never had formed an idea of it till I found my self ascending the Jura. But Brescia ought to Be immortalized in the history of our travels : for there, stalking down the Corso \u2014 le nez en fair \u2014 we met our ac quaintance L \u2014 \u2014 , from whom we had parted last on the pave of Pic cadilly. I remember lhat in London I used lo think him not remark able for wisdom, \u2014 and his travels have infinitely improved him \u2014 in folly. He boasted to us triumphantly that he had run over sixteen thousand miles in sixteen months : that he had bowed at the levee of the Emperor Alexander, \u2014 been slapped on the shoulder by the Arch duke Constantine, \u2014 shaken hands with a Lapland witch, \u2014 and been presented in full volunteer uniform at every court between Stockholm and Milan. Yet is he not one particle wiser than if he had spent the same time in walking up and down the Strand. He has contrived, however, to pick up on his tour, strange odds and ends of foreign follies, which stick upon the coarse-grained materials of his own John Bull character like tinfoil upon sackcloth : so that I see little difference between what he was, and what he is, except that from a simple goose , \u2014 he has become a compound one. With all this, L is not un bearable \u2014 not yet at least. He amuses others as a butt \u2014 and me as a specimen of a new genus of fools : for his folly is not like any thing one usually meets with. It is not, par exemple, the folly of stupidity, for he talks much ; nor of dullness, for he laughs much ; nor of igno rance, for he has seen much ; nor of wrong-headedness, for he can be guided right ; nor of bad-heartedness, for he is good-natured ; nor of thoughtlessness, for he is prudent ; nor of extravagance, for he can calculate even lo the value of half a lira : but it is an essence of folly, peculiar to himself, and like Monsieur Jacques's melancholy, \" com pounded of many simples, extracted from various objects, and the"], [33, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 21 sundry contemplation of his travels.\" So much, for the present, of our friend L . We left Brescia early yesterday morning, and after passing Desen zano, came in sight of the Lago di Garda. I had from early associa tions a delightful impression of the beauty of this lake, and it did not disappoint me. It is far superior, I think, to the Lago Maggiore, because the scenery is more resserre, lies in a smaller compass, so that the eye takes in the separate features more easily. The mountains to the north are dark, broken, and wild in their forms, and their bases seemed to extend to the water edge : the hills to the south are smiling, beautiful, and cultivated, studded with white flat-roofed buildings, which glitter one above another in the sunshine. Our drive along the promontory of Sirmione, to visit the ruins of the Villa of Catullus, was delightful. The fresh breeze which ruffled the dark blue lake, revived my spirits, and chased away my head-ache. I was inclined to be en chanted with all I saw ; and when our guide took us into an old cellar choked with rubbish, and assured us gravely that it was the very spot in which Catullus had written his Odes to Lesbia. I did not laugh in his face ; for, after all, it would be as easy lo prove that it is, as that it is not. The old town and castle of Sirmio are singularly picturesque, whether viewed from above or below, and the grove of olives which crowned the steep extremity of the promontory, interested us, being the first we had seen in Italy : on the whole I fully enjoyed the early part of this day. At Peschiera, which is strongly fortified, we crossed the Mincio. \u2014 O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood, Smooth-flowing Mincius crowned with vocal reeds. Its waters were exquisitely transparent; but it was difficult tore member ils poetical pretensions, in sight of those odious barracks and batteries. The reeds mentioned by Virgil and Milton still flourish upon its banks, and I forgave them for spoiling in some degree the beauty of the shore, when I thought of Adelaide of Burgundy, who concealed herself among them for three days, when she fled from the dungeon of Peschiera lo the arms of her lover. I was glad I had read her story in Gibbon, since it enabled me to add to classical and poetical associations, an interest at once romantic and real. The rest to-morrow \u2014 for I can write no more. At Verona, Oct. 20. \u2014 I had just written the above when I was startled by a mournful strain from a chorus of voices, raised at intervals, and approaching gradually nearer. I walked to the window, and saw a long funeral procession just entering the church, which is opposite to the door of our inn. I immediately threw over me a veil and shawl, followed it, and stood by while the service was chaunled over the dead. The scene, as viewed by the light of about two hundred tapers, which"], [34, "22 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. were carried by the assistants, was as new to me as it was solemn and striking ; but it was succeeded by a strange and forlorn contrast. The moment the service was over, the tapers were suddenly extinguished ; the priests and the relatives all disappeared in an inconceivably short time, and before I was quite aware of what was going forward : the coffin, stripped of its embroidered pall and garlands of flowers, ap peared a mere chest of deal boards, roughly nailed together; and was left standing on tressels, bare, neglected, and forsaken in the middle of the church. I approached it almost fearfully, and with a deeper emotion than I believed such a thing could now excite within me. And here, thought I, rests the human being, who has lived and loved, suffered and enjoyed, and, if I may judge by the splendour of his funeral rites, has been honoured, served, flattered while living : \u2014and now not one remains to shed a last tear over the dead, but a single stranger, a wanderer from a land he perhaps knew not : to whom his very name is unknown ! And while thus I moralized, two sextons appeared ; and one of them seizing the miserable and deserted coffin, rudely and unceremoniously flung it on his shoulders, and vanished through a vaulted door ; and I returned to my room, to write this, and to think how much better, how much more humanely, we manage these things in our own England. Oct. 21. \u2014 Verona is a clean and quiet place, containing some fine edifices by Palladio and his pupils. The principal object of interest is the ancient amphitheatre ; the most perfect I believe in Italy. The inner circle, with all its ranges of seats, is entire. We ascended to the top, and looked down into the Piazza d'arme, where several bat talions of Austrian soldiers were exercising; their arms glittering splendidly in the morning sun. As I have now been long enough in Italy to sympathize in the national hatred of the Austrians, I turned from the sight, resolved not lo be pleased. The arena of the amphi theatre is smaller, and less oval in form than I had expected : and in the centre, there is a little paltry gaudy wooden theatre for puppets and tumblers, \u2014 forming a grotesque contrast to the massive and majes tic architecture around it : but even tumblers and puppets, as Rospo observed, are better than wild beasts and ferocious gladiators. There are also at Verona a triumphal arch to the Emperor Galli enus ; the architecture and inscription almost as perfect as if erected yesterday; \u2014 and a most singular bridge of three irregular arches, built, I believe, by the Scaligieri family, who were once princes of Verona. It is well known that the story of Romeo and Juliet is here regarded as a traditionary and indisputable fact, and the tomb of Juliet is shown in a garden near the town. So much has been written and said on Ihis subject, I can add only one observation To the reality of (he"], [35, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 23 story it has been objected that the oldest narrator, Masuccio, relates it as having happened at Sienna : but might he not have heard the tradi tion at Verona, and transferred the scene to Sienna, since he repre sented it as related by a Siennese? \u2014 Della Corte, whose history of Verona I have just laid down, mentions it as a real historical event; and Louis da Porta, in his beautiful novel, la Giulietta, expressly as serts that he has written it down from tradition. If Shakespeare, as it is said, never saw the novel of Da Porta, how came he by the names of Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets : if he did meet with it, how came he to depart so essentially from the story, particu larly in the catastrophe? I must get some books, if possible, to clear up these difficulties. 23d, at Padua. \u2014 We spent yesterday morning pleasantly at Vf cenza. Palladio's edifices in general dissapointed me ; partly because I am not architect enough to judge of their merits, partly because, of most of them the situation is bad, and the materials paltry : but the Olympic theatre, although its solid perspective be a mere trick of the art, surprised and pleased me. It has an air of antique and classic elegance in its decorations, which is very striking. I have heard it criticised as a specimen of bad taste and trickery : but why should its solid scenery be considered more a trick, and in bad taste, than a curtain of painted canvas ? In both a deception is practised and in tended. We saw many things in Vicenza and its neighbourhood, which I have not time nor spirits, to dwell upon. We arrived here (at Padua) last night, and to-day 1 am again ill : unable to see or even to wish to see any thing. My eyes are so full of tears that I can scarcely write. I must lay down my pencil, lest I break through my resolution, and be templed to record feelings I afterwards tremble to see written down. \u2014 0 bitter and too lasting re membrance !

Venice, Octoler 2ith. \u2014 I feel while I gaze round me, as if I had seen Venice in my dreams \u2014 as if it were itself the vision of a dream. We have been here two days ; and I have not yet recovered from my first surprise. All is yet enchantment : all is novel, extraordinary, af fecting from the many associations and remembrances excited in the mind. Pleasure and wonder are tinged with a melancholy interest ; and while the imagination is excited, the spirits are depressed. The morning we left Padua was bright, lovely, and cloudless. Our drive along the shores of the Brenta crowned with innumerable villa s and gay gardens was delightful ; and the moment of our arrival at Fusina, where we left our carriages to embark in gondolas, was the"], [36, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 24 most auspicious that could possibly have been chosen. It was about four o'clock : the sun was just declining towards the west : the whole surface of [the lagune, smooth as a mirror, appeared as if paved wilh fire ;\u2014 and Venice, with her towers and domes, indistinctly glittering in the distance, rose before us like a gorgeous exhalation from the bosom of the ocean. It is farther from the shore than I expected. As we approached, the splendour faded: but the interest and wonder grew. I can conceive nolhing more beautiful, more singular, more astonishing, than the first appearance of Venice, and sad indeed will be the hour when she sinks (as the poet prophesies) \"into the slime of her own canals.\" The moment we had disembarked our luggage at the inn, we hired gondolas and rowed to the Piazza di San Marco. Had I seen the church of St. Mark any where else, I should have exclaimed against the bad taste which every where prevails in it : but Venice is the pro per region of the fantastic, and the church of St. Mark \u2014 wilh its four hundred pillars of every different order, colour, and material, its ori ental cupolas, and glittering vanes, and gilding and mosaics \u2014 assimi lates with all around it : and the kind of pleasure it gives is suitable to the place and the people. After dinner I had a chair placed on the balcony of our inn, and sat for some time contemplating a scene altogether new and delightful. The arch of the Riallo just gleamed through the deepening twilight; long lines of palaces, at first partially illuminated, faded away at length into gloomy and formless masses of architecture ; the gondolas glided to and fro, their glancing lights reflected on the waler. There was a stillness all around me, solemn and strange in the heart of a great city. No rattling carriages shook the streets, no trampling of horses echoed along the pavement : the silence was broken only by the melancholy cry of the gondoliers, and the dash of their oars ; by the low murmur of human voices, by the chime of the vesper bells, borne over the waler, and the sounds of music raised at intervals along the canals. The poetry, the romance of the scene stole upon me unawares. I fell into a re verie, in which visionary forms and recollections gave way to dearer and sadder realities, and my mind seemed no longer in my own power. I called upon the lost, the absent, to share the present wilh me, \u2014 I called upon past feelings to enhance that moment's delight. I did wrong \u2014 and memory avenged herself as usual. I quitted my seat on the balcony, wilh despair at my heart, and drawing to the table, look oui my books and work. So passed our first evening at Venice. Yesterday we visited the Accademia where there are some sine pic tures. The famous assumption by Titian is here, and sirst made me feel what connoisseurs mean when they talk of the carnations and dra peries of Titian. We were shown two designs for monumenls to the"], [37, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 25 memory of Titian, modelled by Canova. Neither of them has been erected ; but the most beautiful, with a little alteration, and the substi tution of a lady's bust for Titian's venerable head, has been dedicated, I believe, to the memory of the Archduchess Christina of Austria. I remember also an exquisite Canaletti, quite different in style and sub ject from any picture of this master I ever saw. We then rowed to the ducal palace. The council chamber (I thought of Othello as I entered il) is now converted into a library. The walls are decorated with the history of Pope Alexander the Third, and Frederic Barbarossa, painted by the Tintoretti, father and son, Paul Veronese and Palma. Above them, in compartments, hang the portraits of the Doges; among which Marino Faliero is not; but his name only, inscribed on a kind of black pall. The Ganymede is a most exquisite little group, attributed to the age of Praxiteles ; and not wilhout reason even to the hand of that sculptor. To-day we visited several churches \u2014 rich, on the outside, with all the luxury of architecture, \u2014 withinside, gorgeous with painting, sculp- ture, and many-coloured marbles. The prodigality with which the most splendid aud costly materials are lavished here is perfectly amazing : pillars of lapis-lazuli, columns of Egyptian porphyry, and pavements of mosaic, altars of alabaster ascended by steps incrusted with agate and jasper: \u2014 but to particularize would be in vain. I will only mention three or four which I wish to recollect : the Church of the Madonna della Salute, so called because erected to the Virgin in gratitude for the deliverance of the city from a pestilence, which she miraculously drove into the Adriatic. It is remarkable for its splendid pictures, most of them by Luca Giordano; and the superb high altar. I think it was the Church of the Gesuata which astonished us most. The whole ofthe inside walls and columns are encrusted with Carrara marble inlaid with verd-antique, in a kind of damask pattern ; over the pulpit it fell like drapery, so easy, so graceful, so exquisitely imitated, lhat I was obliged to touch it lo assure myself of the material. Then by way of contrast followed the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, \u2014 one of Palladio's masterpieces. After the dazzling and gorgeous buildings we had left, its beautiful simplicity and correct taste struck me at sirst with an impression of poverty and coldness. At the Church of St. John and St. Paul is the famous martyrdom, on ralher assassina- tion, of St. Peter Martyr, by Titian, one of the most magical pictures in the world. Its tragic horror is redeemed by its sublimity. Here too is a most admirable series of bas-reliefs in white marble, representing ihe history of our Saviour, the work of a modern sculptor. Here too the Doges are buried ; and close to the Church is the equestrian statue of one of the Falicri family : near which Marino Faliero met the conspirators."], [38, "26 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE At the Frali is the grave of Titian : a small square slab covers him, with this inscription : \u2014 \" Qui giace il gran Tiziano Vecelli. Emulator dei Zeusi e degli Apelli.\" there is no monument : \u2014 and there needs none. It was, I think, in the Church of St. John and St. Paul, that I saw a singular and beautiful altar of black touch-stone, used when mass is said for the soul of an executed criminal. This is all I can remember of to-day. I am fatigued, and my head aches; \u2014 my imagination is yet dazzled: \u2014 my eyes are tired of admiring, my mind is tired of thinking, and my heart wilh feeling. Now for repose. 27. \u2014 To-day we visited the Manfrini Palace, the Casa Pisani, the Palazzo Barberigo, and concluded the morning in the colonnade of St. Mark, and the public gardens. The day has been far less fatiguing than yesterday : for though we have seen an equal variety of objects, they forced the attention less, and gratified the imagination more. At the Manfrini Palace there is the most valuable and splendid collection of pictures I have yet seen in Italy or elsewhere. I have no intention of turning my little Diary into a mere catalogue of names which I can find in every guide-book ; but I cannot pass over Giorgione's beautiful group of himself, and his wife and child, which Lord Byron calls \" love at full length and life, not love ideal,\" and it is indeed exquisite. A female with a guitar by the same master if almost equal lo it. There are two Lucretias \u2014 one by Guido and one by Giordano : though both are beautiful, particularly the former, there was, I thought, an impropriety in the conception of both pictures : the figure was too voluptuous \u2014 too exposed, and did not give me the idea of the matronly Lucretia, who so carefully arranged her drapery before she fell. I remember, too, a St. Cecilia by Carlo Dolci, of most heavenly beauty, \u2014 two Correggios \u2014 Iphigenia in Aulis, by Padovanino : in this picture the figure of Agamemnon is a complete failure, but the lifeless beauty of Iphigenia, a wonderful effort of art: and a hundred others at least, all masterpieces. The Barberigo Palace was the school of Titian. We were shown the room in which he painted, and Ihe picture he left unfinished when he died at the age of 99. It is a David \u2014 as vigorous in the touch and style as any of his first pictures. ******* * * * * It is now some days since I had time to write ; or rather the in tervals of excitement and occupation found me too much exhausted to take up my pencil. Our stay al Venice has been rendered most"], [39, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 27 agreeable by the kindness of Mr. H , the British Consul, and his amiable and charming wife, and in their society we have spent much of the last few days. One of our pleasantest excursions was to the Armenian convent of St. Lazaro, where we were received by Fra Pasquale, an accomplished and intelligent monk, and a particular friend ofMr.H . After we had visited every part of the convent, the printing press \u2014 the library \u2014 the laboratory \u2014 which contains several fine mathematical instru ments of English make; and admired the beautiful little tame gazelle which bounded through the corridors, we were politely refreshed with most delicious sweetmeats and coffee ; and took leave of Fra Pasquale with regret. There is no opera at present, but we have visited both the other theatres. At the San Luca, they gave us \"Elizabeth, the Exile of Siberia,\" tolerably acted : but there was one trait introduced very characteristic of the place and people : Elizabeth in a tremendous snow storm, is pursued by robbers; and finding a crucifix, erected by the road side, embraces it for proteclion. The crucifix flies away with her in a clap of thunder, and sets her down safely at a distance from her persecutors. The audience appeared equally enchanted and edified by this scene : some of the women near me crossed themselves, and put their handkerchiefs to their eyes : the men rose from their seats, clapped with enthusiasm, and shouted \" Bravo! Miracolo 1\" At the San Benedetto we were gratified by a deep tragedy entitled \" Gabrielle Innocente,\" so exquisitely absurd, and so grotesquely acted, that the best comedy could scarcely have afforded us more amusement, \u2014 certainly not more merriment. In the course of the evening, coffee and ices were served in our box, as is the custom here. With Mrs. H this evening I had a long and pleasant conversa tion ; she is really one of Ihe most delightful and unaffected women I ever met with : and as there is nothing in my melancholy visage and shrinking reserve lo tempt any person'to converse with me, I must also set her down as one of the most good-natured. She talked much of Lord Byron, with whom, during his residence here she was on intimate terms. She spoke of him, not conceitedly as one vain of the acquaintance ofa great character ; nor with affected reserve, as if afraid of committing herself \u2014 but with openness, animation, and cordial kindness, as one whom she liked, and had reason to like. She says the style of Lord Byron's conversation is very much that of Don Juan : just in the same manner are the familiar, the brilliant, the sublime, the affecting, the witty, the ludicrous, and the licentious, mingled and contrasted. Several little anecdotes which she related I need not write down ; I can scarcely forget them, and it would nol be quite fair"], [40, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 28 as they were told en confiance. I am no anecdote hunter, picking up articles for \" my pocket book.\" A little while ago Captain F. lent me Disraeli's Essays on the Lite rary Character, which had once belonged to Lord Byron ; and con tained marginal notes in his hand-writing. One or two of them are so curiously characteristic that I copy them here. The firstnote is on a passage in which DTsraeli, in allusion to Lord Byron, traces his fondness for oriental scenery to his having read' Rycaut at an early age. On this Lord Byron observes, lhat he read every look relating to the east before he was ten years old, including De Tott andCantemiras well as Rycaut : at that age, he says that he detested all poetry, and adds, \" when I was in Turkey, I was oftener templed lo turn mussulman than poet : and have often regretted^ since lhat I did not.\" At page 99 DTsraeli says, \"The great poetical genius of our times has openly alienated him self from the land of his brothers\" (over the word Irothers Lord Byron has written Cains.) \" He becomes immortal in the language of a people whom he would contemn, he accepts with ingratitude the fame he loves more than life, and he is only truly great on that spot of earth, whose genius, when he is no more, will contemplate his shade in sorrow and in anger.\" Lord Byron has underlined several words in this passage, and writes thus in the margin : \" What was rumoured of me in that language, if true, I was unfit for England ; and ii false, England was unfit for me. But 'there is a world elsewhere.' I have never for an instant regretted that country, \u2014 but often that I ever returned to it. It is not my fault that I am obliged to write in English. If I understood any present lan guage, Ilalian, for instance, equally well, I would write in it : \u2014 but it will require ten years, at least, to form a style. No tongue so easy to acquire a li tile of, and so difficult to master thoroughly, as Italian.\" The next note is amusing ; at page 3A2 is mentioned the anecdote of Petrarch, who when reluming to his native town, was informed that Ihe proprietor of the house in which he was horn had often wished to make alterations in it, but that the town's-people had risen to insist lhat ihe house consecrated by his birth should reman unchanged ; \u2014 \"a triumph,\" adds DTsraeli, \" more affecting to Petrarch lhan even his coronation at Rome.\" Lord Byron has written in the margin \u2014 \" It would have pained me more that the proprietor should often have wished (o make altera tions, Ihanil would give me pleasure that the rest of Arezzo rose against"], [41, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 29 his right (for right he had:) the depreciation of the lowest of mankind is more painful, than the applause of the highest is pleasing. The stingos the scorpion is more in torture than the possession of any thing short of Venus would be in rapture.\" * * * * The public gardens are the work of the French, and occupy the ex tremity ofone of the islands. They contain the only trees I have seen at Venice : \u2014 a few rows of dwarfish unhappy-looking shrubs, parched by the sea breezes, and are little frequented. We found here a solitary gentleman, who was sauntering up and down wilh his hands in his pockets, and a look at once stupid and disconsolate. Sometimes he paused, looked vacantly over the waters, whistled, yawned, and turned away to resume his solemn walk. On a trifling remark addressed (o him by one of our party, he entered into conversation, with all the eagerness of a man, whose tongue had long been kept in most unna tural bondage. He congratulated himself on having met with some one who would speak English ; adding contemptuously, that \"he under stood none of the outlandish tongues the people spoke hereabouts :\" he inquired what was to be seen here, for though he had been four days in Venice, he had spent every day precisely in the same manner; viz. walking up and down the public gardens. We told him Venice was famous for fine buildings and pictures ; he knew nothing of them things. And that it contained also, \" some fine statues and antiques\" \u2014 he cared nothing about them neither \u2014 he should set off for Florence the next morning, and begged to know what was to be seen there? Mr. R told him, with enthusiasm, \" the most splendid gallery of pictures and statues in the world !\" He looked very blank and disappointed. ' ' No thing else?\" then he should certainly not waste his time at Florence, he should go direct to Rome ; he had put down the name of that town in his pocket-book, for he understood it was a very convenient place : he should therefore stay there a week ; thence he should go to Naples, a place he had also heard of, where he should stay another week : then he should go to Algiers, where he should stay three weeks, and thence to Tunis, where he expected to be very comfortable, and should probably make along stay; thence he should return home, having seen every thing worth seeing. He scarcely seemed to know how or by what route he had got to Venice \u2014 but he assured us he had come ' ' fast enough ;\" \u2014 he remembered no place he had passed through except Paris. At Paris he told us there was a female lodging in the same hotel with himself, who by his description appears lo have been a single lady of rank and fashion, travelling with her own carriages and a suite of servants. He had never seen her ; but learning through the domestics that she was travelling the same route, he sat down and wrote her a long letter, beginning \" Dear Madam,\" and proposing they should join"], [42, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 30 company, \" for the sake of good fellowship, and the lit of chat they might have on their way.\" Of course she took no notice of this strange billet, \" from which,\" added he with ludicrous simplicity, \" I supposed she would rather travel alone.\" Truly, \" Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.\" After this specimen, sketched from life, who will say there are such things as caricatures ? We visited to-day the Giant's Staircase and the Bridge of Sighs, and took a last farewell of St. Mark \u2014 we were surprised to see the church hung with black \u2014 the festoons of flowers all removed \u2014 masses going forward at several altars, and crowds of people looking particularly so lemn and devout. It is the \" Giorno dei morte,\" the day by the Roman Catholics consecrated to the dead. I observed many persons, both men and women, who wept while they prayed, with every appearance ot the most profound grief. Leaving St. Mark, I crossed the square. On the three lofty standards in front of the church formerly floated the ensigns of the three states subjects to Venice, \u2014 the Morea, Cyprus, and Candia : the bare poles remain, but the ensigns of empire are gone. One of the standards was extended on the ground, and being of im mense length, I hesitated for a moment whether I should make a cir cuit, but at last stepped over it. I looked back with remorse, for il was like trampling over the fallen. We then returned to our inn to prepare for our departure. How I regret to leave Venice! not the less because I cannol help it. Rovigo, Nov. 3. We left Venice in a hurry yesterday, slept al Padua, and travelled this morniug through a most lovely country, among the Enganean hills to Rovigo, where we are very uncomfortably lodged at the Albergo di San Marco. I have not yet recovered my regret at leaving Venice so unexpectedly; though as a residence, I could scarce endure it; the sleepy canals, the gliding gondolas in their \"dusk livery of woe\" \u2014 the absence of all verdure, all variety \u2014 of all nature, in short ; the silence, disturbed only by the incessant chiming of bells \u2014 and, worse than all, the spec tacle ofa great city \" expiring,\" as Lord Byron says, \" before our eyes,\" would give me the horrors: but as a visitor, my curiosity was not half gratified, and I should have liked to have stayed a few days longer \u2014 pehaps after all, I have reason to rejoice that instead of bring ing away from Venice a disagreeable impression of satiety, disgust and melancholy, I have quitted it with feelings of admiration, of deep regret, and undiminished interest. Farewell, then, Venice! I could not have believed it possible that it would have brought tears to my eyes to leave a place merely for ils own sake, and unendeared by Ihe presence of any one I loved."], [43, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 31 As Rovigo affords no other amusement I shall scribble a little longer. Nolhing can be more arbitrary than the Austrian government at Venice. As a summary method of preventing robberies during the winter months, when many of the gondoliers and fishermen are out of employ, the police have orders to arrest, without ceremony, every person who has no permanent trade or profession, and keep them in confinement and to hard labour till the return of spring. The commerce of Venice has so much and so rapidly declined, that Mr. H told us when first he was appointed to the consulship, a hundred and fifty English vessels cleared the port, and this year only sive. It should seem that Austria, from a cruel and selfish policy, is sacrificing Venice to the prosperity of Trieste : but why do I call that a cruel policy, which on recollection I might rather term poetical and retributive justice? The grandeur of Venice arose first from its trade in salt. I re member reading in history, that when the king of Hungary opened certain productive salt mines in his dominions, the Venetians sent him a peremptory order to shut them up ; and such was the power of the Republic at that lime, that he was forced to obey this insolent com mand, to the great injury and impoverishment of his states. The tables are now turned ; the oppressor has become the oppressed. The principal revenue derived from Venice is from the tax on houses, there being no land tax. So rapid was the decay of the place, that in two years seventy houses and palaces were pulled down ; the government forbade this by a special law, and now taxes are paid for many houses whose proprietors are too poor to live in them. There is no society, properly so called, at Venice ; three old wo men of rank receive company now and then, and it is any thing rather than select. Mr. F. told us at Venice, that on entering the states subject to Austria, he had his Johnson's Dictionary taken from him, and could never recover it ; so jealous is the government of English principles and English literature, that all English books are prohibited until ex amined by the police. The whole country from Milan to Padua was like a vast garden, nolhing could exceed its fertility and beauty. It was the latter end of the vintage ; and we frequently met huge tub-like waggons loaded with purple grapes, reeling home from the vineyards, and driven by men whose legs were stained with treading in the wine-press \u2014 now and then, rich clusters were shaken to the ground, as I have seen wisps of straw fall from a hay-cart in England, and were regarded with equal indifference. Sometimes we saw in the vineyards by the road-side, groups of labourers seated among the branches of the trees,"], [44, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 32 and plucking grapes from the vines, which were trailed gracefully from tree to tree and from branch to branch, and drooped with their luxurious burthen of fruit. The scene would have been as perfectly delightful, as it was new and beautiful, but for the squalid looks of the peasantry; more especially ofthe women. The principal productions of the coun try seem to be wine and silk. There were vast groves of mulberry trees between Verona and Padua ; and we visited some of the silk mills, in which the united strength of men invariably performed those operations which in England are accomplished by steam or water. I saw in a huge horizontal wheel, about a dozen of these poor creatures labouring so hard, that my very heart ached to see them, and I begged that the machine might be stopped that I might speak to them : \u2014 but when it Was stopped, and I beheld their half savage, half stupi fied, I had almost said Irutified countenances, I could not utter a single WOrd \u2014 but gave them something, and turned away. \" Compassion is wasted upon such creatures,\" said R ; \" do you not see that their minds are degraded down to their condition ? they do not pity themselves :\" \u2014 but therefore did I pity them the more. al Bologna, Nov. 5. \u2014 I fear I shall retain a disagreeable impression of Bologna, for here I am again ill. I have seen little of what the town contains of beautiful and curious : and that little, under unpleasant and painful circumstances. Yesterday we passed through Ferrara; only stopping to change horses and dine. We snatched a moment to visit the hospital of St. Anna and the prison of Tasso \u2014 the glory and disgrace of Ferrara. Over the iron gate is written \" Ingresso alia prigione di Torquato Tasso.\" The cell itself is miserably gloomy and wretched, and not above twelve feet square. How amply has posterity avenged the cause of the poet on his tyrant! \u2014 and as we emerge from his obscure dungeon and descend the steps of the hospital of St. Anna, with what fervent hatred, indignation, and scorn, do we gaze upon the towers of the ugly red brick palace, or rather fortress, which deforms the great square, and where Alphonso feasted while Tasso wept ! The inscrip tion on the door of the cell, calling on strangers to venerate the spot where Tasso, \" Infermo piu di tristezza che delirio,\" was confined seven years and one month \u2014 was placed there by the French, and its accuracy may be doubted ; as far as I can recollect. The grass grow ing in the wide streets of Ferrara is no poetical exaggeration ; I saw it rank and long even on the thresholds of the deserted houses, whosi sashless windows, and flapping doors, and roofless walls, looked strangely desolate."], [45, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 33 I will say nothing of Bologna ; \u2014 for the few days I have spent here have been to me days of acute suffering, in more ways than I wish to remember, and therefore dare not dwell upon. At Covigliajo in the Apennines. \u2014 0 for the pencil of Salvator, or the pen of a Radcliffe ! Bul could eilher, or could both united, give to my mind the scenes of to-day, in all their splendid combinations of beauty and brightness, gloom and grandeur? A picture may present to the eye a small portion of the boundless whole \u2014 one aspect of the every-varying face of nature ; and words, how weak are they ! \u2014 they are but the elements out of which the quick imagination frames and composes lovely landscapes, according to ils power or its peculiar cha racter; and in which the unimaginative man finds only a mere chaos of verbiage, without form, and vofB. The scenery of the Apennines is allogelher different in character from lhat of the Alps : it is less bold, less lofty, less abrupt and terrific \u2014 hut more beautiful, more luxuriant, and infinitely more varied. At one time, the road wound among precipices and crags, crowned with dismantled fortresses and ruined castles \u2014 skirted with dark pine forests \u2014 and opening into wild recesses of gloom, and immeasurable depths like those of Tartarus profound; then came such glimpses of paradise ! such soft sunny valleys and peaceful hamlets \u2014 and vine clad eminences and rich pastures, wilh here and there a convent half hidden by groves of cypress and cedars. As we ascended we arrived at a height from which, looking back, we could see the whole of Lom bardy spread at our feet ; a vast, glittering, indistinct landscape, bounded on the north by the summits of the Alps, just apparent above the horizon, like a range of small silvery clouds ; and on the east a long unbroken line of bluish light marked the far distant Adriatic; as the day declined, and we continued our ascent (occasionally assisted by a yoke of oxen where the acclivity was very precipitate), the moun tains closed around us, the scenery became more wildly romantic, barren, and bleak. At length, after passing the crater of a volcano, visible through the gloom by its dull red light, we arrived at the Inn of Cavigliajo, an uncouth dreary edifice, situated in a lonely and deso late spot, some miles from any other habitation. This is the very inn, infamous for a series of the most horrible assassinations, committed here some years ago. Travellers arrived, departed, disappeared, and were never heard of more ; by what agency, or in what manner disposed of, could not be discovered. It was supposed for some time that a horde of banditti were harboured among the mountains, and the police were for a long time in active search for them, while the real miscreants remained unsuspected for their seeming insignificance and helplessness ; these were the mistress of the inn, the cameriere, and the curate ofthe nearest village, about two leagues off. They"], [46, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 34 secretly murdered every traveller who was supposed to carry pro- perty \u2014 buried or burned their clothes, packages, and vehicles, retain- ing nothing but their watches, jewels, and money. The whole story, with all its horrors, the manner of discovery, and the fate of these wretches, is told, I think, by Forsyth, who can hardly be suspected of romance or exaggeration. I have him not with me to refer to ; but I well remember the mysterious and shuddering dread with which I read the anecdote. I am glad no one else seems to recollect it. The inn at present contains many more than it can possibly accommodate. We have secured the best rooms, or rather the only rooms \u2014 and be- sides ourselves and other foreigners, there are numbers of native tra- vellers : some of whom arrived on horseback, and others with the Vetturini. A kind of gallery or corridor separates the sleeping rooms, and is divided by a curtain into two parts : the smaller is appropriated to us, as a saloon : the other half, as I contemplate it at this moment through a rent in the curtain, presents a singular and truly Italian spectacle \u2014 a huge black iron lamp, suspended by a chain from the rafters, throws a flaring and shifting light around. Some trusses of hay have been shaken down upon the floor, to supply the place of beds, chairs, and tables ; and there, reclining in various attitudes, I see a number of dark looking figures, some eating and drinking, some sleeping ; some playing at cards, somo telling stories with all (he Italian variety of gesticulation and intonation ; some silently looking on, or listening. Two or three common looking fellows began to smoke their segars, but when it was suggested that this might incom mode the ladies on the other side of the curtain, they with genuine politeness ceased directly. Through Ihis motley and picturesque as semblage I have to make my way to my bed-room in a few minutes \u2014 I will take another look at them, and then andiamo ! Florence, Nov. 8. \u2014 \"La bellisema e famosissima figlia di Roma,\" as Dante calls her in some relenting moment. Last night we slept in a blood-stained hovel \u2014 and to-night we are lodged in a palace. So much for the vicissitudes of travelling. I am not subject to idle fears, and least of all to superstitious fears \u2014 but last night, at Covigliajo, I could not sleep \u2014 I could not even lie down for more than a few minutes together. The whispered voices and hard breathing of the men who slept in the corridor, from whom only a slight door divided me, disturbed and severed my nerves ; hor rible imaginings were all around me : and gladly did I throw open my window at the first glimpse of the dawn, and gladly did I hear the first well-known voice which summoned me to a hasty breakfast. How reviving was the breath of the early morning, after leaving (hat close, suffocating, ill-omened inn ! how beautiful the blush of light stealing downwards from the illumined summits to Ihe valleys, tinting"], [47, "DIARY OF AN UNNUYEE. 35 the fleecy mists, as they rose from the earth, till all Ihe landscape was flooded wilh sunshine : and when at length we passed the mountains, and began to descend into the rich vales of Tuscany \u2014 when from the heights above Fesole we beheld the city of Florence, and above it the young moon and the evening star suspended side by side ; and floaling over the whole ofthe Val d'Arno, and the lovely hills which enclose it, a mist, or rather a suffusion of the richest rose colour, which gra dually, as the day declined, faded, or rather deepened into purple ; then I first understood all the enchantment of an Italian landscape. \u2014 0 what a country is this ! All that I see, I feel \u2014 all that lfeel, sinks so deep into my heart and my memory ! the deeper because I suffer \u2014 and because I never think of expressing, or sharing, one emotion with those around me, but lock it up in my own bosom; or at least in my lillle book \u2014 as I do now. Nov. 10. \u2014 We visited the gallery for the first time yesterday morn ing ; and I came away with my eyes and imagination so dazzled with excellence, and so distracted with variety, that I retained no distinct recollection of any particular object except the Venus ; which of course was the first and great attraction. This morning was much more delightful ; my powers of discrimination returned, and my power of enjoyment was not diminished. New perceptions of beauty and ex cellence seemed to open upon my mind ; and faculties long dormant, were roused to pleasurable activity. I came away untired, unsated; and with a delightful and distinct impression of all I had seen. I leave to catalogues to particularise ; and am content to admire and to remember. I am glad I was not disappointed in the Venus which I half expect ed. Neither was I surprised : but I felt while I gazed a sense of un alloyed and unmingled pleasure, and forgot the cant of criticism. It has the same effect to the eye, that perfect harmony has upon the ear : and I think I can understand why no copy, cast, or model, however accurate, however exquisite, can convey the impression of tenderness and sweetness, the divine and peculiar charm ofthe original. After dinner we walked in the grounds of the Cascine, \u2014 a dairy farm belonging to the grand Duke, just without the gates of Florence. The promenade lies along the bank of the river, and is sheltered and beautiful. We saw few native Italians, but great numbers of English walking and riding. The day was as warm, as sunny, as brilliant as the first days of September in England. To-night, after resting a little, I went out to view the effect of the city and surrounding scenery, by moonlight. It is not alone the bril liant purity of the skies and atmosphere, nor the peculiar character of the scenery which strikes a stranger ; but here art harmonizes with nature : the style of the buildings, their flat projecting roofs, white 3*"], [48, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 36 walls, balconies, colonnades and statues, are all set off to advantage by the radiance of an Italian moon. I walked across the first bridge, from which I had a fine view ofthe Ponte della Triniti, wilh ils graceful arches and light balustrade, touched with the sparkling moonbeams and relieved by dark shadow : then I strolled along the quay in front of the Corsini palace, and beyond the colonnade of the Ustizi, lo the last of the four bridges ; on the middle of which I stood and looked back upon the city \u2014 (how justly styled the Fair !) \u2014 with all ils buildings, its domes, its steeples, its bridges, and woody hills and glittering convents, and marble villas, peeping from embowering olives and cypresses ; and far off the snowy peaks of Ihe Apennines, shining against the dark purple sky : the whole blended together in one delicious scene of shadowy splen- dour. After contemplating it with a kind of melancholy delight, long enough to get it by heart, I returned homewards. Men were standing on the wall along the Arno, in various picturesque attitudes, fishing, after the Italian fashion, with singular nets suspended to long poles; and as I saw their dark figures between me and the moonlight, and elevated above my eye, they looked like colossal statues. I then strayed into the Piazza del Gran Duca. Here the rich moonlight, streaming through the arcade of the gallery, fell directly upon the fine Perseus of Benvenuto Cellini ; and illuminating the green bronze, touched it with a spectral and supernatural beauty. Thence I walked round the equestrian statue of Cosmo, and so home over the Ponte Alia Carrajo. Nov. li. \u2014 I spent about two hours in the gallery, and for the first time saw the Niobe. This statue has been for a long time a favourite of my imagination, and I approached it, treading soflly and slowly, and with a seeling of reverence; for I had an impression that the ori ginal Niobe would, like Ihe original Venus, surpass all the casts and copies I had seen both in beauty and expression : but apparently ex pression is more easily caught lhan delicacy and grace, and the gran deur and pathos of the altitude and grouping easily copied \u2014 for I think the best casts of the Niobe are accurate counterparts of the original; and at the first glance I was capriciously disappointed, because the statue did not surpass my expectations. It should be contemplated from a distance. It is supposed lhat the whole group once ornament ed the pediment of a temple\u2014 probably the temple of Diana or Latona. I once saw a beautiful drawing by Mr. Cockerell, of the manner in which he supposed the whole group was distributed. Many of the figures are rough and unfinished at the back, as if they had been placed on a height, and viewed only in front. In the same room wilh the Niobe is a head which struck me moro \u2014 Ihe A lexandremourant. The title seemed to me misapplied; for"], [49, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 37 tltere is something indignant and upbraiding, as well as mournful, in the expression of this magnificent head. It is undoubtedly Alexander \u2014 but Alexander reproaching the gods \u2014 or calling upon Heaven for new worlds to conquer. I visited also the gallery of Bronzes : it contains, among other master-pieces, the aerial Mercury of John of Bologna, of which we see such a multiplicity of copies. There is a conceit in perching him upon the bluff cheeks of a little Eolus : but what exquisite lightness in the figure ! \u2014 how it mounts, how it floats, disdaining the earth ! On leaving the gallery, I sauntered about ; visited some churches, and then returned home depressed and wearied : and in this melancholy humour I had better close my book, lest I be tempted to write what I could not bear to see written. Sunday. \u2014 At the English ambassador's chapel. To attend public worship among our own countrymen, and hear the praises of God in our native accents, in a strange land, among a strange people ; where a different language, different manners, and a different religion prevail, affecls the mind, or at least ought to affect it ; \u2014 and deeply too : yet I cannot say that I felt devout this morning. The last day I visited St. Mark's, when I knelt down beside the poor weeping girl and her dove basket, my heart was touched, and my prayers, I humbly trust, were not unheard : to-day, in that hot close crowded room, among those fine people flaunting in all the luxury of dress, I felt suffocated, fe verish, and my head ached \u2014 the clergyman too * * a, * * * Samuel Bogers paid us a long visit this morning. He does not look as if the suns of Italy had revivified him \u2014 but he is as amiable and amusing as ever. He talked long, etavec beaucoup d'onction, of orto lans and figs ; till melhought it was the very poetry of epicurism ; and put me in mind of his own suppers \u2014 \" Where blushing fruits through scatter'd leaves invite, Still clad in bloom and veiled in azure light. The wine as rich in years as Horace sings ;\" and the rest of his description, worthy of a poetical Apicius. Bogers may beseenevery day about eleven or twelve in the Tribune, seated opposite to the Venus, which appears lo he the exclusive object of his adoration ; and gazing, as if he hoped, like another Pygmalion, to animate the statue; or ralher perhaps that the statue might animate him. A young Englishman of fashion, wilh as much talent as espie glerie, placed an epistle in verse between the fingers of the statue, ad dressed to Rogers ; in which the goddess entreats him not lo come there oglinge\\ery day ; \u2014 for though \"partial friends might deem him still alive,\" she knew by his looks that he had come from the other side of the Styx ; and retained her antique abhorrence of the spectral"], [50, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 38 dead, etc. etc. She concluded by beseeching him, if he could not de sist from haunting her with his ghostly presence, at least to spare her the added misfortune of being be-rhymed by his muse. Rogers, with equal good nature and good sense, neither noticed these lines nor withdrew his friendship and intimacy from the writer. Carlo Dolce is not one of my favourite masters. There is a cloying sweetness in his style, a general want of power which wearies me : yet I brought away from the Corsini Palace to-day an impression of a head by Carlo Dolce (La Poesia), which I shall never forget. Now I recall the picture, I am at a loss to tell where lies the charm which has thus powerfully seized on my imagination. Here are no \" eyes upturned like one inspired\"\u2014 no distortion \u2014 no rapt enthusiasm \u2014 no Muse full of the God; \u2014 but it is a head so purely, so divinely intellectual, so heavenly sweet, and yet so penetrating, \u2014 so full of sensibility, and yet so unstained by earthly passion \u2014 so brilliant, and yet so calm \u2014 that if Carlo Dolce had lived in our days, I should have thought he intended it for the personified genius of Wordsworth's poetry. There is such an individual reality about this beautiful head, that I am inclined to be lieve the tradition, that it is the portrait of one of Carlo Dolce's daugh ters who died young : \u2014 and yet \" Did ever mortal mixture of earth's mould Breathe such divine , enchanting ravishment ?\" Nov. 15. \u2014 Our stay at Florence promises lo be far gayer than either Milan or Venice, or even Paris ; more diversified by society, as well as affording a wider field of occupation and amusement. Sometimes in the long evenings, when fatigued and over-excited, I recline apart on the sofa, or bury myself in the recesses oiafauteuil ; when I am aware that my mind is wandering away to forbidden themes, I force my attention to what is going forward ; and often see and hear much that is entertaining, if not improving. People are so accustomed tomypaleface, languid indifference and, whatM calls, my imprac ticable silence, that after the first glance and introduction, 1 believe they are scarcely sensible of my presence : so I sit, and look, and listen, secure and harboured in my apparent dullness. The flashed ol wit, the attempts at sentiment, the affectation of enthusiasm, the ab surdities of folly, and the blunders of ignorance ; the contrast of cha racters and the clash of opinions, the scandalous anecdotes of the day, related with sprightly malice, and listened lo wilh equally malicious avidity,\u2014 all these, in my days of health and happiness, had power to surprise, or amuse, or provoke me. I could mingle then in the con flict of minds ; and hoar my part with smiles in Ihe social circle ;"], [51, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 39 though the next moment, perhaps, I might contemn myself and others : and the personal scandal, the characteristic tale, the amusing folly, or the malignant wit, were effaced from my mind \u2014 \" Like forms with chalk Painted on rich men's floors for one feast night.\" Now it is different : I can smile yet, but my smile is in pity, rather than in mockery. If suffering has subdued my mind to seriousness, and perhaps enfeebled its powers, I may at least hope lhat it has not soured or imbittered my temper : \u2014 if what could once amuse, no longer amuses, \u2014 what could once provoke has no longer power to irritate : thus my loss may be improved into a gain \u2014 car tout est bien, quand tout est mal. It is sorrow which makes our experience ; it is sorrow which teaches us lo feel properly for ourselves and for others. We must feel deeply, before we can think rightly. Il is not in the tempest and storm of passions we can reflect, \u2014 but afterwards when the waters have gone over our soul ; and like the precious gems and Ihe rich merchandize which the wild wave casts on the shore out of the wreck it has made \u2014 such are the thoughts left by retiring passions. Reflection is the result of seeling ; from that absorbing, heart rending compassion for oneself (the most painful sensation, almost, of which our nature is capable), springs a deeper sympathy for others ; and from the sense of our own weakness, and our own self-upbraiding, arises a disposition to be indulgent \u2014 to forbear \u2014 and to forgive \u2014 so at least it ought to be. When once we have shed those inexpressibly bitter tears, which fall unregarded, and which we forget to wipe away, 0 how we shrink from inflicting pain! how we shudder at unkindness! \u2014 and think all harshness even in thought, only another name for cruelty ! These are but common-place truths, I know, which have often been a thousand times better expressed. Formerly I heard them, read them, and thought I believed them : now I feel them ; and seel ing, I utter them as if they were something new. \u2014 Alas ! the lessons of sorrow are as old as the world itself. To-day we have seen nothing new. In the morning I was ill : in Ihe afternoon we drove to the Cascina ; and while the rest walked, I spread my shawl upon the bank and basked like a lizard in the sunshine . It was a most lovely day, a summer-day in England. In this paradise of a country, the common air, and earth, and skies, seem happiness enough. While I sat to-day, on my green bank \u2014 languid, indeed, but free from pain \u2014 and looked round upon a scene which has lost its novelty, but none of ils beauty, \u2014 where Florence, with its glittering domes and its back-ground of sunny hills, terminated my view on one side, and the Apennines, tinted with rose colour and gold, bounded it"], [52, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 40 on the other, I felt not only pleasure, but a deep thankfulness lhat such pleasures were yet left to me. Among the gay figures who passed and repassed before me, I re marked a benevolent but rather heavy-looking old gentleman, with a shawl hanging over his arm, and holding a parasol, with which he was gallantly shading a little plain old woman from the November sun. After them walked two young ladies, simply dressed ; and then fol lowed a tall and very handsome young man, with a plain hut elegant girl hanging on his arm. This was the Grand Duke and his family; with the Prince of Carignano, who has lately married one of his daughters. Two servants in plain drab liveries, followed at a consider able distance. People politely drew on one side as they approached ; but no other homage was paid to the sovereign, who thus takes his walk in public almost every day. Lady Morgan is merry at the ex pense of the Grand Duke's taste for brick and mortar : but monarchs, like other men, must have their amusements ; some invent uniforms, some stitch embroidery ; \u2014 and why should not this good-nalured Grand Duke amuse himself with his trowel if he likes it? As to the Prince of Carignano, I give him up to her lash \u2014 le traitre \u2014 but perhaps he thought he was doing right : and at all events there are not flatterers wanting, to call his perfidy patriotism. I am told that Florence retains its reputation of being the most devout capital in Italy, and lhat here love, music, and devotion hold divided empire, or rather are tria juncta in ano. The liberal patro nage and taste of Lord Burghersh, contribute perhaps to make music so much a passion as it is at present. Magnelli, the Grand Duke's Maestra di Cappella, and director of the Conservatorio, is the finest tenor in Italy. I have the pleasure of hearing him frequently, and think the purity of his taste at least equal to the perfection of his voice; rare praise for a singer in these \" most brisk and giddy-paced limes.\" He gave us last night the beautiful recitative which introduces Desde mona's song in Othello \u2014 \" Nessun maggior dolore, Che ricordarsi del tempo felice Nella miseria !\" and the words, the music, and the divine pathos of the mau's voice combined, made me feel \u2014 as I thought I never could have felt again. TO As sounds of sweetest music, heard at eve, When summer dews weep over languid flowers. When the still air conveys each touch, each tone, However faint \u2014 and breathes il on the ear"], [53, "D1A11Y OF AN ENNUYEE. 41 With a distinct and thrilling power, that leaves Its memory long within the raptur'd soul. \u2014 \u2014 Even such thou art lo me ! \u2014 and thus I sit And feel the harmony that round thee lives. And breathes from every feature. Thus I sit \u2014 And when most quiet \u2014 cold \u2014 or silent \u2014 then Even then, I feel each word, each look, each tone ! There's not an accent of that tender voice. There's not a day-beam of those sunbright eyes, Nor passing smile, nor melancholy grace, Nor thought halfutter'd, seeling halls betray'd Nor glance os kindness, \u2014 no, nor gentlest touch Of that dear hand, in amity extended, That e'er was lost to me ; \u2014 that treasur'd well. And oft recall'd, dwells not upon my soul Like sweetest music heard at summer's eve ! Yesterday we visited the church of San Lorenzo, the Laurenliau library, and the Pietra Dura manufactory, and afterwards spent an hour in the Tribune. In a little chapel in the San Lorenzo are Michel Angelo's famous statues, the Morning, Ihe Noon, the Evening, and Ihe Night. 1 looked at them with admiration rather than with pleasure ; for there is something in Ihe severe and overpowering style of this master, which affecls me disagreeably, as beyond my feeling, and above my com prehension. These statues are very ill disposed for effect : the con fined cell (such it seemed) in which they are placed is so strangely dis proportioned to the awful and massive grandeur of their forms. There is a picture by Michel Angelo, considered a chef-d'oeuvre, which hangs in the Tribune, to the right of the Venus : now if all the connaisseurs in the world, with Vasari at their head, were lo harangue for an hour together on the merits of this picture, I might submit in silence, for I am no connoisseur ; but that it is a disagreeable, a hateful picture, is an opinion which fire could not melt out of me. In spite of Messieurs les Connaisseurs, and Michel Angelo's fame, I would die in it at the slake: for instance, here is the Blessed Virgin, not the \" Vergine Santa, d'ogni grazia piena,\" but a Virgin, whose brick-dust coloured face, harsh unfeminine features, and muscular, masculine arms, give me the idea of a washerwoman, (con rispetto parlando !) an infant Saviour wilh the proportions of a giant : and what shall we say of the nudity of the figures in the back-ground ; profaning the sub ject and shocking at once good taste and good sense ? A little farther on, the eye rests on the divine Madre di Dio of Correggio : what beauty, what sweetness, what maternal love, and humble adoration are blended in the look and attitude with which she bends over her infant ! Beyond it hangs the Madonna del Cardellino of Raffaelle: what heavenly grace, what simplicity, what saint-like purity, in the ex pression of that face, and that exquisite mouth ! And from these must I turn back, on pain of being thought an ignoramus, lo admire the"], [54, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 42 coarse perpetration of Michel Angelo \u2014 because it is Michel Angelo's? But I speak in ignorance.* To relurn to San Lorenzo. The chapel of the Medici, begun by Ferdinand the First, where coarse brickwork and plaster mingle with marble and gems, is still unfinished and likely to remain so : it did not interest me. The fine bronze sarcophagus, which encloses the ashes of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and of his brother Giuliano, assassinated by the Pazzi, interested me far more. While I was standing carelessly in front of the high altar, 1 happened to look down, and under my feet were these words, \" To Cosmo the Venerable, the Father of 'his Country.\" I moved away in haste, and before I had decided to my own satisfaction upon Cosmo's claims to the gratitude and veneration of posterity, we left the church. At the Laurentian library we were edified by the sight of some famous old manuscripts, invaluable to classical scholars. To my un learned eyes the manuscript of Petrarch, containing portraits of himself and Laura, was more interesting. Petrarch is hideous \u2014 but I was pleased wilh the head of Laura, which in spile of the antique dryness and stiffness of the painting, has a soft and delicate expression not un like one of Carlo Dolce's Madonnas. Here we saw Galileo's fore singer, pointing up to the skies from a white marble pedestal ; and exciting more derision than respect. At the Pietra Dura, notwithstanding the beauty and durability of some of the objects manufactured, the result seemed to me scarce worth the incredible time, patience, and labour required in the work. Par exemple, six months' hard labour spent upon a butterfly in the lid of a snuff-box seems a most disproportionate waste of time. Thirty workmen are employed here at the Grand Duke's expense; for this manufacture, like that ofthe Gobelins at Paris, is exclusively carried on for the sovereign. Nov. 20. \u2014 I am struck in this place with grand beginnings and mean endings. I have not yet seen a finished church, even the Duomo has no facade. Yesterday we visited the Palazzo Mozzi lo see Benvenuto's picture, \"The Night after the Battle of Jena.\" Then several churches \u2014 the Santa Croce, which is hallowed ground: the Annonciala, celebrated for the frescos of Andrea del Sarto ; and the Carmine, which pleased me by the light elegance of its architecture, and its fine alto-relievos in white marble. In this church is the chapel of the Madonna del Car mele, painted by Masuccio, and the most ancient frescos extant: they are curious rather than heauliful, and going to decay. To-day we visited the school of (he Fine Aris : il contains a very fine This was indeed ignorance ! (1S3<1.)"], [55, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 43 and ample collection of casts after the antique ; and some of the works of modern artists and students are exhibited. Were I lo judge from the specimens I have seen here and elsewhere, I should say that a cold , glaring, hard tea-tray style prevails in painting, and a still worse taste, if possible, in sculpture. No soul, no grandeur, no simplicity; a meagre insipidity in the conception, a nicety of finish in the detail ; affectation instead of grace, distortion instead of power, and prettiness instead of beauty. Yet the artists who execute these works, and those who buy them, have free access to the marvels of the gallery, and the treasures of the Pitti Palace. Are they sans eyes, sans souls, sans taste, sans every thing, but money and self-conceit? Nov . 22. \u2014 Our mornings, however otherwise occupied, are gene rally concluded by an hour in the gallery or at the Pitti Palace; the evenings are spent in the Mercato Nuovo, in the workshops of artists, or al Ihe Cascina. To-day at Ihe gallery I examined the Dutch school and the Salle des Portraits, and ended as usual with the Tribune. The Salle des Portraits contains a complete collection of the portraits of painters down lo the present day. In general their respective countenances are ex pressive of their characters and style of painting. Poor Harlow's pic ture, painted by himself, is here. , , The Dutch and Flemish painters (in spite of their exquisite pots and pans, and cabbages and carrots, their birch-brooms, in which you can count every twig, and their carpets, in which you can reckon every thread) do not interest me; their landscapes too, however natural, are mere Dutch nature (with some brilliant exceptions), fat callle, clipped trees, boors, and windmills. Of course I am notspeatking of Vandyke, nor of Rubens, he that \" in the colours of the rainbW lived,\" nor of Rembrandt, that king of clouds and shadows ; but for mine own part, I would give up all that Mieris, Netscher, Teniers, and Gerard Douw ever produced, for one of Claude's Eden-like creations, or one of Guido's lovely heads \u2014 or merely for the pleasure of looking at Titian's Flora once a day, I would give a whole gallery of Dutchmen, if I had them. In the daughter of Herodias, by Leonardo da Vinci, there is the same eternal face he always paints, but with a peculiar expression \u2014 she turns away her head wilh the air of a fine lady, whose senses are shocked by the sight of blood and death, while her heart remains un touched either by remorse or pity. His ghastly Medusa made me shudder while it fascinated me, as if in Ihose loathsome snakes, writhing and glittering round the expiring head, and those abhorred and fiendish abominations crawling into life, there still lurked the fabled spell which pelrisied the beholder. Poor Medusa ! was Ihis the guerdon of thy love? and were those the Irossos"], [56, "44 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. which enslaved the ocean's lord? Methinks lhat in this wild mytho logical fiction, in the terrific vengeance which Minerva takes for her profaned temple, and in the undying snakes which for ever hiss round (he head of her victim\u2014 there is a deep moral, if woman would lay it to her heart. In Guercino's Endymion, the very mouth is asleep : in his Sybil the very eyes are prophetic, and glance into futurity. The boyish, but divine St. John, by Raffaelle, did not please me so well as some of his portraits and Madonnas ; his Leo the Tenth, for instance, his Julius the Second, or even his Fornarina : and I may ob- serve here, that I admire Titian's taste much more than Raffaelle's, en fait de maitresse. The Fornarina is a mere femme dupeuple, a coarse virago, compared to the refined, the exquisite La Manto, in the Pitti Palace. I think the Flora must have been painted from the same lovely model, as far as I can judge from compared recollections, for I have no authority to refer to. The former is the most elegant, and the latter the most poetical female portrait I ever saw. At Titian's Venus in the Tribune, one hardly ventures to look up ; it is the perfection of earthly loveliness, as the Venus de' Medici is all ideal \u2014 all celestial beauty. In the multiplied copies and engravings of this picture I see every where the bashful sweetness of the countenance, and the tender languid repose of the figure are made coarse, or something worse : de graded, in short, into a character altogether unlike the original. I say nothing of Ihe Gallery of the Palazzo Pitti; which is not a collection so much as aselection ofthe most invaluable gems and mas terpieces of art. The imagination dazzled and bewildered by excel lence can scarcely make a choice \u2014 but I think the Madonna Della Seggiola of Raffaelle, Allori's magnificent Judith, Guido's Cleopatra, and Salvator's Catiline, dwell most upon my memory. At * * * * * Nov. 2k. \u2014 After dinner, we drove to the beautiful gardens of the Villa Strozzi, on the Monle Ulivetto, and the evening we spent at the Cocomero, where we saw a detestable opera, capitally acted, and heard the most vile, noisy, unmeaning music, sung to perfection. Nov. 26. \u2014 Yesterday we spent some hours at Morghen's gallery, looking over his engravings ; and afterwards examined the bronze gates of the Baptistery, which Michel Angelo used to call the gates of Paradise. We then ascended the Campanile or Belfry Tower to see the view from its summit. Florence lay at our feet, diminished to a model of itself, wilh its walls and gates, its slreets and bridges, palaces and churches, all and each distinctly visible; and beyond, the Val d'Arno with its amphitheatre of hills, its villas, and its vineyards \u2014 classical Fesole, with its ruined castle, and Monte Ulivetto, with its diadem of cypresses ; luxuriant nature and graceful art, blendin\" inlo"], [57, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 45 one glorious picture, which no smoky vapours, no damp exhalations, blotted and discoloured ; but all was serenely bright and fair, gav with moving life, and rich with redundant fertility. 0 dell' Etruria gran Citta Reina, D'arti e di studj e di grand' or feconda ; Cui tra quanto il sol guarda, e '1 mar circonda, Ogn' altra in pregio di belta s' inchina : Monti superbi, la cui fronte alpina Fa di se contra i venti argine e sponda \u25a0 Valli beate, per cui d'onda in onda I-a'Arno con passo signoril cammina: Bei soggiorni ove par ch' abbiansi eletto Le grazie il seggio, e, come in suo confine, Sia di natura il bel tutto ristretto, 8_c.

I know myself weak \u2014 I feel myself unhappy ; and to sind my own feelings reflected from the pages of a book, in language too deeply and eloquently true, is not good for me. I want no helps lo admiration, nor need I kindle my enthusiasm at the torch of another's mind. I can suffer enough, feel enough, think enough, wilhout this. Not being well, I spent a long morning at home, and then strayed into the church of the Santo Spirito, which is near our hotel. There is in this church a fine copy of Michel Angelo's Pieta, which a monk, whom I met in the church, insisted was the original. But I believe the originalissimo group is at Rome. There are also two sine pic tures, a marriage of the Virgin, in a very sweet Guido-like style, and the woman taken in adultery. This church is the richest in paint ings I have seen here. I remarked a picture of the Virgin said to be possessed of miraculous powers ; and that part of it visible, is not destitute of merit as a painting ; but some of her grateful devotees, having decorated her with a real blue silk gown, spangled with tinsel stars, and two or three crowns, one above another, of gilt foil, the effect is the oddest imaginable. As I was silling upon a marble step, philosophizing to myself, and wondering at what seemed to me such senseless bad taste, such pitiable and ridiculous superstition, there came up a poor woman leading by the hand a pale and delicate boy, about four years old. She prostrated herself before the picture, while Ihe child knelt beside her, and prayed for some time wilh fervour ;"], [58, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 46 she then listed him up, and the mother and child kissed the picture alternately with great devotion ; then making him kneel down and clasp his lillle hands, she began to teach him an Ave Maria, repeating it word for word, slowly and distinctly, so that I got il by heart too. Having finished their devotions, the mother put into the child's hands a piece of money, which she directed him to drop into a box, inscrib ed, \"peri poveri vergognosi\" \u2014 \"for the bashful poor;\" they then went their way. I was an unperceived witness of this little scene, which strongly affected me : the simple piety of this poor woman, though mistaken in its object, appeared to me respectable ; and the Virgin, in her sky-blue brocade and her gilt tiara, no longer an object lo ridicule. I returned home rejoicing in kinder, gentler, happier thoughts ; for though I may wish these poor people a purer worship, yet, as Wordsworth says somewhere, far better lhan I could express il\u2014 \" Rather would I instantly decline To the traditionary sympathies Of a most rustic ignorance, \u2014 This rather would I do, than see and hear The repetitions wearisome of sense Where soul is dead, and seeling hath no place.

I sat down at the window and read Foscolo's beautiful poem, \" I sepolcri :\" the subject of my book, and the sight of Alsieri's house meeting my eye whenever I looked up, inspired the idea of visiting the Santa Croce again, and I ventured out unattended. The streets, and particularly ihe Lung' Arno, were crowded with gay people in their holiday costumes. Not even our Hyde Park, on a summer Sunday, ever presented a more lively spectacle or a better dressed mob. I was often tempted to lurn back ralher than encounter this moving multitude; but at length I found Hail, 0 Maria, full of grace! the Lord is with thee ! blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, even Jesus. Holy Virgin Mary mother of God ! pray for us sinners\u2014 both now and in the hour of death' Amen [Ed.]"], [59, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 47 my way lo the Santa Croce, which presented a very different scene. The service was over; and a few persons were walking up and down the aisles, or kneeling at different altars. In a chapel on the other side of the cloisters, they were chanting the Via Crucis ; and the blend ed voices swelled and floated round, then died away, then rose again, and at length sunk inlo silence. The evening was closing fast, the shadows of the heavy pillars grew darker and darker, the tapers round the high altar twinkled in the distance like dots of light, and the tombs of Michel Angelo, of Galileo, of Machiavelli, and Alfieri, were projected from the deep shadow in indistinct formless masses : but I needed not to see them to image them before me ; for with each and all my fancy was familiar. I spent about an hour walking up and down \u2014 abandoned to thoughts which were melancholy, but not bitter. All memory, all feeling, all grief, all pain were swallowed up in the sublime tranquillity which was within me and around me. How could I think of myself, and of the sorrow which swells at my im patient heart, while all of genius that could die, was sleeping round me ; and the spirits of the glorious dead \u2014 they who rose above their fellow men by the might of intellect \u2014 whose aim was excellence, the noble end \"that made ambition virtue,\" were, or seemed to me, present? \u2014 and if (hose tombs could have opened their ponderous and marble jaws, what histories of sufferings and persecution, wrongs and wretchedness, might they not reveal! Galileo \u2014 \" chi vide Sotto 1'cterco ]>adiglion rotarsi Piu mondi, e il sole iradiarli immoto.\" pining in the dungeons of the inquisition ; Machiavelli, \" quel grande, Che temprando lo scettro a' regnatori, Gil allor ne sfronda \" tortured and proscribed ; Michel Angelo, persecuted by envy ; and Alfieri perpetually torn, as he describes himself, by two furies \u2014 \" Ira e Malinconia\" \u2014 \" La mente e il cor in perpetua lite.\" But they fulfilled their destinies : inexorable Fate will be avenged upon the favourites of Heaven and nature. I can remember but one instance in which the greatly gifted spirit was not also the conspicu ously wretched mortal \u2014 our own divine Shakspeare \u2014 and of him we know but little. In some books of travels I have met with, Boccaccio, Aretino, and Guicciardini, are mentioned among the illustrious dead of the Sanla Croce. The second, if his biographers say true, was a wretch, whose ashes ought to have been scattered in the air. He was buried I he-"], [60, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 48 lieve at Venice \u2014 or no mailer where. Boccaccio's tomb is, or was, at Certaldo ; and Guicciardini's\u2014 I forget the name of the church ho noured by his remains \u2014 bul it is not the Santa Croce. The finest figure on the tomb of Michel Angelo is architecture. It should be contemplated from the left, to be seen to advantage. The effect of Alfieri's monument depends much on the position of the spec tator : when viewed in front, the figure of Italy is very heavy and clumsy ; and in no point of view has it the grace and delicacy which Canova's statues generally possess. There is a most extraordinary picture in this church representing God the Father supporting a dead Christ, by Cigoli, a painter lillle known in England, though I have seen some admirable pictures of his in the collections here : his style reminds me of Spagnoletto's. * * * -t * Our departure is fixed for Wednesday next : and though I know that change and motion are good for me, yet I dread the fatigue and excitement of travelling; and I shall leave Florence wilh regret. For a melancholy invalid like myself, there cannot be a more delightful residence : it is gay without tumult \u2014 quiet, yet not dull. I have not mingled in society ; therefore cannot judge of the manners of the people. I truslthey are not exactly what Forsyth describes: with all his taste he sometimes writes like a caustic old bachelor : and on the Florentines he is peculiarly severe. We leave our fpiend L. behind for a few days, and our Venice ac quaintance V. will be our compagnon de voyage to Rome. Of these two young men, the sirst amuses me by his follies, the latter rather fatigues de trop de raison. The first talks too much, the latter too little : the first speaks, and speaks egregious nonsense ; the latter never says any thing beyond common-place : the former always makes himself ridiculous, and the latter never makes himself particularly agreeable: Ihe first is (con rispeito parlando) a great fool, and the latter would be pleasanter were he less wise. Between these two opposites, I was standing this evening on the banks of the Arno, con templating a sunset of unequalled splendour. L. finding that enthu siasm was his cue, played off various sentimental antics, peeped through his fingers, threw his head on one side, exclaiming, \" Magnificent, by Jove! grand ! grandissimo ! It just reminds me of what Shakspeare says : ' Fair Aurora' \u2014 I forget the rest.\" V. with his hands in his pockets, contemplated the superb spec tacle\u2014the mountains, the valley, the city flooded with a crimson glory, and the river flowing at our feet like molten gold\u2014 he gazed on it all with a look of placid satisfaction, and then broke out \" Well ! this does one's heart good !\" L. (I owe him this justice) is not the author of the famous blunder"], [61, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 49 which is now repeated in every circle. I am assured it was our neighbour, Lord G. though I scarce believe it, who on being pre sented with the Countess of Albany's card, exclaimed \u2014 I The Coun tess of Albany ! Ah ! \u2014 true \u2014 I remember : wasn't she the widow of Charles the Second, who married Ariosto?\" There is in this cele brated beveu, a glorious confusion of times and persons, beyond even my friend L's capacity. The whole party are gone to the Countess of Albany's to-night lo lake leave : that being, as L. says, \" the correct thing.\" Our notions of correctness vary wilh country and climate. What Englishwoman at Florence would not be au desespoir, to be shut from the Countess of Albany's parties \u2014 though it is a known and indisputable fact, lhat she was never married to Alfieri? A propos d'Alsieri \u2014 I have just been reading a selection of his tragedies \u2014 his Filippo, the Pazzi, Vir ginia, Mirra; and when I have finished Saul, I will read no more of them for some time. There is a superabundance of harsh energy, and a want of simplicity, tenderness, and repose throughout, which fatigues me, until admiration becomes an effort instead of a pleasur able feeling. Marochesi, a celebrated tragedian, who, Minulti says, understood \"la vera filosofia della comica,\" used to recite Alsieri's tragedies with him or to him. Alfieri was himself a bad actor and declaimer. I am surprised that the tragedy of Mirra should be a great favourite on the stage here. A very young actress, who made her debut in this character, enchanted the whole city by the admir able manner in which she performed it ; and the piece was played for eighteen nights successively ; a singular triumph for an actress, though not uncommon for a singer. In spite of its many beauties and the artful management of the story, it would, I think, be as im possible to make an English audience endure the Mirra, as to find an English actress who would exhibit herself in so revolting a part. * * * * * * Tuesday. \u2014 Our last day at Florence. I walked down to the San Lorenzo this morning early, and made a sketch of the sarcophagus of Lorenzo de' Medici. Afterwards we spent an hour in the gallery, and bid adieu to the Venus \u2014 \" 0 bella Venero ! Che sola sei, Piacer degli uomini E degli dei !\" When I went to lake a last look of Titian's Flora, I sound it removed from its station, and an artist employed in copying it. I could have envied Ihe lady for whom this copy was intended ; bul comforted my self with the conviction that no hireling dauber in water-colours could 4"], [62, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 50 do justice to the heavenly original, which only wants motion and speech to live indeed. We then spent nearly two hours in the Pitti Palace; and the court having lately removed to Pisa, we had an opportunity of seeing Canova's Venus, which is placed in one of the Grand Duke s private apartments. She stands in the centre of a small cabinet, pan- nelled wilh mirrors, which reflect her at once in every possible point of view. This statue was placed on the pedestal of the Venus de' Me- dicis during her forced residence at Paris; and is justly considered as the triumph of modern art : but though a most beautiful creature, she is not a goddess. I looked in vain for that full divinity, that ethereal something which breathes round the Venus of the Tribune. In an- other private room are two magnificent landscapes by Salvator Rosa. Every good calholic has a portrait of the Virgin hung'at the head of his bed ; partly as an object of devotion, and partly to scare away the powers of evil : and for this purpose the Grand Duke has suspended by his bed-side one of the most beautiful of Raffaelle's Madonas. Truly, I admire the good taste of his piety, though it is rather selfish thus to appropriate such a gem, when the merest daub would answer the same purpose. It was only by secret bribery I obtained a peep at this pic ture, as the room is not publicly shown. The lower classes at Florence are in general ill-looking ; nor have I seen one handsome woman since I came here. Their costume too is singularly unbecoming; but there is an airy cheerfulness and viva city in their countenances, and a civility in their manners which is pleasing to a stranger. I was surprised to see the women, even the servant girls, decorated with necklaces of real pearl of considerable beauty and value. On expressing my surprise at this to a shopkeeper's wife, she informed me lhat these necklaces are handed down as a kind of heir-loom from mother to daughter; and a young woman is consi dered as dowered who possesses a handsome chain of pearl. If she has no hope ofone in reversion, she buys out of her little earnings a pearl at a time, till she has completed a necklace. The style of swearing at Florence is peculiarly elegant and classical. I hear the vagabonds in the street adjuring Venus and Bacchus; and my shoemaker swore \" by the aspect of Diana,\" that he would not take less lhan ten pauls for what was worth about three ; \u2014 yet was the knave forsworn. JOURNEY TO ROME. SOFFRI E TACI. Ye empty shadows of unreal good !

December 8. \u2014 In beginning another volume, I feel almost inclined lo throw the last into Ihe fire ; as in writing it 1 have generally begun the record of one day by tearing away the half of what was written the day before : but though it contains much that I would rather forget, and some things written under the impression of pain, and sick and irritable feelings, I will not yet ungratefully destroy it. I have fre quently owed to my lillle Diary not amusement only, but consolation. It has gradually become not only the faithful depository of my recol lections, but the confidante of my feelings, and the sole witness of my tears. I know not if this be wise : but if it be folly, I have the com fort of knowing that a mere act of my will destroys for ever the record of my weakness ; and meantime a confidante whose mouth is sealed with a patent lock and key, and whom I can put out of existence in a single moment, is not dangerous; so, as Lord Byron elegantly expresses it, \" Here goes.\" We left Florence this morning ; and saw the sun rise upon a country so enchantingly beautiful, that I dare not trust myself to description : but I felt it, and still feel it \u2014 almost in my heart. The blue cloudless sky, the sun pouring his beams upon a land, which even in this wintry season smiles when others languish \u2014 the soft varied character of the scenery, comprising every species of natural beauty \u2014 the green slope, the woody hill, the sheltered valley, \u2014 lhe deep dales, into which we could just peep, as the carriage whirled us too rapidly by \u2014 the rugged fantastic rocks, cultivated plains, and sparkling rivers, and, beyond all, the chain of the Appenines with light clouds floating across them, or resting in their recesses \u2014 all this I saw, and felt, and shall not forget. I write this at Arezzo, the birth-place of Petrarch, of Redi, of Pig\u2014 notti, and of that Guido who discovered Counter-point. Whether Arezzo is remarkable for any thing else, I am too sleepy to recollect : and as we depart early to-morrow morning, it would only tantalize me to remember. We arrived here late, by the light of a most resplen dent moon. If such is this country in winter, what must it be in summer? 9th, at Perugia. \u2014 All the beauties of natural scenery have been combined with historical associations, to render cur journey of to-day most interesting ; and with a mind more at ease, nothing has beep \u2022) \u2022"], [64, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 52 wanting to render this one of the most delightful days I have spent abroad. At Corlona, Hannibal slept the night before the battle of Thrasymene. Soon after leaving this town on our left, we came in view of the lake, and the old tower on its banks. There is an ancient ruin on a high eminence to the left, which our postilion called the \" Forleressa di Annibale il Carthago.\" Further on, the Gualandra hills seem to circle round the lake ; and here was the scene of the battle. The channel of the Sanguinetto, which then ran red with the best blood of Rome and Carthage, was dry when we crossed it \u2014 \" And hooting boys might dry-shod pass, And gather pebbles from the naked ford.\" While we traversed the field of battle at a slow pace, V. who had his Livy in his pocket, read aloud his minute description of the engage ment; and we could immediately point out the different places men tioned by the historian. The whole valley and the hills around are now covered wilh olive woods; and from an olive tree which grew close to the edge of the lake, I snatched a branch as we passed by, and shall preserve it\u2014 an emblem of peace, from the theatre of slaughter. The whole landscape as we looked back upon it from a hill on this side of lhe Casa del Rano, was exceedingly beautiful. The lake seemed to slumber in the sunshine ; and Passignano jutting into the water, wilh its castellated buildings, the two little woody islands, and the undulat ing hills enclosing the whole, as if to shut it from lhe world, made it look like a scene fit only to be peopled by fancy's fairest creatons, if the remembrance of its blood-stained glories had not started up, to rob it of half its beauty. Mrs. R compared it to the lake of Geneva; but in my own mind, I would not admit the comparison. The lake of Geneva stands alone in its beauty ; for there the sublimest and the softest features of nature are united : there the wonderful, the wild, and the beautiful, blend in one mighty scene ; and love and heroism, poetry and genius, have combined to hallow its shores. The lake of Perugia is far more circumscribed : the scenery around it wants grandeur and extent; though so beautiful in itself, that if no comparison had been made, no want would have been suggested : and on the bloody field of Thrasymene I looked with curiosity and interest unmingled with pleasure. I have long survived my sympathy wilh the fighting heroes of antiquity. All this I thought as we slowly walked up the hill, but I was silent as usual : as Jaques says, \" I can think of as many matters as other men, but I praise God, and make no boast of it.\" We arrived here too late lo See any thing of the city. Dec. Kith, at Terni. \u2014 The ridiculous contre-temps we sometimes meet with would be mailer of amusement to me, if they did not affect"], [65, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 53 others. And in truth, as far as paying well, and scolding well, can go, it is impossible to travel more magnificently, more d la milor Anglais than we do : but there is no controlling fate ; and here, as our evil destinies will have it, a company of strolling actors had taken possession of the best quarters before our arrival ; and our accommo dations are, I must confess, tolerably bad. When we left Perugia this morning, the city, throned upon its lofty eminence, with its craggy rocks, its tremendous fortifications, and its massy gateways, had an imposing effect. Forwards, we looked over a valley, which so resembled a lake, the hills projecting above the glit tering white vapour having the appearance of islands scattered over ils surface, that at the first glance I was positively deceived ; and all my topographical knowledge, which I had conned on the map the night before, completely put to the rout. As the day advanced, this white mist sank gradually to the earth, like a veil dropped from the form of a beautiful woman, and nature stood disclosed in all her loveliness. Trevi, on its steep and craggy hill, detached from the chain of mountains, looked beautiful as we gazed up at it, with its buildings mingled wilh rocks and olives \u2014 I' had written thus far, when we were all obliged to decamp in haste to our respective bed-rooms ; as it is found necessary to convert our salon into a dormitory. I know I shall be tired, and very tired to-morrow, \u2014 therefore add a few words in pencil, before the impres sions now fresh on my mind are obscured. After Trevi came the Clilumnus with its little fairy temple ; and we left the carriage to view it from below, and drink of the classic stream. The temple (now a chapel) is not much in itself, and was voted in bad taste by some of our parly. To me the liny fane, the glassy river, more pure and limpid than any fabled or famous fountain of old, the beautiful hills, the sunshine, and the associations connected wilh the whole scene, were enchanting ; and I could not at the moment descend lo architectural criticism. The road to Spoleto was a succession of olive grounds, vineyards, and rich woods. The vines with- their skeleton boughs looked wintry and miserable ; but the olives, now in full fruit and foliage, intermixed wilh the cypress, the ilex, the cork tree, and the pine, clothed the landscape with a many-tinted robe of verdure. WTiile sitting in the open carriage at Spoleto, waiting for horses, I saw one of that magnificent breed of \" milk white steers,\" for which the banks of the Clitumnus have been famed from all antiquity, led past me gaily decorated, to be baited on a plain without the city. As the noble creature, \"serene and unresisting, paced along, followed by a wild, ferocious-looking, and far more brutal rabble, I would have given all I possessed to redeem him from his tormentors : but it was in"], [66, "54 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. vain. As we left the city, we heard his tremendous roar of agony and rage echo from the rocks. I stopped my ears, and was glad when we were whirled out of hearing. The impression left upon my nerves by this rencontre, makes me dislike to remember Spoleto : yet I believe it is a beautiful and interesting place. Hannibal, as I recollect, be sieged this city, but was bravely repulsed. I could say much more of the scenes and the feelings of to-day ; but my pencil refuses to mark another leiter. Dec. 11th, at Civita Castellana.\u2014i could not write a word to-night in the salon, because I wished to listen to the conversation of two in telligent travellers, who, arriving after us, were obliged to occupy tho same apartment. Our accommodations here are indeed deplorable altogether. After studying the geography of my bed, and finding no spot thereon, to which Sancho's couch of pack-saddles and pummels would not be a bed of down in comparison, I ordered a fresh faggot on my hearth : they brought me some ink in a gally-pot \u2014 invisible ink \u2014 for I cannot see what I am writing ; and I sit down to scribble, pour me de'sennuyer. This morning we set off to visit the Falls of Terni (la cascata di Marmore) in two carriages and sour : 0 such equipages ! \u2014 such rat like steeds ! such picturesque accoutrements ! and such poetical look ing guides and postilions, ragged, cloaked, and whiskered! \u2014 but it was all consistent : the wild figures harmonized with the wild land scape. We passed a singular fortress on the top of a steep insulated rock, which had formerly been inhabited by a band of robbers and their families, who were with great difficulty, and after a regular siege, dislodged by a party of soldiers, and the place dismantled. In its present ruined state, it has a very picturesque effect ; and though the presence of the banditti would no doubt have added greatly to the romance of the scene, on the present occasion we excused their absence. We visited the falls both above and below, but unfortunately we nei ther saw them from the best point of view, nor at the best season. The body of waters is sometimes ten times greater, as I was assured \u2014 but can scarce believe it possible. The words \"Hell of waters,\" used by Lord Byron, would not have occurred to me while looking at this'cataract, which impresses the astonished mind with an overwhelm ing idea of power, might, magnificence, and impetuosity ; but blends at the same time all that is most tremendous in sound and motion, with all that is most bright and lovely in forms, in colours, and in scenery. As 1 stood close to the edge of the precipice, immediately under lhe great fall, I felt my respiration gone : I turned giddy, almost faint, and"], [67, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 55 was obliged to lean against the rock for support. The mad plunge of the waters, the deafening roar, the presence of a power which no earthly force could resist or control, struck me with an awe almost amounting to terror. A bright sunbow stood over the torrent, which, seen from below, has the appearance of a luminous white arch bending from rock to rock. The whole scene was \u2014 but how can I say what it was ? I have exhausted my stock of fine words ; and must be con tent with silent recollections, and the sense of admiration and wonder unexpressed. Below the fall, an inundation which took place a year ago, under mined and carried away part of the banks of the Nera, at the same time laying open an ancient Roman bridge, which had been buried for ages. The channel of the river and the depth of the soil must have been greatly altered since this bridge was erected. When we returned to the inn at Terni, and while the horses were putting to, I took up a volume of Eustace's tour, which some traveller had accidentally left on the table ; and turning to the description of Terni, read part of it, but quickly threw down the book with indig- nation, deeming all his verbiage the merest nonsense I had ever met with : in fact, it is nonsense to attempt to imagein words an individual scene like this. When we had made out our description as accurately as possible, it would do as well for any other cataract in the world : we can only combine rocks, wood, and water, in certain proportions. A good picture may give a tolerable idea of a particular scene or land- scape : but no picture, no painter, not Ruysdael himself, can give a just idea of a cataract. The lifeless, silent, unmoving image is there : but where is the thundering roar, the terrible velocity, the glory of refracted light, lhe eternity of sound, and infinity of motion, in which essentially its effect consists ? In the valley beneath the Falls of Terni, there is a beautiful retired li tile villa, which was once occupied by the late Queen Caroline : and in the gardens adjoining it, we gathered oranges from the trees our selves for the first time. After passing Mount Soracte, of classical fame, we took leave of the Apennines; having lived amongst them ever since we left Bologna. The coslume of this part of the country is very gay and picturesque : the women wear a white head-dress formed of a square kerchief, which hangs down upon the shoulders, and is attached to the hair by a silver pin : a boddice half laced, and decorated with knots of ribbon, and a short scarlet petticoat complete their attire. Between Perugia and Terni I did not see one woman without a coral necklace ; and those who have the power, load themselves with trinkets and ornaments. Rome, December 12. \u2014 The morning broke upon us so beautifully between CivilaCaslellana and Nevi, that we lauded our good fortune,"], [68, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 56 and anticipated a glorious approach to the \" Eternal City.\" We were impatient to reach the heights of Baccano ; from which, at the distance of fifteen miles, we were to view the cross of St. Peter's glittering on the horizon, while the postilions rising in their stirrups, should point forward with exultation, and exclaim \"Roma!\" But, 0 vain hope ! who can controul their fate? just before we reached Baccano, impe netrable clouds enveloped the whole Campagna. The mist dissolved into a drizzling rain ; and when we entered the city, it poured in tor rents. Since we left England, this is only the third time it has rained while we were on the road ; it seems therefore unconscionable to mur mur. But to lose the first view of Rome ! the sirst view of the dome of St. Peter's ! no \u2014 that lost moment will never be retrieved through our whole existence. We found it difficult to obtain suitable accommodation for our nu merous cortege, lhe Hotel d'Europe, and the Hotel de Londres being quite full : and for the present we are rather indifferently lodged in the Albergo di Parigi. So here we are, in Rome ! where we have been for the last five hours, and have not seen an inch of the city beyond the dirty pave ment of the Via Santa Croce ; where an excellent dinner cooked a VAnglaise, a blazing sire, a drawing-room sungly carpeted and cur tained, and the rain beating against our windows, would almost per suade us that we are in London ; and every now and then, it is with a kind of surprise that I remind myself that I am really in Rome. Heaven send us but a sine day to-morrow 1 13. \u2014 The day arose as beautiful, as brilliant, as cloudless, as I could have desired for the sirst day in Rome. About seven o'clock, and before any one was ready for breakfast, I walked out ; and directing my steps by mere chance to the left, found myself in the Piazza di Spagna and opposite to a gigantic flight of marble stairs leading to the top of a hill. I was at the summit in a moment ; and breathless and agitated by a thousand feelings, I leaned against the obelisk, and looked over the whole city. I knew not where I was : nor among the crowded mass of buildings, the innumerable domes and towers, and vanes and pin nacles, brightened by the ascending sun, could I for a while distinguish a single known object; for my eyes and my heart were both too full: but in a few minutes my powers of perception returned ; and in the huge round bulk of the castle of St. Angelo, and the immense facade and soaring cupola of St. Peter's, I knew I could not be mistaken. I gazed and gazed as if I would have drunk it all in at my eyes : and then descending the superb flight of steps rather more leisurely lhan I had ascended, I was in a moment at the door of our hotel. The rest of lhe day I wish I could forget\u2014 I sound letters from England on the breakfasl table \u2014"], [69, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 57 Until dinner time were we driving through the narrow dirty streets at the mercy of a stupid laquais de place, in search of belter accom modations, but without success : and, on the whole, I fear I shall always remember too well the disagreeable and painful impressions of my sirst day in Rome. Dec. 18. \u2014 A week has now elapsed, and I begin to know and feel Rome a little better than I did. The sites of the various buildings, the situations of the most interesting objects, and the bearings of the prin cipal hills, the Capitol, the Palatine, the Aventine, and lhe \u00c6squiline, have become familiar to me, assisted in my perambulations by an ex cellent plan. I have been disappointed in nothing, for I expected that the general appeartance of modern Rome would be mean ; and lhat the impression made by the ancient city would be melancholy ; and I had been, unfortunately, too well prepared, by previous reading, sor all I see, to be astonished by any thing except the Museum of the Valican. I entered St. Peter's expecting to be struck dumb with admiration, and accordingly it was so. A feeling of vastness filled my whole mind, and made it disagreeable, almost impossible to speak or exclaim : but it was a style of grandeur, exciting rather than oppressive to the ima gination, nor did I experience any thing like that sombre and reve rential awe, I have felt on entering one of our Gothic minsters. The interior of St. Peter's is all airy magnificence, and gigantic splendour ; light andsunshine pouring in on every side ; gilding aud gay colours, marbles and pictures, dazzling the eye above, below, around. The effect of the whole has not diminished in a second and third visit; but rathers grows upon me. I can never utter a word for the first ten minutes after I enter the church. For the Museum of the Valican, I confess I was totally unprepared; and the first and second time I walked through the galleries, I was so amazed \u2014 so intoxicated, that I could not fix my attention upon any individual object, except the Apollo, upon which, as I walked along confused and lost in wonder and enchantment, I stumbled acciden tally, and stood spell-bound. Gallery beyond gallery, hall within hall, temple within temple, new splendours opening at every step ! of all the creations of luxurious art, the Museum of the Vatican may alone defy any description to do it justice, or any fancy to conceive lhe un imaginable variety of its treasures. When I remember lhat the French had the audacious and sacrilegious vanity to snatch from these glo rious sanctuaries the finest specimens of art, and hide them in their villanous old gloomy Louvre, I am confounded. I have been told and can well believe, that the whole giro of the galleries exceed two miles."], [70, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 58 I have not yet studied the frescos of Raffaelle sufficiently to feel all their perfection ; and should be in despair at my own dullness, were I not consoled by the recollection of Sir Joshua Reynolds. At present one of Raffaelle's divine Virgins delights me more than all his camere and logie together; but I can look upon them with due veneration, and grieve to see the ravages of time and damp. * * * * * 19.\u2014 Last night we took advantage of a brilliant full moon to visit the Coliseum by moonlight ; and if I came away disappointed of the pleasure I had expected, the fault was not in me nor in the scene around me. In its sublime and heart-stirring beauty, it more than equalled, it surpassed all I had anticipated\u2014 but \u2014 (there must always be a but t always in the realities of this world something to disgust ;) it happened that one or two gentlemen joined our party \u2014 young men too, and classical scholars, who perhaps thought it fine to affect a well bred nonchalance, a fashionable disdain for all romance and enthu siasm, and amused themselves with quizzing our guide, insulting the gloom, the grandeur, and the silence around them, with loud imper tinent laughter at their own poor jokes ; and I was obliged to listen, sad and disgusted, to their empty and tasteless and misplaced flippancy. The young barefooted friar, with his dark lanthorn, and his black eyes flashing from under his cowl, who acted as our cicerone, was in pictu resque unison with the scene ; but \u2014 more than one murder having lately been committed among the labyrinthine recesses of the ruin, the government has given orders that every person entering after dusk should be attended by a guard of two soldiers. These fellows there sore necessarily walked close after our heels, smoking, spitting, and spluttering German. Such were my companions, and such was my cortege. I returned home vowing that while I remained at Rome, nothing should induce me to visit the Coliseum by moonlight again. To-day I was standing before the Laocoon with Rogers, who re marked that the absenceof all parental feeling in the aspect of Laocoon, his self-engrossed indifference to the sufferings of his children (which is noticed and censured, I think, by Dr. Moore) adds to the pathos, if properly considered, by giving the strongest possible idea of that physi cal agony which the sculptor intended to represent. It may be so, and I thought there was both truth and tacte in the poet's observation. The Perseus of Canova does not please me so well as his Paris ; there is more simplicity and repose in the latter statue, less of lhat theatrical air which I think is the common fault of Canova's figures. It is absolutely necessary to look at the Perseus before you look at the Apollo, in order lo do the former justice. I have gazed with admira tion at the Perseus for minutes together, then walked from it to the A polio and felt instantaneously, but could not have expressed, the difference."], [71, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 59 The first is indeed a beautiful statue, the latter \"breathes the flame wilh which 'twas wrought,\" as if the sculptor had left a portion of his own soul within the marble to half animate his glorious creation. The want of this informing life is strongly felt in the Perseus, when con templated after the Apollo. It is delightful when the imagination rises in the scale of admiralion, when we ascend from excellence to perfec tion : but excellence after perfection is absolute inferiority ; it sinks below itself, and the descent is so disagreeable and disappointing, that we can seldom estimate justly the object before us. We make compa risons involuntarily in a case where comparisons are odious. The weather is cold here during the prevalence of the tramontana : but I enjoy the brilliant skies and the delicious purity ofthe air, which leaves the eye free to wander over a vast exlentof space. Looking from the gallery oftheRelvedere at sunset this evening, I clearly saw Tivoli, Albano, and Frascati, although all Rome and part of the Campagna lay between me and those towns. The outlines of every building, ruin, hill, and wood were so distinctly marked, and stood out so brightly to the eye! and the full round moon, magnified through the purple vapour which floated over the Appenines, rose just over Tivoli, adding to the beauty of the scene. 0 Italy 1 how I wish I could transport hither all I love ! how I wish I were well enough, happy enough, to enjoy all the lovely things I see ! but pain is mingled with all I behold, all I feel : a cloud seems for ever before my eyes, a weight for ever presses down my heart. I know it is wrong to repine : and that I ought rather to be thankful for the pleasurable sensations yet spared to me, than lament that they are so few. When I take up my pen to record the impressions ofthe day, I sometimes turn within myself, and won- der how it is possible that amid the strife of feelings not all subdued, and the desponding of the heart, the mind should still retain its facul- ties unobscured, and the imagination all ils vivacity and its suscepti bility to pleasure, \u2014 like the beautiful sunbow I saw at the Falls of Terni, bending so bright and so calm over the verge of the abyss which toiled and raged below. _ ****** 22. \u2014 This morning was devoted to the Capitol, where the objects of art are ill arranged and too crowded : the lights are not well man aged, and on the whole I could not help wishing, in spite of my veneration for the Capitol, that some at least among the divine master-pieces it contains could be transferred to the glorious halls of the Valican, and shrined in temples worthy of them. The objects which most struck me were the dying Gladiator, the Antinous, the Flora, and the statue called (I know not on what authority) the Faun of Praxiteles."], [72, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 60 ' The dying Gladiator is the chief boast of the Capitol. The anti- quarian Nibby insists lhat this statue represents'a Gaul, that the sculpture is Grecian, that it formed part of a group on a pediment, represent- ing the vengeance which Apollo took on the Gauls, when, under their king Brennus, they attacked the temple of Delphi : lhat the cord round the neck is a twisted chain, an ornament peculiar to the Gauls ; and that the form of the shield, the bugles, the style of the hair, and the mustachios, all prove it to be a Gaul. I asked, \" why should such faultless, such exquisite sculpture be thrown away upon a high pedi- ment?\" the affecting expression of the countenance, the head ' bowed low and full of death,' the gradual failure ofthe strength and sinking of the form, the blood slowly trickling from his side \u2014 how could any spectator, contemplating it at a vast height, be sensible of these mi- nute trails\u2014 the distinguishing perfections of this matchless statue?\" It was replied, that many of the ancient buildings were so constructed, that it was possible to ascend and examine the sculpture above the cornice, and though some statues so placed were unfinished at the back, (for instance, some of the figures which belonged to the group of Niobe,) others (and he mentioned the \u00c6gina marbles as an example) were as highly finished behind as before. I owned myself unwilling to cout sider the Gladiator a Gaul, but the reasoning struck me, and I am too unlearned to weigh the arguments he used, much less confute them. That the statue being of Grecian marble and Grecian sculpture must therefore have come from Greece, does not appear a conclusive argu- ment, since the Romans commonly employed Greek artists : and as to the rest of the argument, \u2014 suppose that in a dozen centuries hence, the charming statue of Lady Louisa Russel should be discovered under the ruins of Woburn Abbey, and lhat by a parity of reasoning, the production of Chanlrey's chisel should be attributed to Italy and Ca nova, merely because it is cut from a block of Carrara marble? we might smile at such a conclusion. Among the pictures in the gallery of the Capitol, the one most highly valued pleases me least of all \u2014 the Europa of Paul Veronese. The splendid colouring and copious fancy of this master can never recon cile me to his strange anomalies in co'mpdfttion, and his sins against good taste and propriety. One wishes that he had allayed the heat of his fancy with some cooling drops of discretion. Even his colouring so admired in general, has something florid and meretricious to my eye and taste. One of the finest pictures here is Domcnichino's Cumean Sibyl, which, like all other masterpieces, defies lhe copyist and engraver. The Sibilla Persica of Guercino hangs a little lo the left ; and with her contemplative air, and the pen in her hand, she looks as if she were recording the effusions of her more inspired sister. The former"], [73, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 61 is a chaste and beautiful picture, full of feeling and sweetly coloured ; but the vicinity ofDomenichino's magnificent creation throws it rather into shade. Two unfinished pictures upon which Guido was employed at the time of his death are preserved in the Capitol : one is the Bac chus and Ariadne, so often engraved and copied ; the other, a single figure, the sizeof life, represents theSoul of the righteous man ascending to heaven. Had Guido lived to finish this divine picture, it would have been one of his most splendid productions ; but he was snatched away lo realize, I trust, in his own person, his sublime conception. The head alone is finished, or nearly so ; and has a most exlalic expression. The globe of the earth seems to sink from beneath the floating figure, which is just sketched upon the canvass, and has a shadowy indistinct ness which to my fancy added to its effect. Guercino's chef-d'oeuvre, the Besurrection of Saint Petronilla, (a saint, I believe, of very hypo thetical fame,) is also here; and has been copied in mosaic for St. Peters. A magnificent Rubens, the She Wolf nursing Romulus and Remus ; a sine copy of Raffaelle's Triumph of Galatea by Giulo Roma no; Domenichino's Saint Barbara, with the same lovely inspired eyes he always gives his female saints, and a long el cetera. From the Capitol we immediately drove to the Borghese palace, where I spent half an hour looking at the picture called the Cumean Sibyl of Domenichino, and am more and more convinced that it is a Saint Cecilia and not a Sibyl. We have now visited the Borghese palace four times ; and a-propos lo pictures, I may as well make a few memoranda of its contents. It is not the most numerous, but it is by far the most valuable and select private gallery in Rome. Domenichino's Chase of Diana, with the two beautiful nymphs in the foreground, is a splendid picture. Titian's Sacred and Profane Love puzzles me completely : I neither understand the name nor the intention of the picture. It is evidently allegorical : but an allegory very clumsily expressed. The aspect of Sacred Love would answer just as well for Profane Love. What is that little cupid about, who is groping in the cistern behind ? why does Profane Love wear gloves ? The picture, though so provokingly obscure in ils subject, is most di vinely painted. The three Graces by the same master is also here ; two heads by Giorgione, distinguished by all his peculiar depth of cha racter and sentiment, some exquisite Albanos ; one of Raffaelle's finest portraits \u2014 and in short, an endless variety of excellence. I feel my taste become more and more fastidious every day. This morning we heard mass al the Pope's Chapel ; the service was read by Cardinal Fesche, and the venerable old pope himself, robed and mitred en grand costume, was present. No females are allowed"], [74, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 62 to enter without veils, and we were very ungallantly shut up behind a sort of grating, where, though we had a tolerable view of the cere monial going forward, it was scarcely possible for us to be seen. Cardinal Gonsalvi sat so near us, that I had leisure and opportunity to contemplate the fine intellectual head and acute features of this re markable man. I thought his countenance had something of the Wel lesley cast. The Pope's Chapel is decorated in the most exquisite taste ; splendid at once and chaste. There are no colours\u2014 the whole interior being white and gold. At an unfortunate moment, Lady Morgan's ludicrous description of the twisting and untwisting of the Cardinal's tails came across me, and made me smile very mal apropos: it is certainly from the life. Whenever this lively and clever woman describes what she has ac tually seen with her own eyes, she is as accurately true as she is witty and entertaining. Her sketches after nature are admirable ; but her observations and inferences are coloured by her peculiar and ralher unfeminine habits of thinking. I never read her \" Italy\" till the other day, when L., whose valet had contrived to smuggle it into Rome, offered to lend it to me. It is one of the books most rigorously pro scribed here ; and if the Padre Anfossi or any of his satellites had discovered it in my hands, I should assuredly have been fined in a sum beyond what I should have liked to pay. We concluded the morning at St. Peter's, where we arrived in time for the anthem. 23. \u2014 Our visit to the Barberini palace to-day was solely to view the famous portrait of Beatrice Cenci. Her appalling story is still as fresh in remembrance here, and her name and fate as familiar in the mouths of every class, as if instead of two centuries, she had lived two days ago. In spile of the innumerable copies and prints I have seen, I was more struck than I can express by the dying beauty of the Cenci. In the face the expression of heart-sinking anguish and terror is just not too strong, leaving the loveliness of the countenance unimpaired ; and there is a woe-begone negligence in the streaming hair and loose drapery which adds to its deep pathos. It is consistent too with lhe circumstances under which the picture is traditionally said to have been painted \u2014 lhat is, in the interval between her torture and her execution. A little daughter of the Princess Barberini was seated in lhe same room, knitting. She was a beautiful little creature ; and as my eye glanced from her to the picture and back again, I fancied I could trace a strong family resemblance ; particularly about the eyes, and the veiy peculiar moulh. I turned back to ask her whether she had ever been"], [75, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 63 told that she was like that picture? pointing lo Cenci. She shook back her long curls, and answered with a blush and a smile, \" Yes, often.\"* The Barberini Palace contains other treasures beside the Cenci. Poussin's celebrated picture of the Death of Germanicus, Baffaelle's Fornarina.'inferiorl thought to the one at Florence, and a St. Andrew by Guido, in his very best style of heads, \" mild, pale, and penetrat ing; \" besides others which I cannot at this moment recall. 2h. \u2014 Yesterday, after chapel, I walked through part of the Vatican ; and then, about vesper-time, entered St. Peter's, expecting to hear the anthem : but I was disappointed. I found the church as usual crowded with English, who every Sunday convert St. Peter's into a kind ol Hyde Park, where they promenade arm in arm, show off their finery, laugh, and talk aloud : as if the size and splendour of the edifice de tracted in any degree from its sacred character. I was struck with a seeling of disgust ; and shocked to see this most glorious temple of the Deity metamorphosed into a mere theatre. Mr. W. told me this morn ing, that in consequence of the shameful conduct of the English, in pressing in and out of the chapel, occupying all the seats, irreverently interrupting the service, and almost excluding the natives, the anthem will not be sung in future. This is not the first time that the behaviour of the English has created offence, in spite of the friendly feeling which exists towards us, and the allowances which are made for our national character. Last year the pope objected to the indecent custom of making St. Peter's a place of fashionable rendezvous, and notified to Cardinal Gonsalvi his desire that English ladies and gentlemen should not be seen arm in arm walking up and down the aisles, during and after divine service. The cardinal, as the best means of proceeding, spoke to the Duchess of Devonshire, who signified the wishes of the Papal Court to a large party, assembled at her house. The hint so judiciously and so delicately given, was at the time attended to, and during a short interval the offence complained of ceased. New comers have since recommenced the same course of conduct : and in fact, nothing could be worse than the exhibition of gaiety and frivolity, gallantry and coquetterie at St. Peter's yesterday. I almost wish the pope may in terfere, and with rigour; though, individually, I should lose a high gratification, if our visits to St. Peter's were interdicted. It is surely * The family of the Cenci was a branch ofthe house of'Colonna, now extinot in the direct male line. The last Prince Colonna, left two daughters, co-heiresses, of whom one married the Prince Sciarra, and the other the Prince Barberini. In this manner the portrait of Beatrice Cenci came into the Barberini samUy. The au thenticity of this interesting picture has been disputed : but last night after hearing the point extremely well contested by two intelligent men, 1 remained convinced of its authenticity. j"], [76, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 64 most ill-judged and unfeeling (to say nothing of the profanation, for such it is), to show such open contempt for the Boman Catholic religion in its holiest, grandest temple, and under the very eyes of the head of that church. I blushed for my countrywomen. * * * * * * * On Christmas Eve we went in a large party lo visit some of the principal churches, and witness the celebration of the Nativity; one of the most splendid ceremonies of the Bomish Church. We arrived at the chapel of Monte Cavallo about half-past nine ; but the pope being ill and absent, nothing particular was going forward ; and we left it to proceed to the San Luigi dei Francesi, where we found the church hung from the floor to the ceiling with garlands of flowers, blazing with light, and resounding with heavenly music : but the crowd was intolerable, the people dirty, and there was such an effluence of strong perfumes, in which garlic predominated, that our physical sensations overcame our curiosity : and we were glad to make our escape. We then proceeded to the church of the Ara Celi, built on the site of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and partly from its ruins. The scene here from the gloomy grandeur and situation ofthe church, was exceedingly fine : but we did not stay long enough to see the concluding procession, as we were told it would be much finer at the Santa Maria Maggiore; for there the real manger which had received our Saviour at his birth was deposited : and this inestimable relic wras to be displayed to the eyes of the devout ; and with a waxen figure laid within (called here 11 Bambino), was to be carried in pro cession round the church, \"with pomp, withmusic, and with triumph- ing.\" The real cradle was a temptation not to be withstood : and to witness this signal prostration of the human intellect before ignorant and crafty superstition, we adjourned to the Santa Maria Maggiore. For processions and shows I care very little, but not for any thing, not for all I suffered at the moment, would I have missed the scene which the interior of the church exhibited ; sor it is impossible that any description could have given me the faintest idea ofit. This most noble edifice, with its perfect proportions, its elegant Ionic columns, and its majestic simplicity, appeared transformed, for the time being, into the temple of some Pagan divinity. Lights and flowers, incense and music, were all around : and the spacious aisles were crowded wilh the lowest classes of the people, the inhabitants of the neighbouring hills, and the peasantry ofthe Campagna, who wilh their wild ruffian like figures and picturesque costumes, were lounging about, or seated at the bases of pillars, or praying before the altars. How I wished to paint some of the groups I saw ! but only Rembrandt could have done them justice."], [77, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 65 We remained at lhe Santa Maria Maggiore till four o'clock, and no procession appearing, our patience was exhausted. I nearly fainted on my chair from excessive fatigue; and some of our parly had absolutely laid themselves down on the steps of an altar, and were fast asleep; we therefore returned home completely knocked up by the night's dissipation. 27.^\" Come,\" said L. just now, as he drew his chair to the sire, and rubbed his hands with great complacency, ' ' I think we've worked pretty hard to-day ; three palaces, four churches \u2014 besides odds and ends of ruins we dispatched in the way : to say nothing of old Nibby's lectures in the morning about lhe Voices, lhe Saturnines, the Albanians, and the other old Romans \u2014 by Jove ! I almost fancied myself at school again \" Armis vitrumque canter,\" as old Virgil or somebody else says. So now let's have a little ecarle to put it? 1 out of our heads : \u2014 for my brains have turned round like a wii-dmi i, by Jove ! ever since I was on the top of that cursed steeple on the ca itol,\" etc., etc. I make a resolution to myself every morning before breakfast, that I will be prepared with a decent stock of good-nature and forbearance, and not laugh at my friend L.'s absurdities; but in vain are my amiable intentions: his blunders and his follies surpass all anticipation, as they defy all powers of gravity. I console myself with the con viction that such is his slowness of perception, he does not see lhat he is the butt of every party ; and such his obtuseness of seeling, that if he did see it, he would not mind it; bul he is the heir lo twenty-five thousand a year, and therefore, as R. said, he can afford to be laughed at. We \"dispatched,\" as L. says, a good deal to-day, (hough I did not \" work quite so hard\" as the rest of the parly : in fact* I was obliged to return home from fatigue, after having visited the Doria and Sciarra Palaces (the last for the second time), and the church of San Pietro in Vincoli. The Doria Palace contains the largest collection of pictures in Rome : but they are in a dirty and neglected condition, and many of the best are hung in lhe worst possible light : added to Ihis there is such a number of bad and indifferent pictures, lhat one ought to visit the Doria Gallery half a dozen limes merely to select those on which a cultivated taste would dwell wilh pleasure. Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Joanna of Naples, is considered one of the most valuable pictures in the collection. It exhibits the same cast of countenance which prevails through all his female heads, a sort of sentimental simpering affectation which is very disagreeable, and not at all con- 3"], [78, "HIV!.! OB AN li\\M 'i 13\". 66 sislcnt with the character of Joanna. I was intich more delighted by some magnificent portraits by Titian and Rubens ; and by a copy of Ihe famous antique picture, the Nozze Aldobrandini, executed in a kindred spirit by the classic pencil of Poussin. The collection at the Sciarra Palace is small but very select. The pictures are hung with judgment, and well te.ken care of. Tho Magdalen, which is considered one of Guido's masterpieces, charmed me most: the countenance is heavenly; though full of ecstatic and de vout contemplation, Ihere is in it a touch of melancholy, ' ' all sorrow's softness charmed from its despair,\" which is quite exquisite: and lhe altitude, and particularly the turn of the arm, are perfectly graceful: but why those odious turnips and carrots in the foreground ? They certainly do not add to the sentiment and beauty of the picture- Leonardo da Vinci's Vanity and Modesty, and Caravaggio's Gamblers, both celebrated pictures in very different styles, are in Ihis colleclion. I ought not lo forget Raffaelle's beautiful portrait of a young musician who was his intimate friend. The Doria and Sciarra palaces contain Ihe only Claudes I have seen in Rome. Since lhe acquisition of the Altieri Claudes, we may boast of possessing the finest productions of this master in England. I remember but one solitary Claude in the Florentine gallery ; and I see none here equal lo those at Lord Gros venor's and Angerstcin's. We visited lhe church of San Pietro in Vineoli, lo see Michel Angelo's famous statue of Moses, \u2014 of which, who has not heard? I must confess I never was so disappointed by any work of art as I was by Ihis statue, which is easily accounted for. In the first place, I had not seen any model or copy of the original; and, secondly, I had read Zappi's sublime sonnet, which I humbly conceive does rather more than justice to its subject. The sine opening \u2014 \u2022 \" Chi e costui che in dura pietra scolto Siede Gigante \" \u2014 gave me lhe impression ofa colossal and elevated figure : my surprise, therefore, was great lo see a silting statue, not much larger than life, and placed nearly on the level of lhe pavement ; so that, instead of looking up at it, I almost looked down upon it. The \"Doppio raggio in fronte,\" I found in the shape or a pair of horns, which, at lhe first glance, gave something quite Satanic to the head, which disgusted me. When I began to recover from this first disappointment \u2014 although my eyes were opened gradually lo lhe sublimity of the altitude, the grand forms of the d.-apery, and the lips, which unclose as if about lo speak \u2014 I slill think that Zappi's sonnet (his acknowledged chef d'\u0153uvre) is a more sublime production lhan Ihe chef-d'oeuvre it celebrates. The mention ofZ.ippi reminds me of his wife, the daughter of Carlo"], [79, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 67 Maratti, the painter. She was so beautiful that she was her father's favourite model for his Nymphs, Madonnas, and Vestal Virgins ; and to her charms she added virtue, and to her virtue uncommon musical and literary talents. Among her poems, there is a sonnet addressed to a lady, once beloved by her husband, beginning \" Donna! che tanto al mio sol piacesti,\" which is one of the most graceful, most feeling, most delicate compo sitions I ever read. Zappi celebrates his beautiful wife under the name of Clori, and his first mistress under lhat of Filli : lo the latter he has addressed a sonnet, which turns on the same thought as Cowley's well known song, \" Love in thine eyes.\" As they both lived about tho same time, it would be difficult lo tell which of the two borrowed from the olher ; probably they were both borrowers from some elder poet. The characteristics of Zappi's style, are tenderness and elegance; he occasionally rises to sublimity ; as in the sonnet on the Statue of Moses, and lhat on Good Friday. He never emulates the flights of Guido or Filicaja, but he is more uniformly graceful and flowing than either; his happy thoughts are not spun out too far, \u2014 and hispoints are seldom mere concetti.

After admiring lhe view from lhe summit of the pillar, we went on towards the Capitol, which presented a singular scene: lhe square and street in front, as well as the immense flight of steps, one hundred and fifty in number, which lead to the church of lhe Ara Celi, were crowded with men, women, and children, all in their holiday dresses. It was with difficulty we made our way through them, Ihough they very civilly made way for us, and we were nearly a quarter of au hour mounting the steps, so dense was the multitude ascending and descending, some on their hands and knees out of extra-devotion. At last we reached the door of Ihe church, where we understood, from lhe exclamations andgesliculalions of those of whom weinquired, some- thing extraordinary was lo be seen. On one side of lhe entrance was a puppet show, on the oilier a band of musicians, playing \" Di tanti palpali.\" The interior of the church was crowded lo suffocation ; and all in darkness, except the upper end, where upon a stage brilliantly and very artisicially lighted by unseen lamps, there was an exhibition in wax-work, as large as life, of the Adoration of the Shepherds. The Virgin was habited in the court dress of the last century, as rich as silk and salin, gold lace, and paste diamonds could make it, wilh a flaxen wig, and high-heeled shoes. The infant Saviour lay inherlap, his head encircled wilh rays of gilt wire, at least two yards long. The shepherds were very well done, but the sheep and dogs best of all; I believe they were the real animals stuffed. There was a distant land scape, seen between the pasteboard trees, which was well painted, and from the artful disposition of the lighl and perspective, was almost a deception \u2014 but by a blunder very consistent with the rest of the show, it represented a part of lhe Campagna of Borne. Above all was a pro fane representation of that Being, whom I dare scarcely allude to, in conjunction with such preposterous vanities, encircled with saints, angels, and clouds ; the whole got up very like a scene in a pantomime, Love is in every glancr\u2014 Love taught her song And if she weep, or scorn contract her brow ' Still Love departs not from her, but is seen ' Even in her lovely anger anil her tears. When, in tbe mazy dance she glides along Still Love is near to poize each graceful step : So breathes the zephyr o'er the yielding flower.

In front of the stage there was a narrow passage divided off, admitting one person at a time, through which a continued site of persons moved along, who threw down Iheir contributions as they passed, bowing and crossing themselves with great devotion. It would be impossible lo describe the ecstasies of the multitude, the lifi ing up of hands and eyes, the string of superlatives \u2014 the bellissimop, santissimos, gloriosissimos, and maravigliosissimos, with which they expressed their applause and delight. I stood in Ihe back-ground of this strange scene, supported on one of the long-legged chairs which V\u2014 placed for me against a pillar, at once amazed, diverted, and dis gusted by this display of profaneness and superstition, till the heat and crowd overcame me, and I was obliged lo leave the church. I shall never certainly forget lhe \"Bambino'' of the Ara Celi : for though lhe exhibition I saw afterwards at the San Luigi (where I went lo look at Domenichino's fine pictures) surpassed what I have just described, it did not so much surprise me. Something in the same style is ex hibited in almost every church, between Christmas day and lhe Epiphany. During our examination of Trajan's Forum to-day, I learnt nothing new, except that Trajan levelled part of the Quirinal lo make room for it. The ground having lately been cleared to lhe depth of about twelve feet, part of lhe ancient pavement has been discovered, and many fragments of columns set upright : pieces of frieze and broken capitals are scattered about. The pillar, which is now cleared lo the base, stands in its original place, but not, as it is supposed, al ils ori ginal level, for lhe Romans generally raised the substructure of iheir buildings, in order to give them a more commandingappearance. The antiquarians here are of opinion that both the pavement of the Basilica and Ihe base of the pillar were raised above the level of the ancient street, and that there is a flight of steps, still concealed, between lhe pillar and lhe pavement in front. The famous Ulpian Library was on each sideof the Basilica, and the Forum differed from olherForums in nol being an open space surrounded by buildings, but a building surrounded by an open space.

Would lo heaven that as tho latest minutes now ebb away while I write, memory might also pass away ! Would lo heaven that I oould efface the last year from the series of time, hide it from myself, bury it in oblivion, stamp it into annihilation, that none of its dreary moments might ever rise up again to haunt me, like spectres of pain and dismay !

That great Being, lo whom lhe life of a human creature is a mere point, but who has be stowed on his creatures such capacities of feeling and suffering, as ex tend moments to hours and days to years, inflicts nothing in vain, and if I have suffered much, I have also learned much. Now the last hour is past \u2014 another year opens ; may it bring to those I love all I wish them in my heart 1 to me it can bring nothing.

Jan. h. \u2014 We dispatched, as L\" would say, a good deal to-day : we visited the Temple of Vesta, the Church of Santa Maria in Cos madino, the Temple of Fortune, the Ponte Rotlo, and the house of Nicolo Rienzi : all these lie together in a dirty, low, and disagreeable part of Rome. Thence we drove to the Pyramid of Caius Cestus. \u2014 As we know nothing of Ihis Caius Cestus, but that he lived, died, and was buried, it is not possible to attach any fanciful or classical interest to his tomb, but it is an object of so much beauty in itself, and from ils situation so striking and picturesque, that it needs no additional interest. Il is close to the ancient walls of Rome, which stretch on either sideas far as the eye can reach in huge and broken masses of brick-work, fragments of battlements and buttresses, overgrown in many parts wilh shrubs and even trees. Around the base of the Pyramid lies the burying-ground of strangers and heretics. Many of the monuments are elegant, and their frail materials and diminutive forms are in af fecting contrast with the lofty and solid pile which lowers above Ihem. The tombs lie around in a small space ' ' amicably close,\" like brothers in exile, and as I gazed I fell a kindred feeling wilh all ; for I, too, am a wanderer, a stranger and a heretic ; and it is probable that my place of rest may be among them. Be it so 1 for melhinks this earth could not afford a more lovely, a more tranquil, or more sacred spot. I re marked one tomb, which is an exact model, and in the same material wilh the sarcophagus of Cornelius Scipio, in the Valican. One small slab of white marble bore the name of a young girl, an only child, who died at sixteen, and \" left her parents disconsolate :\" another elegant"], [83, "DIAliY OF AN ENNUYEE. 71 and simple monument bore the name of a young painter of genius and promise, and was erected \" by his companions and fellow students as a testimony of their affectionate admiration and regret.\" This part ot old Rome is beautiful beyond description, and has a wild, desolate. and poetical grandeur, which affects the imagination like a dream. \u2014 The very air disposes one lo reverie. I am not surprised that Pous-. sin, Claude, and Salvator Rosa made this part of Rome a favourite haunt, and studied here their finest effects of colour, and Iheir grandest combinations of landscape. I saw a young artist seated on a pile of ruins wilh his sketch book open on his knee, and his pencil in his hand \u2014 during the whole time we were there he never changed his at lilude, nor put his pencil to the paper, but remained leaning ou his el bow, like one lost in ecstasy. Jan h. \u2014 To-day we drove through the quarter of the Jews, called the Ghella degli Ebrei. It is a long street enclosed at each end wilh a strong iron gale, which is locked by the police at a certain hour every evening (1 believe al ten o'clock) ; and any Jew found without ils precincts after lhat lime, is liable to punishment anda heavy sine. The street is narrow and dirly, the houses wretched and ruinous, and the appearance of lhe inhabitants squalid, filthy, and miserable \u2014 on tho whole, it was a painful scene, and one 1 should have avoided, had 1 followed my own inclinations. If this specimen of the effects of su perstition and ignorance was depressing, the next was not less ridicu lous. We drove lo the Lateran : I had frequently visited this nob'.o Basilica before, but on the present occasion we were to go over it in form, with lhe usual torments of laquaisand ciceroni. I saw nothing new but the cloisters, which remain exactly as in the lime of Conslan tine. They are in the very vilest style of architecture, and decorated wilh. Mosaic in a very elaborate manner : bul what most amused us was the collection of relics, said to have been brought by Constantine from the Holy Land, and which our cicerone exhihited wilh a sneer ing solemnity which made it very doubtful whether he believed him self in their miraculous sanctity. Here is Ihe stone on which the cock was perched when it crowed lo St. Peter, and a pillar from lhe Temple of Jerusalem, split asunder al the time of the crucifixion ; il looks as if il had been sawed very accurately in lulf from lop to bottom ; but this of course only renders it more miraculous. Here is also lhe column in front of Pilate's house, lo which our Saviour was bound, and lhe very well where he met lhe woman of Samaria. All these, and various other relics, supposed lo he consecrated by our Saviour's Passion, are carelessly thrown inlo the cloisters\u2014 not so lhe heads of St. Peter and St. Paul, wfcich are considered as the chief treasure, in the Lateran, and are deposited in the body of the church in a rich -htine.

The bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which stands on Ihe Capitol, was dug from the cloisters of the Lateran. The statue of Constantine in the portico was found in the baths of Constantine : it is in a style of sculpture worthy the architecture of the cloisters.\u2014 Constanline was Ihe first Christian emperor, a glory which has served to cover a multitude of sins ; it is indeed impossible to forget that he was the chosen instrument of a great and blessed revolution; but in other respects it is as impossible to look back to the period of Constan tine without horror\u2014 an era when bloodshed and barbarism, and the general depravity of morals and taste seemed to have reached their climax. On leaving the Laleran, we walked to the Scala Santa, said lo be the very flights of steps which led to the judgment hall at Jerusalem, and transported hither by the Emperor Constantine; but while the oilier relics which his pious benevolence bestowed on the city of Rome have apparently lost some of their efficacy, the Scala Santa is still re garded with the most devout veneration. At Ihe moment of our ap proach, an elegant barouche drove up to the portico, from which two well-dressed women alighted, and pulling out their rosaries, began to crawl up the steps on their hands and knees, repeating a Paternoster and an Ave Maria on every step. A poor diseased beggar had just gone up before them, and was a few steps in advance. This exercise, as we are assured, purchases a thousand years of indulgence. The morning was concluded by a walk on the Mont Pincio. I did not know on that first morning after our arrival, when I ran up the Scalla della Trinita to the top ofthe Pincian hill, and looked around me with such transport, that I stood by mere chance on that very spot from which Claude used to study his sun sets, and his beau tiful effects of evening. His house was close to me on the left, and those of Nicolo Poussin and Salvator Rosa a little beyond. Since they have been pointed out to me, I never pass from the Monte Pincio along the Via Felice without looking up at them with interest : such power has genius, \" to hallow in the core of human hearts even Ihe ruin of a wall.\" Jan. 6. \u2014 Sunday, at the English chapel, which was crowded to ex cess, and where it was at once cold and suffocating. We had a plain but excellent sermon, and the officiating clergyman, Mr. W. exhorted the congregation to conduct themselves with more decorum at St. Peter's, and to remember what was due lo the temple of that God who was equally the God of all Christians. We afterwards went to St. Peter's ; where the anthem was performed at vespers as usual, and"], [85, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 73 the tenor of the Argcnlino sung. The music was indeed heavenly hut I did nol enjoy it : for though the behaviour of the English was much more decent than I have yet seen it, the crowd round Ihe cha pel, the talking, pushing, whispering, and movement, were enough to disquiet and discomfort me: I withdrew, therefore, and walked about al a little distance, where I could just hear the swell of the organ. Such is the immensity of the building, that at the other side of the aisle the music is perfectly inaudible. 7. \u2014 Visited the Falconieri Palace to see Cardinal Fesche's gallery. The collection is large and contains many sine pictures, but there is such a melange of good, bad, and indifferent, that on the whole I was disappointed.

In one devoted heart I reign, And what is all the rest below ? 9.\u2014 We have had two days of truly English weather; cold, damp, and gloomy, wilh storms of wind and rain. I know not why, but there is something peculiarly deforming and discordant in bad weather here ; and we are all rather stupid and depressed. To me, sunshine and warmth are substitutes for health and spirits ; and their absence inflicts positive suffering. There is not a single room in our pajaz zello which is weather-proof ; and as to a good sire, it is a luxury un known, but not unnecessary, in these regions. In such apartments as contain no fire-place, a stufa, or portable stove, is set, which diffuses little warmth, and renders the air insupportably close and suffocating. I witnessed a scene last night, which was a good illustration of that extraordinary indolence for which the Romans are remarkable. Our laquais Camillo suffered himself to be turned off rather than put wood on the fire three times a-day; he would ralher, he said, \" starve in the streets than break his back by carrying burdens like an ass ; and ihough he was miserable to displease the Onoratissimo Padrone, his first duty was lo take care of his own health, which, wilh the blessing of Ihe saints, he was determined lo do.\" 11 threw him his wages, repeating wilh great contempt the only word of his long speech he un derstood, \" Asimo!\" \" Sono Romano, io,\" replied the fellow, draw ing himself up with dignity. He look his wages, however, and marched out of the house. The impertinence of this Camillo was sometimes amusing, but of tener provoking. He piqued himself on being a profound antiquarian, would confute Nibby, and carried Nardini in his pocket, to whom he referred on all occasions : yet the other day he had the impudence to assure us that Caius Cestus was an English Protestant, who was excom municated by Pope Julius C\u00e6sar ; and took his Nardini out of his poekel to prove his assertion. V broughlme to-day the \" Souvenirs de Felicie,\" ofMadamedy Genlis, which amused me delightfully for a few hours. They contain many truths, many half or whole falsehoods, many impertinent things, and several very interesting anecdotes. They are written with all (he graceful simplicity of style, and in that lone of lady-like seeling which distinguishes whatever she writes : but it is clear that though she repre sents these \"Souvenirs\" as mere extracts from her journal, they have been carefully composed or re-composed for publication, and were al ways intended lo be seen* Now if my poor little Diary should ever be seen !

Such strange \\_cissiludes of temper \u2014 such opposite ex tremes of thinking and feeling, written down at the moment, without noticing the intervening links of circumstances and impressions which led lo them, would appear like dclraclion, if they should meet the eye of any indifferent person \u2014 but I think I have taken sufficient precau tions against Ihe possibility of such an exposure, and the only eyes which will ever glance over this blolled page, when Ihe hand lhat writes it is cold, will read, not to criticise, but lo sympathise. 10. \u2014 A lovely brilliant day, the sky without a cloud and the air as soflas summer. The carriages were ordered immediately after brer'.k fast, and we sallied forth in high spirits \u2014 resolved as I/* said, with his usual felicitous application of Shakspeare, \" To take the tide in the affairs of men.\" The baths ofTitus are on the \u00c6squiline ; and nothing remains of (hem bul piles of brickwork, and a few subterranean chambers almost choked wilh rubbish. Some fragments of exquisite arabesque painting are visible on the ceilings and walls ; and the gilding and colours are still fresh and bright. The brickwork is perfectly solid and firm, and ap peared as if finished yesterday. On the whole the impression on my mind was, that not the slow and gentle hand of lime, but sudden ra pine and violence had caused the devastation around us ; and looking into Nardini on my return, I found lhat the baths of Titus were nearly entire in the thirteenth century, bul were demolished wilh great labour and difficulty by the ferocious Senator Brancaleone, who, about the year 1257, destroyed an infinite number of ancient edifices, \"per logliere ai Nobili il modo di forlisicarsi.\" The ruins were excavated during the pontificate of Julius the Second, and under Ihe direction of Rassaelle, who is supposed to have taken the idea of the arabesques in the Loggie of the Vatican, from the paintings here. We were shown the niche in which the Laocoon stood, when it was discovered in 1502. After leaving the baths, we entered the neighbouring church of San Pielro in Vincoli, lo look again at the beautiful fluted Doric columns which once adorned the splendid edifice of Titus : and on this occa sion we were shown the chest in which the setters of St. Peler are preserved in a triple enclosure of iron, wood, and silver. My un reasonable curiosity not being satisfied by looking at the mere out side of this sacred coffer, 1 turned to the monk who exhibited it, and civilly requested lhat he would open it, and show us Ihe mi raculous treasure it contained. The poor man looked absolutely as tott.ided and aghasi at the audacily of my request, and stammered out, lhat the coffer was never opened, without a written order from his holiness Ihe pope, and in the presence of a cardinal, and, lhat this"], [88, "76 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. savour was never granted lo a heretic (con rispetto parlando ) ; and wilh ibis excuse we were obliged to be satisfied. The church of San Martino del Monte is built on part of the sub structure of the balhs of Titus ; and there is a door opening from the church, by which you descend into Ihe ancient subterranean vaults. The small, but exquisite pillars, and the pavement, which is of the richest marbles, were brought from the Villa of Adrian al Tivoli. The walls were painted in fresco by Nicolo and Gaspar Poussin, and were once a celebrated study for young landscape painters ; almost every vestige ol'colouringis now obliterated by the damp which streams down the walls. There are some excellent modern pictures in good preservation, I think by Carluccio. This church, though not large, is one ofthe most magnificent we have yet seen, and the most precious materials are lavished in profusion on every part. The body of Car dinal Tomasi is preserved here, embalmed in a glass case. It is ex hibited conspicuously, and in my life I never saw (or smelt) any thing so abominable and disgusting. The rest of the morning was spent in the Vatican. I stood to-day for some lime between those two great masterpieces, Ihe Transfiguration of Rassaelle, and Domenicbino's Communionof St. Jerome. I studied them, I examined them figure by figure, and then in the ensemble, and mused upon the different effects they produce, and were designed to produce, until I thought I could decide to my own satisfaction on their respective merits. I am not ignorant that the Transfiguration is pronounced the \" grandest picture in the world,\" nor so insensible to excellence as to regard this glorious composition without all the admiration due to it. I am dazzled by the flood of light which bursts from the opening heavens above, and affected by the dra matic interest of the group below. What splendour of colour ! What variety of expression ! What masterly grouping of the heads 1 I see all this \u2014 but to me Rassaelle's picture wants unity of interest : it is two pictures in one : the demoniac boy in the foreground always shocks me; and thus from my peculiarity of tasle the pleasure it gives me is not so perfect as it ought lo be. On the other hand, I never can lurn lo the Domenichino without being thrilled wilh emotion, and touched with awe. The story is told with the most admirable skill, and with the most exquisite truth and simplicity : the interest is one and the same ; it all centres in the person of the expiring saint ; and the calm benignity of the officiating priest is finely contrasted wilh the countenances of the group who support the dying form of St. Jerome : anxious tenderness, grief, hope, and fear, are expressed wilh such deep pathos and reality, lhat the spectator forgets admiration in sympathy; and I have gazed, till I could almost"], [89, "DIARY OF AN ENMJYl.F,. 77 have fancied myself one of the assistants. The colouring is as admi rable as Ihe composition \u2014 gorgeously rich in effect, but subdued to a tone which harmonizes wilh the solemnity of the subject. There is a curious anecdote connected with this picture, which I wish I had noted down at length as il was related to me, and at the lime 1 heard it : it is briefly this. The picture was painted by Domenichino for the church of San Gioralmo della Carila. At that lime the factions between the different schools of painting ran so high at Rome, that the followers of Domenichino and Guido absolutely slabbed and poisoned each other; and the popular prejudice being in favour of the latter, the Communion of St. Jerome was lorn down from its place, and flung into a lumber garret. Some lime afterwards, Ihe superiors of the convent wishing lo substitute a new altar-piece, commissioned Nicolo Poussin lo execute it; and sent him Domenichino's rejected picture as old canvas lo paint upon. No sooner had the generous Poussin cast his eyes on it, than he was struck, as well he might be, with astonishment and admi ration. He immediately carried it into the church, and there lectured in public on its beauties, until he made Ihe stupid monks ashamed of their blind rejection of such a masterpiece, and boldly gave it that cha racter it has ever since retained, of being the second best picture in the world. 11. \u2014 A parly of four, including L * * and myself, ascended the dome of St. Peter's; and even mounted into the gilt ball. It was a most fa tiguing expedition, and one I have since repented. Igained, however, a more perfect, and a more sublime idea of the architectural wonders of St. Peter's, than I had before; and I was equally pleased and sur prised by the exquisite neatness and cleanliness of every part of the building. We drove from St. Peter's to the church of St. Onofrio, to visit the tomb of Tasso. Ajdain slab marks the spot, which requires nothing but his name to distinguish it. \" After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.\" The poet Guidi lies in a little chapel close by; and his effigy is so placed lhat the eyes appear fixed upon the tomb of Tasso. In the church of Santa Maria Trastevere (which is held in peculiar reverence by the Tresleverini), there is nothing remarkable, except that like many others in Rome, it is rich in the spoils of antique splendour : afterwards lo the palazzo Farneze and the Farnesina, to see the frescos of Haffaelle, Giulio Romano, and theCaraccis, which have long been rendered familiar to me in copies and engravings. 12. \u2014 I did penance at home for the fatigue ofthe day before, and to day (Ihe 13lh) I look a delightful drive of several hours attended only by Saccia. Having examined at different times, and in detail, most of Ihe interesting objects within Ihe compass of the ancient city, I wished lo generalize what I had seen, by a kind of survey of the whole. For"], [90, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 78 this purpose, making the Capitol a central point, I drove first slowly through the Forum, and made the circuit of the Palatine Hill, then by the arch of Janus (which by a late decision of the antiquarians, has no more lo do with Janus than with Jupiter), and the temple of Vesta, back again over the site of the Circus Maximus, between the Palatine and the Aventine (the scene of the Rape of tho Sabines), to the baths of Caracalla, where I spent an hour, musing, sketching, and poetizing; thence to the church of San Stefano Rotundo, once a temple dedicated to Claudius by Agrippina; over Ihe Celian Hill, covered with masses of ruins, to the church of St. John and St. Paul, a small but beautiful edifice; then to the neighbouring church of San Gregorio, from Ihe steps of which there is such a noble view. Thence I returned by the arch of Constantine, and the Coliseum, which frowned on me in black masses through the soft but deepening twilight, through the street now called the Suburra, but formerly the Via Scelerata, where Tullia trampled over the dead body of her father, and so over the Qnirinal home. My excursion was altogether delightful, and gave me the most magni ficent, and I had almoslsaid, Ihe most bewildering ideas of the grandeur and extent of ancient Rome. Every step was classic ground : illustrious names, and splendid recollections crowded upon the fancy \u2014 \" And trailing clouds of glory did they come.\" On the Palatine Hill were the houses of Cicero and the Gracchi; Horace, Virgil, and Ovid resided on the Aventine ; and Mec\u00e6nas and Pliny on the \u00c6squiline. If one little fragment of a wall remained, which could with any shadow of probability be pointed out as belong ing lo the residence of Cicero, Horace, or Virgil, how much dearer, how much more sanctified to memory would it be than all the magni ficent ruins of the fabrics of the C\u00e6sars! But no \u2014 all has passed away. I have heard the remains of Rome coarsely ridiculed, because, after the researches of centuries, so little is comparatively known \u2014 because of the endless disputes of antiquarians, and the night and ignorance in which all is involved ; but to the imagination there is something singu larly striking in this mysterious veil which hangs like a cloud upon the objects around us. I trod to-day over the shapeless masses of building, extending in every direction as far as the eye could reach. Who had inhabited the edifices I trampled under my feet? What hearts had burned \u2014 what heads had thought \u2014 what spirits had kindled there, where nothing was seen but a wilderness and waste, and heaps of ruins, lo which antiquaries \u2014 even Nibby himself \u2014 dare not give a name . All swept away \u2014 buried beneath an ocean of oblivion, above which rise a few great and glorious names, like rocks, over which Ihe billows of time break in vain."], [91, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 79 \" ludi esclamo, quai' notteatra.iinportiina Tutte l'ampie tue glorie a un tratto amorza ! Glorie di senno, di valor, di sorza Gia mille avesti, or non hai pur una!\" One of the most striking scenes I saw to-day was the Roman forum, crowded with the common people gaily dressed (it is a festa or saint's day) ; the women sitting in groups upon the fallen columns, nursing or amusing their children. The men were playing at mora, or at a game like quoits. Under the vast side of the Palatine Hill, on Ihe side of the Circus Maximus, I met a woman mounted on an ass, habited in a most beautiful and singular holiday costume, a man walked by her side, leading the animal she rode, wilh lover-like watchfulness. He was en veste, and I observed that his cloak was thrown over the back of Ihe ass as a substitute for a saddle. Two men followed behind with Iheir long capotes hanging from their shoulders, and carrying guilars, which they struck from time lo time, singing as they walked along. A little in advance there is a small chapel, and Madona. A young girl approached, and laying a bouquet of flowers before the image, she knelt down, hid her face in her apron, and wrung her hands from time to time as if she was praying with fervor. When the group I have just mentioned came up, they left Ihe pathway, and made a circuit of many yards to avoid disturbing her, the men taking off their hats, and the woman inclining her head, in sign of respect, as they passed. All this sounds, while I soberly write it down, very sentimental, and picturesque, and poetical. It was exactly what I saw \u2014 what I often see : such is the place, the scenery, the people. Every group is a picture, the commonest object has some interest attached to it, the commonest action is dignified by sentiment, the language around us is music, and Ihe air we breathe is poetry. Just as I was writing Ihe word music, the sounds of a guitar at tracted me to the window, which looks into a narrow back street, and is exactly opposite a small white house belonging lo a vetturino, who has a very pretty daughter. For her this senerade was evidently in tended; for the moment the music began, she placed a lighl in the window as a signal thatshe listened propitiously, and then retired. The group below consisted of two men, the lover and a musician he had brought with him : the former stood looking up at the window with his hat off, and the musician, after singing two very beautiful airs, concluded wilh the delicious and popular Arietta \" Buona nolle, amato bene!\" to which the lover whistled a second, in such perfect tune, and with such exquisite taste, that I was enchanted. Rome is famous for serenades and serenaders; but at this season they are seldom heard. I remember at Venice being wakened in the dead ofthe night by such"], [92, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 80 delicious music, lhat (lo use a hyperbole common in the mouths of this poetical people) 1 was \" transported to tbe sevenlh heaven :\" be fore I could perfectly recollect myself, the music ceased, the inha bitants of the neighbouring houses threw open their casements, and vehemently and enthusiastically applauded, clapping their hands, and shouting bravos : but neither at Venice, al Padua, nor at Florence did 1 hear any thing that pleased and touched me so much as the serenade to which I have just been listening. \u00bb\u00bb.*** * IA.\u2014 To-day was quite heavenly\u2014 like a lovely May-day in Eng land: the air so pure, so soft, and the sun so warm, that I would gladly have dispensed wilh my shawl and pelisse. We went in car riages to the other side of the Palatine, and then dispersing in small parlies, as will or fancy led, we lounged and wandered about in the Coliseum, and among the neighbouring ruins till dinner time. I climbed up the western side of the Coliseum, at the imminent hazard of my neck; and looking down through a gaping aperture, on the brink of which I had accidentally seated myself, I saw in the colossal corridor far below me, a young artist, who, as if transported out ol bis senses by delight and admiration, was making the most extraor dinary antics and gestures : sometimes he clasped his hands, then ex tended his arms, then slood wilh them folded as in deep Ihought ; now he snatched up his portfolio as if lo draw what so much enchanted him, then Ihrew it down and kicked it from him as if in despair. I never saw such admirable dumb show : it was better than any pantomime. At length, however, he happened to cast up his eyes, as if appealing to heaven, and they encountered mine peeping down upon him from above. He stood fixed and motionless for two seconds, staring at me, and then snatching up his portfolio and his hat, ran off and disappeared. I met the same man afterwards walking along Ihe Via Felice, and could not help smiling as he passed : he smiled too, but pulled his hat over his face and turned away. I discovered to-day (and it is no slight pleasure to make a discovery for one's self), the passage which formed the communicalion between the Coliseum and the Palace ofthe C\u00e6sars, and in which the Emperor Commodus was assassinated. I recognized it by its situation, and the mosaic pavement described by Nihby. If I had time I might mo ralize here, and make an eloquent tirade a la Eustace about imperial monsters and so forth,\u2014 bul in fact I did think while I stood in the damp and gloomy corridor, that it was a silting death for Commodus to die by the giddy playfulness of a child, and the machinations of an abandoned woman. It was not a favourable lime or hour to com lemplale the Coliseum\u2014 the sunshine was too resplendent"], [93, "DIARY OF AN EN M YEE. 81 H was a garish, broad, and peering day, Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears; And every little corner, nook, and hole, Was penetrated by the insolent light. We are told that sive thousand animals were slain in the amphi theatre on its dedication \u2014 how dreadful ! The mutual massacres of the gladiators inspire less horror than this disgusting butchery ! To what a pitch must the depraved appetite for blood and death have risen among the corrupted and ferocious populace, before such a sight could be endured! 15. \u2014 We drove to-day to Ihe tomb of Cecilia Metella, on the Ap pian Way, to the Fountain of Egeria, and the tomb of the Scipios near the Porta Cappena. I wish the tomb of Cecilia Metella had been that of Cornelia or Valeria. There may be little in a name, but how much there is in association 1 What this massy fabric wanted in classical fame Lord Byron has lately supplied in poetical interest. The same may be said of the Fountain of Egeria, to which he has devoted some ofthe most exquisite stanzas in his poem, and has certainly invested it with a charm it could not have possessed before. The woods and groves which once surrounded it, have been all cut down, and the scenery round it is waste and bleak ; but the fountain itself is pretty, over grown with ivy, moss, and the graceful capillaire plant (capello di venere) drooping from the vails, and the stream is as pure as crystal. L**, who was with us, took up a stone to break off a piece ofthe statue, aud maimed, defaced, and'wretched as it is, I could not help think ing it a profanation to the place, and stopped his hand, calling him a barbarous Vandyke: he looked so .wkwardly alarmed and puzzled by the epithet I had given him ! The identity of this spot (like all other places here) has been vehemently disputed. At every step to day we encountered doubt, and contradiction, and cavilling : authorities are marshalled against each other in puzzling array, and the modern unwillingness to be cheated by fine sounds and gieat names has be come a general scepticism. I have no objection to the \"shadows, doubts, and darkness\" which rest upon all around us; it rather pleases my fancy thus to \"dream over the map of things,\" abandoned to my own cogitations and my own conclusions; but then there are certain points upon which it is very disagreeable to have one's faith disturbed ; and the Fountain of Egeria is one of these. So leaving the more learned antiquarians to fight it out, secundum artem, and fire each other's wigs if they will, I am determined, and do steadfastly believe, that the Fountain of Egeria I saw lo-day is the very identical and original Fountain of Egeria\u2014 of Numa's Egeria\u2014 and therefore it jsso. 6"], [94, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 82 The tomb of the Scipios is a dirty dark wine cellar : all Ihe urns, the fine sarcophagus, and the original tablets and inscriptions have been removed to the Vatican. I thought to-day while I stood in the sepul chre, and on the very spot whence the sarcophagus of Publius was re moved, if Scipio, or Augustus, or Adrian, could return to this world, how would their Roman pride endure to see their last resting-places, the towers and the pyramids in which they fortified themselves, thus violated and put to ignoble uses, and the urns which contained their ashes stuck up as ornaments in a painted room, where barbarian vi sitors lounge away their hours, aud stare upon their relics with scornful indifference or idle curiosity ! ***** The people here, even the lowest and meanest among them seem lo have imbibed a profound respect for antiquity and antiquities, which sometimes produces a comic effect. I am often amused by the exul tation with which they point out a bit of old stone, or piece of brick wall, or shapeless fragment of some nameless statue, and tell you it is antico, motto, antico, and the half contemptuous tone in which they praise the most beautiful modern production, e modema \u2014 ma pure -non e cativa ! 18. \u2014 We had an opportunity of witnessing to-day one of the most splendid ceremonies of the Catholic church. It is one of the four fes tivals at which the Pope performs mass in state al the Vatican, the an niversary of St. Peter's entrance into Rome, and of his taking posses sion of the Papal chair ; for here St. Peter is reckoned the first Pope. To see the high priest of an ancient and wide-spread superstition pub licly officiate in his sacred character, in the grandest temple in the universe, and surrounded by all the trappings of his spiritual and tem poral authority, was an exhibition to make sad a reflecting mind, but to please and exalt a lively imagination : I wished myself a Roman Ca tholic for one half hour only. The procession, which was so arranged as to produce the most striking theatrical effect, moved up the central aisle, lo strains of solemn and beautiful music from an orchestra of wind instruments. The musicians were placed out of sight, nor could I guess from what part of the buildings the sounds proceeded ; but the blended harmony, so soft, yet so powerful and so equally diffused, as it floated through the long aisles and lofty domes, had a most heavenly effect. At length appeared the Pope, borne on the shoulders of his attendants, and habited in his full Pontifical robes of white and gold; fans of peacocks' feathers were waved on each side of his throne\u00b0 and boys flung clouds of incense from their censers. As Ihe procession advanced at the slowest possible foot-pace, the Pope from time to time stretched forth his arms which were crossed upon his bosom,and solemnly"], [95, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 83 blessed the people as they prostrated themselves on each side. I could have fancied it the triumphant approach of an Eastern despot, but for the mild and venerable air of the amiable old Pope, who looked as if more humbled than exalted by the pageantry around him. It might be acting, but if so, it was the most admirable acting I ever saw: I wish all his attendants had performed their parts as well. While the Pope assists at mass, it is not etiquette for him lo do any thing for himself: one Cardinal kneeling, holds the book open before him, another carries his handkerchief, a third folds and unfolds his robe, a priest on each side supports him whenever he rises or moves, so that he appears among them like a mere helpless automaton going through a certain set of mechanical motions, with which his will has nothing to do. All who approach or address him prostrate themsejves and kiss his embroidered slipper before they rise. When the whole ceremony was over, and most of the crowd dis persed, the Pope, after disrobing, was passing through a private part of the church where we were standing accidentally, looking at one of ihe monuments. We made the usual obeisance, which he returned by inclining his head. He walked without support, but with great diffi culty, and appeared bent by infirmity and age : his countenance has a melancholy but most benevolent expression, and his dark eyes retain uncommon lustre and penetration. During the twenty-one years he has worn the tiara, he has suffered many vicissitudes and humiliations with dignity and fortitude. He is not considered a man of very pow erful intellect or very shining talents : he is not a Ganganelli or a Lambertini ; but he has been happy in his choice of ministers, and his government has been distinguished by a spirit of liberality, and above all by a partiality to the English, which calls for our respect and gra titude. There were present to-day in St. Peter's about five thousand people, and the church would certainly have contained ten times the number. 19. \u2014 We went to-day to view the restored model of the Coliseum exhibited in the Piazza di Spagna ; and afterwards drove to the manu factory of the beads called Roman Pearl, which is well worth seeing once. The beads are cut from thin lamin\u00e6 of alabaster, and then dipped into a composition made of the scales ofa fish (the Argentina). When a perfect imitation of pearl is intended, they can copy the acci dental defects of colour and form which occur in the real gem, as well as its brilliance, so exquisitely, as to deceive the most practised eye. 20. \u2014 I ordered the open carriage early this morning, and, attended only by Scaccia, partly drove and partly walked through some of the finest parts of ancient Rome. The day has been perfectly lovely ; the u*"], [96, "DIARY\" OF AN ENNUYEE. 84 sky intensely blue without a single cloud ; and though I was weak and far from well, I felt the influence of the soft sunshine in every nerve : the pure elastic air seemed to penetrate my whole frame, and made my spirits bound and my heart beat quicker. It is true, I had to re- gret at every step the want of a more cultivated companion, and that I felt myself shamefully\u2014 no\u2014 not shamefully, but lamentably ignorant of many things. There is so much of which I wish lo know and learn more : so much of my time is spent in hunting books, and acquiring by various means the information with which I ought already to be pre- pared ; so many days are lost by frequent indisposition, that though I enjoy, and feel the value of all I do know and observe, I am tantalized by the thoughts of all I must leave behind me unseen \u2014 there must neces- sarily be so much of what I do not even hear ! Vet, in spite of Ihese drawbacks, my little excursion to-day was delightful. I took a direc- tion just contrary to my last expedition, sirst by the Quattro Fontane to the Santa Maria Maggiore, which I always see with new delight ; then lo Ihe ruins called the temple of Minerva Medici, which stand in a cabbage garden near another sine ruin, once called the Trofei di Mario, and now the Acqua Giulia : thence to the Porta Maggiore, built by Claudius ; and round by the Santa Croce di Gerusalemme. This church was built by Helena, the molher of Constantine, and con tains her tomb, besides a portion of the True Cross from which it de rives its name. The interior of this Basilica struck me as mean and cold. In the fine avenue in front of the Santa Croce, I paused a few minutes lo look round me. To the right were the ruins of Ihe stu pendous Claudian Aqueduct wilh ils gigantic arches, stretching away in one unbroken series far into the Campagna : behind me the am phitheatre of Caslrense : lo the left, other ruins, once called the Tem- ple of Venus and Cupid, and now the Sessorium : in front, the Late- ran, the obelisk of Sesostris, the Porla San Giovanni, and great part of the ancient walls; and thence the view extended lo the foot of the Apennines. All this part of Rome is a scene of magnificent desolation, and of melancholy yet sublime interest : ils wildness, its vastness, its waste and solitary openness, add to its effect upon the imagination. The only human beings I beheld in the compass of at least two miles, were a few herdsmen driving their cattle through the gate of San Gio- vanni, and two or three strangers who were sauntering about with Iheir note books and portfolios, apparently enthusiasls like myself, lost in the memory of the past and the contemplation of the present. I spent some lime intheLateran, then drove to the Coliseum, where I found a long procession of penitents, their figures and faces totally concealed by their masks and peculiar dress, chaunting Ihe Via Crucis. I then examined the site of the Temple of Venus and Rome, and satis- fied myself by ocular demonstration of the truth of the measurements"], [97, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 85 which gave sixty feet for the height of the columns and eighteen feet for the circumference. 1 knew enough of geometrical proportion to prove this to my own satisfaction. On examining the fragments which remain, each fluting measured a foot, that is, eight inches right across. This appears prodigious, but it is nevertheless true. I am forced to believe to-day what I yesterday doubted, and deemed a piece of mere antiquarian exaggeration. This magnificent edifice was designed and built by the Emperor Adrian, who piqued himself on his skill in architecture, and carried his jealousy of other artists so far, as to banish Apollodorus, who had designed the Forum of Trajan. When he had finished the Temple of Venus and Rome, he sent to Apollodorus a plan of his stupendous struc ture, challenging him to find a single fault in it. The architect se verely criticised some trifling oversights ; and the Emperor, conscious of the justice of his criticisms, and unable to remedy the defects, or dered him to be strangled. Such was the fate of Apollodorus, whose misfortune it was to have an Emperor for his rival. They are now clearing the steps which lead to this temple, from which it appears that the length of the portico in front was three hun dred feet, and ofthe side sive hundred feet. While I was among these ruins, I was struck by a little limpid fountain, which gushed from the crumbling wall and lost itself among the fragments of the marble pavement. All looked dreary and deso late ; and that part of the ruin which from its situation must have been the sanctum sanctorum, the shrine of the divinity of the place, is now a receptacle of filth and every conceivable abomination. I walked on to the ruins now called the Basilica of Constantine, once the Temple of Peace. This edifice was in a bad style, and con structed at a period when the arts were at a low ebb : yet the ruins are vast and magnificent. The exact direction of the Via Sacra has long been a subject of vehement dispute. They have now laid open a part of it which ran in front of the Basilica : the pavement is about twelve feet below the present pavement of Rome, and the soil turned up in their excavations is formed entirely of crumbled brickwork and mortar, and fragments of marble, porphyry, and granite. I returned by the Forum and the Capitol, through the Forums of Nerva and Trajan, and so over the Monte Cavallo, home. 23. \u2014 Last night we had a numerous party, and Signor P. and his daughter came to sing. She is a private singer of great talent, and came attended by her lover or her fiance ; who, according lo Italian custom, attends his mistress every where during the few weeks which precede their marriage. He is a young artist, a favourite pupil of Camuccini, and of very quiet, unobtrusive manners. La P. has lh\u00ab"], [98, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 86 misfortune to be plain ; her features are irregular, her complexion of a sickly paleness, and though her eyes are large and dark, they appeared totally devoid of lustre and expression. Herplainness,thebadtasteofher dress, her awkward figure, and her timid and embarrassed deportment, all furnished matter of amusementand observation to some young people, (English of course,) whose propensities for quizzing exceeded their good breeding and good nature. Though La P. does not understand a word of either French or English, I thought she could not mistake the sig nificant looks and whispers of which she was the object, and I was in pain for her, and for her modest lover. I drew my chair to the pi ano, and tried to divert her attention by keeping her in conversation, but I could get no farther than a few questions which were answered in monosyllables. At length she sang\u2014 and sang divinely : I found the pale automaton had a soul as well as a voice. After giving us, wilh faultless execution, as well as great expression, some of Rossini's finest songs, she sung the beautiful and difficult cavatina in Otello, \" Assisa al pie d'un Salice,\" with the most enchanting style and pathos, and then stood as unmoved as a statue while the company applauded loud and long. A moment afterwards, as she stooped to take up a music book, her lover, who had edged himself by degrees from the door to the piano, bent his head too, and murmured in a low voice, but with the most passionate accent, \" 0 brava, brava cara !\" She replied only by a look \u2014 but it was such a look ! I never saw a human coun tenance so entirely, so instantaneously changed in character : the vacant eyes kindled arfd beamed with tenderness : the pale cheek glowed, and a bright smile playing round her mouth, just parted her lips sufficiently to discover a set of teeth like pearls. I could have called her at that moment beautiful ; but the change was as transient as sudden \u2014 it passed like a gleam of light over her face and vanished, and by the time the book was placed on the desk, she looked as plain, as stupid, and as statue-like as ever. I was the only person who had witnessed this little by-scene ; and it gave me pleasant thoughts and interest for the rest of the evening. Another trait of character occurred afterwards, which amused me, but in a very different style. Our new Danish friend, the Baron B , told us he had once been present at the decapitation of nine men, having sirst fortified himself with a large goblet of brandy. After describing the scene in all its horrible details, and assuring us in his bad German French lhat it was \" une chose bien mauvaise a voir,\" I could not help asking him wilh a shudder, how he felt after wards ; whether it was not weeks or months before the impressions of horror left his mind? He answered with smiling naivete and taking a pinch of snuff, \" Ma foil madame, je n'ai pas pu manger de la viande toute eette journe'e-ld?\""], [99, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 87 27. \u2014 We drove to the Palazzo Spada, to see the famous Spada Pompey, said to be the very statue at the base of which C\u00e6sar fell. I was pleased to find, contrary to my expectations, that this statue has great intrinsic merit, besides its celebrity, to recommend it. The extremities of the limbs have a certain clumsiness which may perhaps be a feature of resemblance, and not a fault of the sculptor ; but the attitude is noble, and Ihe likeness of the head to the undisputed bust of Pompey in the Florentine gallery, struck me immediately. The Palazza Spada, wilh ils splendid architecture, dirt, discomfort, and dilapidation, isa fair specimen of the Roman palaces in general. It contains a corridor, which from an architectural deception appears much longer than it really is. I hate tricks \u2014 in architecture espe cially. We afterwards visited the Pantheon, the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, (an odd combination of names,) and concluded the morning at Canova's. It is one of the pleasures of Rome to lounge in the studj of the best sculptors ; and it is at Rome only that sculpture seems to flourish as in its native soil. Rome is truly the city ofthe soul, the home of art and artists. With the divine models of the Vatican ever before their eyes, these inspiring skies above their heads, and the quarries of marble at a convenient distance \u2014 it is here only they can conceive and execute those works which are formed from the beau-ideal; but it is not here they meet with patronage: the most beautiful things I have seen at the various studj have all been executed for English, German, and Russian noblemen. The names I heard most frequently were those of the Dukes of Bedford and De vonshire, Prince Esterhazy, and the King of England, Canova has been accused of a want of simplicity, and of giving a too voluptuous expression to some of his figures : with all my admi ration of his genius, I confess the censure just. It is particularly ob servable in the Clori svegliata (the Nymph awakened by Love), the Cupid and Psyche, for Prince Yousouppoff, the Endymion, the Graces, and some others. In some of Thorwaldson's works there is exquisite grace, simpli city, and expression : the Shepherd Boy, the Adonis, the Jason, and the Hebe, have a great deal of antique spirit. I did not like the colossal Christ which Ihe sculptor has just finished in clay: it is a proof that bulk alone does not constitute sublimity : it is deficient in dignity, or rather in divinity. At Rodolf Schadow's, I was most pleased by the Cupid and the Filatrice. His Cupid is certainly the most beautiful Cupid I ever saw, superior, I think, both to Canova's and to Thorwaldson's. The Filatrice, though so exquisitely natural and graceful, a little disap pointed me ; I had heard much of it, and had formed in my own"], [100, "IM W!. OF AN ENNLYEE. 88 imagination an idea different and superior to what I saw. This beau tiful figure has repose, simplicity, nature, and grace, but I felt a ivant \u2014 the want of some internal sentiment : for instance, if, instead of watching the rotation of her spindle with such industrious attention, the Filatrice had looked careless, or absent, or pensive, or discon solate, (like Faust's Margaret at her spinning-wheel,) she would have been more interesting\u2014 but not perhaps what the sculptor intended to represent. Schadow is ill, bul we were admitted by his order into his private study ; we saw there the Bacchante, which he has just finished in clay, and which is to emulate or rival Canova's Dansatrice. He has been at work upon a small but beautiful figure ofa piping Shepherd-boy, which is just made out : beside it lay Virgil's Eclogues, and his spectacles were between the leaves. * Almost every thing I saw at Max Laboureur's struck me as vapid and finikin. There were some pretty groups, but nothing to tempt me to visit it again. a. * * * * * * 30. \u2014 We spent the whole morning at the Villa Albani, where there is a superb collection of antique marbles, most of them brought from the Villa of Adrian at Tivoli. To note down even a few of the objects which pleased me would be an endless task. I think the busts in terested me most. There isa basso-relievo of Antinous \u2014 the beauti ful head declined in his usual pensive attitude : il is the most finished and faultless piece of sculpture in relievo I ever saw ; and as perfect and as polished as if it came from the chisel yesterday. There is another basso-relievo of Marcus Aurelius, and Faustina, equal to the last in execution, but not in interest. We found Rogers in the gardens : the old poet was sunning himself \u2014 walking up and down a beautiful marble portico, lined with works of art, with his note-book in his hand. I am told he is now writing a poem of which Italy is the subject ; and here, with all the Campagna di Roma spread out before him \u2014 above him, the sunshine and the cloudless skies \u2014 and all around him, the remains of antiquity in a thousand elegant, or venerable, or fanciful forms: he could not have chosen a more genial spot for inspiration. Though we disturbed his poetical reveries rather abruptly, he met us with his usual amiable courtesy, and conversed most delightfully. I never knew him more pleasant, and never saw him so animated. Our departure from Rome has been postponed from day lo day in * Poor Schadow died yesterday.

An Austrian colonel was taken by the banditti near Fondi, and carried up into the mountains: ten thousand scudi were demanded for his ransom ; and for many days past, the whole city has been in a slate of agilation and suspense about his ultimate fate. The Austrians, roused by the insult, sent a large body of troops (some say three thousand men) against about one hun dred and fifty robbers, threatening to exterminate them. They were pursued so closely, that after dragging their unfortunate captive over the mountains from one fastness to another, till he was nearly dead from exhauslion and ill-treatment, they either abandoned or surren dered him without terms. The troops immediately marched back lo Naples, and the matter rests here : I cannot learn that any thing farther will be done. The robbers being at present panic-struck by such un usual energy and aclivity, and driven from Iheir accustomed haunts, by these valorous champions of good order and good policy, it is consi dered that the road is now more open and safe than it has been for some time, and if nolhing new happens to alarm us, we set off on Friday next. I visited to-day the baths of Dioclesian.and the noble church which Michel Angelo has constructed upon, and out of, their gigantic ruins. It has all lhat grand simplicity, that entireness which characterizes his works : it contains, too, some admirable pictures. On leaving the church, I saw on each side of the door, the monuments of Sal vator Rosa and Carlo Maratti \u2014 what a contrast do they exhibit in their genius, in their works, in their characters, in their countenances, in their lives ! Near this church (the Santa Maria dei Angeli) is the superb fountain of the Acqua Felice, the sirst view of which rather disappointed me. I had been told that it represented Moses striking the rock, \u2014 a magni- ficent idea for a fountain ! but the execution falls short of the concep- tion. The waler, instead of gushing from the rock, is poured out from the mouths of two prodigious lions of basalt, brought, I believe, from Upper Egypt : they seem misplaced here. A liltle beyond the Ponta Pia is the Campo Sceleralo, where the Vestals were interred alive. We afterwards drove to the Sanli Aposloli to see the tomb of the excellent Ganganelli, by Canova. Then to Sans Ignazio, to see the famous ceiling painted in perspective by the Jesuit Pozzo. The effect is certainly marvellous, making the interior appear to the eye, at least twice the height it really is; but though the illusion pleased me as a work of art, I thought the trickery unnecessary and misplaced. At the magnificent church of the Gesuiti (where there are two entire co- lumns of giallo antico) I saw a list of relics for which the church is celebrated, and whose efficacy and sanctity were vouched for by a very respectable catalogue of miracles. Among these relics there are a few"], [102, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 90 worth mentioning for their oddity, viz. one of Ihe Virgin's shifts, three of her hairs, and the skirt of Joseph's coat. 31.\u2014 We spent nearly the whole day in the gallery of the Vatican, and in the Pauline and Sistine chapels. February 1st, at Falletri.\u2014I left Rome this morning exceedingly depressed : Madame de Stael may well call travelling un triste plaisir. My depression did not arise from the feeling that I left behind me any thing or any person to regret, but from mixed and melancholy emo tions, and partly perhaps from that weakness which makes my hand tremble while I write\u2014 which has bound down my mind, and all its best powers, and all its faculties of enjoyment, to a languid passive ness, making me feel at every moment, I am not what I was, or ought to be, or might have been. We arrived, after a short and most delightful journey by Albano, the Lake Nemi, Gensao, etc. at Velletri, the birth-place of that wretch Octavius, and famous for ils wine. The day has been as soft and as sunny as a May-day in England, and the country, through which we travelled but loo rapidly, beyond description lovely. The blue Medi terranean spread far to the west, and on the right we had the snowy mountains, with their wild fantastic peaks \"rushing on the sky.\" I felt it all in my heart with a mixture of sadness and delight which I cannot express. This land was made by nature a paradise : it seems to want no charm, \" unborrowed from the eye,\" \u2014 but how has memory sancti fied, history illustrated, and poetry illumined the scenes around us; where every rivulet had ils attendant nymph, where every wood was protected by its sylvan divinity ; where every tower has its tale of heroism, and \" not a mountain lifts its head unsung;\" and though the faith, Ihe glory, and the power of the antique time be passed away \u2014 still A spirit hangs, Beautiful region! o'er thy towns and farms Statues and temples, and memorial tombs. I can allow that one-half, at least, of Ihe beauty and interest we see, lies in our own souls ; that it is our own enthusiasm which sheds this mantle of light over all we behold : but, as colours do not exist in the objects themselves, but in the rays which paint them \u2014 so beauty is not less real, is not less beauty, because it exists in the medium through which we view certain objects, rather than in those objects themselves. I have met persons who think they display a vast deal of common sense, and very uncommon strength of mind, in rising superior to all prejudices of education and illusions of romance \u2014 to whom enthusiam is only another name for affectation \u2014 who, where the cultivated and"], [103, "DIARY OF AN ENNUY&E. 91 the contemplative mind finds ample matter to excite feeling ahd re flection, give themselves airs of fashionable nonchalance, or flippant scorn \u2014 to whom Ihe crumbling ruin is so much brick and morlar, no more \u2014 to whom the tomb ofthe Horatii and Curiatii is a stack of chimneys, tho Pantheon an old oven, and the Fountain of Egeria a pig-sty. Are such persons aware that in all this there is an affectation, a thousand times more gross and contemptible, than that affectation (too frequent perhapsj which they design to ridicule ? \" Whose mind is but the mind of his own eyes, He is a slave \u2014 the meanest we can meet.\" 2. \u2014 Our journey to-day has been long, but delightfully diversified, and abounding in classical beauty and interest. I scarce know what lo say, now that I open my little book to record my own sensations : they are so many, so various, so painful, so delicious \u2014 my senses and my imagination have been so enchanted, my heart so very heavy \u2014 where shall I begin ? In some of the scenes of to-day \u2014 at Terracina, particularly, there was beauly beyond what I ever beheld or imagined : the scenery of Switzerland is of a different character, and on a different scale : it is beyond comparison grander, more gigantic, more overpowering, but it is not so poetical. Switzerland is not Italy \u2014 is not the enchanting south. This soft balmy air, these myrtles, orange-groves, palm-trees ; these cloudless skies, this bright blue sea, and sunny hills, all breathe of an enchanted land : \" a land of Faery.\" Between Velletri and Terracina the road runs in one undeviating line through the Pontine Marshes. The accounts we have of the baneful effects of the malaria here, and the absolute solitude, (not a human face or a human habitation intervening from one post-house to another,) invest the wild landscape with a frightful and peculiar character of desolation. As for the mere exterior of the country, I have seen more wretched and sterile looking spots, (in France, for instance,) but none that so affected the imagination and the spirits. On leaving the Pon tine Marshes, we came almost suddenly upon Ihe sunny and luxuriant region near Terracina : here was the ancient city of Anxur; and the gothic ruins of the castle of Theodoric, which frown on the steep above, are contrasted with the delicate and Grecian proportions of Ihe temple below. All the country round is famed in classic and poetic lore. The Promontory (once poetically the island) of Circe is still the Monte Circello : here was the region of the Lestrygons, and the scene of part of the \u00c6neid and Odyssey ; and Corinne has superadded romantic and charming associations quite as delightful, and quite as true. Antiquarians, who, like politicians, \"seem lo see the things that are"], [104, "DIARY OF AN ENNUY_-E. 92 not,\" have placed all along this road, the sites of many a celebrated town and fane \u2014 ' ' making hue and cry after many a city which has run away, and by certain marks and tokens pursuing to sind it:\" as some old author says so quaintly. At every hundred yards, fragments of masonry are seen by the road-side; portions of brickwork, somelimes traced at the bottom of a dry ditch, or incorporated into a fence; some- times peeping above Ihe myrtle bushes on the wild hills, where the green lizards lie basking and glittering on them in thousands, and Ihe stupid ferocious buffalo, wilh his fierce red eyes, rubs his hide and glares upon us as we pass. No \u2014 not Ihe grandest monuments of Rome \u2014 not the Coliseum itself, in all ils decaying magnificence, ever inspired me wilh such profound emotions as did those nameless, shapeless vestiges ofthe dwellings of man, starting up like memorial tombs in the midst of this savage but luxuriant wilderness. Of the beauliful cities which rose along this lovely coast, the colonies of elegant and polished Greece \u2014 one after another swallowed up by the \" insatiate maw\" of ancient Rome, nothing remains \u2014 their sites, their very names have passed away and perished. We might as well hunt after a forgotten dream. Vain was the chief's, the sage's pride, Tbey bad no poet, and they died ! In vain they toil'd, in vain they bled, They bad no poet \u2014 and are dead. I write this a Gaeta \u2014 a name famous in the poetical, the classical; the military story of Italy, from the day of \u00c6neas, from whom it re ceived its appellation, down to the annals of the late war. On the site of our inn, (Ihe Albergo di Cicerone,) stood Cicero's Formian Villa; and in an adjoining grove he was murdered in his litter by the satellites of the Triumviri, as he attempted to escape. 1 stood to-night on a little terrace, which hung over an orange grove, and enjoyed a scene which I would paint, if words were forms, and hues, and sounds \u2014 not else. A beautiful bay, enclosed by the Mola di Gaeta, on one side, and the Pro montory of Misenum on the other: the sky studded wilh stars and re flected in a sea as blue as itself \u2014 and so glassy and unruffled, it seemed to slumber in the moonlight: now and then the murmur of a wave, not hoarsely breaking on rock and shingles, but kissing the turfy shore, where oranges and myrtles grew down to the waler edge. These, and the remembrances connected with all, and a mind to think, and a heart to feel, and thoughls both of pain and pleasure mingling to render the effect more deep and touching. \u2014 Why should I write this? 0 surely I need not fear that I sha\\\\ forget !"], [105, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 93 LINES WRITTEN AT MOLA DI GAETA, NEAR THE RUINS OF CICERO'S FORMIAN VILLA. We wandered through bright climes, and drank the beams Ofsouthern suns : Elysian scenes we view'd, Such as we picture oft in those day dreams That haunt the fancy in her wildest mood. Upon the sea-beat vestiges we stood, Where Cicero dwelt, and watch'd the latest gleams Of rosy light steal o'er the azure flood : And memory conjur'd up most glowing themes, Filling the expanded heart, till it forgot Its own peculiar grief! \u2014 0 ! ifthe dead Yret haunt our earth, around this hallow'd spot, Hovers sweet Tully's spirit, since it fled The Roman Forum \u2014 Forum now no more !

That shed a glory round her pensive brow, And make her still the worship of the earth ! Naples. Sunday 3rd. \u2014 We left Gaeta early. If the scene was so beautiful in the evening \u2014 how bright, how lovely it was this morn ing! The sun had not long risen; and a soft purple mist hung over part of the sea ; while to the north and west the land and waler sparkled and glowed in the living light. Some little fishing boats which had just put off, rocked upon the glassy sea, which lent them a gentle motion, though itself appeared all mirror-like and motionless. The orange and lemon trees in full foliage literally bent over the water ; and it was so warm at half past eight that I felt their shade a relief. After leaving Gaeta, the first place of note is or was Minturnum, where Marius was taken, concealed in Ihe marshes near it. The marshes remain, the city has disappeared. Capua is still a large town; but it certainly does not keep up its ancient fame for luxury and good cheer: for we found it extremely difficult to procure any thing to eat. The next town is Avversa, a name unknown, I believe, in the classical history of Italy : it was founded, if I remember rightly, by the Norman knights. Near this place is or was the convent where Queen Joanna strangled her husband Andrea, wilh a silken cord of her own weaving. So says the story : non lo credo io. From Avversa lo Naples the country is not interesting; but fertile and rich beyond description : an endless succession of vineyards and orange groves. At length we reached Naples; all tired and in a par-"], [106, "DIARY OF AN l_NNUYEE. 94 ticularly sober and serious mood : we remembered it was the Sabbath, and had forgotten that it was the first day ofthe Carnival; and great was our amazement at the scene which met us on our arrival \u2014 I looked, I stared, I smiled, I laughed : and all The weight of sadness was in wonder lost. The whole city seemed one vast puppet-show ; and the noisy gaiety of the crowded streets almost stunned me. One of the sirst objecls we encountered was a barouche full of Turks and Sultanas, driven by an old woman in a tawdry court dress as coachman; while a merry andrew and a harlequin capered behind as footmen. Owing to Ihe im mense size of the city, and the difficulty of making our way through the motley throng of masks, beggars, lazzaroni, eating-stalls, carts and carriages, we were nearly three hours traversing the streets before we reached our inn on the Chiaja. I feel tired and over-excited : I have been standing on my balcony looking out upon the moonlit bay, and listening to the mingled shouts, the laughter, the music all around me ; and thinking \u2014 till I feel in no mood to write. 7. \u2014 Last night we visited the theatre of San Carlo. It did not strike me as equal to the Scala at Milan. The form is not so fine, the extent of the stage is, or appeared to be, less ; but there is infinitely more gilding and ornament; the mirrors and lights, the sky-blue draperies produce a splendid effect, and the coup-d'\u0153il is, on the whole, more gay, more theatre-like. It was crowded in every part, and many of the audience were in dominos and fancy dresses: a few were masked. Rossini's Barbiere di Seviglia, which contains, I think more melody than all his other operas put together, (the Tancredi perhaps excepted,) was mostenchantingly sung, and as admirably acted ; and the beautiful classical ballet of \"Niobe and her Children,\" would have appeared nothing short of perfection, had I not seen the Didone Abbandonataat Milan. But they have no actress here like the graceful, the expressive Pallerini; nor any actor equal to the \u00c6neas of the Scala. The Austrians, who are paramount here, allow masks only twice a week, Sundays and Thursdays. The people seem determined to in demnify themselves for this restriction on their pleasures by every allowed excess during the two days of merriment, which their despotic conquerors have spared them. I am told by M**and S**, our Italian friends, that the Carnival is now fallen off from its wild spirit of fanciful gaiety; that it is stupid, dull, tasteless, in comparison to what it was formerly, owing to the severity of the Austrian police. I know nothing about the propriety of the measures which have been resorted"], [107, "DIARY OF AN ENNU.&G. 95 lo for curbing the excesses of the Carnival : I think if people will run away instead of sighting for their national rights, they must be content to suffer accordingly \u2014 but I meddle not with politics, and with all my heart abhor them. Whatever the gailies of the Carnival may have been formerly, it is scarce possible lo conceive a more fantastic, a more picturesque, a more laughable scene than the Strada di Toledo ex hibited to-day ; the whole city seemed to wear \"one universal grin ;\" and such an incessant sire of sugar-plums (or whal seemed such) was carried on, and with such eagerness and mimic fury, that when our car riage came out of the conflict, we all looked as if a sack of flour had been shaken over us. The implements used in this ridiculous warfare, are, for common purposes, little balls of plaster of Paris and flour, made lo resemble small comfits : friends and acquaintances pelted each other with real confetti, and those of Ihe most delicious and expensive kinds. A double file of carriages moved in a contrary direction along the Corso ; a space in the middle and on each side being left for horsemen and pedestrians, and the mostexact order was maintained by the guards and police; so lhat if by chance a carriage lost its place in the line it was impossible to recover it, and it was immediately obliged to leave Ihe street, and re-enter by one ofthe extremities. Besides the warfare carried on below, the balconies on each side were crowded wilh people in gay or grotesque dresses, who had sacks of bon-bons before them, from which they showered vollies upon those beneath, or aimed across the street at each other : some of them filled their handkerchiefs, and then dexterously loosening the corners, and taking a certain aim, flung a volley at once. This was like a cannon loaded with grape-shot, and never sailed to do the most terrific execution. Among the splendid and fanciful equipages of the masqueraders, was one, containing the Duke of Monteleone's family, in the form of a ship, richly ornamented, and drawn by six horses mounted by masks for postilions. The fore part of the vessel contained the Duke's party, dressed in various gay costumes, as Tartar warriors and Indian queens. In the stern were the servants and attendants, travestied in the most grotesque and ludicrous style. This magnificent and unwieldly car had by some chance lost its place in the procession, and vainly en deavoured to whip in ; as it is a point of honour among the charioteers not to yield Ihe pas. Our coachman, however, was ordered (theugh most unwilling) to draw up and make way for it ; and this little civility was acknowledged, not only by a profusion of bows, but by such a shower of delicious sugar plums, that the seats of our carriage were literally covered with them, and some ofthe gentlemen flung into our laps elegant lillle baskets, fastened with ribbons, and filled with ex quisite sweetmeats. I could not enter into all this with much spirit ; \" non son io quel ch'un tempo sui:\" but I was an amused, though a"], [108, "DIARt UJ. AN E.sNUYEF.. 96 quiet spectator ; and sometimes saw much more lhan those who were actually engaged in the battle. I observed that lo-day our carriage became an object of attention, and a favourite point of attack to several parties on foot, and in carriages ; and I was at no loss to discover the reason. I had with me a lovely girl, whose truly English style of beauty, her brilliant bloom, heightened by her eager animation, her lips dimpled wilh a thousand smiles, and her whole countenance radiant with glee and mischievous archness, made her an object of admiration, which the English expressed by a fixed stare, and the Italians by sympathetic smiles, nods, and all the usual superlatives of delight. Among our most potent and malignant adversaries, was a troop of elegant masks in a long open carriage, the form of which was totally concealed by the boughs of laurel, and wreaths of artificial flowers, with which it was covered. It was drawn by six sine horses, fancifully caparisoned, ornamented wilh plumes of feathers, and led by grotesque masks. In the carriage stood twelve persons in black silk dominos, black hats, and black masks; with plumes of crimson feathers, and rich crimson sashes. They were armed with small painted targets and tin tubes, from which they shot vollies of confetti, in such quan tities, and with such dexterous aim, lhat we were almost overwhelmed whenever we passed them. It was in vain we returned the compli ment ; our small shot rattled on their masks, or bounded from their shields, producing only shouts of laughter at our expense. A favourite style of mask here, is the dress of an English sailor, straw hats, blue jackets, white trowsers, and very while masks wilh pink cheeks : we saw hundreds in this whimsical costume. 13. \u2014 On driving home rather late this evening, and leaving the noise, Ihe crowds, the confusion and festive folly of the Strada di Toledo, we came suddenly upon a scene, which, from its beauty, no less lhan by the force of contrast, strongly impressed my imaginalion. The shore was silent, and almost solitary : the bay as smooth as a mirror, and as still as a frozen lake; the sky, the sea, the mountains round were all of Ihe same hue, a soft grey (inged with violet, except where the sunset had left a narrow crimson streak along the edge of the sea. There was not a breeze, not the slightest breath of air, and a single vessel, a frigate with all its white sails crowded, lay motionless as a monument on the bosom of the waters, in which it was reflected as in a mirror. I have seen the bay more splendidly beautiful; but I never saw so peculiar, so lovely a picture, lt lasted but a short time : the transparent purple veil became a dusky pall, and night and shadow gradually enveloped the whole. * \" A chasm occurs here of about twenty pages, which in the original MS. are torn out.

Nature here seems to celebrate a continual Festa, and to be for ever decked out in holiday costume ! A drive along the \" sempre beata Mergellina\" to the extremity of the Promontory of Pausilippo is positive enchantment : thence we looked over a landscape of such splendid and unequalled interest! the shores of Baia, where Cicero, Horace, Virgil, Pliny, Mec\u00e6nas, lived ; the white towers of Puzzuoli and the Islands of Ischia, Procida, and Nisida. There wastheSybil'sCave, LakeAcheron, and the fabled Lethe ; there the sepulchre of Misenus, who defied the Triton ; and the scene of Ihe whole sixth book of the \u00c6neid, which I am now reading in Annibal Caro's translation : there Agrippina mourned Ger manicus ; and there her daughter fell a victim to her monster of a son. At our feet lay the lovely little Island of Nisida, the spot on which Brutus and Porlia parted for the last time before the battle of Philippi. To the south of the bay Ihe scenery is not less magnificent, and scarcely less dear to memory : Naples, rising from the sea like an amphitheatre of white palaces, and towers, and glittering domes : beyond, Mount Vesuvius, with the smoke curling from its summits like a silver cloud, and forming the only speck upon the intense blue sky ; along its base Portici, Annunziata, Torre del Greco, glitter in the sun; every white building \u2014 almost every window in every building, distinct to the eye at the distance of several miles : farther on, and perched like while nests on the mountainous promontory, lie Castel a Mare, and Sorrento, the birthplace of Tasso, and his asylum when the injuries of his cold hearted persecutors had stung him lo madness, and drove him here for refuge to the armsofhis sister. Yet, farther on, Capua rises from the sea, a beautiful object in itself, but from which the fancy gladly turns to dwell again upon the snowy buildings of Sorrento. \" O de la liberty vieille et sainte patrie !

Mount Vesuvius is at this moment blazing like a huge furnace; throwing up every minute, or half minute columns of sire and red-hot stones, which fall in showers and bound down the side of the mountain. On the east, there are two distinct streams of lava descending, which glow with almost a white heat, and every burst of flame is accompanied by a sound resembling cannon at a distance. \u2014 I can hardly write, my mind is so overflowing with astonishment, admiration, and sublime pleasure : what a scene as I looked out on the bay from the Sante Lucia 1 On one side, Ihe evening star and the thread-like crescent of the new moon were setting together over Pau silippo, reflected in lines of silver radiance on Ihe blue sea ; on the other the broad train of fierce red light glared upon the water with a fitful splendour, as the explosions were more or less violent : before me all was so soft, so lovely, so tranquil! while I had only to turn my head to be awe-struck by the convulsion of fighting elements. I remember, that on our first arrival at Naples, I was disappointed because Vesuvius did not smoke so much as I had been led to expect from pictures and descriptions. The smoke then lay like a scarcely perceptible cloud on the highest point, or rose in a slender white co lumn ; to-day and yesterday, it has rolled from the crater in black volumes, mixing with the clouds above, and darkening the sky. Half-past twelve . \u2014 I have walked out again : the blaze from the crater is less vivid ; but there are now four streams of lava issuing from it, which have united in two broad currents, one of which extends be low the hermitage. It is probable lhat by lo-morrow night it will have reached the lower part of the mountain. Sunday, U. \u2014 Just returned from chapel at the English ambassador's, where the service was read by a dandy clergyman lo a crowd of fine and superfine ladies and gentlemen, crushed together into a hot room. I never saw extravagance in dress carried to such a pitch as it is by my countrywomen here, \u2014 whether Ihey dress at the men or against each other, it is equally bad taste. The sermon to-day was very appro priate, from the text, \" Take ye no thought what ye shall eat, orwhat yeshalldrink, or what ye shall put on,\" and, I daresay, it was list ened lo with singular edification. 5 o'clock. \u2014 We have been driving along the Strada Nuova in L**'s britschka, whence we had a sine view of Vesuvius. There are tremen dous bursts of smoke from the crater. At one time the whole moun tain, down to the very base, was almost enveloped, and the atmosphere round it loaded with the vapour, which seemed to issue in volumes 7\""], [112, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYI.E. 100 half as large as the mountain itself. If horses are to be had we go up to-night. Monday night.\u2014 I am not in a humour to describe, or give way to any poetical flights, but I must endeavour lo give a faithful, sober, and circumstantial account of our last night's expedition, while the impres- sion is yet fresh on my mind ; though there is, I think, little danger of my forgetting. We procured horses, which, from the number of persons proceeding on the same errand with ourselves, was a matter of some difficulty. We sel out at seven in the evening in an open car- riage, and almost the whole way we had the mountain before us, spouting fire to a prodigious height. The road was crowded with groups of people who had come out from the city and environs to take a nearer view ofthe magnificent spectacle, and numbers were hurrying to and fro in those little flying corricoli which are peculiar to Naples. As we approached, the explosions became more and more vivid, and at every tremendous burst of fire our friend L** jumped half off his seat, making most loud and characteristic exclamations, \u2014 \" By Jove ! a magnificent fellow ! now for it, whizz! there he goes, sky high, by George !\" The rest of the party were equally enthusiastic in a different style ; and I sat silent and quiet from absolute inability to express what I felt. I was almost breathless with wonder, and excitement, and impatience to be nearer the scene of action. While my eyes were fixed on Ihe mountain, my attention was, from time to time, excited by regular rows of small shining lights, six or eight in number, creep- ing, as it seemed, along the edge of the stream of lava; and, when contrasted with the red blaze which rose behind, and the gigantic black back-ground, looking like a procession of glowworms. These were the torches of travellers ascending the mountain, and I longed to be one of them. We reached Resina a little before nine, and alighted from the car riage ; the ascent being so rugged and dangerous, that only asses and mules accustomed lo the road are used. Two only were in waiting at the moment we arrived, which L** immediately secured for me and himself ; and though reluctant to proceed without the rest of the party, we were compelled to go on before, that we might not lose time, or hazard the loss of our monture. We set off then, each with two at tendants, a man to lead our animals and a torch-bearer. The road, as we ascended, became more and more steep at every step, being over a stream of lava, intermixed with stones and ashes, and the darkness added to the difficulty. But how shall I describe the scene and the p-ople who surrounded us ; the landscape partially lighted by a fearful red glare, the precipitous and winding road bordered by wild looking gigantic aloes, projecting their huge spear-like leaves almost across our path, and our lazzaroni attendants with their shrill shouts, and strange"], [113, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 101 dresses, and wild jargon, and striking features, and dark eyes flashing in the gleam of the torches, which they flung round their heads to pre vent their being extinguished, formed a scene so new, so extraordinary, so like romance, that my attention was frequently drawn from the mountain, though blazing in all its tumultuous magnificence. The explosions succeeded each other wilh terrific rapidity about two in every three minutes ; and the noise I can only compare to the roaring and hissing of fen thousand imprisoned winds, mingled at times with a rumbling sound like artillery, or distant thunder. It frequently happened that the guides, in dashing their torches against the ground, set fire to the dried thorns and withered grass, and the blaze ran along the earth like wildfire, to the great alarm of poor L**, who saw in every burning bush a stream of lava rushing to overwhelm us. Before eleven o'clock we reached the Hermitage, situated between Vesuvius and the Somma, and the highest habitation on the mountain. A great number of men were assembled within, and guides, lazzaroni, servants, and soldiers, were lounging round. I alighted, for I was be numbed and tired, but did not like to venture among those people, and it was proposed that we should wait for the rest of our party a little further on. We accordingly left our donkeys and walked forward upon a kind of high ridge which serves to fortify the Hermitage and its en virons against the lava. From this path, as we slowly ascended, we had a glorious view of the eruption ; and the whole scene around us, in its romantic interest and terrible magnificence, mocked all power of description. There were, at this time, five distinct torrents of lava rolling down like streams of molten lead ; one of which extended above two miles below us and was flowing towards Portici. The showers of red-hot stones flew up like thousands of sky rockets : many of them being shot up perpendicularly fell back into the crater, others falling on the outside bounded down the side of the mountain with a velocity which would have distanced a horse at full speed : these stones were of every size, from Iwo to ten or twelve feet in diameter. My ears were by this lime wearied and stunned by the unceasing roaring and hissing of the flames, while my eyes were dazzled by the glare of the red, fierce light : now and then I turned them for relief to other features of the picture, to the black shadowy masses of the landscape stretched beneath us, and speckled with shining lights, which showed how many were up and watching that night ; and often to the calm vaulted sky above our heads, where thousands of stars (not twinkling as through our hazy or frosty atmosphere, but shining out of \" heaven's profoundest azure,\" with that soft steady brilliance pe culiar to a highly rarified medium) looked down upon this frightful turmoil in all their bright and placid loveliness. Nor should I forget one other feature of a scene, on which I looked with a painter's eye."], [114, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 102 Great numbers of the Austrian forces, now occupying Naples, were oh the mountains, assembled in groups, some standing, some sitting, some stretched on the ground and wrapped in their cloaks, in various at titudes of amazement and admiration : and as the shadowy glare fell on their tall martial figures and glittering accoutrements, I thought I had never beheld any thing so wildly picturesque. The remainder of our party not yet appearing, we sent back for our asses and guides, and determined to proceed. About half a mile beyond, our companions came up, and here a division took place ; some agreeing to go forward, the rest turning back to wait at the Hermitage. I was of course one of those who advanced. My spirits were again raised, and the grand object of all this daring and anxiety was to ap proach near enough to a stream of lava to have some idea of ils con sistency, and the manner in which it flowed, or trickled down. The difficulties of our road now increased, \"\u25a0 if road that might be called, which road was none,\" but black loose ashes, and masses of scoria and lava heaped in ridges, or broken into hollows in a manner not to be described. Even my animal, though used to the path, felt his footing at every step, and if the lorch was by accident extinguished, he stopped, and nothing could make him move. My guide, Andrea, was very vigilant and attentive, and, in the few words of Italian he knew, en^ couraged me, and assured me there was no danger. I had, however, no fear : in fact, I was infinitely too much interested to have been alive to danger, had it really existed. Salvador, well known to all who have visited Mount Vesuvius, had been engaged by Mr. R. as his guide. He is the principal cicerone on the mountain. It is his bu siness to despatch to the king every three hours, a regular account of the height of the eruption, the progress, extent, and direction of the lava, and, in short, the most minute particulars. He also corresponds, as he assured me, with Sir Humphry Davy ;* and is employed to inform him of every interesting phenomenon which takesplaceon the mountain. This man has resided at the foot of it, and been principal guide, for thirty-lhree years, and knows every inch of its territory. As the lava had overflowed the usual footpath leading to that conical eminence which forms the summit of the mountain and the exterior of the crater, we were obliged to alight from our sagacious steeds ; and, trusting to our feet, walked over the ashes for about a quarter of a mile. The path, or the ground rather, for there was no path, was now dangerous to the inexperienced foot ; and Salvador gallantly took me under his peculiar care. He led me on before the rest, and I fol lowed with confidence. Our object was to reach the edge of a stream * Was the letter addressed ' Alia Sua Excellenza Seromfridevi,' which caused so much perplexity at the Post Office and British Museum, and exercised Ihe acu men ofa minister of state, from Salvador to his illustrious correspondent?"], [115, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 103 of lava, formed of two currents united in a point. It was glowing with an intense heat ; and flowing, not with such rapidity as to alarm us, but ralher slowly, and by fits and starts. Trickling, in short, is the word which expresses its motion : if one can fancy it applied to any object on so large a scale. At this time the eruption was at its extreme height. The column of fire was from a quarter to a third of a mile high ; and the stones were thrown up to the height of a mile and a quarter. I passed close to a rock about four feet in diameter, which had rolled down some time before : it was still red-hot, and I stopped to warm my hands at it. At a short distance from it lay another stone or rock, also red-hot, but six times the size. I walked on first with Salvador, till we were within a few yards of Ihe lava \u2014 at this moment a prodigious stone, fol- lowed by two or three smaller ones, came rolling down upon us with terrific velocity. The gentlemen and guides all ran ; my first im- pulse was lo run loo ; but Salvador called on me to stop and see what direction the stone would take. I saw Ihe reason of this advice, and stopped. In- less than a second he seized my arm and hurried me back five or six yards. I heard the whizzing sound of the stone as it rushed down behind me. A little further on it met with an impedi- ment, against which it bolted with such force, lhat it flew up into the air to a great height, and fell in a shower of red-hot fragments. All this passed in a moment; I have shuddered since when I thought of that moment ; but at the time, I saw the danger without the slightest sensation of terror. I remember the ridiculous figures of the men, as they scrambled over the ridges of scoria ; and was struck by Salvador's exclamation, who shouted to them in a tone which would have become C\u00e6sar himself, \u2014 \" Che tema ! \u2014 Sono Salvador !\"* We did not attempt lo turn back again : which I should have done without any hesitation if any one had proposed it. To have come thus far, and be so near the object I had in view, and then to run away at the first alarm ! It was a little provoking. The road was extremely dangerous in the descent. I was obliged to walk part of the way, as the guides advised, and but for Salvador, and the interesting informa tion he gave me from time to time, I think I should have been over powered. He amused and fixed my attention, by his intelligent con versation, his assiduity, and solicitude for my comfort, and the naivete and self-complacency with which his information was conveyed. He told me he had visited Mount \u00c6tna sen amateur) during the last great eruption of lhat mountain, and acknowledged with laudable candour, lhat Vesuvius, in its grandest moments, was a mere bonfire in compa rison : the whole cone of Vesuvius, he said, was not larger lhan somu Quid times ? 8.c."], [116, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 104 of the masses of rock he had seen whirled from the crater of Mount \u00c6tna, and rolling down ils sides. He frequently made mo stop and look back : and here I should observe that our guides seemed as proud of the performances of the mountain, and as anxious to show it off to the' best advantage, as the keeper of a menagerie is of the tricks of his dancing bear, or the proprietor of \"Solomon in all his glory\" of his raree-show. Their enthusiastic shouts and exclamations would have kept up my interest had it flagged. \" 0 veda, Signora ! 0 bella ! 0 stupenda !\" The last great burst of fire was accompanied by a fresh overflow of lava, which issued from the crater, on the west side, in two broad streams, and united a few hundred feet below, taking the direction of Torre del Greco. After this explosion the eruption sub sided, and the mountain seemed to repose : now and then showers of stones flew up, but to no great height, and unaccompanied by any vivid flames. There was a dull red light over the mouth of the cra ter, round which the smoke rolled in dense tumultuous volumes, and then blew off towards the south-west. After a slow and difficult descent we reached the Hermitage. I was so exhausted that I was glad to rest for a few minutes. My good friend Salvador brought me a glass oWachry ma Christi and the leg ofachicken; and wilh recruited spirits we mounted our animals and again started. The descent was infinitely more slow and difficult than the ascent, and much more trying to the nerves. I had not Salvador at my side, nor the mountain before me, to beguile me from my fears ; at length I prevailed on one of our attendants, a fine tall figure of a man, losing to me ; and though he had been up the mountain six times in the course of the day, he sang delightfully and with great spirit and expression, as he strided along with his hand upon my bridle, accompanied by a magnificent rumbling bass from the mountain, which every now and then drowned the melody of his voice, and made me start. It was past three when we reached Resina, and nearly five when we gothome : yet I rose this morning at my usual hour, and do not feel much fa tigued. About twelve to-day I saw Mount Vesuvius, looking as quiet and placid as the first time I viewed it. There was little smoke, and neither the glowing lava nor the flames were visible in the glare of the sunshine. The atmosphere was perfectly clear, and as I gazed, almost misdoubting my senses, I could scarcely believe in the reality of the tremendous scene I had witnessed but a few hours before. 26. \u2014 The eruption burst forth again to-day, and is exceedingly grand ; though not equal to what it was on Sunday night. The smoke rises from the crater in dense black masses, and the wind having veered a few points to the southward, it is now driven in the direction of Naples. Al the moment I write this, the skies are obscured by rolling vapours, and the sun, which is now setting just opposite to"], [117, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 105 Vesuvius, shines, as I have seen him through a London mist, red, and shorn of his beams. The sea is angry and discoloured ; the day most oppressively sultry, and the atmosphere thick, sulphureous, and loaded wilh an almost impalpable dust, which falls on the paper as I write. March k. \u2014 We have had delicious weather almost ever since we arrived at Naples, but these last three days have been perfectly hea venly. I never saw or felt any thing like the enchantment of the earth, air, and skies. The mountain has been perfectly still, the at mosphere without a single cloud, the fresh verdure bursting forth all around us, and every breeze visits the senses,, as if laden with a reno vating spirit of life, and wafted from Elysium. Whoever would truly enjoy nature, should see her in this delicious land : \" oiila plus douce nuit succede au plus beau jour ;\" for here she seems to keep holiday all theyear round. To stand upon my balcony, looking out upon the sunshine and the glorious bay ; the blue sea, and the pure skies \u2014 and to feel that indefinite sensation of excitement, that superflu de vie, quick ening every pulse and thrilling through every nerve, is a pleasure pe culiar to this climate, where the mere consciousness of existence is happiness enough. Then evening comes on, lighted by a moon and starry heavens, whose softness, richness, and splendour, are not to be conceived by those who have lived always in the vapoury atmosphere of England \u2014 dear England ! I love, like an Englishwoman, its fire side enjoyments, and home-felt delights : an English drawing-room, with all its luxurious comforts \u2014 carpets and hearth-rugs, curtains let down, sofas wheeled round, and a group of family faces round a blaz ing fire, is a delightful picture ; but for the languid frame, and the sick heart, give me this pure elastic air, \" redolent of spring;\" this reviving sunshine and all the witchery of these deep blue skies ! \u2014 _ * * * * Ae * Numbers of people set off post-haste from Rome to see the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and arrived here Wednesday and Thursday ; just time enough to be too late. Among them our Roman friend Frattino, who has afforded me more amusement than all our other acquaintance together, and deserves a niche in my gallery of characters. Frattino is a young Englishman , who, if he were in England, would probably be pursuing his studies at Eton or Oxford, for he is scarce past the age of boyhood; but having been abroad since he was twelve years old, and early plunged into active and dissipated life, he is an ac complished man of fashion, and of the world, with as many airs and caprices as a spoiled child. He is by far Ihe most beautiful creature of his sex I ever saw ; so like the Antinous, that at Rome he went by that name. The exquisite regularity of his features, the graceful air of his head, his antique curls, the faultless proportions of his elegant fi gure, make hi ma thing to be gazed on, \"as one looks at a statue. Then he"], [118, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 106 possesses talents, wit, taste, and information : the most polished and captivating manners, where he wishes to attract,\u2014 high honour and generosity, wiiere women are not concerned,\u2014 and all the advantages attending on rank and wealth : but under this fascinating exterior, I suspect our Frattino to be a very worthless, as well as a very un happy being. While he pleases, he repels me. There is a want of heart about him, a want of fixed principles\u2014 a degree of profligacy, of selfishness, of fickleness, caprice and ill-temper, and an excess of va nity, which all his courtly address and savoir faire cannot hide. What would be insufferable in.another, is in him bearable, and even interest ing and amusing : such is the charm of manner. But all this cannot last : and I should not be surprised to see Frattino, a few years hence, emerge from his foreign frippery, throw aside his libertine folly, as sume his seat in the senate, and his rank in British society ; and be the very character he now affects to despise and ridicule\u2014 \"a true-bred Englishman, who rides a thorough-bred horse.\" * \u25a0* * Our excursion to Pompeii yesterday was \" a pic-nic party of pleasure,\" a I'Anglaise. Now a party of pleasure is proverbially a bore : and our expedition was in the beginning so unpromising, so mismanaged\u2014 our party so numerous, and composed of such a heterogeneous mixture of opposite tempers, tastes, and characters, thai I was in pain for the result. The day, however, turned out more pleasant than I expected : exterior polish supplied the want of something better, and our excursion had its pleasures, though they were not such as I should have sought at Pompeii. I felt myself a simple unit among many, and found it easier to sympathise with others, than to make a dozen others sympa thise with me. We were twelve in number, distributed in three light barouches, and reached Pompeii in about two hours and a half \u2014 passing by the foot of Vesuvius, through Portici, Torre del Greco, and l'Annonziata. The streams of lava, which overwhelmed Torre del Greco in 179A, are still black and barren ; but the town itself is rising from its ruins; and the very lava which destroyed it serves as the material to rebuild it. We entered Pompeii by the street of the tombs : near them are the semicircular seats, so admirably adapted for conversation, lhat I wonder we have not sofas on a similar plan, and similar scale. I need not dwell on particulars, which are to be found in every book of travels : on the whole, my expectations were surpassed, though my curiosity was not half gratified. The most interesting thing I saw \u2014 in fact the only thing, for which paintings and descriptions had not previously prepared me, was a build ing which has been excavated within the last fortnight : it is only partly laid open, and labourers are now al work upon it. Antiquarians"], [119, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 107 have not yet pronounced on its name and design ; but I should' imagine it to be some public edifice, perhaps dedicated to religious purposes. The paintings on the walls are Ihe finest which have yet been discover ed : they are exquisitely and tastefully designed ; and though executed merely for effect, that effect is beautiful. I remarked one female fi gure in the act of entering a half-open door : she is represented with pencils and a palette of colours in her hand, similar lo those which artists now use : another very graceful female holds a lyre of pe culiar construction. These, I presume, were two of the muses : the rest remained hidden. There were two small pannels occupied by sea-pieces, with gallies; and two charming landscapes, so well co loured, and drawn with such knowledge of perspective and effect, that if we may form a comparative idea of the best pictures, from the spe cimens of taste and skill in mere house-painting, the ancients must have excelled us as much in painting as in sculpture. I remarked on the wall of an entrance or corridor, a dog starting at a wreathed and crested snake, vividly coloured, and full of spirit and expression. While I lingered here a little behind the rest, and most reluctant to depart, a ragged lazzarone boy came up to me, and seizing my dress, pointed to a corner, and made signs that he had something to show me. I fol lowed him to a spot where a quantity of dust and ashes was piled against a wall. He began to scratch away this heap of dirt with hands and nails, much after the manner of an ape, every now and then looking up in my face and grinning. The impediment being cleared away, there appeared on the wall behind, a most beautiful aerial figure wilh floating drapery, representing either Fame or Victory : but before I had time to examine it, the little rogue flung the earth up again so as to conceal it completely, then pointing significantly at the other workmen , he nodded , shrugged, gesticulated, and held out both his paws for a recompense, which I gave him willingly ; at the same time laughing and shaking my head to show I understood his knavery. I rewarded him appa rently beyond his hopes, for he followed me down the street, bowing, grinning, and cutting capers like a young savage. The streets of Pompeii are narrow, the houses are very small, and the rooms, though often decorated with exquisite taste, are constructed without any regard to what we should term comfort and convenience ; they are dark, confined, and seldom communicate with each other, but have a general communication with a porlico, running round a central court. This court is in general beautifully paved with mosaic, having a fountain or basin in the middle, and possibly answered the purpose of a drawing-room. It is evident lhat the ancient inhabitants of this lovely country lived like their descendants mostly in the open air, and met together in their public walks, or in the forums, and theatres. If they saw company, Ihe guests probably assembled under the porticoes,"], [120, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 108 or in the court round the fountain. The houses seem constructed on the same principle as birds construct their nests ; as places of retreat and shelter, rather than of assemblage and recreation : the grand object was to exclude the sunbeams; and this, which gives such gloomy and chilling ideas in our northern climes, must here have been delicious. Hurried on by a hungry, noisy, merry party, we at length reached the Caserna (the ancient barracks, or as Forsyth will have it, the pr\u00e6 torium). The central court of this building has been converted into a garden : and here, under a weeping willow, our dinner table was spread. Where Englishmen are, there will be good cheer if possible ; and our banquet was in trulh most luxurious. Besides more substantial cates, we had oysters from Lake Lucrine, and classically excellent they were ; London bottled porter, and half a dozen different kinds of wine. Our dinner went off most gaily, but no order was kept afterwards: the pur pose of our expedition seemed to be forgotten in general mirth : many witty things were said and done, and many merry ones, and not a few silly ones. We visited the beautiful public walk and the platform of the old temple of Hercules (I call it old, because it was a ruin when Pompeii was entire) ; the Temple of Isis, the Theatres, the Forum, the Basilica, the Amphitheatre, which is in a perfect state of preservation, and more elliptical in form than any of those I have yet seen, and the School of Eloquence, where R * * mounted the rostrum, and gave us an oration extempore, equally pithy, classical and comical. About sun set we got into the carriages, and returned to Naples. Of all the heavenly days we have had since we came to Naples, this has been the most heavenly : and of all the lovely scenes I have beheld in Italy, what I saw to-day has most enchanted my senses and imagination. The view from the eminence on which the old temple stood, and which was anciently the public promenade, was splendidly beautiful, the whole landscape was at one time overflowed with light and sunshine, and appeared as if seen through an impalpable but daz zling veil. Towards evening the outlines became more distinct: the little white towns perched upon the hills, the gentle sea, the fairy island of Riveglianowith its old tower, Ihe smoking crater of Vesuvius, the bold forms of Mount Lactarius and Cape Minerva, stood out full and clear under the cloudless sky : as we returned, I saw the sun sink behind Capri, which appeared by some optical illusion like a glorious crimson transparency suspended above the horizon : the sky, the earth, the sea, were flushed with the richest rose colour, which gradually softened and darkened into purple : the short twilight faded away, and the full moon, rising over Vesuvius, lighted up the scenery with a softer radiance. Thus ended a day which was not without its pleasures : \u2014 yet had I planned a parly of pleasure to Pompeii, methinks I could have ma-"], [121, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 109 naged better. Parexemple, I would have deferred it a fortnight later, or till the vines were in leaf; I would have chosen for my companions Iwo or at most three persons whom I could name, whose cultivated minds and happy tempers would have heightened their own enjoyment and mine. After spending a few hours in taking a general view of the whole city, we would have sat down on Ihe platform of the old Greek Temole which commands a view of the mountains and Ihe bay ; or, if the heat were too powerful, under the shade of the hill near it. There we would make our cheerful and elegant repast, on bread and fruits, and perhaps a bottle of Malvoisie or Champagne : the rest of the day should be devoted to a minute examination of the principal objects of interest and curiosity : we would wait till the shadows of evening had begun to steal over the scene, purpling Ihe mountains and the sea ; we would linger there to enjoy all the splendours of an Italian sunset ; and then, with minds softened and elevated by the loveliness and solem nity ofthe scenes around, we would get into our carriage, and drive back to Naples beneath the bright full moon; and, by the way, we would \" talk the flowing heart,\" and make our recollections of the olden time, our deep impressions of the past, heighten our enjoyment of the present : and this would be indeed a day of pleasure, of such pleasure as I think I am capable of feeling \u2014 of imparting \u2014 of remem bering with unmixed delight. Such was not yesterday. M** brought with him this evening, for our amusement, an old man, a native of Cento, who gains his livelihood by a curious exhibi tion of his peculiar talents. He is blind, and plays well on the violin : he can recite the whole of the Gerusalemme from beginning to end without missing a word : he can repeat any given stanza or number of stanzas either forwards or backwards : he can repeat Ihe last words one after another of any stanzas : if you give him the first word and the last, he can name immediately the particular line, stanza, and book : lastly, he can tell instantly the exact number of words contained in any given stanza. This exhibition was at first amusing ; but as I soon found that the man's head was a mere machine, lhat he was destitute of imagination, and lhat far from feeling the beauty of the poet, he did not even understand the meaning of the lines he thus repeated up and down, and backwards and forwards, it ceased lo interest me after the first sensations of surprise and curiosity were over. After I had read Italian with Signior B * * this evening, he amused me exceedingly by detailing to me the plan of two tragedies he is now writing or about to write. He has already produced one piece on the story of Boadicea, which is rather a drama lhan a regular tragedy."], [122, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 110 It was acted here with great success. After giving his drama due praise, I described lo him the plan and characters of Fletcher's Bon duca; and attempted lo give him in Italian some idea of the most striking scenes of that admirable play : he was alternately in enchant ment and despair, and I thought he would have torn and bitten his Boadicea to pieces, in the excess of his vivacity. The subject of one of his tragedies is to be the Sicilian Vespers. CasimirDelavigne, who wrote Les VepresSiciliennes, which obtained some years ago such amazing popularity at Paris, and in which the national vanity of the French is flattered at the expense of the Italians, received a pension from Louis XVIII. B * * spoke with contempt of Casimir Delavigne's tragedy, and with indignation of whal he called \" his wilful misrepresentation of history.\" He is determined to give the reverse of the picture : the French will be represented as \" gente crudeli \u2014 tiranni \u2014 oppressors senzafede ,-\" Giovanni di Procida, as a hero and patriot, a [antique, and the Sicilians as rising in defence of Iheir freedom and national honour. The other tragedy is to be sounded on the hislory of the famous Congiura del Baroni in the reign of Ferdinand the First, as related by Giannone. The simple fads of this history need not any ornaments, borrowed from invention or poetry, to form a most interesting tale, and furnish ample materials for a beautiful tragedy, in incident, characters, and situations. B* * is a little man, dwarfish and almost deformed in person; but full of talent, spirit, and enthusiasm. I asked him why he did not immedi ately finish these tragedies, which appeared from the sketches he had given me, so admirably calculated to succeed. He replied, that under the present regime, he dared not write up to his own conceptions ; and if he curbed his genius, he could do nothing ; \" Besides,\" added he mournfully, \" I have no lime; I am poor \u2014 poverissimo! I must work hard all to-day to supply the wants of to-morrow : I am al ways surveille by the police, as a known liberal and literato.'' \" Davvero,\" added he, gaily, \" I would soon do, or say, or write something to attract the honour of their more particular notice, if I could be certain they would only imprison me for a couple of years, and ensure me during lhat lime a blanket, bread and water, and the use of pen and ink : then I would write ! I would write ! dalla mat tina alia sera; and thank my gaolers as my best friends : but pens are poignards, ink is poison in the eyes of the present government; imprisonment for life, or banishment, is the least I could expect. Now the mere idea of imprisonment for life would kill me in a week, and banishment I\u2014 Ah lungi dalld mia bella Patria, come cantare! come scrivere > come vivere ! moriro io anzi neW momenta di partire I\""], [123, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 111 I drove to-day, tete-a-lete with Laura, to Ihe Lago d'Agnano, about a mile and a half beyond Pausilippo. This lovely fair lake is not more than two miles in circuit; and embosomed in romantic woody hills: innumerable flocks of wild fowl were skimming over its surface, and gave life and motion to the beautiful but quiet landscape. While we were wandering here, enjoying the stillness and solitude, so de lightfully contrasted with the unceasing noise, bustle, and crowd of the city, the charm was rudely broken by the appearance of the king ; who, attended by a numerous party of his guards and huntsmen, had been wild boar shooting in Ihe neighbouring woods. The water fowl, scared by the report of sire arms, speedily disappeared, and the guards shouted to each other, and galloped round the smooth sloping banks; culling up the turf with Iheir horses' hoofs, and deforming the whole scene wilh uproar, confusion, and affright. Devoutly did I wish them all twenty miles off. The famous Grotlo del Cane is on the south bank ofthe lake, a few yards from the edge of Ihe water. We saw the torch, when held in the vapour, instantaneously extinguished. The ground all around the entrance of the grotto is hot to the touch ; and when I plunged my hand into the deleterious gas, which rises about a foot, or a foot and a half, above the surface of Ihe ground, it was so warm I was glad to withdraw it. The disagreeable old woman who showed us this place, brought with her a wretched dog wilh a rope round his neck, bleared eyes, thin ribs, and altogether of a most pitiful aspect. She was most anxious to exhibit the common but cruel experiment of suspended animation, by holding his head over the mephitic vapour, insisting that he was accustomed to it, and even liked it ; of course, we would not suffer it. The poor animal made no resistance ; only drooped his head, and put his tail between his legs, when his tyrant attempted to seize him. Though now so soft, so lovely, and so tranquil, Ihe Lago d'Agnano owes its existence to some terrible convulsion of the elements. The basin is the crater of a sunken volcano, which, bursting forth here, swallowed up a whole city. And the whole region round, bears evi dent marks of its volcanic origin. This morning we visited several churches, not one of them worthy ofa remark. The architecture is invariably in the vilest taste; and Ihe interior decorations, if possible, still worse : white-washing gilding, and gaudy colours, every where prevail. We saw, however, some good pictures. At the San Gennaro are the famous frescos of Domenichino and Lanfranco : the church itself is hideous. At the Girolomini there is no wani of magnificence and ornament ; but a barbarous misapplication of both, as usual. The church of Ihe convent of Santa Chiara was painted in fresco byGhiolto: it is now white-"], [124, "112 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. washed all over. At this church, which I first visited during the merry days of the carnival, I saw a large figure of our Saviour sus pended on the cross, dressed in a crimson domino, and blue sash. To what a pitch, thought I, must the love of white-washing and masque rading be carried in this strange city, where the Deity himself is bur lesqued, and bad taste is carried to profanation ! To-day I saw the same crucifix in a suit of mourning ; why should nol our South Sea missionaries come and preach here ? The church of San Severo is falling to ruins, owing to some defect in the architecture. It is only remarkable for containing three cele brated statues. The man enveloped in a net, and the Pudicita, draped from head to foot, pleased me only as specimens of the patience and ingenuity of the sculptor. The dead Christ covered with a veil, by Corradini, has a merit of a higher class : it is most painful to look upon ; and affected me so strongly, that I was obliged to leave the church, and go into the air. I went to-day with two agreeable and intelligent friends, to take leave of the Studeo and Ihe Museum. I have often resolved not to make my little journal a mere catalogue of objects, which are lo be found in my pocket guide, and bought fora few pence; but I cannot resist the temptation of making a few notes of admiration, and comme moration, for my own peculiar use. The Gallery of Painting contains few pictures ; but among them are some master-pieces. The St. John of Leonardo da Vinci (exquisite asit is, considered as a mere painting), provoked me. I am sick of his eternal simpering face : the aspect is that of a Ganymede or a young Bacchus ; and if instead otEcce Agnus Dei, they had written over it, Ecce vinum bonum, all would have been in character. How I coveted the beautiful \" Carita,\" the Capo d' Opera of Schi done ! \u2014 and next to it, Parmegiano's Gouvernante \u2014 a delicious pic ture. A portrait of Columbus, said to be by the same master, is not like him, I am sure ; for the physiognomy is vacant and disagreeable. Domenichino's large picture of the Angel shielding Innocence from a Demon pleases me, as all his pictures do \u2014 but not perfectly : the devil in Ihe corner, with his fork, and hoofs, and horns, shocks my taste as a ludicrous and vulgar idea, far removed from poetry ; but the figure of Ihe angel stretching a shield over the infant, is charming. There are also two sine Claudes, two Holy Families, by Raffaelle, in his sweetest style ; and one by Correggio, scarcely less beautiful. The Gallery of Sculpture is so rich in chef-d'\u0153uvres, that to parti cularise would be a vain attempt. Passing over those which every one knows by heart, the statue of Aristides struck me most. It was found in Herculaneum; and is marked with ferruginous stains, as if by the action of fire or the burning lava ; but it is otherwise uninjured,"], [125, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 113 and the grave, yet graceful simplicity of the figure and attitude, and Ihe extreme elegance of the drapery, are truly Grecian. It is the union of power with repose \u2014 of perfect grace with perfect simplicity, which dis tinguishes the ancient from the modern style of sculpture. The sitting Agrippina, for example, furnished Canova with the model for his statue of Madame Lelitia \u2014 the two statues are, in point of fact, nearly the same, except that Canova has turned Madame Lelitia's head a little on one side ; and by this single and trifling alteration has destroyed that quiet and beautiful simplicity which distinguishes the original, and given his statue at once a modern air. The Flora Farnese is badly placed, in a space too confined for its size, and too near the eye ; so that the exquisite harmony and delicacy of the figure are partly lost in its colossal proportions : it should be placed at the end of a long gallery or vista. There is here a statue of Nero when he was ten years old ; from which it would seem that he was not by nature the monster he after wards became. The features are beautiful ; and the expression all candour and sweetness. One statue struck me exceedingly \u2014 not by the choice of the subject, nor the beauty of the workmanship, but from its wonderful force of expression. It is a dying gladiator; but very different from the gla diator of the Capitol. The latter declines gradually, and sickens into death ; but memory and feeling are not yet extinct : and what thoughts may pass through that brain while life is thus languishing away ! what emotions may yet dwell upon the last beatings of that heart ! it is the sentiment which gives such profound pathos to lhat matchless statue : but the gladiator of the Studii has only physical expression : it is sudden death in all its horrors : Ihe figure is still erect, though Ihe mortal blow has been given ; the sword has dropt from the powerless hand ; the limbs are stiffening in death ; the eyes are glazed ; the fea tures fixed in an expression of mortal agony ; and in another moment you expect the figure to fall at your feet. The Venus, the Hercules, the Atlas, the Antinous (not equal to that in the Capitol,) the Ganymede, the Apollo, the equestrian statues of Ihe two Balbi, etc. are all familiar to my imagination, from Ihe numerous copies and models I have seen : but the most interesting department of the Museum is the collection of antiques from Herculaneum and Pom peii, which have lately been removed hither from Portici. One room contains specimens of cooking utensils, portable kitchens, tripods, in struments of sacrifice, small bronze Lares, and Penates, urns, lamps, and candelabras of the most elegant forms, and the most exquisite workmanship. Another room contains specimens of ancient armour, children's toys, etc. I remarked here a helmet which I imagine formed part of a trophy; or at least was intended for ornament rather s"], [126, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 114 than use. Il is exceedingly heavy ; and on it is represented in the most exquisite relievo the War of Troy. Benvenuto Cellini himself never produced any thing equal to the chased work on this helmet. In a third room is the paraphernalia ofa lady's toilette : mirrors of different sizes, fragments of combs, a small crystal box of rouge, etc. Then follow flutes and pipes, all carved out of bone, surgical instruments, moulds forpastry , sculptors' tools, locks and keys, bells.etc. The room containing the antique glass, astonished me more than any thing else. I knew that glass was an ancient invention : but I thought lhat its application to domestic purposes was of modern date. Here I found window panes, taken from the Villa of Diomed at Pompeii ; bottles of every size and form, white and coloured ; pitchers and vases; necklaces; imitations of gems, etc. There is a litlle jeu d'esprit of Voltaire's \" La Toilette de Madame de Pompadour,\" in which he w'itlily exalts the moderns above the an cients, and ridicules Iheir ignorance of the luxuries and comforts of life : but Voltaire had not seen the museum of Portici. We can add few distinct articles to the list of comforts and luxuries it contains : though it must be confessed lhat we have improved upon them, and varied them ad infinitum. In those departments of the mechanics which are iu any way connected wilh the sine arts, the ancients ap pear to have attained perfection. To them belongs Ihe invention of all lhat embellishes life, of all the graceful forms of imitative art, varied with such exquisite taste, such boundless fertility of fancy, thai nothing is left to us but to refine upon their ideas, and copy their creations. With all our new invented machines, and engines, we can do little more lhan what the ancients performed without them. I ought not to forget one room containing some objects, more curious and amusing lhan beautiful, principally from Pompeii, such as loaves of bread, reduced to a black cinder, figs in the same state, grain of different kinds, colours from a painter's room, ear-rings and bracelets, gems, specimens of mosaic, etc. etc. March 7.\u2014 Frattinto brought me lo-day the last numbers of the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews: a great treat so far from home. Both contain some clever essays : among them, an article on prisons, in the Edinburgh, interested me most. Methinks these two Reviews slalk through the literary world, like the two giants in Pulci's Morganle Maggiore: the one pounding, slay ing, mangling, despoiling wilh blind fury, like the heavy orthodox club-armed Morgante ; the other, like the sneering, willy, half-pagan, half-baptized Margutte, slashing and cutting, and piercing through thick and thin ; a tort et a, travers. Truly the simile is more Apropos than I thought when it sirst occurred to me."], [127, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 115 I went the other day to a circulating library and reading-room kept here by a little cross French-woman, and asked to see a catalogue. She showed me, first, a list of all the books, Italian, French, and Eng lish, she was allowed to keep and sell : it was a thin pamphlet of about one hundred pages. She then showed me the catalogue of prohibited books, which was at least as thick as a good sized octavo. The book to which I wished to refer, was the second volume of Robertson's Charles the Fifth. After some hesilation, Madame P * * led me into a back room ; and opening a sliding pannel, discovered a shelf let inlo the wall, on which were arranged a number of authors, chiefly Eng lish and French. I was not surprised to find Rousseau and Voltaire among them ; but am still at a loss to guess what Robertson hasdone or written to entitle him to a place in such select company. 8th. \u2014 Forsyth might well say lhat Naples has no parallel on earlh. Viewed from the sea it appears like an amphitheatre of palaces, tem ples and castles, raised one above another, by Ihe wand of a necro mancer : viewed within, Naples gives me the idea of avast Bartholomew fair. No street in London is ever so crowded as I have seen the streets of Naples. It is a crowd which has no pause or cessation : early in the morning, late at night, it is ever the same. The whole population seems poured into the streets and squares ; all business and amuse ment is carried on in the open air : all those minute details of domestic life, which, in England, are confined within the sacred precincts of home, are here displayed to public view. Here people buy and sell, and work, wash, wring, brew, bake, fry, dress, eat, drink, sleep, etc. etc. all in the open streets. We see every hour, such comical, in describable appalling sights ; such strange figures, such wild phy siognomies, picturesque dresses, attitudes and groups \u2014 and eyes \u2014 no ! I never saw such eyes before, as I saw to-day, half languor and half fire, in the head of a ruffian Lazzarone, and a ragged Calabrian beggar girl. They would have embrdse half London or Paris. I know not whether it be incipient illness, or the enervating effects of this soft climate, but I feel unusually weak, and the least exertion or excitement is not only disagreeable but painful. While the rest were at Capo di Monte, I stood upon my balcony looking out upon the lovely scene before me, with a kind of pensive dreamy rapture, which if not quite pleasure, had at least a power to banish pain : and thus hours passed away insensibly \u2014 \" As if the moving time had been A thing as stedfast as the scene, On which we gazed ourselves away.\"* * Wordsworth. S\""], [128, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 116 All my activity of mind, all my faculties of thought and seeling and suffering, seemed lost and swallowed up in an indolent delicious re verie, a sort of vague and languid enjoyment, the true \"dolce far niente\" of this enchanting climate. I stood so long leaning on my elbow without moving, that my arm has been stiff all day in con- sequence. \"Howl wish,\" said I this evening, when they drew aside the curtain, that I might view the sunset from my sofa, and sky, earth and ocean, seemed to commingle in floods of glorious light \u2014 \"how I wish I could transport those skies to England !\" Cruelle ! exclaimed an Italian behind me, otez-nous notre beau ciel, tout est perdu pour nous. THE LAST EVENING AT NAPLES Yes, Laura ! draw the shade aside And let me gaze \u2014 while yet I may, Upon that gently heaving tide, Upon that glorious sun-lit bay. Land of Romance ! enchanting shore ! Fair scenes, near which I linger yet ! Never shall I behold ye more, Never this last \u2014 last look forget !

Velletri, 3Jarch 13. \u2014 It is now a week since I opened my little book. Ever since the 9th I have been seriously ill : and yesterday morning I left Naples still low and much indisposed, but glad of a change which should substitute any external excitement, however painful, to that unutterable dying away of the heart and paralysis of Ihe mind which I have suffered for some days past. When we turned into the Strada Chiaja, and I gave a last glance at the magnificent bay and the shores all resplendent with golden light, I could almost have exclaimed like Eve, ' ' must I then leave thee, Paradise !\" and dropped a few natural tears \u2014 tears of weakness, rather than of grief: for what do I leave behind me worthy one emotion of regret ? Even at Naples, even in this all-lovely land, \" sit haunt for gods,\" has it not been with me as it has been elsewhere? as long as the excitement of change and novelty lasts, my heart can turn from itself \"to luxuriate with in different things:\" but it cannot last long; and when it is over, I suffer, I am ill : the past returns with tenfold gloom ; interposing like a dark shade between me and every object : an evil power seems to"], [129, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 117 reside in every thing I see, to torment me with painful associations, lo perplex my faculties, to irritate and mock me with Ihe perception of what is lost to me : the very sunshine sickens me, and I am forced to confess myself weak and miserable as ever. 0 time ! how slowly you move ! how little you can do for me 1 and how bitter is that sorrow which has no relief to hope but from time alone ! Last night we reached Mola di Gaeta, which looked even more beautiful than before, in the eyes of all but one, whose senses were blinded and dulled by dejection, lassitude, and sickness. When I felt myself passively led along the shore, placed where the eye might range at freedom over the living and rejoicing landscape \u2014 when I heard myself repeating mechanically the exclamations of others, and felt no ray of beauty, no sense of pleasure penetrate to my heart \u2014 shall I own, even to myself, the mixture of anguish and terror with which I shrunk back, conscious of the waste within me 1 The con viction that now it was all over, that the last and only pleasures hitherto left to me had perished, that my mind was contracted by the selfishness of despondency, and my quick spirit of enjoyment utterly subdued into apathy, gave me for a moment a pang sharper than if a keen knife had cut me to the quick ; and then I relapsed into a kind of torpid languor of mind and frame, which I thought was resignation, and as such indulged it. From my bed this morning I stepped out upon my balcony just as the sun was rising. I wished to convince myself whether the beauty on which I had lately looked with such admiration and delight, had indeed lost all power to touch my heart. The impression made upon my mind at lhat instant I can only compare to the rolling away of a palpable and suffocating cloud : every thing on which I looked had the freshness and brightness of novelty : a glory beyond its own was again diffused over the enchanting scene from the stores of my own imagination : the sea breeze which blew against my temples new strung every nerve ; and I left Mola with a heart so lightened and so grateful, that not for hours afterwards, not till fatigue and hurry had again wearied down my spirits, did that impression of happy thank fulness pass away. I am sensible I owed this sudden renovation of health solely to the contemplation of Nature; and a true feeling for all the \"maggior pompa\" she has poured forth over this glorious region.

In England there is a peculiar charm in the soft aerial perspective, which even in the broadest glare of noonday, blends and masses the forms of the distant landscape; and in that mingling of colours into a cool neutral gray tint so grateful to the eye. Hence il has happened that in some of the Italian pictures I have seen in England, I have often been struck by what appeared to me a vio lence in the colouring, and a sharp decision in the outline, o'erstep ping the modesty of nature\u2014 that is, of English nature : but there is in this climate a prismatic splendour of tint, a glorious all-embracing light, a vivid distinctness of outline, something in the reality more gorgeous, glowing, and luxuriant, than poetry could dare to express, or painting imitate. \" Ah that such beauty, varying in the light Of living nature, cannot be portrayed By words, nor by the pencil's silent skill ; But is the property of those alone Who have beheld it, noted it with care, And in their minds recorded it with love.\" Wordsworth.

The most horrible places we have yet met with are Ilri and Fondi, which look like recesses of depravity and dirt, and the houses more like the dens and kennels of wild beasts, than the habitations of civilized human beings. In fact, the populace of these towns consists chiefly of the families of the briganti. The women we saw here were bold coarse Amazons ; and the few men who appeared had a slouching gait, and looked at us from under their eyebrows with an expression at once cunning and fierce. Wet met many begging friars \u2014 horrible speci mens of their species : altogether I never beheld such a desperate set of canaille as appear to have congregated in these two wretched towns. At Mola I remarked several beautiful women. Their bead-dre9s is singularly graceful : the hair being plaited round the back of the head, and there fastened with two silver pins, much in the manner of some of Ihe ancient slatues. The costume of the peasantry, there, and all the way to Rome, is very striking and picturesque.

We have now a suite of apartments in the Hotel d' Europe; and our accommodations are in all respects excellent, almost equal to Schneiderf's at Florence. On entering Rome through the gate of the Lateran, I was struck by the emptiness and stillness of Ihe streets, contrasted with those of Na ples; and still more by the architectural grandeur and beauty which everywhere met the eye.

After nine in Ihe evening a profound stillness reigns ; and 1 distinguish nothing from my window but the splashing of the Foun tain della Barchetta. The weather is lovely\"; we were obliged to close our Venetian blinds against the heat at eight this morning, and afterwards we drove lo the gardens of the Villa Borghese, where we wandered about in search of coolness and shade. \u2022 26. \u2014 I must now descend to the common occurrences of our every day life.' For the last week we have generally spent the whole or part of the morning, in some of the galleries of art ; and the afternoon in the gardens of the neighbouring villas. Those of the Villa Medici have their vicinity to our inn, and their fine air to recommend them. From the Villa Lanti, and the Monte Mario, we have a splendid view of the whole city and Campagna of Rome. The Pope's gardens on the Monte Cavallo, are pleasant, acessible, and very private : the gardens of the Villa Pamfili, are enchanting ; but our usual haunt is the gar den ofthe Villa Borghese. In this delightful spot we sind shade and privacy, or sunshine and society, as we may feel inclined. To-day it was intensely hot; but we found the cool sequestered walks and al leys of cypress and ilex, perfectly delicious. I spread my shawl upon a green bank carpeted with violets, and lounged in most luxurious in dolence. I had a book with me, but felt no inclination to read. The soft air, the trickling and murmuring of innumerable fountains, the urns, the temples, the statues \u2014 the localities of the scene \u2014 all dispose the mind to a kind of vague but delightful reverie to which we \" find no end, in wandering mazes lost.\" In these gardens we frequently meet the Princess Pauline : some times alone, but oftener surrounded by a cortege of beaux. She is no longer Ihe \" Venere Vincitrice\" of Canova; but her face, though faded, is pretty and intelligent ; and she still preserves the \"andar celeste,\" and all the distinguished elegance of her petite and graceful figure. Of the stories told of her, I suppose one half inay be true and that half is quite enough. She is rather more famous for her gallantries, than for her bon-gout in the choice of her favourites ; but it is justice to Pauline to add, that her native benevolence of heart seems to have survived all her frailties; and every one who speaks of her here, even those who must condemn her, mention her in a tone of kindness, and even of respect. She is still in deep mourning for Ihe Emperor. The Villa Pamfili is about two miles from Rome on the other side of the Monte Gianicolo, The gardens are laid out in the artificial style"], [133, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 121 of Italian gardening, a style which in England would horrify me as in the vilest and most old-fashioned taste\u2014 stiff, cold, unnatural, and altogether detestable. Through what inconsistency or perversity of taste is it then, that I am enchanted with the fantastic elegance, and the picturesque gaiety of the Pamfili gardens ; where sportive art re vels and runs wild amid the luxuriance of nature ? Or is it, as I would rather believe, because these long arcades of verdure, these close walls of laurel, pervious to the air, but impervious to the sunshine, these broad umbrageous avenues and marble terraces, these paved grottoes and ever trickling fountains, these gods and nymphs, and urns and sarcophagi, meeting us at every turn with some classical or poetical as sociation, harmonize with the climate and the country, and the minds of the people ; and are comfortable and consistent as a well carpeted drawing-room and a warm chimney-corner would be in England? \" But it is all so artificial and unnatural \" \u2014 Agreed ; \u2014 so are our yellow unsheltered gravel walks, meandering through smooth shaven lawns, which have no other beauty than that of being dry when every other place is wet; our shapeless flower-beds so elaborately irregular, our clumps and dots of trees, and dwarfish shrubberies. I have seen some over-dressed grounds and gardens in England, the perpetrations of Capability Brown and his imitators, the landscape gardeners, quite as bad as any thing I see here, only in a different style, and certainly more adapted to England and English taste. I must confess, that in these enchanting gardens of the Villa Pamfili, a little less \" ingenuity and artifice\" would be belter. I hate mere tricks and gimcrackery, of which there are a few instances, such as their hydraulic music, jets-d'eau \u2014 water-works that play occasionally to the astonishment of children and the prosit of the gardeners \u2014 but how different, after all, are these Italia-n gardens to the miserable grandeur, and senseless, taste less parade of Versailles! In these gardens an interesting discovery has just been made; an extensive burial place, or columbarium, in singular preservation. The skeletons and ashes have not been removed. Some of the lombsare painted in fresco, others floored with very pretty mosaic. The dispo sition ofthe urns is curious : they are imbedded in the masonry of the wall with moveable lids. On a tile I found the name of Sexlus Pompeius, in letters beautifully formed, and deeply and distinctly cut, and an inscription which I was not Latinist enough to translate accu rately, but from which il appears that these columbaria belonged to a branch of the Pompey family. 27.\u2014 To-day, after English chapel, I took a walk to the San Gre gorio, on the other side of the Palatine, which since I first came to Rome has been to me a favourite and chosen spol. I sat down on the steps of the church lo rest, and enjoy at leisure the sine view of the"], [134, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 122 hill and ruins opposite. Arches on arches, a wilderness of desolation 1 and mingled with massive fragments of the halls and towers of the C\u00e6sars, were young shrubs just putting on iheir brightest green, and the almond-trees covered with their gay blossoms, and the cloudless and resplendent skies bending over all. I tried to sketch the scene before me, hut could not form a stroke. I cannot now take a short walk without seeling its ill effects ; and my hand shook so much from nervous weakness, lhat after a few vain efforts to steady it, I sorrowfully gave up the attempt. On returning home by the Coliseum, and through the Forum and Capitol, I met many things I should wish to remember. After all, what place is like Rome, where it is impossible to move a step without meeting with some incident or object to excite reflection, to enchant the eye, or in terest the imagination ? Rome may yield to Naples or Florence in mere external beauty ; but every other spot on earth, Athens perhaps alone excepted, must yield to Rome in interest. 28. \u2014 This morning we walked down to the studio of Mr. Wage nal, to seethe\u00c6gina marbles ; which, as objects of curiosity, interested me extremely. These statues are on a smaller scale than I expected, being not much more than half the size of life, but of better workman ship, and in a style of sculpture altogether different from any thing I ever saw before. They formed the ornaments of the pediment ofthe Temple of Jupiter in the island of \u00c6gina, and represented a group of fighting and dying warriors, with an armed Pallas in the centre : but the subject is not known: The execution of these statues must evidently be referred to the ear liest ages of Grecian art ; to a period when sculpture was confined to the exact imitation of natural forms. Several of the figures were ex tremely spirited, and very correct both in design and execution ; but there is no attempt at grace, and a tolal deficiency of ideal beauty : in the Pallas, especially, the drapery and forms are but one remove from Ihe cold formal Etruscan slyle, which in its turn is but one remove from the yet more tasteless Egyptian. I think it was at ihe Villa Al bani, I saw the singular Etruscan basso-relievo which I was able to compare mentally with what I saw to-day ; and the resemblance in manner struck me immediately. Thorwaldson is now restoring these marbles in the most admirable style for the King of Bavaria, to whom they were sold by Messrs. Cockerel and Linkh (the original disco verers) for 8000/. Gibson, the celebrated English sculptor, joined us while looking at the \u00c6gina marbles, and accompanied us to Ihe studio of Pozzi, the Florentine statuary. Here I saw several instances of thai affected and meretricious taste which prevails too much among the foreign sculptors."], [135, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 123 1 remember one example almost ludicrous, a female Satyr wilh her hair turned up behind and dressed in the last Parisian fashion; as if she had just come from under the hands of Monsieur Hyppolite. By the same hand which committed this odd solecism, I saw a statue of Moses, now modelling in clay, which, if finished in marble in a style worthy of its conception, and if not spoiled by some affected niceties in the execution, will be a magnificent and sublime work of art. Gibson afterwards showed us round his own studio : his exquisite group of Psyche borne away by the Zephyrs enchanted me. The ne cessity which exists for supporting all the figures has rendered it im possible to give them the same aerial lightness I have seen in paintings ofthe same subject, yet they are all but aerial. Psyche was criticised by two or three of our party ; but I thought her faultless : she is a lovely limid girl ; and as she leans on her airy supporters, she seems to contemplate her flight down the precipice, half-shrinking, though secure. Mr. W * * told me that in the original design, the left foot of one of the Zephyrs rested upon the ground : and that Canova, coming in by chance while Gibson was working on the model, lifted it up, and this simple and masterly alteration has imparted the most exquisite lightness lo the attitude. Gibson was Canova's favourite pupil : he has quite the air of a genius: plain features, but a countenance all beaming with fire, spirit, and intelligence. His Psyche remains slill in the model, as he has not yet found a patron munificent enough to order it in marble ; al which I greatly wonder. Could I but afford to bestow seven hun dred pounds on my own gratification, I would have given him the order on the spot.\" 30. \u2014 Yesterday we dined al fresco in the Pamfili gardens: and though our party was rather too large, it was well assorted, and the day went off admirably. The queen of our feast was in high good humour, and irresistible in charms ; Frattino very fascinating, T * * was caustic and witty, W * * lively and clever, Sir J * * mild, intelli gent, and elegant, V * *, as usual, quiet, sensible, and self-complacent, L * * as absurd and assiduous as ever. Every body played their part well, each by a tacit convention sacrificing to the amour propre ofthe rest. Every individual really occupied with his own particular role, bul all apparently happy, and mutually pleased. Vanity and selfish ness, indifference and ennui, were veiled under a general mask of good humour and good breeding, and the flowery bonds of politeness and gallantry held together those who knew no common tie of thought or interest ; and when parted (as they soon will be, north, south, east, \" It is understood that this beautiful group has since been executed in marble for Sir George Beaumont. \u2014 Editor."], [136, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 124 and wesl), will probably never meet again in this world ; and whether they do or not, who thinks or cares ! Our luxurious dinner, washed down by a competent proportion of Malvoisie and Champagne, were spread upon the grass, which was literally Ihejlowery turf, being covered with violets, iris, and ane mones of every dye. Instead of changing'our plates, we washed them in a beautiful fountain which murmured near us, having first, by a libation, propitiated the presiding nymph for this pollution of her lim pid waters. For my own peculiar taste there were too many servants (who on these occasions are always de trop), too many luxuries, loo much fuss ; but considering the style and number of our party, it was all consistently and admirably managed : Ihe grouping of the com pany, picturesque because unpremeditated, the scenery round, the arcades, and bowers, and columns, and fountains, had an air altogether quite poetical and romantic ; and put me in mind of some of Watteau's beautiful garden-pieces, and Stothard's fetes-champetres. To me the day was not a day of pleasure ; for the small stock of strength and spirits with which I set out was soon exhausted, and the rest of the day was wasted in efforts to appear cheerful and support myself to the end, lesl I should spoil the general mirth : on all I looked with complacency tinged with my habitual melancholy. What I most admired was the delicious view, from an eminence in the wildest part of Ihe gardens, over the city and Campagna to the blue Apen nines, where Frascati and Albano peeped forth like nests of white buildings glittering upon a rich back ground, tinted with blue and pur ple ; Ihe hill where Cato's villa stood, and still called the Porlian Hill, and on the highest point the ruined temple of Jupiter Latialis visible at the distance of seventeen miles, and shining in the setting sun like burnished gold. What I most felt and enjoyed was the luxurious temperature of the atmosphere, Ihe purity and brilliance of the skies, the delicious security with which I threw myself down on the turf without fear of damp and cold, and the thankful consciousness, lhat neither the light or worldly beings round me, nor the sadness which weighed down my own heart, had quite deadened my once quick sense of pleasure, but left me still some perception of Ihe splendour and clas sical interestof the glorious scenes around me, combined as it was with all the enchantment of natural beauty \u2014 \" The music and the bloom And all the mighty ravishment of spring.'"], [137, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 125 TOLSE AI MARTIRI OGNI CONFIN, CHI AL CORE TOGLIER POTEO LA LIBERTA DEL PIANTO !

The bill of fare for this day runs thus : \u2014 \" Domenica delle Palme, nel Capella Papalenel Palazzo Apostolico, canta messa un Cardinal Prete. II Sommo Pontefice fa la benedizione delle Palme, con processione per la Sala Regia.\" I gave up going to the English service accordingly, and consented to accompany R* * and V* * to the Pope's Chapel. We entered just as the ceremony of blessing the palms was going on : a cardinal offi ciated for the poor old pope, who is at present ill. After the palms had been duly blessed, they were carried in pro cession round the splendid anli-chamber, called the Sala Regia ; mean time the chapel doors were closed upon them, and on Iheir return, they (not the palms, but the priests) knocked and demanded entrance in a fine recitative ; two of the principal voices replied from within ; the choir without sung a response, and after a moment's silence Ihe doors were opened, and the service went on. This was very trivial and tedious. Rospo said, very truly, that the procession in Blue Beard was much belter got tip. All these proces sions sound very fine in mere description, but in Ihe reality there is always something to disappoint or disgust ; something which leaves either a ludicrous or a painful impression on the mind.

It is well to see these things once, lhat we may not be cheated with fine words, but judge for ourselves. I foresee, however, that I shall not be tempted to encounter any of the more crowded ceremonies. I remarked lhat all the Italians wore black to-day. We spent the afternoon at the Valican. We found St. Peter's almost deserted ; few people, no music, the pictures all muffled, and (he altars hung with black drapery. The scaffolding was preparing for the ceremonies of the week ; and, on the whole, St. Peter's appeared, for the sirst time, disagreeable and gloomy. Monday, April 1. \u2014 Non riconosco oggi la mia bella Italia ! Clouds, and cold, and rain, to which we have been so long unaccustomed, seem unnatural ; and deform that peculiar character of sunny loveliness which belongs to this country : and, a-propos to climate, I may as well observe now, lhat since the 1st of February, when we left Rome for Naples, up to this present 1st of April, not one day has been so rainy as to confine us to the house : and on referring to my memoranda of ihe weather, I find that at Naples it rained one day for a few hours only, and for about two hours on the morning we left it : since then, not a drop of rain has fallen : all hot, cloudless, lovely weather. We have been for the last three weeks in summer costume, and guard against the heat as we should in England during the dog-days. To have an idea of an Italian summer, Mr. W* * says we must fancy the present heat quadrupled. The day, notwithstanding, has been unusually pleasant, the after noon, thought not brilliant, was clear and soft ; and we drove in Ihe open carriage first to the little church of Santa Maria della Pace, lo see Raffaelle's famous fresco, the Four Sybils. It is in the finest pre servation, and combines all his peculiar graces of design and expres sion. The colouring has not suffered from time and damp like that of the frescos in the Valican, but it is at once brilliant and delicate. Nothing can exceed the exquisite grace of the Sibilla Persica, nor the beautiful drapery and inspired look of the Cumana. Fortunately, I had never seen any copy or engraving of this master piece : its beauty was to me enhanced by surprise and all the charm of novelty : and my gratification was complete. We afterwards spent half an hour in the gardens of the Villa Lanti, on the Monte Gianicolo. The view of Rome from these gardens is superb: though the sky was clouded, Ihe amosphere was perfectly pure and clear : the eye took in the whole extent of ancient and mo-"], [139, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 127 dern Rome j beyond it the Campagna, the Alban Hills, and the Ap pennines, which appeared of a deep purple, with pale clouds floating over their summits. The city lay at our feet, silent, and clothed with the daylight as with a garment \u2014 no smoke, no vapour, no sound, no mo tion, no sign of life : it looked like a city whose inhabitants had been suddenly petrified, or smitten by a destroying angel ; and such was the effect of its strange and solemn beauly, that, before I was aware, I felt my eyes fill with tears as I looked upon it. I saw Naples from theCastle of Saint Elmo \u2014 setting aside the sea and Mount Vesuvius, those unequalled features in that radiant picture \u2014 the view of the city of Naples is not so fine as the view of Rome : it is, comparatively, deficient in sentiment, in interest, and in dignity. Naples wears on her brow the voluptuous beauty of a syren \u2014 Rome sits desolate on her seven-hilled throne, \" the Niobe of Nations.\" I wish I could have painted what I saw lo-day as I saw it.\" Yet no \u2014 the reality was perhaps too much like a picture to please in a picture: Ihe exquisite harmony of the colouring, the softness of the lights and shades, the solemn death-like stillness, the distinctness of every form and outline, and (he classic interest attached to every noble object, combined lo form a scene, which hereafter, in the silence of ray own thoughts, I shall often love to recall and to dwell upon. To-night I read with Incoronati, the Fourth book of Dante, and two of Petrarch's Canzoni \"I' vo pensando,\" and \"Verdi panni,\" making notes from his explanations and remarks as I went along. These two Canzoni I had selected as being among the most puzzling as well as the most beautiful. Those are strangely mistaken, who from a super ficial study of a few of his amatory sonnets, regard Petrarch as a mere love-sick poet, who spent his lime in be-rhyming an obdurate mistress; and those are equally mistaken who consider him as the poetical votarist of an imaginary fair one. I know but little, even of the little that is known of his life ; for I remember being as much terrified by the ponderous quartos of Ihe Abbe de Sade, as I was discomfited and disappointed by the flimsy octavo of Mrs. Dobson. I am now studying Petrarch in his own works ; and it seemeth to me, in my simple wit, that such exquisite touches of truth and nature, such depth and purity of seeling, such felicity of expression, such vivid yet delicate pictures of female beauty, could spring only from a real and heartfelt passion. We know too little of Laura : but it is probable, if she had always pre served a stern and unfeeling indifference, she would not have so en tirely commanded the affections of a feeling heart ; and had she yielded she would not so long have preserved her influence. Think you if Laura had been Petrarch's wife, He would have written sonnets all his life?"], [140, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 128 In truth she appears to have been Ihe most finished coquette of her own or any other age.* 3.\u2014 What a delight it would be, if, at the end of a day like this, I had somebody with whom I could talk over things \u2014 with whose feel ings and impressions I could compare my own \u2014 who would direct my judgment, and assist me in arranging my ideas, and double every plea sure by sharing it with me ! What would have become of me if I had not thought of keeping a Diary? I should have died of a sort of men tal repletion ! What a consolation and employment has it been to me to let my overflowing heart and soul exhale themselves on paper! When I have neither power nor spirits to join in common-place con versation, I open my dear little Diary, and feel, while my pen thus swiftly glides along, much less as if I were writing than as if I were speaking \u2014 yes! speaking to one who perhaps will read this when lam no more \u2014 but not till then. I was well enough to walk up to the Rospigliosi Palace this morn ing to see Guido's Aurora : it is on Ihe ceiling of a pavilion : would it were nol ! for I looked at it till my neck ached, and my brain turned round \" like a parish top.\" I can only say that it far surpassed my expectations : the colouring is the most brilliant, yet the most harmo nious, in the world : and there is a depth, a strength, a richness in the tints, not common to Guido's style. The whole is as fresh as if painted yesterday; though Guido must have died sometime about 16,40. On each side of the hall or pavilion adorned by the Aurora, there is a small room, containing a few excellent pictures. The Triumph of David, by Domenichino, a fine rich picture; an exquisite Andromeda, by Guido, painted with his usual delicacy and sentimenl ; the twelve Apostles, by Rubens, some of them very sine ; \" the Five Senses,\" said to be by Carlo Cignani, but if so he has surpassed himself : it is like Domenichino. The Death of Samson, by L. Carracci, wrearies the eye. by the number and confusion of the figures : it has no principal group upon which the attention can rest. There is also a sine portrait of Nicolo Poussin, by himself, and an interesting head of Guido. At three o'clock we went down to the Capella Sistina to hear the Miserere. In describing the effect produced by this divine music, the time, the place, the scenic contrivance should be taken into account : the time\u2014 solemn twilight, just as the shades begin to fall around : ihe place\u2014 a noble and lofty hall where the terrors of Michel Angelo's Last Judgment are rendered more terrible by the gathering gloom, and his sublime Prophets frown dimly upon us from Ihe walls above.

Many ladies wept, and one sainted. Unassisted vocal music is certainly the finest of all : no power of instruments could have thrilled me like the blended stream of melancholy harmony, breathed forth wilh such an expression of despairing anguish, that it was almost too much to bear. Good-Friday . \u2014 I saw more new, amusing, and delightful things yesterday, than I can attempt to describe or even enumerate : but I think there is no danger of my forgetting general impressions : if my memory should fail me in particulars, my imagination can always re call the whole. In the morning I declined going to see the ceremonies at the Vatican. The procession of the host from the Sistine to the Pauline Chapel ; the washing of the Pilgrims' feet, etc. \u2014 all these things are less than in different to me ; and the illness and absence of the poor old pope ren dered them particularly uninteresting. Every body went but myself; and it was agreed that we should all meet at the door of the Sistine Chapel at sive o'clock. I remained quietly at home on my sofa till one ; and then drove to the Museum of the Valican, where I spent the rest ofthe day ; it was a grand festa, and the whole of the Vatican, includ ing the immense suite of splendid libraries, was thrown open to the public. All the foreigners in Rome having crowded to St. Peter's, or the chapels, to view the ceremonies going on, I was Ihe only stranger amidst an assemblage of the common people and peasantry, who had come to lounge there till the lightingup ofthe Cross. I walked on and on, hour after hour, lost in amazement, and wondering where and when this glorious labyrinth wastoend; successive galleries fitted up with the gay splendour of an Oriental Haram, in which the books and manuscripts are all ar ranged and numbered in cases ; the beautiful perspective of hall beyond hall vanishing away into immeasurable distance; the refulgent light shed overall ; and add to this, the extraordinary visages and costumes of the people, who with their families wandered along in groups or singly, all behaving with the utmost decorum, and making emphatic exclamations on the beauties around them. \" Ah! che bellacosa! Cosa rara! 0 bella assai .'\" all furnished me with such ample matter for amusement and observation, and admiration, that I was insensible to fatigue, and knew not that in sive hours I had scarcely completed the circuit of the Museum. One room (the Camera del Papiri) struck me particularly : it is a small octagon, the ceiling and ornaments painted by Raffaelle Mengs with exquisite taste. The group on the ceiling represents the Muse of History writing, while her book reposes on the wings of Time, and a Genius supplies her with materials : the pannelsofthis room are formed 9"], [142, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 130 of old manuscripts, pasted up against the walls and glazed. The effect of the whole is as singular as beautiful. A new gallery of marbles has lately been opened by the Pope, called from its form the Sala della Croce: in splendid, classical, and tasteful decoration, it equals any of the others, but is not, perhaps, so remarkable for the intrinsic value of ils contents. I nevermore deeply felt my own ignorance and deficiencies than I did to-day. I saw so many things I did not understand, so much which I wished to have explained to me, I longed so inexpressibly for someone to talk to, to exclaim to, to help me lo wonder, to admire, to be extasie'e I but I was alone : and I know not how it is, or why, but when lam alone, not only my powers of enjoyment seem to fail me in a degree, but even my mental faculties ; and the multitude of my own ideas and sensations confuse, oppress, and irritate me. I walked through the whole gyro of the Museum, examining the busts and pictures particularly, with the help of Este's admirable cata logue raisonnee, and at half-past sive I reached the Sistine just in time to hear the second Miserere : neither the music nor the effort were equal to the first evening. The music, though inferior to Allegri's, was truly beautiful and sublime ; but the scenic pageantry did not strike so much on repetition : the chapel was insufferably crowded, I was sick and stupid from heat and fatigue, and to crown all, just in the midst of one of the most overpowering strains, the cry of condemned souls pleading for mercy, which made my heart pause, and my flesh creep \u2014 a lady behind me whispered loudly, \" Do look what lovely broderie Mrs. L** has on her white satin spencer!\" After the Miserere, we adjourned to St. Peter's, to see the illumina tion of the Girandola. I confess the first glance disappointed me; for the cross, though more than thirty feet in height, looks trivial and di minutive, compared with the immensity of the dome in which it is sus pended ; but just as I was beginning to admire the sublime effect ofthe whole scene, I was obliged lo leave the church, being unable lo stand the fatigue any longer. To-day we have remained quietly at home, recruiting after the ex ertions of yesterday. After dinner, Colonel and Mr. W** be gan to discuss the politics of Italy, and from abusing the governments they fell upon the people; and being of very opposite principles and parties, they soon began an argument which ended in a warm dispute, and sent me to take refuge in my own room. How I detest politics and discord ! How I hale the discussion of politics in Italy ! and, above all, the discussion of Italian politics, which offer no point upon which the mind can dwell with pleasure. I have not wandered to Italy\u2014 \"this land of sun-lit skies and fountains clear,\" as Barry"], [143, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 131 Cornwall calls it, only to scrape together materials fora quarto tour, or to sweep up the leavings of the ' ' fearless\" Lady Morgan ; or to dwell upon the heart-sickening realities which meet me at every turn ; evils of which I neither understand the cause nor the cure. And yet say not to Italy \" Caduta e la tua gloria \u2014 \u00bbe tu nol' vedi !' She does see it, \u2014 she does feel it. A spirit is silently and gradually working its way beneath the surface of society, which must, erelong, break forth either for good or for evil. Between a profligate and ser vile nobility, and a degraded and enslaved populace, a middle class has lately sprung up; the men of letters, the artists, the professors in the sciences, who have obtained property, or distinction at least, in the commotions which have agitated their country, and those who have served at home or abroad in the revolutionary wars. These all seem impelled by one and the same spirit; and make up for their want of numbers by their activity, talents, enthusiasm, and the secret but in creasing influence which they exert over the other classes of society. But on subjects like these, however interesting, I have no means of obtaining information at once general and accurate : and I would rather not think, norspeak, nor write, upon \"matters which are too high for me.\" Let the modern Italians bo what they may, \u2014 what I hear them styled six times a day at least \u2014 a dirty, demoralized, degraded, un principled race, \u2014 centuries behind our thrice-blessed, prosperous, and comfort-loving nation in civilization and morals; if I were come among them as a resident, this picture might alarm me ; situated as I am, a nameless sort of person, a mere bird of passage, it concerns me not. I am not come to spy out the nakedness of the land, but to im plore from her healing airs and lucid skies the health and peace I have lost, and to worship as a pilgrim at the tomb of her departed glories. \u2014 I have not many opportunities of studying the national character ; I have no dealings with the lower classes, little intercourse with the higher. No tradesmen cheat me, no hired menials irritate me, no innkeepers fleece me, no postmasters abuse me. I love these rich delicious skies ; I love this genial sunshine, which, even in December, sends the spirits dancing through the veins; this pure elastic atmo sphere, which not only brings the distant landscape, but almost heaven itself nearer to the eye ; and all the treasures of art and nature which are poured forth around me; and over which my own mind, teeming with images, recollections, and associations, can fling a beauty even beyond their own. I willingly turn from all that excites the spleen and disgust of others ; from all that may so easily be despised, derided reviled, and abandon my heart to that state of calm benevolence towards all around me, which leaves me undisturbed, to enjoy, ad- ii \u2022"], [144, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 132 mire, observe, reflect, remember, with pleasure, if not with profit, and enables me to look upon Ihe glorious scenes with which I am sur rounded, not with the impertinent inquisition of a book-maker, nor the gloomy calculations of a politician, nor the sneering selsism ofa Smelfungus\u2014 but with the eye of the painter, and the feeling of the poet. A-propos to poets !\u2014 Lady C has just sent us tickets for Sestini's Accademia to-morrow night. So far from the race of Improvvisatori being extinct, or living only in the pages of Corinne, or in the memory ofthe Fantastici, and the Bandinelli, the Gianas, and the Corillas of other days, \u2014 thereis scarcely a small town in Italy, asl am informed, without its Improvvisatore ; and I know several individuals in the higherclasses of society, both here, and at Florence more particularly, who are remarkable for possessing this extraordinary talent \u2014 though, of course, it is only exercised for the gratification ofa private circle. Of those who make a public exhibition of their powers, Sgricci and Sestini are Ihe most celebrated \u2014 and of these Sgricci ranks first. I never heard him ; but Signior Incoronati, who knows him well, described to me his talents and powers as almost supernatural. A wonderful display of his art was the improvvisazione \u2014 we have no English word for a talent which in England is unknown, \u2014 ofa regu- lar tragedy on the Greek model, with thechorusses and dialogue com- plete. The subject proposed was from the story of Ulysses, which afforded him an opportunity of bringing in the whole sonorous nomen- clature of the Heathen Mythology, \u2014 which, saysForsyth, enlers in the web of every improvisatore, and assists the poet both with rhymes and ideas. Most of the celebrated improvvisatori have been Florentines : Sgricci is, I believe, a Neapolitan, and his rival Sestini a Roman. * * April 7. \u2014 Any public exhibition of talent in the Fine Arts is here called an Accademia. Sestini gave his Accademia in an anlicham ber of the Palazzo , I forget ils name, but it was much like all the other palaces we are accustomed to see here; exhibiling (lie same strange contrast of ancient taste and magnificence, with present meanness and poverty. We were ushered into a lofty room of noble size and beautiful proportions, with its rich fresco-painted walls and ceiling faded and falling to decay; a common brick floor, and sundry window panes broken, and stuffed with paper. The room was nearly silled by the audience, amongst whom I remarked a great number of English. A table with writing implements, and an old shattered jingling piano, occupied one side ofthe apartment, and a small space was left in front for the poet. Whilst we waited with some impatience for his appearance, several persons present walked up lo the table and wrote down various subjects ; which on Sestini's coming forward, he"], [145, "DIARY OF AN ENNUY1..E. 133 read aloud, marking those which were distinguished by the most ge neral applause. This selection formed our evening's entertainment. A lady sat down in her bonnet and shawl lo accompany him ; and when fatigued, another fair musician readily supplied her place. It is sel dom that an improvvisatore attempts to recite without Ihe assistance of music. When Dr. Moore heard Corilla at Florence, she sung to the accompaniment of two violins.* LaFanlastici preferred the guitar; and I should have preferred either to our jingling harpsichord. How ever, a few chords struck at intervals were sufficient to support the voice, and mark the lime. Several airs were tried, and considered before the poet could fix on one suited to his subject and the measure he intended to employ. In general they were pretty and simple, con sisting of very few notes, and more like a chant or recitative, than a regular air : one of the most beautiful I have obtained, and shall bring with me to England. The moment Sestini had made his choice, he stepped forward, and without further pause or preparation, began wilh the first subject upon his list, \u2014 ' 'II primo Navigatore. \", Gesner's beautiful Idyl of\" The First JVavigalor,\" supplied Sestini with the Story, in all its details ; but he versified it with surprizing fa cility : and, as far as I could judge, with great spirit and elegance. He added, too, some trifling circumstances, and several little traits, the naivete of which afforded considerable amusement. When an accurate rhyme, or apt expression, did not offer itself on the instant it was required, he knit his brows and clenched his singers with impa tience ; but I think he never hesitated more than half a second. At the moment the chord was struck, the rhyme was ready. In this manner he poured forth between thirty and forty stanzas, with still increasing animation ; and wound up his poem wilh some beautiful images of love, happiness, and innocence. Of his success I could form some idea by the applauses he received from better judges than myself. After a few minutes' repose and a glass of water, he next called on the company to supply him wilh rhymes for a sonnet. These, as fast as they were suggested by various persons, he wrote down on a slip of paper. The last rhyme given was \" Ostello,\" \u2014 (a common ale house)\u2014at which he demurred, and submitting to the company the difficulty of introducing so vulgar a word into an heroic sonnet, re spectfully begged that another might be substituted. A lady called out \" Avello,\" tbe poetical term for a grave, or a sepulchre, which expres- * Corilla (whose real name was Maddaleno Morelli) often accompanied herself on the violin; not holding it against her shoulder, but resting it in her lap. She was reckoned a fine performer on this instrument ; and for her distinguished talents was crowned in the Capitol in 1779. \u2014 [Ed.]"], [146, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 134 sion bore a happy analogy to the subject proposed. The poet smiled, well pleased; \u2014 and stepping forward wilh the paper in his hand, he immediately, without even a moment's preparation, recited a sonnet on the second subject upon his list, \u2014 '\u25a0'La Morte di Alfieri.\" \u2014 I could better judge of the merit of this effusion, because he spoke it unaccom panied by music ; and his enunciation was remarkably distinct. The subject was popular, and treated with much feeling and poetic fervour. After lamenting Alfieri as the patriot, as well as the bard, and as the glory of his country, he concluded, by indignantly repelling the sup position that \" Ihe latest sparks of genius and freedom were buried in the tomb of Vittorio Alfieri.\" A thunder of applause followed; and cries of\" 0 bravo Sestini ! bravo Sestini !\" were echoed from the Italian portion of the audience, long after the sirst acclamations had subsided. The men rose simultaneously from their seats; and I confess [ could hardly keep mine. The animation of the poet, and the enthusiasm of the audience, sent a thrill through every nerve and filled my eyes with tears. The next subject was \" La Morte di Beatrice Cenci ;\" \u2014 and this, I think, was a failure. The frightful story of Cenci is too well known in England since the publication of Shelley's Tragedy. Here it is fa miliar to all classes; and though two centuries have since elapsed, it seems as fresh in the memory, or rather in the imagination of these people, as if it had happened but yesterday. The subject was not well chosen for a public and mixed assembly; and Sestini, without advert ing to the previous details of horror, confined himself most scrupulously, with propriety, to the subject proposed. He described Beatrice led to execution, \u2014 \" con baldanza casta e generosa,\" \u2014 and Ihe effect pro duced on the multitude by her youth : \u2014 not forgetting lo celebrate \"those tresses like threads of gold whose wavy splendour dazzled all beholders,\" asthey are described bya contemporary writer. He put into her mouth a long and pious dying speech, in which she expressed her trust in Iheblessed Virgin, and her hopes of pardon from eternal justice and mercy. To my surprise, he also made her in one stanza confess and repent the murder, or rather sacrifice,* which she had perpetrated; which is contrary to the known fact, that Beatrice never confessed to the last moment of existence, nor gave any reason to suppose lhat she repented. The whole was drawn out to too great a length, and, with Ihe exception of a few happy touches, and pathetic sentiments, went off flatly. It was very little applauded. The next subject was the \" Immortality ofthe Soul,\" on which the poet displayed amazing pomp and power of words, and a wonderful Othello \u2014 Thou mak'st me call what 1 intend to do A murder, \u2014 which I thought a sacrifice. \u2014"], [147, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 135 affluence of ideas. He showed, loo, au intimate acquaintance with all that had ever been said, or sung, upon the same subject, from Plato to Thomas Aquinas. I confess I derived little benefit from all this display of poetry and erudition ; for, after the first few stanzas, finding himself irretrievably perplexed by the united difficulties of the language and the subject, I withdrew my attention, and amused myself with the paintings on the walls, and with reveries on the past and present, till I was roused by the acclamations that followed the conclusion of the poem ; which excited very general admiration and applause. The company then furnished the bouts-rime's for another sonnet : the subject was \" VAmor della Patria.\" The title, even before he began, was hailed by a round of plaudits; and the sonnet itself was excellent and spirited. Excellent I mean in its general effect, as an improvvisazione : \u2014 how it would stand the test of cool criticism I can not tell ; nor is lhat any thing to the purpose : these extemporaneous effusions ought to be judged merely as what they are, \u2014 not as finished or correct poems, but as wonderful exercises of tenacious memory, ready wit, and that quickness of imagination which can soar \u2022\" al bel cimento Sulle ali dell' momento.\" To return to Sestini. It may be imagined, that on such a subject as \" L'Amor della Patria,\" the ancient Roman worthies were not for gotten, and accordingly, a Brutus, a Scipio, a Fabius, or a Fabricius, figured in every line. And surely on no occasion could they have been more appropriately introduced : \u2014 in Rome, and when addressing Romans, who showed, by their enthusiastic applause, that though the spirit of their forefathers may be extinct, their memory is not. The next subject, which formed a sort oi pendant to the Cenci, was the \" Parricideof Tullia.'\" In this again his success was complete. The stanza in which Tullia ordered her charioteer to \" drive on,\" was given with such effect as to electrify us : and a sudden burst of ap probation which caused a momentary interruption, evidently lent the poet fresh spirits and animation. The evening concluded with a lively burlesque, entitled \" II Mer cato d'Amore,\" which represented Love as setting up a shop to sell ' ' la Mercanzia della Gioventii. \" The list of his stock in trade, though it could not boast of much originality, was given with admirable wit and vivacity. In conclusion, Love being threatened with a bankruptcy, took shelter, as the poet assured us, in the bright eyes of the ladies present. This farewell compliment was prettily turned, and intended, of course, to be general : but it happened, luckily for Sestini, that just opposite to him, and fixed upon him at the moment, were two of the brightest eyes in the world. Whether he owed any of his inspiration to"], [148, "DIAKY OF AN ENNUYEE. 136 their beams I know not; but the d-propos of the compliment was seized immediately, and loudly applauded by the gentlemen round us.\" Sestini is a young man, apparently about five-and-twenty : of a slight and delicate figure, and in his whole appearance, odd, wild, and picturesque. He has the common foreign trick of running his fingers through his black bushy hair ; and accordingly it stands on end in all directions. A pair of immense whiskers, equally black and luxuriant, meet at the point of his chin, encircling a visage of most cadaverous hue, and features which might be termed positively ugly, were it not for the \" vago spirito ardento,\" which shines out from his dark eyes, and the fire and intelligence which light up his whole countenance, till it almost kindles into beauty. Though he afterwards conversed with apparent ease, and replied to the compliments of the company, he was evidently much exhausted by his exertions. I should fear that their frequent repetition, and the effervescence of mind, and nervous excite ment they cannot but occasion, must gradually wear out his delicate frame and feeble temperament, and that the career of this extraordinary genius will be short as it is brilliant.* April 8. \u2014 As Maupertuis said after his journey to Lapland \u2014 for the universe I would not have missed the sights and scenes of yesterday ; but, for the whole universe, I would not undergo such another day of fatigue, anxiety, and feverish excitement. In the morning about ten o'clock, we all went down to St. Peter's, to hear high mass. The absence of the Pope (who is still extremely ill) detracted from the interest and dignity of the ceremony : there was no general benediction from the balcony of St. Peter's ; and nothing pleased me, except the general coup d'\u0153il ; which in truth was splen did. The theatrical dresses of the mitred priests, the countless mul titude congregated from every part of Christendom, in every variety of national costume, the immensity and magnificence of the church, and the glorious sunshine \u2014 all these enchanted the eye; but I could have fancied myself in a theatre. I saw no devotion, and I felt none. The whole appeared more like a triumphal pageant acted in honour of a heathen deity, than an act of worship and thanksgiving to the Great Father of all. I observed an immense number of pilgrims, male and female, who had come from various parts of Italy to visit the shrine of St. Peter on this grand occasion. I longed to talk to a man who stood near me, with a very singular and expressive countenance, whose cape and looped hat were entirely covered with scallop shells and reliques, and his long staff surmounted by a death's head. * Sestini died of a brain fever at Paris in November, 1822. \u2014 Ed."], [149, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 137 I was restrained by a feeling which I now think rather ridiculous : I feared, lest by conversing with him, I should diminish the effect his romantic and picturesque figure had made on my imagination. The exposition of the relics was from a balcony half way up the dome, so high and distant that I could distinguish nothing but the im pression of our Saviour's face on the handkerchief of St. Veronica, richly framed \u2014 at the sight whereof the whole multitude prostrated themselves to the earth : the other relics I forget, but they were all equally marvellous and equally credible. We returned after a long fatiguing morning lo an early dinner; and then drove again to the Piazza of St. Peter's, to see the far-famed illumination of the church. We had to wait a conside rable time ; but the scene was so novel and beautiful, that I found ample amusement in my own thoughts and observations. The twilight rapidly closed round us : the long lines of statues along the roof and balustrades, saintly defined against the evening sky, looked like spirits come down to gaze ; a prodigious crowd of carriages, and people on foot, filled every avenue : but all was still, except when a half-sup pressed murmur of impatience broke through the hushed silence of suspense and expectation. Al length, on a signal, which was given by the firing of a cannon, the whole of the immense facade and dome, even up to the cross on the summit, and the semicircular colonnades in front, burst into a blaze, as if at the touch of an enchanter's wand ; adding the pleasure of surprise to that of delight and wonder. The carriages now began to drive rapidly round the piazza, each with a train of running footmen, flinging their torches round and dashing them against the ground. The shouts and acclamations of the crowd, the stupendous building with all its architectural outlines and projec tions, defined in lines of living flame, the universal light, the sparkling of the magnificent fountains \u2014 produced an effect far beyond any thing I could have anticipated, and more like the gorgeous fictions of the Arabian Nights, than any earthy reality. After driving round the piazza, we adjourned to a balcony which had been hired for us overlooking the Tiber, and exactly opposite to the Castle of St. Angelo. Hence we commanded a view of the fireworks, which were truly superb, but made me so nervous and giddy with noise and light and wonder, that I was rejoiced when all was over. A flight of a thousand sky-rockets sent up at once, blotting the stars and the moonlight \u2014 dazzling our eyes, stunning our ears, and amazing all our senses together, concluded the Holy Week at Rome. To-morrow morning we start for Florence, and to-night I close this second volume of my Diary.

One leaves Naples as a man parts with an enchanting mistress, and Rome as we would bid adieu to an old and dear-loved friend. I love it, and grieve to leave it for its own sake ; it is painful to quit a place where we leave behind us many whom we love and regret; and almost or quite as painful, I think, to quit a place in which we leave behind us no one to regret, or think of us more ; a feeling like this mingled with the sorrow with which I bade adieu to Rome Ihis morning. Our journey has been fatiguing, triste, and tedious. * * * * LRadicofani, 10th. \u2014 I could almost regret at this moment that I am past the age of romance, for I am in a sine situation for mysterious and imaginary horrors, could I but feel again as I did at gay sixteen; but, alas! ces beaux jours sont passes ! and here lam on the top of a dreary black mountain, in a rambling old inn which looks like a ci-de vant hospital or dismantled barracks, in a bed-room which resembles one of the wards of a poor-house, one little corner lighted by my lamp, and the other three parts all lost in black ominous darkness; while a tempest rages without as if it would break in the rattling casements, and burst Ihe roof over our heads; and yet, insensible that I am! I can calmly take up my pen to amuse myself by scribbling, since sleep is impossible. I can look round my vast and solitary room without fancying a ghost oran assassin in every corner, and listen to the raving and lamenting of the storm, without imagining I hear in every gust the shrieks of wailing spirits, or the groans of murdered travellers ; only wishing that the wind were rather less cold, or my fire a little brighter, or my dormitory less infinitely spacious ; for at present its boundaries are invisible. The sirst part of our journey this morning was delightful and pic turesque; we passed the beautiful lake of Bolsena and Montepulciano, so famous for ils wine (il Rei di Vino, as Redi calls it in the Bacco in Toscdna). Later in Ihe day we entered a gloomy and desolate country ; and after crossing the rapid and muddy torrent of Rigo, which, as our Guide des Voyageurs wittily informs us, we shall have lo cross"], [151, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 139 four times if we are not drowned the third time, we began to ascend the mountainous region which divides the Tuscan from the Roman states \u2014 a succession of wild barren hills, intersected in every direction by deep ravines, and presenting a scene, sublimeindeed from its waste and wild grandeur, but destitute of all beauty, interest, magnificence and variety. I remember the strange emotion which came across me, when \u2014 on the horses stoppingto breathe on the summit of a lofty ridge, where all around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing was lo be seen but the same unvarying, miserable, heart-sinking barrenness, without a trace of human habitation, except the black fort or the highest point of Radicofani \u2014 a soft sound of bells came over my ear as if brought upon the wind. There is something in the sound of bells in the midst of a solitude which is singularly striking, and may be cheering or melancholy, according to the mood in which we may happen to be. Florence, April IA. \u2014 I have not written a word since we arrived at Sienna. What would it avail me to keep a mere journal of suffer ing? O that I could change as others do, could forget that such things have been which can never be again ! that there were not this tenacity in my heart and soul which clings to the shadow though the substance be gone 1 This is not a mere effusion of low spirits ; I was never more cheerful. I have just left a gay party, where Mr. Rogers (whom by special good fortune we meet at every resting-place, and who dined with us to-day) has been entertaining us delightfully. I disdain low spirits as a mere disease which comes over us, generally from some physical or external cause ; to prescribe for them is as easy as to disguise them is difficult : but the hopeless, cureless sadness of a heart which droops wilh regret, and throbs with resentment, is easily, very easily disguised, but not so easily banished. I hear every body round me congratulating them selves, and me more particularly, lhat we have at last reached Flo rence, that we are so far advanced on our road homewards, lhat soon we shall be at Paris, and Paris is to do wonders \u2014 Paris and Dr. R** are to set me up again, as the phrase is. But I shall never be set up again, I shall never live to reach Paris ; none can tell how I sicken at the very name of that detested place; none seem aware how fast, how very fast the principle of life is burning away within me : but why should I speak? and what earthly help can now avail me?

Florence looked most beautiful as we approached it from the south, girt wilh her theatre of verdant hills, and glittering in the sunshine. All Ihe country from Sienna to Florence is richly cultivated ; diversified with neat hamlets, farms and villas. I was more struck with the ap pearance of the Tuscan peasantry on my return from the Papal do minions lhan when we passed through the country before : no where in Tuscany have we seen that look of abject negligent poverty, those crowds of squalid beggars which shocked us in the Ecclesiastical States. In the towns where we stopped to change horses, we were presently surrounded by a crowd of people : the women came out spinning, or sewing and plaiting the Leghorn hats ; the children threw flowers into our barouche, the men grinned and gaped, but there was no vociferous begging, no disgusting display of physical evils, filth, and wretched ness. The motive was merely thai idle curiosity for which the Flo rentines in all ages have been remarked. I remember an amusing instance which occurred when I was here in December last. I was standing one evening in the Piazza del Gran Duca, looking at the group of the Rape of the Sabines : in a few minutes a dozen people gathered round me, gaping at the statue, and staring at lhat and at me alter nately, either to enjoy my admiration, or find out the cause of it : the people came out of the neighbouring shops, and the crowd continued to increase, till at length, though infinitely amused, I was glad to make my escape. I suffered from cold when first we arrived at Florence, owing lo the change of climate, or rather to mere weakness and fatigue : to-day I begin to doubt the possibility of outliving an Italian summer. The blazing almosphere which depresses the eyelids, the enervating heat, and the rich perfume of the flowers all around us, are almost too much. April 20. \u2014 During our slay at Florence, it has been one of my fa vourite occupations lo go to the Gallery or the Pitti Palace, and placing my porlable seat opposite to some favourite pictures, minutely study and compare the styles of ihe different masters. Ry the style of any particular painter, I presume we mean to express the combination of two separate essentials\u2014 first, his peculiar conception of his subject; secondly, his peculiar melhod of executing that conception, wilh re gard to colouring, drawing, and what artists call handling. The former department of style lies in the mind, and will vary according to the feelings, the temper, the personal habits, and previous education of the painter: the latter is merely mechanical, and is technically"], [153, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 141 termed the manner oi a painter; it may be cold or warm, hard, drv free, strong, tender : as we say the cold manner of Sasso Ferrato, the warm manner of Giorgione, the hard manner of Holbein, Ihe dry manner of Perugino, Ihe free manner of Rubens, the strong manner of Carravaggio, and so forth ; I heard an amateur once observe, that one of Morland's Pig-sties was painted with great feeling: all this re fers merely to mechanical execution. I am no connaisseur; and I should have lamented, as a misfortune, the want of some fixed principles of taste and criticism to guide my judgment; some nomenclature by which lo express certain effects, pe culiarities, and excellencies which I felt, rather than understood; if my own ignorance had not afforded considerable amusement to myself, and perhaps to others. I have derived some gratification from ob serving the gradual improvement of my own taste : and from compar ing the decisions of my own unassisted judgment and natural feelings, with the fiat of profound critics and connaisseurs : the result has been sometimes mortifying, sometimes pleasing. Had I visited Italy in the character of a ready-made connaisseur, I should have lost many pleasures ; for as Ihe eye becomes more practised, the taste becomes more discriminative and fastidious ; and the more extensive our acquaintance with the works of art, the more limited is our sphere of admiration ; as if the circle of enjoyment contracted round us, in pro portion as our sense of beauty became more intense and exquisite. A thousand things which once had power to charm, can charm no longer ; but, en revanche, those which do please, please a thousand times more : thus what we lose on one side, we gain on the other. Per haps, on the whole, a technical knowledge of the arts is apt to divert the mind from the general effect, lo fix it on petty details of execution. Here comes a connaisseur, who has found his way, good man ! from Somerset House, to the Tribune at Florence : see him with one hand passed across his brow, to shade the light, while the other extended forwards, describes certain indescribable circumvolutions in the air, and now he retires, now advances, now recedes again, till he has hit the exact distance from which every point of beauty is displayed to the best possible advantage, and there he stands \u2014 gazing, as never gazed the moon upon the waters, or love-sick maiden upon the moon ! We take him perhaps for another Pygmalion ? We imagine lhat it is those parted and half-breathing lips, (hose eyes lhat seem to float in light ; the pictured majesty of suffering virtue, or the tears of repenting loveliness ; the divinity of beauty, or \" the beauty of holiness,\" which have thus transfixed him ? No such thing : it is the fleshiness of the tints, the vaghezza of the colouring, the brilliance of the carnations, the fold of a robe, or the fore-shortening of a litlle finger. 0 !"], [154, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 142 whip me such connaisseurs ! the critic's stop-watch was nothing to this. Mere mechanical excellence, and all the tricks of art have their praise as long as they are subordinate and conduce to the general effect. In painting as in her sister arts it is necessary \" Che l'arte che tutto fa nulla si scuopre.\" Of course I do not speak here ofthe Dutch school, whose highest aim, and highest praise, is exquisite mechanical precision in the re presentation of common nature and still life : but of those pictures which are the productions of mind, which address themselves lo the un derstanding, the fancy, the feelings, and convey either a moral or a poetical pleasure. In taking a retrospective view of all the best collections in Italy and of the Italian school in particular, I have been struck by Ihe endless multiplication of the same subjects, crucifixions, martyrdoms, and other scripture horrors ; \u2014 virgins, saints, and holy families. The prevalence of the former class of subjects is easily explained, and has been ingeniously defended; butitis not so easily reconciled to the ima gination. The mind and the eye are shocked and fatigued by the succession of revolting and sanguinary images which pollute the walls of every palace, church, gallery, and academy, from Milan to Naples. The splendour of the execution only adds to their hideousness; we at once seek for nature, and tremble to find it. It is hateful lo see the loveliest of the arts degraded to such butcher-work. I have often gone to visit a famed collection with a secret dread of being led through a sort of intellectual shambles, and returned with the seeling of one who had supped full of horrors. I do not know how mew think, and feel, though I believe many a man, who with every other feeling absorbed in overpowering interest, could look unshrinking upon a real scene of cruelty and blood, would shrink away disgusted and sickened from the cold, obtrusive, painted representation ofthe same object; for Ihe truth of this I appeal lo men. I can only see wilh woman's eyes, and think and feel as I believe every woman must, whatever may be her love for the arts. I remember that in one of the palaces at Milan\u2014 (I think il was in the collection of the Duca Litti) \u2014 we were led up to a picture defended from the air by a plate of glass, and which being considered as the gem of the collection, was reserved for the last as a kind of bonne bouche. I gave but one glance, and turned away loathing, shuddering, sickening. The cicerone looked amazed at my bad taste, he assured me it was un vero Correggio (which by the way I can never believe), and lhat the duke had refused for it I know not how many thousand scudi. It would be difficult to say what was most execrable in this picture, Ihe appalling nature of the subject, the"], [155, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 143 depravity os mind evinced in its conception, or the horrible truth and skill with which it was delineated. I ought to add lhat it hung up in the family dining-room and in full view ofthe dinner-table. There is as picture among the chefs-d \u0153uvres in the Valican, which, if I were pope (or Pope Joan) for a single day, should be burnt by the common hangman, \" wilh the smoke of its ashes to poison the air,\" as it now poisons the sight by ils unutterable horrors. There is an other in the Palazzo Pilti, at which I shiver still, and unfortunately there is no avoiding it, as they have hung it close to Guido's lovely Cleopatra. In the gallery there isa Judith and Holofernes which irresistibly strikes the attention \u2014 if any thing would add to Ihe horror inspired by the sanguinary subject, and the atrocious fidelity and talent with which it is expressed, it is that the artist was a woman. I must confess that Judith is not one of my favourite heroines ; but I can more easily coneeive how a woman inspired by vengeance and patriotism could execute such a deed, than that she could coolly sit down, and day after day, hour after hour, touch after touch, dwell upon and almost realize to the eye such an abomination as this. We can study anatomy, if (like a certain princess) we have a taste that way, in the surgeon's dissecting-room ; we do not look upon pictures to have our minds agonized and contaminated by the sight of human turpitude and barbarity, streaming blood, quivering flesh, wounds, tortures, death, and horrors in every shape, even though it should be all very natural. Painting has been called the handmaid of nature ; is it not the duty of a handmaid to array her mistress to Ihe best possible advantage? At least to keep her infirmities from view and not to expose her loo undressed ? But I am not so weak, so cowardly, so fastidious, as lo shrink from every representation of human suffering, provided that our sympathy be not strained beyond a certain point. To p lease is the genuine aim of painting, asof all the fine arts; when pleasure is conveyed through deeply excited interest, by affecting the passions, the senses, and the imagination, painting assumes a higher character, and almost vies with tragedy : in fact, it is tragedy to the eye, and is amenable to the same laws. The St. Sebastians of Guido and Razzi ; the St. Jerome of Domenichino; the sternly beautiful Judith of Allori; the Piela of Rassaelle; the San Pietro Martire of Titian ; are all so many tragic scenes wherein whatever is revolting in circumstances or character is judiciously kept from view, where human suffering is dignified by the moral lesson it is made to convey, and ils effect on the beholder at once softened and heightened by the redeeming grace which genius and poetry have shed like a glory round it. Allowing all this, I am yet obliged to confess that I am wearied with (his class, of pictures, and that I wish there were fewer of Ihem."], [156, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 144 But there is \"one subject which never tires, at least never lires me, however varied, repealed, multiplied. A subject so lovely in itself that the most eminent painter cannot easily embellish it, or the meanest de grade it; a subject which comes home to our own bosoms and dearest feelings; and in which we may \" lose ourselves in all delightfulness,\" and indulge unreproved pleasure. I mean the Virgin and Child, or in other words, the abstract personification of what is loveliest, purest, and dearest, under heaven \u2014 maternal tenderness, virgin meekness, and childish innocence, and the beauty of holiness over all. It occurred to me to-day, that if a gallery could be formed of this subject atone, selecting one specimen from among the works of every painter, it would form not only a comparative index to their different styles, but we should find, on recurring to what is known of the lives and characters of the great masters, that each has stamped some pecu liarity of his own disposition on his Virgins; and that, after a little consideration and practice, a very fair guess might be formed ofthe character of each artist, by observing the style in which he has treated this beautiful and favourite subject. Take Raffaelle for example, whose delightful character is dwelt upon by all his biographers; his genuine nobleness of soul, which raised him far above interest, rivalship, or jealousy, the gentleness of his temper, the suavity of his manners, the sweetness of his disposition, the bene volence of his heart, which rendered him so deeply loved and admired, even by those who pined away at his success, and died of his superio rity \u2014 are all attested by contemporary writers : where but in his own harmonious character, need Raffaelle have looked for the prototypes of his half-celeslial creations? His Virgins alone combine every grace which the imagination can require \u2014 repose, simplicity, meekness, purity, tenderness; blended without any admixture of earthly passion, yet so varied, lhat though all his Virgins have a general character, distinguishing them from those of every other master, no two are exactly alike. In the Madonna del Seggiola, for instance, the prevailing expression is a serious and pensive tenderness ; her eyes are turned from her infant, but she clasps him to her bosom, as if it were not necessary to see him, to feel him in her heart. In another Holy Family in the Pilli Palace, the predominant expression is maternal rapture : in the Madonna di Foligno, it is a saintly benignity becoming the Queen of Heaven : in Ihe Madonna del Cardellino, it is a meek and chaste simplicity : it is the \" Vergine dolce ' The allusion is to La Francia. When Raffaelle sent his famous St. Cecilia to Bologna, it was intrusted to tbe care of La Francia, who was his particular friend, to be unpacked and hung up. La Francia was old, and had for many years held a high rank in his profession ; no sooner had he cast his eyes on the St Cecilia than struck with despair at seeing his highest efforts so immeasurably outdone he was seized with a deep melancholy, and ilied shortly after. \u2014 [Ed. 1"], [157, "D1AR1 OF AN ENNUYEE. 145 e pia\" os Petrarch. This last picture hangs close to the Fornarina in the Tribune, \u2014 a slrange contrast! Raffaelle's love for that haughly and voluptuous virago, had nothing to do with his conception of ideal beauty and chastity ; and could one of his own Virgins have walked out of her frame, or if her prototype could have been found on earlh, he would have felt, as others have felt \u2014 lhat lo look upon such a being wilh aught of unholy passion would be profanation indeed. Next lo Raffaelle, I would rank Correggio, as a painter of Virgins. Correggio was remarkable for the humility and gentleness of his de portment, for his pensive and somewhat anxious disposition, and kindly domestic feelings : these are the characteristics which have poured themselves forth upon his Madonnas. They are distinguished gene rally by the utmost sweetness, delicacy, grace, and devolional seeling. I remember reading somewhere that Correggio had a large family, and was a particularly fond father; and it is certain, lhat in the expression of maternal tenderness, he is superior to all but Raffaelle : his Holy Family in the Studii at Naples, and his lovely Virgin in Ihe gallery, are instances. Guido ranks next in my estimation, as a painter of Virgins. He is described as an elegant and accomplished man, remarkable for the modesty of his disposition, and the dignity and grace of his manner; as delicate in his personal habits, and sumptuous in his dress and style of living. He had unfortunately contracted a taste for gaming, which latterly plunged him into difficulties, and tinged his mind wilh bitter ness and melancholy. All his heads have a peculiar expression of ele vated beauty, which has been called Guido's air. His Madonnas arc all but heavenly : they are tender, dignified, lovely : \u2014 but when com pared with Raffaelle's, they seem more touched with earthly seeling, and have less of the pure ideal : they are, if I may so express myself, too sentimental: sentiment is, in truth, the distinguishing characteristic of Guido's style. It is remarkable, lhat towards the end of his life, Guido more frequently painted the Mater Dolorosa, and gave to the heads of his Madonnas a look of melancholy, disconsolate resignation, which is extremely affecting. Titian's character is well known : his ardent cheerful temper, his sanguine enthusiastic mind, his love of pleasure, his love of women ; and true it is, that through all his glowing pictures, we trace the voluptuary. His Virgins are rather \" des jeunes e'pouses de la veille\" \u2014 far too like his Venuses and his mistresses : they are all luxuriant human beauty ; with that peculiar air of blandishment which he has thrown into all his female heads, even into his portraits, and his old women. Witness his lovely Virgin in the Vatican, his Mater Sapienti\u00e6, and his cele brated Assumption at Venice, in which the eyes absolutely float in rapture. There is nothing ideal in Titian's conception of beauty : he 10"], [158, "DIARY OK AN ENNliYER. 146 paints no saints and goddesses fancy-bred : his females are all true, lovely women; not like the heavenly crealion of Raffaelle, looking as if a touch, a breath would profane them ; but warm flesh and blood\u2014 heart and soul\u2014 with life in their eyes, and love upon their lips : even over hisMagdalenes, his beaul y-breathing pencil has shed a something which says, A misura che ami \u2014 Piange i suoi falli ! But this is straying from my subject ; as I have embarked in this fanciful hypothesis, I shall multiply my proofs and examples, as far as I can, from memory. In some account I have read of Murillo, he is emphatically styled an honest man : this is all I can remember of his character ; and truth and nature prevail through all his pictures. In his Virgins, we can trace nothing elevated, poetical or heavenly : they have not Ihe ide ality of Raffaelle's, nor the tender sweetness of Correggio's; nor the glowing loveliness of Titian's ; but they have an individual reality about them, which gives them the air of portraits. That chef-d'ceuvre, in the Pitti Palace, for instance, call it a beautiful peasant girl and her baby, and it is faultless : but when I am told it is the \" Vergine glo riosa, del Re Eterno Madre, Figliuola, e Sposa,\" I look instantly for something far beyond what I see expressed. All Murillo's Virgins are so different from each other, lhat it is plain the artist did not paint from any preconceived idea of his own mind, but from different originals: they are all impressed wilh that general air of truth, nature, and com mon life, which stamps upon them a peculiar and distinct character. Andrea del Sarto, who is in style as in character the very reverse of Murillo, fascinated me at first by his enchanting colouring, and the magical aerial depths of his chiaro-oscuro ; but on a further acquaint ance wilh his works, I was struck by the predominance of external form and colour over mind and feeling. His Virgins look as if they had been born and bred in the first circles of society, and have a par ticular air of elegance, an artificial grace, an attraction, which may be entirely traced to exterior; to the cast of the features, the contour of the form, the disposition of the draperies, Ihe striking attitudes, and, above all, the divine colouring : beauty and dignity, and powerful ef fect, we always find in his pictures : but no moral pathos \u2014 no poetry \u2014 no sentiment \u2014 above all, a strange and total want of devotional ex pression, simplicity and humility. His Virgin with St. Francis and St. John, which hangs behind the Venus in the Tribunes, is a wonder ful picture ; and there are two charming Madonnas in the Borghese Palace at Rome. In the first we are struck by the grouping and co louring ; in the last, by a certain graceful lengthiness of the limbs, and"], [159, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 147 sine animated drawing in the attitudes. But we look in vain for the \"sacred and the sweet,\" for heart, for soul, for countenance. Andrea del Sarto had, in his profession, great talents rather lhan genius and enthusiasm. He was weak, dissipated, unprincipled; without elevation of mind or generosity of temper; and that his moral character was utterly contemptible, is proved by one trait in his life. A generous patron who had relieved him in his necessity, afterwards entrusted him with a considerable sum of money, to be laid out in certain purchases ; Andrea del Sarto perfidiously embezzled the whole, and turned it to his own use. This story is told in his life, with the addition that \" he was persuaded lo it by his wife, as profligate and ex travagant as himself.\" Carlo Dolce's gentle, delicate, and melancholy temperament, are strongly expressed in his own portrait, which is in the Gallery of Paint ings here. All his pictures are tinged by the morbid delicacy of his constitution, and the refinement of his character and habits. They have exquisite finish, but a want of power, degenerating at times into coldness and feebleness ; his Madonnas are distinguished by regular feminine beauty, melancholy, devotion, or resigned sweetness : he ex celled in Mater Dolorosa. The most beautiful of his Virgins is in Pitti Palace, of which picture there is a duplicate in the Borghese Palace at Rome. Carlo Marratti, without distinguished merit of any kind \u2014 unless it was a distinguished merit to be the father of Faustina Zappi, \u2014 owed his fortune, his title of Cavaliere, and the celebrity he once enjoyed, not to any superiority of genius, but to his successful arts as a courtier, and his assiduous flattery of the great. What can be more character istic of the man, lhan his simpering Virgins, fluttering in tasteless, many-coloured draperies, with their sky blue back-grounds, and golden clouds? Caravaggio was a gloomy misanthrope and a profligate ruffian : we read, lhat he was banished from Rome, for a murder committed in a drunken brawl ; and that he died at last of debauchery and want. Caravaggio was perfect in his gamblers, robbers, and martyrdoms, and should never have meddled with Saints and Madonnas. In his fa- mous Pietd in the Vatican, the Virgin is an old beggar-woman, the two Maries are fish-wives, in \" maudlin sorrow,\" and St. Peter and St. John, a couple of bravoes, burying a murdered traveller: dipinse ferocemente sernpre perche feroceera il suo carrattere, says his bio- grapher; an observation, by the way, in support of my hypothesis. Rubens, with all his transcendent genius, had a coarse imagination : he bore the character of an honest, liberal, but not very refined man. Rubens painted Virgins \u2014 would he had let them alone ! fat, comfort- 10*"], [160, "DURY OF AN ENNUYEE. 148 -ble farmers' wives, nursing their chubby children. Then follows Vandyke in the Opposite extreme. Vandyke was celebrated in his day, for his personal accomplishments : he was, says his biographers, a complete scholar, courtier and gentleman. His beautiful Madonnas are, accordingly, what we might expect \u2014 rather too intellectual and lady-like: they all look as if they had been polished by education. The grand austere genius of Michel Angelo was little calculated to portray the dove-like meekness of Ihe Vergine dolce e pia, or the play fulness of infantine beauty. In his Mater Amabilis, sweetness and beauty are sacrificed to expression ; and dignity is exaggerated into masculine energy. In the Mater Dolorosa, suffering is tormented into agony: the anguish is loo human : it is not sufficiently softened by resignation ; and makes us turn away wilh a too painful sympathy. Such is the admirable head in the Palazzo Litti at Milan ; such his sub lime Pietd in the Vatican \u2014 but the last, being in marble, is not quite a case in point. I will mention but two more painters of whose lives and characters I know nothing yet, and may therefore fairly make their works a test of both, and judge of them in their Madonnas, and afterwards mea sure my own penetration and the truth of my hypothesis, by a re ference to the biographical writers. In the few pictures I have seen of Carlo Cignani, I have been struck by the predominance of mind and seeling over mere external form : there is a picture of his in the Rospigliosi Palace \u2014 or rather, to give an example which is nearer at hand, and fresh in my memory, there is in the gallery here, his Madonna del Rosario. It represents a beauti ful young woman, evidently of plebeian race : the form ofthe face is round, the features have nothing of the beau-ideal, and the whole head wants dignity: yet has the painter contrived to throw into this lovely picture an inimitable expression which depends on nothing external, which in the living prototype we should term countenance; as isa chastened consciousness of her high destiny and exalted character shone through the natural rusticity of her features, and touched them wilh a certain grace and dignity, emanating from the mind alone, which only mind could give, and mind perceive. I have seen within the last few days, three copies of this picture, in all of them the charm ing simplicity and rusticity, but in none the exquisite expression of the original : even the hands are expressive, without any particular delicacy or beauty of form. An artist who was copying the picture to-day while I looked at it, remarked this ; and confessedhe had made several unsuccessful altempts to render the fond pressure of the finders as she clasps the child to her bosom. Were I to judge of Carlo Cignani by his works, I should pronounce"], [161, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 149 him a man of elevated character, noble by instinct, if not by descent, but simple in. his habits, and a despiser of outward show and ostentation. The other painter I alluded to, is Sasso Ferrato, a great and admired manufacturer of Virgins, but a mere copyist, without pathos, power, or originality; sometimes he resembles Guido, sometimes Carlo Dolce; but the graceful harmonious delicacy of the former becomes coldness and flatness in his hands, and the refinement and sweetness of the latter sink into feebleness and insipidity. Were I to judge of his character by his Madonnas, I should suppose that Sasso Ferrato had neither original genius nor powerful intellect, nor warmth of heart, nor vivacity of temper ; that he was, in short, a mere mild, inoffensive, good sort osman, studious and industrious in his art, not without a seeling for the excellence he wanted power to attain.* I might pursue this subject further, but my memory fails, my head aches, and my pen is tired for to-night. \u25a0at * * A. Tt Both here and at Rome, I have found considerable amusement in looking over the artists who are usually employed in copying or stu dying from the celebrated pictures in the different galleries ; but I have been taught discretion on such occasions by a ridiculous incident which occurred the other day, as absurdly comic as it was unlucky and vex atious. A friend of mine observing an artist at work in the Pitti palace, whom, by his total silence and inattention to all around, she supposed to be a native Italian who did not understand a word of English, went up to him, and peeping over his shoulder, exclaimed with more truth than discretion, \" Ah ! what a hideous attempt ! that will never be like, I'm sure I\" \"I am very sorry you think so, ma'am,\" replied the painter, coolly looking up in her face. He must have read in that beautiful face an expression which deeply avenged the cause of his affronted picture. We have been twice to the opera since we arrived here. At the Pergola, Bassi, though a woman, is the Primo Uomo ; the rare qua lity of her voice, which is a kind of rich deep counter-tenor, unfitting her for female parts. Her voice and science are so admirable, that it would be delicious to hear her blindfold ; but her large clumsy figure disguised, or rather exposed, in masculine attire, is quite revolting. At the Cocomero we had the \" Italiana in Algieri :\" the Prima Donna, who is an admired singer, gave the comic airs with great power and effect, but her bold execution and her ungraceful unliquid voice disgusted me, and I came away fatigued and dissatisfied. The danc ing is execrable at both theatres. * Forsyth complains of some celebrated Madonnas being unimpassioned : with submission to Forsyth's taste and acumen \u2014 ought they to be impassioned?"], [162, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 150 From one end of Italy to the other, nothing is listened to in the way of music but Rossini and his imitators. The man must have a trans cendant genius, who can lead and pervert the taste of his age as Ros sini has done ; but unfortunately those who have not his talent, who cannot reach his beauties nor emulate his airy brilliance of imagination, think to imitate his ornamented style by merely crowding note upon note, semi-quavers, demi-semi-quavers, and semi-demi-semi-quavers in most perplexed succession ; and thus all Italy, and thence all Europe, is deluged with this busy, fussy, hurry-skurry music, which means nothing, and leaves no trace behind it either on the fancy or the me mory. Must it be ever thus? are Paesiello, and Pergolesi, and Cima rosa \u2014 and those divine German masters, who formed themselves on the Italian school and surpassed it \u2014 Winter and Mozart* and Gluck \u2014 are they eternally banished ? must sense and feeling be for ever sacrificed to mere sound, the human organ degraded into a mere instrument, f and the ear tickled with novelty and meretricious ornament, till the taste is utterly diseased? There was a period in the history of Italian literature, when the great classical writers were decried and neglected, and the genius of one man depraved the taste of the age in which he lived. Marini in troduced, oral least rendered general and fashionable, lhat far-fetched wit, that tinsel and glittering style, lhat luxurious pomp of words, which was easily imitated by talents of a lower order : yet in the Adonis there are many redeeming passages, some touches of real palhos, and some stanzas of natural and beautiful description : and Ihus it is with Rossini ; his best operas contain some melodies among the tinest ever composed, and even in his worst, Ihe ear is every now and then roused and enchanted by a few bars of graceful and beautiful melody, to be in the next moment again bewildered in the maze of unmeaning notes, and the clash of overpowering accompaniments. Lucca, April 23. \u2014 Lucca disappoints me in every respect : it was once, when a republic, one of the most flourishing, rich, and populous cities in Italy ; it is now consigned over to the Ex-queen of Etruria ; and its fate will be perhaps the same as thatof Venice, Pisa, and Sienna, which, when they lost their independence, lost also their public spirit, Iheir public virtue, and their prosperity. It is impossible to conceive any thing more rich and beautiful, than * Dr. Holland once told me, that when travelling in Iceland, he had heard one of Mozart's melodies played and sung by an Icelandic girl, and that some months alterwards he heard the very same air sung to the guitar by a Greek lady at Salo nica.

The road lay through valleys, with the Apennines (which are here softened down into gently sunny hills) on each side. Every spot of ground is in the highest state of cultivation ; the boundaries between the small fields of wheat or lupines, were rows of olives or mulberries, with an interminable treillage of vines flung from tree to tree. In England we should be obliged to cut them all down for fear of depriving the crops of heat and sunshine, but here they have no such fears. The style of husbandry is exquisitely neat, and in general performed by manual labour. The only plough I saw would have excited the amusement and amazement of an English farmer: I should think it was exactly similar to the ploughs of Virgil's time : it was drawn by an ox and an ass yoked together, and guided by a woman. The whole country looked as if it had been laid out by skilful gardeners, and the hills in many parts were cut into terraces, lhat not one available inch of soil might be lost. The products of this luxuriant country are corn, silk, wine, and principally oil : potteries abound, the making of jars and flasks being an immense and necessary branch of trade. The city of Lucca has an appearance in itself of stately solemn dul ness, and bears no trace of the smiling prosperity of the adjacent coun try : the shops are poor and empty, there are no signs of business, and the streets swarm with beggars. The interior of the Duomo is a fine specimen of Gothic : the exterior is Greek, Gothic, and Saracenic jumbled together in vile taste : it contains nothing very interesting. The palace is like other palaces, very fine and so forth ; and only re markable for not containing one good picture, or one valuable work of art. Pisa, April 55. \u2014 Pisa has a look of elegant tranquillity, which is not exactly dulness, and pleases me particularly : if the thought of its past independence, the memory of its once proud name in arts, arms, and literature, came across the mind, it is not accompanied by any painful regret caused by the sight of present misery and degradation, but by lhat philosophic melancholy with which we are used to con template the mutability of earthly greatness. The Duomo, the Baptistry, the Leaning Tower, and the Campo Santo, stand altogether in a fine open elevated part of the city. The Duomo is a magnificent edifice in bad taste. The interior, with ils noble columns of oriental granite, is grand, sombre, and very striking. As to the style of architecture, it would be difficult to determine what name to give it : it is not Greek, nor Gothic, nor Saxon, and exhibits a strange mixture of Pagan and Christian ornaments, not very unfrequent in Italian churches. The Leaning Tower should be contemplated from the portico of the church to heighten its effect : when the per-"], [164, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 152 pendicular column cuts it to the eye like a plumb line, the obliquity appears really terrific. The Campo Santo is an extraordinary place : in affects the mind like the cloisters of one of our Gothic cathedrals which it resembles in effect. Means have lately been taken to preserve the singular frescos on the walls, which for five hundred years have been exposed to the open air. I remarked the tomb of that elegant fabulist Pignotli; the last personage of celebrity buried in the Campo Santo. The university of Pisa is no longer what it was when France and Venice had nearly gone to war about one of its law professors, and its colleges ranked next to those of Padua : it has declined in fame, in riches, and in discipline. The Botanic Garden was a few years ago the finest in all Europe, and is still maintained with great cost and care : it contains a lofty magnolia, the stem of which is as bulky as a good sized tree : the gardener told us rather poetically, that when in blossom it perfumed Ihe whole cily of Pisa. Leghorn, April ?6. \u2014 So different from any thing we have yet seen in Ilaly ! busy streets \u2014 gay shops \u2014 various costumes \u2014 Greeks, Turks, Jews, and Christians, mingled on terms of friendly equality \u2014 a crowded port, and all the activity of prosperous commerce. Leghorn is in every sense a free port : all kinds of merchandise enler exempt from duty, all religions are equally tolerated, and all nations trade on an equal sooting. The Jews, who are in every other city a shunned and degraded race, are among the most opulent and respectable inhabitants of Leghorn : their quarter is the richest, and, I may add, the dirtiest in the city : their synagogue here is reckoned the finest in Europe, and 1 was induced to visit it yesterday at the hour of worship. I confess I was much disappointed ; and, notwithstanding my inclination lo respect always what is respectable in the eyes of others, I never felt so strong a disposition to smile. An old Rabbi with a beard of venerable length, a pointed bonnet, and a long white veil, got up into a superb marble pulpit and chanted in strange nasal tones, something which was repeated after him in various and discordant voices by the rest of the assembly. The congregation consisted of an uncouth set of men and boys, many of them from different parts of the Levant, in the dresses of their respective countries : there was no appearance of de votion, no solemnity; all wore their hats, some were poring over ragged books, some were talking, some sleeping, or lounging, or smoking. While I stood looking about me, without exciting the smallest atten tion, I heard al every pause a prodigious chattering and whispering, which seemed to come from the regions above, and looking up I saw a row of latticed and skreened galleries where the women were caged"], [165, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE 153 up like the monkies at a menagerie, and seemed as noisy, as restless, and as impatient of confinement : the door-keeper offered lo intro duce me among them, but I was already tired and glad to depart. We have visited the pretty English burial-ground, and the tomb of Smollet, which in the true English style is cut and scratched all over wilh the names of fools, who think thus to link their own insignificance to his immortality. We have also seen whatever else is to be seen, and what all travellers describe : to-morrow we leave Leghorn \u2014 for myself without regret : it is a place with which I have no sympathies, and the hot, languid, damp atmosphere, which depresses the spirits and relaxes the nerves, has made me suffer ever since we arrived. Lucca. \u2014 Had I never visited Italy I think I should never have un derstood the word picturesque. In England we apply it generally to rural objects or natural scenery, for nothing else in England can deserve the epithet. Civilization, cleanliness, and comfort are excellent things, bul they are sworn enemies to the picturesque : they have banished it gradually from our towns, and habitations, into remote countries, and little nooks and corners, where we are obliged to hunt after it lo sind it; but in Italy the picturesque is every where, in every variety of form ; it meets us at every turn, in town and in country, at all times and seasons ; the commonest objects of every-day life here become picturesque, and assume from a thousand causes a certain character of poetical interest it cannot have elsewhere. In England, when travel ling in some distant county, we see perhaps a craggy hill, a thatched cottage, a mill on a winding stream, a rosy milkmaid, or a smock frocked labourer whistling after his plough, and we exclaim \"How picturesque!\" Travelling in Italy we see a piny mountain, a little dilapidated village on its declivity, Ihe ruined temple of Jupiter or Apollo on its summit ; a peasant with a bunch of roses hanging from his hat. and singing to his guitar, or a cotadina in her white veil and scarlet petticoat, and we exclaim \"How picturesque !\" but how dif ferent !

A spinning wheel is very convenient it must be allowed, but the distaff and spindle are much more picturesque.

A laundry-maid at her wash-tub, immersed in soap-suds, is a vulgar idea, though our"], [166, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 154 clothes may be the better for it. I shall never forget Ihe group of women I saw at Terracina washing their linen in a bubbling brook as clear as crystal, which rushed from the mountains to the sea\u2014 there were twenty of them at least grouped with Ihe most graceful effect, some standing up to the mid-leg in the stream, others spreading the linen on Ihe sunny bank, some, flinging back their long hair, stood shading their brows with their hands and gazing on us as we passed : it was a scene for a poet, or a painter, or a melo-drama. An English garden, adorned at every turn with statues of the heathen deities (al though they were all but personifications of the various attributes ol nature,) would be ridiculous. Selling aside the injury Ihey must sus tain from our damp, variable climate, they would be out of keeping with all around ; here it is alogether different ; the very air of Italy is embued with the spirit of ancient mythology ; and though \" the fair humanities of old religion,\" the Nymphs, the Fauns, the Dryads be banished from their haunts and live no longer in the faith of reason, yet still, whithersoever we turn, some statue, some temple in ruins, some fragment of an altar, some inscription half effaced, some name half-barbarized, recalls lo the fancy those forms of light, of beauty, of majesty, which poetry created lo people scenes for which mere hu manity was not in itself half pure enough, fair enough, bright enough. What can be more grand than a noble sorest of English oak? or more beautiful than a grove of beeches and elms, clothed in their rich autumnal tints ? or more delicious than the apple orchard in full bloom? but it is true, notwithstanding, that the olive, and cypress, and cedar, the orange and the citron, the fig and the pomegranate, the myr tle and the vine, convey a different and more luxuriant seeling to the mind ; and are associated with ideas which give lo the landscape they adorn a character more delightfully, more poetically picturesque. When at Lord Grosvenor's or Lord Stafford's I have been seated opposite to some beautiful Italian landscape, a Claude or a Poussin, with a hill crowned with olives, a ruined temple, a group of peasants seated on a fallen column, or dancing to the pipe and the guitar, and over all the crimson glow of evening, or the violet tints of morning, I have ex claimed with others, \" How lovely ! how picturesque, how very poelical !\" No one thought of saying \" How natural \\\" because it isa style of nature with which we are totally unacquainted; and if some amateurs of real taste and seeling prefer a rural catlle scene of Paul Potter or Cuyp, lo all Ihe grand or lovely creations of Salvator, or Claude, or Poussin, it is perhaps, because the former are associated in their minds with reality and familiar nature, while the latter appear in comparison mere inventions of the painter's fertile fancy, mere vision ary representations of what may or might exist, but which do not come home to the memory or the mind with Ihe force of truth or delighted"], [167, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 155 recollection. So when I have been travelling in Italy how often I have exclaimed, \" How like a picture 1\" and I remember once, while con templating a most glorious sunset from the banks of the Arno, I caught myself saying, \" This is truly one of Claude's sunsets !\" Now should I live to see again one of my favourite Grosvenor Claudes 1 shall pro bably exclaim, '\" How natural I how like what I have seen so often on the Arno, or from the Monte Pincio !\" And, in conclusion, let it be remembered by those who are inclined to smile (as I have often done) when travellers fresh from Italy rave almost in blank verse, and think it all as unmeaning as \" Lutes, laurels, seas of milk, and ships of amber!\" let them recollect lhat it is not alone the visible picturesque of Italy which thus intoxicates ; it is not only her fervid skies, her sunsets, which envelope one-half of heaven from the horizon to the zenith, in living blaze ; nor her soaring pine-clad mountains ; nor her azure seas: nor her fields, \" ploughed by the sunbeams ; nor her gorgeous cities, spread out wilh all their domes and towers, unobscured by cloud or vapours; \u2014 but it is something more than these, something beyond, and over all \u2014 The gleam, The light that never was on sea or land The consecration, and the poet's dream ! Genoa, 30. \u2014 We arrived here late, and I should not write now, weary, weak, sick, and down-spirited as I am, did I not know how the impressions of one day efface those of the former ; and as I cannot sleep, it is belter to scribble than to think. As to describing all I have seen, thought, and felt in three days, lhat were indeed impossible : I think I have exhausted all my prose eloquence, and all allowable raptures ; so thai unless I ramble into ab solute poetry, I dare not say a word of the scenery around Sarzana and Lerici. After spending one evening at Sarzana, in lingering through green lanes and watching the millions of fire-flies, sparkling in the dark shade of the trees, and lost again in the brilliant moonlight \u2014 we left it the next morning about sunrise, to embark in a felucca at Lerici, as the road between Spezia and Sestri is not yet completed. The groves and vineyards on each side of the road were filled wilh nightingales, singing in concert loud enough to overpower the sound of our carriage wheels, and the whole scene, as the sun rose over it, and the purple shadows drew off and disclosed it gradually to the eye, was so enchant ing \u2014 that positively I will say nothing about it. Lerici is a small fishing lown on the Gulf of Spezia. Here I met with an adventure which with a little exaggeration and embellishment,"], [168, "156 DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. such as no real story-teller ever spares, would make an admirable morceau fora quarto tourist ; but, in simple truth, was briefly thus._ While some of our party were at breakfast, and the servants and sailors were embarking the carriages and baggage, I sat down to sketch the old grey fort on the cliff above the town ; but every time I looked up, the scene was so inexpressibly gay and lovely, it was with diffi culty and reluctance I could turn my eyes down to my paper again; and soon I gave up the attempt, and threw away both paper and pencil. It struck me that the view from the castle itself must be a thousand limes finer than the view of the castle from below, and without loss of lime I proceeded to explore the path leading to it. With some fatigue and difficulty, and after losing myself once or twice, I reached the top of the rock, and there a wicket opened into a walled passage cut inlo steps to ease the ascent. I knocked at the wicket with three strokes, that being the orthodox style of demanding entrance into the court of an enchanted castle, using my parasol instead of a dagger,* and no one appearing, I entered, and in a few moments reached a small paved terrace in front of the fortress, defended towards the sea by a low parapet wall. The massy portal was closed, and instead of a bugle horn hanging at the gate I found only the handleand fragments of an old birch-broom, which base utensil I presently ap plied to the purpose of a horn, viz. sounding an alarm, and knocked and knocked \u2014 bul no hoary-headed seneschal nor armed warder appeared at my summons. After a moment's hesitation, I gave Ihe door a push with all my strength : it yielded, creaking on its hinges, and I stepped over the raised threshold. I found myself in a low dark vaulted hall which appeared at first to have no communication wilh any olher chamber : but on advancing cautiously to the end I found a low door in Ihe side, which had once been defended by a strong iron grating of which some part remained : it led to a flight of stone stairs, which I began lo ascend slowly, slopping every moment lo listen ; but all was still as the grave. On each side of this winding staircase I peeped inlo several chambers, all soliiary and ruinous : more and more surprised, I continued lo ascend till I put my head unexpectedly through a trap door, and found myself on the roof on the lower : it was spacious, defended by battlements, aud contained the only signs of warlike prepa ration I had met with; videlicet, two cannons, or culverins, as they are called, and a pyramidal heap of balls, rusted by the sea air. I sat down on one of the cannon, and leaning on the battlemenls, surveyed the scene around, below me, wilh a feeling of rapture, not a little enhanced by the novelty and romance of my situation. I was alone\u2014 I had no reason to think there was a single human being \" With dagger's hilt upon the gate, Who knocks so loud and knocks so late ?\" \u2014 Scott."], [169, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 157 within hearing. I was at such a vast height above the town and the shore, that not a sound reached me, except an indistinct murmur now and then, borne upwards by the breeze, and the scream of the sea-fowl as they wheeled round and round my head. I looked down giddily upon the blue sea, all glowing and trembling in the sunshine : and the scenery around me was such, as the dullest eye \u2014 -the coldest, Ihe most unimaginative soul, could not have contemplated without emotion. I sat,I know not how long, abandoned to reveries, sweet and bitter, till I was startled by footsteps close to me, and turning round, I beheld a figure so strange and fantastic, and considering the time, place, and circumstance, so incomprehensible and extraordinary, lhat I was dumb with surprise. It was a little spare old man, wilh a face and form which resembled the anatomy ofa baboon, dressed in an ample night gown of flowered silk, which hung upon him as if it had been made for a giant, and trailed on the ground, a yard and a half behind him. He had no stockings, but on his feet a pair of red slippers, turned up in front like those the Turks wear. His beard was grizzled, and on his head he wore one ofthe long many-coloured woollen caps usually worn in this country, wilh two lassels depending from it, which nearly reached his knees. I had full time to examine the appearance and costume of this strange apparition as he stood before me, bowing pro foundly, and looking as if fright and wonder had deprived him of speech. As soon as I had recovered from my first amazement, I re plied lo every low bow, by as low a courtesy, and waited till it should please him to begin the parley. At length he ventured to ask, in bad provincial Italian, what I did there? I replied that I was only admiring the fine prospect. He begged to know, \" come diavolo,\" I had got there ? I assured him I had not got thereby any diabolical aid, but had merely walked through the door. Santi Apostoli J did not my excellency know, that, according to the laws and regulations of war, no one could enter the fort, without permission first obtained of the governor ? I apologized politely : ' 'And where, \" said I, \"is the governor ? ' ' II Governatore son io per servirla ! he replied, wilh a low bow. You ! 0 che bel ceffo / thought I \u2014 \" and what, Signor Governor, is the use of your fort ? \" \"To defend the bay and town of Lerici from enemies and pirates.\" \"But,\" said I, \"I see no soldier; where is the garrison to defend the fort?\" \" The little old man stepped back two steps \u2014 \" Eccomi!\" he re plied, spreading his hand on his breast, and bowing with dignity. It was impossible to make any reply : I therefore wished the go vernor and garrison good morning ; and disappearing through my"], [170, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 158 trap-door, I soon made my way down to the shore, where I arrived out of breath, and just in lime to step into our felucca. If there be a time when we most wish for those of whom we always think, when we most love those who are always dearest, it must be on such a delicious night as that we passed at Sarzana, or on such a morning as that we spent at Lerici ; and if there be a time when we least love those we always love\u2014 least wish for them, least think of them, it must be in such a moment as the noontide of yesterday\u2014 when the dead calm overtook us, half way between Lerici and Sestri, and I sat in the stern of our felucca, looking with a sort of despairing languor over the smooth purple sea, which scarcely heaved round us, while the flapping sails drooped useless round the masts, and Ihe rowers indolently leaning on their oars, sung in a low and plaintive chorus. I sat hour after hour, still and silent, sickening in the sun shine, dazzled by ils reflection on the water, and overcome wilh deadly nausea : I believe nothing on earth could have roused me at lhat mo ment. But evening so impatiently invoked, came at last : the sun set, Ihe last gleam of his \" golden path of rays\" faded from the waters, the sea assumed the hue of ink ; the breeze sprung up, aud our little vessel, wilh all its white sails spread, glanced like a wild swan over the waves, leaving behind \"a moon-illumined wake.\" Two hours after dark we reached Sestri, where we found miserable accom modations; and after foraging in vain for something to eat, after our day's fast, we crept to bed, all sick, sleepy, hungry, and tired. * * * * * We leave Genoa to-morrow : I can say but little of it, for I have been ill, as usual, almost ever since we arrived ; and though my little Diary has become to me a species of hobby, I have lately found it fatiguing, even to write ! and the pleasure and interest it used to afford me, diminish daily. Genoa, though fallen, is still \"Genoa the proud.\" She is like a noble matron, blooming in years, and dignified in decay; while her rival Venice always used to remind me ofa beautiful courtezan repent ing in sackcloth and ashes, and mingling the ragged remnants of her former splendour wilh the emblems of present misery, degradation, and mourning. Pursue the train of similitude, Florence may be likened to a blooming bride dressed out to meet her lover ; Naples lo lasso's Armida, with all the allurements of the Syren, and all the terrors of the Sorceress ; Rome sits crowned upon the grave of her power, widowed indeed, and desolate, but still, like the queenly Con slance, she maintains Ihe majesty of Sorrow \u2014 \" This is my throne, let kings come bow to it!\""], [171, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 159 The coup-d'\u0153il of Genoa, splendid as it is, is not equal to lhat of Naples, even setting poetical associations aside : it is built like a crescent round the harbour, rising abruptly from the margin of the water, which makes the view from Ihe sea so beautiful : to Ihe north the hills enclose it round like an amphitheatre. The adjacent country is covered with villas, gardens, vineyards, woods, and olive-groves forming a scene most enchanting to the eye and mind, though of a character very different from the savage luxuriance of ihe south of Italy, The view of the city from any of the heighls around, more parti cularly from lhat part of the shore called the Ponente, where we were to-day, is grand beyond description ; on every side the church of Carignano is a beautiful and striking object. There is but one street, properly so called, in Genoa \u2014 the Strada Nuova ; the others are little paved alleys, most of them impassable to carriages, both from their narrowness and the irregularity of the ground on which the city is built. The Strada Nuova is formed of a double line of magnificent palaces, among which the Doria Palace is conspicuous. The architecture is in general fine ; and when not good is at least pleasing : the fronts of the houses are in genera! gaily painted and stuccoed. The best apart ments are usually al the top ; and the roofs often laid out in terraces, or paved with marble and adorned with flowers and shrubs. I have seen few good pictures here : the best collections are those in the Brignolet and Durazzo palaces. In the latter are some striking pictures by Spagnoletto (or Ribera, as he is called here). In the Brignolet, the Roman Daughter, by Guido, struck me most. I was also pleased by some fine pictures of the Genoese painter Piola, who is little known beyond Genoa. The church of the Carignano, which is a miniature model of St. Peter's, contains Pagel's admirable statue of St. Sebastian, which Napoleon intended to have conveyed to Paris. Beauty is no rarity at Genoa: I think I never saw so many fine women in one place, though I have seen finer faces at Rome and Naples than any I see here. The mezzaro, a veil or shawl thrown over the head and round the shoulders, is universal, and is certainly the most natural and becoming dress which can be worn by our sex: the materials differ in fineness, from the most exquisite lace and the most expensive embroidery, to a piece of chintz or linen, but the effect is the same. This costume, which prevails more or less through all Italy, but here is general, gives somethingos beauty lo the plainest face, and somethingos elegance to the most vulgar figure ; it can make de-"], [172, "DIARY OF AN ENNUYEE. 160 sormity itself look passable : and when worn by a really graceful and beautiful female, the effect is peculiarly picturesque and bewitching. It was a Fesla to-day; and we drove slowly along the Ponenle after dinner. Nothing could be more gay than the streets and public walks, crowded with holiday people : the women were in proportion as six to one; and looked like groups dressed to figure in a melodrame or ballet. When once we have left Genoa behind us, and have taken our last look ofthe blue Mediterranean, I shall indeed feel lhat we have quilled Italy. Piedmont is not Italy. Cities which are only famous for their sieges and fortifications, plains only celebrated as fields of battle and scenes of blood, have neither charms nor interest for me. On Monday we set off for Turin : how I dread travelling ! and the motion of the carriage, which has now become so painful ! Yet a little, a very little longer, and it will all be over.

Turin, May 10./.. \u2014 We arrived here yesterday, after a journey to me most trying and painful : I thought at Novi and afterwards at Asl.i, that I should have been obliged to give up and confess my inability to proceed ; but we know not what we can bear till we prove ourselves ; I can live and suffer still-. I agree with who has just left me, lhat nothing can be more animatingand improving than the conversation of intelligent and clever men, and that lady-society is in general very/<_<_e and tiresome : and yet I truly believe that no woman can devote herself exclusively to the society of men without losing some of the best and sweetest character istics of her sex. The conversation of men of the world and men of gallantry, gives insensibly a taint to the miud; the unceasing language of adulation and admiration intoxicates the head and perverts the heart ; the habit of tete-d-tetes , the habit of being always either the sole or the principal object of attention, of mingling in no conversation which is not personal, narrows the disposition, weakens the mind, and renders it incapable of rising to general views or principles ; while it so excites the senses and the imagination, that every thing else becomes in compa rison stale, flat, and unprofitable. The life of a coquette is very like lhat of a drunkard or an opium eater, and its end is the same \u2014 the utter extinction of intellect, of cheerfulness, of generous feeling, and of self-respect.

But I cannot think as I used to think : my ideas are per plexed : it is all pain of heart and confusion of mind ; a sense of bitterness, and wrong, and sorrow, which I cannot express, nor yet quite suppress. If the cloud would but clear away that I might feel and see to do what is right! but all is dark, and heavy, and vacant ; my mind is dull, and my eyes are dim, and I am scarce conscious of any thing around me.

I should regret what I have left behind, had I not outlived all regrets\u2014 but one \u2014 for there, though I vainly sought from outward forms to win The passion and the life whose fountains are within ; all feeling was not yet worn out of my heart : I was not then blinded nor stupified by sorrow and weakness as 1 have been since. There are some places we remember with pleasure, because we have been happy there ; others, because endeared to us as the residence of friends. We love our country because it is our country ; our home because it is home: London or Paris we may prefer, as comprehending in themselves, all the intellectual pleasures, and luxuries of life: but, dear Italy ! \u2014 we love it, simply for its own sake : not as in general we are attached to places and things, but as we love a friend, and the face of a friend; there it was \"luxury to be,\" \u2014 there I would willingly have died, if so it might have pleased God.

Here I am not ashamed of living in comfort, or travelling for my en joyment. The lofty pyramid of society, whose regular gradation is so perceptible, from the wide basis to the tapering apex, seems as if in England it held togelher the firmer for its polished corner-stones; and it is, at all events, a relief to one's selfishness to look upon snug cottages, and a healthy, happy peasantry, instead of that degradation of human nature which met my eye at every turn in the neigh bourhood of Delaval Caslle.

Married al seventeen to the man of my choice, all seemed to smile upon me when I followed Colonel Delaval to Ireland ; nor could I forgive my sister Armine, for whispering, on the eve of our union, that an acquaintance of six weeks scarcely justified me in placing my happiness within his keeping.

Instead of quarrelling with society (the common error of misanthropes, who, like myself, desire only a life of tranquil lity), I shall, in my worst of humours, doff the world aside, and bid it pass ; in my best, smile in its face, and thank it for its smiles ; \u2014 then retire like an oyster into my shell, as easily forgetting as for gotten 1 It is true, Armine and I entertain for each other a more than com mon sisterly affection. The early loss of our parents, the secluded life we led in Staffordshire, under the care of our good aunt Margaret, now gathered to the vault of all the Montresors, rendered us in youth mutually dependent on each other's friendship. But the experiences of our married life seem to have created estrangements; and we are no longer silted to understand each other as formerly. I once saw in a pavilion, near the Lake of Windermere, four contiguous windows of variously stained glass, imparting to the same landscape the aspect of the four seasons. Just so it is with us.

Better, how ever, trust to her experience, than venture alone into the wide world of London, which I know so little, yet dislike so much. How de testable were those biennial visits to town with my aunt Margaret Montresor, who, every year or two, used to migrate from Staffordshire to a ready-furnished house, where the windows would not open, nor the doors close, to persecute her solicitors with a new plea for her old Chancery suit, and Armine and myself with visits lo the dentist, stay maker, shoemaker, the wax-work, and the Eidouranion, \u2014 Halchard's and Rivington's, \u2014 to torment our souls and bodies into the way they should go !

Poor little bride ! it must have cost her many a pang to quit the shrine where she had been worshipped. There are a thousand traces of womanliness in the house, such as were never im pressed by the hand of an upholsterer ; particularly in my own room and boudoir, Ihe walls of which are hung wilh light chintz and muslin draperies, with windows opening through a conservatory lo the park.

She is enchanted that Armine and her husband will not be in town for some months; and declares that the Herberts are just the sort of humdrum people to spoil me, \u2014 to \" set me in a wrong pattern.\" After all, her notions are rather arbitrary. I used to fancy Lady Cecilia the most independent and easy person in the world ; but her ease turns out to be a laborious affair, \u2014 a perpetual warfare with the ceremonial of life. There is such a thing, I suspect, as being the slave of one's liberty. I believe, however, I cannot put myself under safer tutelage than her's. No one is so much Ihe fashion. She commands the interest and influence of her sister, the Marchioness of Clackmannan (a lady of the bed-chamber, and patroness of Almack's, and all lhat sort of thing), without the bore and trouble of place-holding; while her stupid husband, Sir Jenison Delaval, s'empresse de dire amen d toutes ses ?nesses, fancying her, or at least proclaiming her, the best of wives, because she is wise enough to let him pass his life at his \u25a0 \u00bb"], [180, "DIARY OF A D..SENNUYEE. 4 cluh, well-bred enough to be civil to him in public, and judicious enough never to see him in private. Lady C. is, in short, a woman of what is called the world. She has prodigious tact ; always some little scheme or other on foot, and which invariably succeeds. But, after all, the objects she accomplishes are comparatively trifling ; and, to spend one's life in such man\u0153uvres, seems like devoting a forty horse-power engine to cutting chaff. Nothing, for instance, can exceed her delight at having outwitted Lady Wexford, a tortoise of a dowager (whom I used to know in Dublin), in the choice ofa certain opera-box, which we are to share together. It strikes me that any other would have suited us as well. But Lady Cecilia tells me General Vernon has had a ticket of lhat identical box for the last thirty years, and will not be at the trouble of changing it ; so that she is sure of getting rid of her spare ticket. It is plain that she does not choose to have a place at the disposal of Sir Jenison. The box holds only four ; and she advises me to retain both mine. I amused her not a little by inquiring whether General Vernon was a pleasant man, as she seemed so glad to secure him ; and she amused me no less by replying, that he was a bore par excellence, but too well taught to dream of setting foot in the box to which he be longs. 10./.. \u2014 Just relumed from a long drive with Lady Cecilia. What multidudes of people ! Yet they sayjhere will be no one in town till after Easter ; and nothing going on till the end of May. The \" nothing,\" so called, consists, however, in nightly parties, twice as numerous and brilliant as any I have been in the habit of enjoying; and last night I accompanied Lady Cecilia to a card-party, compre hending, she assured me, the elite ofthe elite. One of the Sicilian mummy-vaults, described by travellers, must certainly present just such a conclave of lean, yellow, shrivelled, inexpressive faces. In the course of the evening, a few male individuals, half a century younger than the enshrined divinities of the temple, made their appearance; but of these the small-talk was so very small, and the big looks so very big, that I took refuge in ray own observations. \" You will like them belter when their jargon ceases to be an un known tongue,\" said Lady Cecilia, after presenting me to our hostess, a good kind of roundabout woman, turbaned after the most approved fashion of countess-dowagerhood. \" This is a house of which it is indispensable to have the entree,\u2014 open first and last in the season, when nothing better is to be had.

In this house your passport to favour is an easy one. Lose a few guineas now and then at whist, and you will be free of the set. In that something more is wanting ; you must manage to make them laugh, either at or with you ; be very absurd, or very entertaining. It is a set, in short, where excitement is the order of the day, \u2014 full of lions, and other monsters, after their kind. But the succes of a mere lion is the short est of all possible successes. His popularity wears out before he has time to establish himself.\" \" And in what style do you intend me faire e'venement among these people ?\" said I, anxious to discover the designs upon me. \" I have scarely decided ! Pretty, well-dressed, lively, rich, dis engaged, with nothing to provoke that fretful porcupine, the world, to set its quills at you ; I think I shall produce you as an agreeability.\" \" Pray, don't ! I have not a set smile at my disposal ; and cannot give myself the trouble of looking and talking delightfully with all my might for the gratification of strangers.\" \"My dear, you must give yourself a few months' trouble, if you intend to be popular. Once established as an agreeability, your re putation will carry you on, season after season. But during this, your first spring in town, you must stand, cap in hand, in the market-place, lo secure the most sweet voices of the people worth knowing.\" \" But if I choose to be an independent member, and disdain the courtship of votes?\" \" Absurd ! no one living in society can be independent. The world is like a watch-dog, which fawns upon you, or tears you to pieces.

What a stifling of honourable sentiment 1 What a sacrifice of principle 1 Heaven preserve me from becoming a convert to Lady Cecilia's code of minor morals !

Madame Biais, for instance, knows not what to make of a lady who gives her the trouble of writing out an account in the midst of the hurry and bustle of the season. By the way, my dear, do you like Mr. Penrhyn? \" ' ' The man who sat so long with us last night at the opera ?\" \"So long, indeed, that I began to apprehend mischief from the double barrels of Mrs. Percy's lorgnette, steadily levelled at you during his visit.

Just now, she will not allow Penrhyn to call his soul his own; \u2014 writes him sentimental billets, keeps him listening to her guitar, or flageolet, or Jew's-harp, or accordion, or some such trash, merely that his cabriolet may be seen waiting at her door ; or stops him at Piccadilly Gate, lo be smiled at, and whispered to, through her carriage window, under the observation of fifteen hundred people passing by, and the Achilles standing still.

Lady Cecilia, too, has presented me to her own set of acquaintance ; many of them, I fear, \"pleasant, but wrong.\" I do not, at least, feel safe in their society ; nor can I help listening to ascertain whether the ice on which we are sliding together be not giving way under our feet. Would lhat Armine and my brother-in-law were arrived ! A pleasant dinner yesterday at Sir Richard and Lady Dunbar's : a well-appointed establishment\u2014 handsome plate, excellent cook. But one feels invited there to render them justice. Lady Dunbar piques herself on her proficiency in the etiquettes of life, and loves to impress you wilh due admiration of her savoir vivre ; but not a creature was ever welcomed to the house from the genuine impulse of hospitality. Their dinners have established them in society\u2014 obtained him the en tree of the best clubs\u2014 and, in some shower of coronets produced by the stormy state of the political atmosphere, will, perhaps, buy him into the peerage. \" Prejudice apart,\" whispered Mr. Penrhyn to me yesterday, at dinner, \"this potaged la financier deserves the Upper House.\" \" ,\". ., T , The first time I accompanied Lady Cecilia Delaval to old Lady Kent's card-party, I was much amused by the uneasy manner in"], [184, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. which she was addressed by a certain Lady Mardynville, \u2014 evidently in an agony lest Lady Cis should present the \"new woman\" to her. \"Have mercy on Sir Robert and Lady Mardynville, and do not look hard at them till they have ascertained lhat you are worthy of their acquaintance,\" whispered my friend, wilh assumed gravity. \"And what are they, of mine?\" I asked, as the baronet and his wife scudded fussily out of the way of an introduction. \"Heaven forbid that such pains-taking people should be lighlly spoken of,\" she replied. \"Two more persevering distinction-hunters never climbed the ladder of society. From the day of their sympa thetic union, they have neither eaten, drunk, nor slept, wilh any other object before their eyes than their own aggrandizement in those of the world. Not a levee, not a drawing-room, that they do not attend ; not a royal porter's book in which the names of Sir Robert and Lady Mardynville are not inscribed with 'damnable iteration;' not a ministerial lacquey, to whom their liveries are not familiar as Punch's puppet-show. They have deserted their family place, lo hire a residence within view of the Hag-staff of Windsor Castle ; and were heard to congratulate each other one winter, when their children caught Ihe measles at Brighton at the same moment with Prince George. Sir Robert used to answer every body's inquiries with assurances that little Bobby was better, and Prince George quite out of danger.\" Such was Cecilia's definition of the amiable couple who so mani festly despised me ; and last night, at the Dunbar's, they fully justified her diatribe. When they entered the room, the Duke of Merioneth happened to 'sit next me on the sofa, conversing in thai familiar whisper by which he thinks proper to mark to the world lhat he knows only those whom he knows intimately. The whisperee of a duke became, of course, a fine thing in the eyes of such people as the Mardynvilles. In the course of ten minutes, up came Lady Dunbar, all smiles, \u2014 Lady Mardynville, all courtesies, \u2014 determined to make my acquaintance. \"Long desirous of the honour \u2014 moving in the same circle \u2014 meet ing, night after night, without the privilege of speaking ; so excessively awkward,\" etc. ete.

C. 1 This morning arrived cards, and (without wailing to have them returned) an invitation for a dinner-party, three weeks hence.\u2014 Shan't go!

Yet, surely, the factions of Guelf and Ghibelline, or While"], [185, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 9 and Red Rose, never carried their barbarian animosities to so un christian a pilch, as the polite hatred of modern Whig and Tory? Since the triumph of the Catholic Question, political spleen has become a species of endemic at the west end ; a cholera morbus never to be extirpated. It is considered a mark of caste among Ihe fine ladies to \"doat on the Duke of Wellington,\" or to \"adore Ihe present mi nistry;\" the intellectual coteries affecting the latter creed, \u2014 the ex clusives, Ihe former. The ventilator, it seems, set Iheir brains a madding for a season or so; and, just as they all went hero-mad during the peninsular war, they became statesman-mad when the star of Canning, Brougham, or Stanley, raged as the dogstar of the hour. And then they so dearly love a little bit of finesse, to sneak their pitiful way to a vote, either at Brookes's or in the house. Madame L n was the first to bring this sort of tripotage into fashion. So well-bred, so well-dressed, nothing she did appeared amiss; like Cleopatra, \" Vilest things Became themselves in her, and holy bishops Blessed her when\" she advocated the cause of holy alliance. From her more than one flighty dame derives a precedent for a system of intrigue, such as the Duchesse de Longueville might rise from her grave to applaud. After all, the most able of female politicians makes herself as dis agreeable as ridiculous. Women carry Iheir sensibilities with them even into the ventilator, and exercise Iheir feelings when they fancy they are exercising Iheir judgment. They see through the eyes of their heart, and hear with ils ears ; and sometimes, unluckily, talk out of its abundance. Yesterday, at dinner at the Delavals', a gradually rising murmur reached us from the end of the table furthest from the place where I was quietly eating my soup, which, at length, deepened iuto a decided storm. Mrs. Percy and the old Duchess of Plymouth were speaking, what they call their minds, the plainest English ever uttered by lips polite ; each reviling the particular friends or particular party of the other. Lady Cecilia, who hates to have the pleasantness of her parties broken in upon, kept trying to pour oil upon the waves; but her oil was mere huilede roses, of loo light a quality lo subdue billows so uproarious; and Penrhyn, a dear lover of mischief, kept spurring the belligerents on to battle by little minikin-pin pricks of impertinence. Now, of what use was all their squabbling, either to their party (their party!) or themselves ? Not a word uttered by either, for argu ments they did not attempt to utter, would have weighed against an eider-duck's feather! On one side it was always \"It is well known that, if the duke thought proper, he might\" \u2014 so and so ; on the other,"], [186, "DIARY OF A D__SENNUY_-E. 10 \" Nothing but the paltry intrigues, and the under-hand cabals of the Tories have prevented\"\u2014 so and so. What a draw-back upon rational conversation and social feeling 1 Better talk to all eternity of the wea ther, as we used to do in Ireland ; or of chiffons, as 1 am told they do in Paris. Lady Cecilia declares lhat three or four of the best houses in town have become insupportable during the last few years, on account of Ihe state of parties ; among others, lhat of her charming sister, the marchioness ; where, \" Under which Club, Bezonian? Speak, or die !\" is the first inquiry made of every new pretender to her acquaintance. George Hanton, who sat next me yesterday, during this battle of iiogsand mice, could not conceal his indignation that the process of so good a dinner (when he happened to be in good appetite) should be dis turbed by such impertinent bickering 1 \"What bores those women are!\" he whispered to me, wilh a face of the deepest concern \u2014 \" I protest I hardly know what I have got on my plate!\" and, wilh Hanton, such ignorance is any-thing but bliss. I remember him, ten years ago, coming to pass the holidays at Lord Randall's, in Staffordshire, when Armine and I were young and disengaged; and then, as now, having eyes only for an entree. His lime and fortune are spent in ministering to his palate ; and a first-rate education seems to have instructed him in nothing but the gorman dizing of mankind. He recognizes the Spartans only by their black broth, and the Romans by the gluttonies of Apicius or Lucullus. Talk to him of the state of the arts during the middle ages, and he will an swer that, in those times, forest venison was a most delicious thing; and, in the way of chronology, instead of dating from \"before the in vention of gunpowder,\" or \" the discovery of printing,\" George is apt to time his epochs by \"before tea was brought into Europe,\" or \" be fore potatoes were in general use.\" His acquaintance, nay his friends, are chosen selon the merits of their cook, or their power of appreciat ing Ihe cooks of others. He was heard to exclaim of one of the greatest ministers of modern limes, \" I have a bad opinion of Lord . I once saw what pretended to be a supreme de volaille at his table, which was literally made of veal.\" \"And what then \u2014 do you suppose he ordered such a substitute?\" \"No ! \u2014 but what an opinion must his cook have had of his under standing, to venture on such a subterfuge ; and, after all, who knows one better than one's cook?\" \u2014 Hanton has dropped the acquaintance of the Mardynvilles, because their turbot is high instead of their venison, and refused to be presented to pretty little Lady Ryland, on account of the badness of her dinners. \"It is time lost,\" said he, \"to know such people.\" He invariably places himself next me at dinner ; and"], [187, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 11 I have discovered that my ignorance of gastronomic science constitutes my attraction. I have not taste enough to secure the truffles, or the beaux morceau\u00e6 of the made-dishes brought round ; and Mr. Hanton, as my next neighbour, profits by the oversight. I fear he will judge me unworthy of an invitation to one of his dinners, which I hear highly extolled by Ihose, bien entendu, who hold That to live well means nothing but to eat. May 1. \u2014 What a beautiful city is London at this season of the year, when the spring breezes, dispersing both fog and smoke, afford glimpses of blue sky ! What order in the streets; \u2014 what courtesy, what splendour in Ihe shops ! \u2014 Regent Street, for instance, with its macadamized road covered wilh carriages, and wide pavements thronged wilh passengers, is a very type of the times ; \u2014 all show and speculation, all activity and superficiality. Then the west end squares, and the streets leading into Park Lane, \u2014 how dignisiedly dull ; \u2014 \"nothing lo be seen there,\" as some would-be Brummel observed, \" but the aris tocracy, savoir, a population of Lords and footmen.\" Each isolated mansion of that savoured region contains, within its little world, all that ingenuity and industry tender in exchange for wealth ; the best productions of art, the newest combinations of science, the most grace ful inventions of fancy ; to render life more easy and exquisite for those who know not a discomfiture beyond the rumpling of the rose leaf! Then, the two new quarters that arose under the reign of that king ofthe surfaces, George IV! \u2014 the Regent's Park, \u2014 the Athens of the Bloomsburians; and Belgrave and Eaton Squares, \u2014 the Place Ven dome, and Place de Louis XV., of our new lords and old bankers. \u2014 There live the opulent and the ascendant, \u2014 the Dunbars and the Mardynvilles. There dines Hanton, \u2014 there flirts Mrs. Percy ; \u2014 while my friend Lady Cecilia, more aristocratic in her predilections, clings to the sobrieties of Grosvenor Square ; whose ancient hall-chairs are polished, not by French varnish, but by much friction of genera tions of lacqueys, from the time when the link of Lady Mary Worlley's chairman was thrust into the extinguisher, still suspended over the entrance ! Then we have Carlton Gardens, \u2014 the Hesperides of Cabinet Minis ters, \u2014 which shifts its occupants with every change of administration. Were the ghosts of Fox and Sheridan to arise from the Abbey in the mists of some November morning, how would they marvel to behold the classic ground of Carlton House devoted to the hubbub of con servative clubs, or the gorgeous vulgarity of such satraps as Sir Bunga lore Hooghly and Co.! Till within these fifteen years, however, the domestic architecture of"], [188, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 12 London hobbled sar behind the march of luxury. A handsome town residence was then a show-house ;\u2014 bath-rooms, a gallery, and a little marble, and plate-glass, constituted a palace ; and, lo ! there are now squares\u2014 full of mansions fit for princes lo be ruined in! Not an agent's book but contains a dozen attainable by the week or season, where you may live as Thelusson, or the Duchess of Gordon, sove reignized some forty years ago. The immediate consequence of this diffusion of brick and mortar seems lo be the evacuation of the city. Instead of the wealthy mer chants, and great bankers, once resident in the vast, square, roomy mansions of its dark and narrow lanes, I learn lhat not a merchant of eminence sleeps within sc.-ind of Bow Bell ; and hence the difficulty of appropriately filling up those civic offices, formerly so eminent in their illustration. The commodious dwellings of the great capitalists have been converted into warehouses, or are inhabited by clerks; and the thinly populated city is twice as wholesome, and half as dignified. The Regent's Park, meanwhile, extends its stuccoed terraces ;\u2014 and London seems lo stretch its gigantic arms, and gape for air, \u2014 like some mighty monster, awaking from a trance. It might afford me a useful lesson, that so many of my new visitors were, by the way, friends of my imprudent predecessors here, and fed on their undoing. \" Aha !\" drawled little Mrs. Percy, on her first visit, \u2014 \"I see you have got the Thistledown's love of a house, \u2014 the prettiest little toy shop in London. \" Foolish people! \u2014 They would do things to which they had no pretension; \u2014 swam out of Iheir depth, and sank for ever.\" \"Or rather, like the Flying Fish in Ihe fable,\" observed Penrhyn (who \"happens\" to drop in wherever her carriage is seen stopping), \" they got out of their element, and were pecked to death by Ihe birds, into whose nest they had intruded. People thought them silly and presuming, even when their silliness and presumption were upheld by a charming house, excellent establishment, and select dinner-parties ; but when we found, lhat even these were assumption, no words can describe our indignation at their impertinence ! \"Mrs. Thistledown had passed for a pretty woman, we now thought her a fright, and called her ' that Mrs. Thistledown.' He had been regarded as a frank well-natured man ; we now decided him to be a tiger ! What became of either we neither knew nor inquired. It was sufficiently horrible that we had been dining and supping with people not fairly entitled to give, us dinners or suppers.\" \"Indeed, I did inquire,\" said Mrs. Percy, incapable of discerning between her friend's serious and ironical vein, \" and I was told they were in prison. Of course, there was an end of the thing.\""], [189, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 13 \" And there might have been an end of the people,\" said Penrhyn, laughing. \" They are morally dead \u2014 defunct, lo all intents and pur poses. Let them sleep in peace.\" \"Particularly as we find dear Mrs. Delaval so satisfactorily esta blished in their place,\" was Mrs. Percy's well-turned rejoinder. But Mrs. Percy's heartlessness is by no means unique. Most of my new friends (and many among them should know better) have entered with a similar ejaculation. \"Ah! by the way, Ihis is poor Thistledown's house. Didn't he die, or something of that sort? Ruined? \u2014 Ah! very Iruel \u2014 I re collect now. He played \u2014 both hazard and the fool \u2014 and was done up before one had made up one's mind whether he was a man to be known. Howard was rash enough to put him up at White's ; which was amazingly wrong of Howard, who has himself only one leg to stand upon.\" \" Now, do just look at those Dresden vases, and those Marque terie consoles ; and think of the absurdity of a fellow like Thistle down venturing on such fancies 1 A man with barely income enough for mahogany and Wedgwood-ware, to presume to have a taste !\" \" Well ! \u2014 he has met wilh his deserts ; and his dinners we all met wilh 1\" added a Jekyling. \" Just imagine that I sent cards here to the Thistledowns this sea son, quite forgetting they were done up !\" drawled Lady Grace Gos ling. \" Had it nol been for my good fortune in knowing Mrs. Delaval, and recognizing Ihis little humming-bird's nest of Iheirs, I should never have thought of Ihem again.\" Such is the worldliness of the world I Thus easily are broken those brittle ties of spun-glass, which one forms in the chance-med ley ofa season. People are true to Iheir relations, and faithful to their friends ; but how few make it a matter of principle to be true to Iheir acquaintances 1 Formed by an exchange of courtesies and cards, on some acc/idental temptation (such as Lady A. 's desire to flirt with Lord B. at Lady Cs ball, and Lady Cs desire to have her ball adorned by the presence of Lady A.'s diamond necklace), London acquaint anceships barely survive their ephemeral day, unless revived by some further motive of expediency. There seems to be a distinct profession sprung up of late years, which, for want of a better designation, I shall call acquaintance-bro kerage. Certain dowagers of note undertake to patronise balls for acquaintanceless people; and go about, promising and vowing, in their name, that the music and supper shall be excellent. Many of these acquaintance-brokers perform their functions in all honesty ; and sim ply give an agreeable fete to their own visiting list, at the house of a Colonel Crab or a Mrs. Brown, with a proviso lhat visiting cards shall"], [190, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 14 be left for the Crab or the Brown on the following day. Others exer cise their functions with Judas-like treachery. \" My dear Lady Laura, you must come on Thursday night to some new people in Hereford Street, whom I have promised to patronise;\" or, \" My dear duke, I have undertaken this ball in Hereford Street for the\u2014 What's their names? I am bored to death with the whole affair, and will posi tively never trouble myself with such a corvee again. But you will greatly oblige me by looking in for a minute or two.\" Sometimes they are still less deferential towards Iheir protege's ; and Ihe more exclusive dandies are persuaded to go and sup at No. 10A, Harley street, without a word of the name or nature of ils proprietor. \" I always bow to the diamond necklace nearest the door on entering, when I am invited in this way,\" said Sir Harry Andover to me, in describing the brokerage system, \u2014 \"and take it for granted that 1 have made myself free of the house.\" \"' A year or two ago,\" said Penrhyn, who sometimes plays the mo ralist, among his other parts of exquisite dissembling, \" there came up from Wales some rich mine-people, who had a mind to push forward into society. A ball seemed their readiest mounting-stone, and a ball they determined to give, under the sponsorship of some Lady Ap Shenkin or other, the wife of a Welsh baronet neighbour. The com pany assembled by the lady of the leek, was of the kind called \" highly respectable ;\" \u2014 brother baronets and sister baronetesses, \u2014 Portland Place directors and directresses, \u2014 admirals, generals, lord and lady chief justices, et hoc genus omne; most of them party-givers, as well as party-goers ; and the new people were invited to some two hundred humdrum entertainments in exchange for their one. So far, so fair ! But, among the admirals' wives, alas I was a Lady Lavinia Tarpaulin, who had sprit-sailed her way through a fashionable winter at Brigh ton ; and, in the course ofthe evening, contrived to make it known to the acquaintance seekers, that she would have made Iheir baronets, lords ; and their ladies, ladies in waiting. Next year, accordingly, Lady Lavinia undertook their ball, and Lady Ap Shenkin was com pelled to own to the hundred applicants for her interest to obtain a ticket, that she herself was omitted from the new list. \" How contemptible ! \" \" Contemptible enough ! but to reach half way up the ladder of par venuism, serves only to dazzle and dizzy the unwary. The wings of our pretenders had now sprouted ; Ihe following year, Lady Lavinia heard of them as having been undertaken by a dowager duchess, and saw no more of them.\" \" And the dowager duchess ?\" \" Doubled them up, and laid them on the shelf. Their means had been just equal to the calibre of a Lady Ap Shenkin. To merit the"], [191, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 15 patronage of a Lady Lavinia, they engaged twice as good a house and establishment ; and Lo ! two turtles smok'd upon the_board ! But, for the level of her grace, a French cook and St. James's Square seemed indispensable ; and that last campaign in London, sent them to Glamorganshire ; lionized to utter extinction.\" By the way, my friend, Lady Cis, is something of a mistress of the ceremonies. With respect to myself, as Sir Jenison is the head of Colonel Delaval's family, she could do no less than present me to her clique. But she is too apt to traffic in little notes of nothingness, using all the insinuations that satin paper and phrases de caresse can supply, to get Mrs. This invited to the duke's ball, and Lady That no ticed by the duchess. On Wednesday mornings she is always in a nervous flutter of spirits, about a voucher for Miss Ellen, or a sub scription for Lady Sophia. Mr. Penrhyn, indeed, declares \u2014 but I am not sure that his declarations would grace the pages of my journal . Heigho ! what an infinite deal of nothing have, I already written down! In malice? \u2014 I hope not! It was my desire to comment upon things, rather than upon persons; or, if persons, those whose conversation was improving, and whose example edifying. Living, as I have done, in what the Americans would call \" the bush,\" I longed to form for myself a circle of enlightened men and women, \u2014 the makers, not the ingredients, of society ; people who, while they walk with the century, are able to give a guess at the century to come. But one of Lady Cecilia's first and most earnest interdictions was against entangling myself in a bureau d' esprit. Nothing, she protests, so dan gerous ! Lady , it seems, has brought the thing into disrepute, by fawning on every creature that wears a quill'; by which means, in dividuals have been introduced into society, whom it is as unsafe to know as to decline knowing. \"Pore over their books as much as you please, but do not so much as dip into the authors !\" said she, when I proposed an introduction to one o. the most popular writers of the day. ' ' These people expend their spirit on their works ; the part that walks through society, is a mere lump of clay, \u2014 like the refuse of the wine-press after the wine has been expressed. In conversing wilh a clever author, you some times see a new idea brighten his eye, or create a smile round his lip ; but for worlds he would not give it utterance. It belongs to his next work, \u2014 and is instantly booked in the ledger of his daily thoughts \u2014 value three and sixpence. The man's mind is his mine, \u2014 he can't af ford to work it gratis, or give away the produce.\" Armine and her husband are come at last ! \u2014 The happiest moment I have experienced in London, was that in which, for the first time"], [192, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE 16 these four years, I folded her in my arms ! \u2014 Highly as I regard my brother-in-law , I should have been just as well pleased had Herbert allowed my first interview with my sister to be a tete-a-tete ,- but wa shall meet every day for the next three months, and find plenty of op portunities to talk over things and people whom I could not frankly discuss in his presence ; indeed, I was quite sufficiently taken up with examining his wife, and noting the progress of time in her dear fami liar face. And how dear, \u2014 how very dear, \u2014 is a familiar face, beheld after long estrangement ! They may talk of returning to the scenes of our youth, \u2014 the old mansion, the well-known orchard, the fa vourite hawthorn hedge, \u2014 but restore to me the sunny smile, the open countenance, the loving eyes of her who made those scenes delightful ; \u2014 there is a positive happiness, worth worlds of poetry. But, after all, is this possible? \u2014 The spring comes with its blossoms lo the old orchard, and the genial month of May brightens up the fra grant hawthorn hedge, as when first a sheet of snow-white blossoms was flung over its early verdure; while human life boasts but its single spring! After one brief summer, the face and feelings go out of bloom together; and who can bear to see the hollowing eye, the sallowing cheek, the contracting brow, we remember so bright with the impulses of youth? But J, too, am growing poetical, and this my journal is solemnly pledged to matter of fact. Idylliumism apart \u2014 I was grieved to per ceive that the cares of life had somewhat tarnished the beautiful face of my sister. Surely vanity does not mislead me into believing lhat, although a year younger than myself, she might pass for ten years my senior? Yet / have spent a life of disappointment and repining, while she is unconscious of a single sorrow. Have I less depth of feeling less force of character, than my sister? \u2014 Perhaps so! \u2014 Perhaps she has grieved for me. Perhaps her regrets for the weary and unprofit-ble years I have been passing, have created a care for her ? \u2014 But I foiget ! \u2014 Armine has four children; and experience has not initialed me into the pains and pleasures produced by the responsibility of mcther hood. The unfavourable change I noticed in Armine's looks, struck lie still more forcibly in the manners of her husband. Herbert, although an excellent, is certainly not an ingratiating person. He is fond of naked truths, and I am modest enough to like even the truth a liltle drapee. Armine admired my house. Herbert w as silent till she questioned him. \" Is it not charming? Is it not a perfect bijou ?\" \" By bijou, I conclude you mean trinket?\" he replied; \" which perfectly explains my objection to it. Trinkets are not for daily use; and this house seems made for any thing but to live in. I dare say I am wrong, \u2014 but I detest gimcracks.\""], [193, "DIARY OF A DESENNCYEE. 17 \" It was fitted up for your poor friend Thistledown,\" added Armine, apparently with a view to his conciliation. \" Was it?\u2014 I should have fancied it fitted up for an actress,\" re plied Herbert, rising, and trying to look through the conservatory into the Park. Ass as Thistledown was, I should have hardly thought him capable of spoiling a sine prospect like this, by planting it out with ge raniums.\" This is the sirst ungracious word I have heard respecting my pretty house; and, perhaps, the only sincere one! At all events, the thing might have been said more courteously. Some people are perpetually declaring \u2014 \" I told him plainly ;\" as if one had a right to tell another a thing \" plainly !\" \u2014 Better tell it \" prettily,\" and the lesson is learned wilh patience. Significant looks passed between Armine and her husband, at the mention of several persons I named, as my intimate associates. Had he not been there, she would have probably explained herself; but Herbert showed such a disposition to be uncivil, by observing, \" All these are Lady Cecilia's people. She, I conclude, has been your bear leader;\" that my sister seemed afraid of provoking further comment. To-morrow, I shall manage to see her alone ; and inquire her objections to the Percys, Penrhyn, Lady Grace Gosling, and others. I was at Almack's to-night for the sirst time; \u2014 most brilliant! \u2014 most beautiful ! I dined first wilh Cecilia, and sat next Hanton ; who, between the courses, noticed that Ihefraichettr of my toilet was equal to that of the mullet, \u2014 a great compliment from him. \" You are going to a ball, eh? \u2014 Great Heaven ! how can people de router themselves by going to balls? \u2014 Hot rooms \u2014 noisy music \u2014 dust \u2014 citric acid ices \u2014 and spurious champagne! \u2014 Your appetite nauseated next day, and your temples beating out of time like a blacksmith's anvi[i \u2014 And Almack's too, \u2014 a public ball! \u2014 I look upon Almack's as the worst thing going.\" My gaiete de c\u0153ur was not to be damped by his affectation ; and when the clock struck eleven, I entered, on Cecilia's arm, lhat long and echoing ball-room, where so many hearts, promises, and fans, have been broken, \u2014 from the time of hoop petticoats and red-heeled pumps, to those of aerophane crape and patent varnish. The ball room, without much elegance of architecture or decoration, is gay and well-lighted. It has been noticed, and I think truly, that there is not in London a room where beauty looks more beautiful. Nothing there to distract attention from the human face divine ; \u2014 no pictures \u2014 no statues \u2014 no gilding \u2014 no porcelain \u2014 no flowers. You have pretty music to listen to, pretty faces lo look at, and the best society, in the easiest and most agreeable way. Paris, Vienna, Naples, have nothing to compare with Almack's : no weekly point de reunion, where people \u2022_>"], [194, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 18 are sure of meeting those who suit them and whom they suit. But then, in what other capital does fashion hold a reign so absolute as in London ? Where was the throne of exclusivism ever so firmly esta blished as at Almack's ! The very fine complain that the things is en decadence, and no longer the D.lliai Lama-ish temple that it was \" In my cold youth, when George the Fourth was king.\" But no matter! It is still the conservatory, par excellence, for our budding roses and rare exotics ; the rendezvous for seeing with the least possible trouble the greatest possible number of one's acquaintances. What a host of hands were extended to me to-night by old friends ! what curtsies innumerable was I forced to perform in honour of new introductions'! Lady Cecilia is of opinion that, as my house is not large enough to give a ball (a thing which amounts to a publication of one's visiling list), I may as well know every body, and go only lo those whom I think desirable. An apology is easily sent to people one wishes to send to Coventry ! Among other merits, Almack's has the especial privilege of affording the only classic (ball) ground for ministerial and political celebrities. Lord North frowned therein his time; Lord Casllereagh (Holly-al liance Casllereagh), in hii', and the great men of to-day follow in the steps of ihose of yesterday. To-night we had , looking sallow and saturnine, but sentimental withal ; and I am sure that his oratory is apt lo touch as many hearts as heads. Thursday morning. \u2014 Having had my horses out lill nearly four, I shall not be able to get lo the Herberts' to-day. But as Armine can command her husband's arm, I hope she will walk to me. Six o'clock, and my room only just clear of morning visitors! I am tired out wilh chit-chat, \u2014 buried under a shower of rose-leaves ! First came Lady Evelyn Bercsford, all soflnessand grace, who never speaks above a whisper, and dies of every breath of air, even in a westerly wind. She has always a very little cough \u2014 so small, that it seems like the voice of the invisible girl, to come oui of another room; and just now, poor Lady Evelyn \" Dies of a rose in Hom\u0153opathic pain ; ' dines at three o'clock, on half a snipe, and keeps her children in Lanca shire, being too nervous to bear their noise within two hundred miles of her great rambling house in Privy Gardens. She comes to lown for the season, only to put herself under the tortures of the newest fashionable quack; and is all amazement that any one can bear the fatigue of dressing and the exhauslion of hot rooms, lt is needless to remind her lhat her own demi-toilette costs her twice the trouble of"], [195, "DIARY OF A DESENNUY&E. 19 our ball dresses, or lhat the thermometer in her boudoir stands at 85\u00b0. She has no faith in Ihe indispositions of other women. Most of us ex perience a jealous pang on hearing the beauty of some rival lauded, apparently at our own expense ; but Lady Evelyn is as tenacious of Ihe word \"invalid,\" as Mrs. Percy of the terms \" wit\" or \" belle.\" \" They talk of the Duchess of being delicate,\" said she, in an indignant tone, this morning; \"a woman who has nursed all her child ren must have the constitulion of an Irish charwoman !\" She will not even allow one of her friends to be ill, \u2014 hints that it is an idle pretension, \u2014 and has actually misgivings of imposition, after they are dead and gone. Sir Jenison Delaval came in before she left me; who, being a con stitutional croaker, a dear lover of bad tidings \u2014 (Lady Cis declares that, had he been sent for news out of the ark, he would have brought back a sprig of yew instead of an olive-branch 1) informed us that Lord Clendinning had lost his wife. \"Lady Clendinning dead?\" cried Lady Evelyn. \"Impossible! you must have been misinformed!\" \" I fear not. She died last night.' \" Last night? \u2014 oh dear, no. Mr. Beresford was with his father yesterday morning, just after Dr. Holland had left the house ; and Hol land gave it as his opinion lhat she was in no sort of danger. Holland is aware of her foible of fancying herself ten times worse than she really is.\" \" In this case, poor woman, her fancy was confirmed. She said she should not live through the day, and expired in the course of the evening.\" \"My dear Sir Jenison, believe me, it was some other person. Lady Clendinning is One of the last women in the world to die in that sort of way, of a common cold.\" \"But it was not a common cold \u2014 it was an inflammation of the lungs.\" \"Well! common or uncommon, I know she was at Devonshire House on Thursday week ; and you may rely upon it she is no more dead than I am.\" \" It was precisely at Devonshire House that she had some difficulty in getting up her carriage,\u2014 stood in a draught of air without her cloak,\u2014 and never quitted her bed afterwards. Blisters, bleeding, leeches \u2014 nothing could save her.\" \" How very absurd ! Lady Clendinning has a horror of blisters \u2014 never put one on in her life; and as to bleeding, the very sight of a lancet would cure her. I shall go and call on her to-morrow.\" \" Better not, my dear madam.

Now that I have seen him again, and studied him at leisure, I heartily rejoice at not having been warmer in my acceptation of his civilities. Lord Lancaster seems to be an adept in that fashionable school of superciliousness which renders young Eng lishmen so ridiculous. Till the age of thirty, your listless lord takes refuge in finery from his own insignificance \u2014 .knows nobody, \u2014 goes nowhere, \u2014 can sind nothing to eat, \u2014 nothing to read, \u2014 is very little aware of what you are saying to him, and still less of what he utters in reply. After thirty, unless improved by having amalgamated with reasonable society, he retreals anew into whatever may be the pet club of the day \u2014 White's, the Travellers', Crockford's, or a successor, still to arise. From that moment he knows nobody but the fellows at the club ; goes nowhere but to the club ; admits ol no eating but the dinners or suppers of Ihe club \u2014 no reading but its journals and periodicals. He meels a man in society, and if a member of the same, offers to put him down there; if not a member, but worthy so to be, he offers lo put him up there. That goodly community he holds lo constitute the human species; for him ihere is no world elsewhere ! Lord Lancaster is al present in the incipient stage of listlessnessism. At present, he knows nothing, and nobody, on the face of the created globe. He came inlo my drawing-room, evidently prepared for a tete-d-tele, and to make it agreeable to both parlies; but the moment he saw Sir Jenison Delaval, a man with whom he has no visiting acquaintance, he froze into a stalue of snow, to make it evident, lhat an introduction to the stranger was out of the question. Instead of his florid eloquence of last night, he emitted only monosyllables in reply lo the diffuse commentary on Ihe weather, wilh which I was obliged to fill up the awkward pause (hat ensued, and, instead of his graceful ease on Ihe satin sofa at Almack's among those certified of his caste, he"], [197, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 21 turned his eyes neither to the right nor left, lest, peradventure, they should fall upon an object of dubious recognizabilily. So complete a a man in buckram never was it my lot to see. Before his lordship's joints could be unslissened, or his dignity re laxed, by the departure of poor unconscious Sir Jenison, in rattled Count Szchazoklwonski, a wild Hungarian, and a great friend of Lady Cecilia, who has a propensity for tattling bad English. \"Ha! my freind, Sare Delafals!\" cried he, \"enchanted to met you. Receife your polite cart of dinner \u2014 will axcep, most happee. Who thatstranshe mans?\" whispered he, leaning towards me. \" Lord Lancaster,\" replied I, in the same low lone. \" Lancasters? do I not know heem? an Irizh peer, eh, yees?\" \" A Scotch one, I believe,\" said I, amused by his barbaresque self possession, under the scrutinizing glances of the exclusive. \"Scosh? aha! Scosh, I link. Good day, milor, good day, your shervanlh. You are of Scoshland, I find. I have great regard for Scoshland. I go to Scoshland, last, sheason, shoot the moors ; lees on groushe and veeshky, veeshky and groushe ; I have great regard for Scoshland. Pray, milor, can you told me vare I gets di genoing Scosh peel ?\" \"Peel?\" reiterated his lordship. \" Count Szchazoklwonski probably means Scotch marmalade, made of orange-peel,\" said I, in perfect simplicity. \" I means no such tings,\" cried the count; \" widsh your kind for give me, I means peel, \u2014 Scosh peel, \u2014 veesh I look ven indishpose, in de moor; and veesh cure me like wonder!\" \" Scotch pills,\" cried I, unable to repress a laugh. But it was no laughing matter. The colour rose to Lord Lancaster's temples, and he pulled up his collar with a jerk, as he would have pulled up a hard-mouthed horse. \"Your friend seems to lake me for an apothecary,\" said he, address ing me ; but disdaining to notice the count. \" Million pardonsh, milor,\" replied Szchazoklwonski, amazed at having given offence: \"miladi spoke you as peer of Scoshland; thought you very natural know de Scosh peel.

But, just as I had reached the gale of the Green Park, a gentleman, who had been cantering gently along Constitution Hill, drew up, gave his horse lo his groom, and I found myself escorted by Mr. Penrhyn. \" Am I indiscreet in inquiring whither Mrs. Delaval is bound at so unseasonable an hour?\" said he. \" Is it some benevolent action that takes you abroad so early ?

Not the wife, I trust, of a certain morose Henry Herbert, with whom I used to quarrel at Eton and Christ church?\" \" A certain Henry Herbert, certainly, and both of Eton and Ox ford; but by no means a morose one.\" \" My hearty congratulations, then, to his fair lady, on the refor mation she has effected ! To do poor Herbert justice, he had some pretext for ill-humour. It has been his fate, through life, to come in second best. His father is an old baronet, wilh a princely estate; but my friend was born eleven months after a stout, thriving, active, elder brother. Till ten years old, he was himself a handsome lad; caught the small-pox, and became honey-combed for life ! His younger brother has changed his name for a fortune, left him by a rich god mother; his elder succeeded to the title and family property. Henry Herbert, I conclude, is still Henry Herbert: a man without a pro fession, because he is so near being a man of fortune ; but who, with his independence of 1785/. per annum, is the most dependent of human beings !

The table was covered with cold tea, stiffened muffins, warm butter, tepid coffee, empty egg-shells! The husband was grumbling over the denunciations of an opposilion pa per; the wife trying to silence the chattering children, who prevented his croakings from becoming audible! \"Why, my dear Armine, did not Herbert bring you to see me yesterday ?\" I inquired, as soon as I had taken my place. \" He thought il would be far easier for your carriage and horses to bring you to see us,\" replied Herbert, taking up his own defence. \"My horses and servants had been oui all night.\" \" Yourself, of course, remaining at home?\" \"No. If you remember, I told you I was going to Almack's; and last night, I was at Merioneth House.\" \"But people do not remain all night at Almack's; and you (and your horses) were not at Merioneth House, I imagine, before ten o'clock?\" \"Not till eleven. But I was not sure of finding you, if I came in the evening.\" \" There were two good arguments that your sister, at least, would be at home. Like most recently arrived country cousins, she has no thing to wear ; and, like most poor men's wives, no horses to drive.\" \"Let us go to the drawing-room, and talk over your parties of last night,\" cried Armine, the peace-maker; \"it is enough that you are here at last.\" And to the drawing-room I followed her, leading one little stumbling girl, who did not choose lo be carried, while she carried a heavy boy, who did not choose to walk. But even the drawing-room was cal culated to throw a damp on our spirits. Armine's arrival in town is so recent, that her house has not yet acquired an inhabited look. The lustres are in canvass bags; the frames of the glasses and pic tures under dirty gauze.

' ' No thing so charming as a fifth-rale London house, to people who enter tain the foolish ambition of deserting a comfortable residence, to come to town for the season.\" \"But you used to like London?\" said I. a< Yes when I had nothing else to like, and a club was my substi- tute for a home. But, with four children, and scarcely two thousand a-year, I am content to remain in Bedfordshire. Indeed, this will be decidedly Ihe last year of our coming. Next season, I shall let this confounded smoky hole, and get three or four hundred pounds for it from some valetudinarian member, wanting to be near the Parks. By Ihe way, what have you done with Penrhyn? \u2014 I saw him walk up to the door wilh you ?\" \" Then you also saw him turn away as I entered?\" \" With no small satisfaction ! I was afraid he might not be aware how little I am disposed to welcome such a visitor.

You know him to be rich, only because he is purse proud; nay, he almost laments the prosperily which leaves him no excuse for being a pique-assiette.

I detest a hus band eternally squabbling in a tete-a-tete, but becoming bright and sunshiny the moment a visitor is announced! My visil to my sister was rendered thoroughly unpleasant by Herbert's want of self-control. Yet, had he been in any house but his own, he would have suffered the chimney to smoke, the children to squall, and the breakfast-lable lo look disorderly, without allowing his temper to be ruffled. I would not hear of his walking back wilh me lo St. James's Place; and even allowed him to surmise that Mr. Penrhyn was waiting in the Park to offer me his arm. It was quite a relief to me, and, I fancy, to his wife, when, finding his services refused, he took himself off to his club. After all, clubs are not altogether so bad a thing for family-men- They act as conductors to the storms usually hovering in the air. The man forced to remain at home, and vent his crossness on his wife and children, is a much worse animal lo bear with lhan Ihe man who grumbles hisway lo Pall-Mail, and, not daring to swear at the club servants, or knock about Ihe club furniture, becomes socialized into de cency. Nothing like the subordination exercised in a community of equals, for reducing a fiery temper. It is not the influence of the co lonel or the major which curbs the violence of the irascible young en sign, so much as that of his brother ensign, who joined six months be fore him, and is already subdued lo the discipline ofthe regiment. I dare say Herbert is tolerably amicable in his own neighbourhood, among squires of his own fortune and degree. Luckilv, there are times and places where all Ihe world puts on its company face. At Merioneth House, last night, what a host of smilers ! Not a jealous scowl, not an envious sneer, not an angry frown lo be seen ! In spite of all the rivalship, all the vindictive seeling, pent up in Ihe sour hundred human breasts drawing breath under ils gorgeous roof, all was courtesy, all kindness. Not a care presumed to show ils face in lhat fairy palace. A temple of joy, \u2014 its votaries must be joyous. After an hour or two passed in such a spot, one might almoslbecomea convert lo the notion of the poor, that, in this world at least, Dives, in his purple and sine linen, is exempt from tribulation. It is, perhaps, owing to the domestic plagues which subdued my temper, that I resided so many years at Delaval Caslle, surrounded by mud hovels, without imagining lhat, because I was lady of all I sur veyed, I was paramount in all other times and places. Nothing, I per ceive, is so unpretending as a thoroughly Londonized person. There, gentlemen are accustomed to give way to lords ; lords to royalties ; and society is nicely matched, each under each, as the voices of the hounds of Theseus.

The other night, at Almack's, I nolieed Sir William O'Blarney, who has a family- place some miles from Rallyshumna, and was accounted a fine thing in Dublin, pushing and shoving in a crowd of peers and peeresses, as he would have done in a mob in Sackville Street ! He could not conceive why they did not make room for him and his partner ; and fancied himself as grand and inlluenlial in the presence of Ihe Duke of Wel- lington, Lord Grey, two or three German sovereign princes, and two or three hundred of the leading nobility, as when receiving the obei- sances of a dozen hatless and shoeless retainers, in whose eyes Sir William O'Blarney, own cousin, twice removed, to my Lord O'Blar- nay, of Blarney Castle, in the county of Fermanagh, is secondary in i.nportance only to the Prince of Wales 1 To do poor Sir William justice, his partner, Lady Theodosia Farinafad, seemed quite as well inclined lo assert her mistaken dignity as himself, I saw her plant herself before one of the fairest and gentlest of the Howards, who was forced to retreat, and find a place in another quadrille; and the disdainful air with which Sir William and herself surveyed, from force of habit, all and sundry in the room, was really amusing. At last, as they were elbowing their way together towards Lady Theodosia's chaperon, I saw the ridiculous couple stand as if conscious of a superior presence, and doubted not that a member of the royal family had come in. I raised my glass ; but, lo! in lieu of a royal highness, saw no- thing but a fat old dowager, \u2014 a quondam lady-lieutenant. Sir William, remembering how low he used lo bow lo her at Ihe Caslle, having re sumed his former obsequiousness. Great as he was, he felt an ex-vice- queen to be greater. The minnows shrank in presence of what had been a Triton in Iheir little eyes. Lister was right in his assertion that travel is indispensable to liberal ize the mind. After making the lour of Europe, Sir William O'Blarney will probably return to his country, a polished, open-hearted man. But il will require many a rub to leach him the useful art of self-knowledge. One lesson was bestowed on him the other night. Lady Cecilia's sister, Ihe somewhat exclusive Marchioness of Clackmannan, sent for her car riage, and look away her beautiful daughter, Lady Alicia Spotliswode, Ihe moment Sir William asked her to dance. \" It is Alicia's sirst sea son,\" whispered Lady Cecilia, observing my suppressed smile ; \"et il ne sunt pas s'encanailler.\" Do not let me seem lo scandalize my Irish friends. I see nothing in London \u2014 no ! not even at Merioneth House \u2014 superior to Lord and LadyRossana, or their sons and daughters. But Ihe Rossanas are people of the world ; and have supported the reputalion of Iheir country for beauty and wit, at Paris, Rome, Naples, Vienna, and Berlin. It struck me 'last night, lhat Mr. Penrhyn was paying"], [203, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 27 attention to the youngest and prettiest of the daughters. But I am satisfied lhat Lady Sophia has too much dignity of mind to accept a man universally stigmatized as the cavaliere servente of a married woman. Poor Sir Jenison Delaval has just attained a crisis in his destiny, which makes tho matrimonial yoke he has been wearing, till it has grown inlo his flesh, sit extremely uneasy. Clarence Delaval, his only son, who has turned out as wild as the slip of such a stock was likely to prove, has just been rusticated at college ; and his father and Lady Cecilia are at variance touching his suture destination. Lady Cis wants to send him to travel, and, on his return from the Continent, place him in the Blues : Sir Joseph talks of keeping him under his own eye (such an eye as it is !), and pulling him into Ihe Foreign Office or the Treasury, to tame him down. The idea of the hand some, clever Clarence, chained to a desk in a Government office, would make Lady Cecilia furious, if it did not make her laugh. But, while papa and mamma are settling their differences of opinion, my little cousin, Clarence, remains en penitence in Grosvenor Square ; smuggled by his mother, night after night, to Ihe Opera, Almack's, and every ball worth mentioning, in order to keep him out of mischief; or, rather, to keep him to mischief of what she considers the right kind. \"A boy of twenty mu st play the fool,\" is her argument; \"and it is belter he should play the fool in good company. Precisely at Clarence's age, the tone of a man's character is decided. If shy, he flies lo indifferent society to be courted and made a fuss with; if a sportsman, he associates with those who look upon ignorance as emi nence, and vulgarity as virtue. Wilh us, he will perceive that gal lantry and ecarle are not incompatible wilh public distinctions ; he will see our great politicians crowned with laurels mingled with roses, and sind that a man may command the attention of the House one night, and of Crockford's the next. If my son must be a roue, let him, at least, be a roue de bonne compagnie.\" Sir Jenison, on the other hand, does not subscribe to the necessity of his being a roue at all ; and talks of Ihe propriety of finishing the young man's education, in case he should be called on by his county to bring him forward at the next election. But Lady Cecilia, who says little, does all ; and, as Clarence finds it delightful to waltz every night, and ride every morning, with his pretty cousin Alicia, itis probable he will manage to remain in town for the rest ofthe season, then complete his education on the moors, or at Lucca, or the Taunus baths. Ever since my arrival in town, I have seen a huge \" TO LET, FURMSHED, this spacious Mansion,\" pasted into the windows"], [204, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 28 of the house adjoining mine; and fully appreciated the advantage 'of having no greater disturbance to my South-west, lhan the occasional modest knocks of person coming to view the premises. Last week, alas ! I was roused from my dream of bliss by an awkward rat-lat-tat, and a sort of scuffle in the street, proceeding from a family coach wilh four posters, and six inside ; and a barouche and pair, full of ladies' maids. A marvellous explosion of scolding, squabbling, swearing, and unpacking, ensued ; and, within four-and-twenty hours of the great event, a piano was rattling in the back dining-room, \u2014 a harp twanging in the front drawing-room ; \u2014 Ihe under footman played the fiddle in the pantry, and three children and a teething infant were skirmishing and roaring in the nurseries; to say nothing of a never ceasing call for \" Jane\" or \" John\" upon Ihe staircase ; \u2014 two slaves of Ihering, whom I take tobe the housemaid and footman. \"Mr. and Mrs. Gresham Ronsham, of Wrangham Hall,\" are come lo town, it seems, for the season, to bring out three elder daugh ters, and bring up three younger ones ; and the stir and buslle of the whole family is little inferior to the confusion of Babel. Such double knocks, such single, such eternal ringing of bells and slammingof doors; such arrivals of band-boxes, \u2014 square, circular, oval, great, small, middling ; such a throng of hack cabriolets in attendance \u2014 coiffeurs, dancing-masters, Italian-masters; \u2014 such apolhecarial chariots for the teclhing baby \u2014 such compendious family-coaches with visitors for papa and mamma. Like all great country families, they are great givers of great dinners; and the savoury fumes of gravy soup rise lo my windows long before I rise to my breakfast. Decidedly the party-wall ofa London house ought, by act of parliament, to be Iwo bricks thicker. Three times a-week, one daughter has Signor Bravura and his solfeggio, wilh every day a three hours' practice ; I can even overhear John and Jane reprimanding Master Robert for sliding on Ihe balusters; and yesterday, Miss Maria had a visit from the dentist, attended with screams lhat caused my blood to stagnate. It is, in fact, surprising how much refilling and re-modelling is indispensable for poor people, who have been figuring wilh credit at Iheir country-seat, lo pass current in the crowd of London. Milliners, mantua-makers, stay-makers, shoe-makers, hosiers, glovers, jewellers, hair-dressers, are set in motion merely that three moderately well looking girls may pass an evening in society without incurring the charge of being quizzes. The parents worry themselves to death lo discover Ihe right way to do the right thing ; spend half-a-year's income in three months; kill their old butler, lame their favourite horses, break Iheir new carriage, lose their time and temper ; are cited by Ihe newspapers as having been present at some Caledonianor Hibernian ball; in May, as having arrived at their house in St. James's"], [205, "DfARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 29 Place, from Iheir seal in Lincolnshire; and in August, as having de parted from the same lo Ihe same; while, after all, one daughter mar ries the curate ofthe parish, and another, Ihe second son of a neighbour ing 'squire. Amongst the numerous offences committed against me by Herbert the other morning, was a formal invitation to dinner. Wilh perfect sincerity, I gave to him and Armine a general invitation to my house ; begging them only to send down to St. James's Place in the morning, whenever they had no belter engagement, in order to make sure lhat I dined at home. \"General invitations go for less than nothing, in my opinion,\" was his ungracious reply. \"In proof of which, / invite you to dine here on Saturday the fourteenth of May, to meet a pleasant party, and eat a detestable dinner.\" \" Invite my sisterto dinner ata week'sdate?\" interrupted Armine. \"On the contrary, pray ask her to dine wilh us, en famille, to morrow 1\" \" Our specimen of a breakfast, en famille, Ihis morning, proved, no doubt, very attractive?\" said Herbert. \"No, nol no family dinners for a sine lady like Mrs. Delaval, who cannot live without her Almack's and Merioneth House, and who keeps a cordon bleu of a chef, if I am to trust to Ihe low bow I saw bestowed on her carriage yesterday, from Crockford's window, by George Hanton. A family dinner! \u2014 boiled soles and shrimp sauce, a fat leg of mutton, and sallow potatoes, peeled with a knife! Faugh!\" And, in spite of all I could urge, he held me engaged lo dinner for the fourteenth. Now, though I should dearly like lo dine with Ihe Herberts alone, and chat wilh Armine after dinner, I have not the slightest inclination to derange them by preparations tor a party. I perfectly remember in my aunt Margaret's establishment, the general disarrangement produced by the occasional ceremony of giving a dinner; besides which, I have been forced by his peremptory proposal, to put off a weekly standing engagement to the Delavals; where, on Saturdays, a party of parliamentary men always assembles. But my penance was lo be; and, to-day, at seven o'clock, I drove to New- Norfolk Street. The moment I entered, I felt persuaded things would go wrong. The footman looked stiff and stupid in a new livery, as fine as yellow plush could make him ; and the butler, as sulky as a country butler always looks under the temporary subjection of a maitre d'hotel hired for Ihe day. Armine was not dressed when I arrived, and Herbert stood on the hearlh-rug, swearing al her dilatoriness, and the overpowering perfume of some jonquils and heliotropes, wilh which she had ornamented the jardiniere. His petlishness was soon silenced by the announcement of a Sir Dunstan Forbes, a lall, square-"], [206, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 30 shouldered, fussy man, loo huge of stature, and too loud of tone for so small a mansion; and, immediately afterwards, a thundering knock, and Armine hurried in, drawing on her gloves, just in lime to receive Sir John and Lady Farrington; the lady, dazzling in a full-trimmed lilac satin gown, diamonds, and a wreath of roses! The sun shone brightly upon our finery and ill-humour; and every time the door was opened, came a powerful whiff of the unwholesome vapour of charcoal. Two olher men dropped slowly in; but the remaining two, who were to make out our party of ten, not yet making their appear- ance, the children were asked for by Lady Farrington, a Bedfordshire neighbour of my sister, apparently well-versed in her family concerns. Herbert interposed his interdiction, saying, that children before dinner were a bore. Armine looked nervous \u2014 Lady Farrington pleaded wilh affected earnestness; and, after ten minutes' disputing, Ihe nursery bell was rung, \u2014 the children, evidently waiting the summons, in all their company finery arrived, and set up a quartett of roaring, or rather a glee \u2014 for Monlresor, the eldest boy, ran boldly in and climbed on Lady Farrington's lilac salin knees; while poor dear Armine after vainly endeavouring to pacify them, and eke the head nurse, who bridled with suppressed indignation, on hearing her master assert, lhat they were the worst managed brats in England, sentenced them lo return to Ihe place from whence they came. Herbert, looking al his watch, proclaimed that it was half-past seven, and talked of ordering dinner. Armine pleaded that Lord Lancaster was always late ; and that, from Spring Gardens to New Norfolk Street was a vast distance for Lord Hampton. The Album was accordingly re-opened, and re-admired by those nearest the table; the \" Keepsake,\" and the \" Book of Beauty,\" were commented upon, according to in dividual tastes; and Sir Dunstan inquired of Sir John, whether he had been late at Ihe house the preceding night, in order to prove to the two silent gentlemen in black, that they were in presence of honourable members. Again there came a pause ; and Sir Dunslan attacked Lady Farring ton on the exhibition at Somerset House ; he giving as his own Ihe sturdy criticisms ofthe Athen\u00e6um, and she replying in the flimsy of the Court Magazine. Hebert was growing flushed, when a carriage rallied lo the door, and in came Lord Hampton, all bustle, fuss, and apology, affecling lo pant for breath ; shaking hands to the right and left, wilh the empressemcut of a man who arrives loo late ; bowing im pertinently low to the two strangers, as if to announce himself most affably resigned to make the acquaintance of the whole injured com pany. \"I have a thousand apologies to offer lo Mrs. Herbert,\" spluttered his lordship, in an audible voice to her husband. \" But the fact is, I"], [207, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 31 uniformly dine at eight ; and being fully persuaded that you had in vited me at eight, I desired Francois to have my things ready for me at Ihe usual hour. I was sauntering leisurely near the Mount Gate, at twenty minutes after seven, when, happening to meet Lancaster, he said, 'I thought you were to dine at Herbert's?' adding something about an early dinner, which absolutely startled me. He observed thai you were very considerate to dine at such an hour, in order lo enable us to see something of the Norma. Believe me, I was horror struck 1 \u2014 took but three minutes anda quarter lo reach Spring Gardens, \u2014 searched for your card \u2014 found il \u2014 gave myself five minutes to dress \u2014 waited only while my horses were putting lo, and have now nothing left but to Ihrow myself on Mrs. Herbert's good-nature.\" This aplogy, which apology was none, was received wilh indulgence ; and the party, yawning and hungry, satisfied that Lord Lancaster in tended to cut Ihe affair altogether, fell upon him like cannibals, and were tearing him to pieces, when in he sauntered, \u2014 cool, undaunted, unapologizing, \u2014 bowing slightly to his hosts, saluting Lord Hamplcn with a glance, and totally unconscious of the presence of any other person. A dead silence ensued ; during which he glided across the room to make the inquiry d'ttsuge of my sister. \"Have you been out this morning? \u2014 Lovely day ! \u2014 exquisite weather!\" while we all waited impatiently the announcement of dinner. But, as it may usually be observed in such cases, the dinner that has been kept wail ing, in the end causes others lo wait; and more than a quarter of .in hour elapsed before we found ourselves wedging our way down to t):e dining-room, while little Horace Herbert was roaring his up to the nursery. I heard his father making goodnatured remarks to Lady Farrington, who was leaning on his arm; while I followed, on lhat tf Lord Hampton, into a dining-room overheated with Carcel lamps, lighted and smoking for the lasl two hours. In Ihe act of sending away his scarcely tasted soup, Lord Lancaster, affecting to perceive me, made me a forma! beud of recognition, while I swallowed in uneasy silence my cold turbot and warm cucumber. At three out of every six of even tho best dinners given in London, the company is ill-assorted, and the party dull. But, when damped by a really indifferent dinner, nothing can be more unsocial than such a meeting. Sir John and Lady Farrington talked Bedfordshire with Armine and Herbert, which, lo all the rest of the party was Hebrew and Greek; Lancaster and Hampton talked club to each other across the table, \u2014 a dialect equally mysterious to the uninitiated; the two silent gentlemen grew absolutely dumb during the process of mastica tion; and Sir Dunstan, by whom I was sealed, bored me by a series of fretful animadversions on the evils of Ihe age, \u2014 abusing the post office, \u2014 reform-bill, \u2014 macadamization, \u2014 public places, \u2014 private so-"], [208, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 32 ciety, \u2014 men and filings, \u2014 women and books ; and at every new topic of dissertation, ending by protesting that if the thing went on, he would certainly write a leiter to Ihe Times. \"Any news from Hollybridge?\" inquired Sir John, addressingmy brother-in-law. \" Nothing important. I had a letter from Thorns yesterday. They want rain. By the way, Thorns mentioned lhat Denis (Lord Force fig's head-keeper) had been over to our friend Smith, about a war rant for the people in Broomby Bottom. It seems they have now some grounds to go upon, Still I hope Smith will be cautious. Smith is apt lo let his sportsmanlike feelings run away wilh him. That affair about the Oakley keepers did him a great deal of injury in the county. I trust Smith will be cautious.\" \" Did Thorns say, whether anything was settled about slating the almshouses at Dudley? My man Robson was up last week on busi ness at Smilhsieid ; and he told me, lhat at the last meeting nothing was decided; adding (between ourselves) that every thing in that quarter was likely lo remain at sixes and sevens til! we were back again. Smith is a sad potterer, unless on matters connected wilh the sporting interest.\" \" Were you late last night?\" inquired Lord Lancaster of Lord Hampton, in a cross fire. \" About three 1 I stayed out another rubber. \" \" It was going hard against you when I left. The admiral was gelling fussy. I heard him call for a glass of Madeira.\" \" He lost sixteen points of sive; and Ihe night before, a couple of hundred against Hillon.\" \" He had belter pull up. The admiral's play is worse than any thing, except his luck.\" \" Have you heard lhat he has promised to put up Traffrail ?\" \" He had belter let it alone. Traffrail was with our squadron at Cherbourg last summer. We know him. It won't do.\" \" He was black-balled three times last winter at Paris.\" \" That argues nothing. The Carlist clique black-ball all the Eng lish upon principle. They have thrown over some of the best fellows in town ; and show no mercy to younger brothers like Traffrail. A low bow from Rothschild would have been his only guarantee.\" \"You were at the Opera, madam, on Saturday?\" said Sir Dun stan, addressing me, meanwhile, wilh stalely condescension ;\u2014 to which inquiry I bowed an affirmative. \" In that case, I trust you partici pated in the indignation I could scarcely repress at finding the last act of the Gazza Ladra substituted for tho first act of the Semir amide.

I fairly warn Monsieur La porte, that, should he again presume to trifle in a similar manner with the forbearance of his subscribers, I will write a letter to the Times.\" And this is rational conversation ! \u2014 Heigho ! heigho ! heigho ! \u2014 Miss Austin observes, in one of the best of her admirable novels, that \" when lovely woman stoops to be disagreeable,\" the only art her guilt to cover is, like the lovely woman who sloops to folly, \" to die'\" Yet, what multitudes stoop lo be disagreeable 1 \u2014 How many of those who are sulking wilh the world, from finding themselves less impor tant, less beautiful, less lauded than they could wish, lake refuge in the morasses of disagreeableness ! \u2014 some looking prudish \u2014 some con sequential \u2014 some pharisaical \u2014 some blue, \u2014 in the mistaken view of magnifying their nothingness. So that their presence do but impose upon the limid, the ignorant, and the weak, they are content. They forget lhat the world repays itself during their absence ; \u2014 lhat they must sometimes depart this city, and, at last, this life ; and that, if the ass avenged itself by spurning the dead lion, still more ignominiously are its hoofs applied upon a defunct asinine brother, equipped in a lion's skin ! Last night, at Mrs. Percy's, \" Sare Delafals\" brought in tidings, that Lady Kirkby was no more ! Lady Kirkby, it seems, was once a beauty and a wit, \u2014 an heiress in her youth, a countess in her middle age. Yet she lived without a friend, and died without a mourner; for sAe.alas ! had stooped to be disagreeable. As a beauty, she was envious; as a wit, spiteful ; as an heiress, selfish ; as a countess, insolent. To secure her supremacy in the fashionable world, she had dropped her own relations ; and at length, infirm and wrinkled before her time, by incessant wear and tear of temper, the world made mouths at her dis tresses. Her daughters disappointed her, by remaining single ; her sons thwarted her inclination, by marrying according to theirs. Vexed by her own family, she looked abroad for consolation ; hired a profes sional toady, and gathered a whole batch oi protegees under her wings. But even Toady and the Protected at last rebelled. Lady Kirkby's friendship was dreaded almost as much as her animosity ; she harassed her allies scarcely less than her enemies. She was fine, she was ner yous, she was susceptible, \u2014 she was, in short, eminently disagreeable; and now lhat she is dead and gone, the two thousand tongues, so long kept still, per force of Terror, are wagging against her, as if to make up for loss of time. Warning! warning ! warning! To-morrow there is a Drawing-room, at which I am lo be presented by the Marchioness of Clackmannan. I waited till Armine's arrival 3"], [210, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 34 in town, hoping that Herbert would permit her to accompany me; but he protests, that poor men's wives have no business at Court; and Armine, with her usual gentle habit of accepting his opinions, assures me she is afraid of the heat. A female Court must certainly be highly advantageous to Ihe in terests of commerce. What an infinity of trivialities must be accom plished, in order to send one in good style to the drawing-room. My neighbours, the Ronshams, seem in a panic of agitation. The old horses have been crammed with beans; the old coach (and coachman, too, I fancy) re-varnished ; Ihe old hammercloth re-fringed, \u2014 seeing that Ihere was no time for more extensive preparations, and while waiting, this morning, full-dressed in my white satin and plumes, the summons of Lady Clackmannan, I had the amusement of seeing the Mamma Ronsham in pompadour and gold, looped up here, and flounced down there, bundled inlo Ihe carriage, by her spouse, in his yeomanry uniform, looking vastly like Major Sturgeon; while Ihe young ladies followed, in pink and silver, their elbows red by nature, \u2014 their ears and noses, by the effort of bringing-to the hooks and eyes of ill-fitting gowns. Better have powdered them after the fashion of their two bedizened foolmen, whose heads exhibited a bushel of flour, \u2014 whose canes exceeded, in length, the djereed of a Persian warrior, \u2014 and whose bouquets must have deprived Covent Garden of its last polyan thus. After all, magnificence is a tawdry thing, when viewed under the searching blaze of sunshine. Jewels lack lustre, \u2014 gold appears mere tinsel, \u2014 the circumslanlialilies of dress are loo much seen lo admit of any general effect ; and even beauty's self becomes less beautiful. The exposure of the person imparts a meretricious air, \u2014 the complexion becomes moistened by the sliding atmosphere of the crowded rooms. As to ladies of a certain age, let them, above all things, avoid the drawing-room: \u2014 such a revelation of wrinkles, moles, beards, rouge, pearl-powder, pencilled eye-brows, false hair, and false teeth, as were brought to light, I could scarcely have imagined. Many faces, which I had thought lovely at Almack's, grew hideous when exposed lo the tell-tale brighlness of Ihe meridian sun ; Ihe consciousness of which degeneration rendered them anxious, fretful, and doubly frightful. Two or three dowagers, with moulhs full of gold wire, chinstays of blond to conceal their withered deficiencies, and tulle illusion tippets, were really horrific; paiuted sepulchres,\u2014 ghastly satires upon the hollowness of human splendour. In general, the men suffered less by exposure lhan the women. In these limes, so many uniforms are worn, and a well-padded, well buckramed uniform goes so far towards the manufacture of a manly looking man, that I had no fault to sind, except wilh a few quizzes."], [211, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 35 much resembling lhat model for courtiers, \u2014 Lord Grizzle, in Tom Thumb. Mr. Penrhyn had a certain faux air of Sir Charles Grandi son, which rather took my fancy; and young Clarence Delaval in the hussar dress of the Duke of Merioneth's yeomanry cavalry, was really perfect. Lady Alicia and Clarence would make a charming couple ! A more charming couple still were Sir Robert and Lady Mardyn ville, \u2014 so fussy about arriving in lime, and having their names legibly written, and getting forward before their Majesties were too tired to distinguish them, and being prominently noticed by every member of the Royal Family. I stood near them, after we had passed the Presence Chamber; and they would not let me off a single bow. \" His Majesty observed to me, wiLh the greatest condescension, ' Sir Robert, I am glad to see you ;' and the Queen inquired, most affably, of Lady Mardynville, after our young people. The Duke of Cumberland, as you may have noticed, nodded to me as I passed him, \u2014 the Duke of Sussex bowed. The Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria smiled; as much as to say, 'Ah! Sir Robert and Lady Mardynville,' and Princess Augusta inquired of her ladyship how long wo had been in town. Princess Sophia, of Gloucester, treats us quite as friends ; Lady Mardynville has a private audience of her royal highness once or twice in the course of the season. In short, it is not every one who can boast of being received as we have been. There is some satisfaction in paying our respects to the royal family, when we know, that our absence would be noticed, and that our attendance is appreciated.\" For my part I was too much confused during my presentation to take much heed of what had occurred ; not on account of the examina tion ofthe royal family, who exhibit the graciousness and indulgence of high-breeding ; but because the malicious face of Lady Lancaster was prying from behind the Queen ; while her son, who was in waiting, stared me out of countenance. His supercilious nonchalance was quite as insupportable as while enduring the martyrdom of the bad dinner in New Norfolk Street. Having no claim to aspire to the hospitalities of the King and Queen, I have only to regard Ihe drawing-room as one of the best parties in town; and though, of necessity, far from a select assemblage, com prehending more lhan any other the nobility and opulence of the kingdom. Many attend, out of respect for the throne; many more, out of respect to Iheir own position in society ; and Ihe remainder, perhaps, to exhibit iheir diamond necklaces and state liveries. I have often heard it asserted lhat an English girl, wilh the early bloom of girlishness on her cheek, is the prettiest creature in the world; and have thence concluded that a drawing-room, where so 3\""], [212, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 36 many of these rosebuds are brought forward to exhibit their first ex pansion, must present a most interesting spectacle. This morning I particularly noticed (he demoiselles to be presented ; and the ghastliness of the ladies of a certain age was scarcely less repulsive lhan the niaiserie of several of these budding beauties. Nothing but a young calf is so awkward as a girl fresh from the school-room, with the ex hortations ofthe governess against forwardness and conceit still echoing in her ears ; knowing no one,\u2014 understanding nothing,\u2014 afraid to sit, to stand, to speak, to look,\u2014 always in a nervous ague of self-misgiving. The blushing, terrified, clumsy girls, I noticed yesterday, will soon refine into elegant women ; but what will then become of the delicacy of their complexion and the simplicity of their demeanour? I am not one of those who cannot dispense with the case-hardened air of fashion, which strips the cheek of its blushes, and the eyelid of its downcast veiling. The durete of expression produced by long ex posure to the stare of society, the worldliness stamped upon the brow, are, to me, fearful indications ; and one of the charms which dis- tinguishes my cousin, Lady Cecilia, from those of her caste, is a peculiar, whimsical, playful, un-na'ive naivete, incompatible with the defying air of what is called Fashion. And what, after all, is called Fashion ? Ten thousand various things, by ten thousand various people ! Rank is positive, wealth positive ; but Fashion is an airy nothing, which obtains a name and local habitation, according lo the fancy of the tribunal sitting in judg- ment. Provincial people, speaking of their county races, observe, \" We had all the fashion of the neighbourhood : the duchess and her daughters, Lord So and So and his sons ;\" evidently mistaking mere nobility for fashion. London people, of the second class, talk in the same strain, of \" having met Mrs. Bullion and Mrs. Omnium,\" or other notabilities ofthe Bank-stock aristocracy with quantities of their fashionable friends at Hastings or Brighton.\" While the world, \u2014 the peremptory world of Ihe two thousand, applies the designation of fashion exclusively to that precarious and uncertain distinction which, for a moment, concentrates the savour of its caste upon certain things, or certain persons ; individuals deficient in birth, fortune, morals, and understanding, have sometimes been eminently the fashion ; and, as 6uch, preferred before the great or good ; have been invited every- where, courted, caressed, till they attained an air of self-possession,\u2014 of satisfaction in themselves and the world, \u2014 conventionally termed an air of fashion. Nothing, however, is so unaccountable as the generation and pro gress of this gaseous vapour ! Like the malaria or the cholera, it ragelh where it listeth ; and whether infectious, or contagious, orspon-"], [213, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 37 taneous, or what not, no man can tell. It is as little to be commanded or controlled as the winds of heaven ; and is more talked about, and as little understood, as political economy, or the metempsychosis. A curious example was afforded me the other night, by Lady Cecilia, of the capricious nature of this butterfly goddess, whose frivo lous worship seems to form the darling idolatry of London. Opposite to us, at the opera, but on a higher tier, is a small and inconvenient box, in which I have been accustomed to notice the comings and goings of all the \"fashionable\" men about town ; that is, the men of rank and fortune, distinguished, furthermore, by the ennobling touch of the tinsel wand. One crimson curtain of the box is always just sufficiently advanced to conceal the person seated behind its folds ; and, had it not been for the occasional extension of an arm with an exquisitely silting white glove, beating time with a glittering fan, I might have been per mitted to surmise, that a bishop, or a lord chancellor, enjoyed slily, in lhat recondite retreat, the terrestrial harmonies of Mozart or Rossini. But, its inmate thus proved to be a woman, I had only to conclude lhat she was one of those more sinning than sinned against, concern ing whom questions must not be asked by lips polite. Last Saturday, however, I was startled by Lady Cecilia's observa tion of, \" Ah ! Mrs. Crowhurst is in the duke's box, I see, which explains why her little boudoir of fashion, yonder, is deserted to night.\" \"Mrs. Crowhurst?\" said I; and, following the direction of her glass to the ducal box to which she alluded, I found it fixed upon a tall, fair, handsome, and strikingly \" fashionable-looking\" woman. \" How abominable of the duke, whose sisters and cousins are often seen in that box, to allow such a person to enter it 1\" I exclaimed, in a fit of virtuous indignation. \" Such a person ?\" \" Such a person as that Mrs. Crowhurst.\" \" My dear love, she is not that Mrs. Crowhurst ; she is the Mrs. Crowhurst. What have you to urge against her ?\" \" Nothing ! for, till this moment, I never heard her name ; but I have always concluded \" \" Fie, fie ! where have you lived, my dear, not to have heard of Mrs. Crowhurst?\" \" Seven years at Delaval Castle, and seventeen in a cottage in Staf fordshire, since you oblige me to plead my cause,\" said I, laughing. \" But, instead of deriding, pray, enlighten my ignorance.\" \"And you really never heard of Mrs. Crowhurst ! Vous etes d'une ignorance crasse, as the French say of those who know twice as much as themselves ! Mrs. Crowhurst is, as you see, a handsome woman ; she is, as the peerage will tell you, well born ; and, as I can"], [214, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 38 tell you, clever and agreeable. Yet, when she first descended upon this most capricious of cilies, no one cared for her \u2014 she did not get on\u2014 she was not the fashion. Some thought her too lall, some too fair\u2014 some too lively\u2014 some too frivolous\u2014 all too something. Almack's turned up its nose at her ; and, under such contumelious treatment, most women, ejected from the highest sphere, would have taken to starring it in a lower. But the Crowhurst (let us do her justice !) had a taste for good society ;and, after secretly analyzing the nature of the supercilious men and women by whom she was judged unworthy notice, determined on a coup d'etat. She made herself talked about, grew af fected, lost her character, and\u2014 became Ihe fashion ! I, and other fools, immediately set about inquiring, ' IVho is this Mrs. Crowhurst, con cerning whom there is such a scandal with Lord Alfred? Not the Mrs. Crowhurst I met down at Clackmannan Court?\u2014 Well ! I had not Ihe least ideathere was any thing attractive in lhat woman !' \u2014 and so began to discover merits in her errors. By degrees she became the rage; nay, she is still the height of the fashion. But if all the world believed her, as 1 do, to be, in reality, well-conducted, it would be puzzled to assign any motive for her sudden popularity.\" \" You are giving me a terrible lesson,\" said I, laughing. \"What a frightful road to fashionable savour!\" \"By no means! Your position and hers are essentially different. Were a breath of scandal to blow upon you, you were lost. You, free, independent, able to marry where you please, have no possible apo logy for indiscretion. Even flirting is forbidden to a widow. That which passes for flirtation in a girl of seventeen, becomes coquetry in a belle veuve ; and should she raise expectations which she afterwards refuses to gratify with her hand, she is termed, in plainest English, a jilt; \u2014 for she must have coquetted wilh malice prepense. You, my dear cousin, my dear friend, must take some wiser mode of becoming the fashion; luckily, you have only V embarras du choix.\" I was pleased by Cecilia's little lesson, for I saw she was in earnest. With all her le'gerete, it would deeply grieve her, were my conduct to provoke a disparaging comment. Towards her niece, Lady Alicia, she maintains the same severity; and, in presence of our lovely young fiiend, is twice as guarded in every sentiment and expression as in con versing wilh others. Had she been blest wilh daughters of her own, I am persuaded they would have been admirably educated ( i. e. for women of fashion )! It is a mistaken prejudice which decides a man against marriage with the daughter ofone whose early years are sup posed to have been years of error. Such a woman is rigorous, above all others, in watchfulness over her child; whereas women like Lady Clackmannan, whose conduct through life has been irieprochable, and who have basked in the sunny side of society, are apt lo fancy virtue a"], [215, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 39 thing of descent, or matter of course, leaving it to be inculcated by the governess, wilh geography and the use of the globes. \u2014 Interrupted by a tiresome morning visit 1 How could even a woman so misjudging as Lady Farrington imagine lhat, because, at Armine's desire, I sent her my card, I entertained any desire to listen to her more prosaic prose for three long quarters of au hour! For the sirst ten minutes of her visit, I was deceived into thinking her charming; for she talked only of my sister, and of my sister only wilh praise. \" As dear Mrs. Herbert's nearest neighbour in the country, she had such opportunities of admiring her sweetness of temper, her deplh of judgment, her softness of disposition ! Mrs. Herbert was her standard of perfection. She knew not such a wife, such a mother, such a mistress, such a friend. No one could properly estimate Mrs. Herbert but those who resided in her own neighbourhood, and saw her, young and pretty as she was, devote her lime lo clothe the hungry and feed the naked \u2014 (she begged my pardon, she me.int clothe the naked and feed the hungry) \u2014 could do justice to her virtues. Nothing so unselfish, nothing so amiable as Mrs. Herbert!\" Must I not have had a heart of adamant to resist Ihis well-merited eulogy of my dear sister? I began to discover that, if not an elegant, Lady Farrington was a warm-hearted, sensible woman. What mat tered her over-fine gown and tawdry bonnet, since she knew how to render justice to Armine ! But a falling off soon followed. \" She had so long wished to make my acquaintance? Mrs. Herbert had talked me over with her so often ; she seemed to know me as well, and to be as au fait of my affairs, as if we had been friends from child hood. She knew, in fact, more of me than I could suppose.\" And in uttering the hint, she assumed a significant smile, which, were I less acquainted with my sister's delicacy, would have led me to sup pose lhat Armine had really been betraying my confidences to a stranger ! But Lady Farrington soon disclosed herself. Perceiving how fa vourable an impression she had made by her rhapsodies concerning \" dear Mrs. Herbert,\" she proceeded to panegyrize the husband wilh equal fervour. \" She did not know what they should do in Bedford shire without dear Mr. Herbert : Mr. Herbert was such a good neigh bour, such an agreeable companion, such an active magistrate, such a sensible man; \u2014 such an excellent husband, such a kind father, such a valuable friend, such an indulgent landlord, such a liberal patron.

Luckily, she came prepared to eulogize all and sundry unto myself appertaining ; and having now praised my sister, her hus band, and children, my house, my furniture, and even Azim, who was dozing on the rug, she considered my very neighbours entitled to their share of commendation. \"She had the pleasure of knowing the Gresham Ronshams;\u2014 charming family,\u2014 so agreeable, so accomplished, so much people of the world !

But they heard me singing, through the wall, and heard my little dog bark, and often fancied they could even distinguish my voice. Then they saw me go out in the carriage (theywere quite in love w ilh my carriage !) and come home on horse back (the girls thought my mare the handsomest in London). In short, they were extremely interested in all my pursuits !\" I had no lime to retort upon my neighbours; for, just then, Mr. Penrhyn made his appearance; and I have no doubt Lady Farrington has by this time called upon the Herberts, to ascerlain the name of the tall, dark gentleman, so very intimate with dear Mrs. Delaval, that even her lapdog jumps on his knees without invitation!

Epsom,\u2014 balls,\u2014 two delightful dinners, and apelitsouper at Merioneth House last night, after the opera ; yet, to-day, to borrow the comparison of Beatrice, I am as dull as a great thaw. The truth is, that the society of Lady Clackmannan and her daughter is exlremely wearying ; the former, because she excites one loo much, \u2014 the lalter, too little. Lady Clackmannan is full of sire and intelligence ; subdued, indeed, by the high breeding of exclusivism; but your attention is not kept the less painfully on Ihe strelch, because her eloquence is couched in a voice as low in tone as one of Bregu'e'l's dumb repeaters ; nor does her glittering eye hold you less potently enthralled, because it is one that sixes only her intimates, and never wanders over the crowd. To pass a day wilh her is looking on a piece of intricate clock-work; you feel sure lhat, while Ihe automaton performs ils functions with measure and deliberation, wheel within wheel, and flyer upon flyer, are labour ing prestissimo wilhin. As to Lady Alicia, her childish simplicity isa perpetual gathering of primroses \u2014 an insipid scentless flower, not worth stooping for! I wonder who was the rather sallow-looking, silent, but certainly distinguished man whom George Hanlon brought wilh him to help us through our sandwiches at Epsom, and whom Lady Clackmannan ap peared so anxious lo engross? While she engaged him in an eager conversalion on her side Ihe carriage, Hanton whispered lo me, wilh a glance at our small silver sandwich-box and boille of sherry, \" If one were not afraid to be seen in their society, there are people to be found at Epsom, who, instead of coming to see their bets decided, wilh a sandwich or two in the carriage, lo avoid being too hungry for dinner, make a regular parly of pleasure of Ihe Derby, and bring down huge baskets from Gunter's ; \u2014 pate's de volaille and iced champagne, \u2014 quite a diner de campagne. To see them gormandizing in some of the car riages, you would suppose a famine at hand. I am convinced certain persons come to Epsom only to eat!\" \u2014 And, having swallowed Ihe re maining anchovy sandwich in the box, away went Mr. Hanton; and I actually saw him afterwards talking lo the Ronsham Greshams, and de vouringa plateful of tongue and chicken on tire step of Ihe family coach.

Then so many pretty dresses\u2014 so many pretty women, combined with fresh air, sunshine, and the sudden outburst into Ihe country from the thral dom of town, render the day of the Derby an universal fete.

Above all, the rare assemblage of fine horses, which start wilh the fine gentlemen (placing the fine gentle men, in sporting term, second), to meet the running horses atTollenham Corner! Altogether, what an air of prosperity, \u2014 what excess of luxury, \u2014 and what a contrast lo the stale of things I have, of late years, been compelled to witness! Yet, if the truth were told, there is six times as much spirit of enjoyment in the ragged regiment of spectators, gracing similar scenes, in Ireland ; and if they sometimes close in strife and disorder, it is that the contrast afforded by such rare occasions of diversion to Ihe humiliations of daily life, proves too exciting for the reason of the unreasoning. I wonder whether foreigners are as much impressed as I was by the coup d'\u0153il of the Epsom course. No olher occasion presents the English populace (aristocratic and plebeian) to their view, under so vivacious an aspect ; thrice vivacious lo me, who, for so many years, have inhabited a half-populated district, and written myself down, an ennuyee. It was odd enough, by the way, that Lady Clackmannan should not introduce to me her sallow friend ; for she has been kind enough to present me to her whole acquaintance. But this one man, whom, by her manner of addressing him, she evidently values, she keeps to herself. I saw him again, for a moment, at Lady Bruce's ball, look ing, as before, dry and discontented, though courted by all the finest of the fine ladies ; and he was opposite lo me at supper at Merioneth House, where it wag impossible to inquire his name, as he must have overheard the question. Lady Maria De Rawdou sat next him, flirting in her usual detestable style ; and I fancied he looked as disgusted with /.eras unconscious of me. Why should one feel offended when a stranger passes several hours in close propinquity, without honouring one wilh a smile, a word, or even a look? Those were good old fashioned times when people had an excuse for at least a civil gesture to Iheir neighbours at table, in helping the dish before them, or in viting them to take wine. Sir Jenison Delaval, who has just called, cannot assist my conjectures concerning Lady Clackmannan's sallow friend. He certainly is one of the stupidest and most unobservant men in Europe! He asked me as many questions about the Derby as if he had not read a dozen different accounts of the race in the news-papers ; whereas, /saw no more of the running, than if I had passed Ihe day in the vaults of"], [220, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 44 St. Faith's. We arrived late, got a bad place ; and I am not sports woman enough to climb to a barouche-box, and grill myself an hour in the sun, for the enjoyment of so brief a pleasure. Mrs. Crowhurst, by the way, was seated, outshining Ph\u0153bus, on the highest box of a carriage, on the least prominent place of which I should have been sorry lo be seen. But Ihis supper, \u2014 I cannot dismiss from my mind Ihe supper at Merioneth House. The duke was in high spirits, and eminently agree able ; my little crooked friend, Lady William Balely, gayer and more brilliant than I ever saw her, fully meriting her lille of La Lucciola ; and every one in his best mood and temper, except the strange man. It is one of the happy privileges of persons so great as the Duke of M , that they never see people out of humour, or flowers out of bloom. The gardener takes care lhat the plants exhibited in their con servatory shall be in fullest blossom ; and the guests who come to ad mire them, spread their butterfly-wings, and display their brightest colours, that they may be invited, again and again, to adorn Ihe savoured spot. It almost puts me out of patience, to hear people, like his grace, observe, when some woman is spoken of as capricious, or man as un certain, \" Well, really, I think you are unjust; Ihaveknownhermany years, and have never experienced, from her, any thing the least like ca price\" \u2014 or, \" Uncertain? I have uniformly found him one of the most agreeable, obliging persons of my acquaintance !\" Of his acquaintance, very probably; but in society less imposing, the claws of pussy's satin paws peep out. By the way, I did observe a little betrayal of temper, even at Me rioneth House, the other night. We have got a beautiful Piedmontese countess, a Madame di Campo Fiorito, lately arrived from the Con tinent ; exquisitely lovely, exquisitely fascinating, et qui fait fureur. All we know of her, at present, is, lhat she is high born and beautiful. Whether mischievous or not, no one can sav ; and it is amusing to ob serve the misgivings excited, in certain circles, by her debut. The established beauties are, for the moment, thrown into the shade, more especially those on the shady side of noon ; for the Campo Fiorito, in her twenty-first year, is delicate of complexion as a blush-rose, and can presume to be singularly simple in her style of dress : no trimmings, no ornaments, no flowers, no jewels \u2014 nothing but a plain robe of rich materials \u2014 nothing but her sine dark hair. Rouge and frippery are sadly put to the blush by such a contrast. Half a dozen women, whom, last week, I thought charming, seem lo have acquired a mere tricious air since the countess's arrival. Many look ugly, many old, \u2014 all tawdry. Is such a rival lo be pardoned ? The panic is considerably augmented by general uncertainty as to her conduct and intentions. Is she a flirt, a coquette, or worse?"], [221, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 45 Impossible to guess. Some tremble for their lovers, some for their husbands, some for their sons. Lady This declares, that nothing is so great an interruption to society as the presence of a professed beauty. Lady That, who, for years past, has been a professed beauty herself, has taken refuge, within the lasl week, in the pleasures of domestic life, parading in Kensington Gardens, with a group of her interesting children. Lady Clackmannan, who cannot forgive her for having eclipsed Lady Alicia, says, she has a melodramatic air. Lady Cecilia, who attempts Ihe bel esprit, when defeated as a 6e//e, says, she is a magnificent automaton, well wound up ; while others protest, she is admirably got up as a \"Keepsake\" heroine. This supper at Merioneth House was, I suspect, given in her honour. The duke, who likes every thing beautiful or clever, is prepossessed in her savour, and wishes to place her on a good sooting with her rivals. But not a charmer of them all was to be conciliated. In stead of exerting themselves to overpower the enemy, they sulked, and threw the game into her hands. Some, eager to seem unconscious of her presence, contrived only to look supercilious ; others talked ai her, and, consequently, flippantly and affectedly ; while several had a bad headach (the migraine of an angry Frenchwoman) and could not, or would not, open their lips. I fancy even Ihe good-natured duke might have admitted, on this occasion, that he had seen certain of his fair friends out of humour. I observed Lady Clackmannan in quire, of her nameless neighbour, as we rose from table, what he thought of the countess; to which ho replied, with an air of indif ference, that he had known her, some years ago, at Genoa. \" Apparently you do not admire her so much as the rest of the world ?\" persisted Lady C. \"On the contrary,\" he replied, \" I have long considered her Ihe most beautiful woman of my acquaintance ; but I am not easily infa tuated by a woman merely beautiful.\" It is curious enough, that, with all our proverbial coldness, no peo ple are subject lo such fever-fits of enthusiasm as the English, \u2014 fever sits much resembling the boiling-springs among the snows of Hccia.

Never was any woman so little calculated for a life of courliership. Absent, indolent, careless of appearances, the pomps and vanilies of life are, to her, absolutely incumbering; and when I ventured to ask her, in all the frankness of our boudoir tete-a-tete, whether she re gretted her appointment, she candidly answered in the affirmative. \"Nothing can be more amiable,\" said she, \"lhan those I have Ihe honour to serve ; nothing lighter lhan the duties I am required to per form.

Her ladyship threatens to with draw her custom and patronage, unless justice is done upon the stupid young person who thought proper to take her orders ; and floods of tears are drawn down the fair cheeks of the poor apprentice, who has an aged mother dependent for bread upon her salary, because Lord"], [224, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 48 Charles happened to pass LadyTheodolinda in the crush-room with out notice, owing (as she supposes) lo the frightful fall of that detest able feather. \" The great ladies have much lo answer for, madam, for their con duct towards us,\" said a good sort of motherly mantua-maker, wilh whom I once conversed on the subject. \" They come to us persist ing that they have not a gown to wear, that they shall be obliged to stay away from some dinner or ball, unless we send home a dress by a particular day and hour ; and the poor overtasked young women in my employ are, consequently, obliged to sit up another night, in ad dition lo the ten or twelve they have been passing without rest \u2014 pale, wan, exhausted, and in danger of falling into consumption, for want of air, exercise, and sleep. But, when the dress is taken home, the first thing that strikes the eye of the heartsick apprentice, in the lady's dressing-room is a choice of half a dozen gowns, silk, satin, lace, blue, pink, and white, laid out for selection ; many of them never worn. It is enough, madam, to make liars of our young people, when they find themselves so unjustly dealt with. Again,\" she resumed, finding me give ear lo her accusations, \" what a lesson for a simple-hearted young girl, such as the greater number of those apprenticed to me by respectable parents, \u2014 farmers or tradesmen, \u2014 to be introduced inlo the dressing-room of a fine lady, and pass half an hour wailing there, with the confidential maid ! Such discreditable secrets as she is likely to hear, such discreditable secrets to see ! \u2014 cosmetics, washes, paints; beautisications for the hair, teelh. eyebrows, complexion ; false ringlets, false braids, false pads for every part of Ihe figure ! And, from this abode of deceit and extravagance, strewed with billet-doux and un paid bills, I expect her to come home pure atid uncorrupted, to be industrious, frugal, and, above all, willing to forget her possession of those attractions which she has seen thus disgracefully counterfeited by one who happens to be born in a more prosperous condition of life than her own. Believe me, madam, a sad example is shown by our great ladies !\" I fear I did not bear this lecture in mind, when I proceeded on my bonnet-hunt this morning, but it was forcibly recalled to me at Howell and James's, where Lady Christina R , whom I never saw by day-light, except half-ridden in her vis-a-vis, with her face surrounded by blonde, was trying on a hat. As she turned to recover her bonnet from the table behind her, her face was fully revealed by broad day from the sky-light ; and the coating of rouge and pearl powder was disgusting. The white lead looked blue ; and the eyes, glazed wilh dissipation, seemed the only vital portion of the face. What a lesson ! what a degradation of the sex !"], [225, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 49 Nothing can be simpler than the dresses I have chosen for mysister and myself. Herbert will have no excuse for renewing his frequent charge against me of looking like La Reine de Golconde. Clarence Delaval honoured me, last night, by a confidence of his passion for his cousin Alicia, with which I could have well dispensed ; for I can be of no service to the young people, and shall greatly offend the old ones by even wishing them well. Clarence's prospects, poor fellow, are far from brilliant. Sir Jenison Delaval, who, being a va letudinarian, will water-gruelize himself to the age of eighty, having only four thousand a year, can make no great settlement on his son ; and though Clarence is next heir to Delaval Castle and the Irish pro perty, I have no desire lhat my good brother-in-law should make way for him. Lady Alicia has been brought up as delicately and luxuriously as becomes the only daughter of the house of Clackmannan, and is just fit to live in the heart of a rose, and be nourished on its perfume. It will not do ! 1 shall persuade Lady Cecilia to send Cla rence off to the Continent as soon as possible. This hurry-skurry of dissipation makes one very good-for-nothing ! Not a day nor an hour can I make my own, to devote to any useful purpose. All the world is talking of a wonderful speech on the poor laws, made by a wonderful Lord Hartson ; yet I have not been able to read a line of it. I must have met this Lord Hartson, for I have frequently heard his name pronounced in society ; but I cannot bring him to my recollection, unless it be a heavy doughy-looking man I found sitting one morning wilh Cecilia, clattering unintelligible political economy like a word-mill. I must read his speech, however, which, not being able to discuss argues oneself a dunce. It is surprising in how short a time the prevailing topic spreads from one end of London to the other; no influenza half so epidemic. The clubs, I fancy, are the great dispensers of gossip contagions ; but every day brings forth its tale of wonder\u2014 political, literary, theatrical, scandalous, or fashionable ; which, between the hours of six and eight, is discussed wilh fish and soup, and more or less of prose, in every house of credit and renown, from Hyde Park Corner to Russell Square. As to Lord Hartson's speech, he and his oratory have afforded a text for the last two days, for as much discussion as would fill the Bodleian library. If the man be in earnest, I honour him ; but so many of these soi-disant philanthropists select a subject ad captandum, that I must read, mark, and learn, before I give full faith to his honesty of purpose. To-night we are to have the new opera; and I have promised Lady Cecilia to be there, for the first coup d'archet. She is so much more susceptible than myself to the charms of music, that I have no right to disturb her ecstasies, by the opening and shutting of a door. My fair 4"], [226, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 50 cousin's nerves are wonderfully excitable. Reared in Ihe lap of luxury, as the spoiled pet of a fine lady, in a perfumed and overheated at- mosphere, she acquired a morbid sensibility of heart and heard, which her after-life was not fated to counteract. Excepting during the months passed wilh me at Delaval Castle, Lady Cecilia has never indulged in any but the most enervating habits ; till, at last, even her love of the aMs has become almost an hysterical passion. She has wrought herself up, for instance, to such a pitch of enthusiasm, concerning this new opera, that I have no doubt she will be obliged to tranquillize herself with \u00e6ther ; and I shall find her, to-night, salts-bottle in hand, her soul ready to be wafted upon a jig to heaven ! For my part, having been a diligent auditress at the last three re hearsals, my ardor is somewhat damped. What a mania for allend ing rehearsals prevails just now in London ! People seem to find strange delight in stumbling their way through dark, dusty passages into a darker, dustier box, which, by daylight, smells (like a pew at evening service in a damp country church) of serge curtains and straw matting, in order to hear a blundering orchestra tapped to order by a cross leader, or stormed into tune by a fiery prima donna ; to admire la Grisi in her bonnet and pelisse, or Rubini piping his falsetto, wilh his beaver not up, but on. Pour moi, je naime pas qu'on me de'sillu sionne! I could never weep again at Malibran's Desdemona, had I seen her rehearse it in a chintz gown, wilh Ihe primo violino out of tune, or out of sorts. Are not the French mistaken in Iheir notion, that Ihe English are peu impressionable? Have we not, on the contrary, of late years, borrowed their ready excitability ? I arrived, last night, before the first stroke of the overture ; yet every box was full : pit, gallery, pigeon-holes teeming wilh eager faces; nay, the very wanderers ofthe lobbies brought to a stand-slill, by a general compression : every inch of slanding-room occupied. Such a \"hush,\" too, as preceded Ihe preparatory flourish of the leader's bow ; a \"sh,\" as with the hissing of all the serpents of Tartarus ! Not a fan to be seen moving in Ihe house ; scarcely an eyebrow allowed to blink. I fell quite awe-struck by the responsibility of the composer (o such an audience; and was absolutely relieved by the thundering applauses thai followed a spirit ed and characteristic overture. Before the close of Ihe sirst act, of which no fewer lhan four morceaux were encored, I began lo be al most as nervous as Lady Cecilia ; not from Ihe effect of the music, but from the effect of the music on Ihe audience. WThen I saw the cheeks of others flushed with rapture, their eyes sparkling with delight, their hands hearing involuntary testimony to the emotion of their ecstalified feelings, I seemed to tremble at my own insensibility. These people evidently heard something in the tones of Grisi. which / wanled srnse"], [227, "DIARY OF A D__SENNUY__E. 51 to hear; and the more moving incidents of the second act, which, being familiar to we, I managed to .contemplate wilh tearless eyes, drew floods from those around me; ay, even \"iron tears down Pluto's cheek,\" by moistening the rouge of the dowager Duchess of Plymouth. Lady Cecilia was ashamed of my hardness of heart. She, poor soul, wept, and shuddered, and applauded ; and right glad was I of the ex cuse of going home to dress for a ball, to escape Ihe rhodomontade of criticism, which I knew would be poured forth by the visitors to our box, on the falling of the curtain. Leaving Ihe fanatici per la musica to weep away their harmonious agony, I hastened to my toilet, and arrived at Lady Bunlingford's, fresh and composed, just as the first conlredanse commenced ; when, to my amazement, I found numbers of those I had left at the opera, overpowered with emotion, smiling, flirting, chatting, en-avant-deu\u00e6 ing, without a trace of tears, or aromatic vinegar ; their trimmings and white gloves a little soiled, perhaps, by contact with the King's The atre, but every other impression wholly evaporated. The ball was a pleasant one to me, for I met Armine and her husband ; and, though sadly sneered at by Herbert, for the coquetry of having altered my dress after Ihe opera, I found him, on the whole, more agreeable lhan usual. Before Hvo o'clock however, they disappeared ; but I, being engaged to Lord Lancaster for a waltz, had courage to remain, and defy my brother-in-law's caustic comments on the want of dignity of those who wear a ball threadbare. In one of the pauses of the waltz, I discovered, among the bystanders, Lady Clackmannan's saturnine friend, looking scornfully upon our proceedings. Had I been dancing with any one but Lancaster, I should have inquired the name of the mysterious Mephistophiles. But I did not choose to appear interested by the mere appearance of any young man ; nor would I provoke Lord Lancaster's irony by my ignorance, if, as I imagine, my sallow despiser is one known lo all the world but myself. There was some thing in the coutemptuousness of his air as he stood considering my partner and myself, which my feminine spirit seemed roused to defy ; and when, on the conclusion of the waltz, Lord Lancaster tried to en gage me for the cotillon, for the first time in my life I complied. The cotillon is a dance which, in my conscience, I detest. Danced with spirit, it is a romping, unladylike exhibition ; danced with lameness, it is only vulgar and stupid, \u2014 the ordeal of a chaperon's patience, and a lover's magnanimity. I have, therefore, studiously avoided it; and ill-natured as it may seem, I form a disadvantageous opinion of the manners of girls, and the wisdom of their mammas, who are habitual stayers-out of a ball, and dancers of the cotillon. A widow, in such a position as mine, is, I am sure, one of the last persons to be involved in any such diversion ; yet I was actually sneered into standing up at 4*"], [228, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 52 Lad y Buntingsord's ball . I was glad when several exclamations of \"Ha, Mrs Delaval ! this is the sirst time I ever saw you dance Ihe cotillon ! mieux vaut tard que jamais !\" bore witness to my innocence; but (hey rendered me only the more conscious of the folly I was commit- ting, and, consequenlly, as awkward as I was uneasy. Slill my tormentor kept his ground. During the first three figures, there he stood,\u2014 his tall dignified person overlooking the circle,\u2014 about as stern, cold, and solemn, as Slonehenge ; nor was it till some of the romping figures commenced, and he saw me commence my round of impertinence with a crimson satin cushion in my hand, that his disgust reached the climax, and he stalked away. I could have cried to think what an idiot I was making of myself ; but apprehension of the world's dread laugh, combined with that of my supercilious partner, kept me in order. After all these vicissitudes, the pleasures of my day and night con cluded with a tremendous nightmare ; born, I believe, of unripe pine apple and indifferent champagne ; or, perhaps, who knows? an indif ferent conscience. I dreamed a dream which, alas ! needed no inter pretation. I fancied I was crossing, on a crazy raft, a small lake that lies on the Ballyshumna estate ; till by degrees the sheet of water nar rowed and narrowed into a foetid marshy dilch, on the banks of which stood a succession of horrid hovels, such as I have too often seen in the original ; from which proceeded howlingsand shriekings, as for a wake over the dead. So narrow was the dilch, that, every moment, the raft seemed to jar and wedge itself into the bank, when hundreds of noxious reptiles were startled from their hiding-places, and crawled for refuge into the water. At last, out of all patience wilh my self impelled steerage, I tried to climb the slimy, slippery bank, and ma naged to make my way lo one of the most dilapidated cabins ; from Ihe mouldering walls of which, repulsive sounds and smells were percep tible. Nevertheless, the evil genius of my dream compelled me to enter ; and there, stretched under horsecloths, round the naked cham ber, lay men, women, and children, purple wilh the typhus ; and in the midst, extended on the unhinged door of the hovel, the corpse ofa young woman, already \u2014 but no ! my pen cannot record such a com bination of horrors ! At length I seemed lo take courage, and tried to silence the howlings and lamentations around me ; when suddenly the figure of Lady Clackmannan's strange man, allired in long black garments, stood by my side, accosting me in the harshest tones and terms. \" Why do you reprehend these people ?\" he seemed to say. \" It is for you they are suffering ! It is to furnish plenty to your table that they are famishing ! The leavings of your lapdog would be dainties to sustain the strength of this dying family 1 Do the cries of their"], [229, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 53 anguish offend your delicate ears? They are tormented to afford you the means of languishing in an opera-box ! Do the exhalations of this den of wretchedness oppress you? Where would you find guineas to buy bouquets for your footmen, were not theseoutcasts taxed tosupplyyour jointure? Woman! woman! \u2014 A heavy account shall be demanded of you for this thing ! You shall answer before the Most High God for the sufferings of these nursing mothers, \u2014 of these young children ; and repay in sackcloth and ashes your profligate levity !\" Having roused myself at last with a painful gasp from this over powering dream, I could not help exclaiming with Lear, \" Oh ! I have ta'en too little care os this !\" I have written, this morning, to William Delaval, inclosing an order on my banker for the benefit of the poor on his estate ; for though 1 know him to be a liberal landlord, yet I, who draw so handsome a provision from Ihe property, ought to lake my share in ministering to the necessities of its population. We have all written and repeated till we are tired, that \"dreams arc the interludes of a busy fancy ;\" but are they not haply something more ? Do they not infer a benignant and protecting presence, in fluencing with terrors, or soothing wilh compassion? Be it indigestion, be it spiritual guardianship, I am the better for my nightmare of last night. It has given me food for meditation, not e'en to madness, but e'en to repentance. Seven o'clock. \u2014 Just returned frommy ride in Ihe park, out of spirits, or out of temper. Il is becoming too hoi to ride before dinner; but one's hours and habits in London are loo dependent on the whims of others, to admit of anything so rational as an early dinner, and a ride afterwards. To-morrow, however, 1 promise myself an early dinner. For the first time I am engaged to encounter the polite suffocation of the ventilator. There is to be an interesting debate ; and some good speaking is expected. Will those tiresome Mardynvilles ever let me alone ? They have sent me a card for another dinner ; and the Duke of Merioneth told me lo-day, in Ihe park, that they stopped their carriage to invite him (for they go out airing together like the king and queen of Brentford), on the plea of, \" to meet Mrs. Delaval,\" Taken by surprise, he ac cepted ; but I have already sent my excuse. What a mania with some people is the pride of improving their acquaintance ; or, properly speaking, adding names to their visiting list. The whole business of their life seems to consist, as in a game at commerce, in making up a hand of blazes ! Season after season, they toil lo convert esquires into baronets, baronets into lords, lords into viscounts, earls into marquesses, or dukes ! For peers, like crotchels, have their comparative value ; and,"], [230, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 54 as one semibreve is worth thirty-two demi-semiquavers, one duke covers at least a dozen baronets. I am constantly hearing it remarked, \"How wonderfully Ihe Mardynvilles have got on !\"\u2014 a phrase which, being interpreted, strictly means, \" What a wonderful number of their old acquaintance they have been enabled to cut!\" Three o'Clock, Saturday morning.\u2014 Row singular an adventure; how stupid and unobservant I must have been ! But here on paper, at least, let me collect my scattered thoughts, and commencer par le commencement. I was chaperoned in my political debut by no less a person than the far-famed Miss Randall, the bluest of blues, and most busy of busy-bodies, who scarcely misses a night in the ventilator throughout the session. She has her favourite nook, which no one but some miserable novice would think of usurping ; and the volumes of impure air she must have imbibed since politics came into fashion, sufficiently account for the pallor of her face, and the ardour of ils predominating feature. No \"blue\" had ever so red a nose, or so yellow a complexion, Wilh Miss Randal, accordingly, I ascended into the mysterious lan tern, whence we were to bend our ears to the eloquence of the House: and I had the vexation to find that we were late. Every corner was already silled with ladies as inquisitive as myself, with Ihe exception of Miss Randall's accustomed seat, and one (in the adjoining compart ment of which was a shabby-looking person in a black bonnet and cloak) on which lay a handkerchief, as if to mark that it was taken. As I paused opposite, however, the person in the cloak civilly removed the handkerchief, and stiffly informed me I was at liberty to occupy the place. I would willingly have refused, not being inclined tosettle in such close quarters wilh a neighbour so little distinguished ; but, having no choice but to accept or lose my last chance, I niched mvself in, and gave my attention to the business of the scene below. A very small portion of the House was discernible from my peephole ; but I was fortunate that it happened to include one of the ablest of the Tory speakers, who rose shortly after we entered the ventilator. It was my first opportunity (with the exception of an unimportant occasion at the Dublin University) of witnessing public oratory of any description ; and I own my impression was that of disappointment. Accustomed to connect such magnificent results with Ihe eloquence of the House of Commons, and to peruse such laboured but fluent speci mens of parliamentary speaking, I was quite startled by the poverty, the rawness, the insignificance, of the reality. Of the three first members it was my luck to hear, the manner was so detestable that the mailer hardly reached my comprehension ; and even in one pointed out by Fame and the cheers of the house as a most valuable member, I was shocked by the schoolboy awkwardness, the false emphasis, and"], [231, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 55 vulgar action, disfiguring what I might have perused in Ihe Standard as an impressive and convincing piece of argument. Nevertheless, hearing murmurs of rapture arise from many corners of the ventilator, I found lhat I had only to blame my want of discernment ; and lhat the humming, ha-ing, and see-sawing, which so much offended me, werean habitual portion of Ihe mere delivery of one whose opinions obtain influential weight in the country. Ashamed of my weak pre judices, I fell into a reverie, which not even the boisterous applauses, following the concluding period of the honourable gentleman's oration, served to divert. I was far away in the days and haunts of my youth ; when my dear, good aunt Margaret, grown blind and curious, used to make Armine or myself read aloud the debates, as we sat, of a sum mer's morning, in our old hornbeam arbour, overlooking the silver Trent, or, of a winter's evening, by the fireside, interrupting some prosy speech to ask her questions of Pitt and Fox, Wyndham and Hor ner ; till I was brought to fancy, that \" The applause of listening senates to command,\" was an accomplishment worthy of a demigod. I used to envy Grattan's daughters ; and wish \u2014 not that Heaven had made me such another man, \u2014 no ! nor even the wife of such another man (girls are always consequential in these bib-and-tucker ambilions) \u2014 but his mother, \u2014 a Cornelia, a Volumnia, a Mrs. Sheridan, senior, ora venerable Coun tess of Chatham 1 These defeated projects of maternal aggrandisement were passing through my brain, and producing a smile upon my face, when I was recalled lo myself by the intense stillness of all below and around me, and the clear enunciation of Ihe new speaker, whose eloquence com manded such breathless attention. Leaning eagerly over my ledge, I tried in vain to discover from which side of the House Ihe voice pro ceeded. The speaker was completely concealed from me by the gallery; and, overcoming my natural reserve, I hazarded an inquiry of my neighbour concerning the name of the gentleman on his legs. An unceremonious \" Hush!\" silenced my inquiry j and I could scarcely for\u00b0ive myself for having provoked such a rebuke from such a person. My ire was soon appeased, and my attention otherwise engrossed ; for very few minutes served to convince me lhat now, indeed, I was listenin\" to an orator, \u2014 an orator after my own heart, an enlightened palriot,\u00b0such as, twenty years ago, I was ambitious to boast as rny son. What fervour, what conviction, bringing power in every sentence ; the voice ofa man's heart overmastering the hearts of men ; for it ad vocated the claims of the lowly, yet obtained savour in the ears of the Teat ! An hour,\u2014 two hours, did he speak on, invariably great,"], [232, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 56 invariably convincing ; abounding in matter of fact, yet high-toned, and replete with moral dignity, where the more artificial aids os oratory were admissible. I began at last lo dread Ihe fulness of his exposi tion, and wished not to be too fully convinced, lest the purpose of the speaker should be accomplished ; and when the cheers of the House proclaimed Ihe conclusion of the oration, I drew a long breath, disap pointed lhat all had been said. My mind was completely subjugated by a power of which I never dreamed before. \" What think you oithatV whispered Miss Randall, coming round to me, as all were hushing down their ejaculations, in order to do justice to the honourable but unfortunate member, the business of whose \" prattle\" it was to be \" tedious\" in reply. \" Splendid !\" said I, wishing to concentrate my encomiums into the least possible offence to the new speaker. ' ' Was not that worth coming to hear ? was not that the finest speech you ever heard in your life? Eloquent, manly, fluent, harmonious, philanthropic, philosophical ;\" and she proceeded to string epithet upon epithet, in a style to have provoked the laughter of a mule at a funeral. Now, even Napoleon the Great used to admit, that nothing chilled him so much as the false enthusiasm of others ; I, the little, may confess, that her rhapsodies froze the praises ready to burst forth from my lips. \" Yes,\" said I, coolly, \" a very good speech.\" \" Goodl \u2014 You mean divine, luminous, astounding !\" \" I mean a very able speech and speaker. Who was it?\" \" Whol\" \u2014 You cannot be in earnest! \u2014 There is but one such orator in the House, but one such orator in England, but one such in Europe, but one such in the world ! \u2014 Cicero, Demosthenes, Mira beau.\" \" And his name?\" I interrupted, dreading the explosion of her ver bosity. \" His name? His name is Lord Hartson ! But, my dear Mrs. Delaval, you must be jesting ! You were as well aware of Ihis all the time, as \" \" May I venture to remind you, that many here are listening to the debate?\" drily observed the elderly lady in the cloak, apparently ifti patientof my garrulous friend's interruption ; and away flounced Miss Randall to her seat, muttering \u2014 \" insolent, ridiculous, contemptible, under-bred,\" etc., etc. Nevertheless, the speaker on his legs was fully deserving attention. As a piece of casuistry, I have rarely heard any thing more curious than his reply ; or more striking than his art of breaking through a a few weak points of his adversary's fence, without seeming to attack"], [233, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 57 them. Nevertheless, all his art, which was considerable, did not succeed in Ihe main object, of involving in ridicule Ihe philanthropic projects of the patriot. At Ihe close of the reply, the debate was adjourned : and I waited only the announcement of my carriage, which Clarence Delaval, who was in the gallery, had promised to send up. Half-a-dozen dandies had already made their way to the ventilator, and were whispering in its divers nooks, when the old lady, who had been seated opposite me, suddenly addressed a young man, whom I recognized as Lady Clack mannan's long-chinned friend, with, \"Very well, Eustace \u2014 I am satisfied.\" \"Eustace\" seemed satisfied, too; for he extended his hand, and cordially accepted a shake of hers ; and away they hobbled downstairs together. I could not help fancying there was a degree of affectation in his avoidance of even a glance at me; but I was glad at last to have become acquainted with the monster's name; and \"Mr. Eustace\" was thenceforward to be inscribed in the tablets of my memory among mv favourite aversions. But as we were returning home, the Randall suddenly exclaimed, \" What did you think of Lord Harston? \" \" I told you before, that he was a very able speaker.\" \" I know. But himself\u2014 what did you think of him! \" \" From the place I occupied, I could not even catch a glimpse of him.\" \" Pho, pho ! The place you occupied was exactly the one where he was to be seen. That old monster in the cloak was his mother, the only woman in the world, I fancy, to whom he shows the slight est attention. Had I known it, I would have been more civil to her. When he came into the ventilator, and all the women about me were bustling up lo get a sight of him, I had a great mind to go and make her an apology, as an excuse for getting a full view of Lord Hartston.\" Inwardly congratulating myself that she had amended her inten tions, I now fell into an uneasy state of cogitation on all that had passed. I could scarcely recollect what I had said of Lord Harston's speech in his mother's hearing. Saturday.\u2014 To-day, I dined with the Herberts, quietly, we three alone ; for I look courage seriously to protest against Herbert's un kindness, in involving me in his state dinner parties. As soon as the servants were out of the room, I related to them my tale of mystery, beginning with my first impression of dislike toward Lord Hartston, and ending with my glow of enthusiasm in savour of his speech. \"I knew the history before,\" said Herbert, coldly, \"wilh the ex ception of your cold kand hot fit ; and I suppose no one is entitled to"], [234, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 58 interpret the eternal ague of a lady's temperament, but the incubus appointed to preside over it.\" \"You can have known nothing at all about the matter,\" said I, angrily; \"for I have never mentioned the subject, even to my sister.\" \" Perhaps not. It was Lord Hartston who mentioned it lo me ; one of the dearest friends I have on earth. He was rather inclined to admire you, Harriet. He had heard wonders of you from us. But Hartston is, as he has a right to be, difficult. Nothing can exceed his horror of the flirting, frivolous women of the day. It is not for such men as Hartston to run a race with your Lord Lancasters, or your Mr. Penrhyns ; aud the moment he saw you given over to dandies and milliners, he renounced all thoughts of you. Lucky enough, as you find him so ugly and disagreeable.\" \" Yes, very lucky,\" said I, more and more annoyed by all I was hearing; \"but Lord Hartston is the first man I have happened to meet who has tried to sneer me into an affection for him.\" \" I don't suppose he troubled his head much about the matter,\" said Herbert, in his usual disagreeable tone. And Armine, perceiving me lo be annoyed, turned the conversation into a different channel. Lord Hartslon, then, the great orator, \u2014 or, more truly the distin guished patriot, \u2014 is the man whose proceedings have so much annoyed me ! And now, doubtless, the old lady, whose countenance slruck me as so forbidding, will lake care to acquaint him wilh the impertinent interruption she bore wilh during the debate, and the levity lhat of fended her. After all, what signifies to me the opinion of either mother or son ? I perfeclly remember having heard from Armine that Hartston Abbey was wilhin visiting distance of them in Bedford shire, and that Lord Harlston had been the college friend of Herbert. I dare say he is just such a dry, disagreeable person as my brother in-law ! \u2014 What a delicious day ! How auspicious for our breakfast! Mild, balmy, a lillle clouded \u2014 not too much sun, not too much air, not too much any thing. The precise beau moment for a dejeuner is past : Ihe moment of lilacs, laburnums, and Gueldres roses. But the acacias are in flower, and the roses peeping out ; and roses and acacias 'are enough for any moderate woman. The American plants, too, are at their brightest ; and Lady Sittingbourn's garden is a sheet of rhodo dendrons and kahnias. I like the thoughts of a breakfast, and of being accompanied by my brother and sister. This is the first lime the Her berts have been out with me since I came to town. After nearly twelve hours' pleasure, thoroughly knocked up! Why will people so grievously overdo their diversions ? It would have been"], [235, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 59 really pleasant to get away from the glare and dust of London for a few hours, to sit under green trees and enjoy the fragrance of the gardens, and the freshness of the river, with, perhaps, a hundred persons scattered through the grounds ; and at seven, a cold dinner, wilh plenty of iced champagne, \u2014 and back to town again. But all these tents, marquees, wreaths of artificial flowersand variegated lamps, prepared for midnight, but scenting the air most abominably at mid day, \u2014 all these wooden platforms for musicians and dancing, tumbling, and equestrian exercises, \u2014 are any thing but accessory lo rural plea sures. Five hundred persons, crammed into the space of five acres, encumbered wilh bowers, trellises, kiosks, and temples, \u2014 all eager after novelty, and running here, and hurrying there, to listen lo Rus sian bands, or stare at Indian jugglers, \u2014 would ruin even the Garden of Eden; and then, to crowd away from the roses and green lawn into a stifling tent to eat turlle and venison, and drink Madeira and lime punch, is the climax of every thing disagreeable. The men, however, seemed to find much satifaction in their pates and galantines ; and even Herbert got inlo such good-humour after some excellent hock, that, in the course of the evening, he insisted upon dancing with me. The gardens looked lovely, illuminated with glow-worm lamps ; but I should have liked it better had the lawn [smelt less of Roman punch and ham-sandwiches. I never saw a larger assemblage of pretty women. But they struck me generally as being over-dressed. Open \u2014 garden \u2014 daylight does not bear a great variety of gaudy colours. Every tint and material looks tawdry and coarse, compared wilh the flowers and the skies; and nolhing seems to harmonize with the landscape but simple white. I quite agree with the poet (Cowper, I believe) who loved nothing so well as to see a woman in a white dress silting under a green tree. But, at Lady Sitlingbourne's villa, even the trees were decked out \"ornate and gay;\" so that their dryads and hamadryads could nol be too fine to do them honour. When I give a breakfast, every thing shall be fresh, sweet, and natural. We will feed under a solid roof; but roam about among the flowers and birds, under the canopy of heaven. I was rather disgusted yesterday by the conduct of Mr. Penrhyn. Shrewd as he is, he must perceive that Herbert uniformly avoids him ; yet, though he saw we were together, nolhing would prevent his sauntering about after us, and ruffling my brother-in-law's rare good-humour. He has been staying a week in Surrey for Ihe Epsom races, and seem determined lo make up for the time lost of my so ciety. A man who has been passing a week in a country-house is sure to be a bore. After August, in the usual routine of things, a po pular man goes from house to house, and rubs off the habits of each"], [236, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 60 before he reaches the next. Not so at this season ofthe year, when change from London is a strange vicissitude, calculated to make an impression. Mr. Penrhyn, accordingly, was full of Stonelands\u2014 every thing was compared wilh Stonelands, \u2014 Stonelands, of course, ohlaining the preference. Lady Sitlingbourne's flower-garden, for instance, which, though a villa-Paradise for peris, is not to be named with the shrubberies and wildernesses of a place thirty miles from town. \"The conservatories at Slonelands were so magnificent; thirty different species of the air-plant, and a vanilla plant covering a trellise a hundred feet long ; Lady Sitlingbourne's greenhouses looked so Covent-Gardenish and vulgar!\" Then, at dinner, a fine haunch excited his disgust; \"the venison-haricot at Stonelands had put him out of conceit with roasts so early in the seasons; \u2014 at least a fortnight too early for buck venison. A haunch was never eatable till there were French beans lo eat with it.\" \"But there are French beans in abundance,\" exclaimed Herbert, pointing them out. * \"Ay, a/\u2014 forced ones \u2014 forced, flavourless things, slewed up like points d'asperges. Nothing so detestable as dressed vegetables wilh a roti. At Stonelands, the potatoes were served en chemise.\" Then, at Stonelands, he had met the Rossanas ; and we had the re capilulalion of Lady Laura's Ulyrian airs, and Lady Sophia's sketches; perhaps there never was a spot abounding like Slonelands in subjects for the pencil ; and Ihe Stonelands music-room was built after a design from Dr. Bumey ; nolhing like it in England to give effect to Han del's music.\" Observing Herbert lo be on the fret, I gave my arm to Mr. Pen rhyn, and walked away ; and, by way of a topic of conversation as remote as possible from Stonelands, selected Lord Harlston's two re cent speeches. \"Oh! you are turning politician?\" cried he, with a sneer. \"I have been quite worn down wilh politics at Slonelands ! Lord Hart ston'sspeech on the poor laws? True! I recollect. Lord Rossana observed lhat Hartston was always building up cast-iron dens to cage canary-birds; or, no! lhat was not exactly it, \u2014 was always making gilt- wire aviaries lo encage eagles ; or, upon my soul, I forget how it was ; but I re member that we all laughed amazingly at Ihe remark. We were discussing, by the way, for breakfast, some rognons d la bro chette, lhat would have put George Hanton into a fever.\" \"The speech made a great impression in London,\" said I, disgusted with his frivolity. \" Of course it did, because Hartston himself has made a great im pression in London. There was such a fuss, if you remember, about his being lost wilh his yacht last year in the \u00c6gean; and when he"], [237, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE.- 61 turned up, and it turned out (according to the inquiries set on fool by the false reports) that Hartston had a clear forty thousand a-year, every body seemed determined to encumber his estate with a join ture. All the world wanted to marry him. But Hartston is devilish sly. You should have seen how cleverly he made off when the Crow hurst made up to him. Hartston knows whal he is about. The mar chioness would be glad enough to hook him for Lady Alicia; but, like other prodigious fishes, he will break her lino and disappoint her.\" Nothing I dislike more than to hear a man of family and fortune, like Mr. Penrhyn, talk of \"hooking,\" and \"husband-hunting,\" and so forth. In describing others as matrimonial prizes, he is far more suspicious of projects entertained against himself. He fancies himself in continual danger of being carried off by some man\u0153uvring mamma. His game with myself I can readily discern. He is deferring his pro posals till he can make sure of being a^epted; and though, to any man honestly in love, and honestly intenti1.ned towards me, 1 should not scruple to afford a hint to prevent him from compromising his dignity by a useless pursuit, I shall certainly leave Mr. Penrhyn to his own enlightenment. Before we left Lady Sitlingbourne's, Herbert invited me lo dine with them to-morrow, to meet his sallow friend ; but, after all I had heard and seen, I judged it more dignified to stay away. Besides, I hate an early obligato dinner on Sundays. I like to go late lo the Zoological Gardens, and remain there among the last; that is, among all the pleasant people. \u2014 I have been reading over the last fifty pages of my diary, and am shocked by its egotism. I certainly intended to write of myself \u2014 of my feelings and perceptions : yet, though I have written more of others, and less of my own .experience than I purposed, I seem to have written more selfishly lhan I thought was in my nature. I have extenuated nothing of the frailties of my acquaintance, nor set down aught in malice of my own. I had intended to keep my journal for reperusal in old age, in the hope of diverting myself with the follies of my youth ; but I suspset that if this little volume and myself should bolh survive, I should be shocked, rather than amused, by the picture it presents. If anger be a brief madness, that which we call the season is, alas ! a long one. However sober our views in the commencement, \u2014 how- j ever deliberately we sill the cup, and sip the nectarious contents, yet, at the moment we ought to lay it aside, a wild intoxication comes over us, and we quaff again and again, till all is reeling sensuality! We mean to be frugal, \u2014 we become prodigal ; we mean lo bo sage, \u2014 we"], [238, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 62 become giddy; we mean to be wisest, virtuousest, discreelest, best,\u2014 and all ends in a frothy vortex of dissipation. At first, we are in- convenienced by the healed atmosphere of the ball-room ; towards the close of the season it becomes habitual. At first, we are shocked by the rumour of a scandal ; towards the close of the season, we repeat them ourselves. At first, our better taste revolts against any new and preposterous fashion; towards Ihe close of the season, we have ex- hausted these old extravagances, and are imagining new. At first, we shrink from the familiarity of Ihe man who leans into our carriage, or enters our opera-box without ceremony ; towards the close of the season, everybody is familiar with everybody ; conversation is worn down from small-talk jinto smaller, as the gravel of the \" ring\" has been ground into stifling dust. By degrees, people adopt a jargon technical as a telegraphic dispatch ; and to listen to the dialogue of two persons of fashion, who have been frequenting the same parties and people for the last three mof%s, would sadly perplex any rational ex- pounder of Ihe king's English. Every phrase is couched in cant terms, conventional allusions, local jests; and the fine, who look upon the cockney dialect of their housemaids as the most vulgar in the lan guage, might themselves be convicted of the utterance of idioms de rived from sources far less pure than \"the well of English undefined.\" The clubs are, in some measure, the origin of the circulation of fashionable slang. Politics and the lurf may, and doubtless do, supply the staple of Iheir talk. But, after beef and mutton, comes the course of trifles and anchovy-toasl; and idle people who meet to gossip wilh each other on indifferent subjects, thirty days in the month, insensibly adopt a conventional way of talking, a cant slang of triviality, and a habit of exaggeration and embellishment. Trace some tale- of current scandal to ils source, and we shall sind the tints of the picture height ened as it passes from club lo club; beginning with pale pink at mild, indolent, sober-suited Boodle's ; and glaring from vermilion to crimson as il blushes through Ihe Travellers' and Crockford's. The anecdote and phrase in which it is couched are circulated at home by the hus band or brother ; and, at last, the \" hyperbolical fiend,\" called Fashion, is taught lo vent its pribbles and prabbles in a lone as jingling and pallry as that of the silver bell hung round the neck of my lady's lap dop. But again I am inveighing against the errors of others; for I have neither husband nor brolher to initiate me inlo Ihe accidence of fashionable slang; yet lluj, influence of Ihe season has operated as un favourably on myself as on all Ihe rest. I wonder whether it would be possible lo apply one's lip to this said poisoned chalice, after Lady Grace's fashion \u2014 \"soberly?\" Dr. Johnson, and oilier mouthers of big words, have told us, that \" absti-"], [239, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 63 nence is easier lhan temperance :\" but is sobriety, \u2014 in a certain class, and educated as nine-tenths of us are now educated, \u2014 is sobriety a possible virtue? Here are my next-door neighbours, for instance, \u2014 no sillier, I ima gine, lhan their neighbours, and belonging to an order ofsociety which the Thurtells of our society are apt lo designate respectable ; instead of \" a gig,\" they keep \" a family coach.\" Jesting apart, they are people who loast church and state, pay their taxes cheerfully, and dole out their Christmas chaldrons and blankets to the poor : righteous people in their generation, \u2014 thinking no evil, because thinking is a thing out of Iheir province ; a thing for which they pay Ihe king's ministers, Ihe rector of the parish, and their family solicitor. Yet, for the last ten years, nothing has Mrs. Gresham Ronsham, of Wrangham Hall, been pouring into the ears of her daughters, but a leperous distilment flavoured with Ihe joys of a London season. For this, the progress of their education has been hastened ; all their knowledge was to be acquired, al! their accomplishments rubbed in, wilh a view to \"coming out.\" \u2014 \" For heaven's sake! Mary, don't poke so, or I shall never venture lo lake you up lolown to be presented;\" \u2014 or, \" My dear Jane, you have not been in the stocks this morning. Consider how mortified you will be, your first season in town, when you sind yourself so much awkwarder than other girls.\" \u2014 \" Harriet! who on earth cut off that lock of hair just in sight?\" \"/did, Mamma, to give to my brother James, before he sailed for India.\" \" How in- considerate ! Have you forgotten that, the season after next, you are going to town to be presented ; and that it takes two years for a ringlet to grow properly? I am exeedingly displeased with you. Well, don't cry ; that won't remedy Ihe matter ; and, perhaps, before you come out, ringlets may be out of fashion.\" The season and ils balls are, in short, the Mahommedan heaven and its houris, promised lo incite the virtues of Ihese innocent beings; till, at length, they are snatched from the governess, torn from their village schools and feminine routine of rural benevolence, and thrust into the meretricious world of London ; Iheir fair shoulders bared, their fair locks torlured, their fair minds scribbled over by Ihe nonsense of every (lining fool ; and t amid the glare of brilliant ball-rooms, the voluptuous harmonies of delicious orchestras, the fragrance of exotics, the rattle, the dash, the splendour, Ihe flattery, Ihe whirl of London, the nectar foams brightly at Iheir lips, which is to be tasted \" soberly.\" And now, having had a peck at the mote in my brother's eye, and moralized my sill, at the expense of the Ronsham Gresharns, \u2014 away to the Zoological ; where, as it is Sunday, man and beast, with a reasonable proportion of the females of both, are wailing the good fellowship ofthe public; that is, not the very public public. The public"], [240, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 64 who privilege themselves by a payment of so much per annum, to evade the payment of so much per diem, are alone permitted to enter this Eden of Northern Marylebone on Ihe Sabbath-day. Into sweet, fresh, grassy Kensington Gardens, on the contrary, all the unliveried human species are free to enter; and the beau monde has, accordingly, taken refuge from tigers of the biped, among tigers of the quadruped species. While admiring the antics of the chimpanzee, we are sup posed to be secure from contact wilh apes of an obscure race, or baboons of other than distinguished pedigree. So 1\u2014 a vastly agreeable morning I had provided for myself! Lord Clackmannan, who, on all days but Sundays, is busy wilh the cares of office, undertook to escort me, and Lady Alicia was to be our com panion ; when, lo ! scarcely had we penetrated so far through the gay throng as the bear-pit, when Clarence managed to attach himself lo the side of his fair cousin; and thenceforward I might have been at the bottom of the pit, for any thing the anxious, vigilant father cared to the contrary. We were loo many to walk together; and as there was no chance that the marquess would relinquish Alicia's arm under such circumstances, I accepted the offered civilities of George Hanton, and left Lord Clackmannan to her guardianship. Now, as to the arm of Mr. Hanton, I protest I took it w ilh as much indifference as I should have taken lhat of \" Sare Delafals,\" or any other equally uninteresting individual. I scarcely knew who was beside me, as I amused myself with the passing groups of the highly unselect select, and reflected within myself, that an air endimanche'h fifty times more vulgar in a gentlewoman lhan in Ihe grocer's wife on whom gentlewomen waste their wit; when, lo! no sooner had we passed the tunnel than, following the motley multitude towards the elephant's enclosure, we lost sight of Lord Clackmannan. I noliced the fact to my companion, but as a matter of indifference; for her father was chaperon enough for Lady Alicia; and as to any seeling of consciousness at finding myself alone with George Hanton, I should as soon have shrunk from a lele-a-lete with my grandfather. \" How horrible to watch lhat monster's voracity !\" said he, afler we had slopped for a minute to contemplate the showers of cakes and gingerbread swallowed by the elephant : \" how thankful one ought lo be to Providence, for bestowing upon ourselves discrimination of palate!\" And, having uttered this pious apostrophe, he drew me onwards to an enclosure containing some animals apparently out of zoological fashion, \u2014 tapirs, or I scarcely know what, \u2014 against the palings of which he resolutely fixed me ; so resolutely, that I scarcely knew what to make ofa certain pressure ofthe arm which accompanied the movement. \"Il gratifies me very much,\" he began, \" that the number of weeks"], [241, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 65 during which my present intentions have been made manifest, must secure me, in your eyes, from all appearance of a disrespectful pre cipitancy; but now, my dear Mrs. Delaval, that we seem at last so perfectly to understand each other, I see no reason why we should longer defer those mutual acknowledgments, which ought to precede all other preliminaries between us.\" I was literally dumb with astonishment. He was as likely to meet with an answer from me, as from the tapirs that were routing their long noses at us through the palings. \" In those secondary points, however,\" added he, \"I flatter myself I need anticipate little contrariety. My income amounts to five-and twenty hundred a-year \u2014 yours, I fancy, to something more \u2014 (more than double, of which he was well aware 1) \u2014 and I have a comfortable, well-situated house, which we need only re-furnish, to render it all you can wish. Our habits of life, in other respects, assimilate. We are both fond of society \u2014 both of the same tastes and modes of thinking ; for, though I have not yet the honour to be admitted familiarly lo your house, I have had much pleasure in learning from my friend, Clarence, that your table and chef axe among the best in London. (Our ' modes oi thinking!') Under these circumstances, I feel our mutual felicity to be secure. Our fortune, though not large, is sufficient for two persons possessed of a capital house in town for the season, who spend the remainder of the year with their friends, and are not am bitious of a family. An occasional winter at Paris, or autumn at Spa, or Carlsbad, might vary the scene; and as we should command the best society, and\" \u2014 \u25a0 \u2014 \" Stay 1\" cried I, as one of the long-nosed beasts made a direct attack upon my instep, which seemed to restore me to my recollec tion; \"I am very wrong to allow you to proceed in this way when \" \"No, no! you are every thing that is good and kind.

We had now reached the bird-houses ; and, from the circle of delighted auditors listening to the gentillesses of the pink cockatoo, who was sidling on his stand in the sunshine, a whole party of the Beresfords caught sight of me, and in a minute I was surrounded ; my arm still inclosed in that of George Hanton, and exposed to the high-pressure of his tender gratitude. The usual ejaculations followed \u2014 ' ' Isn't this a doat of a bird ? \" Quite a darling!\" \" Such a dear, nice creature 1 \" \" Pretty Poll !\" \"Cocoa ready?\" \"Did you stay out the ballet last night? \" Couldn't get my carriage up.

That creature is making for your shoulder.\" \" Do you remember what old Lady Burlington said when her macaw bit a piece out of her friend's arm \u2014 ' I hope to Heaven it won't make the poor dear creature sick!'\" \" Naughty Poll 1\" etc., etc. In short, I had gradually rejoined Alicia and her father; and there was no immediate opportunity for resuming my odious explanations. Mr. Hanton wore the impertinent smile of a favoured lover; and, could any thing have increased the ugliness of a face so vulgar, so common, so unintellectual, he would have been more than usually disgusting. We were soon joined by Lord Lancaster and Lord Hilton, and loitered about the gardens with the Beresfords, making the same sapient remarks uttered there Sunday after Sunday ; such as \u2014 ' ' What a vastly conjugal couple!\" \" Who? Mr. and Mrs. William C. ?\" \"No! that pair of blue aud buff macaws! What a fate; to be caged in eternal fidelity, as an example for ladies and gentlemen ! \" \" How those cha mois remind one of Chamouny !

Do let us go, Lady Evelyn, and see the kangaroos swallow their young.\" \"Do they really swallow them?\" \" To be sure \u2014 I have seen them a thou sand times.\" We were leaving the gardens at a quarter before eight, to dress for dinner. Lord Clackmannan's carriage coming round first, he and Lady Alicia left me to the care of Lords Lancaster and Hilton, Mr. Hanton retaining the most obstinate possession of my arm ; all three talking and laughing loud, by way, I suppose, of making themselves conspi cuous : when, lo! in walked Herbert, arm-in-arm with Lord Hart ston. Instead of stopping, my brother-in-law touched his hat to me with (he most provoking air of superciliousness : his companion looked pointedly away. \"My friend Hartston is growing the greatest of great men,\" said Hanton, impertinently. \" He has never lost the air with which he used to declaim, on Harrow speech-days, ' My name is Caius Mar cius!' \" \" I cannot laugh at Hartston,\" replied Lord Hilton, with more good sense than I expected from him. \" Hartston is an honour to the times, and the hope of the country. I am always willing to take off my hat to Hartston as low as he pleases.\" \" Probably he pleases little or nothing about the matter,\" muttered Hanton, putting me into my carriage, with a look and smile of most provoking significance. And, as I turned off inlo the ring, there stood the ugly creature, affecting to watch me out of sight, while Lord Lan caster and Lord Hilton planted themselves behind him, bursting wilh laughter athisaffected attitude of sentimentality. As Iwas pretty sure of meeting the wretch, if I pursued my intention of going, as usual, to Arlington Street, I resolved to stay at home, and, after dinner, dis patch to his \"well-situated mansion,\" a letter expressive of regret, lhat 1 should have given him sufficient encouragement lo mislead him into proposals which, for reasons unnecessary to explain, I begged to de cline.

How mortifying to see my elegant-minded sister humbled into a drudge! \u2014 for, after all, Ihis milder species of drudgery is more vexatious to a proud spirit than actual labour ; and, for the sake of a husband who so little seems to appreciate the sacrifice ! My sister's face, as she bent over her cambric muslin, seemed rather portentous. Supposing her grave looks to originate in some domestic disarrangement, I ventured to make inquiries. \" Any thing the matter ?\" said I. \" No, nothing the matter ; only Ihe idea of your marrying that Mr. Penrhyn vexes me.\" \" My marrying Mr. Penrhyn ?\" \" Herbert, you know, so particularly dislikes him, that I fear the marriage will cause an estrangement among us.

Perhaps it would have been wiser to propose sending back the carriage when it had left me in St. James's Place ; but, in pity to his thin shoes and tired face, I at once consented to set him down in Al bemarle Street. As we passed the steps of Crockford's, Lord Lan caster and half a dozen of the elite of the roues were standing on the steps, \u2014 smoking, laughing, and quizzing all who went by ; from the squeaking chimney-sweepers to the gay people from Almack's.

Herbert has resolved to leave London on the first of July ; and I have, therefore, only another fortnight to enjoy of Armine's society. She is still eager that I should fulfil my promise of passing a month or two of the autumn wilh them in Bedfordshire, and still confident of my acquiescence ; but I cannot bear the thoughts of becoming an in mate under the same roof with Herbert, more especially a roof where his authority prevails. I am sure we should disagree. Just as the carriage was turning down Brook Street, after I left my sister, it was suddenly stopped, and Herbert himself appeared at the window. \" I wish you joy 1\" said he, with one of his bitterest sneers. \" Thank you !\" I replied, resolved not to gratify him by inquiring the cause of his felicitations. \" Ah 1 you had heard it already ? I was in hopes, I should be the first person to convey the joyful tidings.\" \"What joyful tidings?\" cried I, startled out of my resolution. \" The death of Lord Penrhyn. I have just come from the club. The old man died at eight this morning ; leaving a clear rent-roll of seventy thousand a-year, sour magnificent country houses, and one in town. You are in luck 1 I wish you good morning.\" My unexpressed wishes for him were far less amiable ; but, resolved not to appear disconcerted, I kissed my hand as the carriage drove on. I was going to Smith's, for the purpose of getting a bracelet mended ; and, while giving my orders, in came Lady Mardynville; who, in stead of pursuing her business, whatever it might be \u2014 if, indeed, she had any but to be disagreeable \u2014 began curtseying and simpering with such an enormous accession of deference, that I am convinced she has heard the false report of my marriage, and the true one of Lord Pen rhyn's death. Terrified lest she should accost me with congratulations before all the shopmen, which would spread Ihe story from one end of London to Ihe other, I talked so fast and so confusedly to Smith about the snap of my stupid bracelet, that he must have thought me be witched, while she, doubtless, believed me to be giving orders for a riviere of brilliants. At last I hurried away, as if making off with some of the trinkets I had been turning over. In what a curious position have I involved myself! Here am I con-"], [247, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 71 demned by the voice of the world to marry, by way of penance, a man, the very idea of whose importance has set Lady Mardynville's knees bobbing ! Seventy thousand a-year ! And I, who am thought so rich, and who find myself so rich, with six ! What might one not do wilh so classical an income ! What might one not do for it, except marry an unprincipled, heartless man like Mr. Pen rhyn? I beg his pardon, Lord Penrhyn. To be sure, every one is not so prejudiced against him as Herbert. I know many houses where he is a great favourite. At the time Mrs. Percy exposed herself on his account, no one seemed to think it extraordinary ; and certainly his prospects of fortune could have nothing to do with herengouement. Now, of course, every one will think him charming ; so that the ap plauses of the world will, for the future, go for nothing. To-morrow, Ascot, with Lady Cecilia. \u2022 Friday. \u2014 I prefer Ascol a thousand times to Epsom. The road is less rural, but more amusing. The rabble-rout, inseparable from a race-course, is at Ascot a rustic, at Epsom a swell mob ; the com pany is more select ; and, above all, the presence of royalty dignifies the affair. The prickers in scarlet liveries, who keep the ground, give an airof courtliness to the place ; and one feels to be in the near neigh bourhood of Thy forest, Windsor, and thy green retreats. Lady Cis was not in spirits. She should not attempt such exertions ; for public places of all kinds are her abhorrence ; and she is the least locomotive person in the world. No one can be a more charming causeuse ; but, to converse like her sex, she must be sitting in her own chair, with her feet on her own footstool, her own lapdog on Ihe sofa near her, and her own satchet of mare'chale powder lying on the table by her side. Her mind is so acclimate to her boudoir, that else where she becomes absent and fretful. Yesterday, she found the day too hot, the roads too dusty ; she could not arrange our parasols to her liking ; and when we arrived on the course, Was distracted by the noise of tabors and fifes, and the bawling of the pea-and-thimblemen ; and would have it that our horses were going to be frightened. Her ordinary movements are so circumscribed, that she is not prepared for the common occurrences of life ; and yesterday she was herself so bored, that, had it not been for Clarence, she would have ended with borin\u00b0- me. Happy they who know no other calamity in life than lhat of being bored! Yet, in this world of tortures and privations, how many of us presume to complain of that as of the greatest of evils. \" All the world\" was at Ascot ; and Lord Clackmannan as master of the buckhounds, or the horse, or I know not what, managed to procure us a privileged place on the course, opposite to the royal stand, where we saw \"all the world\" to advantage. Lady C. and Lady"], [248, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 72 Alicia were with the king and queen ; and Clarence had the happi ness of doatingupon his idol through an opera-glass Ihe whole of the day. Lord Hartston passed us twice; and I observed the Duke of Merioneth, who was talking to us at the time, take off his hat with the deference he would have shown to a prince of the blood. What influence resides in a celebrated name ! How far beyond all ordinary distinctions of rank ! I perceive that the report of my engagement to Lord Penrhyn has gained ground. The duke inquired of me when I intended to leave town for the season; then checked himself, observing, \"But I beg pardon\u2014 I conclude nolhing is yet settled ?\" Vexed by his inference, I confided my dilemma to Cecilia, who treated it as a delicate distress not worth mentioning. \" Leave people to find out their mistake,\" said she, with her usual languid air of indifference; \"or, if you like it better, convert the mistake into reality. You know I have long recommended you to marry Penrhyn.\" \"But, as he has never hinted an intention of proposing\" \u2014 \" Of course not. Lord Penrhyn is too much a man of the world, and knows too well his own value, to fling his hand at the head of any woman on a short acquaintance. People of his kind are seldom in a hurry to be married. It is only boys like Clarence, or old lords dropping into an estate and wanting an heir, who play the fool-hardy in such matters.\" \u2014 We came back from Ascot, tired, dusty, thirsty, sunburnt, cross ; and doubly cross at finding ourselves engaged to a late dinner at old Lady Burlington's. But the dinner revived us. The room was cool ; the party, intelligent and chatty. I heard the dowager say to L , who sat next her at table, \" I have been moving heaven and earth this season to get that Lord Hartston ; but he will not be had. I have written to him, and told him I was godmother to his grandfa ther ; I have been at him through every living creature of his ac quaintance, from his sister to his bootmaker ; but the man is inflexible. I fancy he is afraid of being decoyed into one of my lion-feeds; but I hope I appreciate him better. Fox, you know, was my great friend ; so was Sheridan, so was Burke, so was Fitzpatrick ; and I shall go miserable to my grave, unless Lord Hartston dines with me before the season is over.\" \"No; pray don't die while you have so good a cook,\" said her neighbour, helping himself to an e'pigramme de volatile pique aux crevettes. \"You only want Hartston as a novelty \u2014 in managerial phrase \u2014 to draw a good house for you.

I really wish, my dear, you would get me presented to him.\" \" To my disagreeable brother-in-law?\" \"No, no ; the other.

Had I not interdicted the subject during dinner, I should have heard of nothing else, and I detest races. I have not been to a race these sixty years.\" Friday.\u2014 How odiously provoking ! When the Morning Post was brought me at breakfast, so little did I imagine it could contain any thing of personal interest to myself, that I ran through a whole column about Ascot, before I was attracted by a paragraph headed \" The late Lord Penrhyn,\" beginning wilh an account of his \" crimson Genoa velvet coffin, with silver-gilt handles and plate ;\" and ending with, \" We learn that the present Lord, who is in his forty-first year, is about to lead lo the hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished Mrs. Delaval, widow of Colonel Delaval, of Delaval Castle, and daughter to the late distinguished General Sir Richard Montresor, K.B.\" I am now, indeed, perplexed. If I send a denial to the newspa per, Lord Penrhyn may say, \"Mrs. Delaval might have waited till she was asked;\" while, if I allow the assertion to remain unnoticed, the fact will be admitted as certain. I know not whom to consult. Herbert is so ungracious on the subject, and Lady Cecilia considers every thing so unimportant that does not relate either to herself or Clarence. I foresee lhat I shall he exposed to all sorts of annoyances by this foolish history. It would not surprise me to receive a letter in the course of the day from Lady Mardynville, asking me to stand godmother to her next child ! How the season brightens ! I expected that, by this time, my gaieties would a little relax ; instead of which, this morning has brought cards for four balls, two breakfasts, and a fete costumee. Dissipation seems to grow with what il feeds on ; and, now the intoxi cation of pleasure has become fairly epidemic, all calculation, all mo deration, is thrown aside. No one has a moment for reflection. The vigils of the ball over-night leave one scarcely time lo dress in the morning for the business of the day, viz. visits and Ihe Park. Then another toilet, and a dinner party ; then another, and more balls. The sound of an orchestra is perpetual in one's ears ; and full dress so habitual, that I shall scarcely know myself again in \" white linen.\" I should like a week's quiet, and then a recommencement. The six months' quiet which really will follow all this stir and sparkling, does not seem altogether so desirable. I am now so accustomed to live in a crowd, that I dread \" the clock and crickets\" which sound so loud in the stillness of a dull home. Saturday. \u2014 Verily, I have my revenge for the insolent, sneering bow wilh which George Hanton passed me the other day in the Park ; and which was intended less for me than for Lord Lancaster and Sir Jervis Hall, with whom he was riding : ample revenge / Yesterday, as I was on a variety visit to Mrs. Hemstitch (the mantua-maker who"], [251, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 75 formerly read me such a lecture on fine-lady ism), I met, on the stairs, a fine lad of about fifteen, his eyes swollen out of his head wilh crying. As the good woman happened to be alone, I asked her, indiscreetly enough, whether the youth was her son, and what was the cause of his tribulation. \" My sons, madam, are at decent schools, and, I trust, in decent clothing,\" said she, proudly. \" If you had examined lhat poor lad, you would have perceived him to be almost in rags. He is in afflic tion for his father, who is dying in one of my attics.\" \" Doyoulet lodgings?\" said I, as inconsiderately as before. \"No, madam ; I simply afford a miserable refuge to an indigent family. Have you any orders for me this morning?\" \" Pray forgive me, if I have offended you,\" I persisted : \" but you have now excited my interest. Are these poor people in a situation to which I can afford any \u2014 any alleviation?\" \" If you mean in the way of charity, I believe, madam, that the most trifling sum would be highly acceptable. I am working for a large family of my own, and, consequently, unable to do much for them. I provide them with food and medicine, but the poor old gen tleman will soon require a funeral. It ought to be a decent one, for he is a clergyman of the Church of England.\" \" As she perceived by my countenance that I was now deeply in terested, I persuaded her to relate the whole melancholy history. The dying man, it seems, served for many years the curacy of her native place, and eked out a small salary by taking pupils. The state of the times, sickness in his family, and, at length, a paralytic attack, threw him into distress. He was obliged to leave his cure ; and, from trou ble to trouble, became an inmate ofthe Fleet prison. \"At the commencement of poor Mr. Forster 's distresses, madam,\" said Mrs. Hemstitch, addressing me, \"I took his daughter to learn my business; a very excellent, intelligent girl, much beloved in my esta blishment. The debt for which her father was taken up, was a small one ; and she was in hopes that one or other of his former pupils would release him. I even wrote a leiter for her to one of them (a rich gen tleman of the name of Hanton) staling the circumstances. He re fused, however, saying that he did not consider it his business to repair the improvidence of others : at last, the sum was made up among my young people. Wilh my husband's leave, I took in the poor gentle man and his son, who were totally destitute, and for eight months past they have been my inmates. The lad is a sine, well-taught, scholarly lad, and might make his way in the world, if any one would lend him a helping hand.

Such, madam, is the great world 1 \u2014 Have you any orders for me this morning?\" My orders, of course, regarded the Foster family. Thank Heaven, I have now an honest excuse to myself for the contempt wilh which I have always regarded George Hanton. \u2014 So ! \u2014 half-a-dozen letters of congratulation on my approaching marriage to Lord Penihyn ! It is easy to write and contradict Ihe re port ; but I am beginning to feel seriously annoyed by the predica ment in which I am placed. I learn from the newspapers, that the late lord is to be conveyed lo-morrow to the family vault ; after which, I conclude my lord will make his re-appearance in public, and, of course, save me the trouble of further vindication. Considering the intimate terms on which we stand, perhaps it would be better if I at once frankly alluded to the report. He might, however, imagine it a ruse to bring on a proposal \u2014 men are such coxcombs. There lives not Ihe one to whom I would again sacrifice myself in marriage ; or /, at least, have not at present the honour of his acquaintance. If the affairs of Cupid do not flourish in my establishment, I suspect Ihey are proceeding wilh much alacrity chez mes voisines. Signor Bravura's cabriolet is no longer the only one stationed at the door of Mr. Gresham Ronsham. From twelve o'clock till three, a vehicle of lhat flash-dandy description which makes one suspect it to be hired for Ihe season, is in constant attendance. As soon as the family-coach rumbles off, on its daily round of visitationing and park-grinding, off gallops the cabriolet, as never well-bred cabriolet was heard to gallop; and at seven o'clock, so soon as the well-inhabited quarters of the town begin to send forlh fumes of soup and patties, back gallops it again; and a hero, wilh well-dyed whiskers and muslachios, and well varnished shoes, leaps out, leaps in, and the ding-dong of the dinner bell commences. When I return home at night from a party, if lights are still burning in the drawing-room of the Gresham Ronshams, the galloping horse is sure to be pawing impatiently at the Gresham Ron shams' door ; strong symptoms of a courtship in the family! and, from a little feverish, anxious patch of red on the cheek of the second daugh ter, I suspect Miss Augusla to be the savoured Dujcinea.

I mentioned the story of the Forster family to Herbert, with Ihe view of procuring his advice and assistance in disposing of the poor boy, when released from attendance on his father; and my brother-in-law promised to think the matter over, and in a week let me know the result of his cogitalions. To-day, I went to Mrs. Hemstich, ostensibly to order a gown, but in reality lo learn the state ofthe old man, without the ostentation of playing the benefactress. I did not intend to proceed immediately to the subject, \u2014 (he good woman is so blunt and strange ! But the mo ment she could get rid of the dowager Duchess of Hampshire, who was trying to persuade her to make a dress with seven breadths out of eight yards of Sewell and Cross's cheap narrow satin, she hurried to me with a face so radiant with joy, and such a profusion of thanks, that I hardly knew what lo make of her. \" Such a provision ! such a windfall ! so much above Ihe poor boy's expectations \u2014 though certainly not ahove*his deserts. I am sure, madam, I am as grateful as if it were a son of my own. As lo poor Caroline Forster, she has been crying for joy all night, and the old gentleman seems quite revived. He wants to get up and be dressed, but the apothecary has forbid it.\" By degrees, I obtained an explanation. Yesterday morning, George Forster was sent for to Lord Harlston's office in Whitehall, and exa mined for two hours by the secretary, as to his proficiency in writing, accounts, and summing up abstracts. He was desired to return at six o'clock, when he had an interview with Lord Hartston himself, and the welcome intelligence that he was appointed to a clerkship of seventy pounds a-year, in an office holding out prospects of advance ment. \"Your salary will commence from this day,\" said his lord ship ; \"your duties, when I find it expedient to give you notice. At present, they will be performed by a young man attached to my own establishment.\" How I long to thank him for the considerateness with which he has performed this benevolent action !

The inaffability of Ihe two girls is already beginning to assume a pinched, soured, discontented turn of countenance, which has made them old before their lime. I meet these people frequently at the duke's, at Lady Clackmannan's, and other elect places ; but have been careful to avoid seeming to seek their acquaintance ; for they have a way of fixing upon one a stony unrecognizing look, intended lo mark the most pre-eminent contempt. To-day, to my great amazement, as I was writing notes in my drawing-room, \" Mrs. Percy and Lady Maria Lancaster\" were an nounced ; and, without any further attempt at introduction, I received from the latter a very gracious curtsey. I could by no means under stand the visit : for Mrs. Percy has scarcely made her appearance here for the last monlh ; or, to speak more correctly, from the time Lord Penrhyn began to pay me atlenlion. \"Is not this S pretty Mbuse?\" said Mrs. Percy, addressing her companion, as soon as they were seated. Lady Maria raised her eye-glass, glanced round the room, and muttered a scarcely intelligible \u2014 \"Very 1 \" \"Quite like one of Giroux's baby-houses ! \" Another glance, and another faint \" Very ! ' \" One longs to put it all under a glass-shade.\" Another glance \u2014 no answer. \"And such exquisite flowers !

I beg your pardon, Lady Maria, for now I remember Lady Evelyn is your cousin.\" \"Is she?\" \" Of course she is. Old Lord Rockwell's daughter, you know.\" \" We do not visit her.\" At this moment, to my great annoyance, the servants announced Lady Mardynville. The woman has no right to call on me, for I have never intruded upon her; and when she curtseyed into the room. I felt convinced she would try to fasten her acquaintance on Lady Maria Lancaster , or commit me in some other way, equally provoking. While she gabbled through her opening complimenls, Mrs. Percy and her friend sat exchanging looks of disgust ; more particularly when she suddenly launched into certain family histories \u2014 of her son, Ernest Augustus, having won the rowing match at Eton ; and her little boy, William Henry, having the chicken-pox, which made her very uneasy, on account of her daughters, Adelaide Ida and Sophia Ma tilda. \"But, my dear Mrs. Delaval,\" cried she, suddenly interrupting herself, and looking round, as if to ascertain that none but friends were present, \" I must not forget that I came here expressly to offer you my congratulations.\" \"On what account?\" said I, resolved not to appear too readily conscious. \"Oh, my dear madam! it is impossible you can affect ignorance, when all London is talking of it.\" \"If you allude,\" said I, gaining courage, \"to an idle paragraph, which appeared in one of the morning papers, allow me to assure you that it is as groundless as such reports generally prove to be.\" \" You quite surprise me ! \" cried Lady Mardynville, trying to look arch; \"for, I assure you, when I complimented Lady Cecilia De laval last night, at Ihe Ancient Concert, she did no! affect to deny it.\" \" She probably did not think it worth while,\" said I, vexed to notice"], [256, "SO DIARY.;OF A DESENNUYEE. the significant smiles passing between the Percy and Lady Maria ; \" being aware that no one has given it a moment's credit.\" \"And then, your brolher-in-law, Mr. Herbert\u2014 I stopped him yesterday, as he was going into Arthur's ; and he answered my felici tations, by saying, jokingly, that, whenever the ceremony took place, I should officiate as one of the bridesmaids.\" Again, Lady Maria executed a languid smile. \" Are you going to the Duke of Merioneth's to-morrow?\" said I to Mrs. Percy, hoping to change the conversation ; but Lady Mardynville had already begun another speech. \" But, my dear Mrs. Delaval, what will you say, when I tell you that Lord Penrhyn's old aunt, Mrs. Margaret Penrhyn, goes about telling every one that the family are quite enchanted with the match ; for that her nephew had an unfortunate liaison with some married wo man, to which his own marriage would, of course, put an end.\" \" I should say, that Mrs. Margaret Penrhyn knew even less of her nephew's affairs than the rest of the world,\" I replied. Then, scarcely daring to look Mrs. Percy in the face, I renewed my question about the Duke of M. \" I believe there is nothing at Merioneth House to-morrow night?'' said she, coolly addressing Lady Maria, \"Nothing,\" replied her ladyship, calmly. \" Nolhing at Merioneth House,\" I persisted ; \" but the duke gives a small dejeuner at his villa.\" \"You are mistaken,\" said Lady Maria, with a smile of contemptuous superiority. \"It is some dejeuner at Lady Sitlingbourne's; and people have made confusion,\" said Mrs. Percy. \" No ; the dejeuner is at Hazlebank,\" said I, calmly. \" The duke was half an hour in our box, at the French play, last night. I assure you he has no breakfast to-morrow at Hazlebank, or elsewhere,\" retorted Lady Maria. Turning to my writing-lable, I now quietly placed in her ladyship's hands a billet, containing the following lines : \u2014 \"Pray, my dear Mrs. Delaval, do not disappoint me of the pleasure of your company on Thursday nexi. I shall breakfast at Hazlebank at four, \u2014 en petit comili, my own family, the Clackmannans, Rossanas, Campo-Fioritos, all our own set. Faithfully yours, \"Merioneth.\" Lady Maria looked aghast, Mrs. Percy indignant. ' ' What an absurd arrangement ! \" cried she. \"A breakfast at four o'clock lo spoil your dinner ; and an afternoon spent in talking Pastor Fido among the roses and lilies.\""], [257, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 81 \" I am so fond of plants, lhat I could not pass my time more agree ably.\" \" How very delightful ! \" ejaculated Lady Mardynville, who had remained dumb during our dispute. \" What an enjoyable little party 1 Nolhing I have more at heart than to make his grace's acquaintance. Sir Robert has an estate in Ireland adjoining his, which, of course, must make us perfectly known to him by name ; but it happens that I have never had an opportunity of being presented to the Duke of Me rioneth, in a manner that would accord with our mutual position in the world.\" Lady Maria put up her glass, and stared, as she had formerly done at my room, at the strange woman, \u2014 so strange as to be unacquainted with his grace of Merioneth ; the strange woman probably entertain ing a similar degree of contempt for the party, in whose box his grace could sil for half an hour without honouring them by an invitation to his breakfast. It was a great relief to me when the trio rose to go away. Lord Lancaster quitted Mrs. Crowhurst's side to-day in the Park (who, to do her justice, does look like an angel on horseback), to take a turn with me ; when I mentioned to him that, d propos of the skies falling, his sister, Lady Maria, had done me the honour of a visit. \" Called upon you with Mrs. Percy?\" he reiterated. \" I wonder what impertinence was on the tapis between them ? Beware of them 1 Maria and Mrs. Percy would play Mrs. Candour and Lady Sneerwell better than any actresses that ever graced the stage.\" Amiable enough on his part to speak thus of his sister. The Lan caster seem quite a nest of cobra di manillas \u2014 a sting like the prick of a pin, but venomously fatal. After dinner, before dressing for Almack's, I went and sat an hour with Cecilia, who is what she calls \" nervous;\" that is, out of hu mour. She fancies the Clackmannans suspect her of encouraging her son's attachment to his cousin Alicia; \" Although my sister ought to be well aware,\" she observes, \" that the thing is wholly in opposi tion to my principles. I disapprove of cousins intermarrying.\" \" From a religious scruple? \"Religious nonsense ! No ! Because such matches are fatal to the extension of family connexion. Then Clarence is poor, and must marry an heiress ; and Alicia has pretensions of the highest order, and ought not to marry any thing under a peerage. An alliance be tween them would be ruin to both ; and it is all my sister Clackman nan's fault, who chose to let them go on billing and cooing like two canary-birds in a cage, year after year, at Clackmannan Court ; till the two silly creatures fancied (hey must be intended for a pair.

I see how it will be !\u2014 I shall be worn out before the season is over; and there will be an eternal brouillerie between the Clackmannans and myself. My dear Harriet, see what you can do for me with the young people.\" \" Why not send Clarence abroad, as you intended?\" \"Send\\\\\\m\\ Clarence will be of age next month. Can I pack him up like a portmanteau and dispatch him to Paris against his will? He positively declares he will not leave England till he has come to some arrangement with Alicia. There will be a clandestine engagement, a family esclandre, and I shall die ofone of my nervous attacks.\" And nolhing but a dose of \u00e6ther preserved her from a sit of hysterics on the spot. By degrees, however, we began to talk of other things ; \u2014 the breakfast at Hazlebank, \u2014 the Lancaslers, \u2014 Mr. Crowhurst, \u2014 and, at length, I tried to persuade her to dress and accompany me to Almack's. \" Dress! \u2014 how can you be so inconsequente? I am horribly ill. I have been sitting in my peignoir all day. I have not even had the blinds up. I have not seen a creature except Halsord. Dress! I could just as soon ascend Mont Blanc.\" \"But you will have an opportunity of seeing how things go on be tween Clarence and his cousin.\" \"My dear child, I do know how things go between Clarence and his cousin.\" \"But if the duke is there, he will probabiy ask you to Hazlebank, and you are so fond oi a partie de campagne.\" \"Yes, but not at a few hours' notice. The great pleasure of those things is a demie-toilette bien fraichs, and very striking. There is no surer criterion of taste than a pretty demie-toilette. And I really have nolhing new for to-morrow. No! pray don't talk about dressing. What o'clock is it?\" \"Not ten,\u2014 you have plenty of lime. Ring and give orders to Ga brielle.\" ' ' Impossible\u2014 quite impossible. My nerves are perfectly shattered. I am not even sure that I have a ticket. I have not been there this fortnight. Is this the first of a new subscription?\" \" No ; Ihe last of an old one. I know you have one. Let me look in your engagement-box. See ! here it is. I shall ring for Gabrielle, and come back and fetch you at eleven.\" \" Pray, do not torment me! Even if I dress, I shall never be able to go. Do you know if my sister is to be there ?\" \" Yes; she begged me to meet her at eleven.\" \"Well, I shall make Ihe effort, lo please you. I am always makins efforts for Ihe satisfaction of others. Perhaps I may be able to slay half an hour. To say the truth, I rather want lo see Lord Wincham"], [259, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 83 or Lord Hartston, without writing to them to come here. I have been thinking it might be possible to get Clarence an attache-ship al Naples or Constantinople ; and one is sure of meeting the ministers at Al mack's.\" At eleven, accordingly, I called for her; and never saw her look better or more captivating. The moment the Duke of Merioneth came in, she carried him off to one of the upper benches, where no one was likely to interfere with her, in the way she has of appropriating people without any appearance of design; and so successful were her little agaceries, that in ten minutes she had not only accomplished an invi tation for herself and Clarence to the breakfast, but could have procured one for Lady Mardynville, or any other obnoxious individual, had she been so inclined. While they were chatting together, Mrs. Crowhurst, who affects to palliate her impertinences under a character of origina lity, sauntered towards them, saying, \"Duke, I find you have a de jeuner, to which no one is tobe invited; which makes me, of course, determine lo be ofthe party. Say ' yes,' with a good grace, and tell me how happy you shall be to see me.\" \"Mosthappj, on any other day; to-morrow, pas possible. I have no permission to extend my invitations.\" \"Permission? from whom?\" \"That is not my secret. When you give me one to keep, you shall find me equally faithful to the trust.\" And he recommenced his conversation wilh Lady Cecilia, in a tone that rendered it impossible for Mrs. Crowhurst to renew her attack ; so away she went to flutter, \"like an eagle in a dovecote,\" the flock of pigeons she has marked as her own among the lordlings and boy-ho nourables. Bul my own turn was coming. I trust and believe, that nolhing is more indifferent to me lhan the homage of such a man as Lord Penrhyn, whom I neither like nor respect; and I should, indeed, despise myself if, independent as I am, his recent accession of importance could alter my intentions towards him. Nevertheless, I must own myself deeply piqued by the line of conduct he has taken up. I did not dream of meeting him at Almack's ; it was hardly decent, I think, that he should appear at a ball so soon after his grandfather's interment. In these times, few men care for their grandfather; but, les bienseanecs avant tout! We parted intimate friends. He was wilh me in St. James's Place an hour one morning after that unlucky drive from Almack's; chatty, agreeable, empressa as usual, \u2014 if not quite a declared lover, as nearly so as possible. He came to our box, at the opera, on the Sa turday night, and sat there a fixture, comme d I'ordinaire. On the Monday, Lord Penrhyn died, and of course I saw no more of him. Last night, at Almack's, having just finished a waltz with my little. o *"], [260, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 84 cousin Clarence, I was proceeding on his arm into the tea-room, when in the doorway, sable-suited as night, or an inheriting peer, stood his lordship. I expected he would extend his hand as usual en passant; and almost seared I put out mine to meet it, when, lo ! a bow, as frozen and distant as from the Duke of to a new-made baronet ! I was staggered, and only the more amazed when I saw, that by his side stood his friend, the Crocodile, louche beanie, mouth, eyes, and ears, as usual, wide open, who has probably circulated the history, by this time, through White's, Crockford's, and Ihe Travellers'. Lord Penrhyn remained at the ball as long or longer than I did, but never once approached within miles of me. He danced only with Lady Sophia Rossana, and talked only to her family. But I fancied, at one moment, I saw significant looks passing between him and Mrs. Percy. What can be the meaning of all this ? Does he pretend to resent the newspaper reports of our marriage ? or, perhaps, (who knows ?) fancies that his character was injured by being seen with me tete-d-tefe in my carriage ! I am half afraid that Clarence, who is preux comme Bayard, was going to take more notice than was desirable of the affair. He knows the familiar terms existing between myself and Penrhyn only last week ; and, I suspect, observed me offer my hand. Glancing at my little cousin just afterwards, I saw his cheek flushed, and his eyes sparkling. \" Has there been any coolness between you and Penrhyn ?\" he in quired. \" Comme vous voyez,\" I replied, as equivocatingly as I could. \" I see only that he is a d d coxcomb,\" said Clarence, with more warmth than became the time and place ; \" I hope, dear Mrs. Delaval, you will take no further notice of the fellow.\" \" To cut a person is, in my opinion, to take the greatest possible notice of him,\" I replied. \" I shall henceforward treat Lord Pen- rhyn as I feel towards him, \u2014 wilh complete indifference.\" I suspect Clarence related what had occurred to Lady Cecilia ; for she came to me immediately afterwards, and, without saying a word, carried me off to Lady Clackmannan's clique, and devoted her whole evening to me. This gave me an opportunity of noticing how much her feelings prevail over what she calls her \" principles,\" in the affair between Clarence and Alicia. She adores her son, and doats upon her niece ; and, though fully aware that the match would be most impru dent, and intends to discourage it, unconsciously lends the young peo- ple all the assistance in her power. She cannot bear to see her boy looking uneasy, and whispers, \" She is gone into the tea-room.\" By and by, fearing that Lady Alicia may forget her engagements to dance with her cousin, she exclaims, \" Remember this is the fourth"], [261, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 85 contredanse \u2014 remember you are engaged to Clarence.\" I do not wonder Lady Clackmannan is angry with her, bul she cannot help it. The warmest feelings are still glowing under the leprous crust of worldliness she has contracted in the contaminating lazar-house of fashion. A charming day at Hazlebank ! I soon discovered why the duke was so difficult in his invitations, and so early in his hour. The party was made to meet his mother ; avery superior woman, who lives in retirement at a fine old family mansion, near Harefield, and is treated by her family with marked respect. The duchess has a most distin guished look. She reminds me of Sir Thomas Lawrence's full-length portrait of Mrs. Siddons. I thought her a little stately, till I was pre sented to her by her son, when I found her high-breeding tempered by the mildest courtesy. With such a mother, I no longer wonder that the Duke of Merioneth has shown himself difficult in the choice of a wife. Not having been at Hazlebank before, I was much interested by the collection of modern pictures and sculptures ; still more so, by its con servatories, containing (he first collection of exotics in the kingdom. The duke, aware that my engouement on this point equals his own, was good-natured enough to be my cicerone, and explain all that was worth notice. Our party collected in the orangery, where he was pointing out a new system of engrafting practised in Italy, when he suddenly appealed to Lord Hartslon,who was standing near us, for con firmation of some startling facts, compelling him to be a third person in our conversation ; which lasted so long, by the way, lhat the satur nine philosopher and myself can no longer avoid being on speaking terms. We had an elegant dejeuner without effort or pretensions; and afterwards, as (he evening was warm, came out under the cedar- Irees to take ices and coffee. It was all very pleasant, \u2014 the party well assorted, \u2014 the locale enchanting. I was quite sorry when dusk came on, and the carriages were ordered lo return to town. How dusty, noisy, and vulgar the streets of London appeared, after fresh, dewy, delightful Hazlebank ! I met Mrs. Percy, afterwards, at Mrs. Harrington's ball ; who, when she heard that we had had neilher music, dancing, tumbling, nor syllabubs, at the duke's, exclaimed\u2014 \" Je vous sais mon compliment of your breakfast. I am really grateful to the duke for not involving me in so humdrum an affair.\" \u2014I am ashamed to admit how much I feel annoyed by this business with Lord Penrhyn. I never wished him to propose to me, or to have the renown of having refused him ; but quite as little did I wish him to assume Ihe tone of having refused me. His deportment at Almack's will, at all events, lead people to suppose lhat he resents the rumour of our marriage as arising from myself. Altogether, I am out of spi\u2014"], [262, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 86 rits. On Monday my sister leaves town for Bedfordshire, and, though I have been unable to persist in my attention of declining my pro jected visit, I cannot bear Ihe thoughts of parting with her, now I have ascertained from personal observation how uneasy is the life she leads wilh Herbert. In spile of his talents and good qualities, her at tachment must eventually give way under the influence of his detest able temper. Saturday. How strange !\u2014 I had agreed lo dine quietly at the Herberts' to-day, and, giving up the opera, to pass the evening wilh Armine. Their hour is seven, and I was punctual ; but my brother in-law was still out. Half-past seven, \u2014 eight, \u2014 half-past eight, \u2014 no Herbert! Armine grew horribly uneasy, for Henry is punctual lo a fault, and to a still greater fault exactive of punctuality in others. The buller came in twenty times to know if dinner was to be served; the children cried at being sent lo bed without kissing papa ; and al length Armine thought it would be civil to me to propose sitting down to dinner. As I oftener dine at nine this hot weather than at any other hour, of course I took pity on my poor sister's fidgetiness, and re fused. At last, as the clock of Park Street Chapel struck half-past nine, a knock al the door, and in came Mr. Herbert ; looking as cross as if he had lost half his fortune by a fall of the stocks. \"We fancied you had changed your mind, and were gone to dine at the club ; but Harriet would not hear of sitting down without you,\" said my sister, in a deprecating tone. \"She is very obliging. You had much better have dined. The dinner must be spoiled. I could have had a mutton-chop at a mi nute's notice.\" \" Oh, no ! much belter sit down all comfortably together. Dinner will be on the table in a moment. Have you washed your hands?\" \" Did you not hear me come straight inlo this room as I entered the house?\" \"Is any thing the matter?\" interposed I, stoutly ; \" has any thing occurred to annoy you?\" \" Nothing ! I was detained by business.\" \" Not disagreeable, I hope?\" \"When was business ever agreeable ?\" he replied, stalking out the room. Dinner was now announced; and, by the time the soup was cold, Herbert made his reappearance from his dressing-room ; refreshed by cold water, but slill cross. Only monosyllables were to be abstracted from him ; and, by the time he had helped us, in Ihe second course, to a green goose\u2014 done, not brown, but black\u2014 he relapsed into total silence. Armine and I, who had been talking together for three hours, had exhausted our gossip. We formed a charming family party. At"], [263, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 87 last, when dessert was on Ihe table, the servants withdrawn, and him self thrown back into his cogitalion chair, he suddenly burst forth into, \" A d \u2014 d, ugly, gormandizing egotist ! to risk his life against such a thing as that!\" and swallowed a glass of claret, as if to quench the burning particles of his indignation ; while Armine coloured crimson at the indecorum of his ejaculation. \" You are not aware that you are taking us into your confidence,\" said I, trying to turn the matter into jest. \" An ugly gormandizing egotist \u2014 must designate Mr. Hanton. \" Whose life you consider too precious to be risked against his, we are yet to learn.\" \" You have a wride scope for guessing. Scarcely a man about town but is worth the weight of ten such superficial asses as George Hanton.\" \"You seem to be in Ihe mood for calling names.\" \" I am suffering under great irritation. Hartston has been on the point of fighting George Hanton, and without doing me the honour of calling on me for advice; I, who have been his most intimate friend these ten years past.\" \" A- married man is not lightly to be involved in such affairs,\" said I : \"he showed his good taste. And how has the business ended ?\" \" Colonel Trevor acted as his second ; and it was the opinion of the club this morning, from something that feli from Trevor's brother, that a meeting must take place. No one knows the motive of the quarrel; they say some impertinent observation fell from Hanton, as they were riding together in the park, which Hartston required him to retract. Whatever it was, after much correspondence between the seconds, Hanton has fully retracted; but you may suppose that I could not return home till my doubts were set at rest. I am out of all patience with Hartston. What business had he to bring himself into contact with such a thing as Hanton ?\" \" I am sure I am thankful to him for not involving you in the affair,\" faltered Armine, with tears in her eyes. \" I had not thought it pos sible that my regard for him could have been heightened.\" \" How can two men, of pursuits and character so different, have possibly managed to quarrel ?\" said I, unwilling to admit all the interest I felt in the subject. \" Pursuit I what pursuits has George Hanton but those of stuffing and gambling ? To see such an animal affect the epicure !\u2014 scarcely finding an ortolan or a partridge delicate enough for the nutriment of a body which a hungry wolf would not deign to feed upon !\" In short, Herbert could scarcely find words to express his indigna tion ; and, partly to get rid of his violence, partly in hopes to gratify my curiosity touching the cause of a duel which cannot fail to be much talked of, I altered my determination about the opera, sent for the carriage, and departed. But, on ariving at my box, I found myself"], [264, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE, 88 de trop. I forgot having announced to Cecilia my determination not to go ; and she had taken with her Madame di Campo Fiorito, who does not \"take wilh her,\" bul is invariably \"followed by\" a sort of triple shadow, a cerberus of certain three dandies, who, wilh the two ladies, completely filled our cozy little box. Of course, I would not hear of disturbing them ;\u2014 assured Lady Cecilia I had twenty seats at my dis posal, and withdrew in all possible haste, \u2014 secretly determined to go home. As 1 stood waiting for my carriage, however, the Duke of Merioneth came in from some royal dinner-parly, and stopped to say lon soir, en passant. On learning my dilemma, he would not admit of my losing the last act of the new ballet, but insisted on my accom panying him to his box, which is nearly the best in the house ; when I enjoyed, more than I had ever done before, the dancing of the Ta glioni. I could not resist my inclination to question him about the duel, of which he had not heard a syllable ; and seemed to feel the matter as warmly as Herbert. He promised me to go the Travellers' after the opera, and call on me to-morrow. I am afraid he will not get here before three o'clock . What could Lord Hartston and George Hanton find to fight about ? \u2014 I, who am never visible to visitors on Sunday mornings, desired to-day that every one might be admitted, in order to avoid the gau cherie of giving an exclusive order for the duke. The consequence is, that, from two o'clock till six, my rooms have been filled with all the bores in town, while his.Grace has not made his appearance! Per haps the appointment was mere facon deparler, and he never meant to come. Had I not been pre-engrossed by the subject of the duel, I should have been at once shocked and amused by a scene which occurred here an hour ago. Lord Hilton and Lady Buntingford were sitting with me, arranging the a quand of a little ball he wants to give on board his yacht at Woolwich, of which he has asked me to do the honours ; when in walked Count Szchazoklwonski, whom, though always wild and reckless, I never yet saw in such a state of perturbation. \" A thousand excuses, dear Madame Delafals,\" said he, \" but (sans vous interrompre) what was it the family lives next house to you ; and what name was it, the confounded rascals which was paying him a visit just now?\" \" A showy-looking foreigner in a showy-looking cabriolet?\" said I, readily comprehending that he alluded to the daily suitor of Miss Au gusta Gresham Ronsham. \"A beast-looking foreigner, in a beast-looking cab,\" cried Ihe count, with indignation. \" I beseech you what calls he himself?\" \"I am sorry I cannot inform you,\" said I ; \" I am equally unac quainted wilh my neighbours and their guests.\""], [265, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 89 \" If you mean a tall handsome Transylvanian, who goes about wilh the Gresham Ronshams,\" observed Lady Huntingford, \" his name is something like Schwarlzkywhich. They asked leave to bring him to my ball, but my list was full, and I declined.\" \" Do you not mean Count Schwarzkiewicz?\" inquired Lord Hilton. \" He is a friend of Lancaster's and Sir Jervis Hall's ; and they are try ing to get him in at the Travellers'. A deuced knowing fellow about horses. They tell me he has a breeding stud in the Ukraine, which furnishes half the Austrian cavalry.\" \" A pitiful rascals, \u2014 a disgusting impostors ! \" cried Szchazoklwon ski, in a still greater fury. \"Unless my eyes strange ways deceive me, 'lisa runaway hayduck of my father's, which was severely flogged for stealing ; and which would have been sent to the ranks to mend his moral, had he not took French furlough, and made off from Hun gam.\" \" You must be mistaken, my dear fellow ! \u2014 you must be mistaken !\" exclaimed Lord Hilton. \"Schwarzkiewicz brought excellent letters here from Paris, \u2014 he is very well in society. I don't know him per sonally, but I have heard him highly spoken of by all our fellows.\" \"No such tings ! \\ exclaimed Szchazoklwonski, out of all patience; \" 'tis a kerl, a vagabonds, \u2014 vat you calls a blackguards !\" \"Be cautious, be cautious!\" cried Hilton; \"make sure of your man before you persist in Ihe charge. TVhere did yofl see him ? when! \" \" I caught a glance as he step from his cab into the house who is next from this.\" . \"Mr. Gresham Ronsham's, of Wrangham Hall\u2014 a highly respect able family,\" interposed Lady Bunlingford. \" May be or not,\" cried the count. Mr. Creeshing Ronshing has a swindlers in his apartments at tis fery minutes ! \" \"Could not your friend make sure of the fact,\" observed the more prudent Lady Bunlingford, \" by remaining here till the count's depar ture, and watching him into the carriage?\" \" Certainly if you think it worlh while,\" said I, addressing the count. \" It is more than worth while ! it is a duty to relieve society of an impostor,\" observed Lord Hilton. \"Since Ihe question has been raised, and since I know Schwarzkiewicz lo be on the eve of admis sion into the Travellers', /, for my own satisfaction, entreat you not to leave the business in doubt.\" \" My book-room commands a view of Mr. Gresham Ronsham's door,\" said I ; \" if you like to take up your station there, you cannot fail to see Ihe exit of the count.\" \"No, no; I would incosthim face to face, for more demonstrations!\""], [266, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 90 cried the angry count. \" I shall walk up and downs the Place till he shall pass.\" \" Give me leave to accompany you,\" said Lord Hilton. \" I shall not be sorry lo witness the scene, and you may require testimony of what passes. Allons !\" \" You will not have long to wait,\" I observed, as they took leave. \" My neighbours are always early at the Zoological on Sundays, \u2014 al ways first and last al every public place. Il is already four. They will soon be on Ihe wing.\" \" Pray, let me remain with you till the scene is over,\" said Lady Bunlingford: \" I am dying to know how it ends. I have always told lhat foolish woman, my friend Mrs. Ronsham, that, for the molher of a family, she is much too general in her acquaintance. I have no doubt this count will turn out a swindler ; and then the prospecls of that unfortunate girl, Augusta, are ruined for life. Do let us come into your book-room.\" The moment we entered the door, loud angry voices, under the window, convinced us Ihe scene was already in progress; and, looking out, we perceived Count Szchazoklwonski collaring the infuriated Schwarzkiewicz; while Lord Hilton kept back the interference of the footmen of Mr. Gresham Ronsham, whose whole establishment, \" foolish fat scullion and all,\" was assembled on the door-steps. At last, I was vexed to see my friend, Szchazoklwonski, inflict several blows wilh his cane on the shoulders of his antagonist ; readily antici pating what followed, lhat the interference of the police would be called in by some officious bystander. \" They be only soreigneerers,\" said a man in a light porter's jacket. \" Dang un, let 'un foight it out.\" The police thought otherwise. Both were taken into custody ; when Szchazoklwonski, addressing the German groom in wailing wilh his tilbury, bade him drive off to the Austrian Embassy, and bring his two friends, Count Dietrichstein and Prince Lichtenstein, to meet him at the office. The moment this order was given, to the surprise of all present, the soi-disant Count Schwarzkiewicz, who had hitherto been as magnanimous as le brave Dunois, fell whimpering on his knees upon the pavement, imploring the count lo let him off: but Szchazoklwonski was inflexible; gave him anew in charge as a swindler, and proceeded to meet him in Marlborough Street. St. James's Place is, luckily, so quiet a situation, that but a moderate mob was collected to witness this strange affair; or to hear the shriek (piercing as lhat of Parisina) wilh which, from her bower-window, Miss Augusta Gresham Ronsham witnessed the recreancy of the delinquent. So soon as the street was cleared, Lady Bunlingford proceeded, at my suggestion, to enlighten the mind of \" that foolish woman, her"], [267, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 91 friend, Mrs. Ronsham,\" touching the mysteries of the day. I suspect she succeeded in persuading the family that it would be better to put an unconscious face upon the business; for, in the course of an hour, the family coach came round, and away Ihey rumbled a I'ordinaire into the Park; the carriage displaying only sour pink salin bonnets, instead of sive. Miss Augusta remained at home, weeping outher lender sorrows. About six o'clock, I received a few apologizing lines from the duke, staling that he had been unavoidably detained by the arrival of his mother, to pass the day wilh him ; and informing me, that nolhing was known of the quarrel between his friend and Mr. Hanton, further lhan (hat the affair was at an end. \u2014 At seven, the Herberts dined wilh me ; my brother in high spirits at the prospect of quilting town, and Armine quietly happy, be cause she saw her husband so. Immediately after dinner, I pro posed a drive in the open carriage on the Harrow road, the prettiest, but least frequented of the suburbs ; and, while enjoying Ihe cool of the evening, and gossipping of this and lhat, Lord Hartston and his duel againcame upon Ihe tapis. In the openness of my heart, I indiscreetly observed, that I believed Hanton capable of any degree of insolence \u2014 that his conduct towards myself \u2014 I paused, but it was too late. Herbert would not let me rest, till I had explained every particular of the pro posal and the leiter. \" By heavens ! I clearly understand it now 1\" cried he. \" The in fernal ass, no doubt, hazarded to Hartston some impertinent comment upon your conduct; andllarlslon, impelled by Ihe foolish preference he is still absurd enough to indulge, and, knowing you had neither hus band, father, nor brother, to defend you, though sit to resent it! As if the duty did not belong to me ! As if it were not my place to vindi cate the reputation of my sister-in-law ! I must have a serious expla nation with him ; I must know the truth.\" \"But you have not the slightest grounds for your supposition,\" said I, really alarmed. \" There are a thousand, a million of topics, on which they may have disagreed.\" \"No, no, nol From one or two hints I gathered from Colonel Trevor, who was eager to put an end to my investigation, I am convinced that you, and you only, were the cause of the dispute.\" \"At all events,' interposed Armine, \" the affair is now at rest ; and it would be very unfair to my sister to renew the publicity of what must be painful, and may be injurious to her.\" \" Injurious to her !\" cried Herbert, losing all command of himself ; \"I declare to you, Harriet, that for a woman endowed wilh com mon sense, I look upon you as worse than inexcusable.

It is now more than ten years since I sirst becameacquaint ed wilh you ; and, from that time, I have scarcely ever seen you con duct yourself like a reasonable being.\" \" Thank you,\" said I, trying, at least, to retain the commandos my own temper. \"No; don't think to silence me by a woman's flippant retort! I will tell you the truth, and you shall hear it. Think of all the evil you have heaped on your own head! Because lhat fellow, Delaval, swore you were an angel at your first race-ball, and looked well at the head of his regiment on a field-day, you accepted his proposals. You were assured by your friends, that he was a violent man \u2014 a man of inferior education ; yet you ventured to give him your hand, and fix yourself for life in one of the most wretched districts in Ireland. Re flect on what he became there ! Reflect on what you suffered under the tyranny of a brute \u2014 a sot!'\" \"Slay!\" cried I. \"With myself you are at liberty to deal as harshly as you please. Colonel Delaval is no more. His name is sacred.\" \"So far you may be right,\" replied Herbert, in a milder tone. \" Of him I have no right to speak; but of yourself, Harriet, I must and will. You returned among us, having suffered much, and little profiled by your sufferings; but young, honoured, wealthy, rich in all that ought to have secured your happiness. What have you done to improve these blessings ? Branded yourself with fashionable notoriety, and rendered your name as familiar in the mouths of the puppies of the clubs, as (hose of the vile and worthless. One of the first men in this kingdom was disposed to make you his wife, and elevate you to a position which even the most ambitious of your vain associates have gloried in allaining.

But this is not all. You have exposed yourself to a thousand slights. Penrhyn's insolence (thanks to your friends, the Lancasters and Percies) has raised a general laugh at your expense; yet, apparently unsatisfied wilh the extent of your incautions, only last night you chose to thrust yourself upon the notice of the public, tete-a-tete wilh the Duke of Merioneth, in order that the Sunday prints might hold you up to ridicule as they have done this day, as ' the dashing Irish widow, who is venturing a bold cast of the net for ;' but why should I repeat such trash! or, rather, why should such inuendoes have been levelled ak the daughter of General Montresor 1\""], [269, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 93 I was too much agitated for any attempt to interrrupt or appease him. While he was speaking, dearest Armine, unable to repress her tears, took my hand in hers, and pressed it tenderly, as if bespeaking my forbearance towards her husband. But her appeal was needless. I could not be angry with Herbert. Every word he uttered was dic tated by the best intentions, \u2014 by the warmest interest in my welfare, I trust he exaggerates my errors. I trust he is deceived. I * * * * * * Monday, Is..\u2014 I woke this morning with a dreadful headach ; partly caused by reflections on Herbert's remonstrances; partly by the knowledge that Armine and the children were already some twenty miles on their road into Bedfordshire. However, I have promised to visit them at Hollybridge early in Ihe autumn. Monday, 8th. \u2014 A whole week elapsed, and not a word in my diary. Since Herbert's rough apostrophe, or, perhaps I should say, since Herbert's harsh administration of wholesome truths, I have dreaded to record my own observations, seeing how completely I have suffered myself to become a dupe lo the flatterers of the world. I misdoubt myself, \u2014 I misdoubt others. I would have quilted town the very day of Armine's departure, but that such a precipitate retreat would have been instantly traced by the malicious to its true motive, mortification. I am grown listless, \u2014 morose. People ask if I am ill ; and suggest this remedy and that ; as they do to languid fine ladies, sickening under the fatigues ofthe season, and the vexation of its termination. Most families, unshackled by the claims of parliament, or the re sponsibilities of supreme fashion, have already quitted town. London is more close, more dusty, more disagreeable lhan I could have sup posed possible. The once green park under my windows is now of a tawny yellow; and water-carts and Grange's currant-ice alone pre serve the men and beasts, who still frequent it, from being carbonized in the course of their morning's amusements. Is it not one of the strangest abuses of this fox-hunling kingdom, that winter is to be spent in the country, and summer in town? What a meritorious achieve ment would it be for the reign of Victoria I. to cause the extermi nation of foxes, like that of the wolves of yore, by exacting an annual tribute of so many thousands heads ! thus enabling Ihe legislative lords of the creation to assemble between November and May ; and ils ladies to enjoy their parks and flower-gardens, when the rose is on the bush, and the daisy in the grass. As it is, we denizens of the scorching metropolis seem lo pass the dog-days in rushing forth to Ihis suburb and to that, gasping after fresh air. To-day, a dejeuner at Highgate ; to-morrow a gipsy party to Finchley ; with fish dinners in taverns, savouring of punch, tobacco, Thames mud, and fried flounders ; or venison dinners at the Star and"], [270, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 94 Garter, for Ihe supplementary enjoyment of a dusty drive. Old Lady Burlington and Mrs. Crowhurst, the Lancasters and Percies, exclaim, every lime I meet them , \" Is not London charming, now all the people are gone? It is like ecarte after long whist 1\" For my part I find it resemble only the last tedious dragging repetition of a waltz played by a musical snuff-box, of which Ihe main spring is run down. The thing wants winding up. The other day we were a little enlivened by the novelly of Lord Hilton's ball. Those especially invited, myself among the number, left Westminster Bridge about four o'clock in the Admiralty barge; wilh a brass-band allending, lo oulbray the strange tumults of the river ; and wilh little Count Alfred de la Vauguyon (a walking Del croix's shop) lo out-essence its mauvaises odeurs. The river looked of a dingy copper colour ; and the steeples of the city, and engine chimneys of the borough \u2014 nay, even the masls ofthe shipping in the docks, seemed to lose themselves in the haze of an atmosphere worthy the coast of Guinea, or the canvass of some Martinian pandemonium. We arrived at the inn at Woolwich, where sive-and-lwenty were in vited to dine, in a state worthy to have been garnished with fried parsley and served among the fritures. While-bait ought not to tempt any thing less lhan an alderman into such superfluous exertions in such weather. The ball was prettily managed, and the yacht beautifully illuminated ; but it strikes me we should have danced quite as much to our own sa tisfaction in Lord Hilton's mansion in Berkley Square. I accompanied Lady Cecilia back. I am careful now to avoid being in my own car riage with a vacant seat to be encroached upon by some impertinent lounger. The most amusing person of the party was Madame di Campo Fiorito. Deeply penetrated with the notion of the nautical glories of England, and the \" rule\" which lhat lin-helmeted Amazon Britannia assumes lo herself over ihe waves, she seemed to fancy that our marine supremacy must commence at London Bridge ; she saw a seventy-four in every Wesl-Indiaman, \u2014 a frigate in every Dogger bank cod-schuyt, \u2014 and a tar under the jacket of every jolly young waterman. Her ejaculations at the sight of Greenwich Hospital, and ils wooden-legged Tom Toughs, were quite Delia Cruscan ; and greatly did she applaud Ihe magnanimity of our English sovereigns in having, as she concluded, resigned Iheir own palace as a shelter for the veterans of iheir fleets, and contented themselves wilh Ihe tumble-down alms house of St. James's. The yatch, too, enchanted her ; and she en chanted us in her turn by the description of a fete she had witnessed in childhood, given lo Josephine in the Bay of Genoa, by the Ligurian republic ; when hundreds of orange-lrees in blossom were embarked in boats, and towed around the barge containing Ihe wife of the hero"], [271, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 95 of Marengo ; an idea sar more elegant, in my opinion, than the tinsel glories of Cleopatra's Gallery, wilh ils purple brocades and painted Cupids. Lady Southam, who leaves town to-morrow, is anxious that I should accompany her to Southam Castle; and there are few women for the sake of whose society I would more willingly make a sacrifice. But I have promised Lady Cecilia to remain here till something de finitive is settled about poor Clarence. How is it I have managed to see so little of Isabella Southam during her stay in town? With the exception ofa dinner here, and one at her own house, we have scarce ly met. Such is the enlrainement of fashion in London society, lhat persons entertaining a sincere friendship for each other, and living only at a few streets' distance, if engaged in different sets, content the claims of their mutual regard by now and then a formal dinner party, at which they are unable to exchange six words of conversation. Isabella belongs to a sober caste, and seems bigoted to the rationalilics of the present court; \u2014 is constant to the Ancient Music, \u2014 curious about exhibitions and picture auctions, \u2014 takes her children half-a dozen limes in Ihe season to the British Museum and Longman's cata combs of learning, and eschews a circulating library as she would a masquerade warehouse. Wise in her generation, she will meet her reward; but, foolish as I am in mine, she will not meet me. I wish I had courage to disentangle myself from the webs of filmy gossamer, which I have suffered lo sold and enfold me, till they have become potent as chains of mail. But it is too late. I have not once seen the Duke of Merioneth since the newspapers thought proper to couple his name with mine. He called here the other day; but at the hour when 1 was certain to be out : for I con tinue my daily rides with Lady Alicia and her father, \u2014 often ex tending them as far as Roehampton, or Richmond. The King and Queen go to Windsor next week, and I shall consequently lose tbe Clackmannans. Previously to the Penrhyn affair, I had become veiy intimate with the Rossanas, whom I particularly like: but, not choosing to put myself in the way of his solemn salutations, I have gradually receded from their set. It amuses me, now the gaieties of the season have subsided, to observe divers persons and coteries re ascending into importance, who, during the crush of June, were for gotten. Lady Kent's card-parties are once more frequented ; and Lady William Balely's, once more recherche's. The placard of \" to let furnished,\" is posted anew in the dusty windows of the family mansion, erewhile the scene of poor Augusta Gresham Ronsham's sentimenta lities; and I noticed, that it required a supplementary baggage-waggon, inscribed wilh Ihe name of \" Tanaquil Gresham Ronsham, Esq. Wran\"ham Park, Hunts,\" to convey into the country ihe additional"], [272, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 96 trunks, boxes, and cases containing the paraphernalia of their disastrous London compaign. The exeunt omnes of the family wore a most dispi- riting aspect. The elder girls, like the coach-horses, looked worn to their last legs; Ihe younger ones had been backboarded, melronomed, and mazurk'd into a most cadaverous complexion ; and the meagre baby, with its pinched blue nose, seemed victimized by a course of calomel and a daily apothecary. Lady Bunlingford informs me she suggested a couple of months at Leamington for the general restoration of the family ; but that papa, after due discharge of his bills of the season, was begin- ning to talk of the hardness of the times, and the reduction of his rent- roll ; while mamma was of opinion, that the less they appeared in public the better, till Stanislas Ruprecht Schmidt (alias Count Schwarz kiewicz) should be duly released from the tread-mill, and on board the Hamburgh steamer. i' Yes ! I shall soon be at liberty. The Clarence crisis is approach ing. I have just received a P. P.C. from the Mardynvilles, \u2014 an un failing signal lhat the Court, and consequently the Clackmannans, are on the move for Windsor. , En attendant, one of the French princes has arrived ; and as so few persons remain in town who are in a position to entertain him, the Duke of Merioneth has determined to give a farewell ball to-morrow, in honour of his royal highness; the last fete of Ihe season, but proba bly one of the most brilliant! The last! Weary as I am of this eternal circle of frivolity, \u2014 this day without a night, \u2014 this year without a winter, \u2014 the idea that lam about lo say farewell to so many intimate associates, \u2014 to part, for a period of eight months, and perhaps for ever, from so many who have been kind lo me, fills my mind wilh melancholy forebodings. Inde pendence, too, is a fine thing ; but the bird that soars highest, and sings loudest in honour of the joys of liberty, still keeps in view the little nest to which, when weary of the wing, it can return for shelter; while I, who have \" the world before me, where to choose my place of rest,\" tremble at the wideness of my prospects, and Ihe knowledge of my own irresponsibility. I may travel where I will, \u2014 abroad,\u2014 at home; seek what company I list, good, bad, or indifferent; and no one has a right to call in question my comings, or my goings. No one cares whether I injure my reputation, \u2014 whether I squander my for tune. Armine is wrapt up in her husband and children ; Herbert in himself. Even the reprimand he lately addressed me arose from the danger in which he supposed me to have involved his friend, more than from interest in my own welfare. Were I to set forth on a lour to the Continent, and indulge my own vagrant devices, until next spring, I verily believe that not a creature would inquire, \" What has become of Mrs. Delaval?\" unless, perhaps, Lady Cecilia, during the"], [273, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 97 intervals of her hearlquakes about her son ! \u2014 Dispiriting reflexion ! \u2014 Rude e'cole \u25a0' \u2014 I know not whether my misanthropic doom of yesterday had written strange defeatures in my face; but, when I entered the ball room at Merioneth House last night, several persons accosted me with the inquiry, \" Pry thee, why so pale?\" which is sure to answer itself, by bringing blushes to Ihe cheek. Certes, it was no time or place for tristesse. Beautiful as the fetes there always are, this was surpassing. The encoignures of Ihe room were silled with pyramidal jardinieres reaching to the ceiling, and containing nothing but roses. Every nursery-ground near London must have been despoiled; for there were many hundred varieties ; some of the choicest kind. It was li terally \" the feast of roses ;\" and Moore, who was present, must have felt himself in an eighlh heaven of his own creation ! In honour of the young prince (of whose grand-uncle, the Emperor Leopold, she was formerly the intimate friend), the Duchess of Me rioneth for once presided over a fete given by her son; and queenly, indeed, she looked. It struck me, that her deportment, as a noble matron, and that of the Due deN., as a prince du sang, were alike the perfection of high breeding. They talked for some lime together ; and, formal as such entretiens needs must be, there was none of the re straint between Ihem which would have led some vulgar dowager to observe, \" What could I sind to say to a boy?\" or some gawky lord ling to complain, \" What the d \u2014 1 could I talk of to an old woman?\" I was rather curious, and perhaps a little anxious, to ascertain whe ther the reports in circulation would produce any change in his Grace's manners towards myself. But my inquietudes were quite su perfluous. I might have known, that there was nothing of the Pen rhyn, nothing of the Hanton, in his kind and noble nature. He re ceived me more warmly than he had ever done before. The duchess found a place forme to sit near her; and at supper, I was the only untitled person lo whom a place was assigned at the table prepared for the Due de Nemours. Lord Lancaster mentioned accidentally, when I met him the previous day at the British Gallery, lhat George Hanton was furious at not being invited ; and I am convinced, from an obser vation made to me by the duke, that the omission was intentional, and a compliment to me. I certainly do feel happier in houses where I am secure from the spectacle of his self-complacent ugliness. In Ihe midst ofthe ball, Mrs. Percy, perceiving me to be in fashion, took my arm, and coaxed me away into one of the half-empty drawing-rooms, much to my discomposure; for there sat Lady Clack mannan in violent disputation with Clarence, and I would not for the world have appeared to take note of what was going on between them."], [274, "DIARY OF A D-.SENNUYEE. 98 \"I congratulate you, my dear creature,\" whispered Mrs. Percy, after having planted me on one of the ottomans, and herself by my side ; \"he is gone, \u2014 actually gone 1\" I turned towards her wilh wondering eyes; \" To whom do you allude?'' being plainly inscribed in the expression of my face. \" Penrhyn,\u2014 Lord Penrhyn,\" she replied, carefully examining what effect the mention of that cabalistic name might produce in my countenance. \"Refused in form by the Rossanas, and so much to his astonishment, lhat he quilted town within four-and-twenty hours, afler writing to put off all the people he had invited for August to Penrhyn Hall for grouse-shooting. The Courier of this evening states, that he has ordered his yacht to prepare sor a cruise in Ihe Mediterranean.\" \" I trust Lord Penrhyn will amuse himself,\" said I. \" He has long ceased to amuse me.\" \" Oh 1 as to you,\" cried Mrs. Percy, \" his conduct was absolutely unpardonable. I told every one, at the time, that I considered it infamous. However, there were people about him \u2014 George Hanton and the Lancaslers \u2014 who thought it clever lo put him up to a tone likely to pique you.\" \" They must have been grievously disappointed to find me so in different on the subject.\" \" Of course we were all aware you must be annoyed ; but we did honour lo your self-command in seeming to take it so coolly.\" \" More honour than I deserved. I may have been unconscious of insults deliberately prepared by others, and, therefore, to them most evident.\" \" Why, really, my dear soul,\" she was conlinuing ; but at that mo ment the duke, evidently in search of me, approached, to mention his mother's request lhat I would join her supper-table with the royal party; and, accepting his offered arm, I was not sorry to leave Mrs. Percy to her malicious man\u0153uvres. After supper, the duke, for the first and only lime during the evening, joined the dancers, inviting me to be his partner in a waltz; on the conclusion of which, leading me lo one of Ihe jardinieres, he plucked an exquisite white and yellow union rose, the object of general admiration throughout the evening, and pre sented it to me. I saw many envious eyes fixed upon me, and, after the mortifications I have recently experienced, could not help seeling a flush of feminine triumph at being thus singled out by a person singled out by the whole of London. Lord Hartston had just entered the room as I received my beautiful bouquet, and I determined to retire wilh my laurels and my rose unwithered. Having already asked for my car riage, I withdrew as precipitately as Cinderella. \u2014 This morning, I was sent for at an early hour, to Ladv Cecilia,"], [275, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 99 whom I found half in hysterics, wholly in despair. Lady Clackman nan's explanations last night with Clarence seem to have been decisive. She has forbidden all further intercourse between the cousins ; and, instead of following the court to Windsor, leaves the marquess lo his official duties, and actually sets off wilh Alicia this very day for Scotland. Clarence fancies himself ill-used; although Lady C. has acted only as any other parent would have done in her situalion ; yet I had some difficulty in preventing Cecilia from writing to her sister one of those angry letters which create an irreparable breach. Women in a passion should begin by throwing into the sire their pensahd paper : as much mischief has been done in the world by hasty letters, as by Ihe discoVery of gunpowder. Made my adieus lo-night to the opera ; \u2014 a melancholy spectacle. The house almost empty, \u2014 half the boxes not wholly deserted, being silled wilh problematical. Il really oppressed me to note the loss of. so many of the charming faces on which I have been gazing for the last four months, till they seemed inseparable from the place ; nor had I patience lo look down on the empty benches of the pit, and de serted fops-alley, where only three weeks ago every face was de connaissance. With the exception of some thirty men who, I fancy, never quit London, the desecrated space was silled by haberdashers' apprentices and butlers out of place ! I have just answered a press ing letter of invitation which I received yesterday from Armine, pro mising tobe at Hollybridge next week. Apres \u2014 I trust the stars have me in Iheir keeping ; for projects I have none, \u2014 alors, comme alorsl \u2014 To increase my depression at the moment of parting with so many friends, I have accidentally been witness to a most painful, or, per haps, I ought to say, a most impressive scene. On visiting my coa turiere, to execute a commission for one of my Irish friends, I found the good woman's aspect so doleful lhat I could not help making in quiries. Her venerable inmate, she said, was upon his death-bed 1 \"Mr. Forster rallied for a time, poor genlleman, under Ihe excite ment produced by your generous offices,\" continued Mrs. Hemstitch : \"and we were in hopes of getting him into the country : but the very heart within him seems to have been worn away by years of trouble ; the vital powers were gone, and, for the last three days, he has been rapidly sinking. He knows that his time is come, \u2014 is resigned and tranquil ; for your generosity, madam, has secured the welfare of his children. I cannot express the difference in his feelings now and a month ago. Then, it was dreadful to see him shrink from the approach of death ; now, his frame of mind is as it should be. Ofone thing he has long been earnestly desirous, poor soul ;\u2014 he wants lo thank and bless his benefactress. But we have put him off with pretexts of your being absent from town ; for, of course, madam, I felt the impossibility 7*"], [276, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 100 of asking a great lady and a gay lady like yourself to visit a dying man in the attic of one of your tradespeople.\" \" If you think my presence would afford him the smallest satisfac tion,\" said I, \" even now, at the eleventh hour, I will gladly accede to his wish.\" And I own I was in hopes of hearing my offer declined, for I did not feel myself to be in a slate of preparation for such a scene. \" If you would so far condescend,\" said Mrs. Hemstitch, eagerly; and, without further deliberation, I removed from my head the gaudy bonnet and plumes so unsuitable to the nature of my visit, and follow ed my blunt but good Samaritan up a dark staircase to a door, at which she tapped gently; and, after a little whispering with the nurse, beckoned me in. The deathlike stillness of lhat little chamber scarcely induced tho belief that four persons were its inmates; but the son and daughter were kneeling on either side the bed \u2014 Iheir very tears falling silently, lest they should disturb the last moments of the dying man. As I looked upon the white head scarcely distinguishable from the pillow on which it lay, and remembered that it was blanched less by years than by affliction (the humiliating affliction of poverty, which might have been so readily relieved), my heart grew faint wilh a sudden consciousness of the responsibilities of the wealthy. The old man's eyes were dim, but his lips moved as though absorbed in in ward prayer. Feeling that it was now too late to afford him pleasure by my visit, I was about to withdraw from the room ; when the move ment attracted his attention, and, turning his languid eyes towards me, he seemed in a moment to understand the motive of my presence. His countenance brightened. Feebly raising his thin hand from the coverlid, he extended it towards me ; and, having pressed mine wilh a grasp of fervour, and an earnest expression of face which I shall not easily forget, placed it in benediction on the head of his girl, whose sobs were stifled in the bed-clothes, and extended the other interced ingly lo Heaven. In another minute the upraised hand fell back re laxed upon the sheet, and the eyes of the grateful father were already fixed in death. \u2014 His labours were over \u2014 his privations ended \u2014 his days of darkness brightened inlo eternal light ! There is comfort to me in the thought, that, useless as is my career of life, in this instance I have had the happiness of contributing to the comfort of a suffering fellow-creature. But was the good deed oimy seeking? Was it not almost forced upon me by the superior virtue of one, so placed in the scale of society lhat she ought lo have received her example of charity from me! Alas ! my own merit in the affair is insignificant indeed. \u2014Lady Cecilia is just now in one of her unreasonable fits of ner-"], [277, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 101 vousness ; and poor Sir Jenison has a happy prospect in the month of conjugal felicity they are about to pass at Cowes. She had settled it wilh herself lhat I should accompany her, and lhat we were to have yachting parties, regalias, and I know not what;] and cannot pardon me for preferring Bedfordshire. But I feel the want of quiet, and of my sister's society; and, even were I not resolved upon visiting the Herberts, Cowes is the last place I should have preferred, as I find Lord Penrhyn is amusing himself in the Isle of Wight, having already plucked off his Rossana willow. Hollybridge, Beds. \u2014 What a pleasant sensation, after the tumults and heartburnings of a season in town, to be awakened by the song of birds, from a tranquillizing night's rest ! How beautifully green ap pears the verdure of the paddock under my windows, and the coppice towards which it slopes, after the dingy Green Park, and the dusty groves of Buckingham Palace ! How fresh, how fragrant the air here, after Ihe stifling atmosphere of London ! I fancied lhat the recent dispiritment of my mind arose from regret at the idea of leaving town ; but, no sooner we're Ihe chains of habit broken, and I found myself ensconced in my travelling carriage, than I felt relieved from the pressure of a thousand imaginary evils. I am delighted to find my self here. Armine and the children have recovered their good looks and good spirits, and received me at the gate, all bloom and cheerfulness; even Herbert seems to be quite a different creature here in his little domain. The place is a thousand times prettier lhan I expected; and, though \" a cottage of gentility,\" its pride does not even pretend to be humble. There is a pretty green-house attached to the drawing-room ; and the gardens are good and extensive for the size of the domain. The windows command an animated landscape ; the book-room is well furnished ; altogether, there is an air of cheerfulness which fully ex plains my brother's distate for the smoky house in New Norfolk Street. Hollybridge is a home thai seems to invite one to be happy. It appears an established rule in country neighbourhoods, that the moment a friend or relative arrives on a visit, all Ihe surrounding families shall confederate to interrupt their enjoyment of each other's society. For three days only was I permitted to be alone wilh my sister and her rosy children. On the fourth came Lady Farrington, of Farrington Park, full of reproaches to Armine, lhat she had not more immediately apprised her of dear Mrs. Delaval's arrival ; and insisting lhat an early day should be fixed for a visit to Sir John and herself. Supposing that the word \" visit\" purported only a formal full-dress dinner party, to be purchased by a drive of sive or six miles, I still attempted to telegraph lo my sister an entreaty that the project"], [278, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 102 might be negatived. But Lady Farrington was there only to enforce her demand; and we found it impossible to deny that no pre-en gagement prevented our accepting her invitation for Thursday, the se cond of August. The knolty point thus adjusted, she withdrew ; but what was my consternation on learning from Armine that the neigh bourhood of Hollybridge is what is called \" acharming sociable neigh bourhood;\" .. e. one of those in which it is decreed, that those who dine must sleep, and that those who dine and sleep, extend the penance to eight-and-sorty hours. We have, therefore, impending over us, a visit of two days to fussy, empty, parading Lady Farrington. But this is not my only grievance. She appears to have made a round of vi sitations for Ihe sole purpose of circulating through the country (he arrival of Mrs. Herbert's sister ; the following day, our pretty little drawing-room was crowded with all the visitables within eight miles distance of Hollybridge. I now admit lhat I was inhuman in my verdict, that quiet country families, such as the Gresham Ronshams and Farringlons, were better at their country seats than amid the fashionable corruptions of London. I did not know, or had forgotten, the stupifying triviality ofa sociable, gossipping country neighbourhood. Amongst the! five detachments of fiddle-saddlers who yesterday bestowed their tediousness upon Hollybridge, exactly three topics of conversation were started ; thecom miltal ofone Phil. Robinson by a certain worshipful 'Squire Smilh, on a charge of having poisoned a sox-cover ; \u2014 the probability that Sir Thomas Elliot, Ihe high-sheriff, would start a new carriage for the ap proaching assizes; and the injustice ofa bill passed last session, for turning the road between Gorse Hill and Broomby Bottom, so as lo secure Lord Forcefig's wall-fruit from thedust. On these three nothing nesses did they ring the changes; arguing, re-arguing, swallowing their own arguments ; misapprehending, and apologizing for their own stupidity ; misrepresenting, and sneaking out of their own equivocations, till I scarcely wondered lhat poor Miss Augusta Gresham Ronsham should have been captivated by the sine, gay, bold-faced villany ofa Count Schwarzkiewicz, with his man-of-the- world-like diversity of small talk. No pismire, domesticated in ils ant-hill, can entertain a narrower view of life and manners lhan two-thirds of Armine's country neighbours; valuable people, no doubt, in their generation ( \" bien heureux les pauvrcs d'esprit'), but tedious beyond all patience, save that ot my gentle amiable sister. I have been trying to persuade Ar- mine to remove our work-table and books to-morrow into a delightful grove of lime-trees, a few hundred yards from the house ; but the earnestness wilh which she pleaded\u2014\" Still we must receive our vi sitors; they are kind friendly people; and, you know, it would be im possible to say, ' not at home,' to those who come several miles, only"], [279, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 103 lo show us attention,\" was unanswerable. It seemed any thing but impossible to me ; but Armine knows best. \u2014 Farrington Park! Farrington Park! \u2014 what a type of antedilu vianism ! \u2014 nothing wanting but the ponderous coach-and-six, wilh gilt springs, to represent the family establishment of all the Grandisons, A great gloomy slate drawing-room, without a flower, a book, or a com fortable chair to muse in; a great state dining-room, wilh portraits of all variety of badness, in oils and crayons, of Farringtons of the three last reigns, ending with Sir John, M.P., painted at the expense of the corporation of Bedford, in a William-Pitt-like attitude, with a business like standish and corporation rolls on his writing table ; a great stale bil liard-room, with a table of the last century, its green cloth like my own Green Park, faded into autumnal yellow ; a great state staircase, and suite of great state bed-rooms, wilh great state four- post beds, of dusty damask; and a great state Dutch flower-garden, three quarters of a mile from the hall door! Every thing, in short, to secure the discom fort of its inmates. Herbert groaned aloud, as we drove up to the por tico; while Armine felt it her duty to console him by Ihe observation, that, however disagreeable the visit, he would be able to get through a great deal of justice-business with Sir John, in Ihe course of the next twodavs. Lady Farrington welcomed us with the hospitable fervour of an Arab. \" I expect a charming party!\" said she. \" In addition to Sir Thomas Clargess' family, we have Sir Robert and Lady Mardynville, who are coming from Berkshire to pass a week with us; very fashion able people, who live on the most intimate terms with the royal family. Perhaps you may have met them in town?\" To record the two days of parade and dulness that followed, would be too severe a task. At half past nine the breakfast-bell, and a morning sacrifice of pasties, hams, tongues, polled meats, with steaming urns and chocolate-pots, in a room hung with scarlet moreen, and facing the morning sun. Next, a stilling seance round a work-table, covered wilh worsted and carpet-work, till the servant's dinner-bell announces a hot luncheon in the scarlet room, now basking in meridian fervour. Then an airing in the family coach, or a walk in the formal Dutch garden, till the half-hour dressing-bell: a grand toilet of silks and satins, \u2014 dinner of four courses,\u2014 coffee, tea, whist,\u2014 and at half-past ten, a supper. Four regular meals a-day, eaten with the same dull people, in the same dull room, and unseasoned by a single word of rational conversation! In spite of my presentiments, the Mardynvilles were an acquisition to the party ; their exceeding absurdity proved a relief, after the common place jog-trot decorum of Sir John and his wife. Lady Mardynville insisted on making me Ihe accomplice of her affectation ; and talked of \" our friend, the Duke of Merioneth,\" and \" our balls at St. James's\""], [280, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 104 (to over-awe the country neighbours), in the style of Lady Blarney and Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs. But Ihis was not her worst offence. When we made our appearance in the drawing-room, jewelled to the teeth, to weary for the second day's dinner, Lady ___. who had departed after luncheon on a tour of visits, wilh her hostess, in the family coach, sailed up to me with a patronizing air, to assure me that dear old Lady Hartston was quite irate wilh Ihe Herberts, for not having apprized her of my presence at Hollybridge. \"My sister acted in compliance wilh my request,\" was my cold reply, \" I came to Bedfordshire expressly to visit her, and was anxious that the time we pass together should be as little as possible broken in upon by strangers.\" \" By strangers, \u2014 very possibly; but by friends, likeLady Hartston?\" \" With Lady Hartston I have not even the honour of acquaintance.\" \"Really? Why, she spoke of you with so much interest, and seemed to know you so intimately, lhat I concluded you had been friends for years. How strange 1\" ' ' Your mistake does me too much honour. I never spoke to her in my life.\" \" Well, you will speak to her soon. She is going [to Hollybridge on Saturday, expressly to wait upon you; although Lady Farrington informs me that Ihe old lady rarely pays morning visits.\" So, after all, I am condemned to become acquainted wilh Ihe surly old gentlewoman of the ventilator ; and to-morrow she will be here! How snug and comfortable every thing appears in our little greenery, after the glare and gormandizing of Farrington Park ! Of all the taxes whose payment falls to the lot of civilized mortals, what is callcd.our debt to society is certainly one of the heaviest. Saturday. \u2014 Decidedly, that Lady Mardynville is the fairy Guignon in disguise. As if for Ihe express purpose of annoyance, she persuaded Lady Farrington to drive her to Hollybridge to-day ; being well aware that Lady Hartston was lo be here. The grave old lady came, evidently disposed to be kind and courteous; but no sooner did the other two take Iheir places at the luncheon-table, than the Mardyn ville's abominable fine-ladyism disgusted her inlo silence. Throughout her flippancies and pretensions, she appealed to her dear Mrs. Delaval for confirmation ; and I had really no patience lo find myself elected the bosom-friend ofone, whom I have uniformly avoided as even a visiting acquaintance. What must Lady Hartston think of me, wilh two such associates as Miss Randall and thislion-and-unicorn hunter? She was very kind, however, in pressing me to visit her ; and it is ar ranged, that on Tuesday we dine and sleep at Ihe Abbey. Hartston. \u2014 I am half inclined to believe that the spirit of local sanc tity ig never wholly exorcised from the sileof a religious house! There is"], [281, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 105 a tone'of human tranquillity about this place, which inclines one to expect a procession of monks gliding through its woods, or an encounter with some cowled Benedictine, telling his beads among the ruins of the sanctuary. All is so calm, so still, so holy, that the very belling of the deer under the old oaks becomes a disturbance. Many people are of opinion that the Sir Jeffrey Hartston who, in Ihe reign of Elizabeth, erected the present mansion, chose ill in fixing Ihe site so close upon the ruins of the ancient abbey : but the monks seem to have understood the climate of England better lhan the generality of their successors ; and, in my opinion, the well-screened position of Hartston Abbey, seated on a gentle eminence sloping to a noble stream, is perfection. The park is skirted round by groves; and the freshness of the home-view delights me more than all the stares over a dozen counties, devised by modern villa-mongers, or puffed by modern auc tioneers. A library of old hooks, a gallery of old pictures, groves of old trees, and a service of old plate, assimilate well with the Eliza bethan solidity of the place. I do not wonder lhat the Mardynville called it dull : her parvenu love of glare and tinsel could not recognize the subdued beauties of a spot where Bacon might have mused, or Sidney meditated. There are two sine pictures here of the present Lord Hartston ; one, painted in early childhood, by Hoppner, in a style lhat might be mis taken for Reynolds ; the other, at the age of sixteen, by Lawrence. In this last, the youthful countenance gives indication of lhat striking expression of superiority\u2014 lhat stern, yet not harsh, Ihoughtfulness, so manifest now in the original. It is a fine and characteristic por trait. I went yesterday, alone, into the breakfast-room where it hangs, and carefully examined it. I was still standing with my eyes riveted upon the face, when the old lady, whom I had supposed to be driving out with the rest of the party, entered unobserved behind me. \"Thalis the likeness of the bestofsons,\" said she, startling me by the unexpected sound of her voice. \"You, who have only seen him care worn by the duties of office, and sallow wilh the unwholesome atmo sphere and habits of London, will scarcely recognize poor Eustace in that sine open ingenuous face.\" I felt too guilty to reply ; and Lady Hartston, apparently roused to family associations by these allusions to the portrait, look me to her private suite of rooms, and pointed out, with pride and delight, the Ihoughtfulness with which every modern invention, tending to the comfort of age, every piece of furniture suitable to her tastes and con venience, are constantly selected for her use by her son. \" Scarcely a week passes,\" said she, \" that Eustace does not send me down some trifle, to mark his unceasing recollection of his mother.\" Notwithstanding this increased intimacy between us, my awe of"], [282, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 106 Lady Harston does not, in the slightest degree, subside. Without the airdegrande dame ofthe Duchess of Merioneth, she is twice as im posing. Something in her costume or her countenance always brings Lady Rachel Russel to my mind ; she seems born to be the wife and mother of patriots. Herbert tells me she is the best-informed woman in England ; and Madame de Stael, who ought to bean authority, has assured us that \" lout savoirrend tres-indulgent .-\" yet indulgent she certainly is not. Elle a I 'esprit juste ; estimates people and things at their real value, and seems superior to that maudlin affectation of a virtue, which compromises every honest seeling under a pretence of philanthropy. I, therefore, knowing my weakness, shrink under the clear judgment of Lady Hartston. Walking with her in a beauliful flower-garden, laid out under the southern shelter ofthe walls ofthe old .'jbey, I ventured on the com monplace remark, lhat she must be greatly attached to so delightful a place. \" On the contrary,\" she replied, \" I prefer my own small dower house in Northamptonshire. Hartston is too vast for a person of my years, who is narrowing down her cares and wishes into a circle, cal culated to facilitate the transition into the last and narrowest home. I reside here only till the marriage of my son. Eustace's pursuits and habits prevent his giving his attention lo his property ; and I should be Sorry lo see the abode of his ancestors fall into decay. The time, I hope, is not far distant, when my presence will be superfluous ; and I shall gladly resign my trust lo younger hands.\" This, I suppose, is an intimation that Lord Hartston is about to be married ; and I find he is expected at the Abbey in ten days' time, for (he official recess. / shall then have left Bedfordshire. I have pro mised to join Lady Cecilia, who assures me she is seriously ill, at Cowes next week ; and if I can persuade her to accompany me, I will try a total change of scene by a short tour on the Continent, \u2014 Switzer land, the Rhine, \u2014 no matter where, so that I can hear new voices and see new faces for a time. \u2014 Yes! it is as I anticipated : Lord Hartston is going lo be married. After the carriages had been ordered this morning for our departure from the Abbey, Lady Farrington and Lady Mardynville were an nounced; and the severity of air which I find so overpowering in the old lady, grew more grim lhan ever, as she rose to receive them. Though seated al some distance, I overheard Lady Farrington ac counting sor the speedy renewal of her visit, by her desire to be among the first with her felicitations. Lady Hartston's \" I have not ihe salhfaction of comprehending you,\" was freezing. But the flow of Lady Farrington's wishy-washy conversation is not easily suspended ; and I soon caught the words,"], [283, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 107 ' ' satisfactory connexion,\" \u2014 ' ' charming young woman,\" \u2014 \"approach ing nuptials,\" \u2014 and domestic felicity.\" For some minutes, Ihe name of the intended bride escaped me : but, at length, the exuberant com mendation bestowed by the inveterate twaddler upon Ihe whole family of Rossana, guided my guesses ; and her assertion of Lady Sophia's superiority to her sister decided me, that Lord Penrhyn's cruel charmer was to be the suture Lady Hartston. Well, perhaps he could not have chosen better. There cannot be a more sober, regu lar, or better educated family. His mother said little on the subject; but we took our leave so immediately afterwards, that I had no op portunity to offer my congratulations. \u2014 Another letter from Cecilia, imploring me to join her immedi ately : I cannot refuse ; and the Herberts are so persuaded that I shall return to Hollybridge after a few weeks at Cowes, that they have readily sanctioned my immediate departure. I dare not say any thing at present of my continental project. There will be time enough to write, so soon as I shall have arranged my plans with Cecilia. I am satisfied that Herbert will not approve them; but when does he approve any decision of mine? \u2014 Happily, he will be too much en grossed by the approaching marriage of his friend, to trouble himself much concerning my proceedings. Cowes. \u2014 Weary of my journey, weary of myself, weary of every thing! Cecilia's indisposition is evidently the mere result of her anxie ties on account of her son ; and I have already been able to give a more satisfactory turn to the views of both. I cannot persuade her of the possibility of leaving England ; but Clarence is to accompany me to the Continent, as soon as she is well enough to part with us. We cannot travel alone ; and I have therefore consented lo engage a dame, or rather demoiselle de compagnie, a certain Miss Vinicomb, who officiat ed last season as souffre-douleur to Lady Evelyn Beresford, and was nearly worn into a consumption by arrow-root diet, and the whole some privations of an invalidery ; and whom Lady Cis recommends as an intelligent, accomplished woman. In ten days all will be prepared ; and \"fresh hopes and climates new\" will, I trust, restore that elasti city of spirits which the laborious lightness of London dissipation has so strangely subdued. England has served only to depress me ;\u2014 on the Continent, I look forward to being thoroughly \" desennuye'e.\" Calais. \u2014 Another kingdom\u2014 another climate\u2014 another language\u2014 another people\u2014 everything changed but my simple sorry self, and the change, already, how clearly demonstrated !

In England the same objects crumble down into a lumpish, dilapidated state. With us nothing seems to maintain its perpendicular but the character of the people. \u25a0 Is it not owing to this absence of the grand that we have forced our selves to become such devotees of the picturesque? My new friend, Miss Vinicombe, for instance, has the word perpetually in her mouth, and picturesquesies me out of all patience. During our trajet yester day from the Tower stairs to Calais harbour, she amused us by recit ing copious extracts from the diary of my sister journalist, the \" En nuye'e,-\" a book I used lo sigh over in my teens, but which, having survived (he age of sentimentality, I turn from as sickly and affected. Mrs. Trollope has been said to survey men and things as through the window of a hackney-coach ; the Ennuyee beholds (hem as through a picture-frame \u2014 nay, as through a claude-glass, or camera obscura; broad, open daylight is not admitted into her fanciful delineations. Her landscapes are taken from canvas rather than nature ; her human beings are those of poets and novelists \u2014 not the strong-handed, strong hearted slrugglers of daily life. But the world is not merely a place of palaces, where pictures are hung up and statues niched, or where Beatrices and Juliets step dain tily on pavements of marble. Sculpture and painting, poetry and ro mance, are things both beautiful and noble ; but nobler still are the every-day workings of the human mind \u2014 the progress of nations \u2014 the civilization of mankind. A morbid elegance of soul, or refine ment of (he imagination, produces less poetical results than many a stern reality. Rubens's picture of the Massacre of the Innocents made Ihe Ennuyee \" sick,\" and lo ! she cried aloud for an ounce of civet lo sweeten her imagination. A mere copy of it made me weep \u2014 ay, even lo suffocation ! My new companion, Miss Wilhelmina Vinicombe, is a votary of this super-sentimental school ; but Clarence Delaval will soon laugh down her flights into matter of fact. She savoured us wilh a touch of Sterne at Dessein's Hotel ; but we refused to hear the voice of the charmer, and affronted her into silence.

This town or city of Lille professes to be a chef-d'\u0153uvre of the art of fortification ; and Miss Vinicombe has been dragging poor Clarence along the banks ofa muddy canal, to peep after a citadel so ensconced by art and nature as to be visible only lo angels and skylarks. For my part, I am overcome by the glare and dust of yesterday's journey ; and Clarence has wisely suggested that, as the route from hence lo Brussels is uninteresting, we shall profit by the moonlight, and set forth at ten o'clock to-night. Freshness and dew will be welcome in deed, after the villanous smells of two French towns, and the blaze of a September sun. Hotel de Bellevue, Brussels. \u2014 I sadly fear the Vinicombe creature will prove a bore. Her extreme subservience made me fancy at first that I could dispose of her as I pleased ; but people sometimes ac quire importance from their insignificance, and my companion is so infinitely little, that I am afraid of administering to her Ihe lightest of those coups de pastes which I bestow unhesitatingly on Lady Ceci lia. Last night, after having bribed our way through the frontier custom-house at Pout-a-Tressin, I felt secure from further interrup tion; and burying myself in one corner of the britschka, while Cla rence mused in his, resigned myself to the rumination of sweet and bilter fancies; but the Vinicombe seemed determined lo make us the confidants of hers! \u2014 Our moonlight journey excited the vagaries of her imagination, and every namby-pamby stanza indited, from the beginning of time, to the refulgent lamp of night, was quoted for our edification, in a tone of tenderness which might have sickened the post-horses. Having elegized us into ill-humour, she began to skirmish through Marlborough's campaigns, \u2014 the scene of one of which we were tra versing, \u2014 in a style of blueism wholly insupportable. I longed to si lence her, but dreaded lo inflict humiliation on a person evidently la bouring in her vocation to afford me entertainment. At last she talked herself asleep ; and, by the time we quitted Alh, nothing but Miss Vinicombe's snoring afforded interruption to our meditations. This morning again she is so troublesomely officious, lhat my pa tience is almost at an end ; and she has come forth so armed for con quest, that I dread to appear in public. Sight-seers ought lo be scrupulously simple in their dress, to modify Ihe ridicule attached lo their attitude of gaping wonder.

It did not occur to me that this literary souffre douleur of mine\u2014 this living edition of the Ladies' Magazine\u2014 would prove so miserably de trop. I have seen other women get on admir ably wilh their demoiselles de compagnie ; perhaps Ihey had a better capacity for being toadied. What a stroke of good fortune, should I find at Spa some eligible dowager in want of a companion, lo whom this tiresome woman might be persuaded to attach herself ! But there seems the old ob jection,\u2014I am too young to travel alone with my still younger cou sin. Is there, then, after all, nothing but a husband in whom one cm find at once a safe and agreeable companion de voyage ? It is very singular lhat the English papers, usually so officious on such occasions, make not the slightest allusion to Lord Hartston's ap proaching marriage. I suppose he has taken care to keep Ihem si lent. I have received a short letter from Armine, and she, too, says not a word on the subject ; she has, in fact, no reason to suppose me interested in the matter. What a curious air of courtliness in this little capital ! In London, one may pass a year or Iwo without knowing it to be a royal residence. In Brussels, I defy you to spend an hour without noticing some shred or patch of regality \u2014 an aide-de-camp, with flaunting plume, dashing full speed along the park, or a court footman picking his way in silk stockings. You may even perceive a certain air of pragmatically in the way certain ladies sit stately in their gay open carriages, proclaim ing as plainly as deportment can speak, \" JVe have the entrees\u2014 vie are of the court.\" Even so the city itself tells of ils destinies. Thelowertown, wilh ils canals and severs, is truly the capital of Ihe Low Countries ; while the upper, or Austrianized Brussels, inoculated with Parisianism by Na poleon, is joyous, airy, architectural, worthy to be Ihe chef-lieu oi the newest of kingdoms.

During his absence, the influence of her parents will re sume its ascendancy with Lady ; and some fine day, Clarence will receive back his letters and lock of hair, and, about six months afterwards, learn from the newspapers, that Ihe only daughter of the Marquis and Marchioness of Clackmannan is about to be led to the hymeneal altar by Lord So and So.

It were as reason able to look for scent and colour in a flower reared in the darkness of a vault. Our Juliets, heaven bless them ! are not those of Verona. Clarence, who is just now almost as romantic as the Vinicombe, is anxious to skip our projected week at Spa, and fly at once to the Rhine, for a peep at \" beauty lying in the lap of horror.\" But at Spa I am to find letters from Hollybridge, of which I cannot disappoint myself. Meanwhile he has done mo good service by a private hint to Made moiselle V. to spare her rhapsodies to-morrow, as we Iraverse Ihe plain of Waterloo. Such subjects are sacred to me. The heroic death of my father has been so deeply and painfully the subject of my contemplations, that I cannot trust myself lo visit the details of a field of battle. Thoulouse and the forest of Soignies lie far apart ; but there are certain technical words and phrases inseparable from each, which have acquired a terrible importance in my ears. The events which at so early an age deprived me of both my parents, can never lose their importance. Of Waterloo, therefore, not a word I Liege. \u2014 Two charming days on the banks of the Meuse have ren dered me almost \" Ennuyee\"-ish ; and I have even consented to over look the sin of a sonnet perpetrated on the occasion by the Vinicombe. Well might Napoleon prize the possession of these beautiful pro vinces, his tenacity of which broke off the preliminaries of the peace of Chatillon, his last chance of salvation. I was reminded of my own Staffordshire and its silver Trent, of Colebrook Dale and the Severn ; but forced to render homage to the superior beauty of the Meuse, which the Vinicombe apostrophizes as Ihe younger and fairer, but less noble, sister of the Rhine. My prejudices are strong in savour of la cadetle. I admire her comely, thriving, prosperous face. The Meuse resem bles the throbbing artery of an active kingdom. All around it is in dustry and movement ; and hard indeed must have been the exactions of King William, to have excited against a roi industriel the abhorrence of his industry-loving Belgian subjects. As the originator of their most thriving speculations, the memory of the Dutch prince will, however, survive among their grandchildren when the new dynasty shall, after the fashion of ail dynasties, have taken ils turn of unpopularity. The Vinicombe insisted on visiting the old palace of the Prince Archbishop of Liege, for the purpose of inflicting \"Quentin Durward\" upon us, and Clarence has accordingly assigned her the sobriquet of \" The Bore of Ardennes.\" Why did I not accept the companion so strongly recommended for me to Armine, by Lady Hartston ?

I fancied Lady Hartston's protegee must be loo prosy and rational. And now, \u2014 I am \" sprighted with a fool\u2014 sprighled and angered worse ! \" Spa. \u2014 What a cool, tranquil little valley, to have been polluted into a fashionable watering place, a stage of folly for the antics of the beau monde of universal Europe. How strange, this evening, after our secluded drive and the rural sublimities of the Meuse, to fall suddenly upon a fashionable cavalcade of the Goslings and De Rawdons, their high-mettled steeds of Hyde Park and Epsom exchanged for ponies of the Ardennes ! \u2014 \" Oh ! fashion ill-inhabited ! worse than Jove in a thatched house.\" Notwithstanding their protestations of having found Spa delightful, I am convinced they have been bored to extinction, \u2014 the face of joy with which Lord Hampton and Sir Jervis Hall recog nized my carriage and welcomed Clarence Delaval, satisfied me that they were as glad of the sight of new faces as if they had been perform ing quarantine. Such is usually the case at watering places. People flatter themselves they have been mightily amused by including in their own experience all the legendary entertainments of preceding years ; and come away, saying to all the world, as was said by all the world before them, that Leamington, Wiesbaden, or Carlsbad is the most de lightful place on earth ; after having daily whispered to themselves during their sejour, that last season may have been pleasant enough, but lhat in the present one they have been unfortunate, \u2014 \" uncertain weather,\" \u2014 \"certain persons forcing themselves into society,\" etc., etc. Quant a moi, I am glad I am come so late, I am glad I am going so soon : for, though the environs promise many a pastoral stroll and ride, the Rhine season is too far advanced to admit of loitering. The Gosling set, it seems, have established an exclusive English table-d'hote at Spa, of which the device appears to be 11 Nui tfaura du salmis, Hors ?ious et nos amiss and the general company, including Russians, Germans, French, and Belgians, of the highest rank, feel themselves exceedingly ill-used. The Goslingites pretend, on one hand, lhat people are free lo form what conventions they please in the hotel they occupy; the foreigners contend, on the other, that, by a proceeding so arrogant and so con trary to the spirit which dictates the customs of all foreign bathing places, they have declared war against the community. All thisi s very English ;\u2014 I shall be glad when we have seen the last of May Fair and its fooleries. How provoking 1\u2014 Lord Hampton and the De Rawdons set off for the Rhine on the same day with ourselves ; and, without a positive act of ungraciousness, I cannot negative their proposal lhat we should"], [289, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 113 form a single parly. Now, of all injudicious arrangements, one which tends lo quarter a caravan of fastidious English people in an inferior con tinental inn, is the most absurd. We must not even venture to pause, unless where Ihe accommodations are first-rate ; so adieu my hopes of smiling villages and rustic hamlets. When shall I ever become really mistress of my actions ! The Vinicombe, meanwhile, is enchanted! Two men of fashion and a languishing ladyship fully counterbalance the probable evil of an insufficiency of beds and post-horses. I fancy she would offer to sleep with Lady Maria's poodle, rather than lose the accession to our party. Clarence wishes lo remain here a few days longer with the Goslings, and is to rejoin me at Ems. I am persuaded his only object is to get rid of Ihe De Rawdons. LB3n.11. \u2014 Where is the beautiful Rhine\u2014 the picturesque Rhine \u2014 tho river of lays and legends \u2014 odes, novels, and romances ? As far as we have proceeded, the New River, or the Eanbrink Canal, would form quite as fair a mark for poelry ; and, except the companions of my journey, never did I meet with any thing less interesting than its ob jects ! I admit, however, that I am fairly ill with fretting. The let ters I received at Spa afforded a climax to my vexations. Herbert and his wife take no pains to conceal their dissatisfaction at my sudden ex pedition; and, like the voices which attacked Princess Parizarde on her mountain, call upon me loudly to return. They pretend that the palladium of my happiness exists in England, and lhat I am running after new misfortunes. Uuluckily I do not and cannot defy augury?; and Armine's adjurations have strongly affected my mind. Here, on. the wide continent, I feel the want of a friend. Clarence is too young to obtain my confidence, the Vinicombe a mere girouette ; and as to that worldliest of worldly women whom my little cousin calls \"la fimme au masque defer,\" Lady Maria de Rawdon, I should as soon dream of pouring my secrets into the Lion's Moulh of Venice as into her car. By the- way, it strikes me as singular that tho Herberts so pointedly avoid all allusion to Hartston Abbey and its inhabitants? They give me a long uninteresting message from stupid Lady Tarring ton, but not a word of the Harlstons. How dispiriting is this chilly autumn weather ; and how much more am I inclined for a quiet fire-side, than for sight-seeking wilh a set of listless, supercilious companions !

But I might have spared my fears. Miss Vinicombe readily accepted Lady Maria's invilation lo Burscheid; and I should have perhaps enjoyed Ihe salisfaction of performing my pilgrimage; alone, had not Lord Hamplon expressed himself curious lo have a look into Ihe \" rum old church.\" \"And pray who the devil was ' Carolo Magno ?

Oh! ah! yes! \u2014 I recollect, \u2014 Robertson's Charles V.\" The patriarch of chivalry seemed to hold no place in Lord Hamp ton's memory, or he might, perhaps, (who knows ?) have apostro phized him as Lucien Buonaparte's Charlemagne . At the Holel-dc- Ville, erected on Ihe foundations ofthe palace in which the Emperor of Romance beheld the light, we were shown a picture commemorat ing the first Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, and containing portraits of the diplomatists assembled to parcel out Europe into new kingdoms. \" Voild,\" said the valet-de-place, \" le portrait du representqnt d'Anglelerre.\" \" Et qui, done? \" \" Le Chevalier Robinson.\" \"Crusoe, \u2014 no doubt,\" was Lord Hampton's facelious rejoinder. \" Et qui, diable, nous a represente au second ?\" ' ' Mouseigneur le Due de Vilainton , Electeur d'Anglelerre,\" replied the man, not facetiously, but in sober earnest. And he drew us away from the congress-chamber, to exhibit a monument, now alas 1 his torical, \u2014 Ihe studio in which Sir Thomas Lawrence painted his sine portraits for the gallery of our Prince Regent. \"So you have been rubbish-hunting in the old church; what on earth did you sind there lo amuse you?\" inquired Captain de Rawdon, when at the close of the day we met over a most Germanic dinner of chevreuil, wilh stewed apricots, pancakes, and carpes du Rhin. \" All sorts of things,\" was Lord Hampton's comprehensive reply. \" In Ihe first place, a pair of bronze doors, through the lions' noses of which, Satan, in proper person, is said lo have thrust his singers\u2014 the"], [291, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 115 doors, being much finer, by the way, than ihe grille which our friend Stanhope bought sorElvaston.

I only know that it is eight feet long; and lhat in former times, two hundred thousand pilgrims a day used to come and do it homage.\" \" I wonder if we could possibly procure an order? It would be capital fun to see the reliques,\" said Captain De Rawdon. \" Could we not make the attempt, my dear Lady Maria?\" added the Vinicombe, in a deprecating voice. \" We shall see the same sort of thing at Cologne, and we have all the churches and reliques of Italy before us 1\" replied her impassive ladyship. \"What can be the use of loitering at Aix-la-Chapelle? Do, pray, let us get on.\" On, therefore, we proceeded to Cologne the following morning ; Cologne, which, in spite of its dozen churches and one unique cathe dral, struck me as the most abject of God's cities. All we read of ils swarming monks and beggars of Ihe olden lime, all we see of its narrow filthy streets of to-day, sufficiently accounts for Ihe whereabout of Jean Maria Farina's invention \u2014 stupidly attributed by naturalists to the vicinage of the seven mountains, and those varieties of aromatic herbage, some leagues further on the opposite bank of the Rhine. In such cases as the creation of eau de Cologne, the nose is better autho rity lhan cilher ears or eyes. I proposed setting forward in a single parly, for the labour of sight seeing : being anxious to economize tho Vinicombe, lest peradventuro Lady Maria should discover her capacities as a bore, before the great object is achieved of having her seduced away from me, to accompany her new palroness inlo Italy. After having attended, en masse, a mass at the military church of St. Geryon, admired the eleven thou sand skulls of St. Ursula's virgins, and the three of the magi or kings of Cologne, the gorgeous chest of the reliques and the chef-d'oeuvre of Rubens (the Crucifixion of St. Peter, which made Lord Hampton fancy he was standing on his head), we had unluckily lillle lima left us to devote to the interior of that unrivalled monument of the Gothic architecture, the Dam Kivclt. We were told lhat the King of Prussia is taking steps towards ils completion. He can do nothing better to wards the establishment of his popularity in his Rhenish dominions ; which, having endured Ihe sale of most frontier countries, a complexity 8*"], [292, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 116 of masters, are at present sadly to seek in the virtue of loyalty.

The Vinicombe, who made his acquaintance at some Skinnerial liger-feed, when the Baron was lionizing in London, luckily cast her shadow before in a billet-doux from Aix-la-Chapelle, announcing her visit lo the vicinity of Bonn ; and the Baron, so far sage and discriminating, pleads a migraine in apology for absence without leave.

The house was amply stocked with provisions, and the sloves were already lighted in a fine old suite of rooms formerly occupied by the Superior of the convent, and latterly by a noble family ofCoblenlz; and I am convinced the whole scheme was pre-organized by the trai tor Birtsch, who probably despatched a foot-passenger across the mountains lo forewarn his kinsman, as soon as he had succeeded in starling us from Andernach at so unseemly an hour. We were, on the whole, belter accommodated than at any inn since we left Brussels. Before dinner was over, our luggage (includ ing Ma'mselle Angelique) made its appearance.

I was so overcome, indeed, by the severity of my illness, that I could not interest myself as at any oilier period in the tidings from England, which awaited Clarence on his return here from Stulgardt; not, indeed, that the poor fellow saw any cause for rejoicing in the news that his father had got him appointed attache at Vienna, instead of al lowing him to pass the winter at Paris. But he obeyed wilh a tole rable grace, and I have already received letters announcing his safe arrival, his presentation to the Emperor, and a determinalion lo beas merry and wise under his tribulations as circumstances will allow.

I expect to find there despalches from England, con taining tellers of introduction from Ihe Delavals and Lady Soulham, which will be Ihe means of procuring me agreeable sociely for Ihe winter. Once more, then, I am on the threshold of a strange city! To a poor weak woman, the approach to Paris is more exciting lhan even"], [305, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 129 the approach to London ; for London is the city of business, \u2014 Paris of pleasure ; London the emporium of sense, \u2014 Paris of nonsense; London a wood of thriving timber, \u2014 Paris a garden of ever-varying flowers. London is the mighty throne whence the world is legislated, \u2014 Paris the graceful temple whence it is civilized. London is Ihe stern and helmeted Pallas, \u2014 Paris the many-hued Iris. London is, in short, the capital for men, and Paris for women ! There we live, and move, and have a being worthy to be so called. There we still excercise an influence in society. There we are not only allowed to talk, but still strangers are earnestly called upon to listen. There, if I am to believe a thousand travelled men and women, we exercise the prerogative which, during the last century, rendered the reign of Louis XV. a reign of cotillons, and conducted the hus band of Marie Antoinette lo the scaffold. Paris is, par excellence, moreover, the fountain-head of fashion. When a well-dressed woman enters a London ball-room, it is in stantly asserted that she receives from Paris all the appliances and means which render her irresistible ; \u2014 her coiffeur arrives from Paris every spring, and her shoes are forwarded by Melnotte in the despatch bag. Have you a pretty piece of trinketry on your table, or a hand some vase on your chimney-piece, every admiring visiter is sure to observe, \"It is evidently Parisian.\" No one presumes to wear an artificial flower manufactured elsewhere than in the Rue de Richelieu, or to appear in a hat which has not le cachet d'Herbault. And now I am at length arrived at this El Dorado of frivolity and fancy. The modes I used to receive with such glee in London, I shall now snatch fresh from the mint ; and whereas universal Europe derives her cooks, milliners, and dancing-masters from this land of taste, I shall probably, for the sirst time, hail the perfection of la cui sine et les graces. (In grateful remembrance of George Hanton, I yield precedence to the casserole. ) For some time to come, however, I will eat, drink, dress, and be merry, without committing to paper the commentations of my wonder ing ignorance. Let me be fairly oriente'e, before I presume to tell myself what / think of la grande nation, which thinks so much of itself. Coleridge observes, that Frenchmen are like grains of gun powder, dirty and despicable singly, but tremendous in the mass ; now, as I happen highly to estimate a few separate grains, such as little Vauguyon and Monsieur de Nivelles, I may perhaps also reverse the philosopher's opinion, and despise the million.

In Paris, for instance, more lhan in any place I ever vi sited, people see with Ihe eyes of their clique; and political events have tended to create so many, and of such antipodal qualities, lhat little reliance is lo be placed on such blind guides. Par exemple.'\u2014Aiier despatching various leltersXf introduction, which I had received from England, the two first visits I received were from the young Countesse de Merinville, daughter to one of Napoleon's parvenu generals, wife lo a member ofthe present royal household; and the Marquise de Rrelonvilliers, an ultra of the Faubourg St. Germain, descended from one of those beatific holy Roman-Empire families, whose letters of nobility are dated from the ark. First came my pretty Countess, all grace and gaiety, instructing me in Ihe measures to be laken to secure a private presentation at the Tuileries; which, thanks lo my poor father's former, intimacy with Louis Philippe, will, I find, be easily accomplished. \" You would otherwise,\" said Madame de Merinville, \" have been obliged to wait for the cohue of the first of January: when all your countrywomen who can command a salin gown thrust themselves inlo the palace, so as to render the ceremony of presenlalion most tedious to their majesties \u2014 most unsatisfactory to the belter kind of English \u2014 aud all for the satisfaction of figuring afterwaids at our mob-balls of four thousand nobodies, given as a sugar-plum to the National Guard, and to promote the interests of trade.

Du reste, it provokes them beyond measure, that not a disparaging word can be said of our court of to-day. The domestic virtues of the King and Queen, the elegance and propriety of the Princesses, Ihe distinguished air of the young Princes, the high character of the va rious members of the household, are obstacles they cannot get over. Since the reign of Napoleon (the most magnificent since Ihe days of Louis XIV ) never was the court of France so brilliant as now. So many distinguished foreigners of all nations pass the winter in Paris : the troubles of Spain and Portugal \u2014 the cholera in Italy \u2014 the tyranny of St. Petersburg \u2014 the fogs ofthe Thames \u2014 secure us all lhat is illus trious and wealthy in Europe.

She began with polite in quiries after my health, my journey, and Ihe health and happiness of Lady Southam, from whom I had received my introduction to her acquaintance, and ended with a polite offer to present me to the whole of hers. Nothing could exceed her regret that I should have lodged myself in so detestable a quarter as the Rue de Rivoli. I ventured a few apologetic words in savour of its cheerfulness, its atmosphere, its central position. \" I find myself,\" said I, \"in the neighbourhood of all my friends.\" \" Yes; I believe the English lodge principally in this noisy trading quarter,\" she replied. \"The sound of the omnibuses from morning till ni\"ht would distract us who are accustomed to hotels, entre cour etjardin.

Yes ! at all periods of political history there will be found renegades and apostates. But, of the very few of the ancien regime, who have degraded themselves by joining the new order of things, a few are decrepit peers of France in their dotage, who think it their duty to make their bow to the throne, let who will be seated there ; others are indigent parents of large families who have sons to provide for, \u2014 and a few, \u2014 giddy young people, who flock to the sound of a violon or a cor-de-chasse , \u2014 boys who cannot give up the hunting parties of the Duke of Orleans, or frivolous wo men who have been cajoled by his attentions. \" The address of the two elder Princes was much admired in Eng land, \"said I. \"I remember one night at a party at our minister, Lord G 's, seeing the Duke of Orleans back out of the room, after taking leave of one of our royal Princes, with a grace that would have done honour to Louis XIV.\" \" The young man has not quite lost the good air he acquired in the salons of Charles X.,\" observed the prejudiced Marchioness. \"But we think better of the Duke of Nemours ; he is said to be a legitimist at heart. The princesses, I believe, are worthy young women, unpeu bourgeoises , but perpectly well-conducted.\" Having engaged me to attend her weekly receptions, the Marchio ness curtsied with the most formidable politeness, and ceremoniously withdrew. The disgust with which I doubtless inspired her must have been sadly increased by meeting in my antechamber Madame Lemailre, wife of one of the first bankers in Paris, on whose house I have letters of credit. Madame Lemaitre is neither so young as my pretty little courtieress, nor so old as my ultra, but just at the age when a Frenchwoman, mis doubting her attractions, begins to rely upon the merits of her toilet, and acquires a certain restless gaiety of assumed youthfulness. I found her very voluble, full of pet phrases, and a code of fashionability founded on the influence of her gorgeous hotel in the Chaussee d'Antin, her boxes at all the theatres, her diamonds and pearls, her carriages and horses, and maitres d'hotel, and chasseurs, and villa at Bellevue. She had]the air ofa London sine lady manquee, for her splendour did not sit easily.

I shall go lo all, for I wani to acquaint myself with this new world, and am not afraid, like poor Madame de Bretonvilliers, of committing myself. And now, having written so much of people, a word or two of things. In this city, where so much is vast and splendid, so much mean and barbarous, I am constantly startled by incongruities. One finds, to be sure, the \" pierre precieuse,\" but, like the diamond in Ihe fable, it is found \" en graitant lefumier.\" There is great elegance and great coarseness, much magnificence and much shabbiness. The palaces, the public buildings, many of the private hotels, are noble and nobly situated; but, wilh few exceptions, the streets are so narrow, dirty, and disgusting, that the lanes of our own city would gain by comparison. The ill-kept, ill-lighted, ill-ventilated staircases, in common to a dozen families, render it disagreeable lo pay visits or to go shopping, for most of the superior magazins are established with out show on a first, second, third, or even fourth story ; indeed, in many commercial streets, the best apartments are on the second floor, on account of the deficiency of light and air beneath. The houses in the Place Vendome are among the finest in Paris, but grand and incom modious ; those of the rue de Provence quarter the most convenient; those of the Faubourg St. Honore and Ville l'Eveque, wilh their charming gardens, the most agreeable ; and those of the fine dull old slreets of the Faubourg St. Germain the most spacious, aristocratic, gloomy, and, it is said, unwholesome. At the present season, there is little morning movement in the slreets ; few carriages but those of foreigners and official people are stirring. After dinner commence the visits, the spectacles, the parties, when all is vivacity and noise. The higher orders have not the habit of what Ihey call \" courir,\" like the shop-hunting English. They have not much money to throw away ; and, wilh the exception of the banking, stock-broking set, which re presents ihe fermiers gencraux of former days, do not seem fond of baubles. It is only just now, when they are purchasing their e'trennes for the first of January, lhat they display the passion for knick-knacks we are apt to attribute to the French. But as, according to the adage, \" The children of Holland take pleasure in making, What the children of England take pleasure in breaking ;\" I believe their bijouterie and nouveautes are chiefly manufactured for the foreign markets.

By Ihe way, I must observe, lhat the banker's wife alone talked \" toilette\" to me. Madame Lemaitre was urgent in recommending me to place myself in the hands of such and such tradespeople, and seemed to think my salvation or my genlilily must depend on being dressed by Palmyre, Herbault, Fossin, Edouard, Nattier, and Melnotte. Madame de Merinville said nolhing on Ihe subject ; from the force of custom, she fancied il impossible that any others could be employed ; while Madame de Brelonvilliers was si lenl, from seeling self assured that no femme comme il faut can pos sibly appear ill-dressed. \u2014 Just returned from my presentation ; a far less formal affair than I expected. I am charmed wilh the King and Queen \u2014 the Queen most, though the former spoke to me of my father with tears in his eyes.

Sunday. \u2014 To-day, my dinner at my banker's \u2014 a far more solemn festival lhan my debut at the Tuileries! At six, and precisely, \u2014 for I find Ihe French exact to a minute in keeping engagements, \u2014 I was ushered through a throng of ill-looking servants in new, ill-made livery, through a sine suite of rooms to a salon hung wilh white and gold, with massive gold fringes. Monsieur Lemaitre, who met me at the door, led me, bowing at every step, to his lady, occupying a fauteuil in Ihe place of honour. Several guests were already collect ed ; among those who immediately followed, I distinguished the names of three of the ministers and their wives ; and in a sow minutes folding-doors were thrown open, and a solemn looking maitre d'hotel whispered \u2014 \" Madame est servie.\" There was nothing of the horri ble before-dinner pause \u2014 that chasm to be silled up wilh small talk \u2014 so invariably produced in London by the want of punctuality of impo lite \"uesls, or an unaccomplished cook ; and our places at (able being pointed out by a written card in each plate, no confusion arose in tak in\" our seals. I was placed between the master of the house and one of\u00b0the most eminent of the ministers\u2014 a little under-bred, common looking man, far belter calculated lo shine in the chambre than the salon. The conversation he addressed to me was so diluted to what he supposed the level of my understanding, lhat I would rather he had talked exclusively to his opposite neighbour, one ofthe greatest capi talists in France, to whom his discourse was of railroads\u2014 railroads\u2014"], [312, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 136 railroads\u2014; and the gigantesque of his views on this gigantic topic highly entertained me. The dinner was splendid, much like those of Merioneth House, with the exception that there was no fine buffet of family plate, and that the dessus-de-table or plateau, which occupies the whole length ofa French dinner-table, was merely oior-molu and crystal. The service was long, formal, and tiresome, every dish, even to the most trifling hors d'\u0153uvre, being carefully served round in suc cession to the eighteen guests before the ceremony was concluded. Champagne was not introduced till dessert ; yet its aid was not want ing, as in England, to enliven the party. Everybody talked incessantly; nor did I once hear that ominous clatter of knives and forks, which has often betrayed to me the dulness of my own dinner table. Dur ing dinner, a single glass of sherry, and weak Bordeaux and water, seemed the beverages in favour; at dessert, Champagne and Tokay. The French of the present day are singularly temperate ; and a lady seen to drink a glass of pure wine, or a second glass of champagne, would be unkindly thought of. At the conclusion of dessert we were handed by the gentlemen to the drawing-room, coffee having been already served ; and in a few minutes the carriages of the ministers were announced, and the solemn affair was over. In my ignorance, I had not ordered my carriage till ten o'clock ; but Madame Lemaitre, perceiving my embarrassment, good-naturedly proposed that I should accompany her to her sister, Madame Fournier's, the wife of a rich receveur-ge'ne'ral, who has music every Sunday evening, There I sound the Grisi, the venerable Grassini, Tamburini, Rubini, and above all the great maestro, Rossini, himself, the idol of all these financial people. The witliness for which he was long celebrated is said, indeed, to be in some degree obscured by the excellence of their dinners and suppers ; they have crammed him into dulness. Madame Fournier's music was exquisite ; her society, I suspect, so-so. The women were over-dressed and affected ; the men \" des fashionables ,\" a bad imitalion of English dandies, and decidedly the least admirable class of la jeune France. The ineffability of an Englishman of fash ion, with his five, ten, fifteen, twenty thousand a year, \u2014 his valets, and villas, and travelling carriages, and hunting boxes, \u2014 is compara tively a consistent folly. From Eton to Almack's he is pampered into the languid, supercilious inanily which dozes through a London season, after the labours of its moors, its Melton, and its steeple chases. Not so, these pseu&o-\" fashionables\" of the Cafe Tortoni ; with their two or three hundred per annum, pour tout potage, their lives must consist of an alternation of luxe et indigence.

Their finery is a hol low affair. , January 1st. \u2014 This is no weather for sight-seeing ; I have therefore deferred my visits to the wonders of the metropolis till a milder season ; and, being at Rome, am doing as Romans do. Le jour de Van! \u2014 three inches of snow and forty thousand people, \u2014 nay, I should think, twice as many, \u2014 in the streets. To-day everybody calls upon every body ; millions of visiting cards are dispersed by people who make it their business to undertake the circulation ; and, for once in its life, all the world is generous. During the last week, the toy-shops of Gi roux, la Porte Chinoise, and the Palais Royal, have presented a per petual stream of customers; and it would be a curious task to compute the amount of money expended from Christmas to new-year's day, in the purchase of sugar-plums \"and gewgaws equally useless. N'im porte-' \u2014 the whole city is in movement ; no business \u2014 no care. Every face wears a smile, for the French possess beyond all people the art of disencumbering themselves at will of the troubles of life ; they put aside their vexations for a day, as they would a hat or a cloak; while we English, labour as we will, find it impossible to pluck out every thorn from our sides on even the most exciting occasion : hence our care worn aspect. Life sits heavily upon us ; we are a grave, considering people, deeply impressed with our moral responsibilities. 2nd. \u2014 Last night the ministers, corps diplomatique, and public bodies, were received at court pour souhaiter la bonne annee d leurs Majestes. To-night it has been our turn, and I had the satisfaction of seeing the stale-rooms in full splendour. I can imagine nothing more regally royal. The grand staircase and salle des mare'chaux dazzlingly white, and radiantly illuminated, are worth a whole parish of Pimlico palaces ! The receptions here are very differently managed from our drawing rooms. The ladies attending are placed, as they happen to arrive, along the whole range of state apartments ; the royal family, entering from the petits appartemens, address themselves in succession to each, pursuing the long line till they return again, hoarse and fatigued, to the point from whence they started. First appears the King, attended by his e'tat major, preceded by the aide-de-camp in waiting, who names every lady to his Majesty. To each, the King addresses, wilh obsequious courtesy, some common-place remark, and passes on. Next comes the Queen, for whom the same ceremonial is observed by her lady of honour : after her, Madame Adelaide ; then the two charming Princesses ; lastly, the Dukes of Orleans and Nemours. You hear nothing but the iteration of the same barren phrases : \u2014 \" I hope you are not inconvenienced by the heat.\" \u2014 \"Have you been long in"], [314, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 138 Paris?\" \u2014 \"Do you make a prolonged stay in France?\" Towards my self, and those with whom the royal family are personally acquainted, a greater degree of familiarity is exhibited ; but Ihere is something of kindliness, oilienveillance, oilonte, in the demeanour of the Queen, imparting value to her most trifling compliments. I accompanied Madame de Merinville to the reception, who pointed out with pride Ihe representatives of many of the first houses in France; would I could have shown her, in return, a more desirable display of my country-people! In addition to the fifty or sixty who did us honour, there were several hundreds who could ground no pre tension to appear there upon previous presentation at our own court, and among them several decidedly and notoriously inadmissible. This arises from want of due importance being invested in the English am bassadress. No English gentleman can be presented to the King, except by his ambassador ; no English lady ought lo obtain access to Ihe Queen, unless under the sanction of her ambassadress. At present applications are made direct to the dame d'honnenr, and immediately granted. Invitations follow, and England becomes most unworthily represented at the court of the Tuileries. To procure access lo Ihe British Embassy, on the contrary, it is indis pensable, to produce a sufficient letter of recommendation. Mine, which was from Lady Soulham, secured me a kind reception, an immediate invitation lo dinner, and a general one to the Friday evening parlies. French families, who have the entree, maintain their privilege of coming uninvited whenever the ambassadress receives company ; but very few Carlists visit the embassy; not from deficiency of regard or respect towards its occupants ; but because they are apprehensive of meeting certain ministerial and political notabilite's, with whom they do not choose to come in contact. Next in importance is the salon of the Austrian Ambassadress, the personal friend of our own, and one of the most amiable and graceful women of the day. Zrd. \u2014 To-night I made my debut in the circle of Madame de Bre tonvilliers ; and am still shivering at the recollection ! The great gloomy court-yard in the Rue de Grenade, the dark damp stair-case, the stifling garlic-scented ante-chamber, Ihe ill-lighted rooms, the formal assemblage, were not compensated by the vastness of Ihe anti quated saloons, and lhat magniloquent nomenclature of the guests. No young people, the ladies scarcely even in demi-toilette, muffled in bonnets and shawls \u2014 and coldness and formality enough to have frozen a salamander. I was presented to several duchesses whose titles are historical, and who, by their appearance, may have figured in the Fronde. But I suspect there was a vapour of the Tuileries clinging to my garments, for they eyed me most contemptuously. We"], [315, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 139 had two Boston tables and a \"wish;\" eau sucre'e and weak syrup and water were handed round by way of refreshment ; the candles seemed lo burn dim ; the lofty saloon was as hazy as one of our great theatres in the month of November ; a sensation of ague seemed creeping over me. Dinner invitations, from the Bretonvilliers, are as much out of the question as to the (able of his holiness. The people of his caste are supposed to dine, but the fact has never been proved to foreigners by ocular demonstration. We are apt to fancy in England that every great French family has its Ude; whereas none but the ambassadors, ministers, or great bank ers, affect to give dinners, or even keep a chef. There was only Roths child, in all Paris, who could venture upon Careme ! Just returned from a brilliant ball chez le ministre de . These ministerial fetes are considered far from select, but my eye is not yet sufficiently familiar wilh the surface of French society to delect the fault. The house, an official residence, was noble, and nobly lighted ; the orchestra admirable ; and the whole thing faultlessly arranged. A French ball-room presents a more orderly aspect than ours. The ladies are seated side by side round the room, generally in a double row ; and no gentleman would dream of usurping a place among them ; Ihe seats are occupied by the same persons throughout the evening ; when they dance, a handkerchief or bouquet is left lo engage the place. The room has, consequently, the appearance of being lined with beautiful women, who are led out to dance, then re-conducted to Iheir seais. There is no wandering up and down, no pushing to get in here or out there, as in an English party, whereon the demon of restlessness appears to have set his seal. Our ladies fair are, in fact, too fond of lounging about on Ihe arms of men, to whom they are comparatively strangers, to stare at this beauty, laugh at that quiz, or ascertain, by the most insolent coolness of investigation, whether they like the looks of Lady A. or Lady B., sufficiently to be introduced to her. They seem to fancy themselves privileged in rudeness towards any one not exactly belonging to Iheir own set, \u2014 to sneer \u2014 to elbow to push aside. French women, on the contrary, are peculiarly courteous to strangers. If thrust against their intentions into a crowd, there is a coaxing tone in Iheir merest \"Pardon, madame,millepar dons !\" which if not sterling gold, is very pretty tinsel. The men in society here take my fancy less than the women. The very young ones affect Anglomania, and talk of nothing but horses and la chasse, in a tone of affectation ridiculous to English ears. Still worse are the jeunes elegans, the Iook-and-die class, who dress a la moyendge, and, like other miles, are vast underminers \u2014 of female re putation. I omit a few charming old men of the old school, all ur banity and good-breeding ; but after a time their flowery nothingness"], [316, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 140 becomes tedious : and, on the whole, the most agreeable companions are the men of about fifty, whose youth was passed at the imperial court, where ability was the passe partout ; ' ' men of the world, who know the world like men.\" From one thing, at least, you are secure in French society\u2014 the proud, reserved, unsocial, \" superior man,\" so often met with in England\u2014 a miser of his own mind, who stalks through life as if he owed no kindly reciprocation of his sociability to his fellow-creatures. The French seem to have their temper or their temperament more under their own controul than the English. Just returned from a ball at the Tuileries! \u2014 what a singular scene !\u2014 truly and indeed the fete of a roi citoyen \u2014 one of the few moral traces yet remaining of the July Revolution ; a ball of four thousand persons, two thousand of whom are chosen from the middle or somewhat below the middle, classes. Such an assemblage neces sarily excites the disgust of the escutcheoned magnates of the feudal party ; for the worsted epaulets of the National Guard are to their disdainful eyes as the sign of the Beast. But for myself, who have no nalional pride to be wounded by the contact, I confess that an enter tainment given by the king, not to his court, but to his subjects, af fords unmixed satisfaction. Prejudice apart, I distinguished nothing in the dress or deportment of the guests, differing from those of society in general. I never saw assembled a greater number of elegant or elegantly attired women ; and as to the inconvenience complained of, the pressure of the crowd \u2014 (no greater, by the way, than at some charity<ball at Almack's \u2014 Caledonian or Hibernian) \u2014 it was easily to be avoided by arriving early, and taking a seat for the evening in the salle de marechauix, where their majesties and the court remain stationed till the announcement of supper. It is the custom [of the fine to show themselves for an hour, and retire about eleven ; but I declined accompanying Lady Sarah Andover's party home, and re mained with Madame de Merinville to witness the supper spectacle, often described to me as unique in brilliancy. The banquet is served in the salle de spectacle, on tables occupy ing the ground floor and the circle of the balcon \u2014 a military band and a host of spectators occupying the second tier of boxes. The theatre is resplendently illuminated with innumerable chan deliers, and the supper served exclusively upon plate. But the pecu liar brilliancy of Ihe scene is attributable to the circumstance that not a single gentleman is allowed to enter till the ladies have risen from supper ; and the tables are consequently ornamented by uninterrupted lines of gay and beautiful women, glittering with diamonds and adorned wilh the richest costumes. And this vast area of the salle appears to be waving with plumes, and variegated by flowers. A place was reserved for me beside that of Madame de Merinville,"], [317, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 141 at the central table, occupied by the royal family and the household. As the queen took her seat, the band struck up the inevitable quatuor d'usage from Lucile, \u2014 \" Oil peut-on e'tre mieux qu'au sein de sa famille?\" and after a supper, including hot soups, entrees, etc,, served by four hundred domestics, half of whom are in full court dress, the other half in the royal livery, the queen rose and returned to the ball-room, followed by Ihe whole assemblage. Our re-en trance, by the way, was somewhat formidable, through an apparently interminable lane, extending from gallery to gallery, of brilliant uni forms and scrutinising faces, waiting to rush into the supper-room. Dancing was immediately resumed, but I retired with my little friend ; my eyes absolutely dazzled by the bright illumination of the Tuileries, and the glittering variety of uniforms, French, English, Russian, Austrian, Hungarian, Greek, Highland, Oriental, contributory to the splendours of a ball chez le Roi Citoyen. Let the exclusives say what they will, a fete attended by sour thousand prosperous, happy looking people, under the roof of a noble palace, cannot but leave a most agreeable impression on the mind. Thursday. \u2014 Loitered away an evening at the weekly soiree of an English exclusive of the secondary class, long resident here. About twenty women, about thirty men, of divers nations, apparently habitue's oi Ihe house, dropping in one after the other, to feast upon weak lea and equally vapid causerie. None but the French can converse a whole evening without effort ; the English (du grand monde) keep Iheir attention alive only when whipped up by little serpent-scourges of ill-nature. The soiree of last night was the only one where I have heard a whisper of scandal ; my countrywomen certainly possess a marvellous instinct for tearing each other to pieces. \" When an Italian is questioned concerning another Italian in a foreign country,\" said the Neapolitan Secretary of Legation to me, the other night, \" he feels it a duty to make the best of his countryman. Unless he should labour under a serious stigma, we manage to say something courteous in his behalf. But question one English lady concerning another, and you would suppose the whole nation to con sist of lost women or vulgar roturieres. It is either \u2014 ' I know nothing of her ; she was never heard of in society in England ! ' or \u2014 ' Pray do not talk to me of such a person ; nothing can be more notorious than her conduct.' More diverting was the naivete of the beautiful Marchesa who exclaimed (on occasion of a tremendous storm excited some years ago in the English Society of Rome, by the appearance of Lady * * * at the assemblies of the Hanoverian ambassador), ' Their virtue 1 their virtue ! How indelicate of these Englishwomen to be"], [318, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 142 always talking aboul their virtue ! We never heard such a thing al luded to, till the English came among us after the peace ! ' To-night at Lady Harriet's, the King's ball was a target for the dis charge of general impertinence. \" Were you at that thing at the Tuileries, last night?\" inquired a Carlist Duchess of my friend Lady Sarah Andover. \" For an hour or two. I dined there on Sunday ; so I thought it a good occasion to go and make my visite de digestion. By the bye, I did not see you in ihemelee?\" she continued, turning to our hostess. \" I do not happen to have a gown just now, old and shabby enough to venture into a mob !\" replied her ladyship. \" I shall go lo Ihe private ball next week. Was there any thing amusing last night?\" \" Less amusing than usual. On account of this political de'mele, we had no Americans. I do so dote upon the Yankees at those balls, whisking through the waltz wilh Iheir Bourguignon diamonds, and their comet-like birds of paradise ! One night last winter, I had the courage to stay supper ; and before me there was a dish of beef-steaks and fried potatoes, perfectly horrific to a Parisian elegante silting near me (who, I found afterwards, was the wife of a glove-maker, in the Rtiede la Paix). ' Que voulez vous, ma chere!' said her companion, ' C'est pour les dames Anglaises. Les Anglaises, voyez vous, ne sauraient souper sans bis tek.' \" \" We had no Americans, then, at Ihe ball last night?\" said I, ad dressing my friend Lady Poyntz, Ihe wife ofa Tory ex-minister. \" What ball ?\" she inquired, rousing herself from a reverie. \" At the Tuileries.\" \" Was there a ball at the Tuileries? \" \" Yes, a splendid one.\" \" I know nolhing about Louis Philippe's entertainments. I have not been at the Tuileries these six years.\" \" You were fortunate,\" said I, \" lhat the noise of such a multitude of carriages passing under your windows in the Rue de Rivoli, did not reveal the secret to you.\" I begin to feel myself unworthy of the select comites of Paris so ciety, such as Lady Harriet's. I am told they are the only ones in the civilized world, where what deserves lo be called conversation still exists; yet I never heard anything more vapid than the eternal repe tition of \u2014 \" votre sante a ete bonne depuis que j'ai eu I'honneurde vous voirl \u2014 Votre char mante amie, miladi (une telle), etc., se porle bien? \u2014 'Comment avez vous trouve la Grisi /tier au soir ? \u2014 etc., etc.\" By way of conversational society, give me a sirst-rale English dinnerparty, or a pleasant party in an English country-house ! But, by way of gaiety, let me have a brilliant ball of several hundred per-"], [319, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 143 sons, with good music, where every one talks to every one as much or as litlle as they please. I detest a petit comite of languid ineffables. It is thought highly indecorous in Paris to sit conversing above a certain lime with the same person. Every gentleman addresses in lurn every lady of his acquaintance ; and even, where a liaison actu ally and notoriously subsists, it would be considered an insult to so ciety to render it publicly observable by undue attentions. Married couples living, however unhappily, together, appear so far togelher in public, that the mari escorts Madame inlo Ihe ball-room, and back to her carriage. It is unnecessary to address each other in the course of the evening ; still less to parade together, arm-in-arm, after the Darby-and-Joan custom of the English. They appear in society to pay their compliments lo the world ; their compliments to each other are supposed lo be paid at home. The domestic virtues of the Pari sians are at a low ebb. But this is studiously concealed. No people can be more attentive lo the external decencies of life. Chez nous, a woman giddily inclined chooses the most public places to exhibit her indiscretions; \u2014 the park, the Opera, Almack's, Kensington Gardens; \u2014 she seems to think it a pity that the influence of her bad example should be lost. This arises from Ihe fact that Eng lishmen do not err deliberately, but become entangled in mischief from weakness and self-reliance. The Frenchman goes seriously to work, and is therefore studious not to provoke observation. \"I hear great mention, among you English ladies, of the word 'flirtation,'\" said an old French gentleman de I'ancien regime to me the other day. \"I am often told, \u2014 'such a lady is perfectly well conducted, but she is fond of a little innocent flirtation ;' Qu'est-ce que ca veut dire \u2014 flirtation ?' \" The Anglicism was somewhat difficult to explain ; but, when I had wasted some eloquence on the attempt, he replied\u2014\" Ah! vous vou lez faire entendre de la coquetterie sans resullat ? \u2014 a sort of thing to us incomprehensible ! \u2014 In affairs of love, we are matter of fact. Our marriages are seldom, as in your country, marriages of inclina tion; yet we can boast an infinite number of virtuous and faithful wives. But a woman is either faithful to her husband, or takes a lover. II faut opter. If the latter, she is doubly careful to give no umbrage to her husband by levity of demeanour. If, after being faithless to her husband, she becomes faithless to her lover, she is re garded in society as a femme galante, and ceases to be respectable. Pardon me, I speak plainly ; but my position as a grandfather entitles me to explain these things to a stranger.\" And thus their code of immorality seems to be deliberately esta- blished; partly, I imagine, in consequence ofthe impossibility of di vorce, and partly because, in case of convicted unchastity, a lady is"], [320, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 144 liable in France to imprisonment, and is made to contribute from her own means towards the support of the children she has abandoned. \"You are so strange, \u2014 you insulaires .'\" cried my Baden friend, Madame de Nivelles, when discussing with me some point of morality. \"You are fond of holding forth as if all the virtue in the world had taken refuge in Great Britain. But took at the fact!\u2014 look at the records of your newspapers ! \u2014 look at your divorce trials.'' \"Three or four instances in the year,\" said I, \" out of a population of seven millions, and vulgarly blazoned forth to the utter demoraliza tion of Ihe public.\" \" N'importel\" she interrupted. ' ' All that is thus recorded is fact! A miladi rushes from the arms of one milor into those of another; number 2 paying a large fine (according to legal tariff) to number 1. The miladi has only to change her name, her liveries, the arms on her carriage, and add a ball more or less to the coronet in the corner of her pocket handkerchief; \u2014 and, Vive le divorce! all goes on as before.\" \" Pardon me,\" I exclaimed, \u2014 \"such a woman has forfeited caste at once and for ever ! \u2014 she is no longer received either at court or in society.\" \" Bah, bah ! \u2014 not in London society. But she comes abroad. She is the lawful wife of a milor, and, except to the fetes of your Am bassadors, is entitled to go every where. She has France, Italy, Germany, at her disposal ; que voulez-vous ? I have seen half-a dozen of your divorcees in the best company ; but, with us, a woman once driven in shame from her husband's house is received into no other.\" Interrupted by letters from England. Welcome interruption ! \u2014 That most unamiable being, Sir Robert Herbert, has died sudden ly, and Herbert and Armine come into the family estate and twelve thousand a year ! \u2014 If ever woman merited prosperity it is my good unselfish sister ; \u2014 she will know how to enjoy and improve the ho nours of affluence. They will now quit Redfordshire and settle in our beloved old neighbourhood! \u2014 With them, I shall return to the haunts of my youth, \u2014 the silver Trent, \u2014 andNeedwood! \u2014 I had al ready determined not to visit London this season, I shall have had enough of dissipation before I quit Paris ; but Armine invites me to see them early in the summer, and the invitation is, I own, a tempt ing one. To-day, for the first lime, a seance in the Chambre des De putes. A ticket for the diplomatic tribune insured me somewhat more agreeable accommodation than in the old ventilator. As for the per formances of the day, with my best endeavours to regard the affair with becoming gravity, I could not avoid being struck by a thousand"], [321, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 145 absurdities. The hall is in itself dignified and senatorial. But the President with his little muffin-bell,\u2014 the rostrum, to which, in any sudden emergency of interest, the members cling like a swarm of bees to fight for possession ;\u2014 above all, the total inattention of the Chamber to the ordinary run of Speakers, amazed my weak mind. The French are the worst listeners in the world ; fifty liltle vehe ment debates are perpetually carrying on among the benches of the two parties to which the Speaker on his legs does not belong. They lend their ears only to those of their own way of thinking ; the right side and centre have no ears for the eloquence of the cote gauche. This is certainly one way of preserving consistency of opinion. Then, their excess of vehemence, without the slightest appearance of being in earnest ! In the English House, how little demonstration of fervour, but how convincing a tone of sincerity ! Here Ihey speak out of the abundance of the heart; there, out of its depths. Ever and anon, when the fifty little contingent parliaments grew too inso lently noisy, dingle-dingle-ding went the little bell of Monsieur le President, and order was for a few minutes restored. I came away weary and unexcited, before the seance was half over, feeling as if I had been in the presence of a disputatious academy, rather than of the legislature of the nation. I fancied, \u2014 no doubt it was fancy, \u2014 lhat I could discern a peculiar distinction between Ihe characteristics of the deputies from the south, and those of northern France. Thiers appears, in spite of his bad delivery, to be a ready and adroit ministe rial speaker ; but in the tribune, as elsewhere, he cannot divest him self of his air gamin. What does Henry Bulwer mean by the assertion lhat literary men are more eagerly welcomed in society here than in England? They occupy, perhaps, a more independent and honourable position, \u2014 are less exposed to being lionized by patronizing dowagers, and more sure of obtaining public preferment ; but, with the exception of Mignet and Merimee, who are courted for their personal merits and official standing, rather lhan for their literary distinctions, I have scarcely met one of them. To the parties of the ministers, of the Grand Re ferendaire, and other public functionaries, artists and men of letters areadmilted, as part ofa political system; but they are not to be found, like Moore, Rogers, Chantry, Newton, and others, in the boudoirs of the elite, or Ihe select fetes ofa Devonshire House. The calling of un homme de lettres is here, however, a profession, bearing its own rewards and profits, and forming an especial and inde pendent class. In common with the artists, they look lo ennoblement in the Academy, and, under the existing order of things, have been richly endowed with places and pensions; but among themselves, in Iheir domestic privacy, their habits of life are on the whole inferior 10"], [322, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 146 in refinement to those ofthe literary classes of England. It is true Lhat, of late years, literature has been cultivated among ourselves as one of the highest graces of the aristocracy; while a considerable number of the ornaments of our schools of learning, devoting them selves to the church, attain high clerical preferment. In England, a great historian or moral philosopher achieves the golden honours of lawn sleeves; while, in France, he obtains an habit brode, a croix d'honneur, a pension, and the honours of the Academy. The Car lists possess Chateaubriand and De Vigny among the literati; but the venerable Celadon of Madame Recamier owes his importance in their eyes rather lo his political distinction lhan to the authorship of \"Atala.\" Lamartine's fame, as a first-rate poet, has been injured by his deca dence into a second-rate senator. Victor Hugo is a harsh, dry, self concentrated man, inflated into bombast by Ihe worship of the roman tic school. Balzac is the only Frenchman of talent who condescends lo lionize in fashionable society: and, of female writers, though se veral might be cited as accomplished and elegant, the French have nothing comparable in importance wilh an Edgeworth, a Martineau, a Joanna Baillie, or a Mitford. One woman of genius, Ihe female Byron of la jeune France, must not be passed over in silence ; but, luckily for the honour of her sex, Madame Dudevant is so ashamed of herself and her works, as to mask them under the assumed appel lation of \"Georges Sand.\" I noticed the profile of this talented woman in the collection of eminent persons among Ihe medals of David: the eyes and forehead are strikingly handsome \u2014 the mouth animaldtre and coarse \u2014 half a Circe \u2014 half a muse. 1 have lately been trying to investigate the nature ofthe charm which renders Paris so favourite a sojourn of the English. In point of gaiety (for gaiety, reading dissipation) it affords nothing comparable with that of London. A few ministerial fetes every winter may per haps exceed in brilliancy the balls given in our common routine of things; but, for one entertainment in Paris, at least thirty take place chez nous. Society is established with us on a wider and more splendid scale. The weekly soirees, on the other hand, which pro perly represent Ihe society of this place, are dull, meagre, and formal to the last degree of formality. There is no brilliant point de reunion such as Almack's; no theatre uniting, like our Italian Opera, the charm of the best company, the best music, and the best dancing. Of the thousand and one theatres boasted by the Parisians, only three are of a nature to be frequented by people of consideration ; the re mainder being as much out of question as the Pavilion or the Garrick. Dinner-parties there are none ; waler-parties, none ; dejeuners, un less given by a foreign ambassadress, none. A thousand accessories lo London amusement are here wholly wanling. In the month of"], [323, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 147 May, I am told, the public gardens and the Boisde Boulogne become enchanting. But what is not charming in the month of May? Paris, perhaps, least of all places ; for, at the commencement of the month, every French family of note quits the metropolis for its country-seat, or for sea or mineral bathing. Foreigners and the mercantile and ministerial classes alone remain. La finance et la lureaucratie ! triste ressource ! What, then, I would discover, constitutes the peculiar merit of in ducing persons uninstigated by motives of economy, to fix themselves in this comfortless and filthy city, and call it Paradise ? Alas ! my solution of the problem is far from honourable to the taste of our ab sentees ! In Paris people are far less amenable than in London to the tribunal of public opinion. The custom of living in suites of apartments, either in a public hotel or a furnished house, renders people independent to the surveillance of their servants and of each other. Among the well-regulated esta blishments of a good street in the better quarters of London, every action, every gesture, every visit received or refused, is known and commented upon, not only by your next-door neighbours, but by the super-abounding, and therefore idle, servants of a dozen others. The lazy butler of No. 36, yawning on the door-steps during Ihe daily drive of his lady, and comparing notes with his brother corkscrews of No. 35 and No. 37, has nothing better to do than communicate intel ligence of my lady's flirtations, or my lord's unpaid bills, to be circu lated round the neighbourhood. In Paris he would be dusling chairs or washing china ; for not a hand that is not super-abundantly tasked is retained in a French establishment. Personal allusions, moreover, are inadmissible into the newspapers. No vulgar appetite prevails for learning the number of guests or entrees at the dinner of the Marquis of This or Baron the Other \u2014 the fiddle faddle particulars of ladies' toilets, or the comings and goings of the aristocracy, and aristocracy-aping mediocracy. There is infinitely less of the servile spirit of lackeyism among the middling and lower orders. A French haberdasher knows what the journals of the day relate as the last firman of the grand signor, but cares not a rush whether the noble duke lodged in the first floor over his shop, is married or single, or about to commit matrimony ; while the French footman talks to the frotteur, dry-rubbing your apartments, of the order of the day in the Chamber, or the pictures at the Exposition, instead of Ihe improprieties he may have noticed while lounging away Ihe night in the hall at Willis's. Even in the most frivolous society, conversation rarely takes a per sonal lone. Scandalous gossip is regarded as eminently vulgar. The men talk politics \u2014 the women, dress \u2014 seldom or ever, the affairs of 10\""], [324, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 148 their neighbours. Whether public morals derive improvement from this security from that minor, yet influential public tribunal,\u2014 the voice of society,\u2014 may perhaps be doubtful ; but it is certain lhat not a few of the English are well content to be emancipated from the obligato suit of buckram worn in London, and the hypocrisy induced by the consciousness of being always under review\u2014 always perched upon a judgment-stool\u2014 always subjected to the scrutiny of the stew- ard's room, the servants' hall, ihe malignalions of the fashionable school for scandal, and the branding-irons of the weekly press I Peerages, baronetages, magazines, annual registers, render the United Kingdom familiar wilh the births, deaths, and marriages\u2014 Ihe divorces and delinquencies \u2014 nay, even the balls and masquerades, of the pri- vileged classes of our own country. In France, each lives secure from observation in his hotel, as a marmot in his burrow, till some escutcheoned hearse, ascending to the heights of Pere la Chaise, pro- claims to the cobler who for thirty years has mended shoes as porter lo the mansion adjoining that of the defunct, lhat sa seigneurie, his neighbour, is no more! I should have known nothing of the mis adventures of the Gresham Ronshams, had we lived side by side in the Rue de l'Universile, where things are established on too vast a scale for neighbourly espionage; nor would Fieschi ha\"e been ena bled to build up his atrocious battery unobserved, in a lodging-house in Piccadilly. Just received a charming leiter from Herbert, enforcing with every possible argument his wise's invitations for Ihe summer. \" I am per suaded,\" he writes, \" that what may have appeared to you a morose, unkindly humour on my part, has tended to create estrangement be tween us. Of this, believe me, my dear Harriet, you will have no further cause for complaint. You, who have perhaps experienced all the vexations of life, saving the sting of that gnawing worm called poverty, are wholly unable to appreciate the wear and tear of temper produced by Ihe petty mortifications it induces. You cannot figure to yourself the humiliation of a man united to the wife of his choice, the object of his idolatry ; and compelled, instead of surrounding her with the luxuries and elegancies of life, to preach a thrifty economy, and mingle in the endearments of their privacy arguments upon the waste of the kilchen, or the gluttony of the servants' hall. To have fair and promising children born to you, and know Iheir prospects insecure, \u2014 even their means of education circumscribed, \u2014 is a bitter trial. You have seen me smarting under such feelings \u2014 smartingunder unavowed embarrassments hateful to a man of honourable principles ; but you will see all Ihis no more. Our golden age is begun.

Come to us, my dear Harriet, and witness all Ihis. Dread no more lectures; I shall be too busy inculcating lessons of happiness, to trouble myself with lessons of wisdom.\" This is indeed a cheering prospect, not for my projected visits, which remain among things Utopian, but for my dear sister, the best, because the least selfish, of human creatures. And of my own avenir? Alas! I do not yet venture on anticipations. Let me first thoroughly recover my self-possession; let the wounds of my pride be thoroughly cica trised ; and then, new prospects and new resolutions ! Revenons a nos papiltons. It is edifying lo perceive wilh regard to Carlism, as with regard to all other extremes of bigotry, lhat affec tation and prejudice have begotten their ownpunishment. The French are not intrinsically a loyal nation. Their royalism is not the illus tration of a scriptural precept, \"Fear God \u2014 honour the king,\" for they adore Mary Mother ralher lhan their Maker, and honour Ver sailles and the Tuileries rather than the Father of the People. They love the pomp and glitter of the throne ; cling to the abdicated dynasty rather as an evidence of ban ton than from any better motive, choosing it to be supposed that their ancestors were courtiers of the elder Bour bons, and that gratitude necessitates their faithful adherence to the race. Hence, an infinite number of ancestorless pretenders assume the name of Carlists as a warranty of their equivocal nobility. Men whose fortunes were amassed during the pillage of the first revolution, orby speculations prospering under the empire, nay, deriving their revenues from the profits of public gaming-tables, affect allegiance to the cause of legitimacy, as a plea for improving their circle of society by making their houses a point of re-union for the Carlist party, most of whom are too poor, and many too timid, to render their hos pitality a rallying point for the seditious. Several distinguished circles have been formed by obscure and worse than obscure individuals, under such auspices. Even a low-bred American, accidenlaily en riched, has bought his way to prominence by permilling certain Carlist dignitaries to entertain their friends at his expense. Among Ihe first to overwhelm this rash Timon of a new Athens with ridicule, are the parties so largely indebted to his weakness. \" What would you have?\" they exclaim ; \"it would expose us to the persecutions of the police were we to unite under our roofs the distinguished members of our parly. These obscure people are liable lo no such interpretation. Monsieur Persil would find it difficult to promote a Yankee democrat inlo any emissary of the legitimate party, Under such auspices we are safe !\""], [326, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 150 Aster all, this is but a modification ofthe acquaintance-brokerage I formerly stigmatized in London. A chacun, ses travers ! There exists, by the way, in Paris, but a single fashionable club, which, having been founded at the period of the Restoration, is com posed in a great measure of Carlists, systematically illiberal towards the English.

This illustrious artist is said to have been born in the palace of Versailles, when Versailles was a royal residence ; though, during the gorgeous triumphs of the empire, his star shone subdued by the bri liancy of that of Le Roi (\" le roi des modes,\"), to rise at last in utmost glory with the sun of the Bourbons. To his genius, the Court of Louis XVIII. and his successor was indebted for half its attractions; nor would the tears of le petit Chateau have ever ceased to flow for the loss of Madame, had not Louis Philippe, by a master-stroke of genius, retained Herbault the unique, as milliner of the new Court of the new Queen. The day preceding every royal gala is passed by Her bault au Chateau, arranging the diamonds of her Majesty and the Princesses on their dresses, and imprinting on the very hem of their garments Ihe impress of pure legitimacy \u2014 for the mighty master is a zealous devotee of courtliness. No one so nicely discriminates between \u25a0 ' fair comme ilfaut,\" ' ' fair distingue, \" ' ' fair noble,\" ' ' un port de reine,\" and \" une pose impe'riale ;\" no one so scrupulously avoids giving to the toque of a femme de la banque the turn of feather becom ing the Ambassadress of Imperial Austria. He is M. A. or rather LL.D. in the arcana of the toilet, a man of science as well as a man of genius. Hear him discuss the comparative qualities of the ostrich of Syria, the ostrich of Senegal, the ostrich of the Cape,\u2014 and old Pennant the ornithologist is outdone. No wonder that Dantan should have immortalised Herbault the First and Last by one of the cleverest of his statuettes \\"], [327, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 151 Herbault and Victorine are, however, the only remaining classicists of the School of Fashion. All that Hugo and Dumas have done towards the corruption of literature, has been effected in the reign of la mode by Palmyre, Beaudrant, and their imitators. Exaggerations have crept in under the sanction of these people ; and were it not for the tone of absolutism with which Herbault maintains his ascendency over the wavering minds of his belle clientelle, chaos would come again, and a renewal of the monstrosities of the incroyables betray the innovations upon moral order, inevitable in the divided kingdom of a citizen King. Long live Herbault ! Whatsoever King may reign, let the legitimacy ofthe toilet remain unpolluted ! In no country in Europe is the infallibility of the Head of the Fashion so important as in France. England is a land of originals; and in dress, as in all other matters, people consult their whims and fancies. A Frenchwoman's sole fancy is to follow the fashion, \u2014 the fashion, for it is one and indivisible. Herbault sixes the \"mould of form\" sor summer bonnets at the Easter promenade of Longchamps; and thence forward, to attempt any other shape, would be flat blasphemy. A world of trouble and invention is spared. From the exclusive down to Ihe humblest grisette, the rule is made absolute. In France it would be as vulgar to affect a deviation from the general law, as in England tamely to submit. lam at a loss, however, to determine what constitutes the undeniable superiority of a Frenchwoman in the art of the toilet ; unless, as I suspect, it consists in excessive neatness. Every point of her costume is exact and precise. However simple the materials, the dress fits to a miracle. Not a plait is out of its place, not a rumple discernible : the glove, the shoe, the stocking all are equally well fitting;\u2014 every hair ofthe coiffure is carefully adjusted, and the quilling ofthe snow-white cap scrupulously symmetrical. You never find, as in the case of a showily-dressed Englishwoman, a superfluous bow of ribbon stuck on to cover the fissure of an ill-fitted waist; or a fine chain or broach as sumed to smarten up a dress whose freshness is tarnished ; while crushed flowers or soiled ribbons are sins beyond forgiveness. French women are careful of their belongings, and, possessing scarcely a fourth part of the finery with which we overload our wardrobe, are always fresh and spotless. \u2022 It is no discredit to them to be seen at half-a dozen successiveballs in the same gown ; and they are, consequently, secure from the vexa tion of appearing in it in successive seasons. This prudent limitation enables them to be always in the fashion. It is the custom of the lower orders in England to exclaim, when a woman is rouged to excess, or attired in glaring colours,-\" took at lhat Frenchified piece of goods !\" Of the sins of Ihe Parisian belles"], [328, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 152 of former days I sing not ; but, at present, nothing can exceed the modesty of fashionable costume. Except at balls, an elegante never appears in full dress ; and her demi-toilette and morning dress are re markable only for a deficiency of ornament. The only women I have noticed here as wearing rouge are countrywomen of my own ; nor was I ever before aware of the meretricious and most unlovely aspect imparted by false colours to even the loveliest countenance. I speak not in a moral sense ; for whether a woman waste three or sour hours in adjusting the niceness of her dress and the brightness of her hair, or, after a hasty toilet, apply a coat of rouge upon her cheek, Ihe im pulse of coquetry must be (he same. But paint is a positive defeature; it imparts a glassy look to the eyes and a doll-like vulgarity lo the face. If the catalogues of the perfumers' shops of Paris are to be credited wilh their enumeration of creme de concombres, and creme de limacons, cosmetics are as much in use here as among the London votaries of Kalydor and Macassar oil ; \u2014 but at least the sin of the whited wall is wanting. I went to-night through the ceremony of what is called a visite de digestion, at the weekly soiree, or reception of the ministre de . What a penalty is entailed by this custom of opening your house weekly, lo afford to all and sundry who can pretend, in the most remote degree, to the honours of acquaintance or official collision, an opportunity of intruding uninvited into your society ! The ministerial soirees include of necessity so unsatisfactory an assemblage, that the visits of those persons whose presence would be really acceptable, are rare and brief ; while people sufficiently small to find their consequence augmented by being seen under a ministerial roof, omit not a single occasion of courting a formal bow from l'homme en place. There were about a dozen ladies to-night, most of them wives of leading de puties or other specialises, and nearly three hundred men. No re freshments \u2014 nothing but talkee-talkee, \u2014 adorned by lhat flourishing arabesque of compliment which overruns the discourse of these silver tongued iron-hearted people. I observed a vast number of artists and men of letters; not holding, however, the dignified attitude assigned Ihem in such society as lhat of Landsdowne House, the pendant to that assembled chez monsieur le ministre. I doubt, by the way, whether if the custom of voluntary evening visits were admitted in London, such parties would present the orderly lone and aspect they present in Paris. Manners predominate here over morals ; and even Robert Macaire in his rags knows how to present himself in society. A distinguished doctrinaire deputy amused himself by upbraiding me this evening with the delinquencies of Mrs. Trollope and her book on Paris. \" Icannol but conclude,\" said he, \" thai Ihelameof this new work,"], [329, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 153 as well as of that on America, is based on the cleverness of Hervieu's sketches ; for I find that those the Trollope has published unilluslraled, are admitted to be failures.

One ofthe recreations brought into vogue here by foreigners (chiefly by the English), consists in des diners de cabaret, as they are quali fied, after the fashion of the re'gence. It is true that among the middling classes, a third of the population dine habitually at the re staurants; but even the fine ladies have been allured to the Rocher de Cancale, by the dinners of soixante francs la te'te, given by Lord Hart ford and other travelling Amphytrions. Yesterday I was present at one of these dinners ; the mere cuisine of which is rivalled only by three or four private houses in London. The service was admirably good, for a restaurant \u2014 but deficient, of course, in the refinements and comforts of a private house. The fish course, which established the fame of the Rocher, struck me as far inferior to that of Lovegrove; but I was informed by Mr. de Rawdon, an English attache versed in such mailers, that the wine, here, is no less pre-eminent. After all, there is something objectionable in the idea of elegant women quilting their decent homes, and visiting an eating-house in one of the dirtiest parts of Paris, for the sake of a few well-dressed dishes ; and as for the buffet of undressed fish, which it is part of the entertainment to visit, Grove's shop and Phillips', during the London season, are fifty times belter provided. The only reasonable plea in savour of the system is, lhat such dinners are usually given by fashionable bachelors, diplo matists, or dandies, having rro establishment of their own. From the dinner- table yesterday, we proceeded straight to the opera, and the evening passed off agreeably enough, with the exception that little Alfred de la Vaugyon made his attenlions so disagreeably apparent, thai for Ihe future I shall decline the honour of his visits."], [330, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 154 The French bid bold defiance to Shakspeare's axiom, that \" Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt with by attorneyship,\" matrimony being with them as much an \" affaire\" as any transacted at the Bourse. Madame de Bretonvilliers, who visited me to-day, ac counted for being in higher spirits than usual, by informing me that she had just arranged a charming marriage for her niece Malvina de Rochmore, with the young Prince of Aspern. \" Is Mademoiselle de Rochmore much attached to the prince?\" said I, with perfect naivete. \" Attached ? Quelle horreur !\" cried the Marchioness. \" With us a young lady presuming to entertain a passion would be considered lost. Malvina has never seen the Prince. She is still at the convent of tho Sacre C\u0153ur; and her father, the Duke, being a widower, it is at my house the wedding will take place,\" \" And the courtship!\" said I. \" Courtships, chez nous are, very differently managed from those of your country. Malvina arrives at my house to-morrow ; and hencefor- ward the Prince will present himself there every evening, among the rest of my visitors. At the end of a week or ten days I shall interro- gate my niece. Should there exist no repugnance on her side, (which is scarcely possible, for Aspern is very amiable et de tres bonnes facons, and, being unacquainted with any other man, no previous impression can have been made) the arrangements will proceed. As her avowed fiance, every evening the Prince will present Malvina with a bouquet; and before the end of the month, the signature du contrat will take place, \u2014 a ceremony to which I have the honour of inviting you ; im- mediately afterwards, the wedding, the diners de famille; and I shall have the happiness of beholding my niece settled in one of the finest hotels in Paris, immediately adjoining my own.\" \"But should Mademoiselle de Rochmore admit a seeling of re pugnance?\" ' ' In lhat case, the negociations, which are known only to ourselves, would be immediately broken off. But it is not likely. Malvina has been admirably brought up ; she has a delicate and seeling mind, sully alive to the advantages of a match proposed for her by the tender fore sight of her father, on whose judgment she has perfect reliance. You can scarcely imagine how much we French are revolted by the manners of English young ladies, who go rambling in ball-rooms, flirting (as they call it) with this man, and laughing familiarly with that ; refusing or accepting proposals, and at length, perhaps, informing their parents thai their affections, or even their hands, are engaged.\" \"Remember,\" said I, \"thatthese proceedings lake place under the"], [331, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 155 observation and sanction of their parents, who are on the spot to in terfere should any objectionable acquaintance arise.\" \" But what man of sense,\" said the Marchioness, \" would seek a wife in one who for years has been on the look-out for lovers and a husband, and, before she makes her election, must have passed through the preliminaries of half-a-dozen courtships ! \u2014 Shocking ! \u2014 Horrible!\" \" Instead of which,\" I retorted, piqued, in my turn, \" it is after marriage that you Parisians incur a similar peril, Croyez-moi, both systems are open to objection ; and each is best adapted to the customs of the country iu which it has arisen.\" I did not admit lo Madame de Bretonvilliers what I cannot disguise from myself, that my countrywomen have only too readily adopted the system of \" attorneyship\" in their matrimonial arrangements on the continent. In France no woman is loo old, too ugly, too odious, to be beset by suitors, provided she possess les ecus. The smallest fortune has its adorers; but a widow with a good jointure, or a demoiselle with a handsome dot, is sure to be the object of a thousand speculations. A woman who for ten preceding years, had been consigned in London to the bench of Dowagers, arrives in Paris to be courted as a partner in the ball-room, previously to being sought as a bride ; and, the dormant spirit of coquetry thus re-awakened, these elderly dames are apt to play fantastic tricks before high heaven, and eventually become the prey of some adventurer. Unless where prudent relatives are at hand to examine into the pretensions of the aspirant, the assiduities of a French suitor ought to be very cautiously accepted. Those of Alfred de la Vauguyon are, I am aware, addressed solely to the beaux yeux de ma cassette ; but so would it be were he lo form a connexion with the most illustrious family in France ; and, though not rich, his parchments thrown inlo the scale will probably secure him an alliance with some heiress of the financial class, whose gold servira d dorer I'e'cusson no bilissime des Vauguyons. A ball chez le due d'Orleans! I should be sorry, could any reasonable being be aware how anxious I felt for an invitalion, which is considered here equivalent to a diploma of beauty. The handsome heir-apparent desires, naturally enough, to have his fetes graced with the presence ofall the pretty women in Paris; and the candidates are proportionably numerous. All honour, however, to his Royal High ness's discrimination !\u2014 the ball was perfect ! The Duke's apartment, which occupies a portion of the palace distinct from that of their Ma jesties, is furnished in the style of la renaissance, with a choice se lection from the royal Garde Meulle, and gleanings from all the curiosity shops in Paris. The Duke of Orleans has also a charming collection of paintings and sculpture, by modern artists, of whom he is the liberal patron. His tastes are elegant, and, for a handsome young Prince of"], [332, "156 DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. four-and-twenty, not more frivolous than might be expected; includ- ing one or two \" eternal passions\" in the course of every season, and the best racing stud in France. All this would sit better perhaps on an English lordling than on the heir apparent of so turbulent a monarchy as the citizen-kingdom of France: for a \"jeune homme comme il faut\" is a \"jenne Prince comme il nefautpas ; but his is an heirship- apparent at best presumptive, and, I fear, apocryphal. En attendant, vive Monseigneur le Due d' Orleans, the best ball-giver in Europe! I Agreed to accompany Madame de Merinville and half a dozen other women of equally unimpeachable fashion, en part iefine, to the bai de I'opera, escorted by a sufficient number of cavaliers, prudently selected from among their fathers and uncles, to defy the breath of calumny. There was an affectation of mystery in the business, although our pro- ject was known to half our acquainlance; but, as Madame de Merin- ville retained her box, we were sure of a retreat in case the ball should prove too crowded or too gay. I have been so long accustomed to con- nect Ihe idea of a masked ball at the opera wilh the scandalous anecdotes of French memoirs, lhat I experienced a consciousness of having em- barked in a silly adventure. As far, however, as my own observation enables me to decide, good order and discretion prevail at the lal de I'opera as much as in thechurch ofSt. Roch ! Instead of being \" pleasant, but wrong,\" the thing is dull and decorous. Men are only admitted unmasked, ladies in a close black domino, which, assimilating all shapes and ages, rendered us unrecognizable. A foot and hand, bien chausse et lien gante, form the sole distinction between belle and belle. My ve- nerable escort, and uncle of my friend Madame de Merinville, informed me lhat the propriety of the lal de I'opera (which he was pleased lo call ils decadence) dales from the establishment of Musard's balls, which take place twice a week in the Faubourg St. Honore, as a focus for the demoralization of leau monde and low monde. There, even the fine gentleman appears masked and en polisson, and the results are such as lo preclude the presence of even the'least prudish woman of character. Such is the egout which is said lo have purified the masked balls of Ihe opera. I proposed to Madame de Merinville, at Lady Harriet Snipsnap's request, to include her Ladyship in our little party, and was not a 1 1 tile mortified lo be refused. \" Nem'envottlez-ias, ma chere,' said she, \"mais votre miladi est une femme aux aventures. On this point, our Queen, like your own, is difficult. Miladi Harrietle is not of our society at the Chateau, and it would not suit me to be seen at her house, or have her seen at mine. D'ailleurs, charm ante femme ; but loo much talked of.\" After being compelled to convey this refusal, \u2014 however caulionsly worded, ungracious enough,\u2014 I thought it right to attend L.idy Har-"], [333, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 157 riet's next soiree, when, my attention being awakened on the subject, I certainly did notice that her coterie consisted of persons, like the articles displayed at some great china sale in London, damaged or defective : a family (or a tea-set) mis-matched by the unsatisfactory disappearance of a daughter (or a cream-ewer) , or an elderly roue (or vase), wilh the gilding worn off. There are, however, so few English houses of consideration open a jour fixe in Paris, that Lady Harriet's retains a certain vogue, particularly wilh certain persons desirous of meeting certain other persons, and uncertain of an elsewhere. To night, to my great amazement, as I sat gossipping with Lady Harriet, who possesses the fluent glibness of discourse peculiar lo one who has passed twenty years en causeries, in came the Duke of Merioneth, arrived only this evening in Paris, and coming to note his arrival at Lady Harriet's Exchange, as a merchant might have done at Lloyd's. He appeared at once delighted to see me, and vexed to see me there. The Duke has been passing the autumn at his place in Wales, sur rounded by his own family, so that he could tell me nothing of those concerning whom I was most anxious to hear. His inquiries of my self plainly proved that he has made himself acquainted with all my proceedings since I quitted England. He seemed as much au fait of every particular of my travels as my courier. The Duke's jour ney hither seems to have been a sudden movement, but he will be an addition to society. We have a variety of English personages in Paris this winter, all having their own orbits and pursuits, and contributing little to the general amusement. They have introduced the detest able custom of great dinners, which lire out one's spirits without plea sure or profit. Pozzo di Borgo's house, by the way, is said to be a greal loss to so- ciety ; but I meet every night several striking Russian beauties, who are supposed to play the same parts in Paris which Alexander de- spatched one of the fairest of his Court to enact at that of Napoleon. Aslill more captivating woman is one who might pass alternately for Russian, English, French, Italian, German, or Spanish; a perfect lin- guist, an accomplished artist, a clever musician, and, better lhan all, a pretty woman \u2014 who sways the world of diplomats and dandies, not wilh a rod of iron, but a rod of loadstone,\u2014 nay, perhaps a divining rod, for many believe there must be magic in her influence. An ob ject'of spite to her own sex, all the world, on arriving here, is put on its guard against her wiles, yet all the world entangles itself in the piquante Countess's net as blindly as if the warning had been spared 1 I cannot, however, forgive any thing that is young and pretly for -soiling its taper fingers with the dirty work of politics ! Let our sex"], [334, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 158 glory in the public triumphs of fathers, husbands, brothers, lovers ; but the successes to be conquered by back-stairs influence, the mole like mining and counter-mining of petty intrigue, are a vile species of contrelande, and unworthy the purity of feminine nature. I am assured lhat the animosities of politics have greatly abated dur ing the last two years. Still, there are certain circles in Paris which greatly resemble the hustings of an English election ; and when some new deserter sneaks over to the enemy, i. e. some Carlist beauty ap pears at one of the balls of the Chateau, fearful is the hue and cry raised after the delinquent. In vain does she plead the fruillessness of resistance to the established order of things, Ihe example of those older and wiser than herself, the necessity of opening a career for her hus band and children ; political partisans are animals which give tongue, but give no ear. One of the grand secrets of this vehemence of political zeal is want of occupation. The education of such Frenchwomen as were born at the early period of the great Revolution, was of necessity neglected; and those ignorantissimes, who have now attained to middle age, having nothing learned and nothing forgotten, ' ' throw themselves\" into politics, just as formerly elles se seraient jetees dans la devotion. Some doting peer or displaced preset occupies the post formerly as signed to the Pi_re Directeur, and their bigotry takes only a minor ob ject for its idolatry. The uncultivated minds of such women are easily overmastered by a ruling passion which they mistake for a ruling prin ciple ; and happy those of the rising generation, who, if ungifted with faculties applicable lo the highest purposes of study, are at least trained to devote their leisure hours to music, drawing, and les arts d'agre mens, so as to secure them against the possession of lhat particularly evil spirit, the genius of political intrigue ! I never yet saw a female saint, or a female politician, who had not taken up her vocation in the want of rational employment. The Duke of Merioneth left his name for me this morning ; and to-night I met him au concert d la cour, to which I accompanied Madame de Merinville. These concerts are admirably arranged ; I never heard a better selection of music. The invitations are issued so as to distinguish the non-dancing part of the community, as far as the petits la/s distinguish (he dancers ; but on the whole they are less ex clusive than the private balls. This is the sirst appearance of the Duke of Merioneth at the court of Louis Philippe ; and though a professed Liberal, I am convinced he was disturbed by compunctious visitings, at finding himself the guest of the successor of Charles X. ; nay, I pre dict that, during his stay here, he will mechanically re-enrol himself under Ihe banners, of the noble faubourg. His Grace will be diverted by hearing of a conquest I have effected in that seventh heaven of"], [335, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 159 heraldry. Two evenings ago, jusl as I was dressed for Lady Harriet's, I received a visit of ceremony from Madame de Brelonvilliers, to ten der matrimonial overtures for my hand (and jointure) in the name of her respectable uncle, the old Due de Clisson, whose style and titles are said lo engross the parchment of a whole patriarchal flock ; but whose rent-roll, soit dit en passant, would lie in a nutshell. The venerable Duke affects to sind in me the tone of the vieille cour ; declares that there was an inter-alliance between the houses of Clisson and Mon tresor, in the time of Philip Augustus ; and protests that his chateau on the Durance, an old turreled barn furnished to receive Maria de Medicison her road from Tuscany to the arms of Henri IV., would be a paradise with such an Eve as Madame de Delaval for its Duchess of Clisson. Madame de Delaval knows better; and, without permit ting the Marchioness lo enter inlo financial particulars, or refer me, as she wished, for explanations to the notaire of Ihe house of Clissons, I begged to decline the honour of the alliance. She seemed to think it would have been convenient to sign the marriage contract on the same day with that of Malvina deRochemore. This morning, being bright and sunshiny, I have devoted lo sight-seeing ; to the churches of Notre Dame, so inferior to our own cathedrals of York and Lincoln ; St. Eustache, an architectural whim, conceived in the worst taste, but producing an imposing effect; St. Etienne du Mont, the most ancient and beautiful of the religious tem ples of Paris; the ill-fated Pantheon, a type of the unsoundly-based but grandly designed modern monarchy of France ; and, lastly, the Chapel of the Invalides, one of the noblest trophies of the Siecle de Louis XIV. As I admired its glorious nave, and the clever ruse by by which ils fine pavement was preserved from destruction during the revolution, I could not but place myself in the position of General Serrurier, the Governor, who received the first visit of Napoleon on his return from Elba, when he beheld the eagle eye of his former be nefactor raised to the empty space whence the banners, the trophies of ten years of victory, had been basely removed. I visited last week the city of the dead\u2014 the cemetery of Pere la Chaise; and, admitting all the charges made against it of bad taste and frivolous sentiments, could not stand unmoved in the burial-place of fifty thousand contemporaries, including so many illustrious names, so many memorable victims. Sepulchral monuments are liable, above other works of art, to the hazard of that single but fatal step, from the sublime to the ridiculous, as our own churches ot St. Paul and West minster Abbey unfortunately demonstrate. But, with the exception of Canova's monument at Vienna, to the memory of the Grand Duch ess Maria Christiana of Luxe Teschcn; Rauck's, to tho Queen of Prussia \u2022 and Conslan's, in the Cathedral of Sens, lo the Dauphin and"], [336, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 160 Dauphiness, the continent has nothing to show in rivalship wilh those of Mrs. Nightingale, in Westminster Abbey ; of Mrs. Howard, at Corby ; the Wodehouse children, at Lichfield ; or Miss Johnes Knight, at Hafod. The cemetery of Pere la Chaise is, above all, strikingly deficient in monuments. The sta,tue of General Foy, by David, is calculated for the senate-house rather lhan the sepulchre ; and all the rest on which cost and care have been bestowed, consist in mausolea of granite, closed by solid gratings, containing marble altars adorned with mas sive plate. Of one stately burying-place (honourably mentioned by Madame Trollope) some curious anecdotes are recorded. The Mus covite lord of the lady to whose remains it is dedicated, one of the richest individuals in Europe, directed, in the first outburst of conjugal grief, the purchase of a considerable piece of ground to be consecrated to her memory. Second thoughts, and the sculptor's estimate, ar rived in process of time; and, instead of devoting the whole territory to its original destination, a reasonable space was allotted to the Coun tess, and the remainder to the construction of other graves. That these should be suffered to lie tenantless seemed absurd ; and the Count, on receiving one day a visit from a favourite protege, an eminent French tragedian, who had been attached to his private theatre, presented with unexampled generosity to the astonished his trion Ihe title-deeds of a vault in the cemetry of Pere la Chaise, instead of the pension he had been fondly anticipating. Three other graves, however, remained to be disposed of ; and one morning the beautiful Countess 0 , who was dying by slow degrees of a cancer, was sound by her physician bathed in tears. \" I know I am getting rapidly worse,\" cried she, \u2014 \" I know I look shockingly to-day. That monster has been here, trying to persuade me to purchase one of his hor rible caveaux ! \" \u2014 So much for the magnanimity of the magniticos of Muscovy ! Madame de Merinville, after amusing me with this eventful history, savoured me wilh a still more scandalous anecdote connected wilh one of the favourite heroes of Madame Trollope. A lady fair, some time since an object of idolatry lo the celebrated bard so prominently bossed wilh the organ of veneration, was invited, a few summers ago, by her gentle shepherd to a partie de campagne, \u2014 an understood crisis in a French affaire de c\u0153ur. Attired in a bewitching demi toilette, the lady stepped into his ealeche, anticipating a drive in the Bois de Bou logne, to conclude, probably, with the dinner at St. Cloud or Courbe voie; and, after some hours passed in the open air, began perhaps to think with more complacency of goujons frits, or a matelote Norman de, lhan ofthe tender but airy nothings poured into her ears. But the pilgrim of the valley of Jehoshaphat was otherwise disposed ; and, in-"], [337, "DIARY OF A DESENNUY_.E. 161 stead of directing her steps towards the savoury salon of Legriel, guided her up the rough ascent of the Mont Valerien, and emphatically placed her hand upon the great iron cross of the Calvaire. \" Jurez moi sur cette croix une amitie e'lernellel \" whispered Monsieur le Vi comle lo his fair companion ; and thus ended Ihe promenade of the Genie du Christianisme with his Alala ; who found herself, on that occasion, like Monsieur Jourdain, considerably perplexed between poetry and prose. At her soiree last night, poor Madame de Brelonvilliers commenced, in her usual lone, a violent Louis-Philippic, in which the terms ca naille and polisson figured so far more freely than I thought becoming to exclusive lips, that I could not resist setting before her, lhat how ever wide be the latitude of royal toleration wilh respect to society, the Carlist set had opened its trebly-guarded portals to persons, both English and American, rejected by the society of their own countries. \" You do not enter into our views,\" was her undaunted reply. \"We meet at the hotels of the people lo whom you allude, and they have the satisfaction lo parade through apartments silled wilh the best company of the faubourg; bul they belong no further to our society lhan would a tetolum twirled in the middle of the room. We scarcely know them by sight; they scarcely know -us by name.\" I would willingly have inveighed against the meanness that conde scends lo accept hospitality on such terms, bulmy conscience upbraided me wilh as great a sin, when I remembered the system of things pre vailing in London.

Interrupted by a visit from the Duke of M., who, instead of ad mitting my usual plea lo morning visitors, \" Madame n'est pas vi sille,\" insisted upon both seeing me and being seen.

In England, the word 'old woman' is synonymous wilh ' bore,' more especially if, in addition to the sin of years, she bring the crime of celibacy ; here it would he held an offence\" against good breeding lo show slight towards a woman of any lime of life. I admit lhat the old women of Paris assume a more judicious position in society than among ourselves, where they loiter to drawing-rooms and balls, lo Ihe discredit of their gray hairs. After a certain epoch, a French woman is content to relire from the ball room, lecause she is not fated, as in England, to retire into utter soli tude. If a widow, she knows herself secure of an honourable station in the home of her married son or married daughter, or of the daily visits of her grandchildren and nieces. Every family of consideration is reunited once or twice a week \u2014 in many instances, every evening, before they disperse for Ihe enjoyment of general society \u2014 when la bonne maman or la bonne tante is consulted, caressed, and honoured, instead of being compelled, by the slights of her own family, to court the impertinence of strangers.\" \" I believe,\" rejoined the Duke of M., \" and am interested in be lieving lhat the strongest instances of fimily affection are to be found in our own country ; bul eximple might be laken wilh advantage by many from Ihe bienseance of the French. 1 admit lhat there are in stances where Ihe various members of families residing inLondon meet only as acquaintances in the common routine of society \u2014 nay, where married sisters and brothers seem to lose sight of their parents and each other \u2014 a circumstance unprecedented in France. Much of this family union of the French seems lo me lo depend on ihe peremptory manner in which pecuniary interests are adjusted by the law, lo the extinction of kinsmanly jealousy and parental favouritism, as well as on the au thority exercised by families wilh regard to the marriages of their off spring. Should the signature of parents, or surviving parent, be with held from a marriage contract, tho alliance cannot be legalized, unless by a legal process, termed a sommation respeetueuse, or summons to render an account of Ihe property and objections of the family ; \u2014 a measure rarely adopted, as it is supposed to sligmalize all parlies con cerned. On the other hand, I believe the family affection of the French to be of a more superficial character than ours. They meet daily, embrace constantly, and rarely indulge in domeslic feuds; but they are never known to exhibit those strong examples of personal de votion, of personal sacrifice, which occur in England.\" I immediately began lo quote the thousand instances, beginning wilh thai of the brothers Polignac, afforded in the course of the Revolution ; but the Duke stopped me."], [339, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE 163 \" You are talking of the French of the ancien regime,\" said he ; \" remember lhat a new moral code has since been instituted. The Parisians of 1789 are as different from those of 1839, as the English of Cromwell's time are from the courliers of his dissolute successor.\" Our didactics were interrupted by a visit from Mr. de Rawdon, with Ihe sad intelligence that Lady Sarah Andovcr, whom I left three nights ago at a ball in perfect health and the highest spirits, was at the point of death ! Though neither her friend nor inlimate acquaintance, I am, indeed, shocked by such an event occurring at such a lime. We have been running together the race ot frivolity, and are, I fear, equally un prepared for so sudden a summons ! Terrible confirmation of Mr. de Rawdon's intelligence ! Lady Sa rah is no more; \u2014 without a relative, \u2014 without a friend to comfort her, \u2014 she breathed her last. The giddy associates among whom she passed her lime missed her, and scarcely missed her, from Ihe throng \u2014 inquired \u2014 heard from the porter of the hotel lhat miladi was \" ind/'s posee,\" and inquired no more. We had been ihe companions of her pleasures ; it did not follow lhat we were to become the companions of her pains. She had been Ihe life of our coteries ; il did not follow that we were lo assemble round her bed of sickness \u2014 her bed of death! Oh 1 hollow, heartless world 1 such, such might have been my own sale, wanderer as I am in a foreign country. By her own desire her re mains are to be removed to England ; but sor which request they would have been already consigned to Ihe dust, \u2014 so eager is the haste wilh which the French thrust into the grave the encumbering object, the lifeless body, which obstructs the march of household business. This may result from the want of sympathy existing in a house of mourning inhabited by a dozen diverse families, ignorant of each other's names and qualities, and unwilling lo interrupt their pleasures in token of respect lo strangers; but it must be a cruel trial to survi vors, lo part so suddenly from all vestige of that which has been dear so long, and must be seen no more. [ passed this evening at home, alone, for the first lime since my arrival in Paris, deeply shocked by the recenl event. Bul it would seem as if I had been forewarned to attach myself to my own fireside ; for, as I sal musin\" over the precariousness of human life and human hap piness, the Duke of Merioneth again made his appearance, on pre tence of wishing lo make me acquainted wilh the melancholy particu lars of Lady Sarah's fate, but in truth on the formidable errand of asking me lo become his wife. It was impossible to make the propo sal with more feeling or more delicacy. Few men have so much to offer with their hand as tho Duke of M.\u2014 rank, wealth, and respecta bility \u2022 hut, in all honesty, I thought only of the warm heart and ho- lt*"], [340, "DIARY OF A DESENNUY--E. 164 nourable mind so fruitlessly devoted to me ; and what with the sur prise of the moment, and the shock received Ihis morning, I could not restrain my tears al the notion of the mortification I was about to in flict in a decided rejection. \" My self-love induces me to conclude,\" he observed, after Iliad fully explained myself, \" lhat your affections are already engaged ; but do not, I beseech you, imagine lhat I wish to pry into your secrets. Your preference cannot have been lightly accorded ; may it tend to your eventual happiness !\" I hoped that, wilh this kind wish, he would take his leave, for, in reply to the observation that had escaped him, it was as needless as it would have been impossible lo utter a syllable ; but, as I half rose from my chair lo bid him farewell, he added, \" There was a lime, indeed, when I fancied that Hartston, whose preference of yourself was visible to all the world, was so fortunate as to have obtained a high place in your regard.\" \" On both which points,\" I stammered, scarcely knowing what I said, \"the recent marriage of Lord Hartston must have undeceived you.\" Lord Hartston's marriage t\" reiterated the Duke, wilh a look of unfeigned surprise, \" I saw him in town the week preceding my de parture. We talked on many subjects lhat would have rendered such a communication natural, yet he did not allude lo Ihe probability of any such event. Nay, I have every reason to believe \u2014 T have almost his own declarations for my aulh*rily \u2014 that marriage was never farther from his thoughts.\" \"You do indeed surprise me,\" cried I, starlled beyond my self possession ; \" and it may serve to prove how little I am interested in the movements of your friend, that, till this moment, I believed him actually united to Lady Sophia Rossana.\" \" Lady Sophia Rossana has long been engaged to Hilton,\" observed the Duke. \" Yet, when I quitted England, Ihe report of her approaching mar riage wilh Lord Hartston was generally believed. From lhat period to this, I have made no inquiries on the subject, and concluded them to be actually married.\" \" I may therefore lay the flatering unclion lo my soul, lhat Hartston had no share in my rejection ?\" said the Duke, half interrogatively, and inlenlly regarding me. \" On such occasions,\" said I, evading his inquiring looks, \" surely it is as useless as unsatisfactory to inquire into motives. That I have earnestly and sincerely requested the continuance of your friend ship, is a sufficient attestation of the esteem with which you have in spired me.\""], [341, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 165 \"Enough !\" cried he, now really approaching to lake leave, and, wilh a hurried gesture, raising my hand to his lips, \u2014 \" I see you are willing to spare me unnecessary pain : you have been kinder lo me lhan I am to myself.\" And in another minute he had quilled Ihe room. Alas! what a revolution had been effected in my views and feelings by the preceding hour! The unjustifiable conduct held towards me by Hanton and Lord Penrhyn, may perhaps have tended lo reduce me to a becoming sense of humility ; but I certainly never expected my woman's pride to be reduced so low as lo induce the seeling of gratification with which the frank and honest offers of the Duke of Merioneth have penetrated my feelings. No man could throw himself more freely into a woman's power, without a single reservation in behalf of his own self-love; and aggravating indeed must be the self-conviclion, lhat not even the host of advantages combined in his alliance could avail lo turn the scale in his savour. A man so nobly endowed has a right to fancy lhat personal antipathy or previous engagement alone could determine his rejection. Fortunately for his peace of mind, the Duke of Me rioneth has accepted the latter alternative. That I have acted unwisely in renouncing such a marriage, I verily believe; but, of the cardinal virtues, prudence has ever held the lowest place in my estimation. The Duke is in the highest sense of the word a nobleman, a man of cultivated mind, of equal temper, of right principle, irreproachable throughout all the relations of life. Yet, though my existence as his wife would be secure not only from the storms, but even the shifting breezes of mortal destiny, a calm so hopelessly monotonous would torpify my faculties. I must have something to excite \u2014 something lo rouse me. I must look up, if not wilh fear and trembling, at least wilh deference and a strong sense of inferiority, to Ihe husband who is lo be obeyed and honoured as well as loved. I should assuredly degenerate inlo a mere automaton, a miserable creature of luxury and selfishness, were not my better qua lities stirred into activity by the companionship ofone far nobler-minded than myself. Enfin the thing is done ; and done, thank heaven, without refe rence to the intelligence afforded me by the duke, concerning one who has occupied too large a share in my consideration. It is pleasant to be diverted from one's own perplexities by agreeable tidings of the affairs of others. I have just received a letter from Lady Cecilia, in acknowledgment of an obligation, dictated by that fine, free, generous spirit of gratitude which accepts as frankly as it would bestow. During the sirst two years of my widowhood, I was able to lay aside, without penuriousness, a sum of nearly sive thousand pounds from my jointure, which I intended should accumulate for the"], [342, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 166 benefit os my little nephews; for, though Herbert was too proud to accept assistance in his own person, he could not have refused it in aid of Ihe education of his sons. The altered circumstances of the fa- mily have happily superseded all necessity for such a provision. On receiving Armine's letter, announcing Ihe death of Sir Robert, I ac- cordingly wrote to my solicitor, directing him to make over Ihe fund to my kinsman, Sir Jenison Delaval, in trust for his own son Clarence; and it seems lhat (he gift has so far stimulated the pride of \" Sare De lafals,\" that he offers to make a settlement of a thousand a-year on his son, if the Clackmannans will consent to give him Lady Alicia and exert their interest to obtain him an appointment; for nothing does he so much apprehend for Clarence as an idle life about town. At pre sent, no answer lo these proposals has been received from Clack mannan Court. But Lady Cis is sanguine ; and thanks me as the second providence of her son. If a few slight sacrifices of extrava- gance on my part should have proved the means of forwarding Ihe hap piness of these young people, I shall be richly rewarded. Spent the evening at Princess Zabuschka's, where the English do much congregate, and where I perceived thai the waves of society had closed as quickly over the head of Lady Sarah Andover, as those of (he ocean over some nameless wreck. Her fate, which for the two first days afforded a theme for universal commiseration, was slightly and slightingly alluded to. \" Poor thing \u2014 poor woman \u2014 sad example \u2014 frightfully worldly-minded \u2014 hurried off from Ihe stage where her foibles were exhibited to the last \u2014 unregretled by her family \u2014 ne glected by her servants \u2014 despised by her dependents,\" etc., etc., etc. And all (his of one who, but a week ago, was their hand-in-hand companion ; courted as an associate, consulted as an oracle of ihe temple of fashion or fo!!y I \"Pray when will the body arrive in England?\" inquired Lady Harriet Snipsnap, of Mr. de Rawdon. \"About the 17th; but the family burial place is in the north.\" \"The family burial-place!

I have heard of living in cotton, \u2014 bul I never heard of being buried in it. I daresay the family vault is in the new Liver pool cemetery. By Ihe way, who has gol Lady Sarah's parroquet?\" And such, doubtless, is the tone in which my own last moments will one day or other be discussed, falling, as I shall, like an aulumnal leaf, whirled from a fruitless bough lo wither on the regardless earth!

They lodge, eat, drink, live, die, and are buried in com munities. The dignity of Ihe lonely country house, of the solitary"], [343, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 167 mausoleum, is not for them. Had the cast-away of Juan Fernandez been a Frenchman, he would have hung himself to the first palm tree on the coast. Al Princess Zabuschka's, by Ihe way, I met our quondam London heiress, Madame di Campo Fiorito, who seems to have abdicated her glories in selling fool once more upon the Continent. It is far more difficult to faire evenement at Paris lhan in London ; not from press of rivalship, but from ihe secondary influence of what is called fashion. In the Almack's sphere, a beauty may reign an idol for a certain number of weeks. Her season must not be loo long, and should she rashly allempt a second, from the sublime of poetry she \"tumbles down to prose,\" and the world lakes a hitler revenge for ils former insalualion. Here, there is no definite local for a graven image to be set up. If idolized at court, the reigning beauty is a mark of scorn for the Faubourg St. Germain; if worshipped in the Faubourg, the salon of the Due d'Orleans votes her a quiz. Madamc'di Campo Fiorito passes in Paris for a pretly, pleasing woman; but no newspaper commemorates her triumphs, no petits soupers are given in her ho nour, no duels fought, no honeyed stanzas perpetrated. She must be surprised lo find herself deprived of her temporary importance, like a comet or a bird of Paradise stripped of its resplendent tail. Now lhal I am becoming habituated to the habits of French society, I cannot but figure to myself how much foreigners, females especially, must be struck by the familiarity and want of deference commonly ex hibited in England towards those of the opposite sex. The utmost intimacy scarcely privileges a Frenchman to take a lady's hand on entering a room, an obsequious bow forming the usual limit of his salutations ; nor would he dream of lolling on a sofa, or occupying an arm-chair, in a lady's drawing-room in the presence of strangers. At evening parlies men rarely obtain a seat; and their style ofaccosling ladies, even where the greatest familiarity exists in private, is distant and respectful. The courtesies of life are never sor a moment lost sight of; and gallantry exacts as much consideralion towards the least lovely and least distinguished woman, as fashion demands from a Crocksordite towards an Almack's patroness, or the young Marchioness of Abercorn. The London men of the present day have their own time and place for being civil ; but where is Ihe dandy who would entertain the least scruple al refusing to dance w ilh some Miss Brown, voted mauvais ton at Ihe club ; or al leaving an aunt from Russell Square to sind her way alone to her carriage, on a rainy night at the Opera ? The days of chi valry may be over; but Iheir legendary influence has proved more permanent on Ihe banks ofthe Seine lhan on those of the Thames. _We are now arrived at the close of the Carnival, and next week, mardigras closes at once the pleasures of the rabble and the fetes of the"], [344, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 168 beau monde.

Interrupted by a visit from Lady Evelyn Beresford, who has made her way lo Paris in a dormeuse, propped on air-cushions, to consult Hahnemann (the great father, as he is called, or more properly great grandfather, of Hom\u0153opathy) on the maladies of her disordered ima gination. \" I am quite amazed,\" murmured the sick lady, after a few intro ductory compliments to herself and me, \" to observe the barbarism still prevailing in France.

The Marchioness de Bretonvilliers look leave of me wilh more courtesy, but less kindness. I had not seen her since her formal diner de famileoi forty persons, in honour of the young Princess of Aspern's wedding, in which I was exclusively included. The chilling ceremo nies of Ihe signature of Ihe marriage contract, and Ihe overpowering dinner, impressed me unfavourably. Excuses are lo be made fora royal mariage de.convenance, but none for those of private life ; nor shall I ever forget my sensations of sympathy in the false position of lhat lovely girl Malvina do Rochemore, when I saw her settled by a notary, like a \" piece of meadow-land,\" or\" capital messuage,\" on a man wilh whom she had never been allowed lo hold ten minutes of confidential conversation. Madame de Bretonvilliers, by the way, complimented herself and me, on Ihe advantageous opinions I must have formed of French so ciety. Few English, she said, enjoyed the opportunities conceded lo myself of becoming acquainted wilh les interieurs of Ihe Faubourg St. Germain ; and it afforded her salissaction that my views of Paris had not been limited lo Ihe vulgar mobs of the court of Louis Philippe, or the bad company of the Chaussee d'Antin ! I have since had an unexpected insight inlo the paradise she represents as guarded by flaming swords against the approach of my country people. The Vauguyons, conscious of their want of hospitality towards a person by whose family their heir apparent was treated in England as I' enfant de la maison, insisted on giving me a farewell dinner; and, stately as I had found the hotel de Bretonvilliers, its for malities were far exceeded by those of the hotel de la Vauguyon.

The society assembled in these"], [349, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 173 anlique saloons was in good keeping with Ihe local. The men bowed rectangularly, as if accustomned to porter I'e'pee; while the ladies spread their brocaded skirls over the massive fauteuils, as if unhabi tualed to garments of lighter texture. Their tone ofconversation was as empty, but far less pompous, lhan that of the Bretonvilliers set, which is less securely sealed in ils honours ; and Ihere was a kindli ness and courtesy about the elder members of the Vauguyon family, which impressed me wilh a belter idea of le Ion-ton d'autrefois, lhan any thing I have seen in Paris. Captivating, indeed, must have been those graces of manner which could throw a veil over the stern armour of feudal arrogance, and conceal the soul corruptions of \" the reeling goddess with thezoneless waist,\" whose worship succeeded.

With a degree of coolness, which in England we should consider want of delicacy, Ihey informed me lhat Alfred had written from Spa, selling forth his attachment, and the advantages of Ihe match, his report of which having received due confirmation from their relation the ambassador in England, they in stantly sanctioned his proposals. \" But my grandson is neither a fat nor a fool,\" said Ihe Duchess, swallowing her live-aiid-lwenlielh tublette de jujubes. \"Soon after your arrival in Paris he perceived that his attentions were not accep table, and did ample justice to the honourable spirit in which you made him conscious of the fruillessness of proceeding to definite over tures. We should have been infinitely flattered, madam, to have re ceived Ihe cousin of our charming friend Lady Cecilia Delaval into ihe Vauguyon family; but, since it was not lo be, we heartily thank you for enabling our dear Alfred still lo pretend to the happiness of your friendship.\" I like the freedom from affectation of these people. Without seek ing oracles of wisdom under the painted ceilings of Ihe old hotel, I might perhaps have passed some pleasant hours in their society, had I not been apprehensive of encouraging the attentions of the little Count. There is something respectable in ihe mutual dependence of the family union of the Vauguyons ; Ihe well-understood subordination of three generations united under one roof. I doubt whether I could myself endure to live as part of such a community, a mere sharer of the general affection.

Nolhing could be more rich, more mas sive, than every Ihing scdecled by Herbert for his library and dining room.

Hai tslon Abbey, by the way, would produce a splendid effect, if refurnished by a judicious person in the style of la renaissance.

My mother would be much disappointed, were Mrs. Delaval, whom she so greatly admires, to pass through London without gratifying her by an interview.\" And it is accordingly settled lhat on Monday next we dine at Meri oneth House. \" So, Harriet!\" cried Herbert, the moment Ihe Duke had quitted the room, \" after all, the report lhat reached us from Paris was only one of the mysterious fabrications of that wonder-inongering fellow, Algernon Carringlon?\" \" What report?\" \" That you had refused the Duke of Merioneth, and a jointure of thirty thousand a year.\" \" A jointure of thirty thousand a year ! How could you suppose me so insensible !\" said I, Irving to laugh off his accusation. \" What woman of your acquaintance but would marry Blue Beard himself on such a temptation ?\" \" To say the truth, I acquitted you. But the thing was talked of one day at Ihe Club ; and afler Carringlon had been rolling his eyes, shaking his head, and looking as mysterious as a high priest of Bel and the Dragon, Harlston observed, that nolhing could be more probable; \u2014he knew the Duke to be a great admirer of Mrs. Delaval, but that it did not follow Mrs. Delaval should be a great admirer of Ihe Duke.

Lady Clackmannan evidently looks upon me as one ofthe facilitators of the mischief ; and Isabella Southam informed me yesterday, lhat whenever I am talked of, she expresses her opinion that \"Mrs. Delaval is a romantic, Highly young woman.\" I suppose she has taken care to communicate these notions lo her friend, Lord Harlston. In the midst of all these family disputes, poor Cecilia has got a learned Pundit from the Conlincnt upon her hands, who is, just now, terribly d charge. I found him silling wilh her yesterday, she looking like a tortoise in a menagerie, upon which some monster of a keeper has planted himself for the adrairalion of visitors \u2014 all shell, and not a glimpse of head discernible ! Her faculties seemed actually ecrase, benumbed, overpowered, by the weight of so prodigious a biped. \"People send one over these kind of creatures without the least consideration,\" said she, after his departure, \"and what on earth is one lo do with them?

The conversation-men like well enough to meet him once, in order to be wise or willy at his expense al the next half-dozen places they dine al ; but when his face comes to bo known at ministerial parlies, Kensington Palace, and Lans downe House, as 'the great Professor So-and-So, come to England lo write a book,' one might as well ask people lo come and meet a nourean delurquc from Grand Cairo, when the plague (the eighth plague) is raging in Egypt.\" ' ' Poor dear Cis I\" cried I ; \"and so you arc reallv under sentence"], [361, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 185 to let this Solon of the snows come and prose to you about prison disci pline and national debt !\" \"Exactly. At .first Ihe man talked lo me rationally enough of society, literature, and the aris ; but I saw he was pumping for his book, and so diverted the conversation to subjects on which I must infallibly talk nonsense, utterly useless to him.\" I recommended her to make the monster over at once lo old Lady Burlington, by persuading her that his skin is lallooed, or that he breakfasts upon snail broth ; after which he will obtain free quarters in the Duchess's collection of monstrosities. Wha I an affectation of lisllessness prevails among our London sine ladies; or is it, after all, reality \u2014 Ihe result of enervating habils? In Paris, people talk wilh eagerness ofan approaching ball \u2014 go al I he exact hour they are invited, intending to dance, and dance wilh satisfaction. They even say wilh frankness, \u2014 ''\u25a0Quel desespoir si Monsieur Hope ne m' invite pas d son premier lal!\" or \"Mon dieu.je descendrais me'me d des bassesses piur avoir une invitation de Monsieur DelmarA Here, on the contrary, they descant upon \"the bore\" of going to Al mack's or lo Lady Londonderry's, as if it were an act of penance, and make their appearance at twelve or one o'clock, saying, \"For Heaven's sake don't let us go too early ; we shall have quite enough of it.\" This, mark you, is \"affectation,\" and altogether dishonest. After all the toil and expense bestowed on a London season \u2014 the twenty balls a night \u2014 Ihe ten thousand people moving heaven and earth for invitations \u2014 are we lo believe lhat Ihe only individuals de riving enlerlainmenl from such vast efforts are only one or Iwo hundred awkward, blushing girls, the debutantes of the year? To the debutantes of lasl year, alas! Ihe epithet of \" blushing\" is rarely applicable! \u2014 Shocked as I was by the prosy courtship and marriage of Malilde de Rochemore, 1 am far more so by Ihe bold in dependence assumed by London young ladies\u2014 by the posiliveness of their opinions, Ihe knowingness of Iheir jargon, and the self-seeking impertinence of their demeanour in society. Before my lillle nieces are old enough lo be presented, 1 trust some happy medium will have been established, lo suspend the necessity for match-hunling on Ihe part ofthe naturally modest, timid girls of England. The first tinge of ill-humour I have seen on Herbert's counte nance since my 0rival, was on returning from his club yesterday, the day of the dinner at Merioneth House. He was vexed with Ihe Duke for having invited Lord Hartston lo meet us. Yet, surely, nolhing could be more natural lhan that he should collect at his table guesls previously acquainted. On entering the drawing-room, Lord H. was the sirst person I discerned, standing beside (he Duchess Dowa\"er, to whom I was hastening (o pay my compliments; and tho"], [362, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 186 flushed cheeks of which I was already conscious, arising from the embarrassment of finding niysils (he guest os the Duke aster what had passed between us, were doubly dyed by Ihe surprise of so unexpect ed a meeting. Du reste, the party was evidently made for me. The Delavals, Ihe Soufhams, Ihe Clackmannans, ihe Herberts\u2014 all my friends, were there. J nsi before dinner was announced, Lady Ceci lia, who saw me in full dress for ihe first time since my return, observ ed, in an audible vi ice, \"Harriet, my dear, do you know that you are grown very thin? Lord Hartston, do you not sind Mrs. Delaval looking very thin?\" And his half-whispered reply was far loo compli menlary forme to repeal, even in my journal ! \" Bravo !\" cried Lady Cecilia, with her usual heedlessness. \" aMy dear Harriet, it is is evidently your house of triumph. I have seen you receive here, at different periods, the homage of Iwo things unique after Iheir kind \u2014 a yellow union-rose, and a compliment from Lord Ilarlston.\" While she was talking in this rattling slrain, I saw Herbert biling his lips, and looking very cross ; but il was loo late \u2014 his friend's com pliment had been hollo paid and overheard. In Ihe course osdinner, Ihe Duke having inquired whether he should meel me at ihe ball al Devonshire House on Friday, I replied in the negative. \"At Lady AWesbury's, then, or Lady Cadogan's, or \u2014 \"You will meet me nowhere Ihis season,\" said I, interrupting his interrogatories; \u2014 \"lam in London for so short a lime, and tired myself so completely last year wilh a double season, that I shall pass my few weeks in town exclusively among my friends.\" \" I accept your presence here, then, as a double compliment,\" re plied he; \" and if you will repeal Ihe favour of your visit al Hazelhank (which you were so kind as lo admire last season), I will lake care lhat you still find yourself 'exclusively among your friends.'\" \" Yes, my dear Mrs. Delaval, you must really come lo Hazelhank,\" added Ihe Duchess. '\u2022'I have not been there yet this spring; and it will ensure me a pleasant day, if we can arrange a little party there under your auspices. In fact, I shall not visit Hazelhank, unless you promise lo meel me.\" In the evening we had a lillle music. Lndy Alicia Spoltiswoode sings Scottish ballads enchantingly ; and I fulfilled my part in the con cert by an air composed for Ruhini in Bellini's tmpuhlished opera, which I learned al Paris from himself. Il seems, however, thai in defiance of the determination I expresed to Ihe Duke, I am not lo remain altogether in Ihe shade. Al Sir Henry Herbert's earnest request, I accompanied Armine the other day to Ihe Drawing-Room ; and, in consequence of Lady Southam's presentation,"], [363, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 187 we have both received invitations for the ball at St. James's on Mon day next. I will not, a la mode des fashionables, affect lo regret this; and such a ball is of course an exception that need not be cited against me. .My preparations carried me ihis morning lo my old friend Mrs. Hemstitch, from whom I learned that my protege!, young Forster, has obtained a step in his office, and is doing honour lo me and himself; for which satisfaction, I am indebted lo Lord Hartston. Our dejeuner al Hazelhank was, if possible, more charming than I ha I of last year \u2014 more charming to me, because the Herberts were there for the first lime, and enchanted with the place. There were not above forty people present, including Prince and Princess Zabuschka, whom I requested ihe Duke lo invite, wilh Alfred de la Vauguyon as iheir cicerone. Lady Alicia was looking beautiful. She is greatly im proved this season ; and, now that her anxiety respecting her engage ments to Clarence is removed, is grown lively and conversible. As I was walking through the conservatories wilh ihe Herberts, admiring some exqusile botanical novelties, introduced since last summer, Lord Hartston, who accompanied us, picked a leaf or two from a geranium, and placed them in his button-hole. \" Is that geranium one of the scented kinds?\" said I, carelessly. \" I was not aware of it.\" \" Nor I,\" was his quiet answer. \" To me it serves to commemorate asouvenir. I was standing by lhat very plant, and leaning against that very pillar, last year, when you for the sirst time condescended to address me.\" Fortunately, neither Cecilia nor Sir Henry overheard the compli ment; the former would have been loo much amused, the laller too angry. Before the close of the day, I received a slill greater compli ment from a different person. The Duke of M. having contrived to lead me by degrees apart from Ihe rest of the parly, down a beautiful alle'e verte, beside an old wall, overgrown wilh honeysuckles, in quired, in a very faltering voice, whether lime and reflection might not have wrought some favourable change in my feelings towards him. \" I importune you on this subject,\" said he, \" for Ihe last lime ; but I would not willingly relinquish a pursuit so dear, and so warmly ap proved by all lo whom my happiness is a mailer of interest, wilhout one further effort in my own behalf. Be kind, dearest Mrs. Delaval ; be \"enerous. I cannot promise you happiness; I can only promise every care, to make you happy, which liie fondest affection and devo tion can suggest. Tell me, then, am I absolutely hopeless of softening your resolutions against me ? \" It was painful, if not difficult, to repeat my former answer ; and my noble-spirited admirer was really so diffuse and so unguarded in"], [364, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 188 the expression of his grief and disappointment, that I fear he was over heard by Herbert, who met us, with Lady Southam on his arm, at a turn of the shrubbery. The business, however, is now completely set at rest ; I have succeeded in satisfying the Duke that I know my own mind. This morning, according to an appointment made yesterday al Hazelbank, I accompanied Ihe Duchess of Merioneth lo the exhibi tions at Somerset House, and the Waler Colours; and, having re cently visited the exposition by modern artists, at the Louvre, was not a little gratified to observe the eminent superiority of my own countrymen. On entering every modern public gallery, whether in France or England, the eye is disagreeably struck by a number of glaring daubs, the production of young or talentless artists ; but a se cond glance brings lo view in Paris the graceful elegant portraits of Dubuse, a variety os infinitely clever tableaux de genre, and many meritorious specimens of sculpture \u2014 upon which art Ihe French government bestow liberal patronage ; while in England our steps are soon arresled by chef-d'\u0153uvres. The fine characteristic portraits of Phillips, Briggs, Pickersgill \u2014 the striking compositions ofWilkie, Les lie, McClise, and Cattermole \u2014 the exquisite works of Edwin Land seer \u2014 Ihe fine landscapes of Callcoll, Constable, Stansield, Daniell \u2014 the wonders of Mariin and Danby \u2014 Ihe busts of Chantry \u2014 the groups of Westmacott \u2014 are such as to render one proud of the slate of the fine arts of Great Britain, compared with all contemporary schools. But Ihe foregoing names are great and established, and a lover of Ihe arts will sind in almost every gallery in London delicious specimens of English landscape and composition, by artists comparatively un known, such as in other countries would be applauded lo the skies. Fortunately, the patronage of England lies wilh the public ; and these pictures are purchased by wealthy individuals, of names equally ob scure, and taste equally refined. I observed by the way, in Paris, that water-colour drawings, by well known English artists, command enormous prices, nay, twice as much as the sketches of Camille Roque plan, or Tcny Johannot ; for it is du bon-ton for a boudoir or fashion able album lo be graced by these charming exotics. What presump tion on the part of those who affect lo despise the exhibition at the Royal Academy, \u2014 a display which men of genius have laboured lo enrich with a hundred original efforts of fancy, or views of Ihe ever varying beauties of nalure! The Duchess made several purchases, which she presented to her son, for Hazelhank ; among others, some clever zoological epigrams, by Hancock, and a pair of beautiful landscapes, by Chambers and Wilson. There was a sketch by McClise, of which I longed to possess myself; hut alas ! 7 have neither house nor home in which to place it. My"], [365, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 189 tenancy in St. James's Place expires in a few months; aud then what will become of me and mine? Tuesday. \u2014 I am glad to have been present at Ihe Royal Ball; first as regards the dislinclion conferred on myself; and secondly, as regards the enjoyment of a pleasant evening. I was anxious, loo, for an oppor tunity of seeing Princess Victoria, concerning whose appearance I was so often interrogated on the Continent. Her Royal Highness is grown since I saw her at Ihe drawing-room last year; has avery pleasing countenance and manner, and bears a striking resemblance lo the portraits of the late Princesses Charlotte and Amelia. Had I not known her lo be Ihe heiress presumptive, I should have noticed her as a fair, elegant, Saxon (or ralher English) looking girl. The Queen's ball was far from so brilliant as lhat ofthe Tuileries, the apartments being neither so lofly nor so well lighted. But the whole thing bears closerexaminalion. The u/en have twice as much theairof gentlemen as Ihe French courtiers; and, if I may presume to decide upon my own sex, I should say that, although Frenchwomen are better dressed, the English are belter looking. The sons and daughters of Louis Philippe, all so handsome, and o,f so distinguished an appearance, impart, indeed, peculiar interest to ihe fetes at the Tuileries; but, in Ihis respect, the Court of England will soon acquire a new feature, and the suitors likely lo throng around our royal Portia, the object of such deep and national European interest, will lend a charm even to the gew-gaw palace al Pimlico. As I declined dancing, the Duke of Merioneth, who wished to en gage me. the moment I entered (he room, obtained the hand of Lady Alicia, and they had a place assigned them in the quadrille with the youn\" princess. I stood for some time wilh lady Southam and the Herberts, talking over the Rhine wilh Lord Hampton, who is just re turned from Italy. But the moment Lord Hartston could disengage himself from the royal parly, he came lo us, and scarcely left us throughout Ihe evening. He took me into the supper-room, which was much belter served lhan that at the Tuileries, though affording a less striking spectacle. Lady Southam has asked me to accompany her to-night to the Royal box al Drury Lane, to hear Malibran ; so I must hasten lo dine and dress. In London, everything must be dressed for. We had no one with us at the theatre but Lord Southam and a ralher pleasant Mr. Warburton, who is in some way or other attached to the Court. As Lord Hartston heard us make Ihe engagement, I thought il likely he might visit our box, not remembering that an im portant question was before the House, which rendered his absence impossible. Malibran, however, was sufficient; Malibran, whom I heard for ihe first lime, and could see and hear for ever. She is the"], [366, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 190 first operatic performer I have seen, who strikes me as a woman of genius. Grisi has talent, but Malibran infinitely more. Whether singing or acting, she engrossed my whole attention while on Ihe Stage,, and haunted my dreams all night. \u2014 -- \u2014 \u2014 j \u2014 - - tJ Thursday.\u2014 I have just had a visit from Cecilia, whom I had not seen since the breakfast at Hazelhank. She has never been invited lo the Queen's balls ; a circumstance lo which she avoids all allusion, but which I suspect is a source of great vexation, for she has a fit of ner vous illness whenever they lake place. \" Why did you not come and see me on Tuesday ?\" she inquired, in a peevish lone. \" I was tired after Ihe hall, and dined early, to go lo the play with the Soulhams.\" \" The play ! Who ever goes lo Ihe play, excepl school-boys during the holidays, lo see the pantomime ?\" \" I wenl lo hear Malibran, and enjoyed it as much as a schoolboy.\" \" Malibran ! \u2014 what on earth has Malibran lo do with the play?\" \" She is performing all her best parts al Drury Lane.\" \" How slrange ! 1 never hear anything lhat is going on ; no one ever lakes ihe trouble of telling me any thing. And why did you not come lo me yesterday ? \" \" I went v. ilh the Herberts into the cily, lo buy some old lapestry in St. Mary Axe. It was solar thai \u2014 \" \" You niighl as well have gone to Ihe moon at once. The truth is I was dying lor you lo go wilh me lo Almack's last night. If you had called, I should have persuaded you, and we would have gone to gether.\" \" I do not think you would have persuaded me. I have lost all taste for balls. What ohjucl have I in going? \" \" Nonsense ! You are crossed in love, or ambition, or vanity, and fancy yourself disposed lo turn hermit. You would have enjoyed Almack's exceedingly. Bul I hud an object ingoing. 1 hear the Duke of Merioneth is paying attention lo Alicia, and I wanted lo observe them together.\" \"They danced together at the Queen's ball,\" said I, not wishing to give her any insight inlo what had so recently passed between the Duke of Merioneth and myself; \"bul I did not observe any unusual atten tion on his part.\" \" And on hers?\" \"Nolhing! Lady Alicia was looking lovely, when noticed by the Queen and Princess Augusta ; acquitted herself with her usual graceful ease; and when Lady Mardynville came up, immediately afterwards, and pestered her wilh obsequiousness and civilities, nothing could be more high-bred than her manner.\""], [367, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 191 \"You were wilh Ihe old Duchessat the exhibition.

Dlua.. . \" I should not trust implicitly lo Ihe testimony of such a woman as Lady Mardynville.\" \" Certainly not; hut on the strength of her intelligence, I went straight lo L.dy Lancaster, who keeps a log-ljnpk of the movements of all unmarried Dukes; and from her I obtained lull consiinalion of the whole history.\" \" Singular enough.\" \" I know my sister. I saw a match would fulfil her ulmosl desires for her girl ; and will be the means of overthrowing all our projects for Clarence.\" \" Impossible ; the Clackmannans have given Iheir word.\" \" Conditionally \u2014 if Ihe young people continue in the same mind (ill Ihe end of Ihe year.

Alicia is but a mere child! What should she know of principle, or even of her own feelings? \" \"Slron\" arguments, surely, for breaking off her engagement wilh her cousin. Such a person as you describe, is most unfit to become a wife.\" \" Mi ! I see how it is, \u2014 you have joined the cabal against me! This will be the death of my poor boy ! It is all over with my poor boy ! \" And wilh same difficulty I recovered her from a fit of hysterical"], [368, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 192 tears, by persuading her lhat she has no immediate grounds for alarm. Now, however, that Cecilia has called the circumstances lo my mind, I remember pointing out, at the Queen's ball, the beauty of Lady Alicia lo the notice of ihe Duke. \" She is, indeed, a pretty little creature,\" was his reply. \"I fancy she pass.s a good deal of lime in your company.\" \" I have seen but little of her lately. Last season, we used to ride together daily ; our mutual connection wilh Lady Cecilia Delaval look me much into Lady Clackmannan's society.\" \" I thought so,\" answered the Duke. \" There is something in Lady Alicia's deportment which reminds me strongly of yourself. Il struck me last autumn, during your absence, when I was slaying at Clack mannan Court. Nothing is more catching lhan manner. I shall try to ascertain whether the resemblance holds good in other respecls.\" And immediately afterwards he engaged her to dance, which seems to have been Ihe beginning of iheir intimacy. I do nol suspect Lady Alicia of the slightest levity ; yet I should not much wonder if the unsuspecting naivete of her character were to lead her lo encourage attentions perceptible to all the world but her self, and likely, if unkindly reported, lo cause extreme pain lo her cousin. Were 1 to warn her on the subject, Lady Clackmannan might consider il an impertinent interference, and perhaps attribute my soli citude to envy or jealousy : nay, were I even to apprize the Duke of Alicia's engagement, even he might imagine me desirous of recalling his attentions lo myself. In short, I must leave the mailer lo ihe fates, and hope the best for Clarence. The lime approaches for quilling London ; and, although the sum merishness of the weather pleads strongly in savour of Staffordshire, I confess 1 am sorry to go. I enjoy London far more now lhat I am standing aloof from the vortex, than last season, when not a moment of my time was my own. I see all the people 1 like, I keep what en gagements! like; in short, 1 am thoroughly independent. No George Hantons or Lord Penrhyns approach me now sufficiently near lo en dow ihem wilh Ihe privilege of impertinence, and I begin to flatter myself I have made a few friends. Yesterday, lo my great surprise, old Lady Hartston called here, and expressed with so much real seel- ing her joy at the change in Herbert's fortunes and temper, and, con sequently, in the destinies of his excellent wife, lhat she quite won my heart. She did not mention her son till she was taking leave.\" \"I believe you sometimes see Eustace?\" said she, \u2014 \" How do you sind him looking? \u2014 Most people think him miserably altered since he came inlo office.\" \" 1 have been in company with Lord Harlston a few limes since my return to England,\" I replied, wilh as much indifference as I could"], [369, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 193 assume, \" and have known him so short a time, and so slightly, that I am no judge of his looks. His duties are very anxious ones ; I am not surprised that he should be harassed by their responsibility.\" \" Nor I,\" was the old lady's abrupt reply ; and, with another shake of the hand, she quitted the room. Is Lord Hartston looking ill, I wonder, that his mother should be thus uneasy; and am I in truth a careless observer of his appearance? Oh! lhat I dare sit calmly down, and interrogate my own feelings on the subject! But I have not courage. The question loo nearly in volves my happiness, and the result is loo wholly beyond my control. I certainly feel that, since my return to England, during the last fort night, Lord Hartston's manners towards me have become strangely softened ; and that his own demeanour now demonstrates the prefe rence which before I had only occasion to learn from Herbert's ebu lilions of temper. But what then ? His mind is too fastidious to admit of Ihe possibility of his attaching himself with the degree of infatuation which 1 should esteem attachment. Even supposing him to be actually in love as much as his nature will admit, it is not the sort of exclusive love lhat would satisfy my exigeance. Better dismiss him from my thoughts, and turn my steps, or my horses' heads, to wards Trentwood Park and rural philosophy. Mr. De Rawdon, the attache, who has just arrived from Paris, informed me this morning lhat at the desire of his cousin, Lady Maria, he transmitted to England, some weeks ago, by the bag, a huge MS., containing, \"Sketches of Italy with a patent Perryian, by Wilhelmina Clarinda Vinicombe, dedicated to her friend the Right Honourable Lady Maria de R ,\" and intended for immediate pub lication. What have I not lost ! Pray heaven the literary lady may not have taken it inlo her well-wigged head to commencer par le com mencement, and favour the public with an account of our niaiseries on the Rhine ! If people must write journals and diaries of their pro ceedings by sea and land, why not keep them to themselves as care fully as I do? Which of our islanders, unless, perhaps, Edward Bulwer, is privileged to treat of so sacred a subject as \" Italy and the Italians?\" for the same reason lhat his brother Henry had a right lo enlarge upon \" Paris and the Parisians;\" that, while studying tho character of all classes of society, he was warmly welcomed inlo the highest, and \" best can paint them, who has seen them most.\" Sunday.\u2014 -I went to the opera last night pour ecouter le ballet, (which, in defiance of all precedent, I confess that I prefer here to the mismatched acts and scenes they give under the same denomina tion at the Academie Royale), as well as to make my observations on the proceedings of the Clackmannan clique. I begin to fear Lady Cis's intelligence is correct. The Duke never quilted Iheir box ; and, 13"], [370, "DL1RY OF A DESENNUY&E. 194 though Lady C. pursued her usual policy of sending Lady Alicia home to bed before Ihe ballet was half over, because it was Saturday night, and the week has been a week of dissipation, I am convinced she is doing her utmost to favour the growing penchant of the Duke. I shall say nolhing on ihe subject lo Cecilia. If the daughter be really fickle, and the mother designing, Cecilia's utmost endeavours will not frustrate their plans ; and she will only get herself into trouble by the susceptibility of her temper. Lady Alicia's engagement to Clarence is not even suspected by the world ; and every one seems to notice the altentions paid her by Ihe Duke of M. The Carringtons stood near me last night, as I was wait ing, upon Sir Jervis Hall's arm, the announcement ofthe carriage. \" Pray did you observe the tremendous flirtation to-night between Lady Clackmannan's little nonentity of a daughter and the Duke of Merioneth ?\" said she, so loud as to be heard by half-a-dozen indiffe rent people. \" Jane \u2014 Jane !\" remonstrated her husband, \u2014 \" what right have you to make any such observation ? The Duke may seriously resent pre mature comments on his attentions. I beg you will be more conside rate.\" \"If people do not intend tobe talked about, why do they bore one wilh a public exhibition of their tender passions? Who wants to witness their wooings ? I would as soon sit looking a whole evening at a fond shepherd and shepherdess in Chelsea china, as bore myself with watching Ihe sweet smiles and soft glances of two noble ninnies in an opera-box.\" ' Jane \u2014 Jane \u2014 !\" \" More especially with such a hawk-eyed chaperon on the watch as Lady Clackmannan ; who, with all her philosophy and propriety, is as keen afler \u2014 \" \" Jane ! the carriage is called, \u2014 Jane, the carriage will drive off!\" interrupted Algernon Carringlon, dragging her offin dismay, though I am certain no carriage was announced.

Monday. \u2014 I accompanied the Herberts this morning to the musical festival, and was gratified even beyond my expectations. Sacred music is a branch of the art cultivated in England wilh unparalleled success. They may talk of the correctness of the choruses in Germany ; but a young English voice is so sweet and pure thai it is well worth more powerful organs. How truly do I enjoy the music of Handel when separated from the buzz-wigs and dowagerhood of the Ancient Con certs, which always seem to me to smell of Rishops ! \u2014 These popu lar musical festivals must greatly lend to the diffusion of musical taste."], [371, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 195 To-night, I have had my parting tea-drinking tete-a-tete with Cecilia, who is in miserable spirits ; and to-morrow, \" the glorious 1st of June,\" we take wing for Staffordshire. Heigho ! Trentwood Park, June 3rd. \u2014 This is truly what poor Lady Ce cilia would call \" a love of a place ;\" \u2014 so grassy-green, so lightsome, so pleasantly situated. As far as regards ray own taste, I might prefer the majestic gloom of Hartslon Abbey; but Trentwood is exactly as sorted to the social position ofthe Herberts. It gratifies me to perceive that Sir Henry has exclusively studied the comfort and convenience of my sister in his domestic arrangements ; and, with her four healthy, happy children around her in such a home, Armine would be very different from the amiable creature she is, could she experience an hour's discontent. The children were almost too happy in welcom ing us; and even aunt Harriet came in for her share of love and kisses. But is it not very soon, at six-and-wenty, to sink for life into \" aunt Harriet,\" without one nearer tie lo existence than the secondary af fections bestowed by those whose hearts are so warmly attached else where ? This removal to the country, in the midst of the stir and tumult of the season, has made me melancholy. The silence of Trentwood op presses me. The Herberts, indeed, have an interest here in which I cannot participate. This is their home, their happiness, their world. To me it is a beautiful spot, embellished by the presence of my sister and her family, but nothing more. My egotism demands something nearer and dearer to rest upon ; something wholly or almost my own. I have sometimes thoughts of taking Hollybridge, of which he has a long lease, off the hands of my brother-in-law. But Hollybridge is too near to Hartston Abbey ; and the world, or perhaps even my con science, might accuse me of a desire to approximate myself to the fa mily. Whenever I walk or drive with Herbert and Armine, their atten tion is so engrossed by projects or progresses of improvement, that I might as well be at Andernach. Sir Henry is making his wife a flower garden surrounding a charming conservatory ; and all I have to do is to play the umpire in their differences of taste. The park is exten sive watered by my own dear Trent, and skirted by beautiful woods. I sometimes wander out alone, book in hand, as an apology for com panionship, to enjoy the fresh verdure of the early summer ; and when is the country so beautiful as now, with its springing and slower enamelled grass, its cone-blossomed chestnut trees, the voice of the cuckoo in the woods, or the distant sound of coming rain promising to refreshen and re-invigorate all nature into slill brighter brightness? What is there in all this to depress my spirits ? yet I feel more lonely here amid the tranquil, graceful landscapes of Trentwood, than last 13*"], [372, "196 DIARY OF A DI.SENNUYEE. year, when ill and unhappy in a foreign country. I sear my restless spirit is wanlihg in \u2022' The wisdom fitted to the needs Of hearts at leisure.\" How difficult, in this world of equivocation, to speak truth even lo oneself! Were I to entrust my thoughts in all honesty to ray jour nal, I should acknowledge some disappointment that, notwithstanding the good understanding beginning to prevail between Herbert's friend and myself \u2014 notwithstanding the undisguised nature of his homage to me at Hazelhank, at Ihe Queen's ball, and elsewhere \u2014 he should have permitted me lo leave town for an indefinite period, wilhout a syllable in explanation of his sentiments. I ventured to inquire of Armine, in a careless manner, the other day, whelher Lord Hartston were likely to visit Trentwood in the course of the autumn ; but she told me frankly that Herbert had not even invited him ; that Lord H. had much to occupy his attention at the Abbey during his limited holidays ; that, when at leisure, he usually visited the Isle of Wight for yachting; lhat Trentwood was too far from town for his convenience ; \u2014 in short, that there was not the least idea of his coming. This is strange. I half suspect that Sir Henry is careful not to ex pose him lo the danger of my presence ! Truly he is a most valuable and considerate friend ! I know not why, but the summer season invariably renders me more triste al heart lhan the winter. In winter, when the winds howl and the stormy rainsdescend, the earth seems divided into countries, cli mates, provinces, homes, and every family becomes self-dependent. In summer, one soft and balmy atmosphere appears to enwrap the earth, and call forth its inhabitants to enjoyment. United into a single tribe, the world becomes too wide, when I remember that to its col lected multitudes / am nolhing \u2014 to none indispensable, and having no one indispensable to me ; and thus the summer redoubles my sense of loneliness. I hear the murmur ofthe insects in the air, the song of the birds in Ihe woods, the remote laughter of the children in the village, the whistle of the solitary herdsman in the fields, the far-away inter change of joyous voices\u2014 every thing is so joyous and joy-bestowing, that I turn lo my solitary heart, and am ready to weep for very weari ness of life. I have just received a letter from Cecilia, informing me that the Duke of Merioneth scarcely leaves Lady Clackmannan's house ; and lhat her husband, instead of sympathizing in her vexation, admits himself to be enchanted. \" Never,\" shesays, \" did I see Sir Jenison in such spirits. He fancies that an early marriage would have been the ruin of Clarence, who has"], [373, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 197 merely fallen in love with the pretty face lhat came first in his way, and is totally unfit for the cares of a settled life. On ihe other hand, lo re monstrate wilh Alicia is out of my power, for my sister takes care lhat I shall never see my niece alone, and lhat no letters shall reach her hands without previously passing through her own. That my poor boy should be sacrificed to such abominable perfidy, is really loo se vere a mortification.\" Clarence Delaval certainly appears to be unhandsomely used by the Clackmannans ; and all Ihis is the more vexatious because, having taken on myself to write to my good brother-in-law at Castle Delaval, in savour of the young man who must ultimately become his heir, William Delaval, with his usual gruff good sense and warm good seeling, replied to my application only yesterday, that he considered the objections of the two fathers cogent ones; but lhat if ihe young people showed any stability of mind by fulfilling the conditions exacted, he would do a kinsman's part in favour of his relative. I shall not acquaint poor dear Cecilia wilh the contents of Mr. Delaval's letter : his kindness would only serve lo aggravate her present vexation. Sir Henry is just now exclusively occupied wilh Ihe arrangement of his library, which is large and valuable; and it is amusing lo note the patience wilh which Armine stands beside him watching his opera tions, as referee of his doubts and confirmer-general of his opinions. After having once expressed my conviction that the old oak carvings ought not to be varnished, and that a Turkey carpet would be the best muffler of sound in a library, to both which opinions Herbert acted in direct contradiction, I withdrew my voice from the family council; nor is it possible for me to sympathise with wife-like delight in my brother-in-law's triumph, whenever he detecls among his mismatched treasures a Wynkyn de Worde or Caxton in good preservation. My value for books is in proportion to Ihe satisfaction I derive from their perusal \u2014 and so, I suspecl, is Armine's ; yet she contrives to interest herself in all Ihe pursuits of her husband, and sullies without hesitation her while dress and still whiter hands with sorting out odd volumes under his direction. In the same way, when they walk out together, she listens with unwearied ears to his dissertations on forest trees, or hisconsullalions wilh his bailiff respecting a great fall of timber which is to take place at Trentwood in the course of the autumn. This is the spontaneous result of her conjugal atlachment. She is not aware that she is making a sacrifice of her time and tastes to her husband ; and the nature of an affection such as Ihis I have yet lo learn. Even in the earliest moments of my marriage, when my girlish fancy endowed Colonel Delaval wilh a thousand supposititious merits, I certainly never felt inclined to pass my mornings with him in his stables, lo which the greater portion of his time was devoted ; and now what hope that I should ever learn to love so as to become thus unconsciously enslaved?"], [374, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 198 None ! it is too late\u2014 it is unhappily too late; for in such illusions exists the most hallow ed charter of human felicity. The Soulhams have arrived al their castle, which is only eight miles distant from Trentwood ; and the society of Isabella (who, though an excellent wife and mother, is by no means so exclusively absorbed in her family as dear Armine) will be a relief lo my feelings. I shall drive over to Southam Castle, and learn the latest news from London \u2014 not to-morrow, however, for, among the many kind actions per formed by Herbert on coming to his estate, was that of recalling from the neighbourhood of our old collage a veteran servant of my poor father, who had been pensioned off by my aunt in the adjoining vil lage ; and a charming cottage has been built for him adjoining some ancient almshouses \u2014 a foundation of the Herbert family within the very walls of the park. Sir Henry respected the pride of Corporal Worgan loo much to place him in one of these, and the old soldier bas been living at Ihe hall while the cheerful mansion was preparing, of which to-morrow he is to lake possession. We have all assisted to furnish the corporal's retreat ; and my little nephew, Montresor Herbert, is to present him w ith what will be the most valued of his new possessions \u2014 a copy of the picture of my father. Worgan's widowed daughter will keep house for him; and the veteran of Thoulouse, wilh his pipe in his moulh, and the effigy of his lamented general presiding over his fireside, will pass his remaining years in peace and content. All this was most kindly devised by Herbert as a gratification sor his wife. Trentxvood. \u2014 Just returned from a visit of a week to Southam Caslle. I was mistaken in my calculations respecting Isabella ; Lady Southam in London and Lady Southam in her own home are two very different beings. Her school-room, her manage, her village, her every thing that is hers and her husband's, occupy her whole care and atten tion. I saw that it was only by an effort of politeness, or rather kind ness, she could sufficiently abstract her attention to talk to me of books, pictures, men, and things unconnected wilh her family inte rests ; and this is so different a mode and mood from any which cir cumstances have ever made natural to my feelings, that to me it ap pears incomprehensible. Yet an intensity of family predilection may be, perhaps, essential to the good government of the world. But for this spirit of self-concentration, the homes of England would not, as they do, afford a model for the imitation of mankind. Lady Southam has not a moment unoccupied, a faculty unemployed ; while I, all idleness and listlessness \u2014 heigho ! let me cease lo dwell upon the subject. To-day the Southam Caslle party dine here, with two other neigh bouring families ; Ihe Dunbars with whom I was acquainted in Lon don, and a Mr. and Mrs. Toltemache, of Oakham Hill. No fear now"], [375, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 199 of a recurrence of that unlucky dinner scene in New Norfolk Street 1 Sir Henry's new establishment is admirably organized, and all goes smoothly as by clock-work. We shall have a pleasant party. Gracious heavens 1 what an unforeseen calamity ! How reduce my ideas to coherence, sufficiently to record it in these pages ! Let me by degrees recall my wandering thoughts, and dismiss these terrors that overpower me. The London post arrives at Trentwood between six and seven o'clock; so that I had scarcely time to glance over a long leiter from Lady Ce cilia, wilhout even opening the newspapers. Dinner was announced a few moments after I entered the drawing-room, before any general conversation had taken place ; but having assumed our places at table, Mr. Tollemache suddenly addressed Herbert wilh \" By Ihe way, Sir Henry, does your paper give any details relative lo this sad affair of Lord Hartston ?\" \" What affair ?\" inquired my brother-in-law, coolly continuing to help the fish, and attributing Ihe observation of his neighbour, who belongs to the Opposition, to some political question. \" W hat affair? Is it possible that you have not seen the \" Times?\" Is it possible lhat you have no letters from London?\" \" They were given me just as you arrived, and I did not give my self time to open them,\" replied my brolher-in-law ; \" has anything particular occurred?\" And in a whisper he directed the butler to bring from his own room a packet of letters. Mr. Tollemache seemed un willing lo reply, till Herbert earnestly repeated his question. \" One never likes to be the bearer of bad lidings. Lord Hartson is, I fear, your personal friend ?\" \" My dear Tollemache, for the love of God speak out,\" cried Lord Southam, compassionating the stale of Herbert's feelings. \" Hartslon is my friend as well as Sir Henry's : what has happened to him?\" \"lam grieved to say that Lord Hartston was assassinated on Tuesday evening as he was leaving the House of Commons.\" \" Assassinated,\u2014 dead? \"ejaculated Herbert, starling from his chair, and again sinking into it, incapable of uttering another syllable. \" No, not dead, dangerously wounded,\" replied Mr. Tollemache. \" The ball was not extracted when the paper went to press. You had belter read the account yourself,\" he continued, as the servant laid the letters and newspapers before his master. Herbert instantly rose from table and left the room wilh the letters in his hand. Not a word was spoken ; Armine sat pale as death ; and it is to be hoped that my coun tenance passed unexamined. \" I am truly sorry lhat I happened to mention the fact at so unlucky a moment,\" said stupid Mr. Tollemache, regretting only that (he pro gress of dinner was interrupted ; till at last Lord Southam, tired of his"], [376, "DIARY OF A DE\u00abENNUYEE. 200 unmeaning apologies, asked permission of my sister to follow her hus band for further information. How horrible was the suspense that followed ! I scarcely know what passed. Observations were addressed to me which I could not answer; questions were asked which I could understand. I sat with my eyes fixed upon the door, while the mechanical business of the dinner proceeded around me. At length, just as I felt conscious of my incapability to endure the suspense of another second, and was on the point of rushing out of the room in search of my brother-in-law, Lord Southam returned and took his place. \" Go to your husband ; your friends I am sure will excuse you,\" I heard him whisper to Armine, as he resumed his seat; and while she hastened lo obey, he briefly, and in a depressed voice, informed us that Herbert was about to set off for London ; lhat Lord Hartston, whose case, though one of imminent danger, was not desperate, had expressed a wish to see his friend. \" But what can possibly have been the cause for attacking a man so worthy and so popular?\" inquired Lady Soulham. \" What can have been the motive ofthe assassin ?\" \" As far as the examination at present tends to explain, mere mental delusion,\" replied her husband. \" The delinquent is a middle-aged man, who states himself to have been aggrieved by Government. He arrived lately in England from one of the West-India colonies, de manded an audience in some irregular way of the Secretary of Stale; was refused; and having made his way into Ihe lobby of the House, resolved to wreak his vengeance upon one of Ihe Ministers : it seems to have been a matter of indifference to him which, \u2014 the mau is evidently in a stale of derangement.\" \" How grievously unfortunate lhat the wretch should have chanced to fall in with our friend!\" ejaculated Isabella; a sentiment thai was loudly echoed by all present. \" When did the event occur?\" was the first inquiry I sound courage to make. \"Two nights ago. Herbert's letters were written after Astley Cooper and Brodie had examined the wound, and given a more fa vourable opinion than the first aspect of things seemed to promise.\" \"How long will it take for Herbert to reach London?\" was my next question. \" Fourteen hours, using the utmost dispatch. Post horses are sent for, but cannot be here under an hour.\" Will my sister accompany Sir Henry ?\" \" He does not wish Lady Herbert to encounter so unnecessary a fa tigue.\" In sine, Herbert quitted Trentwood iu his britshkaand sour at half-"], [377, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 201 past eight last evening, and Armine, though all anxiety to accompany him on his painful errand, acceded to his request. Thank heaven, our guests are gone ! Thank heaven, I am now at liberty to combat alone, and unobserved, the horrible presen timents lhat overwhelm me ! He will die \u2014 I know that he will die 1 \u2014 So young, so honoured, in the zenith of his career; \u2014 poor, poor Lady Hartston ! \"It is not until the day after to-morrow we can receive tidings from Herbert, and to-day's papers will bring only a recapitulation of the intelligence contained in the letters which summoned him lo townj Alas! they may contain later intelligence. They may contain tidings ofthe fatal termination of Lord Hartston's sufferings. I have no patience with Armine. I am obliged to lock myself into my own room, lhat I may not be harassed with her lamentations over the necessity of Herbert's absence, and her apprehensions lhat he will suffer from fatigue or take cold. That she should assign impor tance to such trivialities at such a time ! \" The post is come in. More letters for Herbert with the London post-mark, and I cannot persuade Armine to open Ihem. The news papers contain the second examination of the assassin Barnard, prov ing him beyond all question to be a lunatic ; and a somewhat less fa vourable report of our friend. The bulletin states him lo have passed a feverish, restless night. The letters, no doubt, are more explicit. Will this day ever be over ! At last I see the groom crossing the bridge with the letter-bag, and as leisurely as on any ordinary occa sion. He has reached the hall \u2014 What selfishness on the part of Herbert\u2014 not a line ! Armine per sists in supposing him to be ill,\u2014 him to whom the very word indis position is unknown ! The papers continue to give unfavourable ac counts. Would lo heaven I dared persuade Armine to order the car riage, and drive over to Soulham Castle.

In spite of all my philosophy, all my attempts at self-conlroul, how incessantly during the last three days have I recurred again and again, to every trivial particular of my acquaintance wilh this man \u2014 Ihis man, whose fate so many reverential friends, whose sale Ihe whole metro polis, the whole nation, unite to deplore! Had it not been for my own vain levity, I might perhaps have been his wife. But would that have preserved him from his direful destiny? \u2014 would it have restored him to his friends and to his country ? \u2014 Alas ! no. It would but have endowed me wilh Ihe valued privilege of soothing his last moments, of consecrating myself to his memory, and, perhaps, of having embellished with my devoted affection the sow latest months of his existence. He once perilled his life for my sake \u2014 what, what would I not have done for ils preservation. At last, a letter from Herbert, but containing only a few incoherent lines, and of an unfavourable tendency. That I had but an excuse for selling off for London ! I have devised a method for obtaining the earliest and surest intel ligence. Young George Forster, who is in his office, will see nolhing ob jectionable in my solicitude for tidings of his benefactor ; and I hive accordingly requested him lo write lo me by every post, till Lord Hart ston is out of danger; \u2014 till'- when he is perhaps already no more. Addresses of condolence have been voted both by Parliament and the City of London, in token of respect to the sufferer; and the assassin Barnard is strongly guarded when brought up for examination, or the populace would tear him to pieces. But what consolation is there in all this? I am so weak \u2014 so feverish \u2014 that I have scarcely strength to open tellers or papers. Armine's anxiety during Herbert's absence luckily prevents her from extending much notice to me, or she would be tormenting me to take advice. How will all this end? I am sick at heart ! My self-command is altogether exhausted ! Five weeks have elapsed. In how different a spirit do I take rny pen from lhat which compelled me to close my Diary 1 How happy I am to-day, yet with scarcely strength lo indulge in my feelings of happiness. He is safe, \u2014 he is comparatively well, \u2014 he is coming here for change of air. Would lhat I could devise some pretext tor quitting Trentwood previously to his arrival, for my consciousness will cer tainly betray me. Herbert is, after all, the best creature in the world. On this occasion he has quite lost sight of himself; he has never for a moment quitted his friend. Englishmen alone are capable of these strong brotherly attachments. Lady Hartston was of course anxious that her son should remove at once to the Abbey. The medical attendants, however, would not hear"], [379, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 203 of Such an arrangement, and decided lhat the invalid must go where he would be secure from personal cares and personal excitement. They, stupid people, proposed Brighton,\u2014 hot, noisy Brighton! But Herbert was luckily at hand; and when he suggested Trentwood, and offered to accompany him thither by easy stages. Lord Hartston con fessed himself delighted with the plan. They are to be here on Monday, and Armine has prepared a quiet cool suite of rooms on Ihe ground floor, opening to a charming breakfast room hung wilh green, the very thing for an invalid. There is a clump of beech trees on the lawn within a hundred paces from his windows, under which Lord Hartston will be able to take the air during this hot weather. The Herberts have even persuaded the old lady to come and rejoin her son in Staffordshire, after a business fortnight at the Abbey. I shall contrive to get away before her arrival ; I really cannot overcome my awe of Lady Hartston. The tone of Lady Cecilia's letters almost puzzles me. She states that Lady Alicia's marriage with the Duke of Merioneth is all but de clared \u2014 that he dines daily with the Clackmannans \u2014 lhat they are con stantly at Hazelhank, where she is no longer invited. But, instead of indulging in her former invectives, Cecilia relates all this without a word of comment! Nay, stranger still, in alluding to the horrible attempt upon the life of Lord Hartston, and the contemplated change of Ministry, coolly observes, \" had this change indeed taken place, it might have been a good thing for Clarence ! Had Sir Jenison's party come into power, a brilliant career would be opened for my son :\" as if she had made up her mind to see him quietly resign Alicia, and betake himself to an official life. These excitable people are strangely incon sistent. It is impossible to calculate upon the effects which great events will produce upon their feelings. They are susceptible onlyabout trifles. In addition to these tidings, Lady Cis has savoured me with a piece of London news, which shocks more than it surprises me. About a month ago, when I was too deeply engrossed to notice the allusions of the newspapers, Mrs. Percy, it seems, eloped not with but to Lord Penrhyn, who makes no secret of his dissatisfaction at the event. Mrs. Percy is, however, too highly connected for her honour to be trifled with; and, as his former devotion was a matter of notoriety, he must pay the forfeiture of his folly. Mr. Percy has commenced proceedings against Lord P. ; and, being one of those slupid animals who do ag little evil as good, there can be no pretext for recrimination. Blind as he was in courting Penrhyn to his house, no one supposes his blindness to have been wilful ; it was simply that of imbecility ; in compensation of which qualification, he claims the sum of ten thousand pounds. Lord Penrhyn, meanwhile, must unite himself to a silly, ill-tempered, ill conducted woman, of whose society he has long been weary. \u25a0How idle it is to expect anything like rational sympathy from"], [380, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 204 those beneath us! During our recent affliction, the servants in the house were loud in their lamentations, not over the public calamity thai had occurred, but over the necessity for poor Sir Henry's absence, just as his house was beginning to be comfortable. This morning, too, I visited old Worgan's cottage; and, in reply to his inquiries after his benefactor, tried to make him sensible of Ihe cause of his absence. \"Yes, \u2014 he knew that a great parliament-man had been shot, and if it had been a score instead of one, the country, may-be, might have been none the worse. What call for setting up an outcry over one of them speechifying chaps, just as if fifteen or twenty thousand brave fellows were lying stiff and stark on a field of battle?\" \" Lord Hartslon,\" I said, \" was one of the King's ministers.\" \"Never heard tell that the nation was any Ihe belter for him! Don't see much use in King's ministers, except to make taxes and fleece the poor. Wasn't there plenty of people in Lunnun to take care of sick and wounded, without drawing Sir Henry Herbert (God bless him !) out of his comfortable home and away from his family? Be bound, one ofthe King's ministers, or the whole pack of 'em toge ther, ben't worth the weight of Sir Henry Herbert's lillle finger.\" I shall send Armine to visit the old Corporal. / have no patience with the narrowness of his notions ; while she will doubtless reverence his discernment ! Sunday. \u2014 During the last week the weather has been sultry. This evening, however, we have had a tremendous thunderstorm, which has cleared the air, and rendered the atmosphere fresh and delicious. To-night the travellers sleep within thirty miles of us ; to-morrow they will be at Trentwood. I dread, yet long for their arrival ! Monday. \u2014 They are here \u2014 safe.

He walked slowly up to me, took me by both hands, looked earnestly inlo my face, and sat down wilhout a syllable ; while I was too much overpowered by his mode of greeting, to utter one word of welcome. Lord Hartslon is miserably altered; severely, indeed, must he have suffered to be thus reduced. Yet the physicians assure Herbert lhat there is no further cause for alarm ; that his constitution has received no material injury from the shock ; that, wilh care and quiet, a few months will suffice to restore him. He ought certainly to resign office. Herbert and his other friends ought strenuously to advise him to resign office. But most unfortunately, his Majesty, who visited him in person previously to his leaving town, made il an earnest re quest that he would neither occupy himself wilh public business till"], [381, "DtARY OF A DESENMYEE. 205 the meeting of parliament; nor decide, till then, upon his suture plans. The King, they say, was much affected by the interview. He paid also a visit of congratulation to Lady Hartston. Tuesday. \u2014 Isabella and Lord Southam Jiave been here; but judi ciously and kindly abstained from seeing the invalid : they came only as a mark of respect. While Herbert was relating lo Lord S. the sufferings undergone by their friend during the extraction of the ball, and describing (he mildness and patience of Lord Hartslon through out his illness, I saw Ihe tears standing in their eyes. Howl love this weakness on the part of two men of such manly natures ! I am not surprised that Armine and Isabella are so strongly attached lo their husbands. Wednesday . \u2014 I have been trying to persuade the Herberts lhat I ought to join Lady Cecilia at Wardencliff, at a lime she is experi encing so much vexation ; but they will not hear of it. Sir Henry protests it would be most unkind of me to quit my sister now his whole attention is engrossed by his friend. There is no possibility of escape. August 29th. \u2014 The mornings are now too hot lo admit of riding, driving, or even sauntering in the shrubberies. Yet Sir Henry con tinues to busy himself wilh his woods and farm ; while Armine, who has just got a German governess for the lillle boys, passes her whole time in the school-room, to ascertain the merits of her system. They treat me wilh very little ceremony ; sor the task of entertaining the invalid has by these means been left almost entirely upon my hands. My sister invariably addresses me after breakfast, in Lord Hartston's presence, wilh \" I must trust to you, dear Harriet, not to leave our friend alone. Just now I am so arduously occupied with Mrs. Arnslein, lhat it is out of my power to read lo him or be his amanu ensis. You, who are an idle woman, will kindly supply my place. Bring your work here, or the volume of De Jocqueville you began yes terday ; and do not let Lord Hartston tire himself wilh talking.\" And thus I am peremptorily installed companion to Herbert's friend ! They ought not to have invited him to Trentwood, unless they intended to pay him more attention. There is some compensation, however, in perceiving how rapidly Lord Hartslon is regaining his strength and spirits. He is beginning to enjoy himself as much as any of us. Yesterday afternoon, being cloudy and cool, we drove over in the open carriage to Southam Cas tle ; and the preceding evening, while Sir Henry and my sister were riding together, we look a long stroll, accompanied by little Monlresor, in the park. I ought not, however, to be made Ihus responsible for the proceedings of the invalid ; for, should he suffer from these exer tions, / only shall be blamed. I can no longer understand how I ever came to fancy myself in aw\u00ab"], [382, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 206 os this man. Never did I meet with a disposition so mild, so indulgent, so prone to favourable interpretation of the motives of others, or so diffident of his own. He could not be more sensible to the testimonials of interest recently bestowed on him by the nation, had his life been as useless and his position as obscure as that of a Sir Jenison Delaval or a Sir Robert Mardynville. All lhat he is, all that he has done, passes for less than nothing in his estimation. Heaven spare his life to realise the noble and patriotic projects slill brightening his views for the pub lic welfare! Lady Hartston arrives in a day or two, and will re lease me from my attendance. On the whole, I could dispense wilh her presence, for though I shall rejoice at recovering the commandos my time, I cannot help searing lhat the old lady will impose a restraint upon our family circle. At present we are very merry. Sir Henry and his wife are, and have reason to be, in Ihe highest spirits; and I am positively surprised at the gaiete de c\u0153ur which, forming a most un suspected part of Lord H.'s character, exhibits itself now that he is re leased from the cares of office. This morning, we have been laugh ing heartily together over the presentation copy of Miss Wilhelmina Vinicombe's \"Sketches in prose and worse.\" The way in wdiich she has amplified our adventures between Calais and Coblentz, by the aid of her numberless epithets and the flights of her imagination, is perfectly astonishing. The scene at Laach (literally as prosaic as a German supper and beds could make it) figures between sonnet and sonnet in her pages, in a style to do honour to the Caslle of Otranto or Anne Radcliffe's romances. Lord Hartston says she belongs to the arabesque school \u2014 all flourish about nothing. Luckily enough the florid style in which she describes me and my proceedings will never lead the world to suspect poor insignificant Mrs. Delaval in \" that lovely and accomplished friend whom I accompanied from the brilliant haunts of the fashionable world to Ihe more picturesque districts of the Continent.\" 1 know not whether it was in associating wilh such people as the Farringtons and his other Bedfordshire worthies, but, by some means or other, Sir Henry Herbert has contracted an odious habit of persi/lage, or rather of vulgar quizzing, lo me, perfectly insupportable. For the last week I have noticed myself to be the object of significant looks and insinuations on his part, far from well-bred, and as far from agreeable. Yesterday I ventured a serious remonslrance on the subject with my sister, and from something I extracted from her, strongly suspect, and greatly fear, thai my unguarded correspondence with George Forster is no secret in the family. Not from wilful indiscre tion on the part of the young man, but in his zeal to ensure the safe arrival ofthe letters to which I seemed lo allach so much importance, he caused them to be franked by the chef de bureau of Lord Hart stou's office; and on one occasion, when Herbert was in conversation"], [383, "DIARY OF A D__SENNUYtiE. 207 with this gentleman, who is his intimate acquaintance, a letter addressed to Trenlwood lying on the desk attracted my brother-in-law's notice, and drew forth the history of Forster's daily despatches. The young man might certainly be supposed to have maintained a correspondence with me on business ossome other nature; but Herbert's smiles convince me he has guessed the truth, and I have been obliged frankly to explain to my sister that any further reference to the subject will drive me away from Trentwood. I thought my brother-in-law had more tact. Lady Hartslon arrived to-day in time for dinner, and I was absolutely startled by the change in her manners and appearance. The old lady is in such high spirits, that it seems as if her son's danger and recovery had rendered her, for the first time, sensible of his value, She embraced Armine, and afterwards, to my surprise, included me in the same ceremony; she has laid aside her mourning, and makes her appearance at Trentwood attired like the rest of the world. She is much gratified by the change which country air has wrought in Lord Hartston's appearance, and finds him looking far belter lhan she expected. This evening, while she was taking coffee with my sister before the arrival of the gentlemen, I walked across the lawn to the conservatory to admire anight-blowing Cereus, and, on returning, rather sooner perhaps than they expected, overheard the old Lady observe to Ar mine \u2014 \"In my opinion they are more deliberate than there is any oc casion for. I stayed a week longer than I wished at Ihe Abbey, pur posely lo give Eustace time to settle it all before my arrival. When two people of their time of life are seriously and mutually attached, why not own it at once, and be happy?\" This must have been said in allusion to Lord Hartston and myself. I shall quit Trentwood wilhout further delay. \u2014 \u2014From breakfast-lime, contrary to my usual custom, I passed this morning in my own room, on pretence of letters to write. There can be no further occasion sor me to devote my time to a person who has now his own family on the spot ; and the Herberts have scarcely acted fairly in placing me hitherto in a position liable, I sind, to such unkind interpretation; but, profoundly as they are occupied with each other, my sister and brother-in-law have no consideration for the feelings of any olher human being. Interrupted by Lady Hartston, who, Heaven knows why, chose to pay me a visit in my dressing-room, though sure of meeting me pre sently at dinner. She came, I fancy, to enlarge upon her obligations for the kindness I have shown her son during his convalescence, and with a degree of warmth I had scarcely expected from her. I replied as coldly as I could, and in the course of conversation gave her to un derstand lhat, next week, I should he at Wardencliffe with IheDelavals,"], [384, "DIARY OK A DESENNUYEE. 208 She appeared surprised and vexed, sor her own visit to Trentwood will probably be of much longer duration.

For more than a year did his belter judgment resist Ihe passion which, from the first moment of our meeting, attached him to Ihe giddy Harriet; but now, approval and preference go together.

At present, I have made no confessions in return ; but discerning as he is, may he not have guessed the truth \u2014 lhat my heart has been long and wholly his? ..I IV. _.\u25a0\u2022\u00ab\u25a0 \u25a0 \u201e_.-_\u2014 _-_-. J ._.-_-_- - lj J Dear Lady Hartston was, after all, the means of promoting a perfect understanding between us. How fortunate that she made up her mind to come to Trentwood! We might have spent the whole autumn to gether in doubts and misgivings, but for her active interposition. She, too, declares herself lo be the happiest of mothers, her utmost desires being fulfilled. The Herberts are enchanted; my kind friend Isabella perfectly approves; \u2014 I seem lo have engaged myself to the man of my choice, only to impart pleasure lo my friends. Lady Hartston insists lhat the marriage shall take place next month, in order that our arrangements may not be broken in upon by the meeting of Parliament. She fancies herself in a great hurry to become a dowager, and settle in Northamptonshire ; and will probably succeed in having her own way, for all the world is on her side. 1 have so many letters lo write, so many orders to give, so much to listen to from Eustace, so much to reply, lhat I scarcely find a moment's leisure for my journal. Another fortnight, and I relinquish the liberty which, only two years ago, 1 fancied so enviable a posses sion. The Herberts have obtained our promise that the marriage shall be solemnized at Trentwood. Lord Hartslon owed it to the devoted attachment of his friend, lo accede to Sir Henry's request. There is, in fact no object in a visil lo town for such a purpose. Here, in this dear, quiet, venerable village church, the vows from which I am to derive the happiness of my suture life, will be pronounced, without pomp, show, or interruption. The lime is drawing awfully near ! \u2014 Wednesday in next"], [385, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 209 week is assigned as the solemn day. I have already received from the benefactress of the Forsters, a handsome trousseau ordered for me by Cecilia ; and Hartston's new travelling carriage arrived last night. We have both outlived the age of caring for such Irifles ; but the cere monies of society must be respected. Both Lady Hartslon and her son have been honoured wilh highly flattering letters from the King. Every distinction that merit can com mand, do they receive on all sides. Am I not too fortunate in con necting myself with those whose excellence is so universally acknow ledged? I have just received from the Duke of Merioneth, who is of course still ignorant of the revolution in my own destinies, the kindest letter, announcing his approaching marriage with Lady Alicia Spottiswoode, and expressing Iheir mutual desire and hope to number me among the most intimate of their friends. Alicia does not, however, add a post script to this flattering epistle ; I fancy she would feel a little embar rassed toaddressme on such a subject, after her breach of faith towards poor Clarence. Herbert, who was privy to my cousin's engagement, is scandalized by Ihe whole proceeding. \" But what could this Duke expect better,\" he says, \" in marrying Ihe daughter of so worldly a woman as Lady Clackmannan, a girl educated without principles save those of convention and etiquette!'' It is vain for me to assure him lhat Alicia is gentle-tempered and simple-hearted. \" Commend me,\" is his reply, \" to Ihe simplicity which has induced her to jilt the lover of her youth for a Duke with Ihe revenue of a prince !\" By the way, I have discovered that there exists a personage at Trent wood almost as ill to please with my own marriage. Old Worgan is greatly dissatisfied that \"Miss Harryet, that had the sense when a slip ofa girl to give her hand to a brave sojer, should think of demeaning herself by a second match with a lord that has never seed a day's ser vice, nor smelt powder except in a charge on the pheasants and par tridges.\" I must pay him a visit of conciliation, or I shall be quite out of the poor old man's good graces. How kindly thought of on the part of my brother and sister! Wilhout saying a word to me on the subject, they engaged the Dela vals to be present at my wedding. Sir Henry even invited my good brother-in-law from the Castle ; but William, who is suffering from one of his periodical attacks of gout, has satisfied himself with sending, in his slead, a magnificent set of opals, which Lady Cecilia was com missioned to procure for him in town, as a token of brotherly esteem. Most unexpectedly to me, the Delavals arrived this evening ; Cecilia radiant with joy and kindness. She assures me, that nolhing but my marriage \u2014 a marriage which has her unqualified approval \u2014 would have induced her to quit Wardencliffe jusl now. \"I suppose, nfy dear Harriet, you have seen in the papers an l?"], [386, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 210 account of the splendid rejoicing at Clackmannan Court!\" said she, after exhausting her inquiries relative lo my own affairs, as we sat together in her dressing-rooom, before dinner. \"They appear to have been truly magnificent, worthy in every respect a marriage so distinguished.\" \" My sister was indelicate enough to invite us to join the family parly: as if I were likely to be gratified by the sight of their beacon fires and triumphal arches !\" \" The Marchioness thought right to pay you a compliment, which she doubtless knew you would decline.\" \" As if I had not derived sufficient mortification during the last ten days before I left London, from witnessing the preparations for Lady Alicia Spoltiswoode's trousseau ; jewellers, mantua-makers, milliners, lingeres, whichever way one turned, nothing was to be heard of but (he wedding-clolhes of the Duchess of Merioneth. One would sup pose no one had ever been married before !\" \" Few persons at once so distinguished, and forming so distinguished an alliance. A marriage between a beauty and an heiress and the richest Duke (with Ihe exception of the Duke of Devonshire) in the kingdom, was enough to excuse some extraordinary display.\" \"Ah 1 it is all very well. I only hope (hey may be happy !\" \" Have you heard lately from Clarence?\" I ventured to inquire, half afraid of wounding her feelings. \" Oh ! dont talk to me of Clarence ; I have no patience to hear Ihe name of Clarence.\" \" I trust he has borne his disappointment with fortilude, or, perhaps, I should say with spirit.\" \"Fortitude? \u2014 Spirit? \u2014 I \u2014 all hisown doing, allhisown fault. You have been so occupied lately with your own affairs, that I suspeel you have heard nothing about my son.\" \" Not a syllable.\" \"Well, well, you will find plenty of good-natured friends of ours to tell you the story, so perhaps I had -bettor relate it at once. I recol lect old Lady Burlington, and two or three others equally well versed in the perversity of human nature, saying, when they heard of my sister's and Sir Jenison 's objections to a match between Clarence and Alicia, ' Why don't the families sanction an engagement between the young people, and they will Ihemselves be the sirst to break il?'\u2014 and so it has proved.\" \" Do you mean that Clarence has followed Lady Alicia's example of fickleness ?\" \" My dear child, he was the sirst lo lead the way. You may have heard how dissipated are Ihe habits of Vienna? Scarcely had Clarence arrived there, when he formed an attachment\u2014 a liaison\u2014 a (what shall I decently call it?) with some odious German countess, one of"], [387, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 211 those mischievous coquettes of a certain age, always on the watch to enlangle boys like Clarence, idle and fashionable, like all the young attaches of all ihe Courts in Europe.\" '.'. And the Clackmannans heard of this connexion, perhaps, even sooner than yourself?\" \" Of course Ihey did. They had spies upon the watch lo acquaint them wilh every little fault and folly committed by my son, in order to poison Alicia's mind against him by the recital. This act of infide lity I admit, however, to have been a serious error ; for the foolish people thought fit to commit themselves so publicly, that the lady was requested by the Empress to withdraw from court ; while Clarence has been despatched by the ambassador to Toeplitz, lo be out of the way \u2014 a measure which I lake most unkindly of Sir Frederick, for the woman is a Lutheran, has been divorced once, and will think nothing of going through Ihe ceremony again ; and, if she should rejoin Clarence in Prussia, what will become of us ? Already I have ma naged to get my son recalled, and we are trying to have him appointed lo the mission at Washington.\" \" Poor Clarence !\" \" Oh ! pray do not waste your pity on one so ungrateful for all that has been done for him ! \u2014 But it is my sister Clackmannan's faull ! Had she allowed them to marry at once \u2014 \" \" Her daughter would never have become Duchess of Merioneth.\" \"No, indeed; she has her reward. Her man\u0153uvres have, as usual, succeeded. Well ! Alicia js a darling girl, and will do credit lo her new honours. Clarence did not deserve her. I admit, that she was too good for Clarence, faithless and unprincipled as he has proved. It will serve him right, if he finds himself obliged to marry Countess Staro wicz. But let us talk no more of him. I am come to Trentwood to be happy, and to think only of you.\" In the course of Ihe evening, however, she not only resumed the subject, but actually kept me gossiping in a corner apart from the rest of Ihe parly, describing the beauty and accomplishments of the Coun tess Starowicz, and telling me lhat our friend Szchazoklwonski, who is the lady's cousin, declares her to be the most fascinating woman in Europe. In short, poor Cecilia is beginning to be almost as much in love wilh her son's unknown idol as she used to be with Lady Alicia. If Clarence should continue his career at the rate he has commenced, my poor friend will have worn her heart to tatters, before he attains the age of thirty. No doubt we shall soon hear of him at the feet ol some belle ot the Broad-way. I inquired of Cecilia whether Sir Jenison seemed very angry with his son ; and she protests that son, wife, and kindred are just now a matter of total indifference to him ; he and Sir Robert Mardynville being in daily, hourly, half-houriy correspondence, touching the de- 14*"], [388, "DIARY OF A DESENNUYEE. 212 graded social position of lhat army of martyrs the Baronets, who fancy themselves suffering under the innovations of their subs, the Knights. Her assertion was soon verified by a long and stormy argument be tween her husband and my brother-in-law ; Sir Jenison having con sulted Herbert touching Ihe invention of a badge for their injured order; and Herbert protesting they might make it a tinder-box, for any interest he felt in the subject. \" A man of ancient family, \" said he, \" is above being ennobled by such distinctions ; and a parvenu is below it. Titular distinctions, unconnected with the constitutional legislature, are in my opinion ridiculous.\" If Sir Jenison should but record this opinion, in his next communi cation to the Mardynvilles, what will they think of the degeneracy of Trentwood ! Sir Jenison, meanwhile, has exhibited, in other respects, a degree of spirit worthy the ancient dignities of the Equites aurati. He insists upon restoring lo me my deed of settlement assigning to him a sum of money in Irust for the benefit of his son, which he protests was made out solely in contemplation of a marriage between Clarence and Lady Alicia. Neither Lord Hartslon nor myself, however, will hear of ac cepting it; and it shall remain lodged in the hands of Sir Jenison's banker, till some critical moment arrives for applying it for the benefit of my cousin. By the way, Lady Cecilia informs me, that the on dits of Crockford's announce a marriage between George Hanton and old Miss Randall, who, by her speculations in the funds, is supposed lo have realized a fortune of half a million. Lady Maria de Rawdon has enclosed me an epithalamium, indited in honour of my nuptials by the fair Wilhelmina. George and Caroline Forster send me six lines of grateful respectful prose, worth volumes of such verse. None of my friends seem lo have forgotten me. * * * * Tuesday. \u2014 To-morrow !
