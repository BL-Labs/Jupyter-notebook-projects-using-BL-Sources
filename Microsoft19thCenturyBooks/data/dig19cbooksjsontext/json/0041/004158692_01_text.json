Lord Coke defines a record to be \"an authentic and uncon troulable testimony in writing, contained in rolls of parch ment, and preserved in courts of record ;\" and records are said to be \" ' Monumenta qu\u00e6 nos recorda vocamus sunt veritatis et vetustatis vestigia' \u2014 a monument of so high a nature as it imports in itself such an absolute verity, as if it be pleaded, ' there is no such record,' it shall not receive trial by wit ness, jury, or otherwise, but by itself; for, in evidence before a jury, the copy of a record will be sufficient proof of its existence and contents.\" In every age, the records of a country have been esteemed interesting to its inhabitants. They reveal the mysteries of remote ages, minister to national importance, perhaps to national vanity, and afford instructive contrast with modern times. They invite a desire of inquiry, whether they be regarded as serving to illustrate national history, or as the expositors of individual rights ; treasures of which it is difficult to decide whether they belong with a greater \" em phasis of interest\" to the civilian or to the sage ; and as they register the reminiscences either of prosperity or decay, an acquaintance with them suggests admiration of deeds of illus trious note, or detestation of ignorance or iniquity. As has been well observed : \" Science and literature have many departments, not one of which is undeserving of our regard, so long as it is cultivated in a liberal and philosophic spirit ; but the history of our own country and of its language has especial claims on our consideration. It is no morbid feeling which leads us to turn with a longing and affectionate interest to our ancient history and literature. It is no fond national conceit which inspires us with the desire to"], [14, "VI PREFACE. gather and preserve those of its scattered records which have escaped the tooth of time or the ravages of barbarism. The Grecians and the Romans were solicitous for the pre servation of their records ; and in the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians and the Assyrians we find imperishable memorials of their history and habits. In general, histories show abundant marks of ignorance and incorrectness with regard to the existence and contents of our public records, a fact of which there is uniform testimony from the days of Lord Bacon and Lord Coke to our own times. When a person engaged in historical or antiquarian research wishes to build upon the evidence of public docu- ments \u2014 the only sure foundation of historical truth \u2014 it ordi- narily happens that in the progress of his inquiry he is obliged to refer to many records, as it is obvious that the records of nations must be a principal source upon which the history of those nations ought to be founded, and it is necessary for literary men, for the establishment of truth, to verify the authorities and references of early writers, yet how few have considered the importance of them in this respect? Infinite are the aids to be found in our record repositories, if they can be but brought to light. How much of the internal convul- sions of Ireland and its position, may be ascribed to a conceal- ment, mutilation, or destruction of legal and constitutional evidences ? Such was the opinion of the late Burton Conyno-- ham, who wished to have the records of Ireland explored, authenticated and explained, after the manner of Rymer, and at the public expense ; and many valuable remains of antiquity, for want of an easy and proper access to them, have lono- been withheld from public notice. Mr. Gilbert, the learned historian of the city of Dublin states, that \" owing to the inaccuracy, neglect, and meao-re ness of previous writers, the investigator is, at the present day in his researches among unpublished and unindexed orio-inal documents, obliged to encounter difficulties and obstacles un known to those who are not conversant with the neglected state of various departments of the historic literature of Ireland \u2022\" and suggests, \" that the Government would adopt measures for"], [15, "PREFACE. VII the publication of the ancient unpublished Anglo-Irish public records, numbers of which, containing important historic materials, are now mouldering to decay ; while the unindexed and unclassified condition of those in better preservation, ren ders their contents almost unavailable to literary investigators. These observations apply more especially to the statutes and enactments of the early Anglo-Irish parliaments, upwards of twelve hundred of which still remain unpublished, although the ancient legal institutes of England, Scotland, and Wales, have been long since printed at the public expense. The most valuable illustrations of the history of the English government in Ireland are derivable from these Anglo-Irish statutes.\" Mr. Gilbert complains, that \" while in other countries the publica tion of the national records, and the labours of previous dili gent investigators, have facilitated the inquiries of historians, the total absence of such aids in this country, imposed upon him the double task of deciphering and collating the ancient documents in the various record repositories.\" The venerable Bede informs us that \" Irish academies were numerous, and her schools full of all nations ;\" historians have transmitted to us accounts of the anxiety of the Irish for the preservation of their records ; and we are informed that pre vious to the introduction of Christianity, periodical assemblies were ordered for the purpose of examining and regulating their monuments of antiquity, genealogies and chronicles; and whatever was approved of as authentic, was registered or enrolled for the benefit, of posterity. Others incorrectly assert that the Irish, before the English Conquest, had not any regular system of laws or government, or the benefit of offices of record for the custody of the material transactions of the State ; and that possibly afforded a good rea son why the history of those remote times is so mysterious and unsatisfactory. If so, the collections concerning Irish affairs from the Tower of London, contained in Rymer, Prynne, and a few others, show a material improvement in this respect. What the labours of Mr. Rymer have accomplished, in an historical way, is well known ; and from the like fund of materials some historian hereafter may be found to do credit to Ireland."], [16, "VIII PREFACE. In the great assemblies of civilized nations the rank of Ireland was once recognised. We read in Lynch, that after the revival of learning in Europe, when national preten- sions had been duly investigated, and indeed more jealously guarded, the antiquity of Ireland as a kingdom was dis- cussed before a competent tribunal. On one of those im- portant occasions, when the Kings and States of the Christian world assembled for regulating national rights, as well as other affairs of equal magnitude, and formed those great pub- lic Councils called the \" Parliaments of Christendom,\" or \" Senates of Europe,\" this point, as to Ireland's antiquity, was brought to issue. It appears by the enrolments of the French Rolls in the Tower, that a public Council was convoked in the city of Constance, and Henry the Fifth, then King of England, being unable to be personally present, as he intended, at the assembly, or, as he says, \" quia taliter pr\u00e6pediti quod ibidem juxta votum nostr\u00e6 mentis personaliter interesse nequimus,\" addressed royal letters to the other Kings of Europe requiring protection and safe conduct for the Abbot of York and other of his Abbots, then repairing to Constance, as also exemption for them, their attendants and retinue, from the usual dues payable while travelling through foreign dominions. Henry, at the same time, executed royal instruments whereby he made it known to the Council, that, being prevented from attending in person, he had appointed as his \"Ambassiatores, Oratores, veros et indubitatos, Procurators, Actores, Fac- tores et Nuncios speciales,\" the Bishops of Bath and Wells and St. David's, the Abbot of Westminster, the Earl of Warwick and others, to be present at such general Council, and in his name, and for him, to treat, discuss, and do all things neces- sary ; and the character of the men who sat in this assembly as representatives of England, may be gathered from the words of a cotemporary historian : \u2014 \" Utque de aliis taceamus, de regno Angli\u00e6 missi sunt ad concilium viri valde venera biles Salisburiensis, Bathoniensis, Herefordensis Episcopi, et cum his, Abbas Westmonasterii, Prior Wigorni\u00e6 et plures alii pollentes ingenio, religione famosi : horum c\u0153tuni honoravit multipliciter pr\u00e6sentia Comitis Warwicensis.\""], [17, "PREFACE. IX \" On the opening of this assembly, however, the rank and precedency of Henry's ambassadors in the Council became a subject of contention between them and the ambassadors of France. In favour of the latter country, while great learning and ingenuity were displayed, the cause of England was vigorously maintained, as might be expected from the rank and talents of those who represented her; and pending this contest, the affairs of Europe were laid aside, that the Council might determine this arduous question. At length the assembly gave- judgment in favour of England, and one of the principal and most cogent reasons for England having thus obtained rank and precedency over her powerful rival will be found in the following argument of the British ambassadors : \u2014 ' Satis enim constat, secundum Albertum mag num et Bartholomeum de proprietatibus rerum, quod toto mundo in tres partes diviso, viz., Asiam, Africam et Europam : Europa in quatuor dividitur regna : \u2014 primum, viz., Romanum ; secundum, Constantinopolitanum ; tertium, Regnum Hiber ni\u00e6, quod jam translatum est in Anglicos : et quartum, Reg num Hispani\u00e6 ; ex quo patet quod Rex Angli\u00e6 et regnum suum de eminentioribus antiquioribus regibus et regnis totius Europ\u00e6, quam prerogativam Regnum Franci\u00e6 non fertur obtinere.' \" Our records contain much curious and valuable informa tion, and are calculated to throw great light upon many of the principal events of the periods to which they relate, and amongst those now remaining, none are more illustrative of the time than an ancient Pipe Roll of the year 1171. By this document we find that Henry H., when about making a voy age royal into Ireland, in that year, \"proclaimed scutage throughout his dominions ; in consequence, all those hold ing in capite, by military service, were bound to accom pany the king in his expedition; and if not proceeding in person, were allowed to send so many knights, or to make pecuniary compensation, in proportion to the service due out of the estates which they held under the Crown. The purposes to which this money was applied by the king, or, under his orders, by Randulph de Glanville, are set forth"], [18, "X PREFACE. on the Roll, and the principal payments seem to have been made for the equipment, provisions, and shipping of the army, which, numerically, from those payments we can perceive far exceeded the force described by our historians ; some of the smaller items are not undeserving of notice at this day. Thus we find 26s. 2d. for gilding the king's swords; \u00a312 10s. for 1,000 lbs. of wax; 118*. Id. for 59 lbs. of almonds sent to the king in Ireland; 15s. lie?., for five carts, to bring the wardrobe of the king's household from Stafford to Chester, on their way to Ireland; \u00a310 7s. for spices and electuaries for Josephus Medicus, his Majesty's doctor; \u00a34 for a ship carry ing the armour of Robert Power; \u00a329 0s. 2d. for wine bought at Waterford ; 9s. 8d. for the carriage of the treasure from Oxford to Winton ; \u00a3333 6s. 8d. to John, the Marshall, to carry over to the king in Ireland ; and \u00a3200 to the king's chamber lain, to bring to his Majesty, on returning from that country.\"* The legal proceedings of the Saxons were transacted at the county court, and were sent to the chartulary of some adjacent monastery to be registered. Richard the First pro jected a general register for the Jewish mortgages, and Hovenden has preserved a copy of this register. Magna Charta was intended to be perpetuated, by a copy being sent to all the great monasteries for preservation and publicity. In France,- as early as the sixteenth century, it was ordered that all wills and deeds, containing \"substitutions\" of estates, should be registered within a particular period of time, under pain of being rendered disputable even to the parties in whose favour those entails were made ; but it was decreed that they were inoperative against creditors or pur chasers.f The most ancient institutes in this country are what are called the \" Brehon Laws;\" they were compiled by learned individuals, and, at a very remote age, were collected into a great body of jurisprudence; and are still extant. The Brehons were those legislators, who modelled the laws by which our early provincial judges determined all controversies * Lynch. t Beasely"], [19, "PREFACE. XI submitted to judicial investigation; and it is a source of congratulation that those venerable remnants of antiquity will shortly be presented to the public; for the Government, animated by an enlightened desire for the publication of the ancient records of the empire, have intrusted their publication to hands qualified for this interesting duty.* To the Brehon was allotted an estate of inheritance, and in criminal cases he had the eleventh part of all fines; and those laws seem to have been in general use in this country until the Statute of Kilkenny, 40\u00b0 Edward III., which prohibited the inhabitants of the Pale from submitting to trial bv Brehon Law. But, so late as the reign of Elizabeth, we find the \" Brehon\" in the full plenitude of his authority, being recog nised in that capacity in a judicial proceeding ; and, in the reign of James I., that law \"was in large operation in the kingdom.\" It is a source of regret that we have not a perfect series of records, from the commencement in this country of the Eng lish Government : occasioned by the decay of time ; by the negligence of officers ; by the insecurity in which they were kept ; and by casualties from fire. No public repository was devoted to their safe custody, nor was proper care taken for their preservation. The Talbots, Carews, Perrotts, and other illustrious personages, the Secretaries, Presidents, and Lord Lieutenants of Ireland, during their brief sojourn in this country, appear to have collected all the valuable MSS. within their reach ; and on the expiration of their office, and return to their own more tranquil homes, to have carried with them the most valuable and interesting records of the country \u2014 some of which are now to be found in the State Paper Office, the Record Office, Rolls Chapel, the Museum, the Lambeth, Cottonian, Harleian, Lansdown, and Bodleian Li braries, in the last of which are-\u00abpreserved the Perrott MSS., and amongst them the letters of Sir John Perrott to the Queen and her ministry, while he was Lord Deputy of Ireland, from * On the Memoranda Roll of the 25 \u00b0 and 26 \u00b0 Edward III. we find \"Ordinances\" of that King (not noticed in the statutes of the realm), reciting, \"Whereas, heretofore, by reason of debates between English and English, they have used to be governed by the law of the Marches and of tlie Brehon, which is not law, nor ought to be law : it is accordingly ordained, that neither be henceforth held between them.\""], [20, "XII PREFACE. July 2, 1584, to May 26, 1586. Amongst the MSS. Rawlin son is the \" Statutum de Hibernia ;\" and Orders of Parliament, transferred to the Select Committee, appointed to take care of the affairs of Ireland. We may thus account for the wealth of the Chandos Papers, and those in the possession, more than a century since, of Sterne, then Bishop of Clogher, so often mentioned in Nicholson's Historica Library. Of these, Madden and Sterne's collections were given to the Col lege of T.C.D., where they now remain ; and hence we may account for the Carew MS. at Lambeth, and those at Oxford, brought there during the civil wars, when Charles the First carried on the government, and held parliaments in that city, and those contained in Lord Orrery's Library at Christ Church. Indeed, almost every country in Europe abounds with Irish documents. In the reign of Edward I. an Inn was established in the city of Dublin, called \" Collett's Inn,\" which lay outside the Avails of the city, and here the superior courts of justice were held. Soon an incident, natural to the then state of Ireland, disturbed their tranquillity. A band of Irish from the Wicklow mountains watched an opportunity, whilst the Deputy and a greater part of the garrison were on a military tour, and concealing themselves in thick woods to the southward of Dublin, unexpectedly entered, plundered the Exchequer, burned the records, and slew the unarmed and unprepared inhabitants. On this occasion the legal prac titioners were driven within the walls of the city, and the superior courts of justice were afterwards held at the Castle, and at Carlow, which was then considered an impregnable fortress, on the southern frontier of the English Pale. In the reign of Edward II. almost all the early records of the kingdom perished ; which fact we find thus recorded on the Patent Rolls: \u2014 \"Be it remembered that all the Rolls of the Chancery of Ireland were, in the time of Master Thomas Cantock, Chancellor of Ireland, to the 28th year of King Edward, son to King Henry III., destroyed by an accidental fire, in the Abbey of the Blessed Vim-in, near Dublin, at the time when the abbey was burnt down, except"], [21, "PREFACE. XIII two Rolls of the same year, which were delivered to Master Walter de Thornbury by the king's writ.\" The two Rolls here mentioned yet remain, and one, entitled \" Antiquissim\u00e6 Liter\u00e6 Patentes,\" contains several interesting charters and muniments of an historical nature. This loss is partly supplied by Cambrensis, Regan, and the Abbot Benedict, writers contemporary with the actions they relate; but more amply by the collections from the Tower Records, London, by Prynne, Rymer, and by Baluzius's edition of the \" Decretal Epistles of Pope Innocent III. ;\" to which may be added the \" Crede Mihi,\" \" Alan's Registry,\" the \"Black Book of Christ Church,\" and the \"Red Book of the Exchequer,\" compiled in the reign of Edward I., entitled, \"Status Scaccarii Dublin in Hibernia;\" which treats of the officers of the Exchequer, their salaries and business, of records; and mentions that a certain great book, called \" Doomsday,\" had, for want of care, been burnt with other records. At Waterford there was an ancient treasury of public records, of statutes sent from England, and exem plifications of State papers: on one occasion, when there was a distress for rent, those records were tossed out of the windows, into the street. Mr. Monk Mason informs us that the Mayor made a bonfire of the Rolls and Records which lumbered the Tholsel in that city; and a fire at Lismore Castle added yet further to the devastation. We can trace several documents to this castle, but there we lose sight of them altogether; and Nicholson mentions that be fore the time when Addison became keeper of the Tower Records, many of these had been miserably neglected and embezzled. In the reign of Henry VII., Ireland was a scene of tumult and violence. At this period, in the town of Trim, in a strong castle, the records of the country, for security, were deposited. They were seized on by O'Neill, and utterly destroyed; and thus the documents, serving for evidence to constitute the title of the Crown to property, perished. To remedy as far as possible the inconvenience to be apprehended from such a state of things, Henry VII."], [22, "PREFACE. XIV procured an Act to be passed in the tenth year of his reign, entitled, the \" Statute of Resumption,\" by which the Crown seized into its hands \" all the castles, manors, and lordships of March, Ulster, Trim, and Connaught, which had been annexed to our Sovereign Lord the King's Crown ; and that all such records, rolls, and inquisitions as were remaining of record in the Treasury of Trim, and as should entitle our Sovereign Lord to all such lordships and manors of late, were taken and embezzled by divers persons of malice prepense.\" This Act, and the state of things which it was intended to remedy, as far as the interests of the Crown were affected by it, clearly show how difficult it was for those deriving under it to establish their title by muniments or documentary evi dence, which had been all stolen and destroyed ; and it was a mere chance that suffered a few, such as the Patent, Plea, Close, Statute, and Memoranda Rolls to escape. This Statute is a parliamentary assertion of the rights of the Crown ; it sets forth that the records were stolen from Trim and destroyed, and provides a remedy therefor ; but what pro vision was made for those holding immediately from the Crown by patent? \u2014 who, in the absence of those records, could prove a title to his ancestral possessions ? Was this the cause, two centuries later, of Lord Strafford issuing that famous \"Commission for Defective Titles,\" by which every pro prietor in the West was dispossessed, unless he could show, in writing, a clear, indisputable, indefeasible title from the Crown ? But how few records remained will be found in the fact, that when the same Lord Strafford sought to find the title of his patron, Charles the First, to the entire province of Connaught, upon an inquiry held at Galway, he pro duced in evidence this Statute of 10\u00b0 Henry VII. to show the loss of the records, and to maintain the title of the Crown in their absence. Henry VIII., in the twenty-fifth year of his reign, writing to the Lord Deputy and Council, states, \"We have, by sundry means, perceived that our records in Ireland have not been so well kept and preserved as appertained, whereof have ensued divers inconveniences ; our pleasure is, that you,"], [23, "PREFACE. XV our Deputy, take order that no man be suffered to take away any of the same where they be kept, nor to search for them but in the presence of our trusty clerks, with such further direction for the safe keeping of them as to your wisdom shall be thought convenient.\" In 1537 the Master of the Rolls informed the Commis sioners of Reformation, \" that, if steps were not taken for re building the castle wall, where the law is kept, the majestie and estimation of the lawe shall peryshe ; the Justices being then enforced to minister the lawes upon hylles, as it were Brehons or wild Irishmen on their Eriotts.\" In the year 1551, the Lords of the Council stated, that they were informed by the Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls that \" there was no place certain or convenient for the safe guard of the records and muniments of Chancery, other than the tower within the Castle, which was both ruinous and far distant from the cathedral, where the courts were held, being not a place suitable for the daily resort of the officers and others, his Majesty's subjects, having charge or occasion to have sight or copies of them; and the Library of Saint Patrick's Cathedral was considered a secure place for the safe guard and custody of the records and muniments, near unto the Courts. It was accordingly ordered that the said library should be the place for the safe-keeping of such of the records as were to be kept out of the tower ; and that the Clerk of the Hanaper should provide presses or stages, chests, door and locks for the sure keeping and good ordering of the said records.\" On the 12th June, 1559, Lord Deputy Sidney appointed four persons to sort the records in Bermingham Tower, and for so doing they were to receive \u00a32 each. In 1587, Lord Deputy Perrott issued a warrant for Robert Legg to get \u00a340, for making calendars and repertories ; and on the occasion of Sir Nicholas White, Master of the Rolls, being sent to the Tower, \"for abusing and non-using his office,\" by order dated 28th April, 1591, the records, rolls, and writings belonging to his office were committed to the care of Serjeant Fitz simons, who was nominated, in the place of Sir Nicholas, \" to"], [24, "PREFACE. XVI sit in the Court of Chancery, and hear the Causes depending in that Court ;\" and James Ryan, the Chief Clerk of the Rolls, delivered them accordingly. We find Lord Strafford, in one of his letters (vol. i., p. 527), complaining \" That there was not a place set apart for his Majesty's records, and the want of treasuries for them hath been of mighty hinderance to the king and subject, wherein many records that might be of public profit and service to his Majesty, and of security and advantage to the subject, have been, for want of this (repository), lost or embezzled, or some times burnt; the offices being kept, as most records were, in the officer's house, to the extreme prejudice of his Majesty and his subjects in their several interests.\" Sir Charles Wandesford, Master of the Rolls, in the reign of Charles I., built, at his own cost, the Rolls Office, in Dame street, \"a stately brick building, of three stories, and in it a large room for a safe repository of the rolls ; he prepared boxes, and presses of new oak, with partitions indicating the year of our Lord, and reign of each king.\" Charles II., on the 14th March, in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, caused a commission to issue, directed to the Lord Lieutenant, and others, which recites \" that several lands, to which the king is entitled, still remain undisposed of, the occupiers of which are, therefore, much disquieted, on the pretence that their titles are defective, and by discoveries that have been endeavoured to be made thereof.\" It then proceeds to state, \"that, to remedy these inconveniences, Commis sioners have been appointed with authority to compound with persons holding lands under the circumstances above recited, and to grant them new tenures, direct from the Crown, for such fines and rents and under such tenures as the Commis sioners shall think fit,\" with a special proviso, however, that in all such new grants or confirmations the rent paid to the king must be reserved. This commission, from its similarity to former patents, issued by James I. and Charles I., was stiled, like them, a \"Commission of Grace.\" The death of Charles II. determined it ; but, as several proprietors who had applied for new patents under it, and who had, pre-"], [25, "PREFACE. XVII viously to the king's demise, lodged the consideration money required by the Commissioners, had not procured patents ; a king's letter was issued, 21st April, in the first year of the ensuing reign, directing that the patents of all such as were so circumstanced should be completed. These grants being subsequent to those of the Acts of Settlement and Explanation, and appearing, to a certain extent, to have arisen out of them, may be considered as forming a sequel or appendage to the Acts above referred to, and were, therefore, considered deserving by the late Clerk of Enrolments, to have their contents digested into a special abstract, of similar character to the abstracts of the grants published by the directions of the late Commissioners for arranging the public records, not only for the convenience of official reference, but to facilitate the researches made, and every year increasing in number, relative to property under those Acts. On the rebuilding of the Dublin law courts in 1695, the law offices of the various courts were removed to \"Cock hill,\" where the office of the Chief Remembrancer was kept. The insecurity and inconvenience of the offices there, occa sioned the Chief Remembrancer and the Clerk of the Pleas to represent to the official authorities \" That the former patentees of the offices were necessitated to remove their offices to Cock-hill; that the offices are in great danger of fire, by reason of the adjacent houses being timber work ; that the offices are very inconvenient and extremely too narrow and strait to lay up the records conveniently, and in order as they should be kept ; and humbly offered that they could not find out any convenient and safe place to remove their offices to, nor indeed could there be any security for the re cords until offices and repositories should be built, in some secure and convenient place, for the preservation of the re cords, which were very numerous.\" In 1697, after the Legislature had passed an enactment annulling all the proceedings of the Irish Parliament of James II. ; the Lord Deputy. Henry Lord Capel, and the Privy Council, assembled in the Council Chamber on the 2nd October, and the Act having been read, the Clerk of 6"], [26, "PREFACE. XVIII the Crown and the Deputy Keeper of the Rolls, who attended by order, brought in all the records, rolls, journals, and other papers in their custody relating to the Acts of James the Second. The door of the Council Chamber was then set open, and the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Commons of the city of Dublin, with many other persons, being present, the records, journals, and other papers were publicly cancelled and burned. In the year 1711 a number of the volumes of the maps of the Down Survey, taken by Sir William Petty, in the years 1655 and 1656, by order of Government, were totally de stroyed by a fire which took place in a house in Essex-street, where the Surveyor-General's office was then kept. We must regret the loss on that occasion of the petitions and proceed ings of the Court of Claims, and other records of great interest. The Down Survey, before the lire, consisted of thirty-one folio volumes, divided into baronial and parochial maps. At present there remain in the office of the Surveyor-General 1,430 maps, of which 260 are of the baronies, and the remain ing 1,170 of the parishes. An original volume of the baro nial maps is at present preserved in the Quit Rent Office. In order to supply the deficiencies occasioned by the fire above-mentioned, General Vallancey, by command of George III., and with the permission of the French King, was em ployed to take copies from a set of barony maps of the Down Survey, which had been captured by a French privateer, on the passage from Ireland to England, and deposited in the French king's library in Paris ; which copies are much more explicit and comprehensive than the barony maps now in the Surveyor-General's Office, and annexed to those of the parishes ; these containing but the parochial sub-division of the baronies, whilst those copied from the set in Paris contain not only the same, but also the boundaries and title of each denomination, and other particulars, besides a reference by numbe.-. which corresponds with the number and particulars contained in the books of survey and distribution preserved in the late Auditor-General's and Surveyor-General's Offices. The manuscripts which Sir James Ware (author of the"], [27, "PREFACE, XIX \"Annals of Ireland\") had collected with great trouble and expense, were brought to England by Lord Clarendon, in the reign of James H., and afterwards sold to the Duke of Chan dos. On the Duke's death the documents passed to Dean Milles, who bequeathed them to the British Museum, where they now form the principal portion of the collection known as the \" Clarendon Manuscripts.\" In the year 1730 the attention of Parliament was called to the state of the public records, and a Committee of the Lords was appointed to report thereon; and, on the 30th November, their report was printed, in which it is stated that \"their Lord ships adjourned first to the Rolls Office, in the King's Inns, in which were kept the enrolments of all grants, &c, and they found several rooms, in two sides of the building, inhabited by very low poor people. In these rooms were many fire places, the hearths of which were narrow and broken, and some of th6m were raised above the floor ; there were also there deal partitions, straw beds, and other combustible stuff. If, through the carelessness or villainy of these people, a fire should break out in any of their chambers, as there is a com munication between them and the office where the rolls and pleadings were lodged, their Lordships thought they would run a manifest hazard of being burnt to the ground, and this hazard they apprehended to be greater because these Inns were reported a privileged place, though in reality they were not, and the inhabitants of these rooms were generally such as drunkenness and other vices had made necessitous, who fled thither for sanctuary.\" The Pleas Office of the Exchequer, in the year 1732, was in Castle-street, with houses close joining the office on both' sides, and on one side there was some of cage-work ; on which account the Lords Committee \" thought it too much exposed to accidents from fire ; and as in this department, and those of the King's Bench and Common Pleas, were the titles of almost all the judgment creditors, the Lords Committee observed, that judgments, being one of the common securities of the kingdom, the destruction of the records of any one of b 2"], [28, "XX PREFACE. these offices would leave a multitude of creditors at the mercy of their debtors.\" In the year 1739, the Lords Committee reported that the King's Bench Office was in Schoolhouse-lane. The clerk informed the Lords Committee that about two years previously a fire broke out very near the office, which gave them a great alarm ; and their lordships state that, \" in this office are kept the outlawries and attainders, those parti cularly of Papists, on account of the rebellions in 1641 and 1688 ; and if these should be burned, the Committee fear that the Protestant successors would, at best, be exposed to vexatious law suits, to defend and establish their titles to many forfeited estates.\" Their lordships further observe, \" that the public records which concern the property of the whole kingdom, were liable to be distrained for rent ; and that upon the death of the officers, they must, for a time, be in the power of their representatives, who, should they prove corrupt or negligent, might in a few hours destroy multitudes of them.\" In 1760, the Deputy Keeper of the Rolls described the record repository as in a very ruinous condition, though much better, he states, than for many years past, being re paired at great expense by Mr. Rigby, Master of the Rolls. At this period the King's Bench Office was kept in School house-lane ; the office of the Prothonotary of the Common Pleas, in Winetavern-street; Keeper of the Writs, in Bride street ; the Pleas Officer of the Exchequer, in Castle-street ; and the Chief Remembrancer's Office, in Kennedy 's-lane', not one being in a safe or commodious situation. Although the Irish Parliament frequently directed their attention to the records of this country, and repeatedly evinced their opinion of the importance of the subject, yet they appear to have principally confined their anxiety to pro viding buildings for their safe keeping, but to have taken no steps towards affording information or facilitating inquiries into the contents of those records ; and although both houses of the Irish Parliament, in the years 1721 and 1791, called for such returns, yet the statements given pursuant to their"], [29, "PREFACE. XXI orders were defective and valueless, and the subject was soon forgotten amidst the discussion of matters at that time consi dered of more vital consequence. At length, in the year 1810, a Royal Commission issued for the better regulation of the records in Ireland, which were then \"in a state of great confusion.\" By it the Commissioners were directed \" to methodize, regulate, and digest the records, rolls, books, and papers, in the public offices or repositories ; to cause such of the records, rolls, instruments, or papers, as were decayed and in danger of being destroyed, to be bound and secured ; to make perfect calendars and indices thereof, and to superintend the printing of such of the calendars, in dices, and original records, as they should cause to be printed.\" The necessity for this proceeding will be found in a report ordered by the House of Commons to be printed, dated 7th July, 1830, where it is stated, that \" in consequence of the confusion and dispersion of the records through various offices, it became necessary to undertake the laborious pri mary process of collecting and arranging them in the proper repositories to which they belonged ; as also of forming ab stracts in order to provide the materials of many works for press or fair transcript, wherein several years were consumed and considerable expense incurred.\" These obstacles and difficulties, and the necessity of these preliminary proceedings, were laid before Parliament in a report of the Commissioners, in which it is also observed, \" that with the exception of Lodge's MS. works, there did not exist in any repository a single calendar, repertory, index, or inventory, that the Com mission could avail itself \u2022of in the progress of its labours, or by any correction render useful to the public ; all was to be done anew, and the pile raised from the foundation.\"' The Commissioners proceeded with their onerous task, but the work was not in active operation until February, 1811 ; the intermediate time having been occupied in ascertaining the contents of the several record repositories, by means of queries directed by the Board, and transmitted by their Secre tary to the officers and keepers of such repositories. In adopt ing this process, measures were taken, not only for ascertain-"], [30, "PREFACE. XXII ing the contents of those repositories, but also for collecting such local information as might be useful in the progress of the Comnlission. The result was laid before the Board at their second meeting, on the 18th of February, 1811, in a report made by the Secretary on the several answers returned to the transmitted queries. Sub-Commissioners were then appointed by the Board, to arrange, methodize, and to form catalogues, repertories, and indices to the contents of the fol lowing repositories: viz., Bermingham Tower, Parliamentary Record Office, Rolls Office, Chief Remembrancer's Office, and Auditor-General's Office. Sub-Commissioners( were also appointed to prepare and print an authentic edition of the Irish Statutes, according to the plan adopted in England. At this period it appears that considerable difficulties pre sented themselves, arising principally from the deranged state of the records, and the very imperfect knowledge of their contents possessed by those persons in whose custody they had been placed, two or three only of whom had been found competent to read the more ancient writings. Those inte resting memorials lay buried in sepulchral vaults and cham bers of the Law Courts, the Tower, and the Castle. The mouldering obscurity in which the most precious archives of the kingdom had so long reposed, was not favourable to their preservation, many decayed and perished in the catacombs in which they were entombed, and no inconsiderable number has been, doubtless, purloined. The dark cloud that so long rested on those repositories concealed the origin and early progress of our early judicial institutions and Parliament, and the most esteemed general and local histories abounded with numerous and grievous errors. The state of disorder and confusion into which the records of the principal repositories had fallen is very fully detailed in Lord Chancellor Redes dale's report upon the subject to the Earl of Hardwicke, and in the Reports of the English Sub-Commissioners, who visited Ireland in 1806 and 1812. In the year 1812, returns having been obtained from all the record repositories, Sub-Commissioners were appointed"], [31, "PREFACE. XXIII for arranging and methodizing the contents of the State Papers, and of the Prerogative and First Fruits Offices. At the same time the subject of schedules and inventories of the books and papers in the Surveyor-General's Office, and of the maps of the Down Survey, appears also to have engaged the attention of the Board ; and, accordingly, a Committee from their body investigated and reported upon various important matters connected with that valuable record. The attention of the Commissioners appears further to have been directed to that part of the late Mr. Lodge's MSS., containing a list of patentee offices, which they directed to be prepared for pub lication. In the following year they ordered one of their Sub- Commissioners to complete the Catalogue of the MSS. of Trinity College, for printing; and in 1814, when some pro gress had been made in the principal offices and repositories, Sub-Commissioners were appointed to complete the \"Ada Regia Hibernica :\" a work that had been commenced by Mr. Lodge and found amongst his manuscripts. The Commissioners, by their report of the year 1819, re viewing the proceedings which had been taken by the Com mission since its commencement, state that their attention had been directed, in conformity with the powers vested -in them, not only to the arrangement, preservation, and more conve nient use of the contents of the principal record repositories in Ireland, but also to such works as would bring to light and preserve the authentic memorials of the property, laws, and government of this part of the United Kingdom. The Dio cesan and County Records, and the necessity of their com plete security and preservation, also came under the consider ation of the Board ; but measures respecting them were neces sarily postponed until some progress should be made in investigating the principal repositories, in Dublin. In Bermingham Tower a large quantity of mutilated and injured records was found, which, until that time, lay un explored; and it was expected that amongst them would be found some of a date more ancient than the oldest known to be preserved in the department, particularly those during the reigns of Henry II. and King John. But such hopes were"], [32, "XXIV PREFACE. found delusive, although in a manuscript preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin (Class F, Shelf 3, No. 13), it is stated that, before the year 1680, there was amongst those records a Roll of the Pipe of the 13th and 14th years of King John: \" In eodem archivo sire tiirri, est unus rotulus pip\u0153, an' 13 & 14 R. John\" ibidem etiam sunt diversi Rotuli Pip\u00e6 qui clam Rot' comun' placitor' tempore Hen. III.\" No Roll of the reign of King John was found in that repository; but there was discovered a fragment of a Pipe Roll of the 13\u00b0 & 14p Henry III., which happened to begin with the word '< Johannes\" (being the Christian name of the first person occurring on it), and which, from that circumstance, was mis taken for a Roll of King John. The Commissioners on Municipal Corporations acknow ledge they were unable to discover certain collections, made by the late Record Commissioners, from the records between the 18th of Richard II. and 1st of James I. (a period of about 200 years) ; but that they had endeavoured to supply the deficiencies by reference to the original records within their reach. They state, in a note, \" they have reason to believe that early records of the Irish Corporations were to be found in the Tower of London and other repositories in England, to which they had not the opportunity of referring.\" In the year 1815 the first volume of the reports of the Commissioners was presented to the public : it contains the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth Annual Reports, with Sup plements, and the returns from the several record offices, and the state of the records in each. The second volume appeared in 1820, and contains the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Annual Reports, and, in addition, comprises Catalogues and Inventories of the Contents of the Bermingham Tower Record Room, the Parliamentary Record Office, the State Paper Room in the Record Tower, the Surveyor-General's and Auditor-General's Office, the Rolls, the Chief Remem brancer's Offices, the Quit-Rent Office, and the Prerogative Office. The third volume appeared in 1825, and contains an abstract and reference to the principal records and pub he documents connected with the Acts of Settlement and"], [33, "PREFACE. XXV Explanation, preserved in the Rolls and Chief Remembrancer's Offices. In the year 1812 an incomplete work, entitled, \" Liber Munerum Publicorum Hiberni\u00e6, or the Establishments of Ireland,\" was undertaken to be printed under the direction of the Record Commissioners, from a collection of MS. books, formed by Mr. Lodge (Deputy Keeper of the Rolls and of the Records in Bermingham Tower) from the Patent and Close Rolls. Mr. Duhigg, of the King's Inns, who had collected further materials for extending the subjects of Mr. Lodge's volumes, was appointed a Sub-Commissioner, and directed to complete two volumes (part of those collections) of patentee offices for publication. In the Third Report of the Commis sioners, vol. i., pp. 481 and 486, it is stated that a plan for an edition of Lodge's list of patentee offices was laid before the Board by Mr. Duhigg, but not adopted : and the printing of the work was suspended until progress should be made with the Repertory to the Patent Rolls ; and Mr. Rowley Lascelles, in 1813, was appointed a Sub-Commissioner, and Mr. Duhiggs coadjutor ; and they were appointed to prepare a plan of the work, confining their attention to the documents from which Mr. Lodge had formed his lists. The plan having been laid be fore the Commissioners, Mr. Lascelles was directed to carry it into execution without illustration. \"In consequence of some disagreement with the Irish Record Commissioners, Mr. Lascelles returned to England about the year 1820, and agreed with the Government, in 1822, to com pile and edit the work, unconnected with the Irish Record Commission. This agreement was made with the Right Hon ourable Henry Goulbourn, then Secretary for Ireland ; and Mr. Lascelles was engaged on the work until the year 1830, when it was determined, upon certain representations, not to proceed with the work, and it was suspended, in January, 1830, by an order of the Irish Secretary, Lord Francis Egerton. On the 1st November, 1831, Mr. Stewart, the Secretary of the Treasury, addressed a letter to the Commis sioners of Records for England, requesting them to examine the work. Their report was made in February, 1832, to the"], [34, "XXVI PREFACE. Treasury; and from the representations contained in that report of its incompleteness, imperfections, and improper in troduction of irrelevant matter, and the great expense in re vising and remodelling it, the work, consisting of seven parts, was not then proceeded with. Considering, however, that the work had been found useful by many persons, and that great expense had been incurred, it was at length determined to allow the work to appear without incurring further expense in completing it; and although the Commissioners recom mended that the supplement to the \" History of England,\" or \" Res Gest\u00e6 Anglorum in Hibernia,\" should be suppressed, as well as other matters, for introducing which Mr. Lascelles had no authority; but as the expense of printing had been incurred, it was thought better to publish it as Mr. Lascelles left it, \" the merits or demerits of the work belonging to that gentleman.\" Accordingly, in 1852, two large folio volumes were published ; but it is to be regretted, as Mr. Lascelles him self acknowledged, various portions are given in an imperfect and unmethodical form. Lists have been printed, with notices at the end that they would be verified at a future time, and corrected in a subsequent sheet. Besides this, there is a want of system in the arrangement ; the different lists are often separated instead of being amalgamated, occasioning repeti tions and confusion. Chronological order has not been duly observed ; in some instances the series which ought to precede in chronological order is made to follow a list of later date. Illustrative matter not strictly in keeping with the character of the work is introduced, such as biographical sketches, anec dotes, and epitaphs ; yet, with every defect and irregularity, the collection constitutes a storehouse of information relatino to the official history of Ireland. In the year 1826 the Commissioners published a volume, entitled \" Inquisitionum in Officio Rotulorum Cancellari\u00e6 asservatorum repertorium ;\" and, in the year 1829, a second volume. The first, containing a repertory to the Inquisitions in the Rolls Offices, and comprising the several counties within the province of Leinster ; the second volume, those of Ulster. The inquisitions post mortem were"], [35, "PREFACE. XXVII taken under Commissions, directed to the escheators of each province, finding by the oath of a jury what lands any person died seized of, by what rents and services they were held, who was the next heir, and his a.ge ; by which the right of the Crown to escheat or wardship was ascertained. In the meantime, in 1828, was published the first part of the first volume, entitled \" Rotulorum Patentium et Clau sorum Cancellari\u00e6 Hiberni\u00e6 Calendarium,\" from the reign of Henry II. to the reign of Henry VII. ; but this Calendar, like its predecessor, the Calendar to the Inquisitions, being printed in the abbreviated, antiquated Latin of the period, has been to the public, for all practical purposes, almost useless. The Commissioners proceeded so far as having put to press a Calendar to the Rolls of James I., to the 15th year of his reign, in English, when the sudden suspension of the Record Com mission, in 1830, put an end to their labours ; leaving incom plete the Inquisitions of Munster and Connaught, the Patent Rolls of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, Elizabeth, a large portion of the reign of James I., the Memoranda, Com munia, Plea, Statute, Pipe Rolls, and other records of the subsequent reigns. It is a source of great regret that the Irish Record Com mission, so ably conducted and so laboriously pursued, was thus unexpectedly suspended in the midst of its labours ; what they were able to accomplish, was, if necessary, on additional proof of the imperative necessity for the completion of the duties they were prevented from performing. In the arrangement and classification of the records in the public archives, much good was effected by the Commissioners, by means of which research has been facilitated, and the in quirer directed in his pursuits, by the publication of descrip tive catalogues and repertories. How-ever, just at the period when the public were about to reap the benefit of the great expenditure that had been incurred, the labours of the Commission in this country were abruptly terminated ; inso much that some works partly printed, and several prepared for publication, were all abandoned and left in a crude and unfinished state."], [36, "XXVIII PREFACE. What further measures the Commissioners contemplated we have now no means of ascertaining : the sudden revocation of the Commission paralyzed the works they had in process of publication ; and the records of the country from that period were suffered to relapse into their accustomed oblivion. The late John Caillard Erck had in contemplation the pub lication of a Calendar to the Patent Rolls of James I., and had proceeded as far as the seventh year of the reign of that king (forming a very valuable volume), when his death put an end to a work which he performed with credit able fidelity and talent. Since that period nothing whatever has been done in relation to the publication of the Irish records, or any assistance afforded the public, notwithstanding the obvious necessity of a clue through a labyrinth so exten sive and so intricate, if we may except a valuable auxiliary for the investigation of records of antiquity, of interest and importance, connected with this country, namely, the volume compiled by the officers of the Trigonometrical Survey. Although only one volume has been published, and that in relation to a single parish, yet from the sample it affords, that work would probably have opened a mine of wealth, not only to the antiquary or investigator, but to the nation at large. Amongst the most important of the Irish records are the Plea Rolls. They comprise 593 Rolls, from the year 1220 to the reign of Charles I. ; they afford valuable information, relating to the country in general, and form an interesting monument of English jurisprudence in its earliest age in this country. They consist of Pleas of the Crown, Assize of novel disseisin, mort d'auncestor, inquisitions, pleadings in real actions, respecting manors, lands, and hereditaments, many of them anciently the property of the Crown and Church ; prosecutions for trespasses in royal forests ; actions of dower ; waste ; writs of right of advowsons, Darrien presentment, quare impedit, and certiorari from inferior courts. They also con tain enrolments of appointments of the Justices and Officers of the Courts ; charters, patents, and deeds ; with many sub jects of a miscellaneous nature, which may be attributed to the practice that prevailed at an early period of making such"], [37, "PREFACE. XXIX records, in a great measure, journals of all proceedings in the Courts. The Pipe Rolls comprise 184 rolls. They are principally composed of the returns of the receipt and expenditure of the royal revenue, contained in escheators' and sheriffs' accounts ; among which are found references to grants of lands and money made by different monarchs ; the value of ecclesiastical livings seized into the king's hands, by vacancy of sees or otherwise; exemplifications of the Statute of Westminster against absentees, tempore Henry VI. ; accounts of laymen's lands seized into the king's hands, and vei'y frequently curious topographical information, prisage of wines, king's customs and revenues, quit rents, wardships, and escheats: in addition to this general information, both the Plea and Pipe Rolls throw great light on the title to private property, and the gene alogy of the principal persons in the kingdom, and are inter esting as pourtraying the progress and development of the Anglo-Norman jurisprudence in this country, containing, as they do, most valuable information respecting its history, laws, and antiquities. But the want of calendars or repertories to our records has been severely felt. The public, uninstructed, come to the offices in the feeble hope of getting some information from records likely to assist them, and have wholly to rely on the activity or talent of the officer in charge for success. It may be mentioned here, in illustration of how our ancient MSS. have been appreciated, that on a late inquiry at the office of that most efficient and accomplished officer, the Ulster King at-Arms, in relation to a legal question of great importance then pending, I was informed that the repertory and indices to the Plea and Pipe Rolls were in the hands of a private indi vidual ; and, although subsequently every exertion was made to procure those invaluable calendars, for the benefit of the public, they were publicly sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, in London, a few months since. The various ancient Rolls of the Exchequer comprise a series of important and interesting legal information ; valuable for the lawyer and the historian. They begin in the 6\u00b0"], [38, "XXX PREFACE. Edward I., and continue to the present time, during which period they have been kept in an uninterrupted series, with the exception of some few chasms, the most considerable of which occur during the reign of Edward I. The Memoranda Rolls, properly so called, appear to com mence in the 1st Edward II., and comprise 393 Rolls, up to the 12\u00b0 Anne. To these an incomplete index, which was afterwards sold to Sir William Betham, was prepared by the late William Lynch (author of the Feudal Dignities). Some few years since, anxiety to acquire a knowledge of those valu able records induced me, in the intervals of professional relaxa tion, to undertake the difficult task of preparing four volumes of indices to those interesting muniments; by which means I became familiar with them, and was thus enabled, on many occasions, to refer the professional and literary inquirer to their invaluable contents. The Patent Rolls of Chancery commence in the reiojn of Edward I., and are continued down to the present time. Upon these Rolls are contained the enrolments of grants in fee or perpetuity, for lives and years ; of Crown lands, abbey lands, and escheated lands ; patents of creations of honour ; grants of charters of incorporation and liberties ; grants of offices, denizations, ferries, and fisheries ; patents for inventions, and specifications ; licences and pardons of alienation ; pre sentations ; promotions to bishoprics and deaneries ; special licences; grants of wardships ; commissions; inquisitions post mortem and on attainder ; orders of Council ; depositions of witness in perpetuam rei rriernorietm ,- deeds ; conveyances ; grants in custodiam ; grants of manors and all then- appur tenances, and of fairs and markets ; surrenders of lands and offices to the Crown ; summonses to Parliament ; bonds ; obligations ; replevins ; pardons ; letters of attorney ; licences for officers to treat with the Irish; treaties; Papal bulls; proclamations; letters of protection; writs of cnnovea., manas of possessions taken by the Crown ; writs of ouster lemain , deeds and conveyances ; King's letters ; mils ; commissions for the survey, apportionment, and erection of counties ; for remedy of defective titles ; for the appointment of Justices and"], [39, "PREFACE. XXXI Commissioners, as well civil as military ; for the conversion of lands held by the Irish custom of tanistry into the English custom of tenure ; and on various other subjects. The next class of records preserved in this office are the Close Rolls. The oldest is one of the 20\u00b0 Edward II. It contains liberates, writs of various kinds, pardons of aliena tion, recognizances, deeds, and an article entitled \" Statutum de Hidernia.\" Those Rolls do not appear to have been con tinued in regular succession ; some occur in the reigns of Richard II., Henry IV., Henry VI., Edward IV., Henry VII., Edward VI., Elizabeth, and Charles I. It is observable that any distinction which might originally have existed between the Close and Patent Rolls was discontinued in course of time, although the name of the former was still preserved ; for both species of Rolls contain matters of a similar kind, and in no instance is there a Close and Patent Roll for the same year, which, if they were meant to be distinct in their nature, could not but in some instance have been the case ; and\" as far back as the books of reference to the Rolls extend, the Close Rolls are referred to without any distinction between the Patent Rolls and them. The Statute Rolls, comprising both the public and private Statutes passed in the Irish Parliament, commence in the reign of Henry VI. They include the reigns of Henry VI., Edward IV, Richard III., Henry VII., Henry VIII., Philip and Mary, Elizabeth, and James I., and comprise forty-five Rolls. They are without any calendar or index to the 11\u00b0 James I. From this period to 1715, the public and private Acts being promiscuously enrolled together on the same series of Rolls, an imperfect calendar was at that time made, of both kinds of Acts; but from 1715 to 1800, inclusive, when our Parliament ceased, the private Acts being enrolled separately, there was a regular catalogue and index made to those private Acts (but to the entire exclusion of all the public Acts), which is in good order. The Statute Rolls, prior to 10\u00b0 Henry VII., are all in Norman-French, the then legal as well as general language of the Court ; and as there are printed Statutes long prior to the oldest Parliamentary"], [40, "PREFACE. XXXII Roll appearing here, some of the more ancient of those Rolls must have been lost. The late Record Commissioners stated in their report, that they met with a MS. note, written about the year 1634, in one of the old reference books in the office, by which it appeared that a Parliamentary Roll of Edward III., was then in the possession of the Lord Primate, Arch bishop^ Usher. The Recognizance Rolls commence in the reign of Henry VIII. ; the latest is one of the 10\u00b0 Charles I. They are about twenty in number, and are, in general, in good preservation; but as there is no index of any kind to them in. the office, no reference has been made to them for many years, and their contents are almost entirely unknown. The Rolls of Cromwell commence in 1653, and end in 1659. They contain some grants and charters, but mostly deeds and other memoranda. They form part of the series of Patent Rolls. The Decrees of the Court of Chancery, preserved here, commence in the 24\u00b0 Henry VIII. There is a chasm in those Rolls, from 1643 to 1655, owing to the suspension of business by the dissensions in this kingdom during that period. Thence, until the Restoration, there are Rolls of the decrees and adjudications of the Commissioners for the ad ministration of Justice in Ireland. The decrees or certifi cates of the Commissioners appointed for executing the Acts of Settlement and Explanation are separately preserved, and are in very good condition. The Convert Rolls commence in 1 703, and contain the enrol ments of bishops' and ministers' certificates to such persons as had conformed to the Protestant religion. The bishops' certi ficates end in 1782, and the ministers' then begin, and continue in regular succession to a late period. The bundles contain cer tificates from the Prothonotaries of the Superior Courts of Law, and from other officers, before whom affidavits were made, stating that every such person so conforming had, within a limited time (six months), received the Sacrament, and per formed the other legal requisites. Those certificates commence in 1709, and end in 1781, and were filed in the Rolls' Office,"], [41, "PREFACE. XXXIII where they are now conveniently arranged and preserved, as also the bishops' and ministers' certificates, which are likewise kept in bundles. The Roman Catholic Rolls, commencing in 1778, contain the qualifications of Roman Catholics, and were made up and prepared by certain officers in the Courts of Exchequer, Queen's Bench, and Common Pleas, and by the Clerks of the Peace, who occasionally, as it suited their convenience, returned them into this office, many of them in a state so obliterated, obscure, and incorrect, that it is difficult to decipher the names on them ; here also are preserved the Rolls of qualifica tion of the forty-shilling freeholders, and Rolls of a similar nature, pursuant to 10\u00b0 George IV. The Rolls and Pleadings of the Palatine Court of Tip perary contain leases of lands from the Duke of Ormond, to several lessees, commencing in 1703, and endino- in 1714. The pleadings contain bills and answers, filed in the Court Palatine, commencing in 1662, and ending in 1714. Those documents were deposited in this office pursuant to an Act of Parliament, passed in the 2\u00b0 George I. The Letters of Guardianship and Committeeship of Luna tics, under the present arrangement, commence in 1796, and are kept in bundles, or upon files, and have an alphabetical book of reference made to them, which is in good order. The Fiats are next in point of number and importance. They comprise the original instruments under the Privy Seal, directing Letters Patent to be passed, and are authen ticated by the signature either of the Sovereign or of the Lords Justices or Lord Deputy of the time. They com mence in the 21st year of Henry VIII., and are continued to the present time. They were all supposed to be enrolled on the Patent Rolls, but numerous instances occur where the patent not being found on the Rolls, reference must be made to the original Fiat, or in the event of the Roll being lost, or in any portion illegible, the examination of the Fiat serves to supply the deficiency ; those records, in consequence, have always been considered of great value. They are pre served in large bundles, generally arranged according to the c"], [42, "PREFACE. XXXIV years of the reign. To the reign of Elizabeth and James I. there is an index nominum, but none to those subsequent to the latter date. These instruments are of the more value, considering that if accident happen to any of the Patent Rolls, they can be replaced, in a great measure, by the Fiats. An interesting and numerous class of records here are the Inquisitions post mortem. Those records, which are very nume rous, and highly valuable in many respects, commence in the reign of Elizabeth and extend to the Restoration, soon after which they ceased. They were taken under Commissions, directed to the Escheators of each Province, and found on the oaths of a jury what lands any person died seized of, by what rents and services they were held, who was the next heir, and his age, by which the right of the Crown to escheat or wardship was ascertained. They are the best evidence of descents and property, and the rights and privileges appendant to property, during the period they embrace, and their findings often con tain transcripts of deeds, wills, and other legal instruments of which there may be no other evidence existing. They thus became the means, in many instances, of l-egistering or per petuating deeds and other evidences anterior to the institu tion of the General Registry in 1708. Inquisitions on Attainder commence in the reign of Eliza beth, and continue to the reign of William III., very few being subsequent thereto. They were holden under Commis sions directed like the former, and show whether any person was attainted, in which case his lands, which also were found were seized into the King's hands. Those Inquisitions are first classed into four provinces, and then subdivided into counties. They are carefully and con veniently preserved in suitable portfolios, and are easy of access. Previous to their present arrangement they suffered much from damp and want of proper care, but further injury from decay has been effectually arrested by the means at pre sent adopted for their preservation. To illustrate the great value of these important documents, independent of dieir legal and historical value, it frequently occurs that where, from want of accurate information, we are unable to find"], [43, "PREFACE. XXXV a particular patent, we can generally satisfy the inquiry suggested, by referring to the Inquisitions of that particular county, and to this extent they supply the want of the patent. Here are also preserved the celebrated Inquisitions find ing the title of Charles I. to the province of Connaught; they are called \" Strafford's Inquisitions,\" having been taken before that nobleman in the years 1635 and 1637. They include all the lands in the province, and the names of the tenants and holders thereof at the time, with the exception of the county of Leitrim, of which county no Inquisition appears to have been taken. The oldest Transmiss of Public and Private Acts of Parlia ment preserved in this office is in the reign of Henry VII. Thence they continue until the time of the Union. One in the reign of Henry VIII. grants the title of King of Ireland to that Monarch. They are in good preservation, but there is no list of them, or index of any kind. These records, which had been previously preserved in the Parlia mentary Office, were transferred to this office for preservation at the time of the Union, by the directions of the late Lord Chancellor Clare. There are also remaining in the Rolls' Office sundry original records, called \" Miscellanea,\" which cannot be classed under any of the previous heads. They consist of surveys, charters, rentals, patents, and other instruments, which may not now be necessary to detail, but they are all, in common with the Rolls and other records of the office, of value and interest, and my experience enables me, on all occasions, to consult them without much difficulty. Another class of interesting records here preserved are royal presentations to ecclesiastical benefices, many of which devolved to the Crown, by the 32\u00b0 Henry VIII., many by forfeiture, and many stated to be \"per lapsum temporis,\" \" devoluto jure,\" \" vel quocunque alio modo,\" manifesting that the Crown was anxious to perpetuate its title and to establish proofs for succeeding generations. The MS. Book of Common Prayer, to which reference is made by the Statute of Uniformity, was, before the Union,"], [44, "XXXVI PREFACE. preserved in the Irish Parliament Office, and is now deposited in the Rolls Office; it is a folio volume containing 283 leaves. As doubts have been expressed whether this manu script book is the one originally annexed to the Statute of Uniformity, 17\u00b0 & 18\u00b0 Car. H., c. 6, it may be useful to ex plain that, in the reign of Charles II., the mode pursued for enacting a Statute for Ireland was as follows : \u2014 the Bill passed the Irish Parliament and was transmitted by the Lord Lieu tenant of Ireland to England, in order to receive the assent of the Lords and Commons in England, and then it was re turned by the King to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who, upon its receipt, in consequence of a writ to that effect, went down to the House of Lords and gave the royal assent. The Statute was then deposited in the L'ish Parliament Office and a copy sent to the Rolls. It is, however, extraordinary, that no copy either of the Book of Common Prayer belonging to the English Act of Uniformity, or of that belonging to the Irish Act of Uni formity, was forwarded to the Rolls Chapel in England, or to the Rolls Office in Ireland ; and it may also be remarked, that of the calendar and tables annexed to Statute 24\u00b0 George H., c. 23, no trace is to be found amongst the Rolls at the Rolls Chapel. This MS. volume, which is attached to the Act of Uni formity, is the only original in existence, the MS. which was attached to the English Act of Uniformity having been long since lost. The English Prayer Books have been taken from what were called \" Sealed Books,\" that is, certified copies of the original. But in these sealed books were several mistakes, as appears by the original in the Rolls Office. This MS. has been printed by the Ecclesiastical History Society ; and the editor (Archibald John Stephens, Esq.,) con ceived that the only proper plan for him to adopt was to give, as near as possible, a facsimile of the original, and thus not to take upon himself to decide whether the alterations were made before or after the enactment of the Statute, or to specu late upon the words, letters, or punctuation which have been obliterated."], [45, "PREFACE. XXXVII Amid the vast accumulation of records and muniments which is to be found in the archives of this country, none justly stand in higher estimation than the Patent Rolls of Chancery, whether considered in respect to the antiquity, utility, or variety of the documents with which they abound. To give effect to the royal pleasure, when signified under the sign manual, or by privy signet, in favour of any indivi dual or body politic or corporate, letters patent, specifying the inducement, and defining the nature, extent, and tenure of the grant, with the conditions and penalties annexed, were directed to issue under the great seal of the kingdom. The Patent Rolls (patentes) were those open grants from the Crown, for they were open to the inspection of all, and so called patent. The Close Rolls (clauses) were so called, because they contained writs from the Crown, sealed and directed to the officers by whom they were received, and to whom alone they were open ; as also royal letters, obligations, recogni zances, deeds ; but it is to be observed, that any differences which might have originally existed between the Close and Patent Rolls was discontinued in the reign of Charles I. The enrolment of these instruments was not required by law until the Statute of Charles rendered it imperative ; yet, in times antecedent thereto, it was no unusual thing to insert in the patent, a clause nullifying the grant, unless enrolled within a given time ; and, even in the absence of such provi sion, the patentees themselves had recourse, in most instapces, to this precaution, for their own security, and to avoid the inconvenience, if not loss, resulting from neglect; for it some times occurred that the king was deceived in granting to one subject what had been previously passed away from the Crown in favour of another, no record existing of the previous grant. The Patent Rolls, although commencing with a Roll of the tenth year of King Edward I., contain grants made by King Henry IL, by John, as well when Earl of Morton as when king ; by King Henry III. and King Edward I. With the exception of the reigns of the first three Edwards, in which some chasms exist, and a chasm in the reign of Henry"], [46, "XXXVIII PREFACE. VIII., during the first twenty years of whose reign there is but one Roll (of the sixth) remaining, the series forms almost one continuous and unbroken chain down to the present time. How this loss occurred has never been clearly ascer tained; but the res gest\u00e6 of the reign of Henry VIII. are pretty accurately written by Sir James Ware, and some interesting evidences relating to it will be found in Rymer; and copious materials connected with this period of the English history of Ireland will be found in Lambeth Library, in which are preserved the indentures and treaties of peace between the Chief Governor and the Irish chief tains, letters, petitions, orders, instructions, journals, acts [of council, submissions, inquisitions, and other MSS., to the reign of James I. Those records cover a period of time which, of itself, speaks their antiquity; and, as regards the utility and variety of them, whether the labours of the antiquary, the objects of the historian, the pursuits of the legal practi tioner, or the purposes of general inquiry are to be served ; they may be best explained by the enumeration of the cha racter of the documents which have been previously detailed. To explore these stores of information and unfold their contents is the object, as far as it extends, of the present work. Here the historian and antiquary will find the letters and correspondence of Henry VIII., Edward VI., MaryT, and Elizabeth with the Lord Deputy and the Irish Executive, commending their zeal, summoning parliaments, parcelling out entire territories, incorporating towns, and ennobling the meritorious ; conciliating the Irish chieftains, or, as they were called, \" Captains of their nations,\" negociating with them for the surrender of their territories, and enjoining their due obedience and submission to the English rule, language, and costume ; treaties of peace and submissions of the Irish chief tains. The great M'Carthy More, after ravaging the south, comes \"sans protection,\" before the Lord Deputy, describing himself as the \" most unworthy and unnatural Earl, who, with inward sorrow of mind and most hearty repentance, recalling the great benefits and exceeding bounty he received from her Majesty, and the degree of honour and pre-eminence he had"], [47, "PREFACE. XXXIX been most unworthily called unto, far greater than ever he, a cursed creature, could have deserved, with bitter tears and great compunction of mind, most humbly confesses, which the more aggravates the enormity of his offences, and heaps upon him more abundantly her Majesty's most just indignation, that, being seduced by that pernicious rebel, Fitz-Maurice and the Geraldines, forgetting his duty to God and her Majesty, he was, by subtle enticements and most wicked per suasions, induced to take a rash oath, which done, he entered into that fury and madness of rebellion against his sovereign, confederating with Butler and the rest of the rebels, whereby, he swerved from his allegiance, by traitorously raising her Majesty's subjects, burning houses and castles, and sundry other grievous offences and heinous and detestable treasons deserving extreme punishment and sharp correction ; which as he could not justify or defend, so he, prostrate before the Deputy and Council, with most penitent and humble mind, freely submitted his life, goods, and lands to the disposition of her Majesty, beseeching their lordships to have compassion on him and intercede with her Majesty, that she would vouchsafe to receive him, the most vile and unworthy wretch of the creation, to her clemency and mercy; and he under takes to pray to God to grant her Highness a most prosperous and happy reign, and that it would please Him to unveil his eyes and grant him grace to remain in her dutiful service, which he now dedicates to her Majesty, to the last drop of his blood.\" Cavana oh undertakes to maintain the accustomed fairs in his territory ; and not permit any wicked, nefarious, or plun dering act to be committed at the pass, either by land or water ; and will banish and repudiate all their idle men ; none of them will ride armed, save the Captain ; and will not exact, beyond the bounds of their own country, any exactions, \" coyne, or livery.\" Savage is to give the Lord Leonard Gra}% for his favour and friendship, 100 fat cows, one good horse, or fifteen Irish marks in lieu of the latter. O'Byrne undertakes to serve at the hostings with his followers, at his own expense, and he will pay to the king 4c/.

He under- takes not to harbour the O'Tools, or succour any of them flying for protection, and he will send to the hosting a banner with twenty horsemen and a proportionate number of footmen, according to the usage of his country. O'Karroll will find provision in his county for eighty sparres or galloglasses, for a quarter of a-year, and will furnish twelve good horsemen and twenty -four foot soldiers. De Burgo covenants that each captain of his county shall pay \u00a340 yearly rent to the king and 100 marks for his nomination. O'Molloy undertakes to serve the Deputy against the traitor O'Connor, and maintain Lord M'Geoghegan. O'Toole will use the English costume and manner, and the English language to the best of his know- ledge ; the Great Desmond, affects superlative demonstration of sorrow and penitential expression of his anguish at his treason and defection; and Shane O'Neill, when he could no longer keep the Claneboy with \" the strong hand,\" pathetically la ments his great ingratitude to his generous mistress. The lawyer will find the economy of judicial proceedings of Chancery at this remote period \u2014 the bill, answer, replica tion, rejoinder, decree, mandamus, and injunction, and, what is indicative of the temper of the times, the removal of suits to the decision of the Lord Deputy and Council, when the petitioner was apprehensive of a failure of justice in the regions \" without the Pale.\" The defeat in the north of the chieftains, Shane O'Neil, O'Donnell, O'Dogherty, and Maguire, in the reign of Eliza beth, afforded an opportunity of planting that portion of the country ; Desmond, in the south, having rushed to arms, was overthrown, and his vast territory confiscated. In consequence, we find the patents rapidly increasing, and assuming, for the first time, a character of order and precision commensurate with the improvement of the period, the facilities of Encdish communication, and the desire, by express and definite pro visions, to extirpate the pre-existing tenures of the Irish : for bidding the assumption of the Irish costume or sirname\u2014 th_T division of lands according to the ancient custom of o-avel kind \u2014 the use of the Brehon laws or the laws of Tanistrv"], [49, "XLI PREFACE. and enjoining the inhabitants, in all modes and on all occa sions, to adopt the English habits, language, government, rules and costume. The inquirer into the state of the Church will find the nomination of the bishops and clergy, the removal of the in competent, the establishment of the reformed faith, and the pro ceedings of the historian Bale , of whom the Queen , writing (after his flight from his bishoprick) to Sentleger, says, \" send over the books and writings of Bale, a man that hath byn studious in the serche for the history and antiquities of this our realme, which he left behind him, in the tyme of our late sister Quene Mary, when he was occasioned to depart out of Ireland, for the illustration and setting forth of the ' story e? of this our realme by him the said Bale.\" In addition to all that had been done in relation to the pub lication of the English records, on the 26th of January, 1857, the Master of the Rolls of England submitted to the Trea sury a proposal for the publication of materials for the history of England from the Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII. His Honor suggested that these materials should be selected for publication under competent editors, without reference to periodical or chronological arrangement, without mutilation or abridgement; preference being given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most scarce and valuable. He proposed that each chronicle or historical document to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the editor were engaged on an editio princeps; and for this pur pose the most correct text should be formed from an accurate collation of the best MSS. To render the work more generally useful, the Master of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an account of the MSS. in question ; that he should add to the work a brief account of the life and times of the author, and any remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but no other note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be necessary to establish the correctness of the text. The works to be published in octavo, separately, as they d"], [50, "XLII PREFACE. were finished ; the whole responsibility of the task resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the Master of the Rolls, with the sanction of the Treasury. The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, after a careful con sideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a Trea sury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan recom mended by the Master of the Rolls \" was well calculated for the accomplishment of this national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner, within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements, without unnecessary expense.\" They expressed their approbation of the proposal that each chronicle and historical document should be edited in such a manner as to represent, with all possible correctness, the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the best manuscripts. They suggested, however, that the preface to each work should contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author, so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose, and an estimate of his historical credibility and value. In consequence of this decision, several most interesting volumes have been already given to the public ; amongst them, \" Royal and Historical Letters during the Reign of Henry IV. ;\" \" Historia Regis Henrici Septimi a Ber- nardo Andrea Theolosato Conscripta, necnon alia qu\u00e6dam ad eundem Regem Spectantia ;\" \" Muniments Gildhali\u00e6 Londoniensis ;\" \" Liber albus, liber custumarum et liber horn ;\" \" Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon \" (2 vols.) ; \" Monumenta Franciscana ;\" \" Capgrave's Chronicle of Eng- land;\" \"Lives of Edward the Confessor;\" \"Memorials of Henry V. ;\" \"Political Poems and Songs, composed durino- the period from the accession of Edward the III. to that of Richard III. ;\" \" Bartholom\u00e6i de Cotton Monachi Norwicen- sis Historia Anglicana\" (1298); \"Historia Monasterii S. Augustini Cantuariensis ;\" \"Capgrave's Book of the Illus- trious Henries, and Translation\" (2 vols.); \"The Chronicles of Scotland ;\" and perhaps to us the most valuable and inter esting of all, \"Hamilton's Calendar of the State Papers"], [51, "XLIII PREFACE. relating to Ireland \" during the period embraced by the fol lowing work, and to which it affords, in many instances, an admirable clue and interpretation. The Master of the Rolls of Ireland, solicitous for the publi- cation of the Irish Records, following the example so success- fully presented in the sister country, recommended to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury the propriety of printing andpublishing calendars or repertories tothePatent, Close, and Statute Rolls, and other important legal muniments of this country, and their Lordships willingly acceded to his Honor's suggestion. This work, therefore, undertaken by their Lordships' authority, under the direction of the Master of the Rolls, has for its object to rescue some part of the most important of our national muniments from the com- parative oblivion and obscurity in which, by reason of the diffi- culty of access and the labour of research, they now lie in- volved ; to facilitate the researches of persons engaged in his- torical investigation and inquiry, and whatever light it may throw on our public records, in directing either the pursuits of the historian, the antiquary, or of the legal practitioner, it is to the Government they must feel themselves indebted for the encouragement afforded in extricating and evolving their contents from technical phrases, wordy parentheses, and legal forms of diction. It purports to contain an abstract of every instrument on the Rolls ; condensed and translated into English ; all abbreviations and contractions have been rejected; all technical phraseology discarded. The purport of each docu- ment has been minutely and accurately analyzed ; the sub stance of every important clause and provision extracted, and the names of every person and place in each accurately speci- fied, with a view of rendering accessible to the public the original MSS., obscured as they now are in obsolete languages and modes of expression ; written in antiquated and nearly unknown character, obscure and frequently illegible, rendered more embarrassing by abbreviations, which frequently leave the number, gender, or tense of a word difficult of ascer tainment ; and which might, if not in time rescued from obli vion, ultimately share the fate of the memorials of Babylon"], [52, "XLIV PREFACE. or Nineveh, and like the Rosetta stone, depend for interpre tation upon the chance discovery of some ingenious student. The decayed state of many of these rolls interposed diffi culties in the execution of the work, but corresponding exer tion has been made, as it was thought desirable to rescue as much as possible of these our early records from oblivion \u2014 Si successus s\u00e6pe, labor certe nunquam, deficit. In extenuation of the faults, from which I dare not hope this work is free, I would plead, that in the performance of this task, I have had to rely solely on my own resources, at intervals snatched from the labours of official duties ; that I have, to the best of my ability, faithfully rendered the translation; and, grateful for the important trust reposed in me, I have sought to compensate for my conscious imperfec tions by untiring zeal and industry.

A contemporary historian thus describes the Irish troops : \u2014 \" The Irish observe divers degrees, according to which each man is regarded ; the basest sort amongst them are little young wags, called Daltins: these are lackeys, and are serviceable to the grooms or horseboys, who are a degree above the Daltins. Of the third degree is the Kern, who is an ordinary soldier, using for weapon his sword and target, and sometimes his piece, being commonly so good marksmen as they will come within a score of a great castle ; Kern signifieth, as noblemen of great judgment informed me, a shower of hell, because they are taken for no better than Rakehells, or the Devil's blaguards. The fourth degree is the Galloglass, using a kind of pollard for his weapon ; these men are commonly way ward, rather by profession than by nature; grim of countenance, tall of stature, big of limb, burly of body, well and strongly timbered, chiefly feeding on beef, pork, and butter. The fifth degree is to be an horseman, which is the chiefest next the Lord and Captain ; these horsemen, when they have no stay of their own, gad and range from house to house, like errant Knights of the Round Table, and they never dismount 'till they ride into the hall and as far as the table. There is among them a brotherhood of Karrowes, that proffer to play at cards all the year long, and make it their only occupation ; they play away mantle and all to the bare skin, and then truss themselves in straw or leaves ; they wait for passengers on the highway, invite them to game upon the green, and ask no more than com panions to make them sport; for default of other stuff they pawn their glibs, their fingers and toes, which they lose or redeem at the courtesy of the winner. One office in the house of a nobleman is a tale-teller, who bringeth his lord asleep, with tales, frivolous and vain, whereunto the number give sooth and credit.\""], [351, "I553-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 299 7 Edw.

A dispute for supremacy had long raged between the Sees of Dublin and Armagh, both of which claimed the Primacy ; after much acri monious discussion and repeated appeals, it was at length agreed, as a mode of re conciling the claims of the contending parties, that each prelate should be entitled to primatial dignity, and erect his crozier in the diocese of the other ; that the Arch bishop of Dublin should be contented with the title of Primate of Ireland, while the Archbishop of Armagh should receive that of Primate of all Ireland. The distinc tion had been acquiesced in by all parties; but the King reversed this decision, and by patent the See of Armagh was deprived of the superior title, which with all its powers and privileges was conferred on the Archbishop of Dublin and his successors for ever.

On consideration of the premises, and as the Earl could not deny the title of the Corporation, nor could show any thing material but the grant of Edward I., which only took effect where prise wines were at that time due, it was ordered by the Lord Deputy and Council, that the Sovereign, Portrieve, Bur gesses, and Commons, and their successors, should be exonerated and acquitted of the prise wines against the Earl and his heirs for ever.

The controversy for the pos session of Kilfekyle, should be heard by the Commissioners, and if the Earl of Ormond had entered by force into the house, the Earl of Desmond should be restored to the possession. The Earl of Ormond should have the royalties and liberties of Tipperary, accord ing to the judgment of the two Chief Justices, Sir Robert Catlin and Sir James Dyer, to whom her Majesty had referred the decision of the case.

Concerning the furtherance of religion in Munster, he says that having himself no learning, he is ignorant what is to be done in that behalf; but whatever the Commissioners suggest for that purpose, he is content to maintain to the utmost of his power. Touching the contention between the Earl of Ormond and him, the latter desires that four indifferent persons should be chosen, so that peace may be established between them, and security should be given for performance of this treaty.

Memorandum of the delivery of seisin, Names of the witnesses, Membrane 4. 15 Charter of restitution of Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The grant commences with a recital of the foundation charter of Arch bishop Comin ; next follows that of Henry de Loundres, whereby he established a dean and three other dignitaries, in the college which had been founded by his predecessor ; it then recites a patent of Edward IV., which divided the prebend of Luske between the precentor and treasurer, conferred the rectory of Newcastle on the Archdeacon of Glendalach, established three new prebends in the churches of Saint Audeon, Kilmactalway, and Wicklow, which had, previously, been possessed by the dignitaries above mentioned ; next follows the act of surrender to the Commissioners nominated by Henry VIII , and the certificate of the same to the king. Their Majesties then proceed to mention the motives which urged them to restore this cathedral to its pristine dignity ; they recount how much it had been the care of their predecessors and its own pastors to adorn the same, and how for promotion of the worship of God within the realm of Ireland, it had been their study to place therein persons eminent for their learning, whom they had enriched with competent revenues, to the intent, that hospitality should there prevail for the relief of numbers, and that the youth of the king dom should be instructed in civility of manners and the rules of moral virtue ; all which pious intentions had their full effect, so long as the cathedral remained undissolved ; but having observed that, since the resignation of his inheritance, great evils had arisen, both from decay of hospitality, the want of a place where youth might receive their education as was accustomed, and, most of all, that the honour and worship of the Divine Majesty had declined ; they were moved, therefore, to decree that the Cathedral and Colle giate Church of Saint Patrick should be restored to its pristine state. Accordingly, with consent of Sir Anthony Sentleger, her Deputy, Sir Thomas Cusake, Chancellor, and others of the Privy Council, they decreed that the said Cathedral Church should, ac cording to the tenor of their letters of Privy Seal, dated 23rd February, be forthwith restored ; the same to consist of a dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, two archdeacons, twenty-two pre bendary canon -priests, six minor canon-priests, sixteen vicars choral priests, aud six choristers. Furthermore, they ordained and"], [577, "1569.] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 525 11 Elizabeth. re-established the said church to be the cathedral church and archi episcopal seat of the Archbishop of Dublin, in as full and ample a manner as it was before its dissolution ; all honours, privileges, and immunities, whatsoever, which the said cathedral, every person, member of the same, had before possessed or enjoyed, were likewise declared to be restored. The charter then proceeds to nominate the several clerks, each to his respective dignity or prebend, those benefices being all, at that time, in the gift of the crown, by reason of the vacancy of the see; it declares the chapter to be a body corporate, for ever, having perpetual succession, in like manner as the dean and chapter of the cathedral and metropolitan Church of the Holy Trinity, annexed to the same archbishoprick ; that, as a corporate body, they may sue and be sued in all courts ; that they shall have, under the name of the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick, power to take, receive, alienate, or demise, in like manner as the dean or chapter of any other cathedral church within the realm, is, by law or custom, empowered to do ; and that they shall have a common seal. The charter then proceeds to restore, in the most ample manner, all the possessions or immunities, of whatsoever kind, which had been previously possessed by them, and confirms the same to them, and their successors for ever : To hold from the festival of Easter preceding, in free and perpetual alms, and in as full and perfect a manner as their pre decessors did at any time possess the same ; they are likewise empowered to ordain, from time to time, such laws as they shall deem meet for their own government. And, moreover, the charter proceeds, considering that the possessions of the said dean and canons are, at these present times, scarce sufficient for their support, and that the tenants of the lands of the church have been harassed by the officers and farmers of the crown revenues ; the said digni taries and canons and their farmers are hereby, of special favour, taken under the protection of the crown ; and, therefore, all officers of the same are specially commanded to be at all times protectors and defenders of the said church, and all members of the same, and all the property to them belonging ; neither at any time, says the charter, shall bay, corn, horses, carriages, or cattle, the property of any member of the said cathedral, or any tenant of the same be taken or employed for the service of the crown, or any of its servants, without the consent of the owner. In consideration of this donation and restitution, the dean and chapter were required to maintain for ever a schoolmaster and usher, to teach grammar, and the same number of poor alms-men as the church was wont to maintain before the late dissolution; which alms-men are, at all times to be nominated by the Deputy, or Lord Lieutenant for the time being, being maimed or disabled persons of honest conversation and manners, who have served the crown faithfully in Ireland ; the nomination of the schoolmaster was reserved to the archbishop, and both the school-house aud alms-house, which was established by letters patent on the dissolution of the cathedral, were hereby dissolved : by the final clause the right of electing their"], [578, "526 PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [1569- 11 Elizabeth. dean from their own body was confirmed, which privilege they are empowered to exercise in the same manner they did before the dis solution ; and, moreover, the archbishop's right of patronage in the benefices was restored to him, to possess the same in as full and ample a manner as he was used, before the cathedral had been dis solved. \u2014 June 15, i\u00b0 & 20 Bhilip and Mary.

The Lords of the Privy Council in England to Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy, \" Of late we received letters from your Lordship with a case therein containing these words, 'Whereas for the space of sour hundred years and more, in the city of Dublin there have been two churches accounted cathedrals, each having a several chapter, dean, and seal, the consents of both and the seals of both having been accustomed to be had and put to every grant made of anything appertaining to the archbishop; the last year of King Henry VIIL, the one church, namely, Saint Patrick's, with the consent of the dean and the most part of the chapter of the same, in their chapter house, did yield and give up, without the assent of the bishop, into the king's possession, the said church and all things thereto belonging, to him, his heirs and successors ; whether this was a lawful dissolution or surrender or no, is the first doubt, for the bishop consented not to it. Then the same bishop, in King Edward's reign, and before the restitution of Saint Patrick's, made a lease with the consent of the dean and chapter of the other church, named Christ Church only, for that indeed Saint Patrick's was, in all opinion and assurance, dissolved, the priests excluded, the lands dissipated, and the church converted to lay uses ; whether this lease thus made be good to bind the successor or no, is the second doubt.' By your Lordship's letter we were requested, for that some difficulty and doubt grew upon the said case before your Lordship, to send you our opinions and resolutions thereon, whereby your Lordship might be the better satisfied and instructed of your judgment to be given in that behalf. These be therefore to signify unto your Lordship, that we have not only heard the matter and cause debated by learned counsel, both on behalf of the Archbishop of Dublin, and also on behalf of Roger Brereton, between whom we 2 M"], [582, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, 530 [1569. 11 Elizabeth. understand the matter doth rise in question before your Lordship, but also have, at several times, made special meetings and conferences amongst ourselves touching the matter, and in the end, with delibe rate consideration, do think upon the case, that, for as much as it seems to us by the case, for anything we have yet heard to the con trary, that the grant surrendered or given up of the church of Saint Patrick, and of all things thereto belonging, was and is a law ful and perfect dissolution or surrender of the said ehurch, and of the corporation and chapter thereof, and that, by reason thereof, there remained not any chapter to the said bishop, but only the dean and chapter of Christ Church, which was still \"in esse\" at the time the lease was made and confirmed by the dean and chapter ; we take it that the lease, made afterwards by the archbishop with the only assent of the dean and chapter of Christ Church, to be good and effectual in the law to bind in succession, for that the corpora tion of the dean and chapter of Saint Patrick's was then dissolved, and had no being; and albeit that it hath been sekom seen that our opinions are used to be set forth in writing, but only in such judicial places as we are called unto, where as judges we speak judiciously ; yet considering your Lordship's place of service and good zeal to direct causes according to the common laws of the realm, we thought it good to advertize your Lordship of our opinions, hoping that we shall not be often troubled with the like ; reserving, nevertheless, our liberties upon further matter to be showed hereafter in this case, as reason is, and so commit your Lordship to the tuition of the Allmighty.
